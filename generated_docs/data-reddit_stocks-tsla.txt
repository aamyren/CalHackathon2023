POST_TEXT: b'Im in my early 20s in college and devout about 70% of my paycheck into 5 stocks, like the title says: TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, GOOGL, and APPL.\n\nWhy does this feel like a both good and bad long term strategy of investing? On one side, I cant see these stocks going anywhere, tech only will expand, and even if tech stocks crash, these stocks seem to be able to extend beyond just tech, ie TSLA with cars, AMZN with grocery stores, APPL with, well, phones and computers, Microsoft seemingly expanding to being a company that branches far past tech, and even Google even though operation as a search engine seems to have and will continue to cement themselves as a leading corporation in America.\n\nOf course, Im not saying anything special. Im just wondering, is this a foolish plan? I know diversification is important, but it seems just dumping as much as I can in these stocks for the next 20 years is a solid investment strategy that should enable me to become financially free and eligible for ret'
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 07:41:28'] You're thinking of investing in the #1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 largest companies in the world by market cap.If you did this 20 years ago, you would have invested in WMT, GM, F, GE, and CVX.  That would have netted you a 107% return in 20 years.  One of those companies went bankrupt, and one is trading lower today than it was 20 years ago.If you just invested in $SPY instead you'd have collected 407% returns.$SPY is already >20% composed of the 5 stocks you're picking anyway.  You already have massive exposure to big tech in a broad index fund, and you have the advantage of the index fund culling the losers and adding exposure to the winners for you.What you're considering doing is not a good idea for you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 07:49:40'] Unless you are one of these investors including myself bought at the peak in Q4 2021, you are hoping for a + 25% Amzn, +19.6% Google, and  +NFLX 33.7% recovery almost 2 years later to break it even.  That is the risk with these stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 06:13:55'] If you‚Äôre going to go tech I‚Äôd suggest a tech etf and diversify. FTEC is my favorite. QQQM is a great long term hold. But the big winners and largest companies each decade rarely stay the same decade after decade. Tech is always open to disruption.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 06:42:12'] Why not simplify and go S&P 500 via VOO. Those stocks already dominate the index anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 08:49:16'] The fact that you "can‚Äôt see these stocks going anywhere" should be a huge red flag for yourself. Just diversify man or be the billionth young buck that has to learn the hard way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 06:30:55'] We also thought yahoo mail is not going to go anywhere and IBM was one of the most innovative companies in the 2000s.  If you want to play safe, go with index funds. If you want to take some risk with individual stocks, identify good growth stocks which are trading cheap. Examples: PYPL, SQ, DOCU, DIS, BAND.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 09:19:41'] Risky. Much of those stocks are priced in that they require significant continued growth to justify their valuation. While they should all continue to exist in your time frame, that does not mean they will provide a good return on investment. Equities are a short term voting machine and a long term weighing machine. Most people do not understand this simple statement. Essentially a stock has to make in profits (and ultimately cash flow) to remain highly valued. But in the short term (year to few years), investors may be excited and 'vote' a equity to a high valuation that can collapse fairly easy. Take your Tesla stock for example. They have a valuation that indicates they need to expand in such a way that they sell more cars then all the large current automakers combined. That likely will never happen. Possibly they may find other horizonal sectors to justify their valuation such as charging but at the moment it is priced on the short term voting but likely not weighing in on the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 06:29:33'] It‚Äôs not the worst idea, especially considering those companies essentially make up the majority of the indexes anyway, but it has its risks. Just because a company will ‚Äúalways be around‚Äù, doesn‚Äôt mean it will be always be valued at the current levels. GE and CSCO are famous examples of that. It‚Äôs also easy to look at the past 10 or 20 years and think it will always be like this, but literally no one knows what the future will hold. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs generally recommended to keep the majority of your investment funds in the indexes because it‚Äôs a lot more probable that the entire market will continue grow over the long term versus individual companies. So, I wouldn‚Äôt liquidate your tech positions, but I would probably start to allocate more money to indexes like VOO or VTI. In my Roth/retirement for example, I do hold some individual tickers like MSFT and BRK.B but I only allocate maybe 10% of the whole portfolio to those and the rest is in indexes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 07:23:32'] It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre consistently putting money into the market. You talk about not wanting to have to keep researching new companies, in which case investing your money into VOO/VTI might make more sense. However, the type of global transition that would need to take place for a company like Microsoft to lose their relevancy as a premier stock would likely entail an upheaval of the very same ETFs that are being recommended. Ultimately, I‚Äôm also young and am allocating a decent % of my portfolio to TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, and AAPL. These stocks don‚Äôt have much upside given their market cap but they are integral players in the world economy and should continue to be for the foreseeable future. However, 20 years is a LONG time for innovation to occur and for the world to change, so you need to be open to changing your strategy. If you really don‚Äôt want to research companies and want this as a set and forget 401k, it would make way more sense to build equity in an ETF like VOO/VTI in my opinion. Not only do those give you great exposure to the companies you mentioned, but it also wouldn‚Äôt require you to re-evaluate your investment strategy that you are relying on for retirement nearly as often.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 10:11:19'] What a pathetic subreddit. Is this r/stocks or r/etf ?Anyone who has been holding these stocks has vastly outperformed on the SP500 returns.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 06:15:46'] Taxes.  Are you doing much of this in a tax-protected account, if in US, at least for the first 6K per year?  I see that you want to retire at 40, but the taxes will kill you for that money you use past 59.5.  That could easily be 30 years of paying taxes on money from 60 to 90.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 06:33:53'] I have no issues with doing this‚Ä¶but I also wouldn‚Äôt set it and forget it. As someone who owns all of these stocks, with Apple representing 15% of my portfolio, it has been a great stock since when I bought it many many years ago. I‚Äôm a firm believer that none of these stocks are going anywhere, but I‚Äôd also pay attention to the market and economy. There have been previous giants in their respective marketplace that have gone belly up in the past. That being said, I think these companies are a safe play for continued long term growth and profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 09:54:05'] Only boring old outdated boomers who see crappy 5% yearly returns will use the .com bubble as an example. It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúwait until this internet fad is over‚Äù. Society advances with new tech, we adopt them, and they become too intertwined with our daily lives 1. APPL changed the world with the smartphone. everyone only use to leave their house with 2 things, their wallet and their car keys. Now it‚Äôs 3 things, wallet car keys smartphone. everyone and their tech illiterate parents and even some kids way too young leave their homes with a smart phone. You can thank APPL for that 2. You have any idea how many successful growing companies NOT in tech actually use tech for their daily operations? Almost every business has a IT department and either uses the cloud for either msft/amzn/goog for their business. If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre gonna get crushed by whoever your competition in your industry is. Countries governments/infrastructures are reliant on the cloud FFS. As time goes on cloud users will only grow overall. 20 years from now, as far as the US cloud services goes, these 3 are still gonna be the biggest cloud players taking and giving back  a few +- % market share from each other. 3. The most important power these companies have is money and the ability to buy people/other companies out before they become a threat to their market share. The chance of some unemployed genius super nerd tinkering in his moms garage right now with a super advanced smartphone device that can ‚Äúthreaten APPLS dominance‚Äù is basically non existent cause APPL will buy him out in the first place.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 06:21:26'] In theory? They could all talk. I‚Äôm certainly not expecting that, but an index automatically rebalances so there‚Äôs really no chance of it ever tanking, short of the economy collapsing. The question is will these handful of companies continue to lead growth, or will they fall off as other mega caps have in the past?

Sure, never know.But, until there is any indication to that affect, I think this is just boo boys being boo boys I‚Äôd also add, talking about historic valuations, historic multiples; it makes no senseWhy would a 20PE be fair value for a company growing revenue 50% annually for the past 5 years?Why would that sort of multiple be ‚Äúfair‚Äù when a company has 90% market share?Particularly since, the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù were deriving from are manufacturing companies, not mega conglomerates with endless, truly endless, amounts of cash, share buy backs, etc.I‚Äôd also add: we‚Äôre in the early stages of the internet, in my young lifetime, we went from ostensibly no internet, to high speed internet in your hand anywhere on earth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 11:39:02'] You can pick individual stocks, but make sure you are well diversified into different sectors. My entire portfolio is individual stocks, but I have exposure to tech, consumer staple, industrial, utilities, defense, retail, energy, pharma, real estate, etc. 100% into ETFs is okay for novice investors who don't want to put in any work, but individual stocks can and often times do provide higher returns than an ETF.As Warren Buffett says, buy a cross section of America. Hard to go wrong doing that as long as you do some research and don't buy companies on the verge of bankruptcy. I'd probably bet my left foot that AMZN will still be around in 20 to 30 years.

The one exception is Tesla, there is probably a world where that stock drops 50%+ and never recovers. Its seems a little risky for me in a 401k.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 09:06:25'] First of all, nobody can see the future more than 5 years out. Nobody. So claiming that in 20 years you'll be fine is hubris. It's already been said that GM, IBM, GE, WMT underperformed and wouldn't have helped you retire alone. I hate mutual funds. ETFs are slightly better. But diversification among sectors is probably better. I'm currently in Big Tech, Chips, and Oil/Gas.    Those 3 things aren't going away soon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 09:29:37'] What could happen?Tesla is a bubble stock. A panic happens, people stop thinking Musk is Tony Stark and the whole thing collapses.Amazon probably OK for a few more yearsMicrosoft probably safe tooGoogle: personally I seem to use Google search less and less. Too much news stuff for me but maybe it works.Apple: having the latest phone stops being a thing that matters and/or it stops being jewelry. Most people start buying cheap droids instead. When that happens, 30+% of Apple's profit gets wiped out.Of all of these, Apple and Tesla are the ones I'd avoid.

However, that‚Äôs awesome you‚Äôre starting so young.It‚Äôs fine I would still make sure you‚Äôre putting some into an index within an ira each year. That‚Äôs step 1. There is certainly alot that can go wrong. Outside of Tsla these are some of my largest positions so I‚Äôm bullish but have to be realistic. The market caps are huge so there is plenty of room for error. They won‚Äôt keep compounding endlessly. Government intervention would happen if they did so but probably won‚Äôt even be needed. Also look at past mega caps someone usually knocks them off eventually.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 13:03:05'] Ok here‚Äôs my advice and it‚Äôs very simple and hopefully not too many will disagree. Instead of doing just tech- you‚Äôre putting your eggs in one very highly inflated basket. put it into a much more broad basket which is really a bunch of smaller baskets. I‚Äôm talking about the S&P 500. For example my main mutual fund S&P 500 is SWPPX. It nearly perfectly mirrors the index and it‚Äôs very low expense. For reference the s&p 500 usually rises 10% a year on average
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 13:25:45'] Generally it is advisable to keep a single stock to 3% or less of your portfolio. That way if and when a company fails or stops performing well it doesn't sink your ship.Relying on 5 companies that have already had massive growth is very risky and not guaranteed to beat index funds over the long term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 07:44:54'] I think they will be cash flow machines (minus TSLA) for the forseeable future and will all be competitive in any cutting edge advancements in technology, however they are all already so large that the upside is less enticing for someone so young. I think it would eventually just transform into a dividend strategy which is fine but I‚Äôd rather just diversify via VOO.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 07:49:33'] I would buy some NASDAQ ETF that gives you a large exposure to these companies, which has the benefit of being managed and rebalanced every once in a while to account for rising and falling trends. Like others have said, if you go back even just 30 years, you‚Äôll see a completely different set of companies that were the biggest market cap tech stocks at the time. Also, there‚Äôs recency bias in choosing Tesla now rather than 5 years ago. Let‚Äôs say if Palantir ends up where Tesla is now in 5 years and some other 20 year old then were to repeat this and chose Palantir as their 5, what would you make of that? No matter how unfathomable it is to see these 5 companies not stick around or perform well for the foreseeable future, give it long enough and they will mature and not perform as well as you would maybe hope. The best way to combat this, of course, is to just buy some ETF that places heavy weighs on these 5 companies. The way I see it, your approach is strictly worse than the ETF approach

So always ask what can go wrong. It is entirely possible that your 5 stock picks continue to skyrocket and you significantly outperform.

That is the key‚Ä¶ risk.You could outperform significantly. But you subject yourself to undue risk.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 09:34:49'] If your strategy is to just dump money into these companies and not look at it, probably best to just invest in the SP500, so you have some diversification going on. It will still have significant exposure to these companies (20%+), but you're not betting it all on 5 companies that might or might not continue to beat the market over a 20 year time period.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 09:47:11'] Probably a good idea to diversify

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 10:03:36'] Owning individual stocks is never easy and relaxing. You need to keep monitoring those companies because there is no guarantee any of those names will be dominant in 20 years. I'd suggest you go with QQQ if you want tech or VTI if you want broad market exposure.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 10:09:26'] VGT is one of my favorite choices to long tech if you don't want to be a VOO boomer. I'm trying to run \~70% VGT and 30% tech stocks with fundamentals that support growth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 11:12:25'] Yes, it‚Äôs foolish.1. Still know GE? They once were like Google is today.2. Or better, RCA?3. Even if those companies don‚Äôt go anywhere, there is still a huge chance they won‚Äôt always outperform the market. Other industries might become more relevant (just like tech replaced manufacturing as the dominating industry that attracts all the talent), other companies might become more relevant, these companies might suffer under bad management and not use their full potential etc.. You have to consider opportunity cost: Do those companies always deliver the best returns for your money?Most companies revert to the mean in the long run. So you make your portfolio extremely risky by reducing its diversification to basically zero compared to a broad market portfolio. Is that bet rewarded with extreme overperformance compared to the market? If the answer is no ‚Äî and in (retirement grade) long run, it most likely is ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bad financial decision. You‚Äôre taking a higher risk that is not rewarded equally higher.

Breakeven if you held before the crash took some years but if you bought more after you were very happy. Microsoft, Google, eBay had some great deals on stock lots of other too. It was some serious blood in the water situation a d if you had some cash it was an amazing opportunity. Same as covid crash. If you had some cash there were some great opportunities in various industries.

Plus I really dislike when anyone says it is different this time.  Because when someone says that 99% of the time it is not.But this is the 1%.  The difference is the reach.  Take Google.  They have 16 different services that have over 1/2 a billion daily active users.They have the most popular operating system in history with Android.  The most popular web site ever with search. The second most popular web site ever with YouTube.  The most popular email. The most popular mapping.  The most popular photo and the list goes on and on.   They now have 6 that have over 2 billion daily active users.Then they also have the most popular browser with more users than any other in history with Chrome.That just gives them an unbelievable amount of reach.  That is what is different.You will see all of these companies, including TSLA, a lot bigger 10 years from now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-25 21:15:09'] I did what you were thinking of about 15 years ago (invested it all in apple, google, Amazon, meta, Microsoft, NVidia and a few others). Did pretty well, annualized return of 18-20pct - far better than the standard 401k choices. The problem today is that these companies are so huge, I‚Äôm not sure that their stocks can continue to grow at that rate. So it really boils down to can you pick the winners for the next decade?

As the topped voted reply has already pointed out these names are already massive and you're betting on them growing even bigger/not being replaced by new companies.You'd almost certainly be better off putting that 70% (which is an insane amount btw, but you didn't ask about that) into an S&P 500 index fund if you're looking to retire in 20 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 04:38:34'] lol... what could go wrong by only being in tech?Just to be clear here - you are doing what everybody else is doing, but just a little extra. Extra into what everybody is excited about and has expectations about.I am not saying it is a wrong strategy, but if you are looking at risk mitigation, you are pretty exposed. > Yet, is it supposed to feel this easy?Well.. lol. yeah it is easy when you are just dumping money into the most valued and appreciated companies in the world. What you are doing is just picking what everybody else likes and doubling down on it. It might work out.Sears.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 04:48:36'] You got me to thinking about these companies. I think google and apple are really the most vulnerableI have ALWAYS been wrong about Tesla, I keep thinking they‚Äôll get beaten by the big guys when they start producing vehicles to compete. Having said that these deals to use the charging network is something I really never anticipated so I dunno - the umbrella Musk has can work together, I‚Äôd buy a car that had a starlink receiver built in and offered wifi free and that could be a thing (I‚Äôm not saying it is, I‚Äôm just thinking out loud).I rarely invest in big tech, it always seems too expensive to me
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 05:05:17'] Purchase VOO and ignore it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 06:14:37'] The honest truth is there is a range of outcomes, from lagging the S&P greatly to blowing it out of the water.  Nobody can know for certain but one thing is sure, I wouldn‚Äôt treat your strategy as a ‚Äúcan‚Äôt fail‚Äù one.  One thing seems certain here, your view is a consensus view as everyone has piled into those stocks recently.One of the most important elements is price, something that a lot of people ignore.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 06:18:42'] You may want to look at QQQM. It is weighted on those stocks you like but has exposure to others as well to help mitigate some of the risk. Plus since its an ETF they can rebalance if a company is not performing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 07:02:08'] It‚Äôs worth to keep that in mind, that 5 of them are strongly AI oriented, so probably through the upcoming years, they will try to undermine each other other.Musk is kicking off against Amazon cloud storage already, and MSFT bing searching empowered with open AI will go harder now against Google than ever before.
	COMMENT: ['2023-07-26 07:30:22'] Great selection of stocks to get into while you're young. I'll tell ya, tho, when I was your age I wish I had accepted one bit of wisdom that only, finally, resonated with me 30 years later: buy and hold.Bottom line: each of these is an extraordinarily well run company and all of them have superb balance sheets. Do not try to 'time the market'. Go with the flow and accept the down trends with the more common uptrends. Stay close to these companies. Listen out for ALL the news on them. That's the other part of 'buy and hold'. It's 'listen and learn'. Do not over react, just be ready to react.

	COMMENT: ['2023-07-22 12:42:56'] Musk is his own stock price manipulator who can bring the TSLA price up and down when he wants to based on his comments/strategy of selling cars. If people keep buying his cars and market does not care about margins and interest rates come down, I would expect the stock to go higher in long run but before Aug18 is questionable given the tech earnings are heating up next week and broader sell off could happen if the earnings are not good before bulls come in again but again Tesla is its own ecosystem and Musk does what he wants to.

POST_TEXT: b'Not sure if this is the correct forum for this discussion, but how do you all avoid FOMO from such huge rallies? \n\nI bought a lot of TSLA on margin at $160 and sold most of my shares at $250. I thought I made out like a bandit. It was the best trade of my life. I used the profits to pay taxes, go on a backpacking trip, close the margin account, and become totally debt free (aside from the mortgage.) \n\nHonestly it improved my life significantly. \n\nStill, now seeing it rise higher and higher, Ive got FOMO and want to take another margin loan to jump back in for more profits. I reached the goal but keep looking back like I couldve done more. \n\nIs this normal? How do you all avoid this feeling?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 04:04:59'] It's funny how the human mind works. We focus on the gains we missed, while completely forgetting the losses we avoided.  I have fomo about tesla. Especially since I was very close to buying it about 5 years ago. I instead bought "safer" stocks. But there were other stocks I considered buying at the time that since tanked,  but I never think about them!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 01:22:13'] 1) Get a paper trading account and buy a lot of Tesla stock. 2) Pretend that it's real money just how you pretend when you watch porn. 3) Watch as it eventually comes down. 4) Then buy back in with real money when it does. I know it seems like stocks like Tesla and Nvidia are invincible and nothing bad can happen to make them go on sale again. But something will. Remember last fall? It was the exact opposite - it seemed like stocks like Nvidia and Tesla would never recover and only keep on crashing. But they did recover.Now, get ready to watch as the reverse happens. It might not happen until later this year (who knows) but it will happen. There will always be chances to buy great stocks at cheap prices. There will always be more opportunities to buy low and sell high. Just don't FOMO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 02:39:17'] Actually understand the business that Tesla is becoming, and the potential it has. Then when you buy more shares you won‚Äôt sell them at a single trillion dollar market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 02:00:54'] >Not sure if this is the correct forum for this discussion, but how do you all avoid FOMO from such huge rallies?Same as always: Make a thesis and stick with it as long as it holds true.My thesis at the time was: Elon having fun with Twitter or the macro-enviroment (which caused the stock to come down) had nothin to do with Tesla fundamentals. So I waited until the Twitter drama wasn't frontline news anymore for a couple days and bought more.My overall thesis on Tesla is 10 years+. I'll get out when their *energy* business segment starts to flatten out...and only under the assumption that neither FSD nor robotaxi nor Teslabot or anything else they come up with in the lab pans out. If *any one* of those takes off I will have to reevaluate my exit strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 03:24:30'] You made your profit and you did great things with it. One thing you can‚Äôt do it regret taking profit. I have cashed out on stocks when I hit my number and did the right thing with the profits. I could have had a lot more but I always remember that I could have lost my money. Ensuring you don‚Äôt regret profit will help against the fomo you are feeling. You did great! That‚Äôs all you need to think about
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 02:49:55'] Why not just buy a little for fun without margin? That way you still get to enjoy the ride up a little but aren‚Äôt impacted too much if it goes sour
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 04:31:52'] Take your win as that‚Ä¶a win. You could jump back in and make profit or you could lose money. Some people hit the jackpot at the casino and never win big again. Look at the improvements you made from your approach and enjoy it. A great investor knows their luck is just that sometimes. No need to get greedy and reverse the progress you made. Now make smart long-term investments to grow your nest egg.Don‚Äôt look at it as FOMO. You did it right.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 05:53:31'] I wouldn‚Äôt hang onto the feeling too long. It can cause madness. Just forget about it. I bought a decent amount of Tesla between 300-350/share in 2021/2022 and have been negative on it for a while. But i bought a bigger amount in early 2020. My point is that you can never know for sure what the stock will do and when. It‚Äôs best to just buy and hold, imo at least. Dollar cost average in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 07:09:41'] >Is this normal? How do you all avoid this feeling?This is no different than learning to handle any other form of anxiety. According to cognitive behavioral therapy, thoughts lead to feelings which lead to actions or coping mechanisms. Most of the time these feelings and their following actions are irrational. It's impossible to control your thoughts but if you practice recognizing them in the moment, challenging them with logic, and just letting them drift away on a cloud, then you can calm your emotions and not feel the need to take actions.In this instance, you didn't get in to Tesla at what some would consider the right time. So what? There are going to be more opportunities in the future. FOMO'ing into it now may or may not be the right action.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-22 15:34:44'] Yeah, it happens literally all the time.  The best way to handle it, imo, is to develop a set of rules or policies and just continually adjust them based on your experience.  For example, in my retirement account, no stock can be more than 2% so I have had to let go of some winners but I‚Äôve also avoided some losses, too.  In my trading account, I might tell myself to set a more aggressive target next time, etc.  But I don‚Äôt make much at all active trading so I like using the risk mitigation strategy, even if it means selling winners, for any kind of serious money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 10:15:32'] Look at the stock price over max time. It has a unique pattern. I‚Äôm pretty sure it will go down again. I don‚Äôt know if it will go down lower than its last low, though. Last time it dropped, it didn‚Äôt, after having done so a few cycles. I bought 5 shares at $135 earlier this year. Watched it rally, then drop, then bought 30 more at $160. I would still like some more but I‚Äôm waiting until it drops to $180. If they miss earnings they will tank.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 10:24:45'] Dude I bought TSLA a long time ago and I've been selling off half at a time pulling profit. I still have a good amount but if i sat on it I'd have a good bit of money right now that could seriously help my family. But there was no way to know how hard it'd climb. I captured profit and did things with it. Could have lost everything waiting for the home run payout. Things are complicated by the fact that Tesla is a meme stock. They have a solid foundational business combined with Elon Musk doing everything he can to sabotage the people actually doing worthwhile work. It's even harder to analyze true value and anticipate whether he crashes the company doing whatever fool thing is in his head tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 10:15:03'] Focus instead on what you can do something about, rather than what you can't.  You can't time travel and buy before the trip and sell before the dip. Instead just try to identify good ideas for the future...

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 11:03:09'] The prospect theory says that investors value gains and losses differently, placing more weight on perceived gains versus perceived losses. An investor presented with a choice, both equal, will choose the one presented in terms of potential gains. Prospect theory is also known as the loss-aversion theory.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-21 11:06:35'] You can't. That's why someone invented the phrase "Hindsight is 20/20." Wait until the feeling passes and that's all you can do. Kicking yourself is part of following the stock market. I bought a few NVDA shares at $132 and I sold some last Thursday at $433, only to see the price keep going up this week.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-22 11:18:24'] You got lucky on your TSLA trade because it appears as if you don't have a system that tells you when to get in and when to get out. I also trade TSLA, but use a system set on auto so I don't have to think about what to do. My system got in in at 168 (so your 160 was a very good entry point), but, I am still long.

When they hit the low earlier this year I bought a whole bunch, and waited for them to recover, and they seemed to have no end in sight and all the other car companies seems to be catching up, with rivian and the electric hummer and F150 getting rave reviews and hype, along with their solar business seemingly forgotten, i though ok, Tesla isn‚Äôt going to reverse course anytime soon and sold the last one a week ago.

Other than that Tesla cars appeal to a very small niche of customers. A lot of people are still brand loyal to other auto makers especially Ford and GM. Plus with Tesla still ignoring NTSB requests and with how their cows remain poorly made and expensive. I think Tesla will drop off in the coming years especially as other auto makers release their EV fleets.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 13:05:09'] Damn that's insane, I was debating buy this when it was at $410 back in November and I remember a lot of people on here telling me not to do it if they were me lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 14:12:07'] Can't wait for Tesla to hit one quadrillion valuation just as the last power plant on the planet is salvaged for metal siding panels.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 12:59:44'] Will keep saying it, and possibly continue to be wrong, but I would be terrified to own this stock and I worry for those who do at valuations like this. TSLA could easily drop 80-90% and from what I've seen a lot of TSLA investors seem to weight their portfolios heavily in TSLA and various EV-adjacent stocks.Congrats to everyone who owns the stock though - especially if you got in around the time of the split. Just make sure you can weather the less optimistic times which are sure to come sooner or later. Half of investing is holding stocks when they go up, the other half is making sure to get out before they go to zero - which with enough time, they all eventually do.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 16:18:56'] I remember when it dropped back into the $500s. Told myself it would be a great opportunity. Forgot. Would've dropped like $35k in. Fuck me.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 01:56:54'] I like Tesla but its valuation is out there where it needs for everyone to buy Tesla products at the scale of apple almost. Its limited by the big tech companies on the list because if it surpasses those then its a full blown bubble stock at that point so its risk and rewards aren't as attractive where I can just own Apple or any of the other big tech and some are reasonable in valuation too. You might as well own SPY instead of Tesla. Perfect example of "I like the company but not the stock".
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 02:37:49'] I really don't get it is it all just the cult of personality or are people seeing tesla stocks as an extension of his other companies

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 02:55:52'] Tesla sells electricity to its users which most of their customer bases uses exclusively which no other electric manufacturer can claim. Reliability of their charging network and software prowess is the reason why tesla is what it is. They are a software company that happens to make cars

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 06:07:54'] If you previously lost $6000 on tesla in 2020, but in 2021 you are up $6000, does the loss and gain even out? Or since the $6000 you gained is taxed, will you then need to make $12,000 pre-tax?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 06:22:19'] I think this is just a mini-tech bubble because interest rates are low.  While Tesla may never crash 80% like a 2000 stock, it's going to definitely crash, once QE slows and interest rises.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 03:32:20'] As long as TSLA continues to innovate and grow the valuations may not catch up for many more years, but one needs to have a plan if the fundamentals that got the price here changes.  Keep in mind valuations can catch up when the price drops to meet it.   Money moves fast  so have a strategy while enjoying the ride.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 22:11:37'] Sometimes I wish a crash would come just so all the delusional investors get a reality check. Tesla going higher and higher doesn't mean it's not overvalued or that fundamentals doesn't matter anymore. Same shit was said before every bubble burst, like Amazon went from $106 to $6/Intel from \~$70 to $13 after the dotcom bubble burst. The sad part is that people who are in green with Tesla will probably still get burned when the price will go to dust.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 07:00:11'] I have recently gained the investment thesis that the market is never ‚Äúovervalued,‚Äù rather it is what it is. There are catalysts that drive the price down 10-20% equating to a correction but that usually doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the fundamentals or technicals. The market will continue to be valued at where it‚Äôs valued as long as the market is an auction-based market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 07:30:28'] Tesla did not ‚Äúbreeze‚Äù to this valuation. This latest bump is all about Hertz‚Äôs recent buy of 100k units. The impact goes beyond that massive direct sale though. There‚Äôs a saying in the car sales biz: ‚ÄúThe feel of the wheel seals the deal.‚Äù Hertz, by and large, serves an upper income clientele, the same people who can afford Tesla automobiles. Since they divested their showrooms, Tesla has to have been ‚Äúwalking some sales‚Äù to customers who cannot fathom buying a car without driving in first.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 13:13:37'] I don't believe anyone would buy at this price. When the big whales sell, there will be a lot of bag holders crying and saying Tesla is the best and so on.Remember fo somebody to win, someone else must lose and that can be you

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 04:49:19'] The mother of all bubbles....
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 20:46:30'] Everything these days are idiotic and it's because of runaway money printing. Valuations are ridiculous for everything from stocks, to housing, to doge coins. Tax paying no longer matters because the government can simply print more money when they run out. Who is dumb enough to buy treasury bonds when you know 10 years later they hold half the value and pay shit in dividends. So people are taking more risk to buy stocks and who cares if it's a company that generates 1/10th the revenue but have 10x the market cap. Stocks are now valued based on popularity or something else. Cryptocurrencies are idiotic as well. They're only used as a mean for the rich to hedge the money they conned off of the middle and lower class. There is no incentives for the average person to be miners because your chance of being awarded a bitcoin or any coin is practically 0. So much for decentralizing money. The mining rigs consume more energy than two refrigerators and loud  AF. It's expensive as hell to buy and if you get fished or forgot your password or broke your wallet, it is lost to the ether. An idiotic way to hedge inflation but there's fewer alternatives. Then you have a fundamental investor like Warren Buffet saying gold, which has been used for millenniums, has little use. Then you have over priced housing thanks to Trump unemployment money. A $300 grand house get you a new home with basic cheap everything. Then they drive up the demand because investors are just putting down 5% on a house and buying 5 of them to rent out. F the idiotic money printing. F the idiocy in the world. It's just people conning other people to get rich.
