POST: ['2023-05-02 16:54:47'] POST TITLE: b'Help: what do I do with AMZN?'
POST_TEXT: b'I have a lot of AMZN that was acquired prior to the downfall (at ~$150). Mistakes were made and I am still holding them.\n\nI dont need the money right now, but I still perceive a lot of risk in continue to hold that many stocks from 1 single company.\n\nWhat is the general sentiment around AMZN stock at the moment? Is everybody on a similar boat, holding the bag in hopes it comes back up? Or have you lowered your expectations already and not expect it to go back to high $150s level ever again?\n\nI dont expect it to ever go back to $150 levels honestly, so I am just thinking should I sell now and avoid it going down even further? Or do we have hopes it hits at least $115 or $120 so the loss is not so big?\n\nSorry for such an open ended question, but hope you can chime in with your perspectives please. Thanks!'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 01:02:25'] Let's say your AMZN stock is now worth 10K. If you were given 10K today would you invest it all in AMZN? Or would you put your money elsewhere expecting more growth? Be rational about it. Also like others said: we're heading towards recession and everything is going shit, so not likely that other companies will do a whole lot better. Could hold it as cash for a while or put in HYSA while the market keeps going down, but the thing is no one knows when it goes up again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 22:32:39'] Sell covered calls on your shares. Sell two weeks out at 10% more than current price. You will make income until they get called away. You lock up a 10% gain plus the premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 03:23:31']  I won't give any opinion on AMZN, that's up to you to decide, but I'm surprised no one has brought up the sunk cost fallacy.Right now, as it stands, you've lost money. We feel better knowing it's unrealized, but it doesn't change that you need a stock to appreciate in value just to be back even. Every day is an independent decision. If you think stock XYZ is going to do well but that AMZN won't then your dollar amount is better spent in XYZ. If you think AMZN will drop then it doesn't matter what any other stock will do, you're better off not in AMZN even if that means that money is idle.Booking a loss sucks, I'm not great at it either. But an unrealized loss is the same as a realized one for every purpose but taxes. If you don't like the risk/reward of something you should always change it to something better
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 19:21:03'] DCA into this position. In the next few months my total investment into AMZN will be roughly $22k with 200 shares being the goal. I’m underwater right now with 140 shares at $138 average. I plan on never selling.I’ve done a few financial research papers on the company in my graduate program which reaffirmed my conviction. Bezos started the company with the thesis to continue expanding into new ventures. They have never veered from this, always reinvesting into new projects and expansions. Over $500 billion in revenue and basically paid no tax. Don’t let the wonky numbers like PE and return on invested capital fool you. They prioritize growing and expanding over shareholder returns. This has always been the mindset. Keep in mind they started as an online bookstore in 1994, look at how big they are now.If Amazon was solely AWS, the price your paying now for the stock is probably worth it. They are in advertising, obviously deliveries through e-commerce, they own Ring, Whole Foods, Twitch, and many more, do a google search and you will be surprised at the companies they own. They are also in solar. Not to mention robotics that will eventually be used in their warehouses.One of, if not the best companies to own for the future. That’s just my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 19:16:35'] We have a sizable amount of AMZN RSU vesting over the next 2 years. At current value it makes up about a bit less than 1/3 of our portfolio. Ofc our portfolio will grow in 2 years but I do plan on holding a large portion of the company. It sucks that the value has dropped but I don’t look at it like that. I look at it as present day what company is best to hold X portion of my money in. I honestly think Amazon is a solid company and will have solid returns from today over the next 10 years. I won’t mind having around 10-15% of my portfolio in amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 18:54:14'] Hold. No reason to think it can’t reach $150 again. It will. Maybe in several months or maybe a couple of years. Don’t believe me? Look at Netflix Nvidia and Meta charts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 03:46:00'] I bought under 100.  Im not selling a single share until it gets to 150.  It's been a really tough year so don't get too down.  Look back at some point and see if you would have done somethings differently.  Don't be too hard on yourself.We all lose money in the market, learn from mistakes.  Unlike many people here, I'd look at what it will do six months from now and decide if you want to sell for a loss.  Im not sure how fast it will return to 150.  But Im pretty damned sure it will.  And if you sell you've lost your money, pure and simple.  And where will you put it afterwards?All the best.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 05:50:31'] Coincidentally as of today I allocated my stocks so that my holding in Amazon went from 40% to 80% of my total stocks, at an average cost of 102. I'm just too bullish on this stock. They are dominating the cloud computing space. They might have had less growth than Azure for one quarter year one year but over the bigger picture AWS overtook Azure long ago and is way ahead. In 2017 Azure made 28 billion dollars revenue while AWS was making 17 billion. Now Azure is at 60 while AWS is at 80 billion. When I hear experts talking about cloud computing they all say this is just the start. Demand for the cloud computing services are sticky as it takes years to make a switch from one provider to another. So there is not much risk in AWS's market being eaten by competitors.Advertising is generating over 40 billion dollars a year. And it's growing much faster than meta and google. It's even higher margin than AWS.Robotics within logistics. Fed-ex has admitted they are way behind Amazon on automation. I don't know they fine details but the difference must be big to admit it like that. And I want a portion of that when these ventures start making a profit. Their international business is just starting. They are the go to large retailer within India. India is the largest country population wise. India went from 15% middle class to 30% middle class in 10 years. If they can add another 15% to that in the next 15 years. That means more potential customers than the entirety of the United States. Of course they wont have as much money but the potential growth is enormous. I'm not even talking about countries where they already have operations running. Many people like to point out it's not profitable yet. But neither was Amazon US for the first 10 years. Many countries that they operate within have less favorable conditions than the United states. So profitability may take 15 years. There are only 5 countries where they have been operating for longer than 15 years. Germany, UK, France, Japan and China. That means the other 16 countries still need time to become profitable. Countries like Italy, Span, Brazil, India, Mexico, Australia, Turkey.For me at these prices it's nearly a no brainer. Of course Amazon has to execute properly. But I'm not doubting the competence of management. They had a great last quarter showing that  they still have their margins under controle for their other businesses. AWS decreasing in growth is the last thing I'm worrying about and is very explainable due to this macro environment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 18:27:07'] Sell and re-enter later. There’s way more potential for more downside than upsize right now.AMZN isn’t going anywhere but the market is stupid right now and not responding to serious economic troubles.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 00:09:10'] Hold. I don’t think Amazon is going out of business. It will likely gain higher than your entry point. It might take a while. The stock market might be a dumpster fire for a while. I believe that whoever holds the longest will be rewarded. If you want to sell, maybe sell just a fraction. I would hold it though. It will be tempting because it might go lower. I bought at $95 and am expecting it to go red for a while if the promised recession comes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 06:13:27'] I hold AMZN and DCA to add more…. They are an innovative business with a track record of providing services that make users choose them (I could buy on Walmart… I choose amazon.  I could use Google cloud, but more than likely to choose AWS…)I found personally that I can’t handle more than a few hand picked stocks, so do something like 60% VOO, 38% hand picked , 2% high risk…In total I have 8 hands picked stocks, all in a sector I know well… I find this is still too much and likely to trim back down to ~6? Hand picking stocks isn’t for everyone, and is a time commitment (you need to follow to know if your thesis ever changes).TL;DR - I hold AMZN, but if hand picked stocks isn’t for you, moving to an index fund may be worth it for mental health
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 06:29:00'] Why would you think Amazon won't reach $150 again? Didn't you buy with the expectation they would be worth $200, $300, etc over a period of 3-5 years? Figure out why you bought in the first place, has your reason for investing changed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 06:47:05'] It was $150 less than 12 months ago.   Ask yourself: what changed since then to bring the price down?   In my opinion it's a general malaise in the Tech sector, and less enthusiasm about the near term growth prospects of AWS with companies cutting back whilst inflation is biting.   Are those factors likely to go away within your 5 year window?   I would argue: absolutely. We can see that inflation is going down. We can also see a potential recession on the horizon which might hurt the share price even more in 2023 and maybe 2024. But beyond that it is still a humongous force in the Retail space, and is one of the primary players in the Cloud computing space as well. They're perfectly poised to do well once the economy picks up again.   If you don't need to sell, I'd definitely hold for at least a couple of years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 06:48:01'] It has been a rough 5 years for Amazon shareholders. I bought in in 2015 and added during the Covid drop, but overall the shares are flat since 2018. I am not sure either if I want to stay in or move on. The company seems to have a PR problem with the new management. Bezos was great at pumping up the stock and Jassy and his team is just the opposite, as we saw during the last ER. I am going to let the rest of the year play out. Their last quarter was good and the guidance was solid. AWS' slowdown spooked the market. If the next few quarters do show a meaningful slowdown in AWS, it may be time to sell. It's a great company and I use Amazon services all the time, but that doesn't make it a great investment anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 06:52:09'] Buy
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 06:54:46'] sell half and diversify into another company in the cloud business, e.g. Google/MicrosoftYes, Amazon could go back up, but so could Google, or Microsoft could go higher, etc. so you're not throwing away potential future gains.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 07:24:31'] What percentage of your portfolio is AMZN? Amazon is/could be a great stock to hold long term. (I think they should rot in hell, but that's just me.) What I try to tell myself is two-fold,1. Where would you put that money if it weren't in AMZN? Do you have a better option right now? (Usually feeling a way about losses is impatience. Are you being impatient? Are you chasing gains?)2. Can you switch focus and invest in other tickers so that your AMZN position becomes a smaller percentage of your entire portfolio?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 07:28:18'] They’re blue chip. Hold them long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 07:37:41'] I’d hold but if you are unsure and want to potentially gain extra cash to put else where you can sell calls on some of it depending how many shares you have. Just know if you sell below your cost basis if it gets called away you will lose the money. Only do this if you do not think it will drop hard and are okay will selling at the strike with a little extra cash. I personally sell leaps on a portion of mine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 21:08:47'] AMZN may not go anywhere, but it's valuation may not recover quickly due to their high P/E ratio.  The stock popped briefly after earnings before dropping during the conference call when the company communicated that the rate of AWS growth was slowing.  As a result, the company cannot justify their P/E ratio which puts downward pressure on the stock.  If Amazon drops to a 20 P/E like the rest of the stock market, the stock could drop significantly from current levels and easily could be worth only $20-$40 per share.

Now stock is up another 26%.\n\nAmazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.\n\nCan someone help me understand how NVDA has such a low short interest at these level? And literally everyone thinks this all makes sense? (Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 03:15:16'] It's just dumb to short NVDA because at best it's a great company that's overvalued. TSLA was literally going bankrupt a few years back, so it's not really a fair comparison.And while I'd argue it's massively overvalued relative to other tech valuations, it's probably not that overvalued if you believe they can achieve 50% growth rates for several years while maintaining 30-40% net profit margins. In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.I think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.Personally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price. With lots of companies now beginning to build their own AI-optimised chips I worry whether NVDA can defend their margins. If they execute well I think they probably can, but when you have a stretched valuation that's not really good enough.

Enterprise/dev tools, GeForce Now etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 23:42:20'] Keep in mind Amazon is a garbage e-retailer. E-retailers have 1% margins, so that revenue sounds impressive but Amazon essentially makes no profit from any of it that came from selling things on Amazon. The cloud business is basically the only thing worth anything, and that’s getting to be a crowded space. You can no longer assume 60% compounded annually there. I honestly have no idea why amazon trades at the lofty levels it does.

Again, I wouldn’t touch the stock now coz I don’t own it and it’s super expensive to buy, but hey these big fund managers have been buying NVDA for ages and I bet their avg cost is less than 100 bucks, would they want to sell now?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-12 06:47:24'] I for one own 100 shares and just wrote 2 contracts for 85p on April 6. What does this mean? I took advantage or am hoping to take advantage of the pessimism and negative price movement on Amazon. I sold these contracts for $130 credit each, thus I received $260 to leverage 17,000 to Amazon until April 6. This is ~1.5% return on investment should Amazon not be under $85 on April 6.If Amazon goes under $85 then on April 6 I will be buying 200 shares for $85. However, if I subtract the $260 credit I got, it’s like I’m getting the shares for $83.70. Why am I doing this risk, I’m already comfortable holding shares here in the low 90s but I’ll gladly take more if it falls to 85. I’ll just decide to take some credit now instead of holding onto my money because I still think it won’t get that low.All of this to tell you just hold those 5 shares you have. Sure, it could drop another 7-10 and you may lose another $35-50 but Amazon is a longer term play. I’d look at it as a solid play in an account which may average around 5-10% per year gain but you could make some extra if you’re savvy writing options if you have enough $

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-12 05:53:47'] I was early on AMZN stock.  As in back before anyone had it or thought it would be viable.  Also had business relationship that meant direct contact with Bezos staff.  Lots of product to and from.  Told many people of it.  Well, I saw standards slipping a decade ago and gradually scaled completely away probably 5-6 years ago.  In recent years, customers are noticing the cracks and problems.  It's now an ad-laden, unusable flea market for counterfeit and offshore suppliers.  Delivery and customer service standards have imploded.  It's been forever since I heard a consumer-based positive, and it seems there's just one negative story after another.  I think pandemic spared and slowed their decline, but they're back on that same trajectoryPeople used to check out products locally and then order from Amazon.  That has almost flipped.  Businesses used to fear Amazon announcing a move into their space.  Now, they almost welcome it, because they'll be able to show how they're doing it better than bad big Amazon.  All of that said, the counter case is that most of the big bombed out stocks that have had huge rallies in the last year have had similar horrible narratives and sick prognoses.  So maybe AMZN will copy what's happened with NVDA, TSLA, META, CRM, NFLX.  All of those were considered walking dead, and frankly none of them has actually made any kind of significant change or announcement to deserve their 60 to 100+% rebounds.  These names and others just had to string two or even one tempting tale and the bulls took it from there.  Netflix "customers hate us but now we're going to sell ads and don't look too closely at our plans because we have none and oops we had to refund the advertisers and next our plan to to bug our customers and call them thieves"Tesla - our pathological owner maybe be getting more pascistic by the day, but he now says he's going to stop dumping stock (maybe) and we're slashing prices because we're the only car company somehow building up inventory right now."Nvidia - we can't gouge on the price of our videogame chips by calling them crypppt products anymore, so now we'll call them AI chips.Meta - we'll stop talking about our silly avatar world vision so much, and we'll fire a bunch of the people who had nothing to do with it.  And so on.  So all AMZN really needs to do is say one or two things the market wants to hear.  They don't even have to be necessarily great or even true.  Announce big layoffs or say they're cutting back on lord of the rings spending, maybe announce a new CEO that's not like an NPC.  Say they're turning delivery logistics over to AI.  Or possibly the biggest thing, say they're segmenting the Chinese/counterfeit goods off to a separate website and "consulting" with Bezos to bring the web store back to something more trustworthy and customer friendly.  The stock wouldn't even wait for them to actually do these things.  Just the whiff of them maybe happening would spark it up.  Even just someone there admitting they've lost their their way and that the pizza tastes like cardboard, that alone could revive the stock.

Don't buy anything you wouldn't want to own forever and just hold it unless it really doesn't make sense anymore. Amazon is a massive company with growth prospects. I doubt you lose money on that position if you just wait. I have a couple positions that I'm down like 80% on right now and I'm still just holding them because I think it can come back eventually. Individual stocks are volatile. If it bothers you to look at that, maybe go index funds and just hold them until retirement.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 14:26:33'] Look at the PE ratio. EPS was 0.28. If you extrapolate this for a year, your at 1.12. Current price after the fall is 94. That’s still a PE over 90. Those types of PEs are for high growth companies expecting to blow up I. Revenue and profit. How much bigger do you really think Amazon can get? Compare to Apple with a PE of 24 and a EPS of 6. This stock has always had a pie in the sky price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 13:46:47'] I don’t hold Amazon but I just want to ask: has anyone else noticed a drop in product quality from them? I used to order a lot of stuff (even things I’d consume like whey protein), but wound up cancelling Prime a year ago over concern of counterfeit products. Can’t even do your own DD on what you’re buying a lot of the time since Amazon seems plagued with fake reviews.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 13:45:39'] Seems like an overreaction, dont hold too much amazon but still believes in them. But tbh these earning crashes are necessary if we want to come out of inflation issue soon, cant have both outperformance AND low inflation, just doesnt happen
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 13:51:28'] Everyone talking about how Amazon isn’t going anyway so a drop shouldn’t happen.  Why aren’t you also demanding VZ or JNJ or PG have P/E ratios of 100?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 06:16:44'] I mean Amazon was already overvalued, it had like a 60 PE after already conquering the online retail and cloud market. A non-growth company typically has a PE around 10.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 06:44:08'] HOG - Harley-Davidson reported interesting numbers in that their shipments are up as a whole across 2022 from 2021... but behind the curtain we see the real truth. The reason for my post is that motorcycles are a luxury item for most and Harley is one of the most expensive based on cost of entry.     Inventory at dealers rose by thirteen thousand units from the same time in 2021 after they had spent years trying to knock down those numbers. Sales in the US are down nearly nine thousand units. HDFS, their financial services arm, set aside 51m in Q4 for losses which brought 2022 up to 145m in total.  For a brand whose point of entry is over sixteen thousand and typically is in the high twenty thousand range these are continuing to be not good signs. Sales is not be helped by the fact they are continuing their supply chain surcharge which is a thousand or more on their most popular units.  https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news/news-details/2023/Harley-Davidson-Delivers-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results-Successfully-Completing-Second-Year-of-Hardwire-Strategic-Plan/default.aspx   https://s201.q4cdn.com/697889289/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/HOG-Q4-YE-2022-Earnings-Slides-2.02.23-FINAL.pdf      I have no position in their stock, I am just a former owner of their motorcycles and likely a future customer should they choose to remove the surcharge. Dealers are going to be struggling this year and seeing sales decline in the US yet again while inventories are up will put pressure on the dealer network even more.   Oh, on top of all that they will be importing a motorcycle (X350) designed and built in China with only their emblem added to the bike for their riding academy. Harley is no longer able to economically produce bikes they can use for their own riding academy

POST_TEXT: b'# HISTORY:\n\nThe story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZNs IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself wouldve been an impressive feat but it wouldnt be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 10:46:21'] Nice work! I’m curious why you chose to use the 10y treasury note rate as the risk free rate instead of treasury bills. The 10y T-note is not risk free as it bears interest rate risk. 3 month Tbill should be used as that’s virtually risk free. This is the way it’s done in textbooks. So, using the tbill 4.5% rate, your risk premium would be 5.04%, your coe would be 11.2%, and your wacc would be 9.2%. Not a big difference tbf but noteworthy nonetheless
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 02:34:28'] Two things.First. You expect me to read all of this? Seriously? It's all over the place and includes a lot of fluff. In addition, Amazon's financials are very consolidated and don't provide much value at a deep level. Unless you have access to management and spend a lot of time following them and building up financial models over years, there really isn't much that can be done at a detailed level. And I personally wouldn't spend the time to build up detailed financials myself on a company like this because you could probably get 80% of what you need to know about valuation with some very high level assumptions and cursory look at their financial metrics over time. (This isn't the case for all companies however.)Second. $115 vs $85 is a terrible margin of safety on a company like Amazon. Especially in a rising rate environment and the significant risks that you are missing. I would personally want something above 2x to consider betting on the company in this environment. As you get older you'll realize that Amazon isn't really cheap right now and there are probably a lot better plays. Probably someplace in MicroCaps where you can get an advantage and actually understand the components of the business at a more detailed level. It would require a good amount of research, but the exercise would probably be more valuable and illuminating than trying to roll the dice on consolidated financials on a company as large as this one with so many moving pieces and conflicting priorities.In addition, while you write a lot of stuff on here, you don't really understand their strategy or the major issues facing the company. While it is nice to analyze the financials, I think you need to spend more time learning about the business and other business disciplines. Because a lot of the "analysis" is cutting and pasting quotes from management. Many of which aren't really that critical and don't tell you much about the organization.Good luck on your journey.

So I was curious to see how much of the gains can be attributed to the big 6 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, GOOG, META). I did a calculation were these 6 tech stocks had 0% gains this year. Based on my calculations (which could be wrong) these 6 stocks alone have contributed approximately 327 points to the S&P500 this year! If these 6 stocks had no gains this year, then the S&P 500 would be at approximately 3823, which interestingly is the same price the S&P 500 was at the beginning of the year (3824). This is all based on yesterday's data and might not have been calculated correctly. In the same time the S&P500 equal weight index was negative YTD (-1.00%) yesterday.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 13:59:32'] Today  I added to BTU, AMR, a micro-cap, and sold some AMD. Commodities are wrecking a lot of people it seems, but it is a risky category. One day I'd like to share the story about this microcap because the amount of incredible DD and the story of how government officials/IR are accidentally leaking very very material information is just so entertaining. If the stock quintuples like there's a reasonable chance of happening, I'll be happy to tell the tale.Why has BTU been so disappointing? They have so much cash, like $1.8B right? That's about half their market cap. Well they completed their surety negotiations (surety referring to the fact that all coal companies have to post collateral for future 'reclamation' of the land) and other debt covenants were cleared. Problem is some $900M is required as collateral going forward, $500M has to be posted as liquidity requirement, and the management is choosing to hold onto another $400M for their own conservative cash management. So suddenly the amount of available cash is not so high. So the buybacks have to come from high FCF going forward, which requires thermal pricing not to melt down. Now I think at today's prices it is a good deal, but... so are other coal names. Had so much cash not been tied up, sure, it would have been an easy double, to $35-40 a share. But the imminent catalyst is really much less exciting. Long term holders will likely see excellent returns in all coal names, but right now, with thermal pricing going down the drain, being optimistic is difficult. At least their small buyback (5-7% of float a quarter?) will be able to suck up even more shares. There are some technicalities about convertible debt but tbh I don't fully understand it. Some credit experts on Twitter are saying BTU is never going to get favorable terms on that to be able to take it out.I'm not adding a lot of BTU, as I have a comfortable sized position--enough that I don't really care if it keeps falling. AMR I have a very large position but at a cost basis I'm very happy with (148). I'm willing to hold AMR for 2-3 years no matter what. I would care if AMR falls another 20% from here though...

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 11:17:50'] How does this ever stop/ pullback? It can't even go more than 50 cents without the V taking it right back up. It seems the real strength is not the extreme rally in QQQ, but the fact that there is a V protecting every drop. Even the days where it's red, it's maybe $2, but the green days are massive. Since  March 13th there has only been 1 day where QQQ fell by more than $5 in a day while today is the 10th day where this is up by $5 or more. I've seen many crazy rallies over the years, but there would always be a pullback/retrace to the mean, but you have '23 where this simply isn't allowed to have normal pullbacks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 09:23:11'] Google.I don't like the direction Amazon retail is headed.  It's starting to feel like eBay when it was at the top just before decline.  Lots of cheap products by cheap resellers with counterfeiting issues.  It's opening the door to competition because the mote is drying up.I saw on the side of Amazon delivery trucks recently "Cheap Prices, Fast Delivery.  Pick 2."   If you're in the know about the triangle, it's "Speed, Cost, Quality. Pick 2".   It's apparent that Amazon is not focused on quality with their retail operations and it's hurting their reputation.2-day prime delivery.   Of the last 5 products I ordered on Amazon, only one got to me on time from their promised date.  1 never showed up at all, 1 took a full week before it was shipped and took another 5 days to get to me.  The other two were a day late.  I understand the delivery promise is from the date of shipping, not the date of order.  Again, reputation.  Amazon has become the last place I look when shopping now.Now, retail is NOT where Amazon makes its profits, but AWS has some strong competition with Azure and other cloud compute hosting solutions.  Google is also in this space and growing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 22:17:28'] Googl. Amazon’s ecommerce branch seems to be a bottomless moneypit that kills the profitability of the company as a whole, and with so much competition, I don’t know that that will ever change. And if they keep buying other businesses (roomba and one medical were both done in recent months), the government may have to break them up. And if that happens, then my answer to this question will be AWS.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 22:11:48'] I like Google more because they don’t have the retail part holding it back. Search is a monopoly and I think YouTube is even more unassailable than even search. I think Google has the opportunity to really take the reigns as the single most important tech firm but they don’t seem to be doing that now, which is disappointing. I think Microsoft is much more aggressive. Here’s to Google claiming their rightful spot as the best tech company in the world.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 19:16:34'] I personally am invested in Goog but having second thoughts as I think company is poorly run.  Many of their big projects have failed and lots of their software is crap ( chrome book for instance).

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 21:26:13'] I think I like Google more, most of their products I have used really just blow the competition out of the water. Only thing looming over them is this antitrust thing in congress with their ad business idk the current status of that though or the impact it will have but could be pretty volatile with that stuff going on.  Antitrust thing might effect Amazon also. Amazon is a great company, but I don’t feel the same way about their products.  Lots of their stuff is fine, Amazon shopping is a great product, but everything else is just ok imo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 20:31:58'] Probably GOOGL, as far as I know, we are heading into technological age and they are top tier tech company with multiple solid products and pure domination over specific sections of IT, with plenty of room to go elsewhere.   * Youtube - basically a monopoly over online video content, much more potential for the future, could replace cable TV, they expanded into streaming by signing and literally buying off streamers from competition, introducing marketplace and so on.* Search - Still a monopoly, there is no one else getting even close. * Android - Not sure how could they monetize it, but controlling the biggest mobile OS in the world is something. * Storage, online office, chrome, so much to offer.&#x200B;Amazon does their web services really well which brings them a lot of money right, but if Google decides to go heavy on the web services, they could take over that part of the business.  Amazon is here to stay but you could see that competition has it easier in that section, if China wasnt cucked, BABA could have been really big. Coupang dominates Korea etc, so even though amazon dominates their space, it's not on the same level of domination as Google.   I would say, both are good companies and great investments, personally I can see GOOGL being there and dominating and taking over even different aspects of the Tech business in the future, if they keep the train going.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 19:25:10'] I have both but almost 2x more in AMZN.  First off, they're more expensive at around 120 PE vs goog 22 so know that going in.  For me, I feel like Amazon is more diversified with commerce, aws, advertising (which is very underrated), and now will dabble in healthcare and probably compete with FedEx and others soon.Goog is losing the smartphone battle for sure, and Amazon apple and meta will take more advertising share over time.  But they are probably the best position for real AI, and have some other bets like waymo, green tech, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 20:10:05'] Google. Amazon has real blood and sweat competition from other retailers like wal-mart. When is the last time someone that tried to compete with Google's data and search products was anything more than a meme?Sure Google isn't winning the smartphone war but you should also have been buying appl anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 03:20:09'] Easily AMZNGOOGL has so much potential but has serious execution issues. The amount of times they've demonstrated something groundbreaking but not followed up on it, like Google Glass and even Google Wallet. They like to boast how they had compatibility for smartphone payments years before Apple Pay but because they do everything so half-arsedly, they wait until Apple catches up and then redo everything. They've never found success with their smartphones despite their massive marketing budget. Google Cloud is way behind AWS and Azure. Waymo was leading edge but has been stagnant for 5 years - Tesla self-driving has now surpassed it. YouTube got way too complacent and are finally getting pressured by TikTok. Android markershare has been steadily decreasing and manufacturers are rarely profitable. Their only source of income is ads, which has low growth potential. They were getting eaten by Meta but got lucky last year after Apple's privacy changes shifted ad dollars from META to GOOGL. Now they're stagnant again whilst being pressured by TikTok and AMZN ads.AMZN does less things but does it well. AWS is market-leading and still growing. Amazon.com has no competition but is still growing. Prime memberships are increasing, delivery times are shortening. Their ad business is booming. Depsite GOOGL having more potential on paper, they have less growth prospects. This is reflected by both company's growth multiples

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 11:35:21'] Looks like the GOOG folks are getting the upvotes, so I’ll just throw out one negative to keep in mind:GOOG has a lot more regulatory uncertainty moving forward. Out of all the non-social tech companies, they’re the most likely to have antitrust issues. And, including the social companies, they’re the most likely to be broken up into pieces (Gmail vs search vs hosting vs AI). If you only like GOOG because they do all the things, and their R&D can improve all those operations, you are probably not evaluating this risk appropriately.Amazon, on the other hand, has a worst case regulatory uncertainty of having to pay workers more, which does not threaten their business model.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-20 22:08:52'] Why would you focus on a single position? Only reason would be to do something exotic like selling calls on hype days to buy back on fear days. No one posting here is going to become an activist voter. Barely even able to buy 100 shares for conventional call selling.Everyone is gangster until negative variance comes. Even positive variance is more dangerous than buffet admits because most people won’t be cool with holding while flat for 5-10 years even if it eventually runs again and ultimately outperforms in the long run. Even if the stock doubles in the next year or two, it’ll just embolden them to gamble harder like they’re geniuses. That’s why diversification is the free lunch. It’s better to slightly underperform and have steady gains than going crazy thinking your a genius or a fool over years of short to mid term noise.The way you feel about google and Amazon is how people used to feel about GE, AOL, yahoo, ibm, Enron, world com, Sears. Even you think you can handle positive variance like Microsoft and apple being flat for a decade while all the other old blue chips fade. Most people can’t and how will you know your holding the winner and not another about to go bust. Even runs like the dot com, the positive variance ended up breaking people. Do yourself a favor and hold at least 5-10 companies, preferably uncorrelated and different industries.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 06:54:27'] AWS dominates the work arena and Amazon is getting into every inch of people’s lives (bad and good) and offers cheaper options for everything that are functional. Google is known for horrible privacy practices. Does anyone still use Google to search consistently that knows anything about tech? Very few. Google is also laughable in user interface department compared to Apple and even Amazon. It’s a running joke they don’t hire UI specialists.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 02:59:53'] Moral concerns aside Amazon. Amazon isn’t going away and is eliminating more and more online competition. Google monetizes selling data but other companies sell similar services and make a profit the same way. A lot of projects google has started have quietly failed. Stadia, good buzz, google glass, and others. They also have a lot of litigations issues to deal with owning YouTube and removing content.Amazon has more room for growth with their streaming services and their aws is a lot of their profitability that isn’t going anywhere. Their biggest problem is they go through labor so fast. Their turnover is so high they will run out of unskilled labor in just a few years and are already rehiring people they let go.Now, if I consider morality into this equation it’s neither. Amazon churn and burns their workers and treats them like machines. Their union busting is notoriously aggressive. Bezos doesn’t have a philanthropic bone in his body and pays next to no taxes.Google has been doing the opposite of their “do no evil” philosophy for at least a decade, selling data of customers often and frequently with nebulous terms of service which they keep revising.This doesn’t include the increase I compliance with the government and surveillance of its customer base since 9-11. Or the fact that YouTube has brainwashed 30 to 40% of the country into believe falsehoods via their video recommendation software. They leave a lot of videos up until they are reported but their platform has promoted neo nazism, covid misinformation, conspiracy theories and more.Seriously, fuck both these companies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 03:32:01'] Amazon because it is a more diversified company. Googel is too much dependent on people offering their content for free. With ever-diminishing returns for content creators, I think youtube will slowly use traction. You can see it on the type of ads you get: most of them are either mobile games or investor courses. When was the last time you saw a regular brand advertise on YT?Amazon is mostly known for its store but the bulk of money comes from AWS. I think that will still grow, even if the store is faltering.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 03:43:17'] From a purely ethical and social responsibility perspective, Google is still the better choice.However, these characteristics tend to play out in the long run and company culture can change, while in the short term ruthlessness and questionable ethics can lead to being more profitable.

(Other rev types are negligible in comparison, same with Apple, they say they’re a software services business but they are the iPhone company. Without the iPhone no one can use any of their services so their TAM for software is <= iPhone users which means it pivots their whole business on the continued success of 1 product ie 1 trick pony again)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 08:22:31'] $AMZN hands down. AWS alone makes it worth it and you get the retail business and steaming for free.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 08:30:15'] Google for me. Sure they spend a lot of new projects, but if we hit a true recession they will be able to cut costs and stay profitable a lot easier than Amazon. It’s a much more resilient business, IMO. Also P/E is cheaper for Google right now. Only reason I’d buy Amazon is for its AWS business, which I think will also be a good bet long term, but they may see more turbulence than Google in the short term and they are a little higher on P/E, so you can probably wait for a pullback.

Both company's will in all likely hood make you money and number 2 and probably the biggest one was overhead. Amazon needs lots of warehouses and tons employees, so they spend a lot plus they are going to have to reckon with the whole union thing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 04:54:44'] They are both great but I’d go with GOOG. Their web search and YouTube are a monopoly. The biggest threat right now is antitrust issues. Ads will always be a big part of the web and no one else has the most like them not Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc. Humans will become more dependent on the internet and search will always be dominated by GOOG. Their other bets like AI, auto, cloud, etc. will continue to grow steadily. Finally, their PE is much more reasonable and Amazon’s retail division will likely be an albatross in the future unless they can spin it off to focus on their web business.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 06:25:27'] I am going to say Amazon long term, Google is safer short to mid term. Google has not been able to edge into other markets as well IMO and search engine dominance is slowly being eroded by other companies (Amazon Microsoft and TikTok (of all places)). Google is always playing catch-up outside of Search and AI (they clone or mimic what other companies do instead of innovating those things generally speaking). I agree with George Gilder that Google and Big Data in general will not achieve the goals they think are achievable with big data and their algorithms and data collection and everything they do will collapse in upon themselves in the future. Now if Google adapts to the next generation of computing before another company wins that space, and doesn't suck at innovating in that space,  Google is a safe long term. I don't see it personally, because building quantum computers is different than making them serve purposes for people to use.With Amazon, I see it being like the online Walmart for the marketplace of goods and groceries and for the Cloud, with hands in other things to have more opportunity to expand further successfully (whereas Google only succeeds where it's good historically). They will certainly have more overhead but they will become so good at sustaining through cycles of economy that like Walmart they will never run out of business.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 07:24:39'] Google. Only thing Amazon has of value (which is a lot of course) is AWS. The sooner they spin prime off as a separate company on for Prime to bankrupt itself the better. Prime won't exist by 2030.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 07:27:02'] Its close, but I would pick Google over Amazon.  Reasons being, Google is like the connector of information.  Its a super common word we use when we say we want to look for something.  Google has better perks for job employment, their innovation is right up there with Amazon.  Amazon does have a nice platform and people go to them to buy their stuff, they too have their technologies and dabble into all kinds of stuff..  Oh and the top reason.. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson   :D  " The Internship"  :D

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 07:43:19'] GOOG has a massive cash reserve right now so they could continue to grow at a ridiculous pace for many years to come, or they could start paying a dividend which would likely grow over time too.In 25 years, Google and Amazon could be the Coke and McDonalds of dividend kings so getting in early could mean an amazing income source by the time we're older and nearing retirement.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 09:32:37'] We recently bought a few shares of Google after the stock split.  I think they have a future, and I didn’t want anything to do with Bezos.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 09:39:07'] Amzn is my pick. The recent stock split is a strong sign of underlying strength and stability. Combine this with the educational adoption of AWS certifications for college credit and you’ll see a larger workforce with a preference for AWS tools.Sentiment seems to be swinging more and more towards technological privacy with GDPR and CCPA and will likely grow. This will dramatically impede Google’s main product: personal information and analytics.Of course, this is just my .02. Owning both is your best bet
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 09:54:50'] AWS is the most profitable cloud service in the tech sector.  Also Amazon has its hand in way more than tech.  They also have their own distribution service, and are the most customer focused company in the world.  So its a no brainer on Amazon.  I dont think Google will come close to the profits of Amazon over the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 10:08:15'] GOOG for me. If AMZN spins off AWS, I’d buy AWS too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 10:09:23'] Both!
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 10:10:14'] Amazon because of AWS, their ad business, and culture. Amazon’s management and leadership understand how to invest capital better than Alphabet. Alphabet is a fantastic company with a poor track record of spawning their own businesses. Amazon has more a culture of “let’s throw things against the wall and see what sticks,” versus Alphabet’s history of acquiring new businesses. I do not think any of Alphabet’s ‘moonshot’ projects have yielded anything at this point but I could be mistaken. Long term I would rather hold Amazon and just let them compound. I understand I am heavily biased as that is exactly what I have done. Full disclosure I have been an Amazon shareholder since 2003.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 10:15:11'] Let’s take their two biggest revenue streams: cloud services and advertising.  Forget about the rest for a second. For me it’s simple. If this was 2010, then I’d probably have said Googl . But today, Amazon AWS and Amazon Advertising have the share and the momentum
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 10:35:27'] AMZN is a monster machine. I've never had bad customer service from AMZN customer service with packages, returned, deliveries. They always try to at least help. As far as Google. I had a personal situation unfold in which I needed their assistance and they were SO COLD. Google was by far the worst and most frustrating experience I have ever dealt with in my life when it comes to communication / service.Also, many youtubers have complained about how distant and poorly YouTube (GOOGL) handles communication with their creators when it comes to demonetized videos. Although the same could be said for Twitch (AMZN) when it comes to streamer bans. So my reasoning is not based on numbers, ads, revenue, projections, growth etc. Purely anecdotal and biased.I'd choose AAPL or NVDA between all of the tech giants. AAPL held up the best out of all the tech stocks during bear market and has had the best rebound too. They have  premium products, great marketing, cult following and Warren Buffet backing if that means anything. Although they are near all time highs right now and many in the market are still very scared after this year's pullback. NVDA is doing well, they're still growing and have growth in revenue but they missed a projected earnings (they were too optimistic).  But at the same time their products improve substantially year over year. Also, crypto has been cooling down so NVDA has had a bit of a sell off which could be a buy the dip opportunity if you're looking at the long haul.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 10:44:53'] GOOG definitely. It's just too dominant in wayy too many different areas

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 11:05:27'] Amazon is an amazing business, but not an amazing stock to own presently right now. GOOG is just over 20 pe currently, and for a stock with that much growth potential, that much current profit being made and that solid of a balance sheet, is definitely a good buy imo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 11:06:20'] A look into the tea leaves. A good case study to look at the two companies is an example 1:1 product comparison. Let’s take Firebase vrs AWSAWS is huge, complicated, breaks all the time, but can scale almost indefinitely as long as you have the technical manpower to as well scale to support it. It is also slightly cheaper.  In order to accomplish this they cut corners and things like amplify just doesn’t do what is advertised.  Oh and AWS takes a very long time to deploy and as complication of your solution increases you get O(n^x) time to deploy.  Lastly, Marketing of AWS is top of the line. Firebase just works, has very few bugs and deploys very rapidly.  Costs slightly more, 20-30% but once you get past a certain limit scaling becomes more difficult.  Marketing of.firebase is not as good as AWS. And this is generally the experience across the product line of both companies.  (Also google is unmatched at the moment, perhaps with Next behind it in AI). Given this, what would you choose to invest your money in?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 11:39:32'] Everyone in comments is going to say to you GOOGL, so that's reason why you buy AMZN.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 12:11:22'] Google. Amazon still makes no money from the retail side of the business. Google is a cash machine and have a near monopoly in the search as well as other things. Even if they get split up the sum of YouTube and all the other businesses is more valuable than Amazon who is only profitable in the AWS. Just my take. Both are top tier companies but Amazon is already up 40% since the lows a few months ago and already is pricing in lots of growth in the future. I feel as though google is being underrated in growth potential meaning more room for gains. Can’t go wrong with both if you hold long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 12:21:43'] $goog AWS and Google (the search bar) are the two most important creations in modern technology (in my opinion). If I could separate AWS I would choose Amazon, but unfortunately you have to invest in all the other garbage which even if profitable, it just sucks to support Bezos and his worldwide network of treating employees like garbage. Also, YouTube is irreplaceable and GCP at least has a chance of gaining more market share.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-21 16:30:59'] Googl their business is more dynamic than Amazon.  Sure Amazon has been expanding, but Google does that constantly in tech. The big reason comes down to data and a lot more people use Google. This means ad revenue will always exists. Having all this data helps in research and development leading to further growth. Amazon is just retail mostly and not as dynamic. I just believe at one point earnings will be stagnant due to them being mostly retail.

I can say for sure personally that I have ordered 100 items a year for myself/work that were cheap enough there was NO WAY amazon made money delivering "for free" even if I paid for prime. Unsure if it's true but we as a whole have gotten spoiled with 2 day shipping..I remember a time when packages would show up on my door step so long after I had ordered them that I'd forgotten about them! It was like Christmas on a Tuesday in August!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 20:34:45'] I’d rather invest in companies that are based less on speculation and have a good track record of making good business decisions.  These businesses are trying to make money, but sometimes stuff happens out of their control, so you have to invest in a stock where you’re confident in where it’s heading.  Because once it goes down and never comes back up, you’ll obviously regret not doing your own due diligence and making your own decision based off what you can find online about the company. Because no one else is going to tell you.  Stuff always changes and you can’t always depend on others to make investment choices for you. IMO, I think it’s better that way since you can move freely without waiting on an ok from someone to sell/buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 03:24:22'] Bro, QQQ is all you need. It is heavily weighted with all these big tech stocks, and you will also get the advantage of overperformance by the smaller caps as they rise up the ranks (effectively automatically investing in the "next" Amazon as it appears).

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 21:13:22'] Amazon is a better business but Meta still has a good business model. People claiming Meta is dying are delusional. Meta owns 3 of the 4 largest social media apps on the planet and that won't change anytime soon. It will do fine. Meta will have much slower growth going foreward, however, Meta already has slowing growth priced in with a current price to fcf of 10x. Amazon likely has some growth left in it with AWS. AWS peak fcf per share was around $2.50 for a price to fcf at best of 45x. Amazon is a great company but a PE multiple of 45x is not reasonable for a company that size of Amazon. A PE between 25-30x is more appropriate.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 06:16:15'] what is your goal?  100% strict growth? just my personal thoughts, For disclaimer I own 200 shares of AMZN and I bought very near their 52 week low. but before going into details let me give my thoughts about META firstI don't think I will never own META in its current state. I think this recession has really shown some cracks in META's foundation.  While Zuck is trying hard for a pivot, that pivot is years away - look at current metaverse numbers actual numbers are not meeting predicted numbers.  That journey will be extremely expensive, and I am not sure it will catch on so that is a huge gamble.  I think while their user base is huge, I think their numbers of active users  has slowed. I joined the platform less than 2 years from releasing to the public, so I am a very long time users.  I have noticed that my news feed is showing less and less activity of my friends... when I check their profile, they haven't posted in a while... so I have taken the time to call a few of them and I get "yeah, kind of over the BS of FB." so with all the political crap, the censorship crap - a large slice of their users are over it.  So they are using FB to post memories or photos they want to keep... but the interaction is slowing.  They also have missed a generation, my daughter is 22, and has never had a FB account - her statement is "FB is for Boomers"... Next to last, by now they should be paying dividends and AMZN is my only non-paying dividend stock I own. Finally, I don't like that the board is there for fluff, they have no power, Zuck can't be fired or even told what to do, and that is a bad thing nearing the end of a long run and this company has had a long long run.AMZN was a simple growth buy for me a while back, and my first non paying dividend stock since the dot com timeframe... I bought 200 at 116.97 right after their split.  The reason for my buy:  If they offered a tiered levels based on customer loyalty like Dillards use to offer a black card membership to anyone spending $5000 in their department stores in a year, my wife would surpass the highest levels - get the point?  Second, I  have been both a consumer of their AWS platforms through one of my companies, and another company I owned as a vendor on AMZN, so I have been what I would call a super user of AMZN.  While I think Azure will be the long term winner, AMZN will be sitting in 2nd for a long time.  There platform is very solid, but lacks the Office 365 and Dynamics that solidifies MSFT as the ultimate corporate cloud provider. While I wasn't a Bezos fanboy, I admit they have had and do have decent leadership.  The iRobot purchase makes perfect sense for their vision of being a major player in smart homes.  I also, however, see very strong headwinds from the Fed possibly wanting to split them up.  Although I think these headwinds could be bad for the stock initially,  the long term on that is tremendous if they are split or not...  I know, some just went huh?  So, think back to the big break ups, the winner of the split up wasn't Joe Consumer, it was Victor Stockholders... people made serious money long term when the government forced the break up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 06:54:00'] META has a lot more upside IMO
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 20:42:39'] META for the price now. Would like AMZN lower.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 20:15:54'] AMZN. Meta is dying
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 21:05:15'] AMZN and not even close.  With META you have the company, the way the ownership is structured, controlled by the Zuck.  I think he’s played out his run, his invasive business model has been put out to the curb by Apple.  AMZN you have their AWS growth, new business initiatives in process.  If I was debating between two tech stocks, MSFT would replace META in the decision.  Might just put half with AMZN and half with MSFT if you are limiting these funds to one or two individual stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 21:31:11'] AMZN hands down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 22:46:28'] Everyone is gonna say AMZN, not because they have thoroughly looked at their financials, but because they dislike Zuckerberg. I wouldn’t take peoples advice on Reddit for buying stocks. Most of the people on here have probably never even looked at a balance sheet. Do your own research or get a financial advisor, like a real one.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 20:22:32'] There is no shot in the deep frozen blue hell, you should be considering META. Go with Amazon or consider Google if you’re looking for tech giants specifically.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 23:36:10'] I would not buy meta. I would buy just about any other Fang stock first.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 01:30:43'] Amazon by forever, unless you want to bet against Burry
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 20:11:53'] Meta, obvs. AMZN overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 21:00:34'] If you're hard-pressed on parking money in tech, then I'd suggest XLK. The options are pretty liquid if you're looking to sell covered calls against your position, and you'll end up having exposure to both META and AMZN (among others in the tech sector) so you won't have to pick a winner.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 00:28:33'] The Metaverse is a reason for which I want to sell my Meta Stocks, bevause it is super expansive and makes no sense. Facebook is dieing, Insta is slowly over the top and looses its value. Meta should have bought tiktok and maybe a gaming company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 19:32:12'] If I had to choose one of the two, which I wouldn’t personally, I’d choose Meta over Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 22:12:11'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 00:03:18'] Undoubtedly AMZN. I don’t feel confident about META anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 21:34:41'] Both decent. In 5 years at this price I would guesstimate that Meta will bring your higher profits. They had a bad year within a bad market year so it’s overweight right now.I also agree with whoever is saying MSFT. It’s also low for its worth and the dividends + growth are nice in a portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 22:17:15'] I actually would invest into GOOG over either of these two.  Also like Apple over these two.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 02:49:00'] I think both are okay. I really like meta and think they’ll be in the top 10 companies for a long time. Maybe do a 50/50 split or if you’re worried about Zuck 60/40 to Amazon. If not just an etf

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 05:13:23'] META in my opinion is a value trap right now. It’s look enticing because of previous history, but company is in trouble. Burning billions in cash on metaverse that isn’t in a great place, no real strategy outline provided by Zuckerberg so no idea where money is actually going, reels is not going to get fixed, and people are not using FB. AMZN on the other hand has AWS which is going to be a massive part of cloud infrastructure that is already doing well. Not to mention they own the e commerce space already. Personally feel like AMZN is best (just my opinion) and META is very risky even at this valuation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 05:19:21'] Given the binary nature of the question have you considered diversification? Why not buy 50 of each?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 05:39:09'] If I had to choose it would be AMZN for sure. I don't think META is destined for great things at all. In fact, we could be witnessing the slow death of the company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 05:47:49'] Meta stock is way down, so if you had to pick one, I'd go with the one on sale.But you should probably put money into an index fund.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 06:31:08'] To mimic a lot of the replies here: GOOGBut to answer your question: METAI think AMZN is quite possibly one of the greatest companies on Earth and buying today will yield a positive return moving forward. I just fear their current valuation is still a bit lofty and prices in a considerable amount of future growth.META on the other hand has seen it’s share price ravaged by government regulation fears and doubts about the metaverse. But at a PE of 13, the fact that the company is more profitable than ever and no debt? Yeah I’ll buy some here. Even if the metaverse never pans out (psst… GOOG, MSFT and AAPL are working on the metaverse too, btw) their social media endeavors are quite lucrative. And FB, however hated, boasts a monthly active user base of roughly half the world population.You probably can’t go wrong with either… or any FAAMG stock for that matter. But me personally, I’m gonna limit my FAAMG exposure to VOO and add shares of GOOG and META as a lean.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 07:00:49'] I just don't see a future for Meta.  They're spending a lot of money on the metaverse which I expect to be a disaster financially.Uncertain on AMZN.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 07:29:42'] Way more upside with Meta but a bit riskier. Why not 50 50?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 07:51:50'] I'd say AMZN is the safer bet, while META has higher upside in the short to medium term due to the lower evaluation.However in a situation like this, if you like both companies, why not just buy 50 shares of each?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 08:39:27'] If I had to pick one then definitely Amazon - AWS will continue growing, and Amazon getting into cable/streaming could offer more upside as well.Google and Microsoft are better buys though imo. Amazon is spending aggressively for growth which is great, but that doesn’t guarantee that the money is being spent efficiently
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 08:47:41'] 100 % Amazon. Maybe buy some now and some after earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 09:07:24'] Ignoring the $1500 difference in those two positions, I’d say AMZN. Partial bias because I despise social medias, but also because:- Meta’s VR stuff is garbage- Boomers make up most of FB users and they’re gunna start dying off soon- Amazon is going to literally own the world between all of its services, AWS in particular
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 09:33:28'] AMZN all day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 10:54:06'] YTD - Meta is down 60.4%. Morning star rating of 4 or 5 stars and other institutions are a recommended buyYTD - Amazon is down 31.5%. Morning star rating of 5 stars and many other institutions are a recommended buy.Both have strong price forecasts but I am still bullish on Meta. Ignore the noise on Facebook & Metaverse. Strong revenue plus their other product lines with Instagram and Whatsapp.I do like the recommendation from many here, just do 50/50 of each.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 11:42:26'] AMZN - I just don't see how Facebook will continue their growth with Apple and Google changing their privacy policy, and TikTok kicking their ass with the younger generation.Say Facebook somehow manages to pull off Metaverse, how many people will actually sign up?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 00:24:56'] Honestly I would avoid AMZN and META. AMZN - I would avoid because Dave Clark bet big on the fulfillment network during Covid on the assumption that Covid order volumes would remain following the reopening. It did not. The network is vastly over extended. There is far too much capacity. Amazon has hundreds of buildings that are sitting vacant due to the slowdown. This overhead is going to greatly weigh down the core business. AWS is a cash cow that buoys Amazon, but it is slowly losing market share to a growing field of competitors. Pharmacy has serious potential. I think there is growth potential specifically on speculative basis, the market may keep Amazon stock up through rough financials because they believe Amazon is a winner long term. 3-5 years I think there are some better bets to be made. 5-10 year outlook I am more bullish on AMZN. META - I wouldn’t touch this stock with a 10 ft pole. Zuck’s bet on the metaverse is delusional. There are definite applications, but I doubt we’ll see massive buy in. It seems like a pet project that is getting far too much funding. Sheryl Sandberg is a big reason for META’s success, her leaving will leave a leadership and directional void. Also their core marketing business is under attack from regulators and consumers. The more consumers see how much of their data is being collected and sold I believe there will be greater regulation on consumer data collection. When that happens META is exposed to risk all the way to insolvency. I’m very bearish here, others I’m sure will disagree, but it’s just like, my opinion man. I’d say go for MSFT or GOOG if you are set on a tech stock.

I hope all those people find new emplayment soon.  But amazon panicked when they started to over-hire 1-2 years ago (same as EVERYONE else) -  now they admit their HR mis-management mistakes and are correcting them.   Plus, they are firing mostly in loss-producing sectors like their unprofitable electronics line (Alexa, etc.), or so I understand. Not their warehouse personnel.Would you rather have them keep 18,000 people ($50K to $200K per year each) for no other reason than to drain their finances (YOUR finances, if you own their stock)?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 09:37:01'] they're cutting the fat.The problem with tech companies is that friends of friends of friends of friends get hired, you get a lot of bullshitters who lie about their qualifications and effectively sit around exchanging oxygen for CO2 and get paid to do it.This is a problem in the tech sector, and you end up with all these people claiming they do things for the company, but you look into it and their job consists of doing paperwork or holding meetings with some other department that exists to also hold meetings and file paperwork with their department.I personally have witnessed this with a friend's ex. He worked for one of the smaller companies in the LA area. He acted like he knew what he was talking about, but knew nothing, and bragged about how easy his job was and all he had to do is attend meetings, and push his work off onto others for 130k a year.So now people like this are being cut because these companies are now auditing their staff and realizing they're not getting results out of a lot of them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 10:00:13'] That’s rough, for the longest time, Amazon has been known to treat its employees like disposable human capital.  As a stock, pretty lame honestly, dropped to more than half of its market price since a year ago. Plus with this news, I doubt investors are bullish.

If you are employed by AMAZON and they get into trouble, you may (1) get laid off or lose your job AND (2) all your life savings are tied to only your company which is now in trouble. Most folks would say YES to take advantage of any stock offerings that you would get at a discount in the company you work for - but to diversify and sell it as soon as you are vested and invest in a broad based index fund like VTSAX (total US market) or VTWAX (US plus international exposure). Or if you would prefer picking individual stocks, you need to invest in 20-50 different stocks to decrease risk. I have been burned by a "sure thing" and would never go all in on a single or limited number of stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 11:07:08'] I think there is a possibility that AMZN is greatly undervalued and within 2-3 years it could be 2-3x it's current value so in one sense it could be a good move.  I'm not sure what its current price target is but before the split many analysist had pegged its valuation at around $4000 per share.  So I would spend a little time researching that because currently you would be able to buy the stock at near it's 5 year low.  That is the best argument I can make as to why I think it could be a good thing but you do have to keep in mind that moving all your eggs into one basket is a risk move, but with this kind of market I don't think any investments are safe.  Personally I think your young enough to take that risk but realize if you keep your 401K plan and invest $1000 per month, by the time you reach retirement age you will have at least $5 million dollars so long as you have enough discipline to not withdraw the money and get at least 8% annual return and so long as World War 3 doesn't result in a socialist dictatorship.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 14:47:57'] S&P 500 grows around 50% to 100% every 4 years even when there’s a crash over a 4 year period even before the crash would’ve happened it would gain at the end the equivalent. It never goes wrong. Amazon though really good could go any direction. It’s highly valued and at the same time could just one day go neutral for 4 years and gain nothing. I’d say stay with the S&P 500 for safe solid growth, and have maybe 10% in Amazon. And also maybe 2% your income to play in risky bets for fun/possible stock trading career. My plan personally is S&P 500 for long holds and 2% my income for risky weekly swing trades. So once a year I will have 2% my income to experiment in the markets.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 02:59:58'] Honestly, no I wouldn’t. AMZN has a lot of business problems they have to solve, specifically how their shipping business operates at a loss. Covid was a boom for Amazon, but they far over-extended, damn near doubling in size in 2 years. The demand for that growth isn’t there and not they are laying off 10k people and closing sites. There is a big chunk of capital invested with negative returns from that over-expansion. It will take years of fiscal responsibility to offset that negative investment. Fiscal responsibility is not something Amazon does well. They may have frugality as a guiding principle, but they are anything but frugal.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 20:08:32'] No!One word, Enron.  Look it up if you don't already know the story.  Many years ago, my father had a safe pension through his employment with our local power company.  When Enron took over he was given that same option.  He converted his entire retirement and became locked into ONE SINGLE STOCK.  When Enron collapsed, the retail traders were able to freely sell their stock, while Enron employees were blocked by company policy from selling.  Before their eyes their retirement savings were gutted while their hands were tied.  My father had to delay his retirement by over 20 years.  No company, no matter how hot or how solid it seems now, is immune from corruption, economic downtrends, or unforseen changes.  When it comes to retirement funds in the stock market, full diversification, along with the freedom to not invest in the market at all, is always the best choice.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 06:38:31'] Amazon seems like a shitty place to work from an outsider. Culture is cutthroat and toxic, and their hiring practices favor bullshitters over subject matter experts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 07:25:45'] the old rule of thumb is that single stocks of any type should be no more than 10-15% of your overall portfolio. this allows you to play with single stocks if you want, or to use an employee stock purchase plan. but it prevents you from getting too heavily invested into any one thing that might blow up. Enron is the infamous example, one of the biggest companies in America and they pumped up their stock and lots of employees lost fortunes when the company collapsed. Dave Ramsey tells the story of a woman he knew who had a $750k 401k invested entirely in Proctor & Gamble stock. good company overall, but their stock had a bad year and she lost half her 401k value. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUNd_v2FbbQ

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-18 14:19:31'] Not financial advice but perhaps ask a financial advisor about opening an IRA and this process. Then, buy all of the discounted AMZN stock with your regular payroll contributions into your 401k, and then on a bi-weekly or monthly basis make regular transfers/rollovers into the IRA. Then you have the flexibility in the IRA to sell part of the AMZN shares that you bought at discount and buy other stocks to build a balanced portfolio in the IRA. Many companies allow rollovers into IRA’s while you are still working for them. Again seek a financial Advisor to clarify any limitations in your 401k to verify this, but it can be done.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 04:38:48'] Simply NO. Keep it in the low cost S&P 500 thank me  later in life when you have the ability to see how amazon price drops in the long run Why do i think amazon is overpriced? PE is close to 50 that would mean Amazon has to grow atleast 50% a year in earnings to be considered fair value. The probability of Amazon being undervalued right now with the growth rate it needs is low. It is a much smarter bet to say Amazon price will eventually drop becuase people will lose excitement over the company and amazon peaking in growth or even amazon not able to translate topline revenues to bottom line.

POST_TEXT: b"So cloudflare works by deploying lots of computer over the world that connected together; catch the websites info so that when ppl connect the webs, they're physically closer (and therefore faster); meanwhile, users connect webs through cloudflare's local computer which is shielded/projected.\n\nI like  what they do. But I don't know if they its over-valued or they've already at the phase in which growth is small and steady. Does their business model generate as much income as those ads based tech companies in future (Big tech are basically ads-based company, except Apple and MSFT ) ? What are their economic moat to become a potential monopolist like Amazon and Google?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 17:56:33'] They are growing their revenues at 40%+ (edit: 50%+ wow) annually which is very attractive. They are trying to compete directly with Zscaler and AWS by being a cheaper or free alternative. Once they suck a customer in, the customer tends to spend money on their other services hence their insane 127% NRR. I think once they build up a really good base of clients (some of who use the free model) who end up loyal to their services, they will be able to switch to either charging normal fees or increasing rates. That’s when they will become profitable.It is definitely a gamble, but Matthew Prince seems determined to be the “fourth cloud”. If you follow his Twitter, he’s almost like an Elon figure (in the good aspects) in that he is super passionate and driven in crushing the competition. He thinks they are the next disrupter. My shares are betting on this company mostly because of how much I see people talk positively about the products on HackerNews, their revenue growth and their CEO.I am not looking at their debt right now, but from what I can remember reading they are not over leveraged in terms of cash on the BS vs. Long term liabilities. I don’t think there is a problem there.As far as the risk to their business in downturn, cloud and cyber security are becoming almost like paying a utility company at this point. You can’t just turn off the services - you have to have them to operate. It could affect revenue growth numbers, but I don’t think this company is in danger of going under because of a recession.Update (11/29): Cloudflare just tweeted they are raising prices for the first time in 12 years. Pretty bullish IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 16:12:53'] They're a very good company from the users POV. Their core services are free and frankly as a web developer, a godsend. From a business POV, they're bleeding money, so I'm not sure it's a good investment at this point with high interest rates. I'm planning to wait till the feds switch to speeding up the economy rather than slowing it down. That's when I'd consider buying.As far as becoming another tech giant, hell no. They have their niche in cyber security but don't expect them to become a trillion dollar company. Still I can see them being a 10 banger from whatever bottom we'll reach in this downturn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 16:17:12'] Why talk about overvalued if you don't really understand how they make money? One thing I know, companies who sell "free" services that people get to use with minimum hassle tend to grow very big. People are used to not paying for things like privacy, so Cloudflare gives you a lot of things fred so they sell every click to advertisers. Valuation.... probably overvalued as all good companies are.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 20:22:39'] Cloudflare is a CDN company. Proven business model, good tech, above average engineers + product but not the best team in the world.I think their product Ecosystem is sound but everything hinges on execution, wouldn’t place them on a pedestal just yet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 04:14:58'] I'm a Developer and I'm a massive fan of Cloudflare. Right now they are releasing tons of new serverless Products and once they publish their distributed Database Solution (which will come soon) it's possible to build every imaginable Business on the Edge. This would be cheaper than AWS and Google and with better privacy, because User Data isn't their Business Model. It's also faster and easier to use. I think the next years will be huge for Cloudflare.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 18:23:45'] They don't have any kind of moat. Their products are great but the problem is that loads of companies are "all-in" on AWS or Azure or GCP. In my experience, that usually means the first default option that people reach for is whatever product their existing cloud vendor offers. If they do end up with Cloudflare, it's likely because they went through some formal process with multiple departments, comparing products, getting all the right people to sign off, etc. Not saying they're doomed or anything since they have great products. But IMO it's an uphill battle for them at least with a fair number of enterprises out there.

The idea they're going to be irrelevant at any point in the near future is absurd when half the world is using their products. Whether they'll outperform the broader market is another question, but at their current valuation it wouldn't be a bad bet...I think NFLX will be fine too. People love their content and although they're going to see slower growth they'll remain an awesome company imo. I think they've just been valued way too aggressively in recent years and had to come down to a more reasonable valuation. I also wouldn't be surprised if they expand into other forms of entertainment. Gaming, sports, even user-created video and music streaming could be an option imo. I think they have a lot of options for expansion if they were interested, it's just not something they've had to focus on with such healthy growth in their core business until now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 19:02:19'] Strange reaction to these results. Take Rivian gain away, net income comes in half of Q4 2020 and flat YOY in comparison. AWS continues to bear the burden of the underlying negative earning business. Long on AMZN as they continue to spare no expense for market dominance but the celebratory reaction is overblown
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 19:03:59'] This market is insane, seeing blue chips like GOOG, AMD or AMZN down 5% a day then up 15% the day after, WTF.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 21:14:18'] IMO the reaction wasn’t due to the algos misinterpreting the EPS number, it was due to the fact that people were panic buying OTM puts on AMZN. That dragged the stock lower during the day and now those puts have all been burned.After that gets burned off officially at open (this fact is going to lead to a gap up, maybe not 14%, but something like 10%), it’ll be interesting to see how this trades. If faded hard, there are serious issues.It’ll fade for sure, but I’m not looking for something crazy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 23:08:44'] Amazon’s beat is from gain on their stake in Rivian, a company with no cars or earnings. Amazon’s $27.75 GAAP EPS is far above the expected $3.58 consensus with the help of their $11.8B gain related to their investment in Rivian. this is more than creative financing, this is a bubble inside a bubble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 01:33:23'] Amazon made $14.5bn in profit and then raised the price of prime due to "rising costs of labor"This can't last much longer
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 16:27:15'] Anyone calling this an earnings miss is a fool. They "missed" sales target by $200mil........on an $136.4 BILLION figure!That's like 0.14% "miss"Meanwhile their EPS destroyed estimates by 600%. AWS segment growing 40%+ YoY as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 13:13:54'] Dang, I was hoping it would drop a bit more. Wanted to get in at $2500.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 14:44:51'] Shocking EPS…the revenue was just about inline, but EPS was huge…..most expected cost to be up with pandemic, inflation, and just pretty much everything going up. Is the huge EPS due to automation paying off way beyond expectation. I am also thinking that the jump on stock price is more due to the prime membership increase rather than just the earning beat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 15:51:41'] Amazon, Snap, Pins all went hugely down today before earnings. Suddenly they pop up to 58% (snap). Someone must have insider knowledge. I don't believe in coincidences. Guess some have sold out just to buy up again after earnings. Cheap stocks and good gain.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 18:03:00'] Ha!  Not at all surprised.  We really have the wheat being separated from the chaff.I am kind of glad because it has bugged me a little that some of these companies that do not deserve high market caps were getting them.   Companies like Zoom, Paypal, AT&T, Spotify, Snap, the China companies, etc.I have been saying for a long time now on this subreddit to buy Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.  That is where you want to be invested.   I do like Google by far the best of the group.They have the longest runway of the group built on all the Google assets yet to be fully monetized.   Will fuel incredible growth for the foreseeable future.It does mean we have incredible concentration and it is only going to get a lot worse.   You are going to see Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon pull even further away from everything else.What people do not get is that these companies have barely even got started.  Take Google.  Controlling the information to over 90% of the population has value that is just unmatched in the history of man.   Google has even been increasing their market share and would expect that to continue.There is really no true competitor to Google search.  People talk about DDG and Bing but they are total crap compared to Google and that is not going to change.In the end it all comes back to AI/ML and Google is in a different league from everyone else in terms of AI/ML.   They just got it a lot earlier than any of the other FANG companies.   It is how they were able to pick up DeepMind for $500M.   Just an incredible bargain.    Today it would cost 10x that and probably a lot more than that.

Did the dump the shares? RIVN is down 60%.$20 extra for prime? That's about 2B in extra revenue, just 1/1000 of market cap, and only if all prime member renew. TBH prime is getting harder to justify.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 15:27:49'] Definitely Google.  Much better price in comparison to forward earnings.  Amazon is going to have more issues with inflation costs.  Both will have issues if we get a recession.Long term Amazon should be fine, but they may have some rough water to get there and their stock is still expensive.  Google looks pretty cheap and doesn't have nearly as many problems ahead of them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 22:48:26'] Both. Amazon is perfectly setup to take advantage of AI in the next few years with robot distribution in warehouses. When this technology is fully developed it will bring in crazy profitability. At 20% from peak, this is a great time to accumulate both.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 14:17:05'] They makeup 8% of SPY, but only 4% of VT.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 20:30:56'] Be careful about people saying “easily google.” If that was the case, then buying x amount of google and shorting x amount of amzn would be free money.

Every single one of their fundamentals is better, they trade at a better earnings multiple, and they have a near monopoly on a substantial part of their business.Amazon does not have the moat people think they do. Cloud services and streaming have solid competition, and their marketplace will slowly get whittled away as businesses setup their own shops.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 17:08:57'] I don't understand why you consider project Kuiper to be a game changer. They signed launch contracts at 3 times the price of SpaceX and have plans for 10x fewer satellites. Ok maybe they're probably not equal, but I doubt they come close to 10x performance of SpaceX's stuff, especially the next gen ones which are bigger.Basically even if space internet is an absolutely huge opportunity, Amazon will only take a small and costly slice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 18:26:24'] Google. No doubt. Amazon can fall a long way. AWS is great, but really the central value in Amazon. Streaming can we worth zip. As can the consumer goods side.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:50:37'] I have a fair value for GOOGL around $3900 ($2370 at close) and an estimated 25% growth rate. For AMZN fair value at $2324 ($2891 at close ((and falling)) and an estimated growth of 24%. I think GOOGL has the upper hand right now but I will not discount out AMZN anytime soon. I helped build one of their distribution centers, which I hope they do not pull the plug on that capex yet, and the amount of future EV infrastructure they put in is impressive. I am not sure where they are going all electric but they are getting ready for it. The high cost of fuel and doubling the workforce, Covid and the war in Ukraine are all aspects that they claim to have hurt the bottom line. 2022 maybe a time to hold and watch AMZN but long term I believe it will continue to be a great company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 14:37:06'] You should stop worrying about what the price is of a stock and more whether it’s value is correct.

Plus they have so many other sleeper bets like verily life sciences, access, google x, capital g, gv, calico and much more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 20:03:40'] Both are good long-term bets but Google is better. Google is about to undergo a 20:1 stock split , and that usually drives up the share price in the short-run so it would be the better choice for a swing trade. They are involved in all sorts of innovation, they are the cornerstone of the internet, Android phones, 5g, satellites & geolocation, etc. They are globalized and do not rely heavily on supply chains. Amazon has more headwinds short-term and long term. It is likely to face more serious competition as other major retailers seek to outdo it with shipping and perks. Everything from pet stores to household durables are seeing other retailers start to challenge Amazon in that space (in this case, Chewy and Wayfair). No company needs to replace Amazon, many companies just need to whittle away at different chunks of its business.That said, AWS servers make Amazon more money than anything else and those are more like Google in how widespread their use it. Amazon is also planning on moving much more heavily into grocery deliveries which is great - and will be welcomed by many. Of course, even there new competition is arising as food delivery services begin branching out into groceries.Amazon and Google aren't going anywhere, but Amazon has more potential to get cut down to size.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 17:09:31'] Thing about Amazon is there is a good chance there earnings will explode in a couple years with all the investments they are making.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 03:46:13'] Love both. But would give the nod to Google.  They have more moats than Amazon.  But there is also no better cash machine than search.But the biggest reason is Google hs more assets yet fully moentized than Amazon and that creates the stronger runway.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 09:11:39'] A small bit of advice. Comparing just stock prices against each other is useless. The better route would be to compare them using something like pricing multiples. That tells you what investors are currently willing to pay for each dollar of earnings from that company, and allows you to compare “cheap or expensive” for stocks that may be of wildly different prices/ company sizes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 16:24:40'] Is this even a serious question? There is no comparison. Amazon trade at over 60 Forward P/E and just released a terrible earning report....a big miss on almost anything relevant aside for the cloud and with a revenue growth rate at the minimum since over a decade and less than the rate of inflation. Even trading at 30 P/E will be too high given these pathetic earnings since it would still trade at higher valuations than Microsoft, Google and Apple that reported much better earnings.I would never enter this stock at anything above 2000/share and even below 2000 I'd have to think because the only real good thing Amazon has is their cloud business.So, between Google and Amazon, definitely Google.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 02:52:10'] Probably not going to be good but could do okay if market expects awful and they're merely bad. If you have AMZN and AAPL not do well after earnings after GOOGL, MSFT and META cratered, I think people are going to have to consider that tech may not be the place to be for a while, yet that doesn't necessarily mean the market tanks, it may wind up with different leadership for some time. If that's the case, I think it's going to be difficult for people after a dozen or so years of MSFT/AAPL/GOOGL/AMZN being such a cornerstone of so many portfolios.edit: I'm not talking about 2022 - agree, obviously tech has been horrible in 2022, nasdaq down a lot, etc. What I'm saying is more 2023, 2024, 2025 and what if the market recovers but with other leadership than tech? People are still buying all these tech household names and it feels like there's an increasing possibility that the recovery for tech (especially more speculative tech) might be disappointing vs prior (2018, especially 2020) bear markets. People may have to consider a somewhat different playbook for the coming years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 23:23:31'] Don’t like e-commerce. AWS is good.E-commerce is a low margin business. It can support 500bn companies like Walmart but profit potential is limited beyond that.People like to say they could be wildly more profitable if they didn’t have opex or capex, which is magically waving away real costs. E-commerce just takes a lot of money to run.AWS on the other hand is super profitable, extremely high margin and grows much faster than e-commerce.There’s nothing wrong with a Walmart-like business but it just doesn’t fit the same profile as AWS.It’s like if Microsoft sold their Azure business to Walmart. Then to invest in Azure you need to invest in Walmart. That’s what Amazon is today. Most tech investors just want the aws exposure without the Walmart.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 20:56:56'] AMZN will do great at 2300 in the long term.  They are doing things with customer data that will give them an edge for decades. AWS is a money machine to power a lot of new bets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-30 02:06:20'] Amazon has become very capital intensive over the past two years, having more capex than railroads. The biggest question will be if the current capex cycle will stop at some point and thereafter land into shareholders return or not. The risk of antitrust fines could be real if not in the US then in the EU.As for my opinion, i think amazon has become too asset heavy and will stay burdened by too much capex. It wont be a bad stock but it wont be an outperformer in a 5 to 10 year span

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-30 19:41:54'] I see Amazon going to $4000 in a year. Get in now. It's discounted.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-30 04:40:11'] The company will prosper, that's for sure. But their e-commerce business barely makes a profit. And their star attraction, AWS, is currently enjoying a "first to market" premium, which will be eroded as competition makes "cloud" into a commodity.My own valuation puts a fair price at $1,500 for Amazon, although I have been accused of being too optimistic with that. Certainly, though, at somewhere in the $1,000 to $1,500 range sounds like a sensible buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-30 08:13:58']  I recently watched the documentary, Enron: The Smartest Guys in the room. There are spooky similarities between Amazon and Enron. Outwardly, Amazon is a money printer but internally the majority of major programs an unprofitable mess. Aside from Kindle, AWS, and some retail orgs very few orgs are profitable. Also, Amazon uses mark-to-market accounting. I wouldn't be surprised if they mark failed projects as profits based on the a fictitious "market value". The most profitable org is AWS. Literally the entire company propped up by a single organization. There are few likely scenarios where this becomes a massive risk:- Regulators force a split of AWS and Retail that removes the most profitable org from the rest of the company. Amazon is ripe for antitrust lawsuits. AWS has potential visibility into the computing resources for direct competitors to Amazon retail. If data ever leaks between both either org you best believe regulators will intervene. - AWS experiences stagnating revenue. Cloud computing is B2B subscription based model. If a strong economic downturn causes other business to halt adoption of cloud products AWS could theoretically saturate the market in a relatively short timeframe.  The most likely scenario is that AWS has reached complete saturation of businesses that are able/willing to leverage cloud technology. There's only so much upselling AWS can do to current customers. Unprofitably is rampant in AWS, not just Retail. The majority of AWS's revenue comes from EC2 and S3.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:05:06'] Target feels like a real buy right now. A %3.3 yield on its dividend and I expect it will recover at least some this year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:11:36'] Pypl ans target are such great buys at these levels.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:31:15'] I bought a bit of IEP under 20 as a punt. Anyone else looking at it? Carl owns 85% of the stock so I'm not sure how it was able to drop so precipitously.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 19:48:21'] Anyone thinking that NVDA will pull back?  I bought some puts at close today.  The market was up and it seems like people will be taking their profits after this massive run!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:21:16'] Today is definitely going to impact the rate hike conversation. I still think we see a pause but as a guest on Bloomberg was saying yesterday, two more .25 hikes with recession later this year is beginning to look much more probable than just a month ago. He said the Fed is committed to seeing the unemployment rate drop 1 point or more, and in 12 out of 12 times that has happened, it has induced a recession and the S&P has dropped.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:34:15'] Started a position in GOOGL at near ATH (November 2021) and so close to finally breaking even. I'll pop a champagne when it does.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:24:57'] I’m not gonna lie, I’m happy with the tech run, but it’s been so good that I find it suspect. Begin to worry about a backfire.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:32:23'] I really hope this rally last and all the people that are down the last couple years can recoup a lot of their losses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:05:32'] So $MVST Microvast is up 10% today despite being investigated by Schall Law (potential investor class action suit) for not disclosing ties to the Chinese Communist Party?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 15:19:23'] "I've always said if you spend 13 minutes a year on macroeconomics, you've wasted 10 minutes," said Peter Lynch.I feel like today's crazy job print goes to show even "professional" economists can't even agree or predict what has happened last, not even the coming month, with all the real-time data they have.  How the hell can we expect ANYONE to be able to what will happen several quarters from now, a year from now?Recession, soft-landing, mid-cycle downturn... no one damn knows which is why you should focus on investing in something that looks undervalued to you and you're willing to hold for a long time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:59:56'] without any new news this weekend I expect the telekom stocks to gain back 2/3 of what they lost today on monday opening.

Feels like consumer will be tapped out after this summer travel season. Could be good opportunity. Possibly move into the XLP now, since it’s been underperforming and follows the same logic.

We are making history with the single, greatest most unstoppable QQQ/tech rally ever. It's not even debatable. Every other rally had pullbacks/ temporary setbacks, but this just goes flat and consolidates rather than even having a real red day.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 00:07:41'] Just keep in mind Amazon is investing like crazy right now, which is why their earnings are low and the PE is high. Those investments are supposed to pay off at one point, at which point investments will go down and earnings will go up.The only question you need to answer is whether you think they're investing in the right things and whether you believe it will pay off, and that requires some research.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 03:31:30'] I got an AWS certification.  About half way through the study guide I went and bought a bunch of AMZN. When I finished the course I bought more. I knew AWS was impressive going in but the more I learned, the more I realized they are in a whole different league. 20 years working in the tech sector and I never been more impressed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-14 20:55:21'] I think it’s undervalued right now. The P/E is high because they are trying to monopolize e-commerce and logistics which will pay off huge if they are successful (they are on the path). AWS alone is worth what Amazon is trading at based on dcf models.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-14 21:01:25'] Even if you only focus on AWS, Amazon is a good investment
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 09:20:49'] Amazon is like a kraken. It’s tentacles stretch out and touch everything. If you can’t find something at the store, it’s on Amazon. My biggest concern is government. When a company becomes too large and too influential they tend to fall out of favor with government. Anyone remember a company called ATT? So as long as government keeps it’s nose out of it, Amazon will continue to grow and innovate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-14 20:46:16'] AWS is going to generate most of the profits in the next 5 years.That said, their retail business has tons of risk. So can the profits from AWS grow way faster than the issues with retail. I think AWS is the main reason the PE is so high right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 14:57:58'] Fill disclosure: amzn is the largest individual holding in my portfolio.If there is one company to buy right now, it's Amazon. Amazon has not strayed from its playbook even one bit throughout their years of existence. They have made mistakes, costly ones at times, and have learnt their lessons but their core philosophy has remained the same. Generate more and more free cash flow, invest that to generate even more free cash flow.Amazon doesn't care much about their stock price, don't try to position themselves as a mature stock or company to smoothen their metrics like price up earnings or net profits like every other companies of their size which is why it is so hard to valuate them the same way as other companies. This meant it was flying under radar for decades until people discovered its true value in 2016 since which it's stock price rose like crazy. Now times are grim again and people are again using the same yardstick to measure every company and that obviously means Amazon does not look attractive.Right now is the time again to invest like its 2014.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 10:37:22'] Most of these comments are taking no account of profitability or valuation. You're talking entirely about growth of various metrics: assets, revenues etcI guess that's fine if the growth resumes AND the market continues to prefer growth and mostly ignore profitability, but what if it doesn't?Based on what's happening to other stocks, it seems that the market has become skeptical about growth, so multiples are shrinking. That's bad for growth stocks and especially bad for very large ones like AMZN. Big companies are harder to grow, eventually and the pandemic that goosed AMZN sales is now mostly over, making comps tougher.The reason value investors focus on profitability is that growth is both hard to sustain and hard to predict. Some folks here and on Wall Street take comfort in the supposed rigour of DCF analysis, but those are inevitably just a big stack of assumptions about growth.Amazon is huge and dominant, but outside AWS, it's never been very profitable. CEO Bezos is famous for insisting that just getting bigger was the answer and for a long time, he looked right, because AMZN was taking over the world and anybody who balked about its profitability ratios missed the giant run up that made him the world's richest man.Ultimately, making money should matter, as expressed by things like net earnings margin, ROE,  ROA etc. The good news is that there isn't too much net debt relative to cash flow, but net profit margin is under 5%, slightly better than a grocery store. Without AWS, that would be much worse, so is spinning off AWS realistic? The non AWS stubco would have even lower, Kroger-esque margins.Kroger trades at 25x trailing earnings, which seems too high, not 50x like AMZN. Kroger's EV/EBITDA is 9, not 20.At today's prices, AMZN'S  trailing PE is still over 50 and EV/EBITDA is 20. Forward PE is over 40. Not remotely cheap.  I'm not saying AMZN should trade like a grocery stock, just that it's still super expensive.Peter Lynch would say five year earnings growth should be about equal to PE at fair value, yielding a PEG of 1, and recommends finding PEGs below 1. PEG is imperfect because, like DCF, it depends on estimated growth,  but AMZN's PEG is between 1.3 and 2.7, according to Yahoo Finance and Finviz, who obviously assume different growth rates. Again, not cheap.ROE is decent at over 15% but not stellar. ROA is very low on a huge pile of assets. Profitability has never mattered in AMZN's history, but if it starts to matter as growth inevitably slows, the stock doesn't look at all compelling by the standards applied to other companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 05:21:12'] Whenever I see reddit so adamant on something, it worries me. So many comments saying to invest in Amazon for AWS alone

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 10:03:50'] Keep it. The drop in AMZN is strongly caused by China's situation ( supply shortage).  You can't deliver a product if it hasn't arrived in the fulfillment center. The price of a stock is forward looking and with the current situation, the calculation is based on the assumption that the supply shortage will be permanent and China will be in permanent lockdown, which doesn't make sense. The real money maker for AMZN is AWS and it's undisputable king of the hill ( stronger than Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud). People are strongly biased to AWS, the same way people only like to use Microsoft Excel and prefer Coca Cola.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-14 22:11:35'] It spent way too much to increase its infrastructure. Need to refocus on its core competency. A 900  pound gorilla does not know which way to go.  Tim Cook was forced to give out dividend as it is a 42 year old company. Apple could easily transform to cloud computing but dwell on i-products.  Amazon wanted to get into grocery, eCommerce, streaming, retail etc.  When a company has lost focus it will not expand like before.  I looked at its stock price and not sure buy back, split can help much.The high interest cost to borrow will hurt Amzn or any company. It has the lowest cash on hand amount similar size tech companies. It has as little as GE and UNH. So it needs to borrow and spent tons on interest.  It will have a negative impact on future.  Needless to say analysts all are aware of its problems.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 05:16:58'] My concern would be that they have invested heavily in their own truck fleet and have been hiring as fast as they can for the warehouse and delivery services.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 05:44:27'] At this point in the correction, I personally would not sell unless you can’t afford for it to drop further. I also personally would not buy if I were not holding it already.There’s a good probability that it will drop further, but the probability that AMZN, in particular, has bottomed out is also good. So whether you hold or not depends on your conviction and what your time window is. About timing: While tech is likely to continue to drop more as the fed makes the next few rate hikes, you have to start looking at whether best of breed tech stocks are going to start bottoming out (which they will before the sector as a whole bottoms out). So one way to approach the decision might be to consider whether you think tech stocks as a whole are close/not close to bottoming. If you think they might be close to bottoming, consider whether you think best of breed stocks are starting to break out from the other stocks that are still falling, and if so, whether AMZN is one of those best of breed stocks.So my answer is I personally would not sell unless you can’t afford for it to drop further, unless I wanted to sell for tax purposes. I also personally would not buy if I were not holding it already because I’m looking for signals of a bottom and the fed rate hikes just started.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 06:19:49'] 1. According to [morningstar](https://financials.morningstar.com/valuation/price-ratio.html?t=amzn) Amazons P/E hasn't been any lower than it is now. The general trend has been down so it's inline with this.2. AWS etc have been a big cash cow for them so it makes sense to reinvest in these areas but it's also important to not be entirely dependant on it which explains #3At the end of the day I don't see Amazon going anywhere. Personally The pandemic has changed my behaviour on how I shop with them them. I used to do a little grocery shopping online with normal supermarkets but you basically have to book it a week in advance and they couldn't handle the pandemic and often switch your goods for something similar. Meanwhile with amazon fresh I can literally book it at midnight and get it in the morning so basically that's what I do now. They simply do things better.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 06:51:44'] They basically take what they make on AWS and reinvest it into other areas in hopes it will improve margins and make them profitable down the road. I’m assuming that’s why they are expanding their warehouses and logistics network. It’s the same playbook they’ve always used. PE shouldn’t be the concern. They’ve consistently said they only care about free cash flow. That went in the negative, so that’s where people should bring up issues.

If you do this (google finbox DCF 5-year exit and experiment with the growth rates.

So that's Amazon, Shopify., ebay etc These are huge companies beginning to finally over as they lose their safe haven status, the last place people thought their savings would be safe in.This is all while we haven't officially entered a recession yet. Also, all the arguments against recession are all precarious. The consumer 'balance sheet' being strong (high savings, low debt) and thus demand being healthy, is temporary.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-06 19:22:43'] interest rates!  this is a big reason why inflation is so consequential to financial assetsand in a u.s. stock market dominated by tech these days (long duration asset), the effects are felt to a greater extent.why do rates matter so much? contrary to common opinion, it is not necessarily because of companies holding extensive debt, which is argued that would then need to be refinanced.   in fact, a company may very well benefit from this inflationary environment if they hold fixed rate debt (inflation + higher rates will dramatically reduce this cost of capital); and should rates fall prior to such a company actually needing to refinance (not terribly unlikely imo) then they can theoretically reap the reward of our current rate/inflation environment without the pain on the backend.  so why are long duration stocks getting crushed? because in investment valuation models (example: discounted free cash flow), you discount the future cash flows by the cost of capital, which is heavily influenced by interest rates! higher rates = higher discount rate = lower value of free cash flows. (check out the capm for those uninitiated)this principle holds true for all stocks, bonds, etc. however, these growth stocks don't generate a lot of free cash flows, and are not poised to generate a lot of free cash flows in the near future (if ever). thus, those far distant free cash flows get penalized even more from that higher discount rate. (discounting 100$ of free cash flows one year from now is worth a whole lot more than discounting 100$ of free cash flows 10 years from now, especially when that discount rate increases)  for the home builders, it is a bit more straight forward: higher mortgage rates will lead to home price appreciation to slow (possibly decline), which is a direct hit to their bottom line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-06 19:30:53'] Facebook is a bit different because they actually have high cash flow yield and no debt. The others (netflix, PayPal, Amazon) can just crater if they have a bad quarter because the price is propped up on the prospect of growth. If the growth story is no longer there, there's no high cash flow yield and pristine balance sheet to fall back on.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-06 23:49:08'] These stocks can be split into a few categories:\- High flyers - PYPL, NFLX, AMZN, DPZ - High P/E growth stocks.  These got hit by the double barreled shotgun of higher interest rates (which made their future earnings less valuable because they are discounted by a bigger factor) and the prospect of an economic slowdown which will suppress those earnings.  Who would pay 40x earnings for DPZ in that environment?&#x200B;\- Fallen tech angels - FB, you could also throw GOOGL in here.  The market thinks that users are moving to other platforms, and FB will become the next MySpace.  GOOGL is not as dependent on social, so they didn't get hit as hard.&#x200B;\- Home builders - IMHO, this is a knee-jerk reaction of higher rates -> less building -> home builders lose margin and struggle to pay debt.  I am going out on a limb and saying it is different this time, because (1) we still have a housing shortage from the underbuilding of the  2010s (2) builders balance sheets are in much better condition this cycle; many have little or no debt at all and (3) supply chain problems actually have a helpful effect because no competitors can ramp up production to try to take share, meaning supply will remain tight, and they should retain some pricing power.

More than likely large investors took out a loan to buy these stocks and raise the price significantly.  Now that the FED is raising rates they are selling off.  They are saying it is for this reason or that reason.  Like Netflix they say it is because their earnings are down.  But, Newsflash over 2020 people could not leave their homes.  So, everyone bought netflix.  Now everyone has watched everything they care to see on netflix and the company isn't as profitable.  So, their earnings are down.  Netflix will never see an earnings like it did in 2020...thus it is a failure..  NO it just had an exceptional year.  But, that is all a smoke screen.  The truth is large investors are jumping out and taking profit.

POST: ['2022-02-04 18:25:18'] POST TITLE: b'Am I the only one who thinks the market got FB and AMZN wrong?'
POST_TEXT: b"If we delve into the earnings reports for both companies, almost 80% of Amazon's EPS came from it's stake in Rivian as of Dec 31 (which at this point is now much lower). They would have missed earnings without Rivian, and they missed revenue estimates (during a time of 7% inflation, that's actually pretty bad). In addition, their profit margins and FCF decreased. FCF was actually negative, to the tune of $-9 billion. \n\nLets compare that to Facebook/meta. Facebook's advertising income grew 20% YoY, and their VR segment grew by 22%. They beat revenue estimates but missed EPS by 4%. However, they only missed EPS because of a $3.3 billion loss in their VR segment. Without that loss, they would have easily beat EPS by over 20% as well as beating on revenues. Their FCF and profit margins also increased YoY. \n\nIf we compare guidance between the two they both reported disappointing guidance of only 2-8% growth in Q2. However, Facebook is valued at ~17 PE currently while Amazon has a PE of ~59."
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 01:10:30'] Facebook is punished for capex, Amazon is rewarded for capex. That’s how the market works (Wall Street have no idea what, if ever, returns will be on VR investments), unfortunately. However the biggest reason FB dropped was the lower future growth forecasted. But it still dropped way too much considering it’s already relatively low price. It dropped as if it was trading at 30+ p/e prior to the earnings …Facebook is, right now, literally trading at the lowest p/e since it’s IPO….. like it’s going out of business lolIf FB wasn’t so unpopular, the stock would still, easily, be trading above 300$ imho
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:36:48'] I think the same as you. I checked more or less same things you did. And I arrived to a similar conclusion. Hate is big towards MetaBut times like this is when you make money

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 01:30:22'] AWS is awesome, it will carry Amazon through any hardships for a long time. What will carry FB if they start loosing customer. Last quarter gave FB investors  a taste of that. I hate that it feel deep and being a growth tech stoke at 18 p/e it’s steal. But comparing AMZN to FB isn’t apples to apples comparison. AMZN is a beast compared to FB, AMZN is twitch, prime video, Alexa, Fresh, Whole Foods, Amazon.com and AWS now they are into gaming, building their own hardware accelerators and CPUs
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 19:43:12'] Some people feel that FB isn't as strong because it depends on Google and Apple because they own the iOS market space. AKA can't charge the 30% that the other's can't and aren't as big of a monopoly anymore. FB is facing increasing competition in areas it used to dominate. Tiktok is its biggest competitor in the social media platform war at the moment. But look at SNAP with its increased users and subsequent stock price rise. The trend with social media stocks is to trend young, and fb is more millennials.Compare to AMZN. They seem to be increasing their monopoly in the one stop shop area. They feel comfortable in how many people will pay their recently increased yearly subscription because of the fast shipping (some areas 2 hrs).
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 19:34:04'] it isnt about earnings. its is about investors thinking FB business model is much riskier than previously thought. 1. rising compeition from tik tok, youtube, etc 2. decline in active users 3. huge capex into a moonshot project called metaverse, sucking in billlions of cashflowin other words, risk premium has gone up on FB shares
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 21:03:23'] This is normal in the market. Always has been. Good company has bad earnings report and goes on sale. The swings are larger these days with so many new, weak handed players. These are the opportunities the seasoned players are waiting for.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 22:19:14'] Besides the individuals who currently have underwater positions in FB, yes. My take FB - Digital advertising is a huge part of their business, Apple's iOS privacy changes is going to be a significant impact and I don't know how they'd deal with that, if other companies end up going towards that way, I'm not sure how they'd handle that.- The growth of users have also declinedAmazon- Without factoring in Rivian, they still beat estimated EPS, $4.85 I believe (there are various numbers floating out there, but I believe that's the lowest one I saw)- They missed revenue by 0.13%, 137.41B (expected 137.59B). I'm not surprised that they missed, but am glad that they didn't miss it by a huge percentage because their best quarter was Q4 '20, a one-off event where e-commerce dominated.- They've finally moved their advertising revenue from their "other" business segment and noted that it grew 32% YoY to $9.7B and for the year, $31 billion, which is a bit over what YouTube brought in ($28.8B) + the fact that their advertising business isn't affected by other companies, like FB is.- Guess I don't have to mention this, but AWS.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 22:37:58'] They wouldn't have missed earnings without Rivian
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 21:17:23'] it is not the first time for facebook. 2018, facebook also dropped 20 percent in a day. it is election circle. facebook is trying to get itself out of the depends of election ads. the wired guy is trying to lift fb out of circle, he has not succeeded yet, vr, meta or whatever he will try has not worked yet, so I waited to this circle and start loading fb slowly again start today. Invest a company is actually invest the leader, msft used to consider as a walking dead. IBM is a walking dead now, all it takes is a good leader to lead the company to turn all around. I believe the low key wired guy in fb will hit a jackpot. BTW, i also believe fb stock is undervalued now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 21:29:21'] You’re right absolutely. FB has a poor reputation and subjectively came out lower. Look at OBJECTIVITY with stocks-it’s ok to play with the villains here. Dump into FB absolutely and you will make more over the next 5 years than investing into Amzn
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 20:53:36'] I’m not an expert by any means but I think part of it is the market rotating towards reduced risk. FB/Meta is taking a huge risk towards a future payoff and the market is punishing speculation right now. Amazon is still a moneymaking juggernaut and very stable. I’m sure a lot of money that left FB went in Amazon. I bet Amazon wouldn’t have had such a helluva day if Facebook hadn’t had such a horrible day yesterday.

Drop in user growth for the first time ever, losing to competition, spending truckloads of money to essentially transition into a completely different company...The AMZN response I don't get at all, though. The report wasn't good. Revenue missed and was only up 9%, guidance missed. I guess people were happy about the growth in advertising revenue given the concerns with the iOS changes. I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock lose these gains over the next week or so.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 21:01:54'] No, you aren’t. And people who are uber-bullish on AMZN are simple. The positive reaction to their “earnings” was ridiculous…I think it was essentially a mass delusional, desperate hope that tech has found its bottom. It hasn’t.FB has some room to drop yet—based more on sentiment than fundamentals, though. I plan to give it a week or so, but am itching to load up on calls soon, even though I hate the company. Will probably sell AMZN to do it; I’ve only got 10 shares, bought high, but maybe the insanity will continue for a couple days next week and I will finally be green around $3400.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:32:29'] Nope I agree completely. I have Facebook at a significant margin of safety relative to it's intrinsic value (and started opening a position). Amazon I had as being significantly overvalued even before their recent earnings. If Amazon has another bad earnings report next quarter they may very well see a massive selloff like Facebook just did.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:42:48'] You are the only one lol Amazon had a great earnings and is now fairly priced ( hence why it dropped so hard this quarter before earnings Fb is burning 10 bill dollars into the meta and also lost another 10 billion from the privacy changes by apple It’s a no brained why they both reacted the way they did
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:56:07'] Facebook tanked cause they lost users.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 23:08:46'] For Amazon, as someone who has a small amount of it, I'm also unsure how it's getting such a positive reaction. Yes their adjusted (take out Rivian) EPS beat estimates, but those were already lowballed as it could be. Yes AWS great as always, 40% growth is great and it has always been the primary driver of Amazon's profits. Yes, they raised Prime member prices, which at best has a net effect of $5bn to annual revenue. But:they missed on revenue in what is probably the best year for e-commerce you could ask for. Their rivian shares will get re-rated substantially lower in Q1. Their operating margins are razor thin, I believe around 2% or less. Their PE is still hardly cheap, in the 50s. They are aware of this and gave pretty poor guidance ahead as well. So why is everyone gushing over Amazon right now when I would at best call their results "okay" to mildly disappointing. Not being a bear or cynic, I'm long the stock, but I find myself questioning my own fundamental understanding of the company right now to be honest. Hope someone can enlighten me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 07:00:52'] I feel like, in my very non-expert opinion, that this was the quarter when the market realized that the future of amazon (actually probably the present, too) is primarily as a cloud computing company that happens to run an e-commerce side-gig.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:34:03'] Bro. You’re fucking delusional cherry picking nonsense to support some bullshit narrative. You’re literally gaslighting yourself. If AMZN spun off just AWS, AWS would be bigger and way more profitable than FB. This is an actual fact. I’d tell you to run the numbers but reading the shit you just posted I can confirm that won’t be happening. But yea. AWS was “good.”
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:27:46'] Yes, you are.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:35:39'] > They would have missed earnings without RivianGod this is such a naïve take. You think analysts just forgot about Rivian? If They didn't have anything to do with Rivian their projected earnings would have been lower. If Rivian were still at ATH their expected earnings would have been higher. That's like the easiest thing to adjust your targets for. Amazon has been plowing billions into itself to grow, it's not looking to max out earnings at all costs like AAPL or GOOG may be.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 04:49:25'] Amazon wasn’t allowed to drop.  The market isn’t based on fundamentals anymore.  Maybe it will be someday.  The Qs were already down 4% the day Amazon dropped earnings.  If the reaction was based on amazons poor fundamentals then the market would’ve hit circuit breakers in AH.  Can’t have that hitting the headlines while they core out the indexes and rebalance into blue chips before the fed starts trimming their balance sheet.  It’s all a rigged casino.  Trillion dollar companies move like penny stocks now. Entire indexes are like penny stocks now.  There’s no meaning to any significant move any more.  The simple fact is a small number of firms control a vastly disproportionate amount of money and have the sole power to dictate which way the market moved and by how much.  Even if “how much” is trimming a mega cap like Facebook 25% in AH trading when the normal shmo can’t even react.  Lots of “stay the path” people here but this market is batshit and completely distorted. There’s a reckoning on its way.  Don’t fight the fed works both ways.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 19:21:21'] I agree...AMZN earnings were actually bad and should have tanked the stock and market overall as amazon is a much bigger part of the US economy anyway.  But people are dumb and dont get the RIVN factor...gonna be pissed next quarter when that goes away when prime members drop due to the price bump, buy out PTON, have to spend a ton to do their in person clothing stores and sales drop as people get out more...AWS, that's the only thing that could save them(maybe RIVN stock if it bounces and they still have shares).FB investing and changing their name based on tech that is at least 5-10 years away from becoming mainstream was probably a huge mistake, but it is the right move in the long run, but investors dont think past a quarter...VR/AR is the future but they should of done it on the down low...i think they now realize that VR wont happen quick enough for them to survive(they actually need that stock price high in order to recruit the best talent) and should now focus on tiktok like video, Snap chat mapping/tracking and their marketplace as legit competition for ebay and amazon that can carry them through until VR is ready for the mainstream...FB cant survive without the talent either way so they will have no choice to pivot back to their strengths and i'd say the odds will be high for those who buy this dip to be very happy in a few quarters.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 03:01:53'] FB is no longer growing users. FB is expecting a $10b hit from Apples new default security. Where is the growth going to come from?> This makes no sense because their VR segment is already making over $2.2 billion in revenues per year (with an appstore that brings in high profit margins) while their losses in VR will slowly decrease as their research & development matures.$2.1b in VR sales, $12.5b in VR expenses.They are growing expenses at about 60% yoy (up from 55% yoy) and growing revenue at about 100% yoy (down from 130% yoy.)It will take 3-12 years to achieve profitability, if they execute perfectly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 03:08:29'] I completely agree.    $11.8 Billion of the $14.3 Billion of earnings for Amazon came from Rivian.But Amazon has also been trading sideways for a while now so some of it might be catch up.   The other factor is the new they will increase the cost of Prime.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 03:48:00'] And that’s why I bought more shares of FB. I like to buy monopoly or duopoly’s. In the case of social media advertising, Facebook and Google are the leaders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 05:16:33'] My thoughts exactly. I'm slightly biased though as I hate amazon with a passion. Loaded up on a bit of Facebook though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 05:24:27'] Yep. I think FB is the only big tech company currently near it bottom. Sure it may drop another 10% when the market crashes, but it’s almost to its pre-pandemic trend line. All of the others that ran up on the back of $10T in new debt/market liquidity, still have a good amount of downside before equilibrium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 05:25:05'] The market is always right and you are always wrong. Don't think that is true? Argue with the market and find out what happens.The market does what it does. Whether it seems unreasonable or wrong to us it doesn't matter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 06:38:08'] Forgive me if this was mentioned far below, but what everyone here seems to be missing is the hit to FB's core business (projecting ~10 billion in revenue lost in 2022) due to Apple privacy changes (IDFA).  They won't get that money back, they need to increase/invent other revenue streams (risk).  Comparing Amazon to Facebook is kinda pointless imo, Facebook will be fine, but lots of people were expecting a negative reaction to lowered guidance for 2022.  Amazon on the other hand was just so beaten up.  It was trading at 06/2020 prices and the fundamentals have improved big time since then (revenue +55%, earnings +175%). Amazon needed horrible earnings to go any lower imo
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 06:59:28'] Yes. They got it right. FB shitco. AMZN was able to shockingly beat (even without rivian) and with labor and supply issues. They have huge pricing power in prime and AWS just prints money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 07:06:38'] I share your concerns but I bought AMZN before earnings and FB after earnings and think they’ll work out well long term.  FB is too cheap here.  Amazon is expensive but mainly because they pour a lot of money back into the business, also AWS is a fucking powerhouse.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 07:09:11'] The thing people don't seem to accept is that on any given day the market doesn't care what you or I think.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 09:45:35'] Based on financials I think you’re probably right. Based on instinct I think I agree with the market. AMZN feels safe. Their future for the moment looks secure. They have a tight grip on the culture. Facebook’s cultural presence has been waning slowly for years and they basically announced to the world that Facebook is no longer their future and they want to take the company in a new direction, probably because it’s their best chance at remaining relevant. This is risky for investors because we just don’t know how it will pan out. And on top of that I think many people aren’t thrilled by their vision of the future. Not to mention they have a really long way to go if they are gonna make the metaverse a success. I know one person with an oculus. They need massive uptake of VR headsets before it’s even plausible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 11:21:56'] Yes you are. Now go sleep.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 13:12:25'] I think you might be right about Facebook but you are also ignoring a lack of control that FB has. If android hours the way of apple they will be well and truly screwed on their main platform. I also think part of it is the meta verse stuff. Seems like absolutely no one is bullish on meta verse.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 14:03:23'] The AMZN rise was definitely a strange one. The Rivian profits were a good move, but they're a one-time thing and shouldn't really affect the stock price by more than a few dollars.FB's move made perfect sense imo. They're spending billions on a huge gamble and they just showed us how much Apple has them by the balls. Add to that the PR disaster that is their brand and the rise of TikTok with the younger audience, and you have a company that's gonna struggle to not become the next Myspace. I for one would never touch a Metaverse product by Facebook, and I know I'm not alone in that, not to mention how they have a fraction of the developers working on their platform compared to Android/iOS/Windows. If the Metaverse ever works out in the way FB is trying to make it work (and that's a big if), I'd be shocked if it didn't come from Apple, Google or MSFT.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 14:17:50'] The big report I saw, and I don’t look at fundamentals because… markets don’t care, was that Facebook active users declined for the first time ever. Add in rising negative sentiment towards Facebook’s product offerings and company, dropping value from iOS 15 privacy with Google set to launch the same thing, and a huge “pivot” to VR that many just do not care about… adds to really negative day.On Amazon, they beat EPS and “missed” revenue but really they were less than 1% off of revenue. An upstart advertising business that looks promising, a behemoth of a cloud product, and generally positive sentiment on all aspects other than warehouse worker conditions… it’s the opposite of FB.FB may have more potential with their VR pivot, but they could also flail. Amazon isn’t going to stop making money like they do in the next five years
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 14:46:49'] AMZN went up dramatically because it had dropped a long way without any good reason except that FB had also dropped.FB's drop is more about the prospect of their future growth being lower because their user numbers look like they may have peaked, and the apparent risk to their core business (ad revenues).  The market probably overreacted just because of the uncertainty in the overall market right now, but I do think that it is reasonable that investors would want a re-rating of FB's multiples downwards to reflect that lower expected growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 15:16:43'] The market already knows what you know. I’m short AMZN. See ya in three months.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 10:13:25'] Amazon is too opaque for me to understand where they're going. Their ad business is awesome. AWS is an almost perfect business. Rivian is so new, who knows? But their retail operation at this point just seems like a huge anchor to the business. They need to hire so many people, deal with so many supply chain and logistics issues that compared to the rest of Amazon, it starting to make more sense to start spinning these things all off. I'd kill to own only AWS and would love to avoid the retail operations. The biggest problem right now is that you can't own one without the other.  FB just seems like a huge regulatory risk that can't be quantified with financials. Next time they're involved in some fake news/genocide/riot scandal, I can see governments turning their attention to them again and trying to break them up/shut them down/whatever. Although "credit" to them, they've managed to survive every scandal thrown their way so far. In Myanmar alone, they played a direct, determining roll in the death of 25,000 people and the creation of 700,000 refugees and faced basically no consequence.  I don't understand Reality Labs or what they're trying to accomplish.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 19:54:02'] I don’t think they got fb wrong. It’s a growth company so guidance is what’s important. FB had terrible guidance hence the huge drop. Maybe a slight overreaction but warranted. Metaverse could make it an insane value. But that’s an unclear long term play. Right now it’s looking less and less like a growth company, thus making a P/E of 17 more reasonable. It’s probably the best value of FAANG after the drop, but lowest near term growth potential. Amazon I do think they go somewhat wrong. It’s a growth company as well and its guidance was below expectations. I’m actually surprised it rose so much on their guidance. Keep in mind Rivian was valued around ~$100 when they accounted for the unrealized gains. So next time their EPS could be lower or even negative depending on the price of rivian. Not something that matters to the stock, but it does make EPS kinda useless now unless you discount Rivian. I think Amazon is probably the worst FAANG company fundamentally. So worst value at current prices, but still decent growth prospects.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 05:18:49'] Facebook is a fad and will join Prodigy MySpace, Compuserve etc.All social media is little more than glorified bulletin boards. Tik Tok is the latest.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 07:28:52'] AMZN has a future, FB doesn't. FB is on it's way to the history pile with Myspace. There are no young people on FB anymore and half of the posts are Russian and Chinese misinformation posts. I closed my FB position last year and there is no way I would buy back in now. Companies die all of the time, even big companies. I don't think they can survive long enough to see their metaverse investment come to fruition. It is much more likely they end up being bought by MSFT or GOOG in a few years.AMZN on the other hand is poised to keep growing. 40% yoy on AWS? 32% yoy on advertising? That's where the money is. No one will even notice they are paying an extra $1.66/mo for Prime. AMZN was also due for a bump after being pretty flat last year and still getting corrected in January.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 17:56:11'] I think it got FB right and AMZN wrong. FB's report was the worst I've ever seen from a megacap, and they absolutely deserved the share price plummet. Management has lost their focus on the core apps at a time when competition from Tik Tok and headwinds with ad blockers and shifting consumer behavior favoring lower monetizing videos vs. feeds/stories are bigger fundamental threats to the company than ever before. Instead of honing in and using all their might to fight back, management decided to gamble on an unproven, universally panned idea in the metaverse.AMZN report was better than FB but still pretty awful. They missed on revenue and they reported bad guidance for next quarter, well under analysts expectations. They only beat on earnings because of a one-time windfall from RIVN. The stock had performed much worse than FB lately so more was priced in, but still, double digit gain made no sense to me and I fully expect the gap to fill.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 05:16:22'] AMZN price has been stagnant for almost a year despite them posting multiple double digit gains quarter over quarter. I wouldn’t be surprised if Amazon has a breakout from these levels to the upside.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 08:25:39'] Guidance was weak so I think bad earnings are already priced in. The question is how the guidance for Q2 and maybe the rest of the year will look like, esp for AWS. I feel that people are not too worried about the retail side of the business (if sales decline due to people spending less) since there is not serious competition and things will get back to normal once people start spending more. But if AWS slows down that might be a sign that Google and Microsoft and maybe other smaller players are taking market share.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 08:36:59'] Last earnings were great,pandemia was also weak at that time,i think people changed their habbit ,online shooping is a regular thing now.Amzn will keep momentum in my opinion.Anyways the biggest concern with Nasdaq is post pandemic earnings.If big tech companies prove that they are still lot profitable in current conditions, Nasdaq will return very positively.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 07:01:33'] Apple, Amazon, and (probably) Google are still long term growth stocks. AMZN has become a multi-national tech conglomerate  at this point. When one part of its business is down, there’s usually others which are profitable. That being said can’t say how earnings this quarter will be compared to expectations. But the company is not going anywhere anytime soon. I think tech overall will remain more volatile due to rising interest rates though, at least short/medium term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 07:04:15'] Earnings will be good but the outlook will be disappointing. But still one of the best companies to invest in the long term. Many sources of revenue, lots of future plans in many segments. Long term Rivian can make a lots of money - different segment of electric cars compare to tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 10:34:09'] I think it's clear that Amazon is the number one online retailer on the planet, on top of the government contracts, cloud contracts, etc, so that should answer your own question as to how they will do in the long run. For me the long run could be 2 quarters/6 months or it could be 10 years. Depends on if I think I can make some kind of medium term quarterly swing trade. I'd just buy, hold amazon, and then never even look at it again other to buy more on a dip whenever it's taking a hit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 22:09:04'] Buying the biggest companies in the world has historically not been a winning strategy over the long term, no matter how impenetrable their moats are at the moment. (I'm sure someone will share that graphic of the top market cap companies over time) The amount of runway for $1T, $2T companies just doesn't compare to what is possible with $500M, $10B market cap companies. I don't want to just buy the past winners, but buy the future ones. This is why the core strategy of my portfolio are large tilts to small cap (value) stocks, which is both riskier but also has higher rewards in the long run. They are also a hedge when big tech hits a wall, like happened post-Dot Com. [Take a look at 2000-1](https://i.imgur.com/xIpUKyL.png) in this table of small cap value versus the broader market in down years.I like buying big tech 'tactically', as they do have rock solid balance sheets and moats, so when they do dip (irrationally), I buy them. This rewarded me greatly in 2022, as I doubled down on - GOOG (+25%, 2% of port.)- META (+60%, 2.6% of port.)- MSFT (+17%, 2.8% of port.)- AAPL (+19%, 1.9% of port.)- SMH (+24%, 1.4% of port)- AMD (+12%, 2.5% of port.)Yes I didn't time the bottom perfectly or I'd be much richer. I had opened up positions on these in 2021-2, and either averaged down from expensive levels or bought when I felt was too cheap. AMD/MSFT were among my worst timed purchases. But these are not necessarily long term holds since I already have exposure through index funds and I think they are fairly to over-valued now.

Big money can sell their shares at any moment causing huge price swings and can leave investors holding the bag the next day when market opens. Atleast it gives everyday investors some options.As for the gambling aspect people who trade stocks in general are gambling. They're going to gamble regardless with their stocks, panic selling, panic buying, etc. Long term investors aren't going to use this feature much.

Stock Splits are a marketing maneuver, aimed at making a high-priced stocks more attractive to retail investors, who might consider buying it. Stock splits also make options contracts more affordable for retail investors.\n* My prediction is that Amazon will also be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Apple, announced a 7-for'

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-13 14:27:35'] I think Amazon's a solid company to invest into still. They spend billions growing the company as opposed to making maximum profit and reducing their price to earning ratio. I can see a few bad upcoming earnings but long term I think they are going to keep growing. They are overdue a price increase after a ear of stagnation

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 14:12:51'] Worth mentioning that the Rivian investment was valued at their Dec 31 price. In their upcoming Q, it will have to be adjusted for the end of Q1 prices. This was a 'beat' but outside of their one-off line item with their Rivian investment and the insane AWS growth, I wouldn't call this an impressive quarter for Amazon. I do like the fact that they are increasing their prime membership price. Seemed inevitable with everything rising in prices across the board. Long-term, Amazon will do fine. But this wasn't a good quarter, relatively speaking. Analyst estimates were already low because Amazon warned of higher costs the previous Q.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 08:39:13'] I think part of their way to deal with this will be to increase delivery times, and charge more for what we are getting now. 5 years is time enough to raise the yearly fee (a few times), and also to slow down the time between order placed and actual delivery.Just like food companies shrink product before raising prices, amz will start charging extra for the "speed" they provide today. While everything else gets relegated to slower delivery times as the default.Recessions always attract people to jobs that they wouldn't normally put up with. I think if they demand less from their workers, they may be able to keep finding people desperate enough to put up with their crap.Recession means desperate workers, less  people buying stuff, less workers needed to fulfill orders. It will probably work out well for them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-27 19:11:44'] I dont think folks understand what Amazon does and how AWS happened. Amazon is about leveraging tech and unlike most companies they actually have the tech and retail expertise to make it happen.[https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/22/amazon-debuts-a-fully-autonomous-warehouse-robot/](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/22/amazon-debuts-a-fully-autonomous-warehouse-robot/)A few other companies are working on warehouse automation as well. Check Berkshire Grey which seems to be getting more and more involved with Fedex but at the cost of huge dilution at low price (around $1.50 I believe). The upside is this partnership can make them a lot of money but the downside risk is Fedex might just buy them out on the cheap before they can grow. They are going to face liquidity problems soon so Fedex might be able to force their hand.Symbiotic Inc is another recent one though Im not buying at that price. I want to see more earnings. That said Walmart is a big shareholder.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 09:43:51'] I like AMZN personally, but it's not without risk. My biggest fear is that cloud services are more of a commodity than people realise. I'm sure AWS will always demand a premium, but if other providers continue to undercut AWS there may come a point at which AWS margins need to decline to remain competitive. Declining margins would really hurt the valuation as right now the prices they're able to charge are frankly ridiculous and as it stands I'd guess AWS is around 70-80% of their valuation .I think you should at least sell half and put it in something else, ideally an ETF if you're not sure where to put it. 50% in just AMZN is a lot even if you're very bullish on the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 11:28:37'] Personally, no matter how convinced I am, I don’t go beyond 15% of my total portfolio in a single position. Even that is a lot and I wouldn’t do that initially; it would be the result of doubling down.

I plan to relook at them some time in the future since I have a few other methods and more metrics I can take from their 10ks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 22:32:11'] 50% Amazon is way too much. You don't have to sell all of it, but it's probably wise to move some of it into VOO in order to reduce your risk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 12:41:56'] I think Amazon is undervalued. Their web services alone is insane. They have so many streams from web to books to prime to, you know, Amazon.I know it's 3k, 1.6t, but still.Google is really the same for me. Cloud, ads, Android, innovation. Lots there as well.Compared to Apple at 3t, I think these are both good buys and I know Google is splitting soon and I can't help but think Amazon will as well All that to say, I don't think I'd sell either right now I'd rather sell something else to buy either Disclaimer: I teach grade 7 and have no idea what I'm talking about in any professional manner.I'm buying both though. More Google now since I want to get before the split
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 12:50:01'] You’re basically asking if GOOG or AMZN is a better investment in the short term (1-3 years) and nobody knows for sure otherwise they would be rich and wouldn’t be telling anyone. I would just adjust so you have equal amounts of both, which would be pretty safe. Or you can adjust based on conviction, so if you think GOOG is more likely to have a breakout sooner you can have 75% GOOG 25% AMZN for example.I have also been waiting for an AMZN breakout and I think ill add some more GOOG cuz I do think the split will act as a catalyst. But its always important to remember nothing is for certain and it can easily easily be wrong

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-18 04:22:25'] Not at all.  I do think people should own the big four, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon.  But I like Google the best of the group.Google is growing faster than the others but yet is cheaper.   Plus going to do a 20:1 split.   They should also be joining the DJ.  Both are bullish.But the biggest reason is Google has a massive runway built on all their assets yet to be fully moentized.Plus Google is going to start trying to make ad tracking more inefficient on Android like Apple has done on iOS.This will benefit Google as it will push more ad budgets to Search.  With search there is no need to tracking as users are willing to share what is on their minds.I do think you want to buy now and before the split.   With the Ukraine news yesterday it makes for a great entry point with Google.   It could be we will never see Google this cheap again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 10:34:14'] I personally would not. Amazon is better long term due to diversification. So if your plan is to hold for decades and possibly pass it on to future gens, then stick to Amazon. Its a lot safer. Thats not to say it will outperform Google over that stretch but its less likely to become obsolete. Further did you see that ad growth in 2021? Holy cow... Ads are probably going to overtake their subscription segment (Prime) by next Q and at that pace, it can overtake AWS in a few years. The privacy changes with Apple and Google will likely drive even more ads over to Amazon as well. They have tons of room to grow in that segment.

Generally in bear markets I've learned to stay away from tech or anything that ever gets into the news or social media. Not that it's impossible to make money on them, I just hate the increased volatility.Take NVDA, they had a good quarter, guidance is also OK (a bit lower margins but still ok). You'd expect it to move sideways. They took a 7% drop on opening. Nothing's ever "priced in" in a bear market, just a bunch of panicky people and very tightly tweaked algos.

POST_TEXT: b'Is this a stupid move? Ive got a number of tech stocks that are down significantly, and feel that theyll will continue to slide down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 09:45:14'] Brah if anyone here knew that we wouldn’t be here
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 08:16:50'] AMZN has been falling harder than most.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 08:24:27'] Why would you park your money in to companies who are facing supply chain crisis and possibly lower demand in the up coming months due to inflated prices of goods and destruction of consumer demands. Why do you think shares prices of those two company are going down? It’s because market is pricing in what I said and not to mention if some one farts on their earning call stock will drop like a dead fly before you can react. Look at Nflx what happened after their earning. If you have to sell everything else then hold cash and buy spy qqq near the bottom or just find better companies which have lower downsides
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 08:24:18'] I'm not sure about SHOP, but AMZN is and will be a buy.  Based on the amount of money you have to invest,  I'd buy 1 share of Amazon each month (dollar cost average for at least 6 or so months).   After that you will be invested in AMZN at a good base price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 10:20:16'] Personally, I think an even safer bet is to diversify amongst the largest companies. I'd put it into Amazon, as well as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Salesforce, Google to name a few

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 12:41:04'] Amazon is the best bet . Shop is good too but too new for certainty

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 14:10:47'] Yes, your money is safe with Amazon. Not sure about shop, but amazon is here to stay, def not going anywhere, and only going to get bigger. Don't understand the comments here claiming amazon is going down lol but big surprise is awaiting them end of this year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 17:20:47'] You’re selling the companies based off thinking they’re gonna keep going down vs the companies themselves actually changing and becoming bad companies… just buy good companies and keep buying them forever

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 08:18:43'] both are trendy and overvalued, I wouldn't go all-in for either. companies in the top 10 today rarely stay in the top 10 for more than a decade. 30 years ago lots of people bet the house on General Electric, Sears, and General Motors thinking those companies would be dominant in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 17:16:05'] You have 30k bro do some research and find a smaller company that will actually make you a return worth having. 30k into Amazon is jack shit. You need the valuation to go to 4T just to make 30k. Find something worth investing in. You need millions to invest like the big dudes into things like Amazon since your so late to the party
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 13:28:39'] I think Amazon has somewhere between a $400-800 drop left. I will start nibbling if it drops $400 which it probably will after earnings.Shopify could easily get cut in half from here. I would start adding in the $500-$600 range however.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:37:47'] Or you could have just held since there is nothing wrong with the companies and they will bounce back eventually. If anything, you could have averaged down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:01:29'] I am not a fan of individual stock investing, but the chances of Google, Apple, and Microsoft coming back to previous highs at some point is probably in the 99% zone.  They own 90% of all the market share of OS for computers and cell phones so how would they not eventually retrace? Now will they outperform and index fund over one's lifetime is less likely, but getting back to where they were before is near certain.If I was the OP I would put all of my money in those 3 (since they love tech) or VTI and stop thinking about it.Think it was the great economist Irving Fisher who said (paraphrasing), "It is the duty of the of equity investor to endure losses from time to time and to do it without reproach of their investing plan."

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:22:02'] I agree with your decision unlike most people on that sub. Here's why:Stocks like AAPL used to trade with a PE of 12. It is still trading with a PE of 23. I am not saying it will go to 12, but it might go to 16/17.FED will start the quantitative tightening next month removing 9T of its balance sheet every month. It's gonna be the opposite of printing money. That 9T is just the start, it might be more in the future.Corporate investors are 80% of the market. They now have access to better bonds unlike during Covid. They can have a really good bond giving 5% return with low risk. Those insitutional investors prefer a 5% safe over a risky 15%. So the bond market is now taking investments that was previously in the stock market.I still don't see a crash for the stock market however.

POST: ['2023-06-14 22:00:44'] POST TITLE: b"How Shopify ($SHOP) 'shape shift' made e-commerce firm attractive again"
POST_TEXT: b'E-commerce software and services provider Shopify ($SHOP) suddenly looks a lot different to investors in the wake of a strategy shift. Canada-based Shopify in early June completed the sale of its fulfillment unit, easing investor angst over rising investments for SHOP stock.\r  \n\r  \nWith the move, Canada-based Shopify slashed capital spending and improved its financial outlook.\r  \n\r  \n"Post the recent \'shape shift\' where it exited the logistics business and reduced over 20% of the workforce, the company is free cash flow positive," said UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar in a recent report.\n\n  \n**Covid Emergency E-Commerce Boost**\r  \nFurther, Shopify stock has jumped 90% in 2023 as of June 14. Shopify stock has gained 42% since the company announced the sale of the fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 07:15:13'] I have some shares in Shop, some bought a few years ago, and some bought near the peak. But I still don't know what to do with them.As someone who runs a small mostly online e-comm business, I think it's a great platform, probably the best option for most small and medium size businesses. But I still don't know how valuable a company it is.As I see it there's 3 categories of e-comm companies1. Small startups or mom n pop stores that want an online presence2. Established or Mid-size e-comm companies3. Large e-comm companies and established brands or B&M storesI think that group 1 seems to be Shopify's biggest target market, but I see that as being doomed to fail, as 90% of those companies won't be able to make money online when they realise that the biggest challenge and cost online isn't the platform/ website design, it's marketing and getting people on to your site.Group 2 - this is where Shopify may succeed long term - BUT those companies will be looking for better pricing as they grow. Shopify isn't cheap on payment processing fees for example, even on their expensive tiers. As other platforms improve (e.g. BigCommerce), I suspect Shopify will become engaged in a race to the bottomGroup 3 - These companies care less about Shopify's ease of set up etc.. and they probably don't like being tied in with a company with less flexibility, who will have all their own policies etc.. They have more options available to them (Magento, Drupal, Bigcommerce). Larger companies will be more heavily focused on price, flexibility etc.. which aren't Shopify's biggest strong points.Shopify has been doing a big marketing push bragging about how easy it is to set up a store with them. However, most of those startup store owners will discover how little benefit that really is in the highly competitive online world, where it's all about visibility and marketing. **Having a nice looking website is no longer the hard part.** I suspect long term, more and more traffice (and revenue) will go through the big stores and marketplaces. As soon as a small startup succeeeds - they'll start looking to migrate from Shopify to save money and have more flexibility
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 17:40:01'] Shopify is booting lots of retailers right now to the point bigcommerce us picking up clients and referring to themselves as the place for shopify refugees. You can't start a business on shopify and be confident theybwont destroy your business. This is bad for shopifybif it becomes more widespread or known about. To be clear were not talking about shopify payments were talking about shopify acting like ebay or Amazon dictating what legal products you can and can't sell

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-20 19:34:57'] I don't actually like Amazons core product. It is an incredible service and it is no doubt HIGHLY profitable, but it is like me investing in Tobacco or Missiles... I wouldn't, even if it made me lots of money.It promotes overconsumption, unnecessary retail spending, and it kills small businesses with creative business owners. I love and have always LOVED Google. Honestly, I can't believe that I don't own the stock yet. I feel that they are positioned BEAUTIFULLY for the future, and that their offerings will mature a lot more in the years to come (Googles upward trend is possibly just getting started!).Every single retail business in the entire world will be shifting into Amazon's space in the next 1-3 years, and while they will continue to grow, this segment of their business will become less and less unique, as competition will ramp up IMMENSELY and all physical retail stores will start to be replaced by e-commerce stores with similar offerings.Both are great stocks, but I prefer to hold Temple & Webster in Australia as my e-commerce play, as I really love their offerings and ethos, and for the EV / space play in all-in on Tesla... So Amazon doesn't fit into my portfolio. Google. Triple thumbs up. I'll be in very soon.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-20 12:02:51'] Buy both,  there's this thing called fractional shares if you're broke. Amzn goes up 20% that's 20% gain whether you have 1 share or one tenth.

So, a bad earnings could be partially priced in with this decline. \n\nSecond, AMZN blew earnings last quarter (Q3 '21) when they had a 59.4% decline in Net Income forcing a small sell off back in Oct of last year.  Now, their expectations are 50% lower than they were in Q4 of '20 ($7 EPS vs. $3.67 EPS for this quarter) so much of their slower growth/high transport cost has been priced in. \n\nThird, their stock is already down nearly 26% from its November high, so the likelihood of another massive correction like we saw with FB/NFLX is unlikely since investors have already sold off.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 11:54:33'] Playing with earnings right now is playing with fire. If I was you I would play after earnings. Especially since you aren’t a major institution with inside information. This is serious shit man. Amazon’s guidance will make or break the market tomorrow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 12:58:57'] Most of your points are “Stock is already down so there is no way it will drop more”. Just look at PYPL and NFLX, there is no bottom when growth has slowed down and weak guidance in the future.That being said, as someone who is long on AMZN and QQQ, it better goes up
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 11:16:59'] Naw you're just trying to sell your overpriced calls before earnings tank. Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 12:22:32'] My prediction: Underwhelming earnings.They already mentioned higher costs eating into their profits and a supply chain issue. How strong was their holiday quarter? TBD but I don't think it will meet expectations.Their AWS cloud has been the most positive thing for Amazon in their recent quarters. That's always a good sign. Their AWS is responsible for 54% of their operating income while only adding 13% of revenue. My issue with Amazon is their e-commerce business might be too problematic for them in future earnings with competition increasing and lots of labor issues regarding wages. I personally think they have their hands on too many projects that investors aren't sure will be profitable, yet. Long-term, it's tough to bet against Amazon. Short-term, I would not be surprised if it gets bumpy. They should raise their prime prices, too. Inevitably, it will happen, anyways.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 13:35:41'] Soaring in after hours, even though they missed on revenue and their guidance was also a miss. What's going on here?

POST: ['2022-04-22 06:27:57'] POST TITLE: b'If a growth company, such as GOOG or AMZN, said that they were done growing and just want to pay dividends now, what would happen?'
POST_TEXT: b"How do you think that would play out? Considering how profitable they are currently and how much they can afford to pay out to shareholders, would you stay invested in a growth stock like this if they were done dumping their profits into growing more rapidly and instead just wanted to pay their shareholders?   \n\n\nI'm assuming that this is the end goal for every growth company. If you disagree, why?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 09:16:50'] Both GOOG and AMZN have spent money on stock buybacks, which are very similar to dividends in that they are a way of returning capital to shareholders. Stock buybacks are just more tax efficient for individual shareholders. Stock buybacks are also seen as less of a long term commitment(cutting a dividend is more likely to upset shareholders than reducing the rate of stock buybacks).
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 06:50:51'] They could initiate a dividend and keep growing. Doesn’t have to be either or.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 07:37:02'] you see what happened to netflix and fb.  as soon as they show sign of stagnation the stock tanked.  wouldnt surprise me if apple or microsoft valuation halved if they show sign of decline.  google already have fairly low pe so probably wont drop so much
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 15:34:30'] They would probably drop to around a 8-12 PE ratio.  That is more typical of profitable companies with limited growth, and so pay out a healthy dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 17:31:17'] I'll rather have buybacks
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 20:36:44'] Pretty huge difference between the two.  Google FCF over the last three years2018    $22 billion2019    $31 billion2020    $42 billion2021    $67 billionSee the trend and the amounts?  Versus Amazon2018    $19 billion2019    $26 billion2020    $31 billion2021    $-9 billionSo Google with a dividend would be just incredible and not nearly as much with Amazon.But honestly buybacks are far more tax efficient.  Plus I much rather have as you can then time the taxable event where with a dividend you can not.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 23:10:33'] The stock would either tank or rise a bit. Depends on the context. But paying dividends has nothing to do with companies being unable to grow.Matter of fact, dividends are a kind of faith in growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 16:19:05'] Nobody is addressing the actual question. What would happen if a growth company decided to stop growing and just pay dividends? Well, there would be a quick, steep stock price decline. By stating they will no longer grow, they could no longer be priced as a growth company with high valuation multiples. They would need to be repriced as a value company. AMZN’s P/E ratio of 44 would need to be repriced to something similar to AT&T’s P/E of 7. Properly repricing  AMZN’s closing price today of $2,887 to the new P/E of 7 would give you a new price of $459 per share. Not a good look!  Not a good move by AMZN!
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 06:30:49'] They would have less capital to reinvest in innovation. I would sell it all if that happened
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 09:34:39'] something like this likely wouldn't come as a shock to investors. there would be signs of slowing growth, and the stock would likely get valued without high cash flow growth going forward. but, as some other people have said here, dividend payments with slowing growth isn't a death sentence unless guidance is cut way beyond analyst expectations
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-22 17:14:10'] I want to buy google down here but to dollar cost average into s stock this big is tough
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 02:20:17'] Depends on what kind of growth they are expected to have, likely quite a bit of selling will happen as growth is priced in those stocks.I don't own GOOGL anymore as I sold in January but I do own AMZN, if it announced it stops growing then I would sell and look for a different growth stock.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 09:48:52'] Don’t sell.Amazon entered 2021 with plenty of big growth opportunities. This included plans to expand its virtual health care program across the U.S. (Amazon Care). It is also expanding its prescription drug business (Amazon Pharmacy). They also introduced a plethora of consumer electronics gadgets, including smart displays and a home robot (Astro).Amazon moved sideways this year whilst the other big tech stocks all showed nice levels of growth.In 2022, there are lots of reasons to be optimistic that their share price will rise.

Cell phone addiction will continue to spread into third-world countries until every person in the world owns a smartphone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:54:40'] Amazon is a great investment. You will have a very hard time finding a better place to invest your money. That said, do it anyway. 40% in amazon is far to much exposure. While very unlikely a single stock black swan event would be devastating. I'd drop half that stock and put into whatever broad market etf you like.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 12:13:47'] Rebalance if you have another stock you think might be a winner. Don’t do it all at once though, slow and steady and according to conviction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 13:07:28'] I have two plans: one is to buy 4% (25 stocks) and sell down to 5% when one reaches 6% (plus the difference from actual to all-time high of the SP500). This is for dividend stocks and I call it the market dividend. This happens quiet a lot with cyclical stocks and is mostly OK, helps to gain from those waves.Now a stock like **Amazon I would put in the second plan**. There I sell the original invested amount when the stock reaches a plus of 500%, then again when it reaches +1000% and so on. You still keep a lot of this stock but get a nice cashflow out of it. This year I had 3 stocks that reached the 500% barrier, nice year.But then I have to say that I live in Switzerland and there is no private capital gain tax here.

Given AMZN didn’t go anywhere past year, it’s ripe for breakout and move ⬆️
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 16:23:44'] Is it 40% of your net worth or 40% of one portfolio with other assets there to offset it? If it's the former then how big is your portfolio? If it's under $100k I probably would just start investing elsewhere to diversify. If you're over $500k and it's in a taxable account then you should probably talk to a fiduciary, a position of that size exposes you to a lot of risk that's probably unnecessary. It may be good to diversify into other sectors.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 11:12:03'] Depends entirely on your conviction on Amazon. I'm 50% Tesla and nothing would be a worse decision for me than rebalancing away from Tesla, because it's the company I know most about by far and I know what they're headed towards. Anything else would be way more risky for me.Better to have a lot of money in one company you truly understand than 10 you only know the bare essentials of.That said, I'm not adding to my position either.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 19:42:53'] If it were me I'd sell off ~10-15% of my profit and put it in growth stocks. I don't see Amazon being a huge growth stock compared to some other holdings I have in the future but that's just my opinion and they may do 20% next year and prove me wrong. It's really hard to answer this without knowing your long term goals and general investment strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 20:04:20'] I would put some of that into big tech focused index, like QQQ, to better diversify but keep the tilt of big tech. As likely at least one of the AMZN or GOOG or MSFT will underperform the SP500, so diversify to make sure you don't lose out on good returns.

Many companies are already looking at shorting AMZN and converting their shares into something more innovative, like GOOGL or MSFT. I personally rotated from 3700 and will re-enter if it falls below 3000, but not touching it yet. The term 'long-term winner' is bs. You had a stock that is flat during the biggest bull run this year pretty much. It rose way less compared to other FAANG stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 13:15:46'] You should open a modest position, one stock, half stock, whatever is comfortable.Every 8-10% down, you can increase your position. That's what I'm doing and I'm a total newbie who will never be able to tell the bottom and invest 100%  within seconds.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:22:41'] To answer your question at face value, I personally think it will keep dropping beyond Friday (but like you said, nothing is certain and no one can time the market). Firstly, overall market is correcting hard right now and AMZN does tend to trend with the S&P. Secondly they fell very short on earnings a couple weeks ago and they've racked up huge losses due to their large stake in Rivian, so I would say higher chance than not Amazon continues to trade lower for the forseeable future.But ultimately you do have to ask yourself why you're buying AMZN, or why you're buying into the market at all. If you're in for short term gains and a 10% drop would keep you up at night, I'd put your money elsewhere (or just hold cash tbh). If you believe in the company and think it will go up long term and don't plan on selling in the near term, then it doesn't really matter if it goes up or down a few percent by Friday, does it?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:46:59'] Markets been in a large correction period for months. It will go down beyond Friday. I'd wait til you see recovery trends suggesting a sense of stability.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 21:31:19'] Investment for such short time in one stock is never good decision.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 22:00:14'] Just because it hasn’t dipped that low since 2020 doesn’t mean it can’t go lower.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 07:31:51'] Q: I have $6000 to spend which I won’t need until a year later. I’m also a relatively new investor, so here’s my thinking…    Amazon closed at $2879.56 on Friday, and it’s at a discounted price. In fact it hasn’t dipped this low since 2020. It’s a pretty volatile stock, but that also puts potential for high reward! Google on the other hand is commonly known to be a long- term investment.    Which one to go with?      A: Never invest money you can't soon afford to lose.    The goal of investing is to beat inflation and not lose money.    Your best investment always depends on how long you can wait for its return.  To maximize your chance of success, match each investment to its time horizon.    One-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 have averaged 9.9% since 1989; 79% of one-year returns beat inflation.  However, over 17% of one-year returns were losses; the worst one was -46% between March 2008 and March 2009.  It would taken nearly seven years to recover from such a large loss if the average 10% growth then resumed.    Conservative assets are not productive for long time horizons.    Risky assets are not appropriate for short time horizons.    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*    GOOG has doubled over the past 18 months, but has now dropped below its 200-d moving average and is threatening a death cross.  But the fundamentals still look good, the balance sheet is solid, and the current valuation is fair.  Once the Fed makes its first rate hike in March, the worst of the market reset will be over.  Assuming a time horizon of 3 years or more, I might buy up to 5% GOOG in my portfolio on a pullback and let time work for me.    AMZN doubled in 2020 and was flat in 2021.  It has much higher P/E multiple and earnings are much less predictable.  Not especially thrilling.  In any case, the same 5% maximum limit per stock would apply here for proper diversification.    \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*    Over the past 30 years and more, the prescription to avoid losses and make money in stocks was to hold them as investments long enough to overcome short-term fluctuations and reap long-term compounded returns.      If you liked this comment, please upvote and help me build more Karma.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 13:25:30'] I’d go with GOOG
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 11:14:02'] Both are great long term investments. Amazon has a retail empire no one yet has managed to compete with. Last year they doubled down on fulfillment while others have been struggling to keep up (looking at you Shopify). Also AWS of course, another empire that only few can compete with (Google is one of them). As for their multiples, I prefer focusing on p/s with Amazon and it's very reasonable at 3.5. As for Google. I really like them because a lot of their businesses are things you cannot live without, and they have little competition. Search of course but even Gmail, Maps, YouTube, and the like. That's only in the consumer space. They also have a lot going on in enterprise (GCP, Gmail, GMeet, etc). So to summarize, don't choose one. Go with both. But don't expect amazing returns like in the last 5 years. These will eventually become value plays.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 05:27:19'] Hopefully you bought some GOOG. And hopefully AmZn follows auit
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 21:34:08'] If I had to choose between these two I'd choose GOOG. But I'd be thinking about VIAC the entire time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 22:20:16'] AAPL
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 02:10:42'] I like AMZN better, although GOOG isn't a bad stock at this price. Personally I think Amazon has more going for them between ecommerce, physical stores, AWS, streaming, Alexa, and all the other stuff they do. I know GOOG has a lot of stuff going on too, but the dominance of AWS is really want I love about Amazon. Literally every company I've worked at for the last 6-7 years has used AWS.Google's pretty solid though. They're well diversified in terms of their products, but almost all of their revenue still comes from advertising. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does make them more vulnerable to legislation or technology changes that make tracking and advertising more difficult. YouTube is probably my favourite thing about Google. Every kid I know loves YouTube and I think it still has a lot of room to grow as a platform.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 23:16:15'] I'd bet on Google.. AMZN is facing a talent crisis due to its cutthroat workplace environment. Employees are leaving in droves for greener pastures..

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 21:34:14'] Both of these are great long term, but anything can happen in a year especially with interest hikes. I put some of my short term money in stable coin and collect between 8 to 10% intrest. But this also has its risk that is why I only hold some cash there.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 18:29:12'] The answer is both (or just do QQQ). But, one things people are overlooking in this thread is that GOOG is facing much stronger regulatory headwinds (both parties are going after FB+GOOG). Also Google’s revenue is way more concentrated on one industry (ads), which is a risk in this environment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 18:45:38'] GOOG, it has announced that it will do stock split in the middle of the year. No retail to drag it down like AMZN, which hasn't pay dividend, stock split, nor share buyback since 1999.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-31 04:59:32'] To echo others, if you need it a year later than just put it into a savings account and get pennies of interest instead. If you want to do a long term investment instead, neither. Both GOOG and AMZN lack a dividend, the most powerful way to grow wealth, and at best any returns you'd get would be from selling the ticker. GOOG has never done a stock split and AMZN last did a split in 1999.Neither are bad companies though, there are just much better places for money to be put to work.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 21:44:14'] I would buy $CAT, $BP, $SONY, $HPC, $DE, VZ or countless other stocks before $AAPL or $AMZN right now.  This idea that tech is a safe haven is fools gold.  Take your weekly/monthly expenses for example.  Do you spend more cash a month on tech? Or energy? Or food? Or transportation? Or clothes? Why should tech be valued higher than every other index combined? Technology is going nowhere and will constantly improve but it valued at such nose bleed levels.  Even Apple and Amazon are overpriced.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 08:51:25'] If you are only torn between those two, then Amazon, easily. It is undervalued, unlike Apple which is overvalued at the moment. Besides, Amazon stock has been stale for over a year, while the company invested huge ammounts of capital in itself, so now is a great time to take advantage of this before the stock price catches up to the company's true value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 16:54:39'] I own both. If I was buying right now I would lean towards Amazon. I don't think you can go wrong with either one over the long term.

POST_TEXT: b'Etrade has a note about amzn that says " Amazon will have a stock split that is effective Monday, June 6, 2022. Some open orders placed prior to the split may be canceled. If your order is canceled, you can place the order again, noting the new share price. Please note, new closing (sell) orders may be placed starting Sunday, June 5, 2022, after split processing is completed. " Does that mean no selling shares until after the split?

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-31 17:42:02'] It just means if you have an open order at the time of the split it will get cancelled. This is for your benefit so you don't accidentally buy or sell at pre-split prices.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 15:42:05'] My strategy is to keep buying GOOGL for at least the next 5 years. Split or not.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 16:00:40'] Bought a ton of shares of both last week. Holding.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 20:03:34'] GOOG is going to shock earnings. YouTube ads have been insane lately. Tons of unskippable ads and double ads. Plus facebook rates have crashed and lots of people going to Google. I’m buying calls for earnings, it will pump 10% on earnings
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 17:41:02'] Calls, obviously.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 19:35:46'] How do you take advantage of a spilt? Mathematically it doesn't increase the price, so I guess I don't get how any options strategy changes that?

It led the way for usability in web design, the customer service was unbelievable and 9/10 times it was the cheapest option. I also wanted to invest in cloud computing, so amzn seemed a good fit. \n\nI feel the shopping experience has changed. The flood of third party sellers has had a negative impact on the usability. Prices are usually cheaper elsewhere. Prime's 'next day delivery' seems to have become two days, which was the old standard free delivery. \n\nI still believe in amazon, but would like some other opinions on wheather or not its a hold.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 10:24:03'] Do you think Amazon is done growing and is there a better opportunity in the market that you want to invest in? If yes, sell. For me it's a resounding no as Amazon continues to take market share and create new growth verticals
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 14:24:40'] I personally like GOOGL and MSFT better, but I don’t think Amazon is done growing either. I hold all 3, it feels like Amazon is stagnant for months on end, and then goes parabolic (as parabolic as a mega cap will go at least)

Amazon is and will be one of the strongest players in the new era of connected technologies and Web 3.0
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 11:03:27'] This was the sign I needed to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 10:31:16'] I wouldn’t get rid of AMZN. I don’t think that would be a smooth move at all. Amazon has a lot of ambition and growth in the future as technology continues to expand/change at an exponential rate.

It's still a monster and it is very hard to see a scenario where it isn't for a long time. Sorry that this isn't exactly a technical rationale; Personally I added a little recently, but probably won't again for a while--but I definitely am not selling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 12:06:55'] I think you’re dead on with retail side of things.  Anecdotally, as someone who spent close to 10k/year on Amazon, my shopping habit has been changing.  Walmart and Target is usually 30-50% cheaper on most things so I’m migrating there for everyday things.  For any expensive electronics I just go to best buy after getting inundated with counterfeit or refurbished laptops, tablets, etc sold as new.  Just too much hassle.  And any personal hygiene items are mostly fake on Amazon.  I gave up after buying several norelco replacement shaver head using an Amazon link from philips website and still getting provably fake stuff.  Just not worth risking my own safety/health.Besides, the pandemic is ending and the demand for online purchase will probably reset to 2019 levels and there’s the supply chain / inflation issue Amazon is very prone to..  I think their continued growth will come from cloud computing side of things.   But Microsoft and Google is competing quite fiercely so it remains to be seen how profitable they’ll continue to be.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 10:50:22'] You're focusing on one part of their business - ecommerce. And you're using personal, anecdotal experience, assuming that you can extrapolate that over an entire market, using only one data point - your own experiences.You're also ignoring the AWS, Prime Video, and other service lines that might dramatically outperform (and provide a greater expected return on your 2018 investment) their ecommerce business, if your investment thesis proves correct over the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 11:52:31'] I believe, that of all tech mega cap giants..MSFT, GOOG and TSLA are better to hold than AAPL, FB and AMZN at the moment
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 15:29:56'] I sold 1/3 of my Amazon shares to put into some other ventures. I got tired of it moving sideways. I always compare to the S&P, if a single stock in my portfolio is underperforming the S&P, I would be better off with a simple index fund. Maybe something to consider, instead of selling all your Amazon, just sell a percentage.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 15:19:54'] I’d sell. Rich valuation, going to face increasing competition on the only thing actually making them profitable, AWS, and I absolutely agree that their original product, the amazon subscription, is not nearly as high quality and customer focused as it once was. I don’t think it’s a company that’s going away anytime soon, of course not, but there’s a lot of room for new competition to do a better job as it seems Amazon is being crushed under its own weight, and bad rep especially in an incredibly tight low skill labor market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 20:39:00'] Amazon needs to do a split. Thats literally the only thing that will serve as a positive catalyst for their shareprice at the moment.I know some of the old school boomers detest the idea, since they like the feeling of superiority. But the truth is this is the price of having a ridiculously priced shareprice.I dont see them ever doing it though. Since Amazon has a hard salary cap of 160k , stock options is the only way they are able to hire and retain talent.The last thing they would want is to jeopardize the stability of this mechanism because doing so would make their stock based compensation less stable and less secure, ultimately requiring them to dilute their bottom line by paying employee's more.&#x200B;When you finally come to grips with the realization that owning Amazon stock is a way to subsidize amazon employee's, you'll find your answer.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-13 15:54:42'] Amazon is practically ingrained into public life at this point.Amazon is widely diversified, they have diversified into their own grocery store (Amazon Fresh), their own streaming services for music and video, with their own originals too, also have a foot in the door with the smart home market with Amazon Alexa, there's also Audible and so much more. Not even mentioning AWS. Loads of businesses even use Amazon's storefront, small and large. By branching them all under the Amazon name, the public essentially have an all-in-one place to go to do their online shopping. While their workers rights aren't the greatest, also have perfected the consumer's greed with prime and their next day delivery, people really would rather throw money at an Amazon Prime subscription than wait an extra few days.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 04:54:48'] Today's Points of Return on Bloomberg is good. Seems the tbill spread that was noticed last week was debt ceiling hedging. Due to the tax season pulling in 29% less than last year,  x day for the debt default is sooner than anticipated, early June.As a politics wonk who follows that area about as much as stocks- I still don't ever think it'll happen, but a lot of money is taking it seriously for some reason.One important point that was made: "The US liquidity situation could tighten if the debt ceiling is duly lifted. In this event, the US Treasury would need to replenish its cash hoard, draining liquidity from the private sector in the process. In recent months, it has run down its cash hoard in lieu of borrowing. As a result, the Treasury is about US$490bn below target (equivalent to about one week of outlays), which is roughly how much liquidity it will suck up when allowed to issue more bonds."I think liquidity is much tighter than it seems the past few months and it will become apparent later this year when the treasury is back to normal. I'm waiting to buy more until the summer/autumn.https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-24/debt-ceiling-treasury-s-tax-shortfall-brings-us-showdown-crisis-closer?srnd=premium

There's a paper by Bolhuis, Cramer, and Summers in the National Bureau of Economic Research that inflation is likely closer to the 70's than we think.  https://www.nber.org/papers/w30116There's also controversial data by places like ShadowStats showing what inflation would be without improvement to quality of products.  Purportedly they don't even actually recalculate CPI, simply add back in adjustments that the BLS self-reports to arrive at their figures.  Does it really matter if less money seems to be left for essential things in life now that our eyes get to see in 8k vs 4k?  The IPhone is definitely better than the best one that first came out at 3G speeds (capable of video, decently fast browsing, email, etc.) but it used to be free with carrier plans or $200 outright.  Are our lives really better if we have less money to spend on raising kids or essential services like our plumber, or healthcare?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 10:50:13'] The two most upvoted comments are saying “No.”Therefore, these stocks are a buy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 06:57:49'] The big banks have been maintaining their net interest margin in the 2.25%-3% range for years, and are near the higher end of this right now.  If the economy slows, their fee income will take a hit, but it shouldn't be catastrophic.  The FDIC assessments to handle regional bank failures should be manageable (so far, just a one time 1/8% assessment), and should be offset  by the new business they win from customers shifting to them in a flight to quality.  Single digit P/Es, valuations close to tangible book, and 3-4.5% dividend yields point to them being a good value here.That said, if I had 40% of my portfolio in banks and 30% in tech, I'd be looking to diversify out.  Consumer products (PEP, KO, CAG), defense (LMT,NOC,GD), energy (PXD,EOG,OVV), medical (CVS,CI,PFE,MRK), and industrial (PH, RTX, F) provide good values and decent dividends.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 06:29:54'] banks are going to face more headwinds in the future from more regulations and massively increase in fdic insurance premiums due to all the bank failures.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 13:43:00'] I think it depends if they are allowed to do their buybacks.JPM and BAC had both authorized $30 billion buybacks each.I just don't know how much they bought back.Especially with the optics of financials right now and on buybacks being frowned upon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 14:07:56'] I’ve put about 8% of my portfolio in bank stocks. That percentage is probably going to shrink to 5% or less, but I definitely want to keep buying a little bit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 06:42:20'] There are probably some small regional banks in KRE that are getting smoked from being in the ETF. Simple easy to understand ones that aren't underwater on the asset side. Mark the whole book to market and see if there's any equity left. As a whole the banking sector won't return much unless you buy cheap and the bank survives. With an ROE of 8-12%, if you buy at book value you'll be lucky to make a 10% return. The only way to increase returns would be to buy below book, and with that comes risk. At the end of the day, unless you know what you're doing with banks, why bother?

Even if one of the regionals fails, the big ones take a hit and it seemingly happens at random(at least to us laymen's) and that kind of uncertainty makes long term investing less desirable.I would just stay away from it all together.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 23:45:01'] 3M.  Bought 500 in 2013, and they're worth almost precisely what I paid for them 10 years later.  Of course, the dividends have purchased me a lot of "free" shares so it's not like I'm crying, but I bought AAPL at the same time, and I wish I would put everything into them.  I don't own losers because I refuse to gamble on any.  If I didn't buy CVX, MCD, AAPL, MSFT, V, etc., I'd just buy BRK.B, or SPY instead.  I have never really "lost" money in the market, and do not intend to.  Although, I've never once doubled my money in the short term like some people.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 19:01:12'] Mine are T (AT&T) and VZ (Verizon). - For T (AT&T): I bought at $19.76 (average cost basis for 100+ shares). The stock price is $18.61 right now, so that’s why it’s not too bad. The position is down -5.83% in my portfolio. - For VZ (Verizon): I bought at $50.09 (average cost basis for 100+ shares). The stock price is $37.66, so this one is worse. It’s down -24.82%- I sell covered calls on both of these while collecting dividends so it’s not too bad. I have a little more than 100 shares of each due to dividends getting reinvested at first. But I’ve turned off the DRIP for now, as I’d rather keep the cash and deploy elsewhere.- honorable mention: my MMM position is also down right now, but I love the dividends and hope to hold for a long time, as I do believe in the company long term

POST_TEXT: b'Follow-up to my MSFT/GOOGL/NVDA post earlier this week (resolution there was to keep all three but perhaps trim them some).  **This is part two, but will likely be the last such post for a while as I do not intend to bombard you with these types of posts (I know they might get annoying) but do value your feedback.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM?  By long-term I mean for the next 5-10 years, and taking into consideration various scenarios like stagflation, recessions, or on the flip side, an economic boom if Powell can figure out inflation and Putin loses his war quickly.\n\nMy preliminary thoughts:\n\n* AMZN: Overall, I see it as a good stock with a weakening moat.  AWS is their crown jewel and will likely remain so, but they are facing increasing competition from MSFT, GOOGL and others (e.g. ORCL, IBM, but these are to a much lesser extent).  E-Commerce appears to be slower growth especially given the immense costs of capex (delivery, warehouses).'

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 12:04:08'] I think Adobe is overpriced as well as CRM, but I'm more bullish on CRM than ADBE.  I like the business that CRM has, and I like their CEO, but I think they overpaid for Slack, as well have a pretty high current and forward P/E.  Both of their gross margins are great however, and I can see CRM getting back to their all time highs in due time.I like the business of Amazon much more.  AWS prints money, and their ad business is growing like crazy.  I want to disclose that I do own AMZN but don't own CRM or ADBE, though I have been eyeing CRM lately.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 11:52:24'] I think a truly long-term investor need not worry too much about the current macro environment when evaluating these companies. Amazon looks fairly cheap; Adobe looks a little expensive. Both wonderful businesses. Haven’t analyzed CRM.The thing about Amazon is that their current net income is comically low compared to what they could show if they wanted to. They also still have a lot of room for growth in all of their major businesses (e.g. ads, AWS, third party sellers, etc). They will likely face some temporary headwinds from supply chain and inflation issues, maybe some upward wage pressure across the board, maybe some regulatory issues. I think they may have some issues with retaining top talent given the low wages, poor benefits. I also worry about the fact that we have to depend on the management to transition from growth mode to earnings mode without destroying too much capital along the way.All of that said, my DCF with relatively conservative assumptions still tells me it’s cheap, so I say it’s cheap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-16 07:52:33'] Love to see the general bearishness on AMZN and ADBE. May have to buy more now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-16 22:00:05'] Long term CRM is a weak company. People who use Salesforce hate it. The data in CRM systems for sales is basically worthless because no one maintains the data in it. I see companies with Salesforce deployments who after 3 to 5 years literally are deleting everything in their instance and refilling it with a smaller but new dataset. They have so many products and few of them are well developed. Salesforce will still be used at a lot of companies in 10 years but I suspect their growth will stop in the next few years. Salesforce is really like a crappy low code platform for a lot of companies but other, better platforms are coming out. Palantir, Snowflake, Podio, iPAAS and other apps are all great examples of companies taking custom app mindshare away from custom Salesforce apps.CRM is basically like IBM. No one got fired for buying IBM consulting and same idea for Salesforce. But that isn't a great growth story. CRM trades at a 127 PE ratio and IBM trades at a 12 PE ratio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-15 12:52:16'] The only one I like as an investor is CRM and even then I don’t like them lol.

Just think there are much better technology plays.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 10:14:11'] If you like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, I'd suggest having a look at QQQ, since those four companies represent something like \~35% of the etf's weight. Buying the whole basket rather than the individual stocks might provide an easier buy-in as well, since one share of QQQ (with exposure to all 4 companies and more) could cost around $300, while buying up just one share of each could cost over 5k at current prices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 09:42:03'] Depends on your level of risk tolerance. I would never recommend anyone put 100% of their retirement into individual stocks, but if you want to contribute a portion to individual holdings, have at it.Investing in individual stocks carries far more risk. While the stocks you mentioned have a very low probability of crashing completely, you still take on that burden when investing in them. $VTSAX offers enough upside with minimal risk in relation to tech stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 09:47:44'] Many will tell you no, so you should definitely do it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 10:54:53'] Personally, I like to set and forget my retirement accounts. I’m like 90% VTSAX and rarely check it.I did recently buy GOOG and AMZN in my taxable account. I like to trade options and tbh it would be better to do it in the Roth IRA for tax reasons but the Vanguard platform isn’t trading friendly.My suggestion would be to open/add to those positions as you get more money in whatever account you want but selling your VTSAX to buy the stocks doesn’t seem like a good plan. I’m not a fan of closing my “safe” positions in an attempt to beat the market.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:28:43'] Since we will probably all wind up working for Amazon, I think it is important to show company loyalty early (all joking aside I think it will just continue to be a juggernaut- I hope it gets split up as I will be very happy to have parts of the whole- especially the cloud business).

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 14:51:44'] I think amzn stock will be flat next year but continues to be a long term holding for me.  Labour inflation, volume hiring, expanding logistics (doubling of fufillment centers im two years) will impact margins.  Amzn has said they are going to absorb most of the inflationary costs for now so were looking at decelerating revenue growth the next few quarters.  I think labour constraints/supply chain issues will extend further out next yearThe company looks at the long term so im still confident in management.  Tbh if it wasnt for aws i would have never bought amzn.  I wouldnt be adding to my amzn unless it goes below 3000I dont see a stock split as appealing.  It signals to me a management concern with the short term.

And loose more once vaccinations hit a high enough number and people start going out to shop and eat. Nope, Amazon seems like the bubble that will deflate along with Covid… which it inflated into a bubble when covid arrived, much like house prices.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 22:55:30'] The way this is calculated by the way is taking the premium attached to at the money call and put options at the ask for the expiration next Friday. This is then added to the current stock price and then subtracted to come up with the weekly risk range. Generally if we fall out of this range you can consider us to be oversold or overbought. If we hit the upper or lower risk ranges at the start of the week it could set up nicely for a good risk to reward trade for the opposite direction. When important macro news occurs like Fridays poor Cpi print, you can see big deviations away from these ranges.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 11:06:17'] Taking on extra risk like that, amplifies your stress, which in return can lead to selling low and buying high.  Very scary, very scary.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:59:25'] Yes in general this is a bad idea. It takes the normal risks of investing and compounds them since you’re borrowing money for your position. Why not take the $600/month and just invest that?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 11:16:19'] Taking loans to buy stock is stupidAlso you’re paying 10% off the top. You have to make double normal gains just to break even. Just invest the money slowly as you have if. You can buy in at 10% higher and still be in the same position, but without the weight of debt.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 11:04:31'] Terrible idea. If you are that confident in it buy some options and wait it out, whatever you can afford at the time. Investing borrowed money is a gambling addiction

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 11:06:01'] it's risky. If it works out you made free money. If it doesn't you lose money and have to pay the loan back.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 12:41:51'] I don't know your country of residence, but from the € symbol, I assume you're in the eurozone somewhere. Open an IBKR account, no monthly fees anymore, very low commissions, you get fractional shares and DCA $600 a month. BTW, Interactive Brokers is pretty much as professional as it gets with brokers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 11:40:50'] Instead of a loan you could create leverage of a sort by buying in the money call options very far in the future. I think the best strategy is to buy actual shares with your own actual money though. I think a lot of people look at the 2020 crash and replay all the ways they could have made a fortune levering to the max and buying the dip. If you really believe in Amazon, then buy shares every month with the money you would have paid off the loan with. If the stock does well you will still make good money, but if it doesn’t, your losses won’t be nearly as bad.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 11:49:07'] Good idea dummy
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 11:52:25'] I think its a very bad idea lol. Just buy shares with what you got if you don't have any money, this type of strategy is probably the reason why.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 14:52:28'] Are you still contributing to your investment account? Diversifying doesn’t necessarily mean you need to sell your Amazon shares now and reallocate. You can alternatively start putting your contributions to other holdings. Unless your Amazon position is an insanely high amount relative to your contributions (ie a $1m portfolio, 80% Amazon = $800k AMZN, and contributing $1,000 bi-weekly or something), selling arbitrarily isn’t necessarily a good thing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 22:33:03'] well I'd agree in general that you probably do not want to own 10% of your portfolio in any one stock, if you're just getting started and we're talking less than 40-50k total, then I would agree you probably want to make sure you're buying other assets to diversify with any "new" money.  It's all situational, and highly dependent on your individual situation, like others have said, when do you think you'd need the money?  If you can let it ride for 5-10 years then do just that or maybe take 10% of AMZN and diversify, at the end of the day if it's causing you discomfort, then I would advise you take measures to change that.  Not worth the stress man, and there are plenty of other good companies out there.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 15:52:49'] You should hold only what you’re comfortable holding. For some people, it’s 10% of their portfolio in any given position. For others, it may be 50%. Figure out what percent of your portfolio/wealth you would be comfortable holding in AMZN and then sell down to that.For me, AMZN is in my top 5 holdings, somewhere around 5% of my portfolio.

I've had stocks I bought then dropped 30% or more after a period of time.. you got to have a stomach to ride through buy the dip? or cut your losses.I suggest start simple, on ETFs.. do your time to study the terminologies and mechanics behind it.. listen to investing OGs like Jack Bogle, Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet and Munger to keep you anchored in the fundamentals and have a clear picture of the personal traits you need once you start in a life long hobby.my tops stocks are MSFT, AAPL, JPM, GOOG, AMD, COST, LOW, GS and AMZN. and then a bunch of smaller stocks less than 3% each.Congrats too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 22:46:22'] If you want to invest for the long term, your better off putting it into an index fund like the S&P 500.  It will let you have a tiny piece of the top 500 stocks in america, and it is a much safer bet than individually picking stocks.  When people individually pick stocks, 9/10 they end up performing less than if they just put their money in the SP500.   This even goes for economic professionals (see Jim Cramer lol).  I would also recommend putting some into the international fund, that way you aren't putting all your bets into the United States.  In the future, India may become an economic world superpower.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 05:58:53'] Good starting point.  You bought these tech stocks on a very green day.  Just sit tight watch the show.  With debt ceiling behind there could be some small rallies. May be higher Treasury bond rates coming causing market to dip. May be the other way around.  Key on these growth stocks is recession on the table or not.

What I’m trying to say is it’s not soo easy to assess if what you are doing is right or wrong. You really need to decide on what you want to get out of this and how long of a time frame you are looking at. 100% you are gonna get hit with people who yell “diversify”, “put it into some etf or mutual fund”. I will tell you what I do, in my Roth IRA I’m holding an index fund that morris the us total stock market, international index fund and a couple of dividend earners that i like.

POST_TEXT: b'Full disclosure: This was written after CNBC said AMZN might be interested in PTON.\n\nIt all gets down to Prime. Prime is the clear leader in membership fees given the rate they charge. I mean if you combined Costcos membership, Walmarts selection, UPSs shipping with Netflixs streaming you end up with the recipe for Amazon. The business is well, a jungle.\n\nOwning Peloton is a great value add for people who want Amazons retail business and want at home fitness. I can see them rolling out another tier of Prime, Prime Fitness. Or a bundle of retail, streaming and fitness. \n\nIts basically Apples subscriptions with a retail business thrown in. Conceptually it makes no sense but somehow it works.\n\nThis is pure speculation. I have no position in either stock. Cheers!'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 14:58:40'] Amazon doesn't need peloton to create a "Prime Fitness".
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 15:34:32'] So nothing is confirmed? It just says they are thinking about it. People like to get super hyped when nothing is even confirmed. Same situation happened with PayPal and Pinterest. Lets wait for the official announcement.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 15:18:42'] I’ll go with that! I have one share of PTON at $27.56 and I’m in the green after hours so I’m happy lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 05:48:40'] People that are commenting negatively truly don’t understand peloton business or balance sheet and cash flow statement.  Amazon is a massive distribution company and peloton isn’t a bike company, they are a content company.  They have growing subscription revenue at 65% gross margin.  Amazon has the network in place to get the bikes to homes with 2 day shipping and massively reduce the cost.  If you read the financials peloton needs to stop the cash burn on marketing and Amazon could help with this as well.  I don’t think it will go through but it would be a great acquisition for Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 15:58:30'] Maybe their own bikes are such a knockoff already they want to acquire all the IP and put in their own Amazon branded ones.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 00:25:29'] This is reeks of desperation from PTON management.  They know they are screwed and are trying to sell at a high price.  Why on earth would amazon buy PTON of all companies? It's a money losing business they have no experience in.As others have said; they could just organically build it in Prime for 1B and grow it from there.   Bikes are cheap to make.  PTON's brand isn't even that great right now and it surely isn't worth 10B.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 15:10:56'] I have puts which will be a lost, only $500 so not a biggie after making a good amount from this down fall over the last few months, but i would be surprised if pton doesn’t try rebuking this news, would be very bad in terms of negotiating a better deal if they don’t try rebuking, I still believe apple is the better choice with the connection of their apple watches
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 16:24:55'] Agree, but why spend close to 10 billion for this. They could probably develop it inhouse or buy a smaller company and get the same value for less than 1 Bn. They wont get the name peloton that many people associate with home-bikes, but i thing Prime Fitness actually sounds better, imo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 16:31:28'] Amazon already has Halo fitness membership. I think buying peloton would put a dent to their balance sheet. AWS is already covering losses on Amazon Retail business. PTON would be another cash burning business for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 16:41:54'] No one should buy peloton. If Amazon wants to do this, just create the product and launch it as part of prime…put peloton out of business then turn the screws on revenue

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 19:55:10'] Operating income was significantly down. $3.7 billion as opposed to $8.9 billion in 2021. Growth was low with no signs of it recovering in the future quarter. AWS was the only positive outlook (has been the story for Amazon the past few quarters). If it wasn't for AWS, they would be reporting an operating loss of over $3.5 billion.Guidance for 2Q was bad. Expected was $125 billion while Amazon expects $116-$121 billion. Operating loss is expected to increase. Rivian's evaluation was appraised on Mar 31st. Since then, it has dropped another 40%. Even if it is paper gains or losses, it's still value that Amazon could have gotten rid of at one point so some may see it as a 'bad' investment relatively speaking.Realistically, outside of AWS, there was nothing positive for Amazon in their recent earnings. Personally, I find myself shopping at Amazon less than ever. The prices aren't as attractive as they once were. Two-day shipping is great but I think people are numb to it at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 20:22:23'] I thought Amazon only invested $700 million in Rivian.   If that is the case, it's hard to see how they could lose $7.6 billion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 07:15:30'] The losses on the Rivian investment was not the reason Amazon tanked. Everyone knew about that. We know exactly how much of Rivian Amazon holds and Rivian is publicly traded. On any given day, we can look at the Rivian stock price and know exactly how much it affects Amazon. Amazon tanked because the retail business is struggling. Expected EPS is operating income and does not include mark to market gains or losses on investments.

The P/E can be “great”, earnings, financial statements, PRs, etc and the stock might not move how you would expect it, I do believe being a *by the book* trader/investor is great, but it has been a bit out of touch these last several years.

I'm no stock wizard but conservative is usually investing in stuff like ETFs where someone more experienced sells bundles of stuff packaged together. Picking individual stocks with no real experience it's just another form of gambling. Even the most conservative form of picking solo stocks from gut intuition is still very volatile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 01:42:18'] Conservative? Then I *think* the most important variable is moat. Which is hard to put a number to. But you can kinda tell who's got it, who don't, and who *really* got it.
POST: ['2022-05-04 08:49:19'] POST TITLE: b'When comparing it to the M2 money supply, AMZN looks pretty buyable.'
POST_TEXT: b"Has anybody seen/used this graph? [AMZN/m2sl](https://ibb.co/HT7LdW1)\nI know AMZN is very popular these days with the split coming up, but I was curious how bad the drop is. The regular charts don't really tell the whole story. When I compared AMZN to M2 it seems that we are very close to the COVID low. \n\nAny thoughts?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-04 10:16:16'] I wouldn't justify buying based on that graph, but the fundamentals for AMZN are outstanding in my opinion. In the last quarter AWS alone made $6.5b. If you annualise that run-rate and give it a 38x multiple you're basically looking at a $1T valuation. Given its growth rate and moat I personally I think you can give AWS a 40-50x multiple, but my point is that it's hard to value AWS alone at much less than $1T, and today the whole of AMZN is valued at around $1.2T.If you're being very conservative perhaps you could argue AWS is only worth a 30x multiple in this market and therefore AWS is "only" worth around $800m. But again, given that AMZN as a whole is currently trading at $1.2T it's still hard to argue that it isn't a reasonable valuation if you're planning to hold long-term. At least it's within a margin of error that will be practically irrelevant for anyone with a timeframe greater than a few years.

POST_TEXT: b' I have large position in AMZN. It has been #1 holding in my portfolio for last 4 years. We saw significant growth in 2020, share price jumped from $1800 to over $3000 within a year. Since then it has been consolidating side ways. Even after delivering great 2020 Q4 and 2021 Q1 results. Even in Q2 beside the revenue miss, their most profitable business AWS and Ad grew by good %. But we are now back to mid end of the consolidation.\n\nI own MSFT, AAPL and GOOG. But my position is half of what AMZN is, because I just love this company and feel like they have lot of room for growth with disruptive products Self driving cars (zoox), Internet Satellite (Project Kuiper), store automation, increasing amazon warehouse margin by more automation and less workforce and obviously continuing the AWS success. They are operating at huge scale if the new CEO focuses on efficiency it would be game changing.\n\nI am sort of looking for confirmation bias if I should still keep AMZN as my top holding, or slow'

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 17:21:52'] Large long term Amazon shareholder here. I think the biggest bull case is their advertising business that’s in the first inning. I find myself starting product searches on Amazon more and more often, relative to Google. Advertising on Amazon is much more high yield as people searching on Amazon have much higher intent to shop than those seeing an ad on Google or Instagram. All Amazon needs to do is maintain all the users locked in to their ecosystem already, and maybe add slowly over time like FB. Meanwhile build out and ramp up their advertising platform. Google and Facebook are trillion dollar advertising businesses, so I’m very bullish on advertising becoming a huge high-margin business for Amazon over time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 16:16:11'] I keep all individually owned stocks under 5% of my individual stock portfolio, simply because I don't want to be over-exposed to a large shift.I am in AMZN too and am bullish, but I still remember the bear case.AMZN is so large, they will be prone to swings from shifts in regulation, measures to create more competition, getting large-scale contracts (ie. government contracts: AMZN vs. MSFT) can all create small immediate shifts to the stock price, even if it is a good investment on paper.Short-term bear: AMZN did amazing in 2020, because it was poised to increase sales with the lock down. Some of that demand has died off. Their revenue for 2021, so far, is above 2019 levels, but below 2020 levels. Their stock price got an amazing increase in early 2020 from this, so a short-term adjustment downwards when sales didn't stay as high in 2021 was still a possibility. It still did so great in 2020, I'm happy with my position in it.Long-term bullish: I still see continued year-to-year growth and it seems to be a good pandemic-resistant investment. I will keep it in my portfolio. I will still keep it under 5%, as any individual company can run into trouble sometimes...sometimes at no fault of their own.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-18 04:58:38'] Their verticality is fairly unique. Most companies that try to stretch vertically end up with mediocre results or just fail and that include fellow blue chips. With Amazon, it seems almost everything they touch turns to gold. This is probably what they have that others do not. Like him or not Bezos is extremely good at projecting future demand for products and services. He has very good vision and unlike most ego maniacs, knew when to step down which showed wisdom.But to show how far they have come and how wide their breadth is: They started in retail and succeeded. Seeing they had retail and marketing, they used that to build their own electronics and sell those (Kindle). Using the tools they developed their digital distro, they developed their own server infrastructure and commercialized it (AWS). Once they had those services nailed down, they made even better electronics and started offering other tech services (streaming). Now they are using AWS for other things like developing robots (Astro), going into gaming (gaming division), improving delivery (internal delivery services) and even changing how retail is done in person (Fresh stores).The point here, is look at that verticality and how well they integrate things into their business. There is almost no waste. Its not just random crap strung together by a thread. It really is amazing. Other companies try this all the time but almost always fail never mind becoming leaders in such things. Hell it usually hard to integrate something you already do into your business but to step into a different industry and actually being the leader in much of it? Thats rare.So to answer your question. Its leadership that is unique. Amazon has the best business management of anything I have seen in my lifetime at the big cap level. There is no guarantee it will go on forever, but what they accomplished so far is historic.

They successfully beat out the pack in the early days of e-commerce and are now reaping the benefits. Through methods (some admirable, some inhumane) they've managed to build many moats to suppress competition, which many are calling out as improper business practices. With early lobbying presence in the Capitol, they have been shrewd in keeping politics on their side.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-18 05:09:19'] The power of Amazon is in my opinion its culture of innovation and extreme focus on efficiency.Sure they have some good products today (e-commerce, Alexa, AWS)…. But can anyone truly say that these will still be profit generating in 100 years? Amazon arrived where it is because it is a true innovator: it is venturing in new business continuously, killing quickly what doesn’t work and growing what does work. It has disrupted more than one industry. It is this culture of innovation that makes me believe they will still be around in 100 years. They also have a strong focus on efficiency and cost management. When you listen to employees working at Amazon, I’ve rarely heard anyone actually liking it. It’s difficult working there, expectations are high, pay is linked to performance… think of the toilet break jokes. This company strives to keep all the value for itself (hence for shareholders) which is why I believe it will be better than most companies at generating value. It’s not necessarily a nice company, but it’s a good company for shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 14:56:49'] For me they are the radio shack of modern times. I buy a lot of obscure components that I just can’t find locally. That said, they are way more than that and at some point people will see the relevance of AWS and that they have their hands in nearly everything from an upcoming satellite internet service to health care. I can’t see how this company is not 10x it’s size in 10 years. Well, unless the government breaks them up, which is entirely possible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 15:17:57'] AWS.  I’m not a network engineer but anyone who works in that field will tell you that their prices for their services makes it a no brained if you’re comparing the start up cost of buying your own servers, setting them up, getting license, maintenance costs etc.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 16:36:55'] Be terribly, terrible big. They aren't the only ones that do that (Microsoft and Google are also very good at being insanely big). This makes them hard to replace (esp. AWS), squeeze out competition, and be a major player in any area that they decide will be profitable for them. Being terribly, terribly big doesn't mean you will be that way forever (GE, for instance, is not bringing Good Things To Life as much as they once did) but it is quite an advantage and hard to fall too quickly or too hard.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 18:35:55'] Lots of good answers here, but two overlooked strengths. 1. Audio AI. Alexa is already superior to the competition, and AMZN is hiring more people for Alexa than all the hiring in Google. Why is this important? Zuckerberg thinks everyone will want to wear VR goggles and live in his metaverse in the future. Unlikely. I think an audio metaverse is an easier sell (everyone already has AirPods in 24/7). Alexa can be the audio metaverse’s operating system. 2 Customer service. AMZN will do anything to do right by the customer. If something goes wrong, call them and don’t be surprised when you don’t even have to ask for something free/compensated.

They had the product, good operations, fiscally sound decisions, increasing profits, etc....  But do no fault of their own something really bad happened for them.There is no reason to over expose yourself to a single company. AMZN could attract anti-trust regulations in the future, they could have small price swings over major goverment contracts (ie. MSFT vs AMZN), brick and mortar stores (Target, Wal-Mart, etc..) might become more popular again...perhaps they better integrate a product into urban areas, etc...Spread the risks out amonst many great companies also likely to do well...

I won’t even feel it if the market drops again. Zero pain. TBH, I probably wouldn’t even shrug. I’m so used to red that it’s comfortable. Green, though? I would feel that.

Macs are cool but MSFT did some amazing progress on making Windows machines suitable for developers, so Macs are replaceable as well.As a European, I haven't ordered anything from AMZN for months, there are always better local alternatives. AWS is still the best but both MSFT and GOOGL are catching up fast. For personal usage I prefer GCP over AWS.I can't imagine the world without GOOGL. Search may be replaced with some worse alternative, but there is nothing even close to YouTube. GCP is strong. Almost everyone has a Gmail account. Workspaces are used by a lot of companies.

Not individual apps/digital companies, each serving a purpose, but ecosystems where each app is curated by the company (but not necessarily created), where each ecosystem manager will try to lure the consumers by offering the best exclusive apps/services on their ecosystem (which is what Microsoft is trying to do, and, imo, succeeding so far).My guess is that, at the very least, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft will have the biggest ecosystems and, probably, the most profitable too.So, those three are my bet for the future (although, if I had to choose, I would say Microsoft is the best out of those three).

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-09 16:34:42'] It couldn’t hurt to put into any of these but if I were you I’d try to time AMZN if you’re buying more than one share. Since last year it’s been relatively flat with a lot of up/down volatility. So depending on when you bought, you wouldn’t have as much gains as you would if you bought in one of the many valleys. I know it’s not in your question but consider AAPL if it’s not in your portfolio yet. I’d also encourage you to keep SBUX on your watch list to scoop some up if it ever goes on sale.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 17:26:55'] There's a pretty big difference between "safe" and "good".  Sure it's "safe" in the sense that AMZN is obviously not going anywhere and you won't lose -20% overnight, but is it "good" in that you'll earn some reasonable appreciation anytime soon?  No one can answer that, of course, but it's been consolidating for over a year now which could give it some strength to try another run above $3500 - though I think the next catalyst will probably be the upcoming earnings release (first one by the new CEO).
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-20 06:54:06'] Yes/No. Safe because it's AMZN and it can shrug off most red days. That is also why it might not be for you because those red days will have you down a couple hundred dollars at least.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 17:14:31'] I think it’s kinda 50/50 if you get into it at these prices. Reason being, they are an everything store. Doesn’t take much for a bunch of smaller ecommerce businesses that provide better customer experience to start capturing corners of the Amz market place. Chewy for example. People use Amazon for convenience sake. Not because they necessarily like the company. It’s easy/quick. But, the experience is meh. That is a business model threat. They got smart ppl over there & dominate the market already. So, it ain’t crazy to think they can keep expanding. 50/50
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-20 07:25:15'] I think that amazon is a risky stock. Not because the buisness is not going to grow but because of how exp the stock is.

Sure all the random basement crap from my folks, grandma, Sears catalogs, kids stuff and new old stock floppy disks sell well on there but folks don’t think new and current stuff. I buy lawn carburetor kits, bags, guards, belts, shop vac bags, knockoff batteries, extra drills, parts all the time on there. Most folks don’t. Sometimes the prices are nuts, you have to filter off outside the US sometimes, doing math on free shipping or paying for shipping plus good price is hard for folks. Amazon makes it idiot proof. They pulled away with the 2 day shipping (eBay it’s on the seller and they’re (even me) picking the cheapest snail mail for whichever party is paying. Folks get off on instant gratification. They can’t wait for a week. My buddy loves Amazon and I’ve seen him pay more for grocery/Target stuff than what other stores sell it for. He doesn’t know better nor care. eBay folks still want a deal. Also, I’m not buying food and household staples there, it would be Amazon. Powersports and auto people love eBay, that’s not Amazon’s strong suit. eBay doesn’t cater well to the volume stuff either. I really hate Amazon as I find it confusing with too many options, eBay has a much better search feature (Amazon does Oz voodoo crap making it impossible to see more than a few hits and filter/sort). eBay moved from auctions too late and Amazon revolutionized retail and expectations with 2 day shipping.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:38:19'] As someone who uses both the products and is invested in both the stocks, the 2 e-commerce platforms are fundamentally different. Ebay operates more like an independent platform without their own skin in the game, which has its pros and cons. Whereas amazon controls all parts of its e commerce experience: platform, warehousing, supply chain, and logistics. One of the major cons for eBay is inconsistent user experience when buying from different sellers. Whereas a main pro is they don’t have added cost of maintaining logistics services and warehouses all over the country. Amazon is a huge huge company with lots of other businesses (AWS being their main cash cow). So they have the freedom to afford lower profit margins in their e-commerce business. Ebay on the other hand is only an e-commerce marketplace. I have not checked the recent numbers, but if you compare just their e-commerce platforms, eBay’s percentage profit will come up higher than amazon e-commerce.Addition after reading other comments: contrary to the popular belief, you can find great first hand products on eBay as well. Ensure you check the seller’s past ratings to see if they are good. And similar to prime, ebay has ebay money back guarantee, for cases when you don’t like the product and the seller is not listening to your concern. In such cases, after a few days, ebay will step in and refund the buyer and ding the seller later.

I mean, Amazon was always the big dog in the e-commerce game, but I remember when eBay was giving them a run for their money. It's just kind of sad to see how far behind they fell.I think part of the problem was that eBay just didn't have the same level of ambition as Amazon. Amazon was always looking to expand and take over the world, while eBay seemed content with just being a smaller player in the game. And, you know, when you're playing against someone who's trying to be the biggest and the best, it's hard to keep up.But, you know, it's not like eBay didn't have the chance to be a big player. They just didn't take it. I mean, they had the platform and the user base, but they just didn't have the same drive as Amazon. And that's really what it comes down to, I think.Anyway, it's definitely interesting to see how these two companies grew so far apart. I guess it just goes to show that ambition and drive are really important in the business world.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 13:51:29'] Honestly, there's a very good chance that such a portfolio would outperform the broader market in the next 5-10 years. These are well-run companies with diversified revenue streams. Obviously only buying a few companies is risky, compared to an broad ETF--but these are some of the best companies in any index. Let's be real--these companies could go the way of IBM or Blockbuster, but not overnight. You'll have time to modify your portfolio if the need arises.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-30 05:39:18'] I'm reading a lot of negative comments on this thread about this strategy. Does everyone realize that you can walk into every office in the world and every employee will have GOOG or AAPL phones and log in to their MSFT workstation? It's not a coincidence that the dominant operating systems and cloud service providers are in this position. The whole world depends on these companies. Every successful business and every failed business will dish out money to these companies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 11:07:28'] Have you considered that this might be too volatile for you? Having a tech-only portfolio means that when money is moving out of the tech sector, and this could last months, which means you could be seeing a lot of red. Most redditors and their tech stocks got burnt badly in Feb/Mar for this reason and have not recovered.While index funds have not performed as well, them being diversified across multiple sectors gives your portfolio more stability. There is also no guarantee that tech will continue to be the most dominant sector on the off chance that inflation and interest rates go out of control.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 14:48:43'] Though these arent bad picks, I personally dont recommend it. Im a tech guy too but I play it much more defensively at a time when valuations are high. Remember its not just comparing valuation, there is also macro conditions to consider.For example, right now, the entire market PE is in bubble territory with the S&P500 PE hovering around 45. Even though we can explain this rationally with covid earnings, low interest, bonds being dead money, inflation, and other things, markets are not rational.So for me personally, I play defensive when the macro indicators are bad. Thats not to say I dont like AMZN, GOOG, APPL or MSFT, but that I dont trust valuations.Right now I am basically running 25% cash, and I would say 50% of my actual portfolio (not including the cash) is defensive. Consumer cyclicals, consumer non-cyclicals, blue chip with low PE+Div growth, real estate and I even have some fixed income (preferred stock for REITs I consider reliable long term).I would suggest you take the macro indicators into account. I also highly recommend a div paying strategy and letting the pot of cash build itself for dips and crashes.Now if markets PE starts to look good again (sub 30), then I would probably switch the strategy to what you are doing and just buy high growth cash cows. Which is what I basically did last year in the crash and in the financial crash though I didnt buy tech specifically this time around.As a final disclosure, my 15 year performance is absurd using the flexible strategy above. Most dont believe it but its basically about 30% yoy growth... Not saying everyone can replicate this but as it turns out, like great chefs, great investors can come from anywhere.

These companies have tons and tons and tons of runway.What people do not get is they really have barely even got started.  Take Google.  They have so much room to further monetize the assets they have collected.The big four are more and more going to do their own stuff instead of using others.  Take chips.  Google has already been doing their own network processors and AI silicon and that will continue to spread.   Same with Amazon that is already started to do their own processors for their cloud.   But it will be one thing after another.    These companies just have resources unlike pretty much anything before.

Can you not just reduce VGT to 60-70% and split the money between GOOG and AMZN? Also, spread those investments out over a couple of months or even half a year. AMZN is quite pricey right now although they obviously have a good thing going.But yeah, I also work in Tech and I get what you're saying.

I’d recommend ETFs with large holdings of these securities over holding just these individually, though.Either way, I personally would say don’t sell your ETFs, just add on the individual stocks over time to get heavier weightings in them.

Comparatively, FAANG names like $GOOG and $MSFT have far outperformed the S&P. \[1\]I often see people post things like this, benchmarking a given stock over a certain period of time.  What you're failing to mention here is that JUST before this 365 day period AMZN went on a historical run where the stock price almost doubled in 4 months.  That's INSANE growth.It makes sense that the stock would trade somewhat flat after a run like that.  I'm not here to say AMZN is not a great investment, I'm just saying that I would be a little weary of buying call options after a bull run like that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-18 09:21:09'] This is always a risk when buying a stock with a very, very high valuation: prices crashes, or price settles in while earnings catch up to the valuation.  Even for great, profitable, growing companies like Amazon.Sometimes if you're just riding momentum it can keep going up short-term and you can sell for profit.  But it can also crash/stagnate.  Right now it's stagnating and I expect that once all the jitters/re-pricing from the interest rate hikes are done, it will start a new run of rapid price growth.  Then it will sit and consolidate again.

POST_TEXT: b"Hey all,\n\nHave more of a general question - I recently opened up positions in a few large cap stocks (AMZN, META, PEP to be specific) with plans to hold these for the foreseeable future.  Long term holds that I don't plan on looking at or touching too often.  The question I have is - what is the reason do to do this rather than just put it all in some index fund like VTI?  Am I better off just throwing all of these funds in an index fund like that? Realistically the chances of these stocks beating the overall market seem to be slim. Pardon my ignorance if this is an obvious question!\n\n  \nFor transperancy, I was planning on putting \\~70% of my funds into index funds (VTI and SCHD) anyway, and using the other 30% for specific stocks.  Is it better to just put 100% into ETFs?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:02:45'] What you're describing is a strategy called Core-Satellite investing.Essentially the strategy is that the core of your portfolio is index funds, and the "satellites" are individual stocks that you hope will be able to outperform the market. The benefit of the strategy is that if you can beat the market with your individual stock picks you'll still do better then the index, and if you fail to beat the market your core of index funds will stop you from trailing the market too badly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 09:46:55'] If you’re going 70% into large cap ETFs, I don’t see why you need to add more of the same exposure through individual holdings. You can buy other stocks and explore a bit more (maybe to mid caps) and still be okay if your picks aren’t stellar.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 10:24:31'] I don't see any problem with doing both. The large cap funds could easily beat VTI. Investing in both merely means that you believe in the industry but hedge your more risky bets against a more safe return. If you have a good reason to believe in a specific company then you should definitely invest in it specifically.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 09:34:42'] I mean, the idea of going with an index is that you become a passive investor. Usually indexes have requirements around who is and isn't in and companies change over time. You could totally buy some companies, but there is still a good chance that you will over perform the index. Like even right now, QQQ/SPY are seeing a lot of growth YTD from a few companies, like APPL, MSFT, and NVDA. It really comes down to how active you want to be I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 11:05:47'] risk vs reward. when you put money into amazon you bet on amazon. when you put money into vti, you bet on hundreds of companies. many of those companies will fail. also. amazon is not a fund.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 12:10:07'] Hopefully you invest where you think you will get the best returns. If you think those names will outperform the index, buy them. If you think the index will do better....buy the index.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 12:58:22'] Why VTI and SCHD instead of SPY?Why do you think these two will beat SPY?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 08:20:27'] I was invested in a long running regional utility that had 100+ years of steady to growing dividends that had never been missed.   It was located in tornado alley, and its region got hit by a super cell tornado.  Much of its infrastructure was destroyed, so no more dividend for the foreseeable future if the company even survived.   Its stock fell to fractions of what I paid even though I had held for a long time.Since that happened, I do not invest in individual stocks.   Besides with small, early stage companies, that perhaps a person has some kind of specific knowledge, where the upside is worth the risk, why take on that individual exposure when ETFs are so readily available is my argument.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 10:32:09'] The bear case is price to earnings contraction. PE is currently at 58x. I could easily see earnings rise 15-25% a year over 5 years but PE still contracts to 15-25x. The company could perform incredibly well and it still trades sideways for 5+ years given its current price.The other issue is regulatory issues as more pressure is put on big tech companies but this is to me a secondary issue.

If you believe in tech, just go spy or qqq because youll get exposure to the up and coming companies without needing to guess which ones are going to be the new top dogs in 20 years. Although if i was going to bet which current companies will still reign in 20 years, it would be aapl, msft, goog and amzn.

But she ended up selling a $50k stake for pennies on the dollar when it didn't pan out.    And we're still today sitting at <$3400.But this is just me...

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 16:23:18'] Netflix’s recurring revenue and sub base could be stickier than you think. To the effect that they may even be a recession resistant name since you could argue it’s the last subscription to cut. I also think that their content ecosystem and developed brands is strong relative to competition and they have the best penetration to introduce better targeted/marketed content to the biggest audience. The data they have on viewer preferences is the best and I think they are able to leverage this against competition that may need higher per sub investment to develop the write content mix.I would also reframe your point about their competition. You could argue they have a competitive advantage as a pure play in the space. The other big names are diversified and while that brings resource and expertise I think in the end, higher capex properties, like media production and distribution, may be candidates for divestitures/spin offs. Not to say bigger players couldn’t win but it’s not a sure thing just because they have deeper pockets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:09:36'] In my opinion theyre all expensive companies. They trade with high multiples of market to book value and price/earnings/CF metrics. Not to say it isnt justified given their performances are phenomenal but all upside predictions are pricing in growth using assumptions and it is very possible they can drop a significant amount still. Although they are cheaper than before i wouldnt compare to previous levels as it wouldnt mean much. I prefer to pick my investment without using as little assumptions as possible: I picked META at $92 (250B cap at the time, 180B assets,  $105b tangible, 60B cash and marketable securities, strong FCF on a TTM, strong rev and margins close to peak) but im getting ready to sell incase things go south since things seem to be going to well for my liking.  I also chose to invest in DIS (got in at $90ish) instead of NFLX although retrospectively i would have done much better doing the opposite, but i still think it is better from a risk/reward perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:29:10'] Yeah, I don't see where Netflix goes from here. Before, Netflix was gobbling up all kinds of collections of movies and TV. Then they were expanding into making their own originals and many of those were really successful. Then the pandemic happened where people were consuming tons of TV. Now? All three of those are still going on, but I don't know if it's quite enough to maintain the massive growth of the past. Users have such high expectations of Netflix, so Netflix has to spend so much money to keep up, especially when there are competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 02:59:36'] Just my opinion, but streaming isn’t going anywhere and Netflix is optimizing for higher monthly payments. This will work because they have good addicting content. They may not grow to the moon, but they will continue to grow.Google however, is a one-trick-pony (search) masquerading as a conglomeration (Alphabet) - None of Google’s other ventures amount to anything.  The problem Google has is that ChatGPT and other AI is just about to upend search in a huge way (it’s really, really disruptive and yes, it’s that good). And once someone else wins search, Google is effectively dead overnight. Don’t think Google is dead overnight? I present to you that Google itself killed Yahoo as the default internet “start page” practically overnight. That’s *how* Google became Google.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 05:17:20'] I have a great degree of respect for Netflix as a tech company because they have been a legitimate innovator in terms of building a very intelligent SoA system, tons of microservices, their architecture and blogs are very fascinating reads to see how a world class organization handles it's data and systems. They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.However today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.Middle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.Netflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. I think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience. A true event that they have to capture at the designated time because otherwise they feel left out when their peers are talking about it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 06:03:41'] It's even worse than you lay out.  NFLX debt and content obligations are so much more crippling than most realize.  And their debt is all rolling over into a terrible credit environment.  Their clueless execs have pledged to keep increasing content spend, which they can't afford, and soon, won't be able to finance either.  And content costs will be bid up by their much richer competitors.  They hit customer saturation several years ago, and hid it with their silly metrics.  They hit price saturation at covid re-opening.  So they can't grow subs, and they can't charge them more... but they have to.  Their funky and false way of claiming "profitability" won't hold up to tougher scrutiny.They're doing their usual shell game of pretending there's growth with the shiny object of ad-tier.  But you don't make an ad-service that requires customers to sign up and pay.  That's why they had to refund all their advertisers.  And the ad-tier will cannibalize their existing subs/pricing anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 08:23:07'] Facebook & Netflix have both been dead for a while. FB F’d up their cash balance big time. Netflix has too much competition & isn’t the only major player in its space now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 11:15:46'] >It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers.It's not a vicious cycle, it's theoretically a virtuous cycle when done correctly. In fact, it is the bedrock of Netflix's business model. [Check out Netflix's flywheel](https://jenvandermeer.org/2020/06/09/netflix-business-model-teardown/)You cannot compare Google and Netflix. They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)Also, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).Their gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. TLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't. Very different companies.

If I want to see the new Rocky, ill just get a sub for a month then cancel.Buy it or not, makes no difference.

Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\n\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\n\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:16:25'] The market cap is just so huge takes a lot to move now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:47:57'] The question around Apple is how can it maintain high growth if it has become so big?  Eventually it will get to a point where even if they make new products that are highly profitable, because they are so big already that may translate into single digit growth.  They would need monster success from new capital deployed just to keep up a modest growth rate.It does look like Apple still has a lot of growth potential though.  They are far from 100% of the phone/pc/device market, and there are still ways they can capture more revenue from its users from the app store, fintech, streaming media, and so on.  Eventually it will start reaching a limit, but I don't see that limit yet.  The bigger risk around Apple is its dependency on Asia for production and sales, and how China may upset all that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 01:35:09'] They are overvalued but were considered "safe" (except for FB) so they are the last to reach top. That's typical of bubbles: first they kill speculative fare, then small caps and growth and finally they shoot down the blue chips. At that point the whole market starts to tank since there isn't anything else left to park money into.For the past year they've been parking money into real estate and commodities which also became overvalued, so the only option left is to go abroad for those funds that are allowed to invest internationally. Though we have splendid bubbles in foreign real estate and in some emerging markets such as India as well.I think that they are gradually repositioning in expectation of a crash next year as the Fed starts tapering off and then increasing rates.Of course retail will be the last to know. When the market starts tanking in earnest and hedge funds are done taking their short positions then they will push doom and gloom through the financial media to scare retail into panic selling. A trick as old as the world but it never fails.It should be interesting to see how crypto fares in all this. I think that it will crash and burn despite the propaganda that it is "digital gold". The "everything bubble" will likely end up in the "everything crash".I also expect that the China story will start to change. After all, it is the only major market that looks undervalued (at least in the tech sector), though Chinese real estate is not a good place to be. All that depending on some toning down of geopolitical tensions.

Biggest reason they stopped growing is because they made bad calls and couldn't innovate. Apple (M1 chipset) , Amazon (AWS) , and Facebook (Metaverse) have not shown any sign of not innovating. Do the three have problems? Sure but what company doesn't. This is just a brief hiccup for them. Their time will come, but I don't believe it is anytime soon

POST_TEXT: b'Looks like stock split isn\'t happening anytime soon, and beside handful of broker in US, majority of people in US and pretty much all international investors can\'t afford to buy AMZN at this price. \n\nSo what is stopping AMZN to not offer another fund with different ticker which is basically just a main share/10 or 15. Depending on how low they want it to be\n\nGoogle has also done similar, but for some reason both of them are almost similar price so it still doesn\'t make it affordable\n\nIs there any specific reason beside "Bezos doesn\'t like split" - also I can\'t find his quote saying this. When was it?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 05:35:16'] They can do anything they want but offering a second class of stock has nothing to do with not wanting to split it has to do with voting rights.  In your Google example they did a 2-1 split with the payout being the newly created class of shares being the non-voting ones.  This gave everyone who owned Google the same number of non-voting shares as they had voting shares which is why the price stayed the same.  The reason they did this was insiders wanted to sell but they did not want to dilute their voting rights so they sold some of their newly created non-voting shares.  I believe that newly created stock options and grants given to employees are now the non-voting shares also to not dilute the voting stake the founders have.As for BRK here is the google summary:Berkshire Hathaway has two classes of common stock designated Class A and Class B. In 2009, a share of Class B common stock has the rights of 1/30th of a share of Class A common stock except that a Class B share has 1/200th of the voting rights of a Class A share (rather than 1/30th of the vote).So basically Amazon could create a new class of shares but would only do it if they cared about preserving voting rights for Bezos (which may be a moot point now because of his divorce)
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 11:41:05'] idk, seems like the stock gets fucked with pretty regularly even being north of 3K a share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 06:51:14'] Keeping the stock price high could be intentional to discourage retail small investors from playing around with the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-18 17:06:40'] It’s not by default, it’s by design. So only if they make that arrangement in the spin off deal, but there is no legally required set up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-19 05:10:05'] Could be, could be not.Both cases have happens. Siemens e.g. has spun off quite a few companies in the past and have used different approaches in these cases.When Siemens got rid of Osram, Infineon and Siemens Energy every shareholder received shares of the new entity. Siemens was not interested in the business segments anymore, they wanted to focus on higher profitable segments and the company was worth almost the same without them, so they decided to "gift" them to the shareholders.The last IPO of Siemens Healthineers was very different. The new company is leader in a very promising and growing field but a lot of investments and maybe some acquisition are necessary to stay competitive. Siemens decided to IPO minority stake in that business to raise money for these investments so they will be able to profit from positive developments through their majority ownership but Siemens did not have to raise the money themselves and take on the risks for these investments.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 09:08:21'] *Boom*, Atlanta Fed dropping its next update. From 2.2% --> **2.4%**.> The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the first quarter of 2023 is **2.4** percent on February 15, up from 2.2 percent on February 8. After recent releases from the US Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Census Bureau, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, an increase in the nowcast of first-quarter real personal consumption expenditures growth from 3.0 percent to 3.6 percent was slightly offset by a decrease in first-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth from -5.6 percent to -6.5 percent.Again, keep in mind this is real growth, quarterly, seasonally adjusted, and annualized. So this is saying GDP will increase by 0.6% (= 2.4% / 4) from the end of Q4 2022 to the end of Q1 2023 after accounting for inflation and seasonal effects.

The problem is assuming that real rates are 1.0%-1.4%.  In reality, many prominent economists such as Rogoff, Elrian, etc. believe that Fed quickly realized 2% was never achievable and so they will end up targeting 3%-4% persistent but mild inflation.If that's true, then real rates aren't 1.4% but closer to 0% and stocks may even be very undervalued!  This is all JUST based upon current rates.  If the Fed pivots to rate cuts even 3 years down the road (not even this year), stocks become even more undervalued.  The political and social climate right now is one of extreme "crisis fatigue".  No one has the will power or political capital for violent adjustment.People who read my rants here know I have been saying this pretty much all of 2022, don't expect Fed to crash the economy to solve inflation as long as they can point to progress.  That real estate and stocks ARE the play, not debt or cash.

Similar to slowly buying the dip, but in reverse (selling the rip).If you truly do NOT want to sell any, you can always buy puts as a hedge, and buy them slowly as well. stock rips? your puts expire but are outweighed by stock gains. stock falls? you in minimize your losses with puts.

I’ve saved up about 15k that i want to invest in an index fund- I’m thinking VTII’m debating between a brokerage account and Roth IRA. I know the Roth IRA is the better choice from a tax standpoint, but I don’t like the idea of needing to wait 35 years to reap any of the benefits. I’m very much a “live in the now” person, and feel like given my mindset and goals a brokerage account makes more sense, even if down the line I am paying more in taxes so I can reap the benefits sooner. But it’s possible I’m also just a dumb 20 something thinking too short term. Am I making a mistake with this mindset?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 11:05:48'] I would say I fall in the bull camp, but with that said I can't help but feel like we are not out of the woods yet. Yes, we have had some good signs regarding the "war" on inflation but that doesn't mean that the effects of that "war" won't persist for the next year or two. People are acting like the fed lowered rates by .25 BP yesterday and not the other way around. Companies will feel the effects of the current Macro environment, and while that doesn't mean a bearish doomsday, the reality is that all signs point towards a worsening economy and many still bloated stock prices. I DCA so this doesn't really affect me, but I think the overactions on both sides for the past year plus have been quite scary to see.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 12:01:00'] Yes, the market is forward looking. In amazon’s case, more reinvestment means higher P/E since people believe in their ability to use that investment money to further innovate and carve out market share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 14:39:42'] Pretty easy to check their income statement. Last quarter they reported $13.9B R&D compared to $7.8B net income. Without R&D, they could have $20B net income give or take after taxes. PE would be less than half of what it is now. Other companies spend on R&D too obviously, but not on the level of Amazon. Google reported 7.7B R&D and 18.5B net income. Apple reported 5.7B R&D and 21.7B net income.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 12:24:05'] If Amazon keep blowing out EPS beats every quarter and then the stock price only range bound,  the PE will only be keep going down.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 14:25:06'] I think Amazon is actually one of the more undervalued tech stocks right now :0 Morningstar kept their fair value at 4200 while the other tech stocks are starting to get around their FVE now ( with apple being overvalued )
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 17:08:14'] It would be very low. Frankly Amazon is dependent on huge growth. If they didn’t invest that much to at least seem able to hit crazy numbers in the future who knows. Side note on Tesla. Literally priced in. Almost impossible to hit the growth numbers they are currently priced. Even if they did it would be an over valued company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 19:40:46'] The exact same. Dividend payments don't effect net income.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-24 14:25:31'] FWIW it would generally be the same.  Investing activities, capex, R&D doesn't immediately fully affect earnings per se, not directly.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 00:57:13'] These four have plenty of growth left. Anything in the cloud space still has a long, long ways to go. You may not see 40-60% yoy numbers but these companies also have incredible margins on portions of their businesses. Unregulated monopolies are some of the best businesses in the world.I actually think in a pullback these will fare better than a lot of people think. I sold a lot of my value stocks (LMT, VZ, BTI, MRK, etc) and feel much better sitting in Amazon and Microsoft.I think TSM is a great business and is a juggernaut right now. One option is you just buy a small bucket of stocks and don’t look at this as either-or. The two industries I know very well are cloud tech and semiconductors and I own more of Amazon than anything else followed by Microsoft. Or, you can just buy a low fee index fund (VT) and not touch it for 30-40 years and I have a feeling you’ll do pretty well.

These companies still have tons and tons of runway to work with.   They have incredibly valuable assets that have yet to be monetized.For growth I see Amazon and Google continuing to have the strongest growth going forward.  But Apple and Microsoft will also continue to enjoy strong growth but see it more easily for Apple.You are also going to see these four competing against one another more and more.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 00:10:07'] All of these mega tech companies are near-monopolies in their primary products and those products have a very high technical entry barrier.   And combine that with the amount of cash they generate,  they probably can buy any other company apart from each other and a handful of other companies.   They can throw money, resources or buy their way into any new technology and snap up any company that remotely threatens their bread and butter products.   That said, it is hard to look apart from them in the tech sector in the longer term.  The only real reason to doubt them is Government intervention.  They all are too big for their own good now and there is a possibility of Govt regulation negatively impacting them.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-04 13:43:28']  - Price targets themselves are nebulous.    - To see if a price target is worth two bits we need to read the corresponding analysis/basis and look at the proponent's track record and or biases.    - Therefore pointing to a price target without even saying who made it and reading their arguments is a nothing-burger.    - Ultimately everyone has been saying Amazon is underpriced for *months*, but everyone also knows that interest rates and high market instability will hurt it due to its high P/T and how much expectation is already baked in.     - So buy/don't buy, but in either case you owe it to yourself to read the PT's actual white paper even if just to understand the timescales and risk involved.     - Amazon can be successful **and** you can still lose money when the company is running a 60+ P/E with tens of years baked in. The question is are you going to sit on your hands if they drop 20% during a market event? Are your timescales *actual* in the tens of years?

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-04 15:18:27'] Weekly 4240 calls?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-04 17:46:25'] I'm skeptical about expectations that their recent growth will continue at a similar click. I have no doubt that a huge part of their increased sales and earnings is attributable to advantages from the pandemic, from amplified purchases of goods from food and toilet paper to clothes and light fixtures. Not to mention, with the amount of time spent at home, sales for digital services like Prime Video likely reached a peak. Those advantages are going to wear away as people begin to shop for things in person that, while they would prefer to see and size-up a purchase on the spot, they have had little choice except to buy online, sight unseen. That's not to say that they can't grow further, but I would say that that kind of price target in the next year either has to assume continued massive growth, which I feel is unlikely with the pandemic unwinding, or that speculation and momentum will be enough to carry it there. The latter carried Tesla to about 1 trillion in market cap on negative earnings, so Amazon could certainly hit the target and exceed it; such a feat would be less ridiculous, IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-04 14:18:33'] These ridiculous price targets for Amazon have been thrown around since last summer.  It’s not happening.  They have zero momentum at the moment and are significant below their all time high.  It needs to prove that it can sustain 3400-3500 before it even sniffs 4k+.  So far it has failed in miserable fashion.  I have a feeling it will be another year before it breaks and holds 3500.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-04 20:20:15'] Amazon stays flat for months at a time, best to sell puts, then if they get exercised sell covered calls. Either that or buy 2023 LEAPS (I do both)

POST_TEXT: b"Basically I live alone and I don't forsee myself needing funds any time soon. I'm betting heavily that AI will blow up in the future so most of my stocks are centered around that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 10:40:33'] What’s an exit strategy
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 10:27:07'] You just need to follow up with news related to your invested companies. You also need to have a goal. Why are you investing long term, what are you trying to achieve? and how this range (5-20 years) is calculated? If you answer these question, then I guess you'll eventually have your exit strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:19:44'] If you're "betting" big on AI, I think you might want to rebalance a bit. Contrary to popular belief, no company is more invested in AI than GOOG. Nobody started as early as Google either. If you look at the paper on transformers, it was pretty much written exclusively by Google employed machine learning specialists. They've considered themselves AI first since 2016. They bought DeepMind outright in 2014.The only reason everybody doesn't realize that Google = The AI Future, is because of ChatGPT this, ChatGPT that. Google's internal AI efforts are far beyond ChatGPT, but Google isn't that preoccupied with trying to have the best large language model app that works well with the general public. But that's ok, a great opportunity to pick up the No.1 AI company on planet earth for cheap.Nvidia of course is an obvious AI play, and I'd put them right behind Google in overall AI importance. There's an AI gold rush on the way, and Nvidia sells the equipment that's needed. Meta is way more of an AI play than anyone realizes. If you really want to be heavy into AI, you want GOOG, NVDA & META in that order. But Meta is top 3. They're employing some of the best AI talent available. Some of the top minds. Honestly, only Google has more qualified AI engineers.MSFT is late to the party on AI, but they do have tremendous resources, so I'd probably put them as the 4th most important AI play.AMD isn't a bad pick at all, not necessarily AI focused, but they will try to eat Nvidia's leftover scraps, so a worthy holding in the portfolio.  I know C3 AI has gone on a crazy run over the last 4 or 5 months off the AI hype, but the ticker symbol is AI, afterall. As silly as it might sound, there is something to that ticker symbol. When all AI is blowing up, goof balls that aren't up on anything will be buying ticker symbol AI, not even knowing what they're investing in. Luckily, they will be investing in a decent company that could be a force in the not too distant future. I remember Thomas Seibel from the old Seibel System days. He knows his ish. It's all about CRM type software that has been infused with advanced AI capabilities, and I think he can pull it off.TSLA is a decent AI play, not really related to their cars but their actual AI system that keeps learning more and more. The amount of data that every Tesla on the road is beaming back to the mothership could end up being quite valuable for developing anything that has to navigate a complicated environment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 10:51:53'] It seems everything is in tech and growth.  If you have an unexpected need to sell some of your stock, the ups and downs in tech maybe at a down time and you'd end up having to sell when prices are low.I think you need to diversify in at least three or more industries and in different type of stocks.  This will provide more steady growth. If some industries and types of stock slow, the slowdown could be hedged by other industries and types of stocks that are growing.  Maybe a telecom stock that pays a good dividend and is expected to grow they dividend for 25 more years will be up during a time when investors start looking for income and long-term yield growth. Maybe tech might decline more and warehouse stores may still keep growing.  Maybe a short-term bond ETF may help earn some income short term, and if the stock market declines you can sell it and buy more stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 12:59:57'] It might be helpful to ask yourself, “What’s my tolerance for volatility?” Lots of people think they’re long-term stock investors — until we have a year like 2022 and they sell everything at the bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 13:00:21'] I’m new to investing, but your portfolio looks like you’re off to a good start. My “exit strategy” is to just keep everything in my portfolio until I’m 70, 80, 90, etc (or really need some money to live off of after a stock has massively increased over a few years- I’m 52). I’m letting it grow. Set it and forget it. Not planning on selling anything but might buy more if we hit a recession and market crash and everything goes on sale. You will probably see the most gains if you just leave it alone, especially if/when the market crashes. A lot of stocks might dip hard during a recession, but then go up even higher after. So, don’t be tempted to sell if a recession comes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 14:35:59'] Think of an exit strategy in this context being more of exiting your particular tilt (AI) to a more conservative portfolio. You'll be able to bear far less risk in 20 years, so think of how to set up a glide path from today's portfolio into a boring Boglehead portfolio as the years pass. Maybe shift 5% of your portfolio over each year or something.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:30:08'] Fora long term investor the only reason to sell (if you don’t need the funds) is if your thesis is no longer valid. Which means you need to regularly evaluate the companies that you hold. Some may say that you need to rebalance if one or 2 companies run up too hard but I’m off the opinion that you should just let your winners ride. Nothing is worse than selling a winner too early
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 18:01:24'] Depends on your age and net worth. However, assets tend to increase their dollar denominated value over time if they are still producing value. So as long as you have good companies (or ideally just an index), you should just be holding and then storing your salary in company shares, regardless on how they are valued, since it's better than having an ever-increasing in supply money. A good rule of thumb tho is 100-your age = stonks % u Shud haveRest in cash-like assets. Truth is we don't know what is actually safe and if we all knew that would probably be overvalued 🤷‍♀️

You'd see some things drop out of favour at exactly the wrong time (while they are down in price) like those energy stocks.Bogleheads would probably be pretty constant, though you might see things like small cap value ETFs go into and out of favour.Dividends this year would be SCHD, JEPI, O, and some other individual stocks.  JEPI will probably get replaced by whatever the next hot, high yield ETF comes along just like the xYLDs have fallen out of favour.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:42:38'] MSFT - I think they have an incredible MOAT. In my opinion,  their offerings are the most iron clad relative to economic conditions. Their investment in OpenAI only makes me that much more excited about future possibilities.Having said that? These are all amazing companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 10:12:50'] Out of those three I would say Microsoft. Best diversification, best moat, and has segments that are crucial to government operations meaning it’s backed by the government to the extent of they won’t let Microsoft fail. Apple is very dependent on hardware sales since that is how they get users into their ecosystem. And as for their hardware comparable alternatives are available creating some risk there. All it takes is a few missteps on the hardware side for Apple to crack. Amazon e-commerce is low margin but they do have AWS which is high margin.  Overall amazons success weighs heavy on AWS. Amazon does have data on users like shopping habits and previous purchases to help drive ad sales. Microsoft products are heavily integrated into most people lives to the point where there is no real comparable alternative and these offerings are through so many different segments. This is why I would say Microsoft is the strongest of the three. As for the mega cap with the biggest upside I would say alphabet as of right now. They have multiple growth segments like cloud, AI, driverless tech, healthcare, search, YouTube, and so much more. On top of it they are trading at the lowest valuation of all the mega caps right now. But to the original question Microsoft for sure in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 12:05:00'] This is a tough choice. MSFT is the best value of the 3 currently and has a nice dividend for the tech space. And all three choices aren’t going away IMO.However, if I had to pick one, I’d go with AMZN. You’ve got Walmart, CVS and Alphabet rolled into one conglomerate with AMZN. The logistics tentacles that the company has cast a wide moat alone, not to mention its other diversified operations.The only thing I don’t love about AMZN is the P/E ratio currently.

Basically, I am waiting until their P/Es are favorable which means MSFT needs to be at $200 and AAPL needs to be between $100 - $110.  Earnings will be a big decider of that and since MSFT has announced a layoff, I'm pretty sure their quarter announcement will be bad since I've never heard of a company announcing positive earnings and a layoff at the same time.  I'm avoiding Amazon until Jassey can finish cutting all the costs that Besos implemented. AMZN needs to go to at least $60 for the valuation to make sense.All of these numbers might take forever and I'm willing to wait.The one that is the closest on a valuation level, for me, is actually GOOGL at a 19/20 PE.  Fair value is only about $10 lower than it's at right now, and again, another great company.  I think I'll be investing in GOOGL before the others solely based on valuation and how fast the stocks get to fair value.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 13:20:21'] I’d go with AAPL because they have very loyal customers who now pay monthly fees for all sorts of services and whose data is hidden from other services. It would be damn hard to meaningfully compete with them. Note I use Windows every day for engineering, used to own a Windows Phone, and am typing on only my second iPhone. I’m not a fanboy, but no body matches Apple for seamless integration.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 16:37:21'] MSFT is safest of these 3 based on dominance in business software, reasonable P/E ratio and dividend. APPL too dependent on consumers. AMZN P/E way to high.

Having said that, I’ve always have gone with Apple phones and products and will continue to do so. If my IPhone died (during a time that happened to be in recession) and I had to get a new phone, I wouldn’t NOT get an IPhone just to save a few bucks during a bad economy. I’m guessing 9/10 loyal Apple users would feel the same way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 12:32:01'] MSFT. All of AAPL’s revenue streams are married to iPhone market share. That’s fantastic for now, but is subject to disruption.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 17:14:47'] I’ve done a DCF for both AMZN and GOOG, do note I particularly love AMZN so take into account the slight subtle bias in my conclusion personally I wouldn’t put all my money into 1 stock because if one day FedEX/UPS and WMT decides to collaborate against AMZN I’m not really sure how well AMZN can hold up against them, given that the AMZN store business right now is still in a growing phase looking to cut costs through economies of scales, there is a possibility they may never be profitable enough to generate free cash flow but I like my odds on that.AMZN does have things going for it like AWS, it right now is the biggest player in the cloud space and is actually the one generating free cash flows for the firm. Advertising is one of their most recent venture in 2019, not much information was given on it but seems like cash for basically no additional costs. Word of caution for AMZN though, AMZN has been in negative free cash flows for the past 2 years. Reason given by management is because they’ve doubled their network focusing more on growth, profits later. If you like their mantra you could consider digging more into AMZNAs for GOOG, 80% of their revenue comes from advertising. Advertising is a cyclical business. Meaning when the economy tanks, GOOG goes down with it as well.The good thing about GOOG is that it’s a software company so the main bulk of cost should come from R&D there shouldn’t be very high costs required to maintain the servers, so once products get through GOOG just has to wait on cash to flow in, their margins have been consistently 20+% for the past 5-6 years compared to AMZN’s 2-5% iirc.The most exciting thing for GOOG is that it’s looking to break into different modal for search. If tech is more of your thing GOOG would probably be your best bet.I know you asked about AAPL, MSFT and AMZN but I haven’t had a look at AAPL and MSFT so Iwouldn’t want to feed you misinformation.

Thats its nature. So anyone counting on them still being on top in say 40-50 years will be disappointed. Odds are none of them will remain on top.Risk mitigation is the name of the investment game. There is a reason why staple businesses are highly valuated despite slow growth. The only company that has any semblance of staple businesses is Amazon.

They will dominate that market as they did with mp3 players and cell phones. They have a decent relationship with China and when their AR or VR headset ships , China will gobble it up. Sending sales into the stratosphere. They have not announced any layoffs yet while the other two companies combined plan to lay off like 30000 people. That alone demonstrates that apple brass was smart enough not to over hire. Titans like MSFT and AMZN laying off employees looks embarrassing to me. Full disclosure - I own all three companies, however I own about 10 times as much apple as I do the others.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 18:08:04'] Consider this an assessment more of how these stock tickers will do, not how good the companies are, or their businesses are...AAPL is not down that much, nor is MSFT.But AMZN stock certainly has been pummelled.  They've been recently hated as a company and a stock.  That typically is a setup for a strong bounce.We've seen it over and over.  Facebook was getting daily coverage for their evils, their idiot owner tripled down on "metaverse" and then the stock cratered.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.  They didn't change or fix anything.  They just waited for the spotlight to move.Tesla was ludicrously overvalued, and has a psychotic fascism cheerleader and Russian puppet owner.  Product quality tanked along with reputation, and there's strong competition everywhere.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.Nvidia hit a chip glut and people realized a lot of their business was from selling wildly overpriced silicon for unsustainable crypo.  Yet it's had a 100% rebound on... nothing, really.Netflix was mismanaged and hid the fact they hit customer saturation years ago and price saturation too.  Their desperate response was to call customers thieves for doing password sharing NFLX had always encouraged, then an incompetent money-losing ad-tier launch which, at best, cannibalizes themselves for low value customers and negative revenue.  Shady execs now pledging to hide the subscriber numbers.  Stock is up 150%.So while I don't have confidence in Amazon to fix their business problems (like how most of their site and experience is just displaying datafeed entries of third party offshore knockoff junk and counterfeit product inserted into their broken fulfillment structure) I would say that if it's anything like how the other floundering large "tech" companies have seen their stock price go parabolic without reason, they're in the best position for senseless rebound.

Ive done penny stocks and options where Ive sat and stared at charts all day, tried to hold long term investments with the little money I had, and basically turned 400 into 600. \n\nThis was mainly meant as practice for when I graduated university so I was familiar with investing without risking much and Id like some opinions on my current idea for an investment strategy. I opened a brokerage account (not IRA) on Fidelity after switching from RH and plan on either doing: 100 in SPY, VOO, AAPL, and AMZN or just 200 in SPY and VOO. Then eventually try and hold in the money SPY calls 6 months to a year out once I build more capital. \n\nIm also aware that Im young, inexperienced, and dont really have anyone to go to with investing experience. Any advice Id appreciate!'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 08:42:03'] This is the best advice you will ever get: when you get a job, put some FU money aside to cover 3 months of your expenses. You do that then proceed to max out your 401(k) with whatever broad based market index fund if you can. If you can manage that, open a tIRA and max that with whatever broad based market index fund. If you can manage that, open a regular brokerage and max that with whatever broad based index fund. Stocks, Options, or whatever. Pfft. You’ll get a better return if you focus on your career and keep dumping money into your index funds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 05:49:59'] Why would you have a position in SPY and VOO at the same time? Their holdings and weightings are basically the same. The charts are identical.PSSPY/SP500 will drop to 320-330 before the end of the year. She's repeating a similar bearish pattern to the 2000 dotcom bubble. Short SPY / long SPDN

POST_TEXT: b'Year end and Im down 19%. My 5 year old daughter is down 14%! For comparison sake the S&P500 is down 18.11%. She has a Schwab UGMA account and gets $50/mo and has been picking a stock a month since she turned 4 (20 months ago). Her picks are just random brands she knows of (Apple, Disney, Nike, Starbucks, Coke, Tyson, Dominos, Netflix, Google, Marriott, Target, McDonalds, etc) and usually driven by questions like, can I buy cheese pizza or dinosaur chicken stock? And can I buy YouTube stock? Or mom shops at Target and I like the vanilla milkshake at Starbucks.\n\nIm seriously considering just copying her buys each month. Id be better off.\n\nEdit: many were asking for a list of her holdings. Here you go.\n\nATVI, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, DPZ, MAR, MCD, MSFT, NFLX, NKE, NVDA, PTON, PG, SBUX, TGT, TSLA, KO, TSN, DIS\n\nSome above shes bought multiple months. DIS is her largest position, followed by SBUX, NFLX, and GOOG. Some are smaller because she bought a few each months with the Schwab'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 12:09:44'] It sounds like your 5 year old daughter has been crushing it in the stock market, with a portfolio that's down only 14% this year despite the S&P 500 being down 18.11%. I mean, seriously, how many 5 year olds can say they've outperformed the S&P 500? Not many, that's for sure. In fact, I'm thinking of just copying her investment strategy. I mean, who wouldn't want to follow the lead of a kid who's making investment picks based on her love of cheese pizza and vanilla milkshakes?    Of course, it's worth keeping in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results, and that no one – not even a 5 year old – has a crystal ball when it comes to the stock market. But hey, if your daughter's portfolio continues to beat the S&P 500, I might just have to start taking investment advice from her too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 14:02:15'] smart: so she is ignoring all smallcaps and most midcaps and going for half staples and with companies with strong balance sheet and strong fcf+she is well diversified with +10 stocks, 15-20 is the sweet spot.ill say that approach is better than going with the sp500, i would re ask every Q if she still likes every company or if she would like to add more but by dropping the one she likes less.\+make her a pie chart with all picked companies so she can drop one to add one more if she wants. Which is better than just adding all the ones she likes and ending up with +50 companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 02:48:10'] It's tough if your investment strategy only involves stocks and only from a long perspective.  You might want to try doing some spread trades.  Short one company and buy another in the same sector.  Like short McDonald's and long Wendy's (obviously have to do math to make the positions equal). With your daughters diversity, it's great she is learning and would agree to continue this road, but for you, you might as well buy the index.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 05:37:22'] I wanna do this with my child but not sure if I want them to be able to take over at 18. I want them to understand investing though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 07:36:02'] So uh, what’s she buying next?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 07:43:47'] children generally do better stock picking since the brands they're interested in typically are main-stream things all kids at that age like. since kids like it parents buy it and the companies do well. older people have developed their own tastes and also are typically "out-of-touch". also, if kids jump on something it normally does well. if they complain enough their parents will buy and if the parents have deep enough pockets they might sink in a lot of money to keep their kids happy. so, yeah, I would trust a kid to know what's hip and what to invest in
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:09:54'] Yeah... if you like the product other people might too. Good product is foundational to a solid profitable company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:30:25'] Wow OP this is a great idea for young kids. Absolutely love this. I’m sure they don’t quite fully understand what they are doing but it’s a great way for them to learn and invest at the same time. Not for nothing but I bet you here portfolio does well for a long time. She’s clearly picking the biggest and smartest companies out there! When I have kids I plan on copying this method
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 09:53:28'] Do you lead her to say a specific brand? Using your examples as my examples: "Can I buy YouTube stock?". Do you just go like "uuh sure" and buy GOOG, or do you kinda explain how it works to her? For cheese pizza, do you tell her she can't invest only in cheese pizza, and do you just buy the pizza stock you like the most?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 10:41:52'] Not bad at all. I’d teach her about dividends for growth and since you got her started early she’s gonna be well off by the time she hits adulthood if that snowball begins

Im familiar with some, just was wondering what your guys favorites are. Thanks!'
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 20:14:10'] I don’t compare them, I buy both. I’m a poor lil bitch so I only own 1 share each like a clown but I love them both equally. If I had a gun to my head and had to choose one, I’d choose google.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 18:01:03'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 18:50:14'] You can't really compare them, but I'll just go ahead and say that I love GOOG. Why? They have a monopoly on web traffic with Google search, a monopoly on video sharing with YouTube, and a duopoly in the mobile OS market. The weakest components of their business are their cloud services and advertising, solely because of the competition Amazon and Facebook pose respectively. Let that sink in. The FLOOR for Google is its cloud services (growing 47% YOY) and advertising.From a fundamentals perspective, GOOG is trading at the same P/E as AAPL but is growing its revenue exponentially faster. When I say "exponentially" faster I mean that literally. Seriously, look at their respective YOY revenue growth charts on macrotrends. You could argue AAPL is simply overpriced, but so is everything else. In this overpriced market, GOOG is trading at a discount.Disclosure: Not financial advice. I own shares of GOOG and options in GOOGL
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-02 08:20:28'] Lotta people making compelling arguments for both companies so I decided to buy MSFT.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-02 00:12:45'] Worked at both for quite sometime. If you put a gun to my head and made me pick where I put all my money, it would go to AMZN 7 days a week and twice on Sundays - I’d sleep like a baby.AMZN culture is basically designed to grow and grow. GOOG is a grad student’s fever dream. AMZN has consistently shown an ability to enter and succeed in new segments (started as an online bookstore, now run the internet... somehow?). GOOG had a great search engine, monetized it with ads and... that’s mostly it for the last couple of decades, I guess?GOOG has a golden goose, AMZN is a goose factory.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 23:14:58'] AMZNThey are not easily comparable businesses though. In a more traditional sense AMZN is a retail business and Alphabet is essentially an advertising platform.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-02 04:32:48'] My guess is as good as others, but i would say Amazon if <3-4yrs perspective and Google if time perspective is longer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 19:27:13'] I lazily check Amazons Price/FCF ratio and make sure there is steady growth ahead. Google I just look at PE and how it compares to historical and PEG values. Right now I view Amazon as a better deal and own it, it is trading in the bottom half of its historical price to FCF. I do not own Google and see it as overvalued. You can also do a DCF on the two.Finally on the qualitative front I see Amazon as the more durable and innovative company with much more runway to growth and it isn’t even close. Edit: Saw a lot on here saying you can’t compare these stocks. That’s nonsense. Of course you can compare them (DCF, financial metrics, comps, qual analysis) and one is a better purchase than the other.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 18:16:39'] In this case, I have shares and calls in Amazon and Facebook.  Google just sat around like a dead fish for so long that I gave up on it.  FB has all kinds of headline risk, but it's printing money with a low PE relative to growth rate, and has yet to really monetize Whatsapp.  Amazon is just one of those companies that is growing and they keep reinvesting in that growth.  The profits are starting to show, but if they were focused on profits they would be making more and have a better PE.So...I don't have Google because FB is in the same space (ad revenue primary driver).  Amazon is really in a category all its own.  If you really must choose between the two...what's your holding period?  If you're trading, FB has violent ups and downs (Google may start to behave a bit more erratic as well).  Amazon tends to build a base and then explode like a coiled spring.  I honestly expect them both to have a great April.  I'm more likely to sell FB when the next move up is done, however.  AMZN more of a long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 18:12:17'] Like comparing two unlike companies?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 18:09:31'] I think one can make money on both.But between AMZN and Google I like AMZN. Google is considered a pseudo reopening play as travel and entertainment related search revenue will go up.But I feel YouTube which had a blowout year in 2020 will not be as profitable when people are not looking at their phones 8 hours a day. Google also has a anti trust lawsuit, which I feel they will get away with but there might be some repercussions and also the ongoing hearings haven't given them any good PR.AMZN also has made money from all the deliveries but that is more habit forming. Some people will go back to stores but overall getting things delivered is easier regardless of pandemic. AMZN also is getting into sports broadcasting. AWS continuous to grow and the new CEO is coming from AWS. Amazon has been fighting against Senators on Twitter but honestly they can. They already pay the $15 min wage. So if a law to that effect gets into effect they don't really lose anything.Corporate tax increase will hurt both equally at a high level. AMZN might suffer more but overall I feel AMZN will rise more.Some factors I consider while choosing among similar companies - P/E ratio and/or PSR. Plans for future. Possible market share growth, management team, short/long term government impacts (this may not be restricted to US government). Potential meaningful lawsuits etc.Disclaimer : This Not financial advice. Please consult a professional financial advisor..

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 16:19:43'] This is great news for Amazon investors, honestly. A lot of these tech companies could shave off a large workforce because many of what these workers are doing aren't essential to the business. It's just a 'project' that they're working on. The problem is when costs increase and there is a looming recession, you need tangible projects that deliver money. My brother works in tech. There's a whole bunch of tech workers who honestly sit at home doing nothing. I'd estimate they probably only work 2-3 hours per day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 07:06:54'] Any tech workers let go will quickly find new jobs - at banks, brokerage houses, manufacturing companies, insurance, etc, etc.   These places haven't been able to get tech staff in years - all their best employees quit and took jobs at Amazon and Google!

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 18:25:36'] Buy and hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 18:41:04'] You have held it for less than 6 months.  All time favorite.  Stock don’t go up everyday or every week.  The price does not always reflect the underlying business, that is where the opportunity is. If you think it is cheap , load up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 05:24:16'] It’s my second biggest holding. Iv it had it for like 4-5 years. I have very high conviction sometimes these things just need to cool off and consolidate it’s for the best imo. I actually added to it for the first time since 2016 when it went under 3k. It’s hard to know what valuation the market will give them going forward but I still see 25%+ eps growth for years to come.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 11:18:10'] I don't think anyone touched on you adding a share to your Roth. I fought with myself when I started buying AMZN... the plan was to buy and hold... forever. I thought about putting it in my Roth but decided ultimately to just buy AMZN in my brokerage account. I look at them and all the revenue streams they have. I think they have plenty of room to grow. I kept it to my brokerage so that as the years go by if I ever want to take a little profit I can. The only thing I worry about is if the government ever decides to break AMZN up(every time the topic comes up, Bezos and AMZN are always first in line). AMZN will be fine but I wonder what that would look like for the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-26 12:03:39'] I can understand the frustration for someone who bought it around $3200-$3400. This stock has been consolidating for past 8 months now. DO NOT sell no matter what. There is absolutely nothing about the company has changed, just look at their last 3 earnings. They are expanding and growing substantially. People who are selling are idiots, and people who are not buying are also idiots. This is going to create a new base around $4000. You do not want to miss the uptrend when it happens. I don't know when it will, but it absolutely will happen when wallstreet realize that its undervalued for how much it has been growing.

At this point, they will never be dethroned in their vertical.  I plan on holding my Amazon for the next 50 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 18:47:26'] Don’t worry about it being flat, but I’d be ready to have cash to shore up a position if it drops.I bought 1600 and 1800 for my two lots.  It stayed around there for a while, then broke away after last march’s drop.  It could take a while to break past the new barrier, but like any stock, it could be a rocky way on the way up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 19:44:33'] I usually use price to free cash flow as a lazy indicator to buy Amazon. Right now they’re a slightly good deal compared to historicals. I think there’s a decent chance they drop when things open up (which may be a good time to buy). I think if you buy this one now in five years you’ll be ahead regardless.Edit: I can count on one hand the number of growth companies I own. Amazon is one of them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 01:50:54'] I am extremely bullish on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I read somewhere half of the internet runs on AWS. Every time you use the internet, you are paying a tiny fee to Amazon. Covid only accelerated the pace of adoption of digital transformation technologies. More companies will conduct their businesses online. With Starlink and satellite internet, more people will have access to the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 04:45:08'] So I'm up about 50% on Amazon, all of these gains happened about 6 months ago, been pretty up and down / flat since then.&#x200B;IMO the chance of missing out on a sudden pop is too much of a risk, so although I have a lot of my portfolio in Amazon I'm willing to wait on this one. Only a matter of time before  a rally.

POST_TEXT: b'I\'ve held AMZN forever. When it splits, it\'s just "funny math", right?, I\'m no better off, no worse off.

Got it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut -- for USA IRS short-term vs. long-term capital gains calculations of any subsequent sales -- what is the purchase date of any new stocks? Split date?, or my original purchase date of the pre-split stocks?\n\nI.e. am I given 19 new stocks for each stock I held? Or are my existing stocks each replaced with 20 with purchase date details of the original stock? If the former, is my new holding date the date I\'m given the 19 new stock (I.e. the date they split, the date I\'m "given 19 new stocks"), ... or backdated to when I purchased the original?\n\nI\'m pretty sure the purchase date of the new stock can\'t be the stock-split date? Surely? But I can\'t find anything definitive.\n\nThanks,'
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-14 09:53:37'] Not sure if anyone here answered his question about capital gains.From [Zacks.com](https://Zacks.com)"When you receive additional shares because of a stock split, the new shares are considered to have the same holding period as the original shares. Therefore, if you decide to sell tomorrow all of your shares after a stock split, and the original shares were purchased more than a year ago, the resulting loss or gain would be considered long term. "
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-14 08:57:13'] *Shares* are the pieces that you own, not “stocks.” You own shares of Amazon stock.This being said, all of your lots remain the same. You are not given new shares. The split-adjusted share count and basis are used for any future sale transactions.If you bought 10 shares with a basis of $2000 per share, that lot is now considered 200 shares with a basis of $100 per share.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-14 09:17:33'] Correct, whatever you hold on one day, will be split up into equal pieces on the following day. However, markets tend to like splits and generally there is a bit of a run-up towards the split.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-14 09:17:50'] Stock splits don't change your purchase date.  For taxable events, what matters is your cost basis:  if you paid $10000 to get $10 shares then your cost basis for 1 share is $1000.  If you sell 3 shares for $4000, you realized $1000 in taxable capital gains.If it does a 20-to-1 split, your cost basis is still $10000 (amount you paid originally) but now your cost basis per share is $10000/200 (the new amount of shares) = $50 per share.  If you sell 3 shares for $180 you realized $30 in taxable capital gains.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-07 15:07:10'] Savings accounts don’t even pay enough to keep up with inflation, moving your money to one guarantees that you lose value over the long term. If you don’t need the money right now, hold that stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:41:59'] Understand that you're double/Triple dipping.$SPY contains all the stocks you've listed. So, you are weighting your portfolio towards tech. This is perfectly fine, as long as you understand it's what you're doing.ARKK is giving you TSLA exposure as well.Your portfolio is pretty correlated. i.e : $SPY goes up, most of the stocks go up. $SPY goes down - most of the stocks go down. Look into some defensive plays as well. Tech has outperformed in the last decade, but does not have to. I'd add a commodity / Precious metal etf to balance things out a bit.On a side note, I wish I had the financial sense to start at your age.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:46:06'] I’d recommend you liquidate right away - then:Keep 10% for investing in companies. Invest in only your top 3 ideas90% put it all in the Vanguard total market index fund (one holding)Over time contribute every month to both funds. Of monthly contributions: 90% monthly to vanguard and 10% to companies fund. Once you’ve read and gained experience and after you’ve been through 1) a big stock boom2) a huge crash/recession3) a period of extreme low volatilityThen you adjust your 90-10 breakdown, put more in stocks. But always invest in just your top 3 ideas. Why put money in your 4th best idea?Best of luckAlso - keep in mind when you read in the news that we’re “officially” (not likely or maybe) but officially in a recession - as in have gone through 2 quarters of negative GDP in the past! Then you double or triple contributions monthly. You make your fortune in recessions. 99% of people won’t have the mental fortitude and gut strength and foresight (keep cash and your job available) to do that. Be that 1% and do the above and you’ll make a fortune in no time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:44:44'] Good job.  I'd toss ARKK and substitute XSD or one of the other semiconductor ETFs.I'd also suggest having one share of XLK and QQQ to just compare your whole portfolio against.  QQQ could be a stand-in for META/GOOG/TSLA/AMZN/COST and XLK for AAPL/MSFT/NVDA/AMD.  Longterm it is a good idea to have an industry base ETF (like QQQ and XLK for "tech") and then go heavier with individual stocks.  You kinda do that by holding SPY, but it is a pretty small part of your portfolio at this point.Obviously you like tech, and so do I.  Having some diversity beyond tech, like KO, is good but don't worry too much about it until you have at least $xx,xxx in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:02:34'] ARKK is junk, imo. She's selling hype. Otherwise you're basically in big tech, plus KO, COST, and VZ. Why did you choose those?I'd imagine you could just buy QQQ and have similar results with less risk. Or just put it all in SPY, since you are basically buying the biggest parts of SPY. Also, VOO has a much lower expense ratio than SPY for essentially the same thing. You might want to review expense ratios.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:30:43'] Those are obviously fine companies.  The only criticism is that most are all very large cap technology companies.  The future growth may or may not be there.  For example AAPL is not going to increase by 32,000% or whatever again.  Same with AMZN.   It’s mathematically impossible.I’m a bit closer to retirement and would no doubt be happy with all of these in my portfolio.  Most are thru a large cap fund.   You may want to consider more in SPY or find some growth ETF’s.  I see ARKK but just hate Cathie she buys some duds.   Anyways, great job keep it up.  Was just commenting to make a point and give you something to think about.

I think they have the best in class product and based on the recent earning call I think the next 6-12 months sees major progress with OEMs and tier 1 clients.Do what's best for you, and don't blindly take advice on here. Do your research and make sure your comfortable with the risk
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:30:55'] At 19, I would suggest you add dividend paying stocks to your portfolio, growth stocks are okay. But with monthly/quarterly dividends, that you can reinvest into more shares, you have more control and can begin building a passive income that will only keep growing over time
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:34:43'] My advice.  Get rid of all your stocks.  Just stick to your 80/20 VTI/ VXUS.  Invest each month into whatever is lagging to keep it 80/20 each month FOREVER.  That's it.  Then focus on what is more important to be rich.... Your education, job, income, savings, and LBYM.  Below is a link from JPM own private wealth arm concluding after looking at last 35 years of all individual stock returns they can't even suggest adding a concentrated portfolio to their OWN clients!  https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:27:22'] Not very diversified, is it? Not any criticism, but I would more diversify. Have you thought about some ETF's so spread is bigger? I just see a lot of tech and mainstream stocks!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:17:05'] Oh god ARKKOther picks look okay enough, but I’d do VOO over SPY
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:33:58'] TSLA & ARKK\- TSLY follows TSLA plus it provides monthly div\- OARK tracks ARKK ETF and has monthly div.If TSLA and ARKK turn south you still have div income, if they head north div is more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:21:08'] It's a lot of holdings. Large caps too. First, throw away ARKK, seriously. Then put whatever you want to keep low-risk in SPY, BRKB, VOO, VXUS or VTI, and try to add some risk to your portfolio. You're 19, find a company you like, understand (maybe in the field you're studying or working in today) and think is promising, then put some money you're willing to lose in it. Sell some covered calls for income if you like.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:56:03'] What you are doing is create your own ETF. There is nothing wrong with this strategy as long as you focus on those stocks and don’t expand them into a hundred, then you end up with a lot of little. Also I see some of your stocks pay dividends. Make sure you reinvest them. Finally, stay away from shady stocks like biopharma, they are very risky. You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term? It does pay great dividends but for the past several years has done nothing so although a stock like that may be good for an older investor looking for a steady dividend paying stock, at 19 it’s not a good thing, you don’t need dividends, you need growth. Also if you like a particular sector, get ETFs, and don’t shy away for an S&P ETF, or small caps, historically they have done well.

Thanks,'
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 18:11:38'] Just buy $5K of VOO.The top 6 holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet A and C. Those 6 make up about 20-21% of the total holdings.So, you’ll be using that $5,000 to get access to Amazon and Google as well as about 498 of the largest companies in the world and get some diversification along with it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 15:47:36'] A 10% gain is a 10% gain whether it’s on half a share of Amazon (~ $1600) or 100 shares of a $16 stock. In both cases your gain is roughly 10%.I think the thought for most people is it’s “easier” for a $16 stock to double to $32 than it is for a $3,200 stock to double to $6,400. But ultimately for a stock to double its market cap is hard regardless of the initial stock price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 15:32:52'] You could always just find a fund thats heavy in both Amazon And Google...So you can get both as well as invest in a bunch of other companies as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 16:19:32'] If you want to "set it and forget it" I'd recommend something like VTI.  Almost nobody beats the market picking stocks, so you'll outperform most people and save yourself lots of time. Just add more into VTI every month. Check the balance in 10 years and you'll be very happy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 15:05:24'] If you use fidelity you can do fractional to get exposure and still diversify

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 14:18:09'] who is schwab anyway?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 15:01:47'] I have Charles schwab their ratings are pretty much useless. It’s worth factoring in like 1% of your analysis but I would look at Morningstar more. It’s best to do your own analysis and just compare. Amazon is a great company you’ll be fine there with a long ter mentality. Also c doesn’t mean declining just average return projections.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 18:12:50'] Schwab's ratings change in the short term.  It's probably because Amazon has had a run up recently.  If you look at the 1 year chart, Amazon has consolidated and gone nowhere in the last 6 months.  Amazon is likely to continue to currently consolidate, and Schwab is just saying that now is not the best time to purchase Amazon.  I'm eyeing NVDA for purchase, and I believe it will likely correct back to it's most recent consolidation around 510.  Best of luck.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 00:13:25'] On the mobile app, when you click on the rating it brings you to pdf's that's has an easy table on what their ratings mean. C means that schwab rates it a hold. Which sounds pretty logical to me
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 14:48:58'] Depends if you believe they will retain the 60% growth they got from covid. Shwab doesn’t. Personally I don’t either. Obviously they’re a stellar company but covid was an ultimate short-term catalyst for them that is going to slowly retract as the vaccines continue to be rolled out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:48:34'] Would look at the analysts as an aggregate. You’re going to get some outliers and sounds like Schwab is one of those. I think analyst ratings aren’t all that useful (don’t write them completely off but they’re usually pretty skewed and in accurate). I believe the average price target for Amazon is a shade under $4K.It’s no secret Amazon competes on price, Bezos has been upfront about this since its founding - I’m paraphrasing but he knows for certain in twenty years customers will want products cheaper and faster. There is still tremendous runway for growth, we’re only in the second or third inning for AWS and probably the fourth or fifth inning for e-commerce.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 14:51:13'] Yea amazon is not a c. I work for amazon and they have been busy this year and I live in Canada.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 14:27:38'] The question is how much online traffic Amazon will retain after retail stores are allowed to fully reopen. I still prefer to look at actual clothing items in person rather than purchasing them sight unseen online. Ditto for furniture.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 14:52:13'] I wouldn’t be taking investment advice from Schwab...
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 18:24:12'] amazon is going to be the biggest company in the world. Buy it if you like money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 17:53:06'] As with all purchases, it depends whether you're looking at this as a short to medium-term trade or a long-term hold.  Schwab and most analysts give their assessments based on near-term (within a year) predictions.  That's why you see analysts flip-flop so much -- they change their analysis based on the quarterly data.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 12:21:27'] I have zero confidence in them.  I’ve watched this stock like a Hawk for about a year.  Since July, it has been the worst of the big names and it isn’t even close.  I have approximately $29k invested in it and am down about 8% since July.  These target prices of $4-$5k are bogus if you ask me.  I doubt it reaches $4k in the next 2 years, and at this rate I wouldn’t be surprised if it sinks to $2500 and never breaks $3500 again.  It’s the first stock to sink deep into red territory and the last to go green.  When it does go green it quickly gives it up.  It’s god awful stock to own and I regret it every day.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-07 09:23:17'] MSFT is an absolute giant. It's extremely stable and diversified, it won't lose value easily. But because it's so massive and established, it does not suddenly make sharp turns.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-30 16:49:03'] It's of course incredibly important to not put all your eggs in one basket... but 'bubble bursting' on the tech sector is not something that would play out like the .dot com burst in the early 2000s.  Speculators were literally lining up to give anyone with an Internet idea their money, the sector was full of junk companies.  Now you have companies like MSFT, AMZN, etc that are incredibly solid companies that will rise and fall with the markets and independently based on their own performance... but the likelihood that one day everyone is like this 'Internet/Computer' thing is going nowhere and just pull their money out of the sector is very unlikely. But adding an ETF that isn't tech heavy as part of a balanced portfolio is a good idea... I'll be watching/researching the ideas here.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-30 21:59:38'] I think the concept of "tech sector" is outdated, because the companies within it do such different things at the same time that what is labelled as "technology" is much more central to to the economy overall. In respect to the second point, if "tech" tanks the whole damn market is going down with it, so it's pointless to try to hedge your bets against a collapse (though that doesn't mean you shouldn't diversify).

I really want to lCLN and other solar related stocks but IMO they are overbought currently. However they could continue to be overbought for up to a few years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 16:15:06'] I think I jumped in a bit early at $53 & of course it started to dip but I like the stock since it’s similar to alibaba & Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 19:09:09'] While it’s a great company, it is significantly overpriced imo. At the current market cap, it’s the second largest Korean company, which is absolutely mindboggling when compared to other top Korean companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 13:30:44'] The way I think about it is "if I had $X in cash, would I use all of it to buy my employer's stock today?" If you answer is "no", you probably want to sell and diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 12:37:44'] The way that I handle RSU’s is that I sell them as soon as they vest and diversify that money into index funds.RSU’s, upon vesting, are taxed as ordinary income so you only pay capital gains/losses on changes in value after they’ve vested so in that sense some people think of them as simply a cash bonus.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 12:48:24'] Thanks for the advice y’all, I think I’m going to start by selling half and reinvesting that into VTI

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-19 17:34:04'] I usually sell my RSU within the same trading window.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 16:25:36'] I think Amazon is a strong buy right now, and will offer more returns over a 1-5yr period than VTI or any of those other companies. It's been consolidating in a relatively tight range for about 10 months, which is a relatively short time in mega-cap stock timeframes.Wanting to have more cash is a real issue to consider. But if this is a long term account then you couldn't really put your cash in an investment which offers a better combination of safety and growth prospects.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-03 18:59:46'] When you're talking that much market cap across so many companies, you're better off going w/ index funds IMO. AMZN, GOOG, DIS, and MSFT combine to form 14% of the S&P 500. Further, if they're all moving upward, there's almost 100% chance most of the rest of the S&P is doing the same.  However, particularly in the case of AMZN and GOOG, there's regulatory and political headwinds that could disproportionately impact those companies, and owning the index funds as a whole mitigates that risk. If you're looking to beat the market, do a bunch of research about valuations and top-down sector and industry assessments. Put 50-70 percent of your money into index funds and put the rest into the 2 or 7 longer-shot, off-the-radar plays that you expect to beat the market by a lot. Overweighting into AMZN or AAPL isn't going to be the answer.

Part of me thinks that the huge cash flows they're generating now are from the platforms they developed a long time ago, and now those cash flows are peaking. Because it's just ads where this money comes from, there's not really a product they're selling. Whereas microsoft and Amazon are selling products and the ad revenue is just on the side. And LinkedIn is likely going to be the biggest social media site in a few years, bing is taking market share from Google etc. Google is an example that cash flows aren't everything, and you would need to look at the future story of the company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 12:20:18'] Investors can buy Amazon stock in Canadian dollarsThe NEO Exchange introduced one new and very interesting ticker on Tuesday morning. That ticker is labeled AMZN (Amazon.com CDR (CAD Hedged)). Over 8,000 units had changed hands by midday with settlement within the $22.80-$23.28 price range.Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) has introduced more trading convenience to Canadian investors through a currency-hedged Canadian Depository Receipt (CDR) series on Amazon.com common shares.Canadian Depository Receipts are certificates issued by domestic banks representing shares in foreign-listed companies. The CDR affords investors the opportunity to hold shares in the equity of foreign companies and to trade such shares on local exchanges.Amazon hasn’t directly listed its common stock in Canada yet, but local investors have the opportunity to buy AMZN stock in Canadian dollars thanks to the NEO Exchange and CIBC’s latest innovation.Local investors who are concerned about associated foreign currency risks, and those who don’t like incurring foreign currency conversion costs when buying the U.S-listed company’s shares now have a local alternative.Most noteworthy, the new CDRs allow for fractional share ownership on AMZN. You don’t have to raise over $4,600 to buy just one share in Jeff Bezos’s online retail business anymore. Just $25 can get you into the game, and you can participate in Amazon’s future growth story with a much lower cash outlay. - Source: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/investor-alert-canadians-buy-amazon-180050598.html

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 20:03:34'] Counterpoint: Disney hasn't developed any original IP in years and is desperately pumping out sequels and retreads of past hits. But audiences are getting tired of endless Marvel movies; Star Wars films are all in development hell, and they managed to alienate everyone with their handling of the sequel trilogy; the Mandalorian can't go on forever and none of the other SW series have had one tenth the cultural impact; there's no evidence audiences are hyped for a geriatric Indiana Jones; the Willow series flopped; and they can only make so many live action versions of animated classics before The Black Cauldron is all that's left.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 21:43:17'] Disney has a major issue because of 2 factors - they are going to begin paying taxes in a different bracket because of their ongoing issues with the state (I’m not taking sides it’s a fact) AND ESPN is not doing doing well. They are paying enormous premiums to carry live sporting events and being hindered by high costs to retain the program while other networks chip away at their product. Disney plus is not nearly the revenue driving force people believe it to be yet. With the leadership change recently I believe you will see a more streamlined Disney product which will help but I do not think the stock is as slam dunk as many think.

Not to mention their declining cable business, which has historically been an absolute money printer.As other people have stated, Disney hasn't been too innovative recently- seemingly running out of new ideas.Disney is a common household name and a strong company from a consumer perspective, but a bad investment.

DIS appears to be rallying within a bearish direction. However, stock shares remain below a declining 200-day ma. It seems the future trend is lower lower. Comparative RSA shows that this issue is even worse than lackluster blue chip index. My position is it is a hold.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 05:55:28'] Their handling of the SW IP shows how they have ran out of ideas. The new trilogy was a dull reboot of the original with a mind-numbing story. They only managed to make decent movies when finally deviated from the Skywalker family. Otherwise they are producing horrible remakes to their old titles. For instance Frozen was such a hit, that I had to take my kid to the movies to watch it five times. And buy all the merchandise from Frozen backpack to Frozen pens. Yet Frozen 2 was such a flop that the same child watched it only once and never mentioned it again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 20:02:05'] Fun fact Disney has the same EV as 2014 before buying Fox. With 30billon more revenue now and should continue to grow into 100billion in revenue by 2025 if they manage to get back to there 15%ish free cash flow margin take some or leave some and use it to pay down debt and eventually start buying back shares and start a dividend like they were doing it could be a great play. So short story by 2025 it should have double the revenue as it did in 2014 ish but it’s currently worth the same. If they push free cash margin back up this combined with the buy backs and lowering debt can causing a pretty nice trifecta for gains. They are going to be doing 5.5 billion in cuts which helps but they really need to push Disney+ to profitable because right now it’s a huge loss leader. You just need to believe they can continue to drive cash flow and it will outperform the broader market for the next 5 years easy once the start having their cuts realized.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 20:16:42'] Agreed it's a good buy right now at $94 for the medium to long term, my main concern is macroeconomics, for all growth stocks not just DIS.

As Warren Buffet says it's not a popularity contest, you don't make money by disagreeing with everyone, I hate most people's opinions (I hate people overall) and it makes me money though sometimes also lose when I invest out of spite of everyone without thinking twice.When it comes to entertainment I'm more about Sony even though they have a monopolist on their neck now - Microsoft but still they have a nicely diversified portfolio through entertainment and hardware, it's one of a kind of a stock with such diversification because Microsoft besides Xbox doesn't have any hardware like Sony with cameras, lenses and TV's, I think they'd be able to join faang stocks if they were more ambitious in high margin markets.When it comes to Disney I'm not a fan of their physical business because it takes a lot of money and it's for priviledged rich snobs, although LVMH does well with milking the rich they also make a dollar on a penny selling worthless chinese cheap bags where Disney can't do that with parks since they have a real tangible value with upkeep to maintain.

So shitty.
	COMMENT: ['2019-10-25 07:58:20'] At a younger age i had similar thoughts as you... so i bought around 280 and then when they went up to 400 i told my dad like “i don’t think they can get higher than this i might as well cash out they’re probably gonna tumble just like they did when they crashed before”. Basically told me “time in the market /=/ timing the market” and that don’t try and predict selling or buying. If ya like it buy it. Advice is still great to this day.

	COMMENT: ['2019-10-25 07:10:14'] It's down like 3% today.  If you don't have enough faith in Amazon to believe it can overcome a 3% drop then you probably should never have invested in the first place.  I personally think it's priced to absolute perfection even with this drop, especially given their statements about what the next quarter is going to hold.  This same day shipping movement is going to cost them some cash but the idea is that it will position them better in the longer term.
	COMMENT: ['2019-10-25 14:17:46'] Did you know anything about Aws in 2014? Why did you want to buy Amzn. Just bc you biy shit on there or did you do your home work? Did you make any projections about where earnings/revenues/ user growth was going. If none of these apply then yes you could have made money buying amzn, you could have also made money buying appl or netfilx too, for similar reasons. But its mostly luck. The stock market isnt that easy all the time. The past several years i concecede buying anything tech related has worked tremendously well. But its not always like that. I could have bought amzn a lot lower, and i knew a whole lot about it (been a fan of aws since 2008), but i didnt understand thier business model, nor the valuation and i didnt put enough effort into trying to understand it. So no crying over spoiled milk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:00:40'] I'm an AMZN holder, and I believe Jassy will be a good CEO (maybe better than Bezos, since Jassy made the only profitable part of the company). One possibility to consider is that Bezos is leaving because he wants to work on other projects. For those projects, he'll need lots and lots of money. Where is his money? AMZN stock. So he might be selling his shares, thus depressing the price. Bill Gates did the same thing when he left MSFT, and ended up with fewer shares than Steve Ballmer. It's natural for AMZN to be horizontal for a while--it had an enormous run-up in 2020, then the news of Bezos leaving, and now a broad market sell-off due to treasury yield fears (which hurts growth companies like AMZN in particular). Personally, I think AMZN is amazingly undervalued right now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:29:00'] That’s a lot of writing
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:10:13'] The drop in AMZN has nothing to do with the new CEO and everything to do with the overall dip in the markets, particularly tech stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:28:39'] You’re assuming a lot by thinking the decline is due to the CEO announcement.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:35:42'] Worked at AWS for five years and sat in meetings with Jassy. Jeff wouldn’t of given him the company reigns if he wasn’t certain he could do it. Jassy is brilliant and can do the job, his style is a little different than Jeff’s but I don’t think outsiders know how pervasive Amazon culture is steeped in the company. There will be a steep learning curve and will take him a few years to learn the rest of the business but he will have Jeff looking over his shoulder. The recent dip has very little to do with the CEO change and more has to do with the macro environment. There is some belief that AMZN will dip as we reopen the economy. They’re also tied up in some of the high growth tech stock rotation.Amazon is a tricky one to value. It is one of the few stocks I don’t like to use a PE for just because there isn’t a great historical value and it is a slow and steady come-down over decades. They also are unstable in how much they reinvest back into the company, basically if they see something to their liking they give zero fucks about pouring money into it.I like price to free cash flow instead which tends to range from 40-80. Right now it is at 54 which isn’t terrible but isn’t a steal either. That said, the great thing about Amazon is it is growing so fast so if the price stays constant you’ll be in the 40’s by the end of the year.I would buy but would not be surprised with a 30% hit if it gets thrown out with the bath water if there is a QQQ crash. Long term this is a decade buy and hold stock. One of only three I subscribe that to: BAM, BRK, AMZN.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 03:21:38'] Hey man, I'm actually not gonna shit on it like the rest, each of those are some of the best companies in existence right now, they are just priced a little rich for most people's blood.And they likely have a point - if there aren't near-term surprise earnings beats there is a lot of potential for some dips.If that is something you are concerned about, don't want to get caught feeling like you bought the top, break up your buy into 3 or 4 pieces. Buy 1 piece now, and wait and see for maybe 2 week before the next piece and so on.I'm assuming you can afford the risk implied - but don't let pricing force you from buying a good company at a meh price to a meh company at a low price, IMO. People called tesla overvalued in 2017, but if you had vision and you understood their technological progress you made a killing. The people who sat around complaining about P/E just moved on to another thing to complain about - they will sound smart and they won't lose money, but they also aren't making any and risk missing generational wealth.Develop your own strategy and perspective and have conviction. Don't bet the farm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 14:23:08'] Firstly, Tesla is definitely overvalued. Don't buy it at this price.As for semi stocks, here's my thoughts. Nvidia is also overvalued. Even the company believes that their stock is expensive, as seen by their recent attempt to raise $10 billion in funding. Although Nvidia certainly has a bright future in terms of growth the stock is significantly expensive even when accounting for that growth, which is the major problem.  AMD in comparison is the best firm I am aware of at a fair price, so it's a good name to DCA into at these levels.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 14:26:14'] If you’re concerned I’d go 30% growth and large cap funds, and 70% money market
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 21:10:07'] To do a precise estimate is impossible and even educated financial advisors, funds or banks do not have a better performance than random picking.If you want to minimize your money loss, learn about macroeconomic situation and cycles first, to understand the fundamentals of the markets, human emotions (charts) and economy.After you will understand how various sectors behave in various stages of the economic cycle, you can do a bit better picks and lower the risk. After that, not before, you will do the specific analysis of a specific stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 13:31:06'] If you’re asking if you can buy all ofthese stocks at a cheaper price than they trade at today in the coming months, the answer is very likely yes.  No one can predict a crash, however it would seem to me that the speculative bubble kicked off by COVID two years ago has yet to truly pop.  The rate hikes of 2022 have yet to be fully realized in valuations of equities.  And there are more hikes coming throughout this year.   Inflation has not been tamed sufficiently, and unemployment is still at record lows.  It’s going to almost certainly serve your financial interest best to be patient and DCA (dollar cost average) into any equity position you are interested in.  This is especially true  if you are of a buy and hold mentality and not “trading” these stocks.  Set buy in levels and percentages and wait.  It’s not very fun or exciting, but perfectly timing a bottom for 100% of your position is not going to be possible.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 15:14:01'] Bro I think you’re just a bit upset and feeling like you’ve made bad decisions, maybe you have.Just take a step backFor now, maybe just add to the vti or whatever you prefer.But saying you’re gonna sell everything you have all these stock positions in really good companies, at this point, feels emotional. I wouldn’t sell all your company tickers referenced.  Just chill and accept that you’re down and will be for awhile. The whole market is down
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:44:07'] Down $370,000 with index funds. Maybe some day they will come back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:29:20'] VOO / VTI majority of their holdings are APPL, MSFT,Goog , Amzn etc no point selling these blue chip behemoths and then average down into ETFs with similar composition
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:52:30'] I think investment decisions should be made based on factors like the bussines performance, or your risk tolerance, but not on price movement.Stocks go up. Stocks go down. If you buy up and sell down you are donating to the market gods.Good luck & do your own due diligence.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 17:53:04'] I have learned a few good rules over the years. Never more than 4% in any individual company. You should look at your sector concentration, you are very heavy in tech. Fidelity has a pdf on what sectors do well in each part of the business cycle. If you are not going to identify what part of the cycle we are in and trade to the appropriate sector then you should just do a total market index.  You might sell the smh and aapl before incurring large losses in those. For the other stocks that have large losses I can’t recommend selling low, but we are not at the bottom. You should look into risk management. We are over a year into a bear market on tech, why are you thinking it is time to sell now?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 00:03:22'] Apple, Microsoft, google, Amazon, SMH are perfectly fine to hold. You'll easily make that back again eventually. Those are higher beta than SP500 so if you sold them at a loss to get VOO, you're arguably gonna take longer to recoup your losses. People are gonna tell you overvalued this and that, just ignore them. Even if they are overvalued now, they're gonna correct, and then grow into their new valuation. Selling them only makes sense if you're gonna buy them again at a supposedly lower valuation.The rest I don't know enough to give you advice on, and I expect the same for most people here, so be careful when you listen to stranger's advices on a big chunk of money. Everyone's here trying to make money for themselves, not others.if you're trying to buy a condo next year, it'd be a good idea to put those savings into bonds right now. Don't DCA into stocks. your time horizon is too short.With that said, if you absolutely need piece of mind and feel you can achieve that by selling them all and putting into SP500, either find an advisor who can change that mindset, or I guess do it if that's absolute. Your mental health's more important. Stocks are supposed to improve your life, not stress you out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:50:28'] First, Buy 1 year T-Bills at 4.5% unless your savings account gives you that.Second, Why sell? You make enough money (probably), so just start a position at VTI or VOO.If you need capital, you can start by selling your highest cost shares, use the tax benefit, reduce your income for the year, and just hold these stocks until the market recovers.If there is a security you are hazy about, then exit it, but otherwise, there is absolutely no reason to exit all these positions at that low price.I am also assuming you know why you bought these stocks,
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:25:57'] Hard to go wrong with VOO/VTIAt the same time, looking at your current holdings, if they continue to go down, you can probably expect VOO and VTI to follow suit, right?  If you're just looking for safety, maybe put the money into something less risky than stocks until the market recovers. Hell, even savings accounts are giving you 4% these days (at least in the US)(Ps. I'm an idiot)
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 19:34:23'] etf will reduce ur risk. What you have left is not a bad portfolio though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 05:34:30'] Thanks for the comments. A couple of points.I am using some special investment account in Sweden with fixed tax, loss or gain (so no tax loss harvesting option for me).I don't have access to the fixed term 4% bonds that some of you mentioned. I have some savings account option, but that's like 1.8% right now.Also, there is currency aspect. The Sek has fallen a lot in the past year to the dolla. USD is still up around 16% in 1 year against SEK (despite an 8% loss the last few months). So if the dollar weakens, my losses may deepen. Also the trend seems to be when us stocks go up, dollar weakens, and similar trend the other way around (so actually this currency aspect has lessened my losses to some extent so far..)I buy the ETFs in euros and euros vs sek fluctuates less than usd vs sekAnd I have 47k of margin at the moment ( still 27k of margin buffer). So maybe first step is sell 47k worth to get rid of the margin? If so, which do you think will be the good candidates to trim from?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:19:44'] So, if you buy that condo, and exactly the day after purchase, its down in value like 30%, will you immediately sell it again?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 15:26:57'] You should keep in mind that a lot of people are doing exactly this right now; it’s becoming an even more very crowded trade. Seeing even more people liquidate into index funds makes me think the indexes will fall harder soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 16:40:58'] I sold everything in december 2021 and it was the best decision of my life. No clue if a bounce is coming in 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 15:53:42'] Aways a good strategy to be in total market.That said, it looks like you intentionally chose tech and specifically those stocks. Why? Other than negative, what has changed about your assessment of the companies. While I understand tech better than most sectors, I am not in love with tech. I am actually starting to buy more tech, some of which moved out of VTI. I bought amazon yesterday and averaged down on another tech. Might it go down more? Sure. Buying low seems like a reasonable strategy too. If I fuck up, that is on me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 17:02:44'] You might want to look for alternative investing and diversification into other assets. For the first time in 20 years or so I will not park another dollar in the market of new money until things turn around. Nowhere in stocks is safe right now. People are losing 10-20-50% of their retirement and investments. We need change and we don’t have it yet. Find other assets to park money in. Stocks isn’t it right now. Cash or alternative assets

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 06:26:37'] The vast allocation of your portfolio are in tech stocks that will rebound in time (hint, I hold the same positions). They are solid companies. Do not sell. Do not look at your portfolio if you truly do not need the money. Why would you sell at such extreme losses?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:29:38'] I'm in a similar boat, though down less and I do need ~100k relatively soon (spread out over a couple months for construction). I got out of all positions that were up or break even. I sold TSLA at a loss (avg. 180, bought at 246). Rest is still in it. My AAPL is at break even now and I have no idea what to do with it, but I think I'll leave it in as I intend to hold it forever.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:27:31'] I kinda follow the old thinking of when a recession hits, I switch to defensive stocks. I trade a lot of my stock almost a year back for consumer staples, utilities, stores, farming, Healthcare. Was in the red before switching, was -10%, now around 6.75%.  Those etfs are mostly made up of tech companies. Me, I am not going to put any money in tech. Maybe Intel since they got those new factories being built, government is backing them and politicians been loading up on them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 16:25:19'] Vti going back to ATH would be a 30% upside. Vug would be a 50% upside. So ya you can make good money going into some somewhat safe ETFs.Although vug has 10 stocks encompassing half the fund.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 09:37:16'] Your current stock holdings are good companies imo, with the most risky one being SE. I would take a step back, and ask yourself, do you see companies like $GOOG or $MSFT or $AAPL being worth much less in 5 years than they are now? Not the stock price, but the business itself. If the answer is no, then keep those positions, especially if you don't need the cash at all. Any new funds you want to invest, I would direct it all to VOO/VTI, to do a couple things:1) Give you that peace of mind and comfort at night2) Eventually those two positions will be the largest in your portfolio, and the existing stock positions won't bother you as muchBiggest thing is to keeping going, learn about your investing temperament, and take that forward with you. Onwards!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 18:18:00'] At the very least I'd sell PYPL and SE and wait 30 days to harvest the loss.You could also harvest GOOG and AMZN loss pretty closely by buying QQQ for 30 days.

Apart from meta and Microsoft. Then lost 15% still $5k up (I’m on for the long haul)Bought $20k BABA two weeks ago.which has propped up my portfolio the last week or so. This shit is crazy. I want to sell shit and go all in now on China and TSLA. Having $150k in these lot right now makes me think that I will leave them alone and wake up in 10 years to see what it’s worth.My best guess is at least $450k but that is VERY conservative. Tesla is an insane value pick that I can see right now.Any thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 18:36:03'] IMHOKeeping in mind my advice is based on experience, but worth what you pay for it.  If you are under about 50 years old, keep the stocks and begin to DCA into VTI or something like it.I firmly believe in America, the economy , and the stock market.  I feel the stocks you listed , especially AAPL, MSFT,  GOOG, and AMZN will come back and do you right. Not sure about PYPL or SE.Keep in the market and remember that old saying,  "time in the market beats timing the market".Also you didn't day off is a taxable or non- taxable account. If you have income or gains to offset against those losses think about harvesting some losses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 23:56:05'] Careful friend.Imo - you want to use this loss to the max potential and think about the tax implications. By selling and buying voo you are still buying apple and msft.My suggestion would be to hold some of your stock. From now on dca into voo. But, sell stock strategically. You've lost so much that to dump all of it in one tax year is foolish. You could literally save yourself many thousands of dollars by selectively selling with your taxes in mind

Expectations already decimated.- GOOG will miss and probably be flat. Some positive news on share buybacks.- AAPL: No clue. I think to the downside.- XOM: Will rise 3-4% on massive share buybacks/dividend announcement (Chevron didn't get that much heat for theirs). - SBUX: Will not only beat earnings, will give insanely good guidance thanks to China.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello all, perhaps a dumb question but one that Ive been thinking on. Lets say you buy into a company, lets use AMZN as an example. You intend to hold this company until retirement, if thats the case why do people care when the company rallies 8% in a day or something similar in the short term. Do they hope that there wont be a pull back? They wouldnt (in most cases) be able to sell and buy back at a lower price if theyve been holding for a while, so I dont really get it. \n\nThanks!'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 19:36:15'] People buy and hold all the time through mutual funds in 401ks. Rally's don't really matter except for people who are sitting there with their finger on the trigger. They're the ones who will worry about the losses. Most people in the 401K business of investing just sit there and say it'll come back in 20 years.People weathered Covid and the housing collapse. Those who held were rewarded.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 19:17:11'] So not everyone buys and holds. I bought Amzn this morning and sold at 122. Was a great day. For people that do buy and hold the rallies don’t matter other than the fact it lets you know the market likes the company and it’s direction. Why would you hold for life in a failing company? Not implying anything about Amzn.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 20:00:09'] If a company drops 8%, then there's a reason for that, usually significant worse future outlook.That 8% drop represents a market comsensus that the company is valued 8% less than yesterday. There is no automatic mechanism that this will be evened out tomorrow, so you might end up with 8% less in your retirement. If you are Warren Buffet and invest only inside your circle of competence, then you are smarter than the market and you can ignore any 8% drop. Most of us, however, are neither Warren Buffet nor smarter than the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 19:35:15'] Amazon is back down lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 23:28:53'] No investment should be designated as *unconditionally* long term.Large, quick moves in either direction frequently serve as indicators to evaluate company health and check against your thesis. Picked stock positions should be frequently evaluated to make sure that the company still justifies its position in your portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-25 13:46:50'] Hopefully the market doesn't overreact too much, I still feel like this was a decent report.  Earnings are fantastic, margins improving drastically, amazon business expanding quickly, and ad revenue doubled.  And they are still forecasting $10 billion more in revenue. While guidance is lower than exoected I think they are providing very conservative revenue guidance to set themselves up for a big beat next quarter. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-25 13:20:52'] What causes a stock to drop $100 in a minute or two? I keep seeing ‘algorithms’ but that doesn’t exactly explain it in layman terms. Can someone explain why sometimes we see $100 drops and $50-100 rises?

Just those two giants missing their earnings after Caterpillar missed this week will cause a severe drop tomorrow, especially for FAANG stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-25 21:47:57'] I think AMZN is honestly over-valued. Unless they make a very good strategic acquisition or diversify into something other than tech, the company will be peaked at where it currently is.
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-25 12:43:49'] One company's quarterly earnings announcement is going to have very little effect on the whole market... I guess if your definition of "make or break" means maybe a 0.5% shift then you might have a chance.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-20 09:27:56'] You describe Amazon just as an online store. Amazon is the market leader on cloud computing with aws. They have plays on video, music streaming, ai assistance, publishing, kindles, tablets with an entire ecosystem around them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-20 07:57:13'] Coca-Cola bought Columbia Pictures in 1982 and ended up selling it to Sony 7 years later. Amazon is certainly capable of hitting a similar wall with one of their growth ideas, Whole Foods or their healthcare business for example.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-19 22:20:11'] There are only three companies I feel comfortable buying and not having to look at and know they’ll do well in a decade- Amazon, Berkshire, and Brookfield Asset Management. 2050 is too far off to make a prediction, in 2000 you probably would have been into GE and 2010 into Exxon Mobile; neither of which have performed well. You’re better off with VT or VTI for that time frame.Amazon will likely get broken up in some shape or form this decade but still has great long term potential and a very enduring culture. It’s a pain in the ass to value and I usually just look at P/FCF as a guiding ratio and see how it compares to historicals, right now it seems fair.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-20 19:35:09'] I have positions in both companies.  (Shares & calls in AMZN, calls in KO).   Amazon is definitely going to grow into its PE multiple.  It has never been managed to make profits, but to allocate capital for future growth.  Now that they own whatever business lines they choose to play in, the profits are coming, and will come for the near future at an increasing rate.  As such, it's as good as any to assume it will be a blue chip like KO was well into the future.KO, however, is still well below its pre-crash high.  They have higher margin in fountain sales than they do in bottled/canned products, which they've been selling in record numbers since the pandemic began.  It hasn't been enough to offset fountain sales, however, and KO has held back future guidance because no one knew when we're going to re-open.Spoiler alert:  The adult US population is already almost half vaccinated and if you look at places like Vegas and Miami this weekend, we're reopening rapidly, even if some government agencies are slow to call it.  Live events, even in NY and CA, are being scheduled.  KO is going to run back to $60 sooner rather than later.  It's long term growth days may be behind it, but don't count it out for a near-term play.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-19 22:27:06'] It’s at $1.5 trillion market cap. It would come down quite a bit or trade flat for decades before it becomes like KO as a value stock.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 23:56:52'] This is a nothing burger. I don't think people realize the stickiness of telehealth services and HIPAA compliance issues. Not to mention how long it takes to integrate partnerships with major health insurance providers. TDOC is international at this point. Amazon is known for throwing things at the wall to see if it sticks. It's a strategy that's worked for them, however they've had their share of failures along the way (fire phone). Telehealth is vastly different than any other service they've provided in the past. If anything I think it's going to be a superficial/add on service that's paired with refills and little else. I've been investing in TDOC before the pandemic and the Livongo merger was a huge catalyst for adding to my position. Didn't even know ARK was buying TDOC if I'm being completely honest. They're currently caught on the wrong side of the rotation out of stay at home stocks. Fact is they've been growing prior to covid and will continue to grow even faster now. When you couple convenience and savings you get a high net promoter score and a value proposition most patients will come back for again and again. My wife is a telehealth nurse practitioner (not TDOC) so I've had my share of insight into the importance of data, integration of systems, partnerships, necessary growing pains, compliance and regulatory hurdles etc.  It's not as easy as solving logistics problems and while Amazon has the capital, I personally think this will be a few years in the making and slower than they anticipate. Important to note TDOC tapped less than 1% of the TAM thus far. The fact that Amazon is trying to capture a significant portion of TAM tells you it's a huge opportunity for many players. End of the day this is an acknowledgement and a nod to the viability of telehealth. TDOC is on a fire sale and I'm maxed out for what I've allocated of my portfolio. Watch what happens over the coming few years, you'll be kicking yourself for not having a piece. Obviously don't invest if you don't have conviction but I highly encourage anyone interested to jump down the rabbit hole.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 20:08:55'] I know Amazon is on a lot of peoples shit list regarding their handling of workers attempting to unionize but damnit If they don’t continue to deliver reasons to invest; what an absolute powerhouse of a company.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 14:41:58'] The stock's taking a breather now, but I'm more excited about Amzn's future than any other company (cough \*electric car/HVAC future leader/insurance future God/meme king\* cough). Health insurance, prescription medicines, robotics in warehouses, delivery by autonomous vehicles, cashless checkout stores, Amazon Air logistics, grocery delivery are a few potential future profit centers in the retail division that they are aggressively investing in - these haven't shown much profit so far, but they have the potential to add billions to the balance sheet. Retail is constantly growing, they added 350k employees over the last 4 months. Amzn don't do small projects, and they sure aren't afraid to invest heavily in ensuring they dominate the business. Don't even get me started about AWS, which will continue to be the backbone of the internet for the near future. Yes Azure is catching up, but there's enough money in the market to feed both whales. The difference between Amzn and Tsla is that Jeff doesn't care much about the stock price. He could inflate it to Venus if he truly wanted - but his leadership team and him much prefer to do the hard work behind the scenes. The biggest risk to Amazon isn't the business, but the regulators. If they can manage to keep the govts off their backs, they'll be 2-3 times bigger in a few years and nobody will even bat an eyelid. I like to think of them as a giant flywheel - you simply cannot stop this juggernaut. Disclosure: Long on Amazon. Will never sell this stock.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 18:00:05'] Amazon is still in hyper growth mode. I’m long and adding. They spun profits from the web site into AWS, Alexa devices, and many other very successful things. They are building the best logistics firm on the planet right now. They’ll probably be doing self driving and all sorts of crazy things down the line. Amazon doesn’t pay dividends and they don’t do buybacks. They take their massive cash flow and invest it back into themselves. And so far they have done a very good job of it. I’m banking on them continuing to get it right.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 08:43:48'] It depends on your goals. Amazon doesn’t likely have as much potential as other smaller cap companies and much of its future success is priced in. It’s not a 10x opportunity anymore, and likely not even a 5x, at least not for a very long time. It depends on your timeframe and investment goals.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 21:49:19'] I bough in Sept. Yea, should of bought in April or something. Honestly don’t care much about the share price. I’m keeping it for many years. I think they have growth left. I’m just happy to own it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 06:01:35'] They have insane levels of growth left to come. The cloud computing market is only a fraction of the total computing market to date, they are the leaders and will continue to be. They are entering and will likely succeed in one or more high-cap markets including grocery, healthcare/rx, insurance, autonomous vehicles, shipping, satellite ISP, commercial rockets. They're a behemoth and their success continues to diversify protecting them from any single industry downturn. Apple is cash rich and can withstand a few blunders but they're just a hardware and services company. Tesla, cars. etc. Amazon is the everything company.

I invested at 550 then sold at 1200 re bought (smaller) 1400, sold at 1800 and re bought (again smaller) at 1850. I am simply betting and I know it. Lets face it if a bear market start this and the whole FAANG group will be the first to get slashed, other than Apple which seems to be at a reasonable PE. Its crazy that the market does this very few years. I really want to take advantage but I know the bottom will fall out. Think of this like a loan, you are loaning Amazon money to build their business that they currently say " if we keep going like we are we should have it back to you in say 150-200 years", no one would make that loan. I say keep investing but be aware that all you are doing now is trying to time the market cause sooner or later this will fall so don't put in more than you can lose.

But Cook completely missed that demand had shifted to larger phones,  iPhone 5 and 5s were the candy bar phones a little longer than Job’s creation but no wider.  If he had kept the 4 size foe people like me who don’t want bigger and built a phone to compete with the note, the 50 percent crash of 2013 goes the other way.  Amzn is loved by all the new Yorkers who are to busy to buy toothpaste at a Store.

	COMMENT: ['2018-09-28 19:24:47'] Dude check out what Amazon is doing in India, which is foretasted to be the largest Ecommerce market in a decade.  They've already built \~60 FCs and are beating Flipkart and Snapdeal on App downloads and daily visits in India.Go to Google trends and chart out Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal over 10 years.  Amazon first surpassed Snapdeal and then Flipkart last year, and is trending at a higher slope.  Another note: Flipkart+Walmart deal was not received well by Indians, with large groups boycotting the US Juggarnaut's involvement.  India is HUGE opportunity for Amazon and they are positioning themselves for success.

At what point do we use the T word again, I mean what do you call a massive price spike that lasted about a year but transitory. Of course it might go back up again, but if it doesn't would help to bring down inflation as utility prices directly affect what landlords charge for rents.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 14:39:55'] The next GDP report for Q4 2022 is going to blow the first half of 2022 out of the water. [Recent Atlanta Fed forecasts](https://i.imgur.com/a6Ex560.png) now up to 3.8% (*real* quarter over quarter GDP growth for Q4). The actual estimate is on January 26. 2022 will probably end up something like: -1.6%, -0.6%, 3.2%, 3.8%, which comes out to annual growth of 1.2%.For 2023, [here are the expected growth rates](https://i.imgur.com/wJyYQ5f.png) for G20 countries. The US is expected to grow 1.2% in 2023. Note that the European countries will mostly have higher growth rates since they are coming out of a much worse macro situation in 2022. The exception being the UK (what are you doing over there! I made a detailed [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10308yd/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_jan_04_2023/j2zg7ko/) yesterday all about the UK if you want to see [12 devastating graphs](https://imgur.com/a/0KiUXQC)).[Here is the USD index](https://i.imgur.com/Gb48zpT.png) if someone wishes to relate the numbers to recent trends. Since October 2022 the USD has been steady weakening, and about half of the gains through 2022 were wiped out. Since the October bottom, VXUS is up 14% while VTI is up 5%, no doubt in part due to this weakening. (Note that VXUS is yielding 3%, double that of VTI which is around 1.5%, so add in a fraction of that to each, respectively, for the total return, to get 14.75% for VXUS and VTI 5.3%).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 05:49:47'] Can a recession not happening be good for the economy but still bad for stocks?Say employment remains high and economic growth remains positive. If this happens and inflation still comes down, what incentive will the fed have to actually lower rates once inflation gets under control?The whole narrative of the market is the fed will raise rates, which will defeat inflation but also lead to a recession and unemployment. Bc of the recession the fed will eventually lower rates to stimulate the economy. The S&P cares about low rates a lot bc of the cost of capital and the risk free rate. So theoretically is there a situation where we get no recession, inflation comes down but the market is still not recovering bc of the high interest rates. If rates remain high for a long time there's also way less incentive to invest in risky assets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 06:52:21'] I think the market is taking today’s labor data as again meaning that the Fed is gonna continue hiking rates up, up and up in their continued effort to fight *supposed* wage inflation. Leaving aside whether wage inflation is a good thing (I’d think that it’s been long overdue for decades for workers to have the upper hand in wage negotiations, but others may take the opposite view), everything happening the past couple months does suggest that the Fed has already gone, or will go, too far.  Past five months annualized CPI is 2%, the latest PMI was dismal, and there’s lots of news coming out these weeks about banks laying off a couple 10k workers, Amazon laying off a couple 10k, Salesforce laying off a couple 10k, etc etc. Europe’s MOM CPI this week already was at a shocking -1%.Employment levels are still strong now, but I think this is gonna end with a dam breaking and a TON of small businesses and the real economy cracking. And then the widespread layoffs beyond just the banks and tech companies will start. And the Fed will once again be all surprised Pikachu, who could’ve predicted this would happen?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 08:41:51'] The fed is so keen on killing the job market, even as the CPI plummets - Did they even think of the reasons why it's so hot?

(and either wait them out or anticipate towards them or someth).
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 13:07:26'] I don't think this will happen, however the absolute worse outcome for the stock market is that we never enter a recession.  That would give the Fed no reason to pivot and lower interest rates in 2023.Again, I think that outcome is unlikely due to all the companies announcing layoffs.  However I do like to consider the potential possibility of all potential outcomes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 05:43:27'] Continues to disgust me how much the powers that be - the Fed, institutions, fund - WANT a recession and WANT unemployment to go up. Month after month after month for the past year we have good employment data, and every single time institutions have throwed a tantrum and sent everything crashing down. Is this not literally wanting America to fail, wanting Americans to lose their jobs and go on the bread line? Sickens meIt’s not even about inflation anymore, isn’t the best case soft landing scenario supposed to be that inflation comes down but employment remains strong and the economy doesn’t tank? Isn’t that what we’ve been having the past months? Yet institutions and the Fed continue reacting negatively to this data every time it comes out. It seems what they really want is for wages of American laborers to go DOWN

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 06:25:17'] The market is not going to respond well to any news, good or bad.  It's just going to keep chopping sideways.Propaganda or not, the government has to spool up its media machine to start downplaying COVID.  Maybe start producing studies that show it isn't that bad.  The continual indiscriminate spending on services is preventing a "soft landing" because the hiring can't keep up with demand and there isn't any attempt at immigration reform and birth rates are bad.People have succumbed entirely to living their best life which puts upward pressure on jobs and the sectors hiring are mostly services.  I don't see this getting fixed without a massive deflationary bust and that won't happen because it's a self-feeding spiral at this point.Even if the Fed accepts a 4% inflation rate as reality, they can't print people so what are good long automation plays?Any thoughts?

Guidance was weaker but still signified significant growth. You have to remember the law of large numbers. 10-20% growth guidance is still huge when we are talking about 60bil quarters. Lastly, AWS and advertising results, where the real profitability and money is, were amazing. Amazon is cheap at 1500. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 13:49:21'] If anything, Amazon seems to have closed into a lower P/E ratio at the price point and that's a great thing imo. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 13:13:04'] Only? 4.9% is a good return on an investment. Spoiled much??
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 12:32:56'] Meanwhile SPY is down a tad over the last 6 months. Everything is relative. You don't have to be up crazy percentages to be doing well. Match or beat the market and have a long-term view and you will do just fine. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 17:34:56'] I’m pretty sure Bezos doesn’t care about stock price at all. Looking long term is the important thing and corrections, recessions, and bear markets are all apart of it.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 18:11:13'] Still seems like this is based on nothing. Is this just panic selling? GDP is good, jobs are good, earnings growth is good....
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 19:18:51'] I’m fairly new to investing, so this might be a dumb question, but-Amazon tanked after it missed its revenue targets, but wasn’t revenue still up, it just missed the target? This company has done nothing but grow, and continues to grow and for the very first time it started to grow just a little bit slower. Why is there such a panic at constant, albeit slower, growth?
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-29 12:46:29'] What new information has come out that leads the market to believe that AMZN is worth less than 80% what the market thought it was worth a month ago?

Long term I think Brookfield property have a better plan by reorganizing premium location into living and office space.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 12:40:35'] As a long-term buy-and-holder Amazon investing $4B in long-term strategies instead of short-term profits struck me as really good news. However you feel about the company ethically, all these strikes are probably going to lead to an increase in automation, setting Amazon up for even more of a long-term competitive advantage over everyone in the industry than they already have.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 13:18:10'] I’ve said this before, long term bull short term not so much. I said that before earnings as it was on a ridiculous run. The reinvest of profit did not go over well plus the new obstacles. I would consider getting back in under $2k.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 14:25:07'] I think main is going to crash after COVID finally subsides.Amazon will consume a lot of that market.More and more companies are going to move to cloud, Amazon has IMO the best cloud platform.There are only two other cloud competitors (there are more but the market is AWS, Azure or GCP if you’re enterprise) so a decent moat.I trust in Bezos vision. I don’t think I like him but he’s done some pretty amazing things to date.I hold only 2 shares @ $1752 cost basis and will buy more soon especially if they dip any further.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 14:37:08'] HOLD. Amazon is fine. The earnings is just a reflection of high demand of cheap and uncommon purchases. They’re shipping 10x the amount of products they’re normally selling. Causing a high price in shipping. They’ll fix it. The other news you don’t need to worry.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 14:08:12'] Amazon just reinvested their earnings back into their business in a time where it here’s a scaling down. They gained market share and are spending money to keep it. Couple this with the expanding it has been already doing makes them a very strong long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 14:21:46'] If you’re thinking of selling a week after you bought then you’re not a long term holder....You need to focus more on conviction and not buying something until you’re convinced. Are you buying the company because u believe in it long term? Or are you buying because of share prices in the short term?Pro tip: buy good companies and quit looking at your investments every day.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 16:27:28'] Neither. Just not attracted to it at these prices when I can buy banks at half their value paying me 4% dividends.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-02 19:08:18'] I am in a similar boat. 10 shares @ $2406.I bought it for that price prior to the earnings betting that they would be stellar and that I could make some cash in the short-term. That didn't work out obviously and now I am oscillating between selling / buying. My biggest mistake was that I did not set a stop-loss prior to purchasing since I was taking a short-term position on them. I can guarantee you that a lot of new investors did something similar and are now panic selling because they were chasing short-term gains.One thing is undeniable. Amazon is one of the most solid companies in the midst of this pandemic as peoples movement is restricted. They will most likely emerge from this crisis stronger than before. The price might dip in the short term but it's Amazon. We aren't talking about airline, cruise ship or casino stocks, the risk here is minimal.  Also, as a certified AWS cloud practitioner I can attest that their cloud services are top of the line.If you are a long-term investor then there is no debate here. HOLD. If you have a short position then that is a different story.[https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=amzn](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=amzn)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 02:03:47'] The obvious pick for me is TSLA, but I wouldn't consider that a sneaky pick, so I'd say COIN. They have a ton of cash, they're the most transparent and trusted brokerage out there which is a huge deal right now, they might inherit a huge part of Binance's market share if they indeed go bust like FTX, and their leadership is top of the bill. The only real risk for Coinbase at this valuation is that crypto might not become mainstream, but I think that risk is small over the long term.As for Stellantis, I don't see how they're not going bankrupt tbh. Maybe not over the next 5 years, but their leadership is terrible and they're gonna have a hard time transitioning to EVs.

I chose 6 stocks (one of which was amazon, 4 of which were tech) and it has performed extremely well since, far outperforming the s&p500, the tech sector, and fang. I think AMZN is a great choice, but I would spread it around a little bit. I like FB too, and MSFT. As far as non-tech stocks go, Mastercard, Visa, and Amex are solid choices IMO. I have been holding VISA which has performed amazingly.Anyway bottom line is that I would choose maybe 3-6 different stocks in different sectors. That being said, it's not a bad idea to weigh a little heavier in tech than others. Make sure you thoroughly research the companies first though. I would look more at the long term prospects of the company rather than their value today. Pick companies that are doing great things long term and have excellent management teams. Presumably you won't be selling these stocks for years, with the exception of maybe occasionally switching around your positions.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-27 08:33:53'] I’m gonna disagree with most people on this thread and say just put it all in Amazon. Buy hard shares and buy them before the feb. 1 earnings announcement. Here’s three reasons why:1. The race to 1T market cap. With Apple google and AMZN racing to the proverbial finish line there’s still huge room for Amazon to go even as it competes with the two other tech giants. 2. AMZN is a rapidly diversifying business. E commerce  and cloud computing have been the main drivers of the price historically but with the growth and expansion into online streaming, advertising and Christ grocery stores of the future you’re betting on amazons ability to continue innovating and diversifying. It’s a good bet. 3. Timing. Sure amazon continues to hit records highs and some fear a pullback. But they are about to report on a quarter following holiday shopping and brand new business plan for Amazon GO. Not to mention speculation for growing Advertising numbers to chip away at goog and FB market share on a multi billion dollar industry. Is it smart to put all your eggs in one basket? Typically no, but with Amazon even if there is a pullback coming the long term growth and value are sure to far surpass the short term. Get your portfolio centered on  something you believe in and take the slight risk.

People cheer for him, volunteer to have his babies, and pump stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 21:13:51'] META is much more than the Facebook website.They own Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Instagram is basically a verb at this point and WhatsApp is used by two billion MAU. Oculus/VR will help them with their metaverse rollout, if it ever comes to that.With the exception of Instagram, they really haven't even begun to monetize the other two yet.I do think Zuck is extremely polarizing and it would help greatly if he resigned or stepped into a less prominent role in the company.I think they were overvalued during the COVID top but at less than $140 a share, I think the market has discounted most of the risk away

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 20:28:38'] OP should credit the original author and source of the Wall Of Text at the top, lest people mistake it for original content.   People hate Facebook, and have hated it for a long time. The key to Facebook's stickyness has been it's monopolization of these hive/network effects. Facebook was the only place that people could reach out to funny person X from high school, or see Grandma's photos, etc. Users grew resentful due to a lack of other social networking options that spared them the constant bickering and poisonous news feed algorithm. Once the exodus started, the entire collective finally felt empowered to join in. It's irreversible, Facebook is over, thank fuck. When you buy a company, you're making a decision to \*not\* buy all the other companies. There are hundreds of other companies I would buy before this one, it's a no-brainer.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 06:22:40'] I just don’t like watching little short videos. I’ve been using Instagram so much less since Reels took over my feed. Also, I don’t want to see strangers shit on my page. When I get on social media, I want to interact with people I know or like. I really don’t want to see someone I don’t know dancing or their kids.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 23:22:54'] This is the exact time to buy a stock.  Terrible macro economic conditions, every single god damn negative catalyst ALREADY priced in.  People say they have to transition from a growth to value stock.  They are already valued like a value stock and are included in certain value etf's purely due to their valuations.  They have a crazy high buffer in terms of financials as well as a sizable moat in terms of ability to withstand bad conditions for a long period of time.  Here are the positives.  Whatsapp has not been monetized properly yet.Instagram CAN pivot.  I do not think Facebook can pivot but it will still generate massive amounts of cash flow.  Everyone I know on Facebook does it for keeping in touch as well as hobby/community things.  For example, if you're a car guy 90% of the local and regional car community is through fb/ig.  Headwinds for TikTok/Bytedance.  If the Republicans take control of the chambers as well as the executive branch in 2024, do you really fucking think they won't try their best to ban Tik Tok?  Those boomers HATE all of us younger generations millenials and below and absolutely despise China.  China already banned American social media platforms over there.  The fact that Trump couldn't get it done is a shock in itself.  Instagram and Facebook will clearly benefit MASSIVELY if this were to happen.  And the chances are very high.  I wouldn't bet the house on Meta.  But to assume it's dead at this point is ridiculous.  Everyone said the same thing when they went ipo and generated zero income.  They said the same thing when they switched from PC to Mobile.  The Zuck is a fucking weird piece of shit but he has proven he knows how to pivot and generate profits.  I would absolutely not count them out yet.  It's not the worst idea to invest a small portion of your investments into Meta because the downside is all but priced in.  The upside is absolutely wild.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 06:03:38'] So, log into Facebook and you sift through 90% advertisements - now designed to look like regular posts, to see one two posts from friends and family - arbitrarily decided by Facebook - because it won’t let you see half the stuff your friends are posting. Next - they try to force the tik tok reels down your throat and won’t allow you to disable them. I hold on to Facebook solely to communicate with friends and family. That’s it. Facebook seems hell bent on eliminating the one and only feature I use it for.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 10:13:31'] It is so cool to hate on Meta these days because they collect your useless data. Newsflash, all tech companies collect your data, your apple phone has your voice, finger print, facial scan.Everyone thinks Meta is spending billions of dollars on building is just Horizon World. That is pretty stupid to think that. The technology they are building which will be combine with the AR headsets they are building could very well be the future of the internet. I for one think it looks pretty cool. All the haters say that Meta doesn’t innovate but then out the other side of their mouth they say the Metaverse is stupid. Do you honestly think the first iteration is what they have spent billions on? Was the first iteration of a cell phone that great?Meta is a money printing machine and is extremely undervalued. If you are an investor, you need to stop complaining about how they banned Trump or censored something. Meta gets it from both sides, no one is going to be happy. People complain that Meta should have censored something and people complain when they do. It is literally just a website that collects data to help businesses sell more. One day hating on Meta will be old news and the only thing that will matter will be the billions of dollars it makes each quarter.

I also wonder if they’ll get a boost next year or so if companies over stocked on inventory due to supply chain shortage fears and will have to spend more on advertising to get rid of these products. As for the metaverse, i think it’s clear there’s interest among the younger populations in AR/VR. This seems to be the “next” thing whether people want to believe it or not.

It is hard to move forward when you put yourself in a meta verse corner when everything is falling without any sort of positive signs. I just don't get the management. There are 2 possibilities, either the meta-verse becomes their version of an "iPad" or just a waste of +20B. If the first, we are not even close, and if the second, where do you? Every time I open IG, or my once a year check on FB, I have Ads on top of ads on top of ads. You ain't gonna keep pushing more ads and push your users out, as if they are not already leaving the platform.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 01:51:47'] the core business FB has essentially disintegrated and IG is losing some momentum.  WhatsApp honestly is its only product with any user growth but there is plenty of viable competition in the messaging services.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 20:07:32'] Good article that summaries the state of play at Meta. The biggest challenges to stock price are transitioning from a growth stock, into a value stock, which will impact the stock price. Add to that the Metaverse and VR headsets (which i don't see being popular), and how this will split opinion. Challenging times for Meta i think, will possibly look for a long term short and hold if we see a rally in October
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 07:03:20'] "Facebook’s business was built on network effects — users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies."  Ah.  You mean a type of Ponzi scheme.  Those never end badly do they?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 06:02:17'] Stopped using FB as part of my daily routine--or to post life events--after being constantly assailed by political ads and political posts all during 2016. I never mixed politics and family before, and forcing the two.became untenable.Now, I barely use it... maybe once a month, or even othe rmonth, to reach the more tech-challanged of my older family members. Somehow they managed to learn to use FB and that what's they're sticking with. My young adults and teenager wouldn't dream of using FB. Instead I use Marco Polo for short video messages (that many of my family prefer to texting) and Imstagram for sharing a family photo to a select group.  What we're doing instead is having Zoom meetings as a family evey week or two weeks, as schedules allow. I do the same with my friends. These last about an hour or so and were able to echalnvhge news, plans, requests and just rant qothoit typing or adding photos... all without ads. I use a paid Zoom subscription and host these family virtula get-togethers. I use Duo to reach my two grown kids in the military by vidoe chat (which they prefer), or Discord to play video games with them whennthey have time. We did my oldest daughter baby shower by Zoom; all the relatives across the country and her various friends were able to join and support her. Using games, music and fake news challenges made it a lot different than a business meeting. I buy jewlery, gifts and accesories on Etsy these days, supporting folks that sell vintage items or what they make independently of FB or Amazon or Ebay. Yes, it's an older site, however, it's much easier than trying to navigate the myriad ads and promoted messages on the FB marketplace. FB had its day in the sun, but the platform has become so riddled with ads and controversy that it is tainted... even when used by folks for good purposes, for legitimate commerce, or just to post about their lives. If the metaverse R&D funds pay out, eventually, folks will herald the Meta shift as 'brilliant' and 'farsighted.'If it doesn't carch on, we'll hear words like 'slow decline' and 'throwing good money after bad.'In my opinion, the metaverse is a yawing money pit... but it is an interesting one. It is one that may actually have potential gold at the bottom.I'd invest in it, perhaps a little later on in the process when more substantial proof of concept emerges.Edit: I have no stocks in any of the companies I mentioned in this post.

I do use Instagram which is enjoyable as a user, but I don’t see how they can make mobey with it because it’s difficult for the users to make money with it. The users can sell their posts to other companies but that bypasses Facebook.

The other company can get away with things that would flirt with Enron.It's not either/or though. You can choose both. It's a foreign stock and you're not buying it directly.

I use my free Twitch prime subscribe to support a Twitch streamer. The streamer that I subscribed to gets $2.50 per month from Amazon.(Confirmed by streamers)So Amazon is actually getting $5.83 from me per month to cover my free shipping, Amazon original TV/Movies, 5% cash back, music and im sure I still missed out more offerings because they give away so much.Last year, I got free $110 from Amazon because of their shipping issues. They delivered their items 1 week late. I complained about it and they said they will refund my item, I get to keep the item and they will extend my prime for 1 month. I'm spoiled by their fantastic customer service but I can't stop thinking how they are making money. The amount they refunded me was more than what I paid for my Prime membershipI understand that AWS is where they really make money but how can it cover everything?

They do not have the infastructure, resources, or know-how to take it over anytime in the near future. Even Walmart has a logistics supply chain that dwarfs Amazon. Not to mention the market Amazon is focusing on brings the smallest amount of profit. For future reference, anytime you think you hear something good about Amazon's delivery services just remember it's UPS and FedEx that actually make those services possible. UPS, FedEx, and USPS are two-day prime delivery, not Amazon.

Right now they have so much data of people houses mapped out in order to communicate with other parts of your household. They recently gave up all that data for AWS to use and for others to make robots using AWS. This will help innovate in a big way. In other words Google, Microsoft, Apple all have nothing on the technolgy behind Alexa and AWS. How will any of these companies get a device into peoples homes to literally scan every inch of your house. As of now they have the floor tracked, pool data, soon window data from a new cleaning device coming out, gutter data, lawn data. Thats where I see big value in both companies.

	COMMENT: ['2018-02-22 10:04:22'] The problem with Amazon is as they get bigger they can keep setting the rules and you have no choice but to abide by them. It's their ecosystem, they can do as they please. This is why I like the idea of a blockchain-based online retail where it can operate more like a cooperative where the rules are set by those who participate/invest and not by one company (or one person: Jeff Bezos).  
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-21 14:53:18'] This is called a conglomerate, and in the past conglomerates have failed to compete with smaller, more efficient, and more specialized companies. Amazon has shown themselves to be different so far, and they have enough money to acquire smaller competitors, but who knows how companies in the future may utilize new technologies to chip away at Amazon's many businesses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 11:15:53'] GOOG - Might not be the best stock for the next couple years, but I strongly believe after this recession we will see a great recovery in the stock. Really bullish on YouTube Shorts and the cloud portion becoming profitable. AMZN - Pretty bullish on AWS, not that knowledgeable on the  cloud, but from what I've heard, AWS is definitely the best out of it's competitors. I think the retail business will become more profitable soon too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 11:35:56'] LEU- they just won a contract to produce high enrichment uranium in America. This is a valuable power source and until now is entirely produced in Russia. So the US government is basically building them a factory to start production. XPOF- they own a number of boutique fitness brands (think club pilates, pure Barre, etc.). They operate a franchise model, so they are asset light. They keep rapidly expanding too, domestically and internationally. CLH- they collect industrial waste. As more factories are onshoring, they stand to gain big. CECO- they make environmental control equipment. They are in the process of making the business a less cyclical, higher recurring revenue company. Interesting play on industrialization.

UUUU - They are upgrading their uranium mill to process REE. They will be the only ones in the US to process mozanite sand, due to being radioactive, which has much better margins.

It is easily disrupted due to storms, wild fires and heat waves which are getting worse.  It is also a target for hackers as hostilities with China, N Korea and Russia escalate.

It is not slowing down as wave 2 keeps shoppers away from stores again. Most people that sign up for Prime are hooked for life and many people succumbed due to having few convenient options to get their goods quickly and safely since lockdowns began in March.Q2 earnings and outlook will be very juicy as AMZN owned Q2 retail and is in position to take advantage of opportunities that arise from of the downfall of B&M retailers, like acquisitions to increase their physical presence and expand their logistical network.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 14:31:46'] My RX7. It’s by far my largest growing asset. I bought it as a teenager in 2009 with $10k my grandfather had left me and now it’s worth $40k. None of my other positions have grown that much since I started really investing in 2018ish. Never thought a car would be my greatest asset.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 13:57:32'] United Health Group (UNH).  It's a superbly ran dividend growth company with a product that everyone needs and will continue to need forever (healthcare). Over the next decade, especially as the boomer population starts to require more medical procedures, UNH will continue to grow. Presently, UNH has grown its revenues from $60 billion per quarter in 2020 to $80 billion per quarter now. It's on track to be doing over $100 billion per quarter in revenue by 2024. To put this into perspective, Apple did $83 billion last quarter, UNH did $80.2 billion. UNH's revenue has never gone backwards and they have beat expectations every quarter since 2008.  UNH has a running CAGR at 23% for the past 30+ years and has outperformed the S&P 28/31 years in total, including this year (UNH +4.35%, SPY -16.6%; UNH is currently outperforming the SPY by 20.95%, YTD).

Storms happen EVERY WINTER, and it's entirely plausible that they happen at the worst possible time...such as a busy flying season like Christmas week, and yet ALL of them just completely dropped the ball and couldn't get their flights going. Something isn't right over there in that industry. Plus, inflation is STILL bad.

POST_TEXT: b'I know this topic has been brought up many times and many times people have mentioned Bezos\' disdain for stock splits.\n\nHowever, I can\'t help think AMZN will announce a stock split in their next earnings report.  With the recent "value" created for shareholders of Apple and Tesla with their stock split announcements, I think it would be a disservice to the shareholders by Bezos and Amazon if there hasn\'t been an internal discussion on a stock split already.\n\nLast stock split was back in 1999.  Stock is currently above $3K, which is almost 30x higher before the stock split in 1999.\n\nBelow is a quote from an article I\'ve read:\n\n*"However, nothing has been done to control the price of Amazons stock since the last split in September 1999. When asked in 2017 whether he would split the stock again, Jeff Bezos  Amazons chief executive officer (CEO)  said that he would not rule it out, but that it was not imminent. As a result, it remains to be seen whether the e-commerce giant will split '

	COMMENT: ['2018-04-26 13:56:30'] This is great news for SHOP who reports on Tuesday.  It's going to be KABOOM time!
	COMMENT: ['2018-04-26 19:33:15'] 53 comments and only 2 are bearish on AMZN. Not saying it's gonna tank tomorrow, but since OP asked, I'm a contrarian on this stock 100%. When there is a big correction, I just see Amazon leading the pack on the way down as is historically the case with companies that lead on the way up. If I could swing it, I'd buy some narrow Jan 2020 vertical put spreads on this to keep a relatively small and defined risk and still take the short position. Unfortunately, even the narrowest spreads on this would basically have me put most of my account into one trade which is a big no-no. As an alternative way to take part in that trade, I opened some debit ATM straddles on XLK in March when I thought IV had calmed down enough. Either I'm right and I'll profit on the downside or I'm really wrong and we haven't even seen the euphoria phase of this bull market yet and I'll take part in the upside. Either way, I just don't see the market staying in this range for the next year and a half.Anyway, before anyone starts bringing up all the great growth opportunities and fundamentals this company has, I'd just like to point out that when there is a *market* correction, people are forced to sell stocks they don't want to sell to free up capital. Couple that with the fact that people (and money managers) don't like to lock in losses by selling something that hasn't performed and I'm just of the opinion that FANGs are up first to be sold precisely **because** of how well they've done. I know I'm always tempted to want to sell my winners and let the losers ride and it's a constant battle between logic and emotion to overcome that. Anyway, I realize this will probably get buried with downvotes but maybe consider that the voting system isn't meant to be for indicating who you agree/disagree with.

	COMMENT: ['2018-04-26 16:09:13'] I’m amazed and very impressed. I knew they would crush earnings but even this showing is impressive.My concerns with Amazon are the same as they were before however: being way too overvalued in an overvalued market, diversifying too quick, poorly, and extreme (ex. GE) and low margins (which is why I think AWS is so important and critical for their long term success). There will be a point where Amazon, like every company, hits some stagnation and has difficulty with innovation. This is why it’s important they continue doing what they have been with courageously yet carefully diversifying with other platforms.It’s so hard getting an honest read with this company. We’re in current period where valuations are ridiculously high. If someone saw the way amazon operates 10-15 years ago they would be shocked and dumbfounded. Yet here they are, still doing their thing and proving the doubters wrong. They’ve done everything right and then some so far though. Great company with a bright future that continues to surpass my expectations and concerns.It will be interesting to see how the increase in prime membership fares. I personally think it won’t hurt things and their membership numbers will actually only continue to grow. The increase may look dramatic at first but I actually think it’s a perfect figure.Think I’ll finally put some money in them once a nice buying opportunity/dip comes by. The last few ones I thought it would go a little lower and missed out. Still think this company has massive potential. Great quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2018-04-26 21:58:06'] There are still many risks and growing competition across all sectors of Amazon's businesses. For example,Retail: If you think retail companies are snails just sitting around doing nothing to combat amazon you would be dead wrong. Walmart's still nascent online business is growing at an astonishing rate. Other retailers like Best Buy are also increasing their online presence & free shipping capabilities. They will improve markedly over the next 5 years and still have valuable brand loyalty.Video: Content is still king and while content has increased on Amazon the highest rated shows drawing all the eyes are still going to Netflix and HBO. In addition, acquisition costs for content, such as the 1 billion price for a few seasons of Lord of The Rings TV show, is skyrocketing meaning lower margins. Due to increasing costs, I see this service as being likely to be split off from the annual prime subscription. AWS: Margins are great here no doubt, and amazon proved here that it is important to be first to market, but competition from Microsoft, google, Oracle, and others is growing fast and amazon risks losing market share should they fail to continue improving and innovating new products.Ads: This segment is already dominated by the duopoly of facebook and google. Advertisers are already spread thin across those platforms where people give most of their eyesight time. While people do indeed spend a lot of time on amazon shopping, increasing ads could detract from the user experience hence there is always a limit here. Where that limit is remains to be seen. Payed promotion of products just like on google will be important here. But convicing advertisers to move from the already proven platforms of facebook and google to amazon will be challenging I think. Other: Lastly risk of regulation, especially considering Trump's animosity towards Bezos and the Washington Post, should make all investors at least cautious of long term growth and monopoly indictments. This risk will be reflected in the stock price.

Amazon has a P/E of 90, it grows revenue at 9% YoY, ROE growth -66%, EBITDA growth -15% and very bad margins. The EBITDA margin is 10% and the Net Income margin is just 2%. With inflation at 7% this company is bleeding money. The e-commerce business can't make money after over 20 years and competition is rising rapidly. And in the cloud business the competition will grow and it's not enough to make Amazon a growth company...but if it's not a growth company anymore how do you justify a P/E of 90?Before investing it's important to make some analysis otherwise it's just a casino bet. Google is a better company but I'm not crazy about ads businesses....I don't even use the Google search engine anymore. Among the Big Cap companies Microsoft and Tesla are without a doubt the best. Microsoft is active in a lot of important division and it's a resilient business....Microsoft Office, Business Intelligence, Cloud, Gaming, Windows, Computers....they are a powerhouse. Tesla is the default company for electric cars and make the best ones. They have a huge backlog and they are doing great in China too and that market is massive......1,5 billion people. Not many big companies have access to that market because of restrictions. And some people don't know it but Tesla is active in the huge (especially in the future) solar business...the potential is massive. But as of now, I'm not invested in any of them. I'm waiting for the recession to enter at a lower price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-17 13:18:53'] Amazon has been losing $22 mill a day this year. The companies are powerhouses till Ken Griffin decided to manipulate the stock. Look at Meta, Baba, Nvidia etc. all got hammered bad. Same will happen to Amazon too. Google might be safe, but tbh, after this year, I am done holding individual names. Only trade individual names. If I hold anything long term it’s only index.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-17 09:33:15'] Wait until either there’s high unemployment, inflation comes down to 2%, or a complete market capitulation. That will mark the bottom. Both are good companies but that doesn’t matter now, sadly. You can do all your buying all at once, once the fed pivots. Personally I’m just holding onto my TSLA shares and saving cash until inflation comes down, unemployment goes way up, or we see a crazy capitulation. Index’s still have further to drop since they aren’t pricing in earnings drop.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 21:10:37'] I'd be surprised if we didn't at least get a slight pull back in the morning after the bell but the market will most likely end the day green. There isn't any other data coming out soon to sway the market until the next month's FOMC meeting and cpi numbers. If the next fed meeting goes well and we only raise rates a half point and then the cpi numbers come out confirming that inflation is in fact starting to fall, than there will be a huge probability that we see an end to this bear market. I'm not convinced yet, as Powell's last meeting didn't show any sign of him budging, mid terms elections are pretty much over with no "red wave", and keep in mind there is a real possibility that the next numbers might actually come in hot. So in other words, we go up or down. But seriously, be patient and keep your eye on the news.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:57:30'] I think the general consensus is that this isn’t going to last, and doesn’t have any legs… which is probably right. There’s a severe resistance level above formed by the upper band of the descending channel on the SPX. Technically, we’re almost certain to be headed for the 100 short term. After that, I know 4100 is on the top end of a lot of analysts range… good resistance at 3900-3915. If we get two closes about that level it’s higher to that 41 handle, but if it’s rejected then we pause until next months data.. possible PCE or FOMC as a catalyst before that. Ultimately though, we should be down to 3200 in a realistic world. Lots of forward expectations have to work out perfectly for these values to be justified historically.Having said all that: tomorrow? Something in me says we should be lower for consolidation. But the indexes hit the highs of the day on the close; there are simply no more sellers and the buyers have taken control. Most people are expecting a consolidation day, and there’s still a lot of pessimism and bearishness… so I’ll say big up day tomorrow. +2.5% $COMP +1.8% $SPX +350 on the Dow.

The way these companies get their tax rates down so low is because they carry forward and write off losses and/or are able to write off business investments like R&D and expansionsI mean if you don't want companies to be able to do these things then say it, at least then people will know how decisions like this affect job growth, prices, and innovation.

Inventors, industrialists, and entrepreneurs got to where they are because they paid the price up front by risking their own livelihood and welfare, innovating, sacrificing their resources up-front, leading others to produce, etc. They gathered others, the people, to become employees, because those employees obviously couldn’t and still can’t do what they did to get to where they are. The workers, the people, the consumers, the ones that the companies employed, got them there, but it was the leaders/owners of those companies that hit the employees there. Corporations begin with one to a few determined people. It will be the people, the employees, the workers, that will keep the companies running by paying taxes for those companies. Yes, those same employees will pay the taxes on behalf of the companies. The money will just be redistributed by politicians, lawmakers, scam artists, liars, thieves, they are. Democrats never get the fact that corporate heads aren’t idiots. That’s right. We all know The Democratic Party is the “tax more, toll more, and take more party.” Businesses will move their companies out of the country, or just sell to foreign investors and cash out. Read Atlas Shrugged. Producers quit when their resources are taken. Champions stop playing the game when you make rules so that “everyone wins.” If they stay in business after being levied a 15% corporate tax, they will increase prices to cover inflation, thus driving inflation higher. A friend of ours showed us a receipt from a restaurant last weekend that had a new charge on it, “Temporary Inflation Fee.” Hmm. Who’s paying that? The restaurant? No the customer is. The rich are rich because they are always smart to figure out how to get out of paying more, whether it be taxes or more for their raw materials, if they are manufacturers. If restaurants pay more for food and fuel, they increase prices. As stupid as Trump was and is, he said something very honest that every successful business tycoon knows, but doesn’t have the balls to say, “Paying less taxes doesn’t make me a bad person. It makes me smart.” Do you want to give more of your money to the US government and let them manage it? Really. How good of a job have they been doing the last 20 years or so? We would be in jail if we stole like they do. The deficit is like an out of control water meter, spinning endlessly. The hydrant is open full blast and it’s flowing dollars with high pressure. WE are the source of those dollars. The American workers. So, WE will pay those corporate taxes. Not the corporations. Votes to raise taxes are votes to speed up the bleeding process toward the death of a democracy. Free childcare, healthcare, education, job training, food, gas, housing, etc, etc. Free? Who’s paying the bill? We are. We’re paying with our freedom to generate more money by giving more tax money to dishonest, disloyal, and disgusting people. Remember something…”Companies make money. Politicians take money.” Politicians produce nothing, but policies filled with words. Words that further enslave the ones “for whom the policies are written.”

POST_TEXT: b'Besides mine, I currently also manage the portfolio of my GF worth 10k with total gain of 1100 eu for now. Its all big tech (AMZN,GOOGL,CRM,ASME,SHOP,INTC) which I was fortunate to buy at even lower prices than they are now. However, my girlfriend has saved up another 8k euros and wants me to invest that as well. I am thinking of not investing in big tech because her (and my) portfolio atm basically only consist out of big tech companies. I therefore want to start investing in other sectors as well in order to diversify her portfolio, but my knowledge regarding stocks is basically all in big tech for now. So, what are some interesting stocks or sectors outside of big tech that you find appealing or think have good growth potential, so that I can get some inspiration or new ideas?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 01:05:17'] Unless she's specifically asked you to stock pick, if I were given 8k of **my girlfriend's** money to invest then I'd be tempted to put it in a few broad based funds/ETFs/trusts etc. I just don't like the risk of picking companies when the person who's money it is didn't even make the selection. Spread across value and growth the portfolio should grow over time and there won't be any big holes in it when a pick goes bust.

DCA/DVA into it. Consider selling a portion when they are up 50-200%. Then repeat the process. Otherwise keep DCAing into them and hold. This would be the best way to hedge such a tech heavy portfolio. Id honestly advise you to just blow it up though and start again. Get some commodity ETFs in there, and other non correlated assets.

	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 08:01:52'] CVS's biggest business isn't their retail pharmacy; it is insurance.  There will always be a need to brick and mortar pharmacies.  
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 06:51:36'] I think this is an overreaction, but it does confirm that Amazon is heading towards pharmaceuticals despite what reports said a few months ago.  That being said there's tons of legal roadblocks that amazon would have to get through so short term you should buy the dip.

	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 14:45:37'] I think it’s just in the moment drop... Amazon is big but to take over other companies like Walgreens, CVS, Walmart etc., going to be a tough play.Curious to see how this is going to play off.
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 07:18:45'] It will rebound in short term but I’m pretty pessimistic in the long term given Amazon’s history of destroying generic industries
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 09:01:53'] PillPacks goal was to make 100 million in revenue in 2017. Cvs made closer to 200 BILLION in revenue in 2017. As far as I’m concerned this is just an opportunity to buy more CVS
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 11:35:18'] RAD is fucked. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 14:50:20'] I sold COST after the news of Amazon buying Wholefood market at mid $150s. Look where is COST now. Just FYI.
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 23:18:31'] As a Pharmacy director who has met Pillpack’s CEO I can tell you this is not just an online pharmacy. This company packages medications in an easy to read pill calendar for people. It tells them how to take it, when to take it, side effects and does it with the patient in mind. They are a well run company with good people at the core. They are not an average online pharmacy. They are not an insurance company like CVS/Aetna. Therefore they are a competitor in that they are very focused on top notch healthcare but they do not offer insurance themselves. As an investor in amazon I am pleasantly surprised they bought this company. Not only does it show they are going into the medication delivery business but it also shows they are doing it professionally and with the patient in mind. They could have bought a sweatshop factory that sends way too many medications to patients to overbill their insurance passing the cost onto everyone. But they chose a company that actually is REALLY good for the patient. Helps them take their medications on time and is very convenient (we have a 30% return to stock rate at our pharmacy meaning 30% don’t pick up their meds on time). Very bullish on amazon but CVS will be caught in the crosshairs as you never know when amazon will buy an insurance company and keep it all in house. Hope that rant helps. Sorry if it’s long and redundant. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 10:54:10'] This one hurt CVS shareholders today. I looked at my phone after arriving at work and saw it was down almost 10% and knew something must have happened. I can't say I'm surprised by the move by Amazon as many speculated they wanted to get into the pharmacy/medication delivery sector. It will be interesting how this plays out for Amazon as I imagine there is a ton of money to be made if they can provide a quick, easy, and painless service for people needing their meds but there is definitely going to be a learning curve and a lot of regulations they have to figure out. I guess it's better they're doing this with an acquisition and not starting a new branch entirely from scratch. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 13:47:16'] Good that Amazon bought online pharmacy. As a consumer I expect it to be cheaper than retail stores especially the CVS (CVS is rip off)
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-28 14:12:00'] I hope they don't get into health insurance anytime soon. Bought a ton of UNH and made a lot of money from it.

POST_TEXT: b'I feel that AMZN is still undervalued because, firstly, it\'s so damn sticky it\'s likely to hold onto a large part of its newly expanded customer base (see below image & ticker news info from Bank of America). \n\n> Bank of America is out with some shocking statistics on Amazon (AMZN +1.7%) and the e-commerce\'s site dominance during the pandemic as part of its e-commerce survey update.\n\n> "60% of respondents search Amazon first when shopping online (vs. 58% last year), while 26% search Google first (up from 25% last year). eBay now at 3%."\n\n> "This period, 23% of respondents indicated they complete 76%-100% of online shopping on Amazon, down from 30% in 2019 and 26% in 4Q18.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-28 08:37:28'] AMZN will continue to grow for at least another ten years. I buy whenever i see a drop
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-28 08:17:13'] Even assuming that you're right, it doesn't guarantee the price will move before the expiration date on your call. There lies the risk with buying options.. You have to be right in two fronts, your thesis on where the price will move, and the timeframe within which that will happen.What intrinsic value did you estimate to determine that it was undervalued?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-28 10:05:38'] AMZN is difficult to price, because of the qualitative value of Bezos being the CEO. It may not be worth it's value right now, but the guy constantly launches new enterprises and consumes new markets to make it worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-28 12:34:07'] >it's so damn sticky it's likely to hold onto a large part of its newly expanded customer basIt might already be priced in (if not overpriced already). The stock rose +80% since the start of year before the pandemic hit. The actual impact on e.g. Q2 revenue with all the pandemic stockpiling was +40% revenue, the current price is already estimating a lot of future extra growth acceleration due to the pandemic (in addition to a lot of expected growth even before pandemic) that has not yet fully materialized in revenues/profit, I would also not assume the peak pandemic online shopping rates would remain the same in the next months and years if vaccine comes. Other than shopping AWS is a big part of Amazon valuation and while cloud stocks are hot and AWS remains at top for now - it no longer is such a monopoly in cloud tech that it used to be, as someone in IT - Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, even Oracle Cloud and IBM Cloud are being more widely adopted and will keep taking share from AWS in the cloud market and drive down profits due to fierce competition.>Secondly, it's got a lower risk factor over the next few months because it's still a pandemic stock and experts are warning that coronavirus cases can rise significantly this Fall/Winter.That is not really something unique to Amazon, almost all tech stocks are pandemic stocks due to increased digitalization everywhere and workforce that can work remotely. Amazon might be weaker than other tech as they still need to operate large warehouses which they will have to shut down if virus starts spreading there which would certainly hit their bottom line and put a halt to a lot of expected additional revenues.Point being it might have some more room to grow, but it also might already be overpriced until tech valuations are coming down to reasonable valuations (+50% YoY growth triggered by pandemic I personally see as high growth in the realm of reason, valuations doubling and tripling is bubble territory). I would in your shoes just buy shares instead of options, with such crazy growth already this year option plays are a very high risk activity and more like gambling.

And even if they aren't that good, we just saw in the last month that negative numbers don't really have a strong impact on the market anymore.Everyone can see what's coming in the near future... at some point soon, inflation numbers are going to subside, and everyone wants to get in front of the rally before it happens.

AWS(Amazon Web Services) is amazons fastest growing and most profitable segment of business and they hold the spot for #1 cloud company in the world. \n\nWith all that being said I think the stock has a good chance of pulling back after earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-28 09:35:43'] Amazon's Price to EBIDTA still looks pretty good, and provides a better view into this stock than P/E.   Amazon puts a lot of more of their revenue reinvested back into the business in infrastructure / R&D compared to their peers, so looking at their Earnings per Share can be misleading for this company.I have an estimated EBITDA Growth rate of \~25-30% over the next 2-3 years.  I would put the fair value as just above \~ 1:1 EBIDTA Growth rate. Current P/EBIDTA is 39.55 whereas the 3 year average EBITDA growth rate is 34.92%.  &#x200B;Similar to OP, i expect a slight pullback after earnings, unless EBITDA growth beats estimates by quite a bit.  I could see a temporary return to the $2600-2800 range, which would be a nice entry point IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-02 07:16:13'] OK I'll preface with my bias - I work in entertainment. But I 100% think streaming is going to keep rising. A lot of people are worried about the trade off between theaters and streaming -- I feel like it's actually the tv networks are at the expense of streaming SVOD and AVOD platforms. The reason being is mostly product -- when these streaming services announce their product, they might mention a few films but *it is always the tv series* that are the core to the platform. They are the Crown Jewels that keep people subscribed. Some examples:&#x200B;Disney: Wandavision, MandalorianParamount+: Star Trek franchise, Frazier, Rugrats, Avatar: The Last Airbender franchiseNetflix: Stranger Things, Bridgerton, Queen's Gambit, The CrownHBO Max: Sex and the City, The Flight AttendantPeacock: The Office, Law & Order SVU FranchiseHulu: Handmaiden's Tale, Dollface, Solar Opposites&#x200B;Of course this is just my opinion, but I think Netflix is going to get some good competition from the big studios who are now getting into international markets with direct-to-consumer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-02 09:03:23'] ROKU&#x200B;They already dominated their market share of streaming and they aren't really competing wit the other services, the other services rely on them.

It is a very countercyclical pick, but I have a long time horizon and think the reasonable bull case for “enterprise Google” as a recent analyst termed it is pretty great. It may not figure out how to make a profit for a while, but it currently is growing extremely quickly (though burning cash to do it) and each customer acquired has a very long tail for the company. I know B2B isn’t particularly sexy, but they solve a major business problem and do it better than anyone else. I wouldn’t be shocked if it hit Salesforce’s current market cap in a year or two, which would be 3x its current market cap. I just bought a lot of it and even though it’s down 4% on me after today’s rally I’m not devastated

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-10 05:12:51'] I’d by 1 share of Google and 2 of Apple instead of Amazon. Although Amazon is certainly a great buy imo, this gives a little more diversification.However keep in mind that Apple has been on an insane run and has a 23 forward p/e, while growing only 5-10%.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-10 10:04:30'] I wouldn't bet on Amazon or Apple for the next 10 years. Too many people coming at Amazon right now (Microsoft especially). Apple might be worth it if they turn into a bank with the Apple card & Apple Pay because they don't have the vision to churn out game changing consumer products like they used to. I'm not willing to bet they turn into a bank tho. Microsoft, Google, or Boeing are better bets.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-10 04:24:03'] If you're thinking hold long term look into ETFs SPYG is an ETF that holds both AMZN and AAPL. Diversify the 2k a bit better than holding onto one stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-10 09:46:00'] AMZN.AAPL is too much of a "brand" and consumer tastes can change or one bad year or two of product development can send it reeling. Its not going away, obviously, but  long term growth is more reliable in something that is not dependent on consumers loving them long term.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-11 17:22:14'] AMZN has raised their gross margins to 35% from 25% over the last year.  This was the plan since the beginning.  The market will not support an AMZN with no profits at the market cap they have now so the gross margin needed to increase to 35% (ie the deals are not as good as they were before).Wait to see if their sales are still growing at the same rate over the holiday season.If so, AMZN will be making a profit approaching $10 billion per year and will eventually take over the world with a profit margin approaching $50 billion per year some day which means buy it right away.But if revenue growth slows down to let's say 10% year-over-year, then the gross margin issue is bigger than people think it is and AMZN is then way overvalued and it will be time to get out.So you have to wait to see what the revenue numbers did over the holidays.  10% growth SELL.  20% growth BUY.   In between, is in between, up to you.  That is the scenario with this company (which I buy from a lot and think has tremendous value as a service to me - but that does not mean its stock price is valued properly).

What will you think of AMZN then?Look at fundamentals and financials, then make a decision (or better yet, determine a price target).
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-12 09:54:12'] Amazon evolves fast. They went from a book store to a mega store to offering AWS to probably 100 things I've never even heard of them doing. It's a "wildcard" company that keeps doing more and more.I see things going up in the short and long term.I also see a big presence in embracing what the internet is best at: allowing anyone to monetize their own talents. For example, a friend writes books and sells them electronically. She makes good money, is happy that Amazon takes care of providing a network for sales, advertising, communication, reviews, social presence, and so much more. Amazon is acting as a service to enable individuals to monetize their skills and interests, and doing a darn good job at it.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-11 14:59:37'] I think the future looks very good for Amazon. Definitely along term hold. If you agree then there is no better time than now to invest 
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-12 00:25:11'] The only thing I would say in caution is that I think AMZN will be more vulnerable than most to a macro level negative event. If there is a broad market pullback (which many say is due) or if a negative financial catalyst hits middle class consumer hard, then AMZN has the most inflated market cap and P/E ever seen. It is definitely at the top of the bull market wave, so has the most room to fall.DISCLAIMER:This is NOT necessarily my advice, but IMO you should ALWAYS consider the devil's advocate thesis before you buy anything.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-11 15:51:54'] I swinged at $940 to $1000 when they brought out Whole Foods. Solid company, low profit margins but huge revenue, if they could cut down on costs. That’ll be great news.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-11 20:50:04'] I’d say the limits for growth depend on government.

And they have to be nearly flawless every quarter to justify the current price, but that will be hard to do as they have 200 million customers..  20% growth is another 40 million.

This is a company that has growth in aws, domination in logistics and online retail and continues to expand across North America. It can only go up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-25 01:03:37'] I don’t know why, but I feel like Amzn market cap is too low for what they do. I’ve not done any financial analysis on this. I live in Germany and  if I just think about my daily life, Amazon is more a part of it that either Msft or apple. And then with cloud services, which is the backbone of an absolute ton of businesses, it’s really hard to bet against. Also hard to imagine that this quarter will not be a blowout for amzn. Govt regulation is a risk though...
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 22:02:01'] I think Amzn earnings are on 2/2, so if you’re buying calls for earning don’t do 1/29 calls, or at least confirm the date before doing so. I’m bullish on Amazon for the anecdotal reason that the number of deliveries they’ve been making where I live is seemingly unprecedentedly high. However, I also think there’s antitrust risk with this stock and also just because Amazon may have an eps beat, that doesn’t always mean that the stock will rally following its earnings. I’m tempted to do calls as well for Amazon and the risk/reward seems promising, but the premiums are so expensive (for me personally) there’s a good chance I’ll pass on it. Msft also looks like it could have an upside breakout too. With interest rates remaining low, I think it’s possible that these two companies could come closer to hitting the 2 trillion market cap if their earnings are better than expected. It will be interesting to see what happens next week. Also everyone seems bullish right now so that does make me somewhat nervous about the possibility of a sell off following earnings, so Im also thinking about whether to hedge with 2/19 puts near the open if we gap up tomorrow morning.

Thing is today Dow moved up 1% though AMZN didnt really follow.\n\nAlthough i know one day's performance means nothing it got me thinking that AMZN compared to the other giants is way too overvalued. The PE is just insane and wondered if (and noone denies AMZN will take over the world) it's time for the stock to correct.\n\nAny thoughts? Let's discuss :)"

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 12:38:34'] It was overvalued when I bought it at $189.  It was overvalued when I bought it at 371.  It was overvalued when I bought it at 630.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 11:55:57'] AMZN is trading on the potential an exceptional, proven CEO creates when he has access to unlimited money.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 19:56:06'] Bezos wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says “today, I’m going to shut down _____” dude is the terminator. He doesn’t want the cake, he wants the bakery, then he wants the crops that grows the flour, then he wants the earth that the crops on. He has a vertical business model and with it’s market cap continuing to grow, they will own the world unless the government tries to claim a monopoly. But wait, they bring so much money into US from Europe, let’s let them get away with breaking any antitrust laws. Even though on the books, it’s overvalued, you are buying the stock to make money on the stock, not the earnings per share. The argument is that they have the deepest pockets and the ability to take over any industry they want to.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 13:19:43'] Compare their revenue to their marketcap.  I think they could easily cut investments and spending and still justify the marketcap given their prospective growth.The biggest problem with them is that they are just too large so people assume growth will be slow, but really online shopping is still in its infancy.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 13:53:41'] I love $AMZN too, but I don't currently hold it. I think it will continue to go up, but at it's current size it's growth will start to slow over the next few years in my opinion. I still think it's a great buy and hold, but I like other opportunities more. I have quite a big position in $BABA because it's better value for money, has had crazy growth and should continue to grow for a while yet. That's where I'd put the money personally.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 15:37:47'] Ofcourse it is, it is extremely overvalued but I didn't buy it because of fundamentals, I bought it because it just keeps going up..You have to throw fundamentals out of the window in this market. Forget technical analysis, forget chart reading, forget PE ratio, none of that logic applies in this market..You buy into this market because it just simply never goes down. Ever
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 13:20:00'] The charts say pullback
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 16:36:18'] It's a bull market. There can be a case made that a lot of stocks are overvalued. AMZN is already up 10% this month. The Dow is up 5.65%. The Nasdaq is up 5.72%. AMZN still outperforming the broader market even if it didn't outperform for a single day.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 11:52:10'] Even if trump sanctioned against amazon, there wouldn't be any way of stopping this company from getting money. I'm staying in with AMZN.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-18 08:06:48'] I do most of my shopping on Amazon.  I have two shares from back in 2008 which I bought for $50 each.  It's been a tremendous time seeing it go 25X in 10 years.  So in theory, in 5 years that 25X would be 625X as we're recovering from a long recession.  My $100 investment would amount to $65,000.  Sweet.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-18 09:08:37'] In a bull market, overvalued stocks tend to get even more overvalued. This bull market still has probably 2 years left, so Amazon should be fine. But when the next bear market comes, its stock price will crater
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-20 01:11:14'] If Amazon didn’t reinvest their earnings in growth their PE would be much more reasonable. “Growth-investment-adjusted-PE” is what you should be looking at if that makes sense.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 18:41:10'] It won't correct unless there is bad figures.  They do over 100 billion in sales.  That is about 3 billion in retail profit margins and not to mention the value of Twitch and other services.  Their margins are slim like Walmart's and other retail chains but they would have to have a hiccup that would drop it down to reasonable levels.  Amazon's predictive modeling is sophisticated.  I think they have a lot more room for improvement such as the i don't know what I want but I want food or a new pair of shoes (Shoe sizes aren't saved for some dumb reason on Safari).  I also think they have a lot of flaws with their add on only items and prime only.  If I don't have prime, I will be put off by searching for food because everything is prime pantry when I search for items.  Add on on selected items is bad because it won't really dictate what it is until you checkout and then it will put it in your buy later list without notifying you.  Food too is something that tends to be a ripoff on the site as I tried to buy candy like Dove peanut butter chocolate 4 pack was 24 bucks when I can get that at Target for 16 and same with energy drinks.  I think they need to Costco a lot of their products and see if these companies will bundle a larger package of goods like that because a lot of items are on there with ridiculous markups.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 16:27:54'] Yes of course it will. When the market corrects or crashes those events leading up to the crash (we don’t know what they are yet) will cause the bubble to burst. When that happens typically we will see a devaluation on how the market prices stocks because there will be less activity and hype in the markets. Positions will close and money will leave he market. All stocks especially the highest valued (tech) will be less $. Will present great buying opportunity. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 18:12:51'] AMZN won't go down before the overall market does. But someday the market will go down. And it'll take AMZN with it. At that time, AMZN will take a bigger loss than so called "value" stocks. That's why they call them value stocks.I apologize that I'm unable to tell you when any of this will occur.
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-17 13:27:22'] The general public sentiment has turned against Amazon I think. I don't like the company. Everyone I know thinks they're a crap company and would rather shop elsewhere. They're just the only ecommerce game in town. Amazon is rarely even the cheapest retailer at this point.

	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 07:00:33'] people have been holding off on buying Amazon since it was at $100/share
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 07:19:14'] They don't need to beat companies like Netflix and they aren't trying to. All they need to do is provide ancillary services that bring in more Prime members because it's been shown Prime members spend significantly more than non-Prime members. Do you really think Amazon wants to own the streaming music industry? No chance. They're fine being a distant 3rd or wherever they currently are.The only industries I think Amazon wants to dominate right now is E-commerce, smart home assistants, and web services. Everything else is secondary.
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 08:31:58'] I look at Amazon like the three-sport athlete who is also running a dual major and is president of six major clubs on college campus. Everyone says that he's doing too much, but I can see that he's handling all of these things exceptionally well. My money is on this person
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 09:06:03'] Amazon is a scary company, they have a foothold now in most Peoples lives primarily through their online store and Alexa product line.  If I had the capital id invest heavily, they’re only going to keep getting bigger through acquiring closely related segments and branching into new sub-segments more frequently.  They really can just crush any competition with realitive ease
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 10:00:22'] As they said, there will be two kind of people in the world. Prime members and non prime members.

	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 08:44:13'] Yes, there is a risk in doing too much. GE is a good example. However if management is up to the task, this risk can be mitigated (GE’s wasn’t). 
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 15:18:44'] I don't want to generate a flame, there are controversial opinions usually on it. I will tell you my view. My personal opinion is that you shouldn't look where everybody is looking. Even if it grows 100% is size you have already paying 157 times the average 5 years cash flows (the net money it generates). So it would take big amount of time to get your investment back. True the company can grow. But companies don't grow forever and as soon as you start getting earning under the forecast also investor would start doubting it the greatly overpriced share could become less overpriced. Moreover everybody in this moment is trying to figure out a way of fucking amazon. They are hurting many many businesses and there are many of them even very powerful (Walmart+Google) that are trying to do something about it (Jet acquisition by walmart). I personally don't think they have a business that is no replaceable quite easily by other companies especially if they start to increase prices like they should if they want to become profitable.Buying an amazing company at a crazy price is never a good investment. A good book that explains that is the intelligent investor by ben graham. The extreme summary of the book is that very often companies that are over expensive tend to underperform, while companies that are the underdog tend to do better than the others even because nobody expects much of them. And honestly they're less risky costing less. In closure, It never happened in the past that there's a single company in the world and won't happen even though Amazon is trying to put a foot everywhere, they will stop growing so fast in the future, they'll grow less like many of the biggest company and the cost of their price per earning/flow will drop.Hope it helps.

	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 16:57:16'] An analyst I work with had a great line about AMZN: "Bezos was rewarded for growing the top line aggressively but has shown no ability to make an economic profit. At some point investors will begin to doubt the sustainability of future revenue growth rate and demand real profits."Basically, AMZN grew into a behemoth by capturing market share with razor thin margins. They have grown that market share immensely and the stock has gained off that. However, its ridiculous to think that they can grow at this same pace forever and, eventually, earnings and margins will need to grow. They are unproven in this regard, and expanding their margins would mean cutting costs (highly difficult given how they've built the business) or raising prices (bad).I think AMZN's best days are behind it. Cue the downvotes!
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 12:30:06'] Two words: Drone delivery.
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 13:29:17'] I figure it’ll play out like GE. They’ll be a cash cow for a long while and then the umbrella will get too big and they’ll be into too many industries that they’re not experts in and it’ll eventually cave in on them. I would expect amazon to get hit extremely hard in a recession. Mainly when all the industries they’re operating at a loss in gets cut to razor thin margins and their core pulls way back. But yea amazon is a meme stock akin to Tesla. All bezos has to do is say he’s getting into an industry and the stock will run up 10%. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 14:21:26'] I think regulation will stop them from getting their hands on everything. Or if they keep expanding to other things GE comes to mind. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 15:08:09'] yep they're doing too much, gonna crumble this year, short it. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 15:19:06'] Net present value of future earnings based on a marginal multiple dictates that AMZN is reasonably priced

	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 23:22:24'] As someone who is a daily user of AWS services at work...AWS is a fucking monster. It's a juggernaut. It may sound like an exaggeration, but I literally cannot imagine an internet without AWS.  Google is much more well known, but it's arguable that AWS is comparably as much of a 'backbone' to the internet. Cloud is still in the infancy stages (late toddler or so) and AWS is way, way ahead of Google/Microsoft/Alibaba Cloud.
