	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:32:40'] He is still CTO. I don’t know about the distracting part.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:42:11'] Well multiple people in the past complained about Elon micromanaging. No matter who the CEO is, he will continue question every decision

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 11:43:36'] I don't think he's actually that smart, so I don't think his presence helps Tesla or Twitter.He'll probably do less damage at Tesla since they still have some brand credibility and a lot of government support
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:50:22'] Dude wants to be a product guy so bad. Steve Jobs, for all his flaws, was actually interested in people. That's what made him so great at product - he was able to get into the customer's head and figure out what would delight them. He designed for other people.Elon designs for himself. If he can't understand how he might find a feature useful, it's not going in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 11:05:36'] He just wants someone to blame for it's eventual collapse
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:10:21'] CTO lol. What a twat
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:18:14'] he misspelled "psyops"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:11:54'] Super bullish, this fixes tsla’s plummeting margins, excessive inventory, and failure to capture market share in overseas despite heavy capex spending.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:15:36'] Okay. So this is noise. Tesla is just a car company and for some reason has gotten too expensive again. I guess this will pump the stock a lil but I personally think it doesn’t actually make Tesla more or less attractive. It’s just another story, the truth is in the balance sheet and not what the media says…
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:19:42'] no, twitter doesn’t have a CEO problem, it has an Elon problem.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:01:59'] He still owns it.  It's STILL going to be garbage.SpaceX STILL DEPENDS on him being too distracted to bother them.>bullish for investorsNo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 14:28:11'] Fuck no it's not bullish for Tesla. Have you seen what Elon's undivided attention did to Twitter? He's a massive liability in the midst of what seems like a full public mental breakdown. What would be bullish for Tesla is the appointment of a professional CEO and him backing off into a board position like Bezos.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:06:52'] Elon should stick to investing and not run anything directly
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:02:00'] I think it’s bullish for Tesla. Regardless of whether it was a distraction, why waste brain power trying to fix a garbage media platform.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:04:16'] The Elon Fanboiz sure are out in support of their dear leader.Tesla and Twitter both have/had the same problem: Musk won’t shut the fuck up, stop trying to be this edgy, cool dude, and just focus on business.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:13:10'] He wants to be cto, which is more work than ceo for a digital company. A role that he’s less qualified for. His comments about rewriting stuff and not understanding his own microservices architecture makes me think he’s about on par with an entry level developer (architects and experienced devs have publicly disagreed with him about his misguided statements), so what could go wrong?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:32:45'] Are we still paying attention to this attention whore?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 11:31:43'] There were a million Teslas recalled in China this morning, so not a great outlook. He also still is Chair and CTO among other leadership positions so I doubt much will change.His blue checks seems pissed about the new CEO though, so lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 18:49:37'] Gives him even more time to shit post with his alt right bros on Titter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:26:38'] If the assumption is that he's going to spend more time micromanaging Tesla, it's super bearish. Startup companies need all the hype they can get, so he was a good fit. But Tesla is not an startup any longer. His constant meddling (and continued hype on promises he can't keep) is harmful.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:50:03'] He hired a CEO to be the face of the company. He will be Chairman of the Board and continue to run the company. The CEO will be his minion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:16:21'] Why is it a news? LmaoStill push free promotion for a private company through public news.Private company he's still the owner.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:41:02'] Tesla buying Twitter is the end game. It will destroy Tesla's stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:29:54'] When was this dude actually a good leader?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:49:28'] I think it is bullish in the very short term: hours.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:07:43'] WEF ceo... a disaster in the making.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:19:44'] Unless he actually stops using Twitter, he is still going to be distracted by it. He is addicted to it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:43:56'] What idiot thinks Musk running Tesla has been what made it good? His contribution is money and publicity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:47:25'] People in this sub hate TeslaI get how you could hate Elon, but as an investor, how can you hate Tesla? Does anyone here really think Ford is prepared to catch up to Tesla let alone overtake? Ford is losing 50%, -$25,000 on every EV they sell. While Ford is figuring out how to cut their costs to sell at a sub 50% loss Tesla is building lithium refining factories to make their *already profitable* EVs even cheaper for the consumer and gain an even bigger market shareThen you have Optimus robots, FSD & energy in the development pipeline along with AI in some capacity. But you would rather invest in Ford?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 12:15:16'] People actually think Twitter was doing better before Elon bought it? Wild.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:27:15'] I'm almost 100% sure it will have such an effect 😎👌
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:37:38'] No. That was all a smokescreen anyway. Twitter is most likely going to tank and tank hard under the new CEO due to the relatively increased interest in Twitter being due to the vainglorious belief that Elon will provide a platform for 'free speech'. Once that trainwreck begins to become apparent, I expect Tesla to dip by a significant percentile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:08:08'] Nothing involving this degenerate is bullish.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:06:09'] Don't kill me for suggesting this but I am out of the loop so please forgive me.Could this be a distraction for the fact that a load of Tesla's have had to be recalled?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:14:50'] It will only be bullish for Tesla if he steps down as CEO of Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 13:26:22'] People on this thread saying he doesn't know what he is doing are funny.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:12:12'] I hope is not Amber Heard. That would be a shocker!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:59:55'] No, he is bleeding money and doesn't know how to stop it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:08:36'] The longer that asshole stays out of anything the better they do.  With him "gone", Tesla's quality has improved.  SpaceX was doing better when he was more focused on Twitter. He came back to shove his nose in and they blow up a rocket because he ordered them to launch in spite of concerns the engineers had. He's a dumbass who talks a lot, had the capital money for his buddy's idea, aka PayPal. Took PayPal's cash and reputation, screwing his friend over, and bought Tesla from the actual genius behind the vehicle.  Let's stop giving money and a mouth so much praise.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 13:09:47'] So he thinks having a 'Woman Shield' is going to make his bullshit antics more agreeable; while he still spends all his time running the company as CTO, Software head, and Strategy tard. Smort! He must be a real fucking genius. Having 'founded' Tesla, SpaceX, and oh wait..
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 14:10:18'] Nope Tesla’s next going to zero
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:36:29'] No, it was always the plan, he said it from the beginning. The transition took longer than he expected to get it to where he felt comfortable handing it off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 11:42:26'] Good riddance you incel pos
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 14:33:19'] All the experts in here think they are smarter than the richest (off and on) man in the world. If only he had reddit's insight he would be so much more successful, lmfao
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:22:42'] It’s just one less reason to sell TSLA’s stock.  Still very expensive with rising competition and repeated price cuts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:23:53'] He really wants to focus on his SpaceX program that is his real passion
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 13:14:42'] Elon is the man!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:33:18'] Twitter isn't a publicly traded company, so like wo fucking cares?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:40:32'] Lol the whole product is software, wat the CEO gonna do? hR and business relations?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:49:58'] He has to - he’s got bigger overlords at his public ventures.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:50:01'] I think the headline will bump the stock. But he will still be in Twitter in a different role, so medium-long term it will have no or negative impact.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 08:50:21'] Why does he say X/Twitter? Like SpaceX or Twitter he hasn’t decided which one she will run yet?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:12:47'] I am looking for a **book** written by the unannounced CEO entitled: " ***My*** *XX* ***days at TWTR under Elon***".
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:41:40'] If he can shut up, yeah sure
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:46:11'] How much do you want to bet his successor will be some inexperienced culture warrior wacko like Kimberly Guilfoyle or someone cut from that cloth?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:50:22'] He just ruined Twitter by hiring a WEF person to takeover.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 11:46:46'] I think the market is concerned about what's being used as collateral for Twitter's purchase. He almost certainly had to front a good bit of his stock in Tesla to get the financing. From the outside, it's unlikely that Twitter is worth even a fraction of what he paid for it, putting a default on the loans on the table.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 12:36:42'] Candice Owens?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 13:07:54'] Hope he doesn’t dedicate his newfound “free time” to some other “next” company
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 14:35:24'] He basically hired an ad broker to broke ads
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 14:37:28'] I put the over/under at January 2024 before she steps down due to his micromanagement
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 14:43:12'] He's fucked his own personal brand forever. When it started, Tesla was an early adopter in the EV market. Then it became a lifestyle brand. Now, it's in an ever-crowded market and has almost reversed aspects of its positive reputation.He also has the same issue of diverted resources - he still owns the white elephant, so he's got to feed it. And, you know, attention from a fuckin' idiot isn't a boon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 14:56:23'] 5x7 = 67 so I would say yes
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 15:02:17'] I think the edit was from syops to sysops

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 15:31:14'] Oooohhhhh
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 15:39:45'] Whatever 🙄
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 15:40:47'] Irrelevant to Tesla. There’s no indication that Musk will be less obsessed/involved with Twitter going forward, just that his role there is being rebranded for PR purposes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 15:48:06'] He should step down from Tesla too, a lot of the dumb ideas in recent history are his (ie removing radar)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 15:52:07'] It was Bearish When he became Twitter’s CEO, I would hope Bullish when he steps down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 16:26:01'] I don’t think I could be bullish on any company associated with Elon Musk after the dumpster fire that was his tenure at Twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 17:48:22'] You’re assuming he’s going back to Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 17:58:24'] ... MUSK IS ONLY A SMART INVESTOR at this point. He needs to stop tweeting and stop putting his hands on company business. Elon, you're rich but you're hurting your companies  and it's employees. Quit it. Bad Musky. Bad.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 21:41:58'] He's too Busy with his SpaceX.Tesla is just a way to make money for that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 00:55:41'] it might be bullish just because people think it's bullish but i know it makes no difference whether it's twitter ceo or not. he's been running two companies since the beginning. twitter is no spacex or tesla startup. it's almost nothing actually. just a website with some storage and some policies. virtually any asshole could run it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 04:48:33'] He should just seek twitter back. Oh wait he can’t since he fucked the value of it even more by being such a right wing idiot. Maybe he should just shit the fuck up about his politics and concentrate on just making money
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 06:04:53'] Hopefully he gets back to helping human kind as a whole not mean caveman groups. Push unity for a change, humans should really try it sheesh
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 06:07:42'] So he's tanked the value of the company he's managing right now. Why should anyone be happy about him paying more attention to Tesla (except Tesla shorters I guess)?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 06:19:27'] Tesla has a demand problem and a margin problem and a quality control problem. Elon is one of the problems, but most importantly, Tesla’s first mover advantage has eroded. FMA is what drove their high margins in the first place.Then again, since the short squeeze, Tesla never really traded against their fundamentals.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 09:21:11'] I wonder if she is going to have a kid with him.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 12:39:17'] Well, this was his plan although he regrets buying to a degree. I talk shit on ambien at night to, I just don’t have the money to back it up but I have bought at least thirty companies this month on ambien

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 16:15:12'] Elon announced his replacement just in time to cushioned the share price drop from the 1.1 million TSLA vehicle recall  for faulty brakes. What a convenient coincidence.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:48:20'] I do. But I also think his acquisition and work at Twitter is important. It’s like social charity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:25:58'] I say SpaceX is his most successful operation currently and its the one where he is the least involved. A good leader provides a strong vision and is able to identify and develop talent to reach it, he does that part well. But when he gets involved in the decision making, he constantly moves the goal posts around and makes too many arbitrary changes that eat up time, money, and energy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 06:25:45'] Tucker is the new ceo
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:32:34'] Oh yea forget about that space company he also runs…. Lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:45:12'] Kind of bullish, but major macro headwinds ahead for TSLA and the EV space.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 09:58:34'] Kind of wonder if he did much good at tesla anyway at this point.Would personally want him to step down from tesla instead and put someone more passionate in the role. Not enough insight to actually name someone within the company i think should take his place. But preferably an engineer and not a bean-counter.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 11:34:34'] This "war" is analogous to the war between iPhone and Android. People will always see iPhone (Tesla) as the higher quality premium product thus is more "attractive".

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 08:55:45'] Pretty crazy tbh. From my understanding, France is a very tough automotive market to break into. It’s incredibly nationalist towards its own car brands (Renault and Citröen), with the government owning a stake and having several subsidies to protect their market share. Same was true of Germany though. Was unheard of to see them bringing in tesla a few years ago and now France is following suit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 08:10:04'] I feel like this link up came out of nowhere but I'm happy it did. One of my friends who is super into $TSLA sent me the LinkedIn post and I knew I had to share it to Reddit so that everyone could be just as amazed as me.From my understanding on how it works, Tesla hooked up with Movella to use their Xsens Mocap Suit to digitize the movement for Tesla's brand new bots (which can be seen in the video). This works because AI is a set of algorithms that use data pattern recognition and the sensors on the Movella suits provide generated and aggregated data. Data that the AI of the bot can then use to move accordingly.I'm not an expert but this is what I gathered from the post and video. If anyone has something to add on please don't hesitate to!

Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nThe dip in Teslas YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 07:26:19'] My view, staying away from Tesla until either 1) it hits $150 a share or 2) the FSD starts working properly. I own a Tesla with FSD, and while FSD is impressive at times, it's not prime time yet. It feels like they are soooo close to nailing it, but that's been the case for a year now... they just can't cross the finish line. But, they are close enough that it's almost unthinkable that they won't achieve it at some point in the near future (ie. a couple years max). At which point I think Tesla destroys all its competition, especially if they produce a $25k car.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 08:56:37'] The good:Tesla is still the leader in EVs. Tesla’s charging network is superior to all other options & will help increase sales once competitor EV owners realize how much of a pain using alternatives are (for full disclosure I own a Tesla & a Rivian & would only consider taking the Tesla on a longer trip).  Yes, opening up their network to others will help, but this is also another revenue stream for Tesla too. Tesla has building EVs at scale in a profitable manner down very well & have battery supply issues solved more than anyone. They have a lot of pricing flexibility.Their buying process is more appealing to anyone under 60.The bad:EV competition is heating up, with more options, people no longer have to buy a Tesla if they want an EV. The overall EV pie may continue to grow, but I see their piece shrinking.Musk’s association is a turn off to some potential buyersUnless the cyber truck has something spectacular that’s been kept under wraps, they’ve waited too long to enter the truck market segment with an odd design that lacks mass appealActual full self driving remains a pipe dream Their lead in tech in general is rapidly shrinking as they’ve basically not innovated much of anything for years. Lastly, yes, while I believe they will continue to do well as a car company, there’s no reason for the stock to ballon back to previous levels either as their is no ‘wow’ factor there anymore nor any on the horizon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 20:49:16'] 2022 total EV production was around 800k. Tesla was around 550k of that 800k. In 2023 they are estimated to produce around 1.2 million car. More than double. They are opening new plants/factories in multiple locations all over the world. Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. In comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That’s per company. There isn’t a company that can produce at Tesla’s speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it’s going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That’s 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that’s a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. I know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. Tesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years. That’s 14 years. That’s millions of teslas and counting on the road for years to come before any other company comes even close to producing cars as fast as Tesla. By the time the other companies catch up it will be too late. Tesla is KING!!!!

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 05:35:05'] I imagine Musk revealing himself to the entire world as an alt-right narcissist combined with tech layoffs and upper management layoffs all over the state have probably combined to significantly reduce the number of people interested in buying a Tesla.I think people that do not know a lot of liberals do not understand how toxic the brand is now among a huge group that used to be the main consumer target. And unfortunately for Musk and shareholders, there are a ton of viable alternatives now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:11:21'] Market share of the EV segment is a terrible metric to look at for Tesla. The EV segment is rapidly growing, and eventually all vehicles sold will be EV's. Even in the most absurdly bullish case possible Tesla was never going to maintain a 72.7% share of the EV market in California.The better metrics to look at are 1) how many vehicles are Tesla selling in California, and 2) what's their market share in the total California Auto Market?Think of it this way,  Apple was the first company to sell smartphones, so they once controlled 100% of that market segment. Does the fact that Apple now only controls a fraction of the global smartphone sales today because other companies jumped into the smartphone market mean that Apple was a terrible investment? No of course not, Apple is selling more smartphones then they ever were back when they controlled 100% of the smartphone market.

I'll repeat: The Model Y will be the best selling vehicle in year 2023, outselling the Rav4 and Corolla, while having luxury vehicle prices.You guys are here to complain about the 1% of vehicles that have a slight issue that can be fixed easily."The interior is cheap."It's a minimalist design. If that doesn't suit you and you want thousands of parts in your vehicle, go for it. Have fun paying to get it fixed eventually down the line."It's not safe to drive."Literally one of the safest vehicles you CAN drive because there is no engine, the battery sits on the bottom meaning you have a low center of gravity, and the steel framing of the vehicle absorbs a crap ton of the damage during a crash. You may have heard the story of someone who intentionally drove their Tesla down a cliff to commit suicide with his family inside and they survived with quite minimal injuries. In fact, Tesla has probably the safest vehicle scores tested in their Model S, Y, and E."Their interior is cheap. That's how they are able to make high margins."The interior isn't luxury but that's not what you're buying a Tesla for. You're buying it for the technology they offer, supercharging network, more reliable EV, and the fact that other EV makers just aren't capable of producing a similar EV product. When you can play Steam games, have OTA updates to improve the cameras of your vehicle without replacing them, increase the efficiency of vehicle range, etc., let me know. No one comes close to Tesla in software and tech capabilities. If the tech isn't for you, don't buy a Tesla. It's really that simple. You're wasting your money.The reason Tesla's margins are higher has to do with lower battery costs, lack of a dealership network, way more efficient manufacturing processes, and they are a master at saving money because they worked at the company since the inception and know every part that isn't required. Current legacy automakers leadership took over when those car companies have been constructing vehicles for nearly a century. They're more concerned with the financials than the engineering within the company which is why they allowed some random guy who owned PayPal to come in and dominate the EV industry despite having no experience in vehicles. Musk was in Tesla before they even had a vehicle out so they had to start from point A and thus, everything was designed for maximum efficiency and lower cost.Again, if the tech isn't for you, please do NOT buy a Tesla. There are better vehicles at that price you can buy. But if the tech is something that you enjoy using, it's one of the best vehicles to drive.

Right now Tesla is the most unreliable EV when stacked against others. That bad rating and their known habit to disregard quality WILL be a stain on Tesla's reputation long-term. As the Tesla novelty fades and the EV market becomes more diverse, there will have to be a reliable vehicle left to contend against decades of component-level quality control in other manufacturers. Without addressing fundamental issues in quality and reliability, Tesla itself will be left behind. It'll be the next "throwaway car" so to speak.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 15:58:47'] Profit is less of a factor than subsidies from printed money
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 16:12:47'] Apparently, this seems to be a popular post on Reddit as I have seen it in 3 subs already. I am posting what I have already posted in another sub here.This is one of those articles that presents selective data to highlight a narrative. To be honest, even that is not done very well. :) Don’t get me wrong. I understand that Tesla has a significant advantage at the moment given its manufacturing muscle. However, the situation is not as dire for other companies as the article tries to portray. Remember, Tesla was in the same state as others just a few years ago.Anyway, first things first. Despite the article’s intention, the authors had to present some kind of comparison data to appear fair. Unfortunately, they cherry pricked reporting data for different timeframes for different companies. Even then, it is not difficult to see numbers that matter by paying attention.For example, Nio’s net loss(not gross) per vehicle was -$19k per vehicle in q4 2020 and it was estimated around -$13 k in Q3 2022.  It’s gross profit was actually around +$10k in q4 of 2020 and Tesla’s was around $10.5 k. Of course, the article doesn’t show the gross profit for q3 22 for Nio.. :) Same applies to most other car companies data in their ‘analysis’ if we can call it.When one is ramping up production and other costs, it is expected to eat into net profits. All in all, this is a very misleading article focusing on selective facts without providing proper context.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 17:10:48'] I’m pretty sure Tesla is the only one building their own batteries. How much does vertical integration bring you here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 17:44:39'] Ok, so doesn't show the amount made from financing, the breakdown for additional sales ( warranties, maintenance plans, and other bs etc.), nor the amount on hold back that dealer doesn't have to claim on MSR or if they bought in volume the price influx. This article is misleading just jamming a number in with out the break downs from build cost to customer purchase including payments.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 17:47:14'] Nio is actually breaking event this is deceptive

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 17:59:10'] I wonder how much of the conventional car makers' profits are being eaten by the dealerships. The dealership model is one of the big reason why I don't want to go for a conventional brand.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 18:22:25'] The model s is like 10 years old.  That’s like dog years old in car model year terms.  Tesla had a head start.  They’re gonna be hurting real soon now. I see rivians on the road all the time. I may have seen a lightning I don’t know - it’s just a truck. GM has trucks coming out.  The bread and butter is high margin trucks. The cyber truck may look cool to some (I think it looks like it came out of the Mac game Spectre back in 1993) but those flying buttresses reallllly make it a lot less useful as like, a truck
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 18:33:44'] Affordability wins out in the end. Whoever gets an EV that most of the population can afford (at a profit) will likely be the leader in the long run.

With every solar panel, every EV we purchase, we're destroying OUR energy industry which is made up of natural gas and oil. We must equate us resisting this so-called "green energy" as a patriotic endeavor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 05:48:43'] Two-time Tesla owner here -- a large portion of that margin comes from shitty build quality and non-existent interior. Neither are things they can get away with now with the flood of incoming competition.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 18:48:48'] Why is this good?  They’re stealing money from buyers to produce an inferior product?  Wouldn’t you rather have a nicer car with less profit?  I won’t ever own a Tesla but this graphic infuriates me. It’s not a good thing, it’s a terrible thing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 21:04:28'] Is Polestar included in the VW profit margin space?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 22:55:22'] Nio is surprisingly bad.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-04 20:53:11'] It’s not the price. It’s that only a small minority of people want an ev. They’ve been around 20 years and less than 1 percent of the us has a telsa.  If there was a big market gm ford and Toyota would jump in heavy producing them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 04:21:00'] Margins are almost exact to the money given back by the government for people to buy EVs which ran out after this Q3… and they lowered their pricing. So this looks more like Tesla just eating up the incentive pricing instead of passing it down to the customer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-04 20:59:04'] So.  Wait a five or 10 years and reevaluate this.  When you do, be sure to include each year averaged out and then average all 5-10 years, or however many you use, as an overall metric for their profit across that span.  Then, we can talk.  It still doesn't mean something catastrophic can't happen to ruin one or all of the companies' production lines in the future.  But at least there would be some clear cut objective evidence of profit.  Not the only evidence needed, but better than this at least.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 05:26:28'] Is this self reported? Wasn’t there an article years ago that said Tesla calculates their gross margin differently than other manufacturers because of R&D?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 06:05:02'] so steering wheels falling off are a feature of good margins. got it
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 06:43:05'] When they start sharing that profit to investors, let me know
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 06:55:41'] This is before they reduced their sales price by 13k right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 10:58:18'] They’ve also degraded the quality of parts they’re putting into their cars. Shittier car at a premium price means even higher hustle off the idiot consumer buying these shit heaps.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 04:14:45'] First off…. Be very wary about basing your investment decisions on stories in Yahoo! Finance.   Other sources to steer clear of include Seeking Alpha and Business Insider (among several).KMusk has no control over the current timing of these sales.   He was granted options and, back in December he put a 10b5-1 plan in place to exercise and monetize those options over time.If you don’t know what 10b5 is, Google it.  The rule was just expanded (requiring more information from sellers and increasing the conditions that must be met in order to qualify) by the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler in December 2022.Had this not been a 10b5-1 sale he would not have been allowed to sell the exercised shares so close to earnings. Not only does the timing mean nothing, it’s existence would have been disclosed in Tesla’s last quarterly report, so this shouldn’t be news at all to anyone who is particularly worried about this sort of thing.Yahoo! Click baitI have never owned or shorted any shares if Tesla.  I own PSNY and Lucid convertible bonds.

And since this is a stock sub that’s good news for Tesla STOCK. Y’all thought buying Tesla cars when they were super high was some sort of elite club you were forming, reality was supply, and demand, and all you did was all in FOMO. Tons of people said wait until prices readjusted, but nooo, you wanted to be first, and you paid the price. Nothing to be salty about. You wanted, you got, now you regret it, and somehow that too is Elon’s fault. I’m glad to see the price come down, I hope they sell even more, because I own stock in the company, and I’m not trying to be in some kindergarten exclusive club. Smh

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 03:54:16'] I'd say given the significant competition Tesla is now experiencing, the obvious need for a partnership is key to the company's survival. Otherwise, Tesla may become a niche EV manufacturer with maybe 15% market share in the already tiny EV sector just 6% or so of all automobiles sold are electric.  And Tesla / Elon Musk apparently did not foresee the big picture, involving infrastructure, supply chain materials problems including access to rare earth metals and regulatory issues on autonomous vehicle technology, a feature that weighs heavily in Tesla's valuation. Further, the lack of lithium reserves worldwide are now driving the development of alternatives like sodium ion battery technology.  So, examining Elon Musk's shift to buy Twitter indicates he either wanted to diversify money out of the EV market purposely because he recognized the limitations coming, which essentially left investors holding the bag ... or he made a bad choice, given Twitter adds no short-term value to Tesla. Elon could just as well have bought a sodium ion battery company which would have made a lot more sense adding significant value to Tesla, enriching investors.

But that being said, people who buy brand new cars really arent good "investors". Even going 1 year old youre looking at substantially more value retention than if you bought brand new. You chose to eat the largest chunk of deprecation up front. The car is worth what youre willing to spend. You must be naive to be surprised that theyre capable of making profit at 16% less. The quote " It’s such a large reduction that it’s going to affect a lot of people who just bought a vehicle.” is pretty silly though, as you are in the exact same spot with the same vehicle as you would be if they didnt cut prices.

I'm not a Sinophile, I think investing in China right now is a major gamble and personally choose not to. Others can based on risk tolerance, but Munger's obsession with Chinese companies will only end in tears (after his ancient ass has passed and those who listened are affected by any fallout with China in the future).

Their range per charge was like half of what was promised. They also did not fit with the loading platforms that were constructed specifically for the specified buses. There was probably some over-site by the city and the architecture firm (the whole project was a major headache tbh), but the fact of the matter is BYD basically lied about the quality of their product and instead of fessing up, the city had to sue them to recoup losses. So my opinion of them is not great.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 12:47:03'] The only thing BYD is ahead of Tesla in is sales volume in China. However, Tesla makes 8x more profit per vehicle sold and 5x more profit overall. BYD’s volume leadership is accomplished by selling really cheap electric cars that barely turn a profit. In segments where Tesla and BYD compete head to head, Tesla outsells BYD - the Model 3 and Y way outsell the BYD Seal, Han, and Tang in the ¥200-¥300k price range (and this is on BUD’s home turf, it barely exists outside of China and Tesla dominates in US and even Europe). Once Tesla releases a model under ¥200k, BYD might not be the leader in China anymore, and Tesla’s margin advantage and lower prices recently will put pressure on BYD’s profits in the meantime.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 08:14:31'] This is not a defensive Tesla, it's employees, or anything musk does. It's a simple reality that business sucks right now on a major level across the board and when you read the stock markets and go through various companies perspectus, you see this over and over we're large box stores or large retail chains or even large corporations like alphabet or Google are starting to take a hatchet to their employee list.Economies have consequences and we are still suffering post-pandemic economic chaos. It's really boils down just to that for the very simple black and white line that we are in a very difficult economic situation that could potentially lead to a deep recession or even a depression. A clear example that you can't spend your way out of debt, just on a global scale.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 05:21:59'] For anyone wondering, the people fired were in labeling an area that has been in the middle of being removed by dojo since its inception.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 06:18:34'] No they didnt.It was a bunch of temporary workers doing auto labeling and that job was replaced by DOJO.    They are trying to unionize after the fact for a job that was always temporary.

Seems very obvious that you don't fire people who just publicly stated they want a union. You at least try to do it in a roundabout way like Starbucks. Not sure what Tesla thinks is going to happen. Edit: > the people fired were in labeling an area that has been in the middle of being removed by dojo since its inception.

Not defending a lot of the presenters stumbling but they do know their shit from the FSD, electrification, powertrain and the software and hardware improvements, did you catch the manufacturing improvements? Ethernet cabling connecting with less transistor boards oh and even less transistors built in house to be more efficient cheaper and more powerful and more energy for your car…you really should watch the video and look at the many efficiencies, but don’t worry all of that gets you their next gen platform which is why the Mexico plant is being built, later this year I bet they announce not only refreshes but they eludes to around ten models to be happy around for the portfolio, so maybe we hear two or three of those by 3rd quarter.

The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Teslas NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.\n\nGMs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w6kuajo6x5b1.png?width=732&fo"

Price cuts might not have such a impact eventually, but it will trigger hype due to speculation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 09:35:07'] The price cuts for the US market to make the eligible for tax credit will not help. Regardless of what everyone is saying, I strongly believe there is a demand issue and it might even accelerate in the near future. The economic downturn is not at all over. Even if inflation slows down, there is still inflation. This means more job cuts and less consumer spending. Just because YouTube influencers talk about new Tesla offerings, the cyber truck or magical margin improvements, does not mean demand will look better for the coming quarters. I assume at least three quarters of headwinds, given that evaluation is still high. Stepping back from all the hoopla for at least six months seems to be s good idea. Don’t hope for the next short term options play. Don’t gamble away your money.

I have republican family members i love and respect.  Who cares that he bought twitter and is running it how he deems necessary?  Why is everything he does such a crazy big deal.  Bc people are stupidly enraged by him & the media is feeding into it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:01:20'] Bold of you to assume that Tesla will actually deliver the semi truck today
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 07:58:00'] Tesla's biggest problem has been not sales but production. If it builds enough electric semi truck production lines. I think this will really be reflected in its stock price
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:14:21'] Would think so. HAving done some sums, I don't think the truck is actually all that special. For example, Volvo's Class 8 EV truck the VNR, it its top form has a 565 kWh battery and a claimed 275 mi range. So it's about 2 kWh/mi or thereabouts. Tesla are claiming 500 mi? 2 kWh/mi?  So I think they're not really ahead in terms of efficiency or anything, but would seem to have a lead on packaging. For their claim they need about twice the battery and I guess a clean-sheet design would allow them to package that in better than the old guard.The real meat is whether they've made something that, in 500,000 miles, still works great. They're not known for building particularly high quality cars are they. That kind of performance will not wash in the heavy duty market. It just won't.As an aside, I didn't realise, but it seem Volvo have quite the range of applications for their EV trucks. They have a pretty wide offering!

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:06:36'] Nobody knows how to price Tesla right now because the CEO is having a fascist meltdown on social media, which he foolishly bought into. What you have to price in is how much Tesla management are able to insulate the actual geniuses from the toddler throwing a tantrum in another company's boardroom.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 21:22:27'] Cool news. No gripe against Tesla. Clearly the infrastructure for vehicles like this and the range are a concern. Outside of where the actual power is coming from, most of the concerns come about the battery technology. Lithium Ion was developed in the early 90s is shitty for these its why explosions and fire is a big concern. I am not patent expert with enforcement but the one who gets the batteries right is conceivably could be the "big oil" pick your name Exxon, Chevron, BP, Saudi Aramco of the battery space.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:03:22'] To be clear, we just saw the post for the first 500 mi drive in this truck less than a month ago. I would be very surprised if these were anything other than limited production test vehicles, and Pepsi is probably getting them for free in exchange for test data under load.So I don't question that they were "delivered", but I definitely question if Pepsi paid money for them. And I doubt there's more than 10 of them; probably only 2 or 3.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:26:24'] While a cool idea in theory. I really struggle to see this being a thing. 1. teslas production sucks ass.2. The base that cares about EVs isn't truckers. Truckers like to fix their own trucks and (no offense to any out there) aren't the brightest. Stopping at McKinnelys on 95 for a GPS/Light are 9000% easier than trying to fuck with a Tesla. 3. I don't see how Tesla could keep up with Lithium. The price has tripled in a year. The Battery for these things would be HUGE it's almost impossible to imagine how much it would need to be running 18 wheelers all year non stop across the country. Imagine breaking down in bum fuck Alaska waiting for a battery at -15.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:12:22'] Two ways of looking at it:To preface, I think they’re an innovative company with good ideas. I like the company… but the market cap seems unreasonable.So,1. The stock is very overpriced and this information is irrelevant as it fails to justify the high market cap and and high multiples. The share value is based on both the actual growth and innovation as a company as well as “irrational exuberance” for future prospects that are difficult to justify. It often seems that the stock, itself, is more acting as a catch- all for electric vehicle investment.2. Regardless of the intrinsic value of the stock, positive news like this will cause positive investor sentiment. The price is already wildly high so it’s very possible that any bit of optimistic view will continue to push it up (at least, to a point.)Not knowing the future the company could be undervalued for all I know. I tend to think the high price isn’t justified, but again, we’re all just going off our best estimates. I tend to think that the price is unreasonable and unsustainable, but regardless of that news and sentiment can keep stock prices unreasonable for unreasonable periods of time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 10:49:31'] The semi isn’t really much of a factor into the stock price. It’s important but it’s a drop in the bucket. Autonomy is what would move the SP. Semi production would matter at that point but there’s still time. Not only does FSD need more polish, it then needs to get approval before it can get set loose. I don’t think it’s as far off as most would think but it’s also not within Elon’s timeframes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 16:15:11'] They're expected to deliver 15 semis today at the event, but if they pull an Oprah & point to various other semi reservation holders at the event & say, "You get a semi!" that will provoke some excitement for shareholders at home (these theoretical other folks would have already ponied up the funds, no surprised Pikachu face from them).We'll see. "What's in the back?" \[Robotaxi prototype rolls down a ramp\] "Wooooo!!!" We're off to the races. But realistically, much of what's expected to happen has already been priced into the TSLA share price. It's the unexpected that would move it. Given the higher battery materials cost, the prices are likely higher now. Also mostly priced in, but if it's significantly higher that might cause some downside concern.The big move to the upside or down, though, is probably the next FOMC rate decision on Dec. 14th.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 17:53:13'] Smug Tesla owners thought they could flip their cars after a few years of driving and get their money back.Cry me a river.Its a car not a investment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 03:39:52'] You had enough money to buy it when it was expensive and was happy to pay it. So what’s the problem now?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:41:53'] I bought a bunch of stock last year, the price dropped, why don't I get my money back while we're at it?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 16:29:47'] Used Tesla prices are almost doable now. Owners have been spoiled for far to long being able to sell used for what they bought new for.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:41:22'] They thought they bought a premium brand but it turns out it was just a Toyota Prius with worse reliability.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 03:20:41'] Because Tesla owners are spoiled entitled losers. Only time in history price cuts are being seen as negative for consumers
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 00:10:45'] This is a good thing. The more affordable EVs are the more they’ll sell. The more they sell, the less dependent we are on the Middle East and Russia. There’s a huge surge in Tesla demand with the price cuts. And a big FU to the competition the administration cherry picked prices for. Tesla is still profitable at these levels. Ford and GM are not. I’ll be happy to see more EVs on the road in general and this move does that. Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. They’re staying true to that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:28:47'] Lol, crybabies
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:52:33'] I think what some people are angry about is that they bought a Tesla weeks before the price drop. They feel stilted because they may be stuck at paying the higher price. I don’t know if Tesla has anything in place for price drops on purchased vehicles or not, but to give an example on how they could correct this in good faith, give a refund back to their customers who purchased a Tesla in a given timeframe for the difference in price.I’ll rip a page from the Apple playbook:https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/sales-policies/retail_us.html“Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections…Should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to visit an Apple Retail Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events, such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday.”So if I bought a MacBook Pro 5 days ago and Apple dropped the price today, I could call Apple and get a refund for the difference in price. Tesla could do the same thing with their vehicles if they wanted to. Again, I don’t know what kind, if any, price guarantee Tesla has.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 16:22:21'] Hard enough staying smug driving a vanity plate Tesla with Musket firing off tweets like a 12yr old with unlimited Adderall on 4chan, now owners who paid full price seeing the riff-raff picking the same car they have at Walmart rollback prices? Inconceivable..
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:33:20'] What fuckfaces. The company can Price the product how they want. Your problem for overpaying for a car.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:31:01'] Tesla has pushed back the truck another year.  Tesla is a car company. It’s just no longer an innovative car company. Don’t get me wrong. Tesla changed the world.  But like every business you have to say, What’s Next?  How do we stay ahead of the competition? Musk is no longer focused. As such Tesla could lose not only it’s domination but it’s ideas for what’s next.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:49:31'] This is hilarious. They made a conscious choice to buy at higher than normal prices, but yet expect a refund when prices lower. That’s not the way the world works. Imagine buying a home, the housing market crashes, and now u want the difference between the price u paid and wat it’s currently worth 🤦‍♂️. Companies drop (and raise) prices all the time on goods.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:03:38'] Why all the name calling.  Everyone has a right to not be happy, but calling people names and bringing others down; seriously.  We have to learn to get along.I am 60, and have known my entire life, when something new comes out you pay the price; hence why I never had a new product to market…. You get how you buy things. Learn what you are buying and make a decoy from that and learn from it.  NO INE ELSE FAULT, but your own!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 09:50:34'] But everyone knew EVs would get cheaper in the future not unlike TVs
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:05:52'] They all thought they were somebody special, being able to splurge on a fucking battery-operated toy car that malfunctions and/or bursts into flames. Speeding around like a bunch of fucking ignorant egotistical assholes because they think they're separate from the rest of society because they have some unique piece of shit. They're no better than Mercedes or BMW drivers.That said honestly I don't know why the fuck they're bitching but that's just my take on the type of people that buy this piece of shit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:57:01'] Elon: *Breathes*Media headline: Consumers angry with Tesla over carbon emissions. Sell all your stock now
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:57:19'] Yeah fuck off. That's what you get for blowing your load on a "status" symbol
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 11:10:44'] Best part is when the price goes up, people don’t want to give that difference to Tesla. Yet when the price goes down, people feel entitled for their decision to purchase at that time. Same goes for anything we purchase.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 11:20:36'] I remember when LCD 1080 screens were first becoming a thing; went and bought me a brand new 40 something inch flatscreen for six & change. Had it for 6 months, deployed for a year, get home & was walking thru Wal Mart when I saw my TV on sale for $175. I was still paying off the store card I bought it with. Two things didn't happen after that day: I never bought brand new premium electronics from the store ever again. I also didn't write the CEO of Panasonic or LG or the Walton family crying about how the price change makes my stuff more affordable for the poors, or demand the difference. What reality do these spoiled entitled fckwads live in??

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 15:12:30'] Early adopters always pay the highest price. You pay a premium for having something new first. That happens all the time with TVs for example. I paid $4,000 for an LG OLED a few years ago and just bought another one for $2,500. It is what it is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 16:18:29'] Fucking wait morons. Jesus Christ. Stop over paying for shit dumbasses. If you stop paying prices will drop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 01:35:32'] They did it because MULN is going to offer their EVs for less than $60k

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 00:06:50'] One aspect of narcissism is that you can never admit fault.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 07:25:04'] Not true. Tesla specifically doesn’t have a large marketing department nor spend money on advertising because Elon does most of his marketing via Twitter. Internally, if a change for the company, it’s products or processes are announced for Tesla on Twitter, it’s taken as a directive for the company. So he can market the company on Twitter for positive gains but when his posts are unsavory or unpopular, no effect for the stock price? Absolute nonsense.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 01:21:36'] He totally should never shut up, there is clear correlation between his mouth/tweets and stock price. Drive that shit to the ground.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 03:14:03'] In my eyes, he's guilty on all accounts!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 08:22:51'] Whether it drives price anot, Elon sure drive pple here nuts 😂

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 06:48:07'] Bullshit. Tweets he will take Tesla private at $420 a share and that's not going to affect the price? Amazing how all these rich idiots and politicians can just lie without consequences.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 04:04:08'] No definitely not his tweets, it was the news about the company…which he just happened to release exclusive via tweet…
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 02:38:33'] Keep talking son.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 07:35:23'] Bull shit. Elon your damn words move markets and you fucking know it does. With great power (mainly wealth) people come chasing whatever it is you’re doing.  People usually try to do what the cool popular rich people do. They emulate to the best of their abilities. You sell they sell. You buy they buy. There are almost zero independent thinkers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 06:32:52'] Can’t they easily report trade volume on days after his key tweets? I feel like this case is a slam dunk, but obviously it sets a weird precedent for executives and what they can and can’t say on social media. Also, how would Musk’s tweets be any different from any other optimistic opinion piece from an exec?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:21:36'] “Nuh uh”- Elon Musk

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 01:01:28'] He only thinks that because by his definition in order for the tweets to drive the stock price someone would have to have both hands on the wheel of the stock price the entire time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 05:45:26'] Something something Musk is an idiot something somethingIs it my turn to have upvotes now too?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 04:10:47'] I feel like it's pretty obvious his tweets didn't send the price higher. I have an absolute dislike for the man but I'm sure it has more to do with wall street pumping his stock than his tweets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 06:52:18'] His COVID-19 lies drove a million Americans to their early, preventable deaths.He conspired with Trump et al to deceive Americans about the risks of COVID-19.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 10:49:26'] Tesla has a massive lead and has built out their EV production infrastructure utilizing historically low interest rates. Legacy auto does not have the same luxury and will be paying top dollar and top interest rates while scaling up production on EV’s they lose money on per unit soldSure Tesla could definitely get squeezed lower in a global recession but what is your investment time horizon?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 17:27:58'] I have to disagree being an owner of the actual car.  I would never even look at another EV.  Bottomline is range is amazing and the charging network is incredible.  All other competition falls short.Weather the stock is properly valued is another question.  With the margins per vehicle and the other businesses you cannot just compare them to another car company.  You have tons of research now going into training neural networks with that crazy super computer they just custom designed.  Off the charts investment in other things vs just toyota who is just a dinosaur.There certainly is a value reasonable somewhere.  It was way overpriced. Now it’s getting more appealing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 08:08:42'] I think when they first came out it was impressive and they had an opportunity to be first mover.Supercharger stations was a big risk that paid off to continue being first mover.Today, saw an ars Technica article that essentially showed they were pretty average in range now.  They were also like a mid to low brand for reputation on consumer reports I think.Though I always thought they were overvalued all the way up.  This is really first time I feel like they no longer have the first mover advantage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 12:03:33'] Parts of tesla is a car company. But many parts are not. For example Tesla makes its own chip and software.Fair valuation is another story.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 11:11:15'] What about all the data that they are gathering and putting together? I dont think they just make cars.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 11:24:09'] I disagree still, what Tesla is doing is innovating. They also keep data on all sorts of driving systems as well as infrastructure systems. I also believe if you look at what Tesla’s have to offer, the general direction most major auto maker seem to be following suit which makes me believe they’re paving the way for the EV industry.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 05:04:55'] That is what critics have been saying all along.I admire Tesla, but at the end of the day it’s just like car company like any others. The Tesla fanboys made the narrative was that Tesla would have more data and would therefore have better autonomous vehicles in the future. But anybody with little understanding in machine learning knows that gathering data is not issue for big companies. Other car companies could easily ramp up data collection. However, this autonomous vehicle things is still years away, and never been closed as Elon has promised countless of times.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 09:18:27'] .... no it isnt
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 11:12:50'] Any idiot that believes this article need not to be investing in anything. Tesla is not just a car company…  its a massive data company, solar power, and probably most importantly a battery company. The Mega Packs that they’re producing are second to none. Once a major state (like Texas) buys hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Mega Packs. This company will make hundreds of millions dollars in profits (not revenue, profits). Not only on packs but service and maintenance. If you believe this FUD then you must be smokin dicks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 11:34:59'] The thing about Tesla is that they not only monetize the selling of the vehicle, but also their charging stations as well. Most car companies only handle the vehicle distribution and it ends there, but where oil companies then take the money for fuel, Tesla then makes money from people charging.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 16:04:53'] It’s not going to compete with value EV cars offered by the likes of that company partnering with Walmart once they become mainstream. Tesla is too much of a luxury good.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 17:45:42'] This post and many comments here completely miss the point. Tesla is incredibly profitable [exceeding Toyota](https://electrek.co/2022/11/08/tesla-tsla-earns-8-times-more-per-car-than-toyota/) in net profit this year while selling 1/10 the number of cars. Also, nearly all ICE manufacturers are selling fewer cars each year and have slim profits at best. Tesla deserves a high PE bc they offer growth with enormous FCF. Rare indeed in any industry, nevermind auto. Software sales haven't materialized yet, but when if/when they do...watch out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 17:48:55'] I can’t remember the exact number, but when 80ish percent of your revenue comes from cars, I could never understand why anyone viewed it any differently. And that’s perfectly fine, but it was always a car company.

I had to run a dcf model on the company for work and using consensus inputs for the next few years and came to the conclusion the company was pretty fairly valued (before the run up in the last few days). Pretty reasonable assumptions in my model too: perpetual growth at about 4% (roughly the nominal gdp growth of the last expansion, and the company’s current WACC.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:52:17'] Tesla has a substantial lead in the EV space and competition is playing catch-up which they will eventually. With less than 10% penetration in the global vehicle market EVs have a ways to grow to the projected 50% target by 2030. So it’s just the early innings for this projected trend and like most markets there are the haves and the have nots with plenty growth ahead.

Take your profits before someone takes them for you. Price cuts & market share loss will hit next earnings report. Tesla was always priced for perfection.

If you believe it’s worth substantially more or less, then you must believe that the company either:1) outperforms the forecast (top line, bottom line, etc.) or2) that there’s inherently less business risk than is broadly perceived (i.e., you use a lower discount rate)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:52:09'] There is no conflict of interest.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 04:52:47'] I don't have data at hand, but I can't believe that Tesla never raised 33% in one week during the last market bubble. I owned Tesla for a while since 2019 and I remember daily movements of over 20%. That doesn't necessarily assume a weekly gain of 33%, but I would be extremely surprised if this data turned out to be correct.

Fisker $FSR asset light business model will prove very competitive. Further Shorty has over 33% of $FSR  float SHORTED. Obviously like Game Stop $GME they are attempting to create a false impression.

I personally like the Jaguar I-PACE and Mustang Mach-E over the Tesla (brid car) Model X…Plus Tesla doesn’t even feel exclusive or luxurious anymore bc you’ll notice every mofo looking douchey as fuck in their Tesla… (I am Asian in the Chicago suburbs) and legit every brown motherfucker has that car here and they just look so full of themselves, I did a test drive at a dealership once in the model X and I just felt awkward and grossed out driving it… (I could just feel the douchynes vibes flowing off of me)… I’m glad in the end we opted out to get Audi Q4 E-Tron

And we had to rely on Elon’s leadership, the stock was going lose a ton of it’s value, especially given how overvalued it was. Tesla won’t fail because of the first to market effect, but realistically it will probably go down to a about $78 dollars over the coming year. And then reach a price similar to Ford and GM in the next 10 years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 16:24:40'] Tesla is an auto manufacturer, I don’t think I would equate them to a Technology stock. I don’t think any of their other products add sufficient value to their revenue. Until they start to increase their non-automotive revenue they should be considered an auto manufacturer.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 19:31:11'] Tesla may very well be turning into the Apple of the 80s, early 90s. Still the most sexy product in the EV sector, enthusiasts love it but that Ford or Honda that's 30 percent cheaper is just as good. I can't see a plausible scenario where both the EV market grows exponentially and Tesla captures the majority of that business. Not unless Tesla competes aggressively at the entry-level market, which they say they would but aren't really.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 19:32:07'] I think competition is getting priced in. They definitely have a great product, but it rode atop Elon's brand, which is decidedly mixed. So other EVs coming from the luxury market and the mass markets are going to put pressure on Tesla on either end.  They'll grow, but their serviceable market will be harder to attain.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 17:35:24'] Tesla has been incredibly overvalued for years. It is probably headed to where a car company should be.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 16:11:33'] Definitely not betting against it, the price will almost certainly shrink with everything else due to M2 deflation. It is most likely the Apple of next generation tech stocks and is a market leader in that sector, the others tend to follow and I think they will this time too. People like to forget how weird and insane Steve Jobs was and nothing Musk is doing should really affect Tesla. Nothing's fundamentally changed to make Tesla not a ridiculously high growth unicorn company with hard manufacturing capacity.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 20:13:05'] Tesla now faces stiff competition and finds itself being pushed to the midmarket and not a premium brand due to bland design, poor build quality and general Muskdouchiness.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 20:13:45'] Tesla is a luxury good powered by cheap money and Elon’s ego. Both are deflating...
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 20:22:14'] tesla had a huge lead with EVs, but they squandered it by not having low prices, and by not innovating. In my opinion, they should have diluted significantly near the top to have a huge amount of cash for r&d and manufacturing capability, which could have given them some edge. They just don't know which way to go. It's just like elon musk's leadership, throw a whole bunch of things at the wall, and hope that something sticks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 23:44:20'] Where was it at pre-QE/stimmy, that's where it should be, maybe with a touch of inflation, not much. If daddy JPOW keeps that rate creepin' it should level out a cunt hair above where it used to be.  The above considering the operation runs somewhat successfully. The way Elon has been behaving, it really seems he is absent in many regards, distracted, and other such things. Could have some tough financials ahead considering.

At the time, they were worth more than the worlds top 12 automakers combined. Companies that sell 35 million vehicles a year and whose doors atleast align. Even today amidst the bloodbath, they are somehow still worth more than Exxon Mobil which is coming off their best couple of quarters in years. Johnson and Johnson. Half the consumer products in the home of every American are JnJ products. JP Morgan. Lol…Worth more than Coke and Pepsi combined. Tesla even today when it’s valuation has been more than halved, is ranked 8 in market cap, yet ranked 135 in terms of gross revenues.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 20:26:20'] What a meme.A lot of people in this thread are forgetting that they might not be the target audience. "It's too expensive for me". Okay. It's not too expensive for any of the companies I'm working with and they're frothing at the bit to get their hands on a bunch. It'll change the way they'll demo their products. It'll change the way they'll design the layouts of their systems inside of buildings. They tried it with the hololens and that kinda worked, but this is so much better already.People here seem to forget that Apple didn't use to focus on the consumer market at all, that kinda came when Jobs introduced the iPod. Before that, Apple was known for making expensive but quality business hardware and software with consumer products being less of a priority for most generations. And they kinda never really stopped. The Mac Pro is not meant for regular consumers (although I'm sure some got one). Let alone things like the Pro Display XDR that was memed on heavily for being an expensive display, but is considered by professionals one of the best displays in the field for its purpose and price.It's a useful skill to realize that if you're not the target audience for something, that doesn't mean there is none.

Most of the time I watch these things alone so it won’t be awkward for me to wear the Vision Pro. Not at all interested in the app/work features that Apple demonstrated. Pure entertainment is what I think this new device will be great at.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 03:20:57'] I still think the Meta quest is better product. It has a targeted audience of a younger generation that focuses on gaming and entertainment. The vision pro is very near but who is their intended audience ? Is it a movie entertainment device, is it a productivity machine, is it a memory capture device? I literally have no idea who the device is meant for or who will strap this thing on their head to record these in the moment memories.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:11:38'] This is a step for Apple, which is not their usual thing. This is a B2B product which will eventually lead to a B2C product that is smaller and cheaper.When that happens, you can expect Apple to explode with B2C AR/MX tech. This is just proof, that it isn't ready yet.Also, Meta is targeting VR more than AR/MX. AR/MX market is smartphone market size, VR is a niche tool for a niche market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:52:55'] This rollout reminds me somewhat of the first iPhone. At the time, it was expensive for a phone at $699 and did not come with a contract. It also had limited utility (no App Store, no picture messages), and ran on a slow network. But obviously over time, it was mass adopted and gained the features everyone wanted. Costs also came down via payment plans and 2 year contracts. I doubt sales will be terrific for the first gen Vision Pro, but this is a glimps into the future. There is room for both companeis to coexist and shine. People say no one needs a VR/AR headset, but those same people also said no one needs an iPhone in 2007. After all, we just need a phone that makes calls, right?

Look, I can see my fat ass just fine and waddle over to pick up my wife's old shirt \],and wipe my balls off with it, on either headset in 8k —  the black and white passthrough 'display' in the Quest 2 is far more superior at helping me suspend the belief of my sad reality after I popped though, vs vibrant color, so I think i'll keep it.  Have fun trying to pudd it with apps from Apple— it's a just a strap-on Ted Lasso and Jar Jar Binks cuck device.

Companies will likely be judged by how resilient to defend against unions and wage price spiral while motivating workers to work. Elon is great at engineering but his leadership will really make him to become a darling for global investor when economy recovery starts. Wouldn't be surprised someday powell might let himself slip when people ask him when he will pivot, he might grew impatient and say if more leaders are like elon in gov and biz, he can pivot much sooner!

Jan 2025 $60 CALL purchased for $70. 2 years for it to eclipse my $130 break even price seemed like an okay place to start the risk/reward entry.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 12:43:13'] Then Tesla will post it's quarterly delivery numbers, announce a share buyback and reverses the trend early next year. !remindme in one year. Internal battery production rapidly scaling up, cybertruck in production, a new plant in Mexico announced, and a preview of the compact Tesla/robotaxi are likely on the radar for 2023. Tesla likely won't meet their growth plans without a cheaper model after 2023.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 21:25:26'] I don’t understand how so many of the people in these comments aren’t speaking from a long term vision & viewpoint. Tesla changed the world and is changing it. It’s nothing like an electric BMW or Ford. This company has taken over the market in so many ways. Gas replaced with electricity that you actually have to pay for. Insurance. Etc.If you think it’s over for them, maybe you’re just way too cocky or angry about his Twitter commentary, lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 18:48:24'] It’s cheap as hell. If you’re smart you bought $106 to $107 tonight. It’s literally trading at a lower PE than Walmart rn. Way oversold. Monthly RSI at 16. It’s going to pump like crazy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 20:37:01'] It's hard to use valuations in the short term. My theory is Tesla will hit either pre COVID highs or lows and it'll mark the market bottom.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 10:58:34'] Tesla is supposed to be doubling sales every year. 4% growth is a miserable number for them.  Teslas margins were highest in the business. And supposed to improve as new factories and methods came online.  Instead they are getting lower as Elon cuts costs.  A new reality is going to have to start setting in for Tesla.  They are no longer an explosive growth company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 15:46:14'] It’s priced to perfection and far from it. See that pie chart where TSLA’ market cap is greater than all others? when it’s replaced with earnings the slide will stop
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 12:31:17'] I held TSLA stock for a decade until a month ago.   I’ll buy back in if / when it trades for 20x earnings.   It’s a long way from there.  And all the Elon fanboys talking about how it’s not a car company don’t convince me otherwise - they make and sell very expensive cars to affluent folk who, until recently, didn’t have many EV options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 13:49:42']  The stock has been doing basically nothing but green for a while.. why’d everyone forget about buy the rumour sell the news? If the stock was at 104 again this news would have pumped it
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 15:37:40'] Because the price too earnings multiple is still insanely off with it dropping so much.   The stock would have fall another 10 times to even get close to a 15 earnings.price ratio.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 16:39:49'] Well TSLA has been running on hype machine.  The legacy automakers are catching up and have more established network.  Add to it the man-child disparaged his core clientele, forced to lower prices to compete with legacy automakers to gain market share cutting the fat margins.  I'm curious to know how long it will survive as a standalone car company (unless man-child starts calling it as a tech company like the likes of UBER calls itself)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 05:08:54'] The market looks ahead 6-12 months. The price / news was already factor. There are headwinds, the economy is contracting. Tesla is already cutting prices to move inventory Car companies are cyclical. You buy when the economy is tanking and sell in euphoria.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 10:14:22']  Some traders may not like TSLA but it's my favorite stock on TTP dashboard while trading.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 07:46:15'] Cutting prices to win revenue is not the proper way to do business. Your margin becomes lower.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 16:46:17'] Tesla stock has doubled since the beginning of the year. Why do you think that is? Because they have been selling a boatload of cars beating even wall street expectations. So to answer your question, the stock did go up, just not when you thought it would.

Nothing noteworthy but capital allocation. Frankly as much as people like stability - you want a ceo/leader to shift along with the economic conditions making sound economic moves/plays.Any trader/gambler is freaking out - any investor should be calm/selling/buying once their prediction falls/rises at a certain price. How people should be investing?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 21:52:34'] He did not “break this vow before” regardless of how often the idiots in the media keep repeating this lie. There’s a huge difference between saying you’re not going to do something vs saying I’m not planning on doing something. In real life everyone knows that “not planning on it” means “I hope not, but maybe”. Here’s an example. Somebody asks me if I’m going to get Covid next year and I reply with “not planning on it”. If I do end up getting Covid the next year does it mean that I was lying? Obviously not.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 07:49:58'] Miss by a mile. Yesterday he said something in regards that even in recession Tesla is going strong. Seems like he has already started market manipulation and artificially inflating stock price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 07:58:37'] Continued rising defaults on auto loans, untamed inflation, rising unemployment, rising competition that provide cheaper EV options, China recession cutting into half of sales, U.S. recession cutting the other half, overleveraging Tesla stock to buy Twitter, and running out of headline making announcements to steer away from the facts. TLSA is on an express elevator to hell, going dowwwnnnnnnnn!!!!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 13:37:38'] Could it be that he is talking about Starlink in Ukrain?!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 13:51:11'] Thinking he is talking about Twitter
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:06:00'] They will probably miss but I’m not so sure. With the rise in gas prices, you would think more people would buy EVs right? But then again, inflation is hurting the middle class so people might not be able to afford a new big purchase
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 17:27:29'] Remember, all beats or misses are estimates from analysts guessing. It's actually irrelevant to beat or miss estimates. What matters is if the company is doing well or better than before if a growth stock.So much is put in beating a pointless estimate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:52:26'] Earnings are UP (a.k.a. Profitability is UP). That means P/E will be lower (which is good). Sales are down… so they are a victim of the ‘supply chain’ debacle… coming off of Covid lockdowns in China and 2 new production plants recently spooling up… I’m still Bullish on $TSLA

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:55:55'] He was on Joe Rogan (yeah I watched it once) and Joe was making fun of Twitter. And elons response was something like he loved the platform to get information out to everyone quickly but he worded it in a way where I immediately thought “he has a god complex.” So pretty sure this is what is happening.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 15:12:06'] He will literally let everyone down he’s done it multiple times.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:33:45'] Elon, welcome to the recession. It has been said that the more money you make and earn, the harder it becomes to maintain it. So, whether you fail, meet or exceed on Tesla earnings, you are still ahead in that you have a product that enables us to move further away from foreign oil manulipations and towards clean energy for the future. So, still a win, win. Kudos on keeping Starlink up. Peace out!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:36:40'] he talking to ye

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 14:52:25'] Here’s the thing, I hope it tanks. It helps with my strategy. But he could be setting underwhelming expectations so that if earnings are just slightly above expectations or just even, everyone will freak tf out

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 20:27:33'] Tesla just aligned himself as a Republican, which whatever it’s his choice the problem is now Tesla with be branded a Republican brand.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 05:36:59'] Disclaimer I hold Tesla shares.Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 36, forward P/E  at 21, PEG at .70 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).    It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).    It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.    Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).    All this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.And that's just the auto business.I am adding at these levels.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 16:49:05'] Forget earnings per share and P/E. Companies are really the present value of discounted future cash flows.This year, Tesla will post ~$10B free cash flow (up 100% from last year, 258% from 2 years ago, and 827% from 3 years ago). Now let’s do a simple and conservative 10 year discounted cash flow with the following assumptions:1.	⁠⁠⁠12% discount rate in the 10 year period2.	⁠⁠⁠8% terminal discount rate3.	⁠⁠⁠3% terminal growth rate inline with GDP growth, and less than half S&P 500 long term earnings growth rate.4.	⁠⁠⁠40% free cash flow growth in the first year that glides down linearly to 3% over the 10 years. This averages out to a compound annual growth rate of 23%, which is similar to Apple/Google over the 10 years after they first reached ~$10b FCF.The result of such a DCF is a present value of $190 per share with quite conservative assumptions. There is plenty of upside: increase the growth rate in the 10 year period or the terminal period, decrease the discount rate to be more inline with S&P 500 returns, and you can make bull cases several times higher than today’s Tesla price.

Tesla is a low quality car, their service lousy, and Teslas marketshare/ sales are falling.  I would value it at 15 USD pr share, which is a PE equal to Mercedes; about 5x earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 00:12:14'] Probably in the same very misleading way as in 2021...In filings he donates the shares, but there are no listed recipients. No major charities report receiving donations from 'Elon Musk.' Digging deeper one will find that the "charitable donation" is to his own Musk Foundation. As far as we know, the Foundation does not exist to _do charitable work_ it exists to _fund charitable causes_ that then do the actual work. It also funds research and grants among other things, but for this discussion we are focusing on "charity" because that is what the headlines claim. Of course it will be pointed out that this is how all rich people arrange their charitable giving...and that is fine, if those foundations are actually then passing those funds on to actual charities. Last year, after his widely publicized _"charitable donation"_ of $5.7b, the Musk Foundation was valued at approximately $9.4b. Of that amount, approx $160m was donated to _actual charitable causes_. This represented approximately 1.7% of the Musk Foundation assets. A more informative and accurate headline would read...One of the worlds richest billionaires gives only a minuscule percentage of his net worth to charitable causes.My Mom gives a higher percentage of her net worth to charity than he does.

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-04 19:50:14'] But…but…Reddit said meany head Elon was going down?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-04 16:13:45'] Lol how much did the jury make on that one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-04 04:55:37'] I guess stock manipulation is perfectly legal now, if you have a team of lawyers. Y’all remember that HUGE Russian hack in December 2020? Where many many governments & corporation secrets where stolen. That hack was obviously coordinated with China/Russia. And China is now giving that stolen IP to Elon to break into various sectors of the US market. There’s nothing genius about Elon, except he’s willing to betray the US. The betrayal likely started in 2018 when China awarded him the 1st “independently owned” factory in China owned by a foreigner. You think he got this special status factory because the CCP loves him? You don’t get to do business in China without being required to partner with a Chinese company OR the Chinese GOVERNMENT. Elon is not a genius, he’s a rich kid with a engineering & marketing degree. He’s been buying ads & paying influencers to market himself as a genius. Is all smoke & mirrors. The stupid purchase of Twitter was not his choice. He was ordered by Xi to own it or destroy it in the process, because China saw Twitter as a threat. Also, Elon is not the only person that China is giving stolen IP to. There are many others. I also suspect China gave stolen IP to OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which Elon & Peter Thiel are investors. There are way too many coincidences & it’s becoming clear to me that Russia/China have been using stolen IP in plain sight. But the thing is, every major government is aware of this. That’s why Russia is so dependent on China. India has been buying Russian oil at a discount too, but the jury is still out if the people of India will be a Chinese puppet & do China’s bidding. In the meantime we will all act stupid like we don’t know what’s really going on because we need China to cooperate in lowering green house emissions. But that doesn’t mean we can’t keep the best chips out of Chinas hands by coordinating with major chip makers. Europe has recently agreed to keep cutting-edge chip factory equipment out of China. China is screwed. The longer they take to make a FAIR trade deal, the worse it’s going to be for them in the long run, because the world will find new supply chains outside of China & Russia. For example the Biden administration has already partnered with northern Africa to supply Europe with natural gas. Taiwan & S Korea are making chip factories in the US to be completed in 2025. The sad thing is, there are a large number of US voters that have fallen for crazy Qanon conspiracies spread by Russia & China. Promoting Trump as some messiah, very similar to Elon. The Republican Party knows this & instead of splitting the party are acting stupid & hoping Trump dies soon. The Dems can’t do anything about it because anything they say is always label fake news. And frankly Trump or any extreme GOP candidate getting the nomination is good news for Dems but dangerous for democracy. As we saw in the midterms, the US voters are tired of the extremist Republican Party, but the GOP doesn’t seem to care what voters want. I have no loyalty to the Dems but Biden had done a great job against China/Russia & the Republican Party has a long way to go before it can get me to support them. It’s looking like splitting the party is the only way out of this mess. A short term loss, but a HUGE win in the long run.  I welcome any comment on my analysis. Btw, Peter Thiel is a major investor in Reddit. Peter Thiel, who went on a tour promoting Bitcoin in 2022, while his firm SOLD $1.8 BILLION of their Bitcoin as he was pumping it. Bitcoin was always a Chinese weapon against the US dollar. The world is in a permanent state of cyberwar. People are just oblivious to that fact, & are too addicted to their phone to do anything about how negatively it’s affecting their mental health. The best thing one can do is probably delete the Twitter & Facebook app from your phone IMHO. I did it & have no regrets. These are many alternatives to wean off the addiction to social media. https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/18/peter-thiels-founders-fund-sold-crypto-just-before-markets-soured/

POST_TEXT: b"Isn't $15K a lot of money for a product that doesn't really achieve what it says it does. It is risky to drive in FSD mode, you still have to be super alert etc.\n\nWhy are so many drivers buying it? What am I missing? Is this 100% profit margin for Tesla? And if this is such a good business model?\n\nMy estimate is that most drivers paying $2K today will stop doing so in the current year when they realize that they aren't going to get FSD and it isn't worth the money. That could lead to a significant hit to the Tesla profits. Will the recent NHTSA ruling to recall the software and do an update provide any indication of tough times ahead?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:52:47'] Paying $15k for a half baked product with no definitive full implementation date = 🥴What a scam….especially since the hardware is already on the car. Now…if Tesla wanted to make it a subscription you could do for say an extra $20-50 a month…I could be ok with that. Especially once it’s fully ready. And if you could subscribe and easily cancel it. Say you’re going on a long road trip where self driving would come in handy. You could just pay for the FSD feature for that month.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 00:41:02'] You only have to be super alert in city blocks and weird intersections. In highways, it is practically flawless. It's $15k for the lifetime of the vehicle. I don't know where you are getting the per year amount. Please do the appropriate basic research next time.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOcSEX-8rTg&ab\_channel=VehicleVirgins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOcSEX-8rTg&ab_channel=VehicleVirgins)Go watch the video above. It's not perfect, obviously, but if it can shave 80% of your driving for you and you're someone who commutes every day, if you own that vehicle for 8 years, it would only cost you around $2k per year. Other companies can't charge you for it because they have geofenced technology. Meaning, companies like Waymo and other self-driving technology only work for a certain area (a small town here or there in various areas). Tesla FSD is designed to work everywhere. Again, yes, it's still got ways to go but please look at the data. &#x200B;[https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport#:\~:text=Q1%202019-,In%20the%201st%20quarter%2C%20we%20recorded%20one%20crash%20for%20every,every%201.24%20million%20miles%20driven](https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport#:~:text=Q1%202019-,In%20the%201st%20quarter%2C%20we%20recorded%20one%20crash%20for%20every,every%201.24%20million%20miles%20driven).Tesla FSD+AP has fewer accidents than a Tesla vehicle that isn't using FSD+AP. In fact, it has 8x fewer accidents than your average person driving a vehicle. It's high margins because it's mainly an operating cost concern involving data centers and employees working on FSD. The gross cost to add FSD is slim depending on how much you want to add the value based on the cameras and hardware they have already with the vehicle. High operating leverage = more profit when scaled.I'll tell you right now: Any company that solves full-self driving capabilities will instantaneously become the most valuable company in the world. That is why FSD is intriguing. The ability to get from point A to point B without having to control the steering is priceless. $15k is a bargain if Tesla is able to achieve that. Currently, yes, I wouldn't pay $15k because I rarely drive here in NYC with my Tesla and because with the way I drive, I probably wouldn't have access to FSD (you need to reach a certain safety score to have access to FSD. This is how Tesla prevents, to the best of their ability, reckless drivers). The application of this is also in semi-trucks. That's a huge aspect of this you are missing. Companies operating semi-trucks will pay hundreds of thousands for this type of technology per truck, EASILY. My guess is it will be around 2030-early 2030 when FSD becomes fully operational as intended. As of now, people are paying for it because it's mostly wealthier people who can afford it and also, if your driving route includes a highway with lots of traffic during peak time, it's only $2k per year (assuming you keep your vehicle for 8 years). Not exactly a huge cost.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 17:40:29'] Fsd is a very small business currently. They have low single digit take rates in china and europe. In the US it’s low teens. On the order of 100 mil a quarter of revenue? So like 2%. Also, it’s not 100% margin, you need the computer for running the models on the car, sensors, development cost, model training. It’s likely low margins in reality. Confused by what you mean by most drivers paying 15k today will stop doing so in the current year? It’s a one time payment, not recurring.The nhtsa ruling is a nothing burger, tesla already has a patch in the upcoming version.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 17:29:58'] It gets better every update it receives, if it was bad and didn’t work people wouldn’t buy it. One doesn’t have to look very far on YouTube to see it doing very impressive things,however it’s still not perfect but so far there are people who use it everyday to go to work and back without any takeovers so to say it doesn’t work is a little misleading.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:36:22'] You got a point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 13:36:20'] What happens if FSD continues to improve? ChatGPT just took the world by storm .. and came out of nowhere. FSD is using the same underlying technology, neural networks, that was used to program ChatGPT. The improvement curve on these types of products is very different than that of more traditional programming. I'd be very careful in discounting what Tesla has achieved with their neural networks, especially when you watch videos of FSD in action and how nascent the entire effort is.

Despite the fact we were always in the green and turning a profit. It showed me to ignore the loudest of raving mobs in the stock market (which can also be used in other aspects of life), because they're often wrong.  With my employee options I was getting shares as low as $40 a piece, at their peak they were worth $120+ and I *still* consistently get dividends from them. Shit talking my stocks ended up letting me by them on double plus discount.

He was very vocal about what he wanted to do. Also if a bank were to cross him that would ruin a relationship that has all the indicators of being very valuable moving forward. The only people that don’t believe this already don’t like Elon and are looking for confirmation bias against him. Money doesn’t have emotions or political affiliation.Edit: also this is just collateral even if true. That means if he doesn’t turn it around. Which if you get on Twitter, I think you’ll see lots of people sporting Twitter Blue.

The actual truth will be millions ( and I do mean millions) will start becoming sick everyday, with who knows how many deaths, and productivity will fall off a cliff while people take care of themselves since the government will not. The lockdown worked because they closed the number of interactive sick people.

I mean considering the company has to maintain 50% growth to maintain this valuation, it would be reckless not to think about what happens if externalities force a slow down. Right OP?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 07:07:08'] Well there’s Tesla the company which is pretty good and there’s Tesla that stock which is overpriced and it’s priced as if Tesla is the biggest car company in the world in terms of production and dominates all competitors. Competitors are getting better and better and their EVs are getting better every year. Too much competition for its current price. We have two EVs none are Tesla. Our next EV will be a Polestar maybe.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 04:51:10'] Just from personal experience- actual vegetarians are not to hyped about Beyond Meat, and the few places I’ve seen that have the meat substitute option grill it on the same grills they grill meat on- which is a dealbreaker. As a non vegetarian when I’ve tried it- it tastes like meat in only that it tastes very greasy and overly smokey. It doesn’t taste at all like a healthy substitute. Actual soy/mushroom/etc based veggie burgers taste way better then whatever chemical concoction BM is.————For a more businessy critique- they don’t understand their target market. There are better and cheaper established products in this area, and the product doesn’t succeed very well in winning over converts.  Conclusion- it’s a good idea in theory, but in practice it’s a poor fit for most market demographics they are hoping to appeal to
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 09:28:46'] While I abhor Musk, this is ridiculous. Tesla is Us based company with a large factory in China. They have 2 factories in US making cars !!!!!I agree on Carvana. i dont see that company surviving in this environment. But Beyond Meat should be ok. They have and will continue to reduce their Opex to reduce cash burn. I think with global food shortage, lab grown meat is not going away for sure. Worst case I could see someone like Gates taking it private and expand to countries which are desperately short of food.

The fed is going to raise rates again in a few days, & my guess is the rate hike will be higher than what people think & it’s going to hurt Elon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 15:59:01'] $7500 tax credit moved forward, which has already drawn down existing inventory in the US.Furthermore, Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 40, forward P/E  at 23, PEG at .78 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).    It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).    It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.    Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).    All this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 13:40:42'] Lots of investors and die hard fans thought that TSLA's lead in the EV space was too far from its dinosaur competitors. Now that the gap has diminished, the focus is on profitability per vehicle. Goal post and focus will continue to move.Elon loves the attention and can finally act like himself after picking up the playbook from Donny. The stock will recover a bit in the near term, but I think it will come back to Earth from the orbit it's in. You really get to see now who the "hardcore" Elon fan boys are now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 17:01:05'] He will be Steve Jobs kinda ousted and Tesla will be fine. Twitter is done for tho. Musk will run to SpaceX and pick his ego up off the floor
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 18:50:58'] Elon fkd up when he decided to go behind ukraines back (and NATO) and try to negotiate a voting referendum for peace.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 07:39:54'] My friend who has a Tesla says he’s tired of people asking him about Elon. If you own a Tesla, people don’t want to discuss the car when the ceo is going batshit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 14:50:51'] Tesla had first mover advantage and despite initial scaling issues, looked like it was going to dominate and beat Detroit at its own game. Except it's led by a moron who figured out a way to kill the golden goose. What they needed was a Tim Cook or a Satay Nadella, someone steady and no drama. Now Tesla has no plans to provide true full self driving for many years, despite what Melon head says, has raised prices while losing incentives, and has to increasingly compete for supply chain materials with big auto, across the world. Their ability to scale is shoddy, and products such as their truck and commercial vehicles are years away.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 09:01:32'] I don't own a Tesla or the stock but the loss of his fan base has primarily been a political backlash from the left.  Liberals bought Teslas thinking they were saving the planet only to find out that Elon doesn't stand with them politically, so now they throw a tantrum, quit Twitter and think they'll ruin his life by bashing the very car they thought was saving the planet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 08:05:17'] anyone that does not want their Tesla, I will take it and drive it happily. What Elon is doing affects us in a positive way every day. Internet, cars, free speech, equality, and the future is very bright with his technology.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 16:49:19'] It's probably just bots attacking Elon because they know their days are numbered.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 01:05:53'] A few leftist fascists who are pro-censorship, are merely upset that balance is now being restored to Twitter. A place that was completely corrupt before Elon bought the company. Elon has done more to fix Twitter in the short time that he's owned it, than what Twitter itself had done during their entire existence.So these anti-American, anti-free speech and pro fascist leftists do what they do best when they are upset. They virtue signal and endlessly whine about how Elon Musk is evil all of a sudden. Nothing will come from all of their whining. They might as well shout at the sky, and some of them have probably already done that too. A significant portion of them are freaks with severe mental problems. I'm with Elon, because Elon is doing the right thing. I'm not with the whiny little leftists who are upset that their little party has now been broken up.Keep on virtue signaling. It'll get you real far.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 05:48:03'] Elon is an idiot. I mean, clearly he's got some smarts cuz he's figured this much out but he's on a dark path. Who does he think gave him the Billions in subsidies? Obama and Dems, cuz republicans sure didn't do that. Who does he think buys his cars? The republicans supporting the oil industry? No, they're constantly beating down and rejecting federal go green initiatives all over the board. He's making an enemy of the very people who will provide the most for his number one business. Twitter isn't going to make him the richest man in the world that for sure. In fact, it will likely do the opposite even if you exclude the amount of financial resources as he continues to be even more bold with the things he says. Example: this idiot literally told everyone to vote for republicans in house because we have a dem president. If that happens rip mf they're going to cockblock everything you plan to just because it's anti oil.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 08:14:49'] yeah this chart isnt including a lot of the accumulation phase which started in 2016... media pump really started in 2019... so were still in the mist of a sell off and there wont be a correction just yet back to the mean... stock is still floating at a astronomically high valuation relative to the rest of the market... dont be fooled by the chart people post online... a 50% drop from current pricing is still possible and most likely probable... were just in a DCA rally for people who bought high and short term technical traders... but this will be short lived... tesla may fall back to being unprofitable with the recent price cuts, inventory surplus building and recession looming

BYD does a lot more than just cheap cars, they also have the lions share of government contracts for buses, ect… For those you don’t know, it’s almost impossible to buy a car in China that is not electric, and something like 70% of all cars in China are electric now.

Currently ramping two factories = over 2 million in annual run rate, upgrading current factories, new mega pack factory able to more than triple their current run rate, and looking for a location for another giga factory. This growth will continue, even with a major recession tesla has and will generate enough cash to continue this expansion.You can make this argument for any growth stock, maybe pay more attention to AMZN with a pe of 100 and peg of 5 and a growth rate nowhere close to tesla.

Experienced Software Engineers & AI Folks have so many options right now it's silly, why would they bow down to Tesla. Culturally, you are attracting specific types of people (esp. tech folks) who would be willing to come into an office everyday. Do you know how many brilliant people there are out there you just cut out who simply want more flexibility?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 02:53:05'] reminder that Elon Musk forced Tesla employees in China to sleep on the factory floor during the pandemic so the company wouldn’t have to temporarily shut down. So when he says shit like this, what he really means is “I’m mad I can’t run a plantation”

If it can bring in like at least $3-4k per month driving by itself, fuck yeah I'm getting FSD. I honestly think that all Tesla cars driving people around can be done through automation and stuff. We really don't need humans doing this job. Imagine your car be paid off by having it drive around automatically, making passive income, and you do something else with your time. But people accepting the fact they're being driven around in driver-less cars will definitely take time to get use to. Isn't that one of the goals of FSD as well? I mean real humans driving Taxis or Ubers will be obsolete in the future if passive income can pay off their car.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-28 05:48:55'] In America at 5 dollar a gallon a 20 mpg car costs 25 cents per mile.   Electricity would have to be 1 dollar a MW to be the same cost per mile.   Currently it's 10 to 20 cents, so a 5x or 10x increase for parity.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-28 04:51:20'] I’ll give my two cents. I think it’s gonna get dark for a while, quite literally. We’re expecting blackouts in large parts of Europe this winther, and OTC market for Q1 next year in Europe is trading crazy high. Power prices will undoubtely increase a lot which will affect the demand for electric vehicles (imo). On the other hand, oil prices will most likely still be high by next year and EVs will surely still be vastly cheaper to own than traditional cars with combustion engines. Personally though, I expect entire markets to go down as a result of a huge imbalance in production of power relative to demand. I’m no expert at all but I work as a power trader with people who are way smarter than me, so I’m basing my comment off of their statements

Here in the states they have had to force rolling blackouts in different states as well as cities. I do not think some states are ready. Let alone California, the pioneer in “All Electric sales/vehicles only by 2035” good luck with that. Maybe they should figure out where their energy and water is coming from for all their fancy shmancy ideas. I’m from WA however I know California gets their “needs” from every other state within 2-3 around them. I do believe in going electric/green, however it needs to be done responsibly. Don’t start with solar either, while I agree CA gets a lot of sun, CO gets more sunny days than any other state. All I’m saying is, slow down, get it right, so we can all get behind it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 18:05:39'] Your opinion is your opinion- and that's perfectly acceptable. But in the end, markets are efficient and TSLA is priced at *exactly* what it is worth at this exact point in time based on future opportunity, growth, and cash flows.BTW, I don't own any TSLA stock and am not much a fan of their cars (too cheaply made IMHO).

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-13 22:10:10'] Something is wrong with your Discounted cash flow model if you’re assessing the present value of all future cash flows at $140 a share on the high end. Even if they never make a penny from the robot, robotaxis, energy, licensing, and all the other ancillary opportunities I’m coming up with $850 on the conservative LOW end in 5 years just as a simple car company.Add in all the other wacky crap and my middle “realistic” 5 year target is closer to $1500. High end is something like $3500 for 5 years and $15,000 in 10 years. Granted this would mean robotaxis dominate transportation, Optimus disrupts factory labor and all but replaces most minimum wage jobs, and 10%+ of new construction homes use solar roofs, but it’s a high end estimate for a reason.Curious how you arrived at your number.. it would require that their current growth grinds to a halt, they never release cyber truck/semi/$25k car , and their margins never improve or even get worse. Not to mention failing to bring to market all the other wacky crap their working on

Tesla is removing hardware sensors left and right, charging horrendous prices for software features. The cars themselves are not to my liking, but I don’t want to argue about that. There is one fact I’d like to mention.  Think about how much Tesla shares are used as collateral. If the share price drops further, we might see an epic sell off. I’m betting it will cascade down horribly,  but … I don’t touch anything related to it. No shares, options, bonds … I honestly don’t care.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 15:45:05'] So many comments here don’t understand what ESG is the the methodology used to develop the score and annual list. Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance aka ESG. Three prongs taken at equal weights. Most companies can get an easy score on the Social aspect but not always, same with Governance. Environment is different because the way it’s calculated is kind of antiquated. There’s really two main parts to a company’s score, the company’s own response to S&P to about 100 or so questions and 500-1000 data points collected. Then take into account that S&P regularly changes the methodology for calculation as well. Some companies know how to answer the questions better than some, which is why they stay on the list. I’m not saying that’s Tesla’s issues, just pointing it out. We all know the oil and gas industry has some powerhouse PR as proven every time the have an oil spill. The data points include things like social and environmental campaigns run by the companies. Like when Exxon says they’re developing cleaner technologies to drill oil, we all know that it can never be clean but it’s “cleaner” (take that with a big grain of salt) so they get good marks for it. We all know it’s BS but we turn a blind eye because we need gas. I read Tesla had racial bias and sexual harassment claims, all companies do, but being a tech company in the Bay Area will generally lead to more than one in Houston. Not that Tesla has more, but from my wife and MIL’s years in HR, people at tech companies feel more empowered to report compared to companies run by and with the “good ol boy” culture. There’s actually a big push in the oil & gas industry to change that, same for my industry - Supply chain & Logistics. Saying all that to say, this isn’t blow back against Elon for the twitter deal or crap like that, these were calculated weeks/months ago.Edit: if you want to know more than some click bait articles you can read up about it here: [S&P methodolgy](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/products-benefits/products/esg-evaluation)

The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.\n\nWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC, the company said in a press release.\n\nThe cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter.

He doesn't need BILLIONS for child support. **Most obvious need for this money is to eliminate the loans he has against Tesla stock**. He took out loans against Tesla in order to buy Twitter. With this cash, he can reduce/eliminate those loans. That's a good thing for him and Tesla investors. You don't want tens of millions of shares to be on collateral. Obviously I could be wrong. Maybe he wants to buy a company. Maybe he wants it for personal use (I doubt it). But I think eliminating the loan is the most obvious. That, or maybe some of the investors dropped out and he needs to replace their investment in Twitter.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:47:48'] Best advice I could give you is to not beat yourself up too much. Everyone gets carried away with the market at some point.If I was you, and I wasn't trading on borrowed money, I would take the hit on the chin and accept that you fucked up but it cant really get much worse than it is at present. Hell, some of the stocks are at levels that could be pretty good buy points. But some also aren't. I would just stop looking at them for a couple of months.Use the break to invest in yourself. Learn some basic TA, which can help you to not step on so many landmines. Look at a simple Bollinger band. 20 period. If the monthly close price isn't above the center line and the line isn't trending up then the stock isn't something you should be investing in. Simple momentum. There's plenty of other TA if you want to get a bit trickier. Just remember to KISS. And don't take advice on individual stocks from anyone. How do you know they aren't looking to unload their stocks onto you....  Best of luck.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 13:24:21'] Op, a lot of the haters seem to have extremely short memories. Before the pandemic, a number of these stocks were great medium to long term performers while Tesla’s balance sheet issues were sufficient enough to cause people to cast doubt on its future as a public company. You have 2 major issues. One is understanding why you own certain names. For example, relative to 2020-21 when nearly everyone was wfh, will there be more usage of zoom’s core product in 2023? How can online dating grow on top of pandemic numbers as people continue to go out in person? The second issue is duplication. There’s no reason to own tsm and intc, bmbl and mtch, cloudflare and crowdstrike, etc at the same time. Pick one and keep it moving. Imo some of these names will come back in 5 years. Others won’t. Therefore do a whittling down process to eliminate duplication, get rid of 1/2-2/3 of the portfolio, and keep ko and tsla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:11:55'] I'd say sell most of your losers and put that into ETFs for diversification purposes. Your portfolio is very tech heavy and by the looks of it chosen by if things are trendy or not at the time. Example: Zoom, which was worth more than 490 in October 2020 due to the pandemic. Dollar-cost averaging that to a lower cost basis is going to take ages with little certainty for the future or reward. If you really want to pick individual stocks some tips: check if companies actually make money, check if they are in a hype bubble (like AI now the new big thing is, but Blockchain had that spot a few years ago), and switch up your choices of industry. Or just yolo it all on 0DTE option gambles and become a prized member of the WSB wall of shame.Also do your own research and don't follow what Reddit says too much.

When that happens their profitability and vaunted gross margin will come back to what everyone else's is.  Also they are selling a car designed in 2012 with only modest internal updates since then.   That is going to get old as new and shinier EVs come out.  I already see it in my local CC parking lot.

POST_TEXT: b' Tesla lost over $140 million betting on Bitcoin last year, according to a Monday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The electric car manufacturer took a $204 million impairment charge while gaining $64 million through converting Bitcoin in 2022.\n\n In the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $204 million of impairment losses resulting from changes to the carrying value of our Bitcoin and gains of $64 million on certain conversions of bitcoin into fiat currency by us, Tesla said in the filing.\n\n An impairment charge describes a reduction or loss in the value of an asset. It can occur because of a change in economic circumstances, like the crypto winter that gripped the market after the collapse of Terra Luna in May 2022.\n\n The annual disclosure to the SEC comes less than a week after Teslas quarterly earnings report, which included no Bitcoin transactions but nonetheless saw the value of its holdings decline, generating a $43 million loss for the last four '

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 11:47:30'] The pre pandemic high is your reference point for almost all tech stocks. That number for Tesla is around 65-70. The fundamental reason why Tesla is sinking is because in a recession people will not buy 50-100K "luxury" cars. Second, auto financing rates are up significantly, which pinches borrowers. Lastly, investors are paying up for sales growth. And guess what, in a Fed induced recession, there is no growth.Their valuation is 100% built on future sales growth.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla surpassed Wall Street expectations in highly-anticipated fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, bolstered by record delivery of electric vehicles during the last three months of 2022.\n\nThe electric car company posted $24.3bn in revenue, slightly higher than the $24.07bn anticipated by analysts and 33% growth year-over-year, demonstrating that the automaker may be doing a better job than anticipated of weathering concerns about slipping demand for its cars, logistical holdups and ongoing legal drama surrounding its chief executive, Elon Musk.\n\nTo address a backslide in demand, Tesla has been slashing prices on its electric cars by up to 30%, bringing the price of its best-selling Model Y vehicle down to $52,990  a drop of $13,000. The move fueled a record 405,278 vehicles sold to customers in the fourth quarter, even as the company missed its 50% annual growth target.\n\nDemand so far year-to-date is strongest in our history, Musk said in a call with investors on Wednesday.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 10:32:15'] Why is nobody talking about the clear reason they made this cut? It’s to capture the EV tax credit that went into affect the first of the year. Now the model 3 starts at 37.5k essentially. This is what consumers have been waiting for.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 07:35:18'] All depends how their margins and sales look next few quarters. If this boosts sales and doesn’t eat in too deeply to profits it was an excellent move. But if it doesn’t sell more cars then this could really hurt them
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 08:20:59'] This is typical supply and demand. Other manufacturers do stuff like this but by offering dealer incentives and less transparent discounts. The optics certainly aren't good and I don't know how much it does to stir up demand but sounds like they had to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 10:44:41'] A man told me he walked into a car show room on New Year eve.  He told the lone manager his daughter is looking for a new car. The unhappy new car manager says how much you got?  He said not much just $3500 cash.  The manager says you give me the money now I will sell it to you. How? I need to sell another car by mid night.Same message to Tesla dealership.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 16:10:35'] It’s just dynamic pricing. He tried to fuck everyone when the supply/demand dynamics were in his favor. And now they’re not and he is indiscriminately lowering prices. And yes I think Musk 100% sets the prices. They always tend to reflect his mood and are too round not to fit his egomaniac personality. I think it’s a terrible method for long term customer satisfaction. It reeks of desperation and insecurity about long term prospects. Price integrity of the vehicle was a huge selling point for Tesla. That’s over now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 10:40:40'] It needs to sell. Inventory carrying cost is too high.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 03:24:38'] Surprisingly few comments reference the markups at traditional dealers that have been typical for the last year.  Those markups are starting to go away at all of those dealers as inventory ticks up.This is just direct evidence that Tesla was able to capture all of those extra profits.  Doesn’t make them worth as much as their stock price, but I don’t understand all of the doom and gloom.  For 12 months they got to make a ton of additional profit that was going to dealers for all of the other manufacturers.

POST: ['2023-01-25 14:57:55'] POST TITLE: b"Tesla's 2022 Q4 Results"
POST_TEXT: b"Here's a quick take on Tesla's Q4 results. $81.5B is the FY2022 revenue, a growth of 51.4% year over year from FY2021. The gross margin increased for the year from 25.3% to 26.2%. Net income increased 128% from $5.5B to $12.5B. Expect EBITDA to be at least $17.6B this year, an increase of 9% or so from FY2021.\n\nGiven these results, the valuations are as follows: the invested capital of Tesla is 5.1x LTM or FY2022 revenue -- remember, this multiple includes Tesla's huge cash balance of over $21b. The EBITDA multiple is about 25x while the earnings multiple (over market cap) is around 30.0x. Based on 2023E results, the earnings multiple should be around 26.0x. In other words, they're coming down like many growth companies that turn the corner and report positive earnings. Tesla was EBITDA positive starting in 2016 and earnings positive starting in 2020. The revenue growth year over year is 51.4% from FY2022. Plus these multiples would be somewhat lower if you took out the cash Tesla has:"

Yes, Tesla has other tentacles, but none of them make money the way their cars currently do.We're headed for a downturn in the economy. You can call it a recession, stagflation, disinflation, whatever...The truth is, money is not as easy to get as it was before.Interest rates will be higher for longer. It may 5%, 5.5%, 6%, or 8%+ by the time the Fed is satisfied. Nobody knows. These rates will put pressure on everyone's bank account. As this pressure expands, buying cars won't be a priority for most people.There are auto manufacturers launching new EVs for sale in 2023 and 2024. Tesla has a lead because they were the only game in town. As more choices become available, this lead will dwindle, not expand.Elon is a risk to Tesla stock. At any moment, a bad tweet, a lawsuit, a selling of shares, etc. will tank the stock. Tesla stock moves as Elon moves.Zoom out folks. Just because its had a nice run up (I've profited from it myself) doesn't mean now is the time to FOMO in. The stock still has a lot of room to move up or down. Problem is, no one really know where it will be in the upcoming months.Place your bets wisely.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-05 11:15:14'] I used to work at GS and worked on the first TSLA stock split. Historically, stock splits have done absolutely nothing to volume or price action. TSLA is obviously a very unique stock and has more retail participation than a lot of them. But we did about 100 analyses to try to explain the rally after the first split to the TSLA board and historically, there was no data to support the "makes it easier for retail to participate" point. And you would think there is even less of a chance this is true now with fractional shares. However, it does get the stock back into headlines, which can bring retail interest as people speculate whether it will lift the stock.

But Probably not that. Elon burned the shorts.  He got into the SP500. It's yet to be seen what Tesla can do without electric car subsidies.  The problem with Teslanomics is eventually you run out of Other People's money.Edit- It's yet to be seen what Tesla will do once a Commercial Wholesale Battery is available to competitors in the marketplace. Lots of companies make way better, more solid vehicles than Tesla. It doesn't have to be a "better" battery.  It can be ...80% as good and 10 grand less and in a nicer build quality or whatever competitive attributes.  To really put a big dent in Tesla's market share of "battery powered" vehicles.And that will happen.  They didn't invent the wheel.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 07:23:16'] I have them as an 'AVOID'.  With inflation continuing to roll on, new taxes being imposed on Americans, electrical grid problems (California told EV drivers to drive less) and unemployment rising, paying a ridiculous amount for an electric vehicle will fade.  I don't believe the rebates will have that big effect on purchases.  Plus, there is the Elon Musk factor.  A bit of a loose cannon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 07:02:14'] TSLA is so unpredictable with Elon’s antics. I’m long for sure, and I like Elon a lot, but he’s making it a more risky investment than it’s been in years. I wish he’d focus less on TWTR and more on TSLA, and the shareholders. But, I think it’s valuation is pretty fair at these levels, and don’t see it depreciating much further.

POST_TEXT: b'For years, only one customer mattered in the market for lithium and other metals used in electric vehicle batteries: **Tesla Inc.**  The prospect that a new mine might end up feeding Elon Musks automaker was enough to sway cautious lenders to finance a project or convince investors that untested operations had a shot at meeting aggressive sales projections. And as the biggest buyer in a sector full of startup miners, **Tesla wielded unusual power to dictate terms, typically locking in agreements for supplies for years at fixed prices.**\n\nAn aggressive push into electric vehicles by legacy car manufacturers, and worries over tight markets for lithium and other key materials such as nickel and graphite, is upending those dynamics. **Ford Motor Co. and GM have roiled the industry by striking generous pacts with prospective suppliers that include commitments to pay upfront for future deliveries or offer cheap loans to build new mines.**\n\n**Tesla, by contrast, has resisted partnering with '

POST_TEXT: b'Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the companys share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?\n\nOne bright spot has been the companys increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivians future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 13:16:02'] My take: the interest rates went way up, making most investors way more conservative. They were in for the momentum not the products. Simultaneously the EV market by now has way more players, including the ones who have been making cars for a 100 years. The low hanging fruit are gone, and despite what Tesla told people, they're not in software they're in automotive. Looking at any kind of lists of who sells most EVs, I don't see Rivian on them.But you know, you never know..? Something for that risky part of your portfolio? In any case, I think that's why the momentum is gone at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 17:58:11'] Another thing to note that will hurt their stock price in the short term is that they are being removed from the Nasdaq 100 index. Rivian is a long term play, like decades. The EV moat is shrinking so they need to ramp that volume and hit their targets consistently in the near term. Supply chain woes have eased so they need to get cash burn under control. If that happens, then investors will return. Hell, if Lucid is still attracting investors then Rivian can get by for now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 14:40:52'] The fact they are actually selling a significant amount of vehicles is the first step to a successful company.  The fact they were briefly valued about 100x their actual value by the market at one point isn't Rivian's fault.  If their run rate continues at only the same amount of sakes as their most recent quarter, they are trading at about 5.3 times their sales.Their profitability may be held back by accounting tricks rather than actual cash burn... How much is depreciation annually on new factories, btw?  How much are they paying in stock options that count against the balance sheet but don't actually cost money?  I haven't researched them, but they are finally making progress.  Rivian's market cap may not be particularly overheated at this point.I saw one in Syracuse NY yesterday, my first sighting of a Rivian vehicle other than their website. Syracuse is not a hotbed of electric vehicles.Their sales are 2.9% of Tesla's, their market cap is 1.9% of Tesla's... Other than Tesla fanboys buying stock because reasons, why is Tesla's valuation so much higher? If they correct and meet in the middle, Rivian will be worth 25% more than it's worth right now, with no material improvement in execution.  Rivian seems to be headed in the right direction.I'm thinking about buying in...

Now where are all those people that were shouting me down in December after I said competition was heating up (BMW, Audi, Toyota) and margins will collapse as telsa needed to move to a more targeted segment strategy otherwise they will become irrelevant? Sounds to me like a 20% reduction is panic stations now to chase tax credits. They will try to go for volume over profits. Volumes will increase but they will lose their mystique and annoy recent buyers. I think they will become a small segment producer now. The only real benefit they have is no legacy pension costs. Apart from that, they are in trouble. Chasing price and tax credits with the competition out there these days is going into a fight they have no experience.Self driving still does not work 100%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 11:49:00'] Elon is being cringe greedy but master playing the meme stock game! Follow along if you want a lesson on the power of greed and wealth. He knew Twitter stock would rise and Tesla drop today. Today was the date waiting period to acquire Twitter ended, a natural time for this Tesla dip. He triggered further dip on Tesla stock with this announcement today. The sell off started today. He wanted Tesla stock drop, so he can swoop in and buy more Tesla stocks. (He currently only owns 17%.) Which is what he really is betting big on. I’d almost guess he will never acquire Twitter. This is performative. we will look back and realize he never wanted Twitter, he did this all as a big middle finger to SEC and manipulated the market to get bigger share of Tesla, which he all has bigger capacity to earn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 13:31:06'] I think he may be just using this as a way to put fear in the employees to not raise a stink about the mandatory return to the office/factory/whatever

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 22:24:02'] Of course it will, when it’s making $100 billion in net income a year.Assuming they revenue growth of 50% a year as analysts expect, and current net income of $12 billion, it would take 5 or 6 years.That’s not accounting for the fact that they probably won’t hit 50% growth next year since there will be a recession and people won’t be buying as many cars, nor is it accounting for the fact that long term growth of 50% is impossible and they have to start seeing diminishing returns sooner or later.But that’s also not taking into account certain lightning in a bottle type scenarios that can get them back to 50% and maybe even beyond, like $20k car, mass adoption of the semi, self driving robotaxis taking over the world and bankrupting Lyft and Uber, major margin improvements, price increases of FSD, bitcoin appreciation, Optimus robot taking over the world and destroying the low skill labor market (Optimus alone could be worth many trillions alone), as well as a bunch of other things.Who knows, but if you see a path to $100 billion of net income annually, and assuming a 10 p/e which is more than fair, then yes they will get back to a trillion and probably far beyond

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 11:11:23'] Tesla was a meme stock supported by crowd enthusiasm, meaning as soon as it became unpopular there was no reason for it's high price. Not even the most rosy of possible outcomes where it completely dominated the auto industry would have justified it's value.It was always a speculation time bomb.There is a price at which tesla makes sense as a value for a car company that makes relatively innovative cars.  It hasn't been anywhere near that price for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 14:05:58'] Still overpriced
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 12:34:19'] I have always felt that Tesla was an interesting car company and that Musk did an outstanding job penetrating that wall of money and history.   But as a car company it has been tremendously overvalued for a long time and given Musk simply going insane with Twitter and his penetration and embracing of the far Right Q cult I think we will see that overvaluation go away fairly quickly.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 19:02:38'] This is just my dumb opinion, but long term, GM and Ford are too big to lose.  They will get their EV market share eventually.  It should be a growing market though so maybe there’s enough room for Tesla to thrive, but I think they will be #3 at best.  Or maybe EM gets bored, retires, and sells to Ford.  Ha.

Their market dominance is waning. They’re being competed with in every car market out there from the mid range up to the high end. And all against companies that have a long history of performance, quality, and long term reliability. As soon as somebody else puts through a real charging network Tesla will be a small fry that gets either gobbled up or fades to being irrelevant. If the big auto manufacturers were sArt they’d band together to make charging a one size fits all proposition and lobby to have charging stations installed as part of the nations infrastructure. The build quality of Tesla has improved. But go sit in a 2 yr old Tesla and then do the same with a Hyundai and tell me which one hasn’t started to fall to shit.

Don't try to spread FUD.Plus, it's autopilot, if there is issue, it will be patched without any noticable cost for Tesla.> Its CEO has just declared Texas and Berlin (sic) are losing billions:No he didn't. He said they are very capital intensive and that Tesla is spending bilions in very short time frame to build them rapidly. Which is normal when you build factories. Also, factories don't make money, products from them do.> 2 years after promises of robo-taxis that are deadHow is beta in hands of hundreds of thousands "dead in the water" with progress being made and visible every few months?Sure, timeline slipped, but so it did for literally every single one autonomus cars company.> Cybertruck and the Tesla semi delayed time and time again, whilst Daimler, BYD and others already sell BEV semis' in US and other markets and Ford moving ahead with the electric F150:Daimler, BYD and rest are not production constrained and overflown with orders. Opening additional product lines (with rises operating costs) would only decrease profit for Tesla. Seriously, Tesla is so in demand that orders are so backlogged people buys used Teslas for more than new ones.Also, so far, Tesla is only one actually making money on EVs.> Whilst Tesla is about to announce 250K deliveries for April, May and June, BYD announced 114,000 plug-ion sales in May alone, in locked down ChinaHybrids are not EVs. Might as well compare Tesla to tractors.> Whilst Tesla remains the leader in Europe in terms of model sales in 2022 (in part because the other companies offer multiple EV's), it is only in third place by brand, by virtue of the underperformence of Hyundai and VW, who guess what, also have massive demand for EV's they cannot meet due to supply issuesTesla has no operational factory in EU (yet). This comparison will only make sense when they do.Want fair comparison? Compare globaly.> The list of competitive and regulatory hurdles for Tesla goes on and on and on...What list of hurdles? The FUD above?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 04:25:02'] Reduced production from China is from COVID-19 lockdowns, everyone knows about this and adjusted their expectations from this one time event. It's a non issue as production is above it's per day numbers. Then, they are increasing the amount of cars they'll make at that factory with an expansion that'll increase production by \~15%.Every new factory loses money when they make few cars at the start.That robotaxi article is for a chinese robotaxi and Tesla is making a robotaxi in the US.Other companies making EV's is irrelevant. Many companies can exist and be profitable in competition, look at ICE cars now, how many companies exist and all are fine. It seems like your argument about Hyundai and VW making EV's is that you think there can be only one company in the end. All will make the most they can produce and sell at a profit since neither will ever make enough EV's to meet demand on their own for the world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 06:10:58'] I bought Tesla. I agree with so many criticisms of the company but it is supported by a billionaire who won't give it up and has the momentum of millions of fanboys. It has a great valuation already with little accomplished. When they get more charging stations, I can see the valuation getting really high. This is basically just a hedge against looking like an idiot if it quintuples in value. I don't have have a big portion of my net worth or anything in Tesla. Its basically a car company that could legitimately get a lot more cars on the road than it currently has so I think its an okay bet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 08:53:30'] I see your concerns but a recall for Tesla just means another update so that doesn’t really effect them at all. I would speculate that layoffs have something to do with the rising stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 09:53:58'] A lot of this has come recently, I don't think this is long term. It seems Musk is just trying to push all the bad into this quarter and drop expectations. Next quarter they'll meet expectations, than start surpassing them again afterwards. With Shanghai being locked down due to COVID outbreak as well with Berlin and Texas just opening they're gonna be at pretty big lows for production which is their biggest problem. They're also throwing quite a bit of lay offs (from what I've heard it's been almost entirely management very few actual workers have been laid off). A lot of the announcements don't make much sense or just seem odd to announce at the time. It seems they're trying to just move all their upcoming bad stuff into this quarter so when they don't meet targets they can blame the recession. They take the time to fix the issues during the quarter and essentially use the recession to restructure for something more long term sustainable than the growth they've been pushing for the last decade. They meet expectations next quarter as they exit the restructuring phase. Then they start running afterwards and get back on track. Tesla has a good mission and makes pretty nice cars while making a nice profit (good for shareholders). The main issue I've heard people take with Tesla's is either small errors in quality (panel gaps and stuff, they can take it to the local dealership/service center and it will get fixed under warranty), or issues with Musk himself (general doucheness and politics). One of the biggest issues with the stock itself in my opinion and opinion of many I know is the dividends, a lot of people like stocks with small dividend yields that still get good growth but have a bit of passive income to compound back onto their investments.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 10:35:04'] No sir, PE’s are based on growth rates period.  A 50% CAGR gives you justifiably a 150 PE.

I don’t think retailers are this stupid to buy at this price. I think it’s hedge funds who need to put the money somewhere. No one throws hard worked money in companies with almost 100 P/E

I dont own a Tesla now, but I have bought TSLA. I wasn’t interested in the reliability of my Honda. I’m interested in what a Tesla can do.Brand tribalism. History is replete with examples of “hype” building recognition. Just look at IBM. Innovation may begin as hype, but we know that positive customer sentiment among recognized innovators (or designer brands) often commands higher prices and higher customer retention, which can be leveraged for product growth.Productization. When it becomes Tesla vs. Other Company, you realize there’s a product future. Will you buy the Tesla motorcycle, Tesla drone, Tesla RV, Tesla Yacht, Tesla Jet Ski, Tesla Jet Pack… or the other?Innovative Distribution. A higher profit model doesn’t always lead to competitive distribution. A culture of innovation can drive benefits in distribution. Multiple Winners. There wasn’t just one winner among Microsoft, Apple, and HP. We know that markets have room for multiple players. Tesla co-exists.Competitiveness. On the other hand, unrecognized innovation could just create higher R&D costs required to compete... “Saturn had an electric vehicle, I think?”Simply put, I recognize Tesla as the innovator in electric vehicles and associate it with what’s coming next. That’s why I watch TSLA and often buy the dip.

He found a sneaky way to dump Tesla stock & put  blame on someone else & bought a shiny new toy in the process. I hope Reddit goes public & adds new feature to Reddit so it  gains all the Twitter that flee once Elon’s purchase goes through. And I’ll be buying Reddit stock with my Twitter profits.

At these low prices, it will sell like hotcakesInteresting to note that the prices in China 2.5% lower for Model 3 and 5.8% lower for Model Y than July 2021, so this seems to be at least partially a normalization after a rapid increase in prices.

Musk getting stoned and talking of roaring 20's.  Don't sell volatility he could be talking about the 1920's."

Doesn't matter if it is furniture, clothing, or cars. Tesla is creating an evolving factory line and spending little on marketing. It changes 24 times every week. That is huge! Doesn't matter the industry 24 changes in processes a week will disrupt any industry.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 18:58:59'] It beat expectations when other companies are struggling to get chips for cars etc.  Everyone knew TSLA was going up today after the weekend reporting and gap openers can have good intraday momentum.  Will it hold the move?  That remains to be seen but there's no need to be that surprised.It did fall from 1220 to 900 over the last couple months, but good news will move a momentum stock and the first week of Jan is typically bullish as well since tax loss harvesting is over etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:07:01'] Tesla is a great day or swing trade. Buy when it drops low, watch the charts for momentum of course and then sell at a certain percentage, typically 7-9% if momentum slows. 10-13% if it doesn’t. Follow your rules and you can make money. If you sell when momentum slows and it starts moving again buy back in and ride it higher. Tesla is one of the best volatile stocks to do this with.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:21:45'] 280 shares @ $61/avg here. I could really use the money but decide to live like a broke mofo because convinced it’ll be worth 7 figures in not too distant future. Don’t underestimate the amount of people who see Tesla as more than a car company.Edit: “Tesla is like the mechanical rabbit at the dog race.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 20:05:48'] You are looking at it wrong.  Tsla shouldn't have dipped so much because Elon was selling.  It just recovered what should not have been a dip.  The deliveries are justifying the valuation. Tsla is growing into the financials/ valuation over time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 21:28:53'] I'm with you OP. This market is set to take a major dive. Tesla will definitely be one of them that gets a true value thrown into the mix.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 21:33:19'] That’s not what happened.  What happened was they performed so people bought.Also the recall is a simple fix that can be done by mobile service in 20 min if something is wrong.  Market Cap is garbage and is a poor way to analyze if something is worth buying, selling, or holding.  It’s worth it if people want to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 21:49:25'] They are very aggressive on selling cars, I was planning to buy one 6 mos ago? I decided not to anymore but their reps keeps messaging and asking me if I’m still interested in getting a model 3. I’m bout to pay off my car and idk if I want another car payment lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 21:50:47'] Tesla is an excellent company. Absolutely amazing product and great growth prospects. But at its current valuation, I cannot justify putting my money into it. Happy to just watch from the sidelines and be patient.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 21:56:44'] I agree that it is disproportionate but also keep in mind that a lot of people doubted Tesla could turn a profit, could beat sales estimates due to the considerate market problems and issue with China wanting to promote their own electric vehicles and it being a major market for Tesla - and Tesla becoming more challenged in Europe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 22:08:14'] A few things missed here. It isn't just about an additional $2B. After Q4 they have an annual run rate of 1.23M units without counting 2 brand new factories.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 22:31:25'] Yes, all factual but what is your point?It’s not unusual for the market to be in divergence from fundamentals, also you are assuming that Tesla is a car company but in reality it’s not, you could be right in the long term and as long as you are solvent during this volatility you should come out ok.

Most of them would shell out extra $$$ too to install solar since their system is all integrated with one another.To top it off, they have a monopoly on its installation too. You have to be certified with Tesla in order to install their shit. I feel cars are just the tip of the iceberg and I’m genuinely curious why people ignore this company’s other sources of income when they complain about this stock. I’m trying to understand as a neutral investor who doesn’t really care or know all too much about this stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 00:06:19'] Dec 2020 Tesla had a p/e - ratio of 1100, for those of you who don't know what the p/e - ratio is, its price/earnings and a pe of 1100 means that Tesla would have to continue to earn a stable amount over the next 1100 years to be able to earn their market value. Theoretically that means Tesla has the means to double its value by the year 3120 through reinvestment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 03:42:12'] I don’t like musk, and I’ve never owned a share of Tesla. But the best argument I’ve heard for teslas valuation came from musk himself. He said in an interview, “Warren Buffett may be a good investor, I don’t know, but I don’t know why anyone would give him $1 to invest in soda companies which are slowly killing people. I want to try and advance humanity, and I think that’s worth more to a lot of people than giving coca-cola another dollar.” - Now I would argue that so far musk hasn’t really “done” anything to advance humanity. EVs existed before him, as did rockets, but things are moving quicker because of him, and I could see how it’s possible in 10 years we are better off as a society with tesla around and money to spend on new ideas than not. So I’m actually ok with tesla trading at a ridiculous multiple, it allows them to do more interesting things. It’s a lot better than giving that multiple to coca-cola or JP Morgan, or Berkshire that’s for sure. And I think cause of that, I’ll just go buy a little tesla and join the party and hope they invent something really cool one day that changes our lives a lot for the better.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 04:07:18'] The reason posts like this keep popping up is because it’s valuation makes no sense to anyone living in the real world, Tesla is basically valued at being every persons car by the year 2025 or 2030 and they’re not even close to that. It doesn’t make sense when the stock doesn’t drop on a massive recall and pops on a small profit like this. The bubble is insane, people are straight up delusional

Why the f___ are people betting against a cult?Would you bet again Christianity or Islam? “Tech bros” and “wannabes”, including myself sorry to say, see the vision of the future musk speaks of - clean energy here on Earth, and the colonisation of Mars.It’s a cult and a company and a cult, with a weird characteristic leader who likes to meme. Tesla is a crazy investment for a normal person, because it’s abnormal people foaming at the mouth fuelling Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 06:58:14'] You don’t buy Tesla because of their sales in 2021. You buy Tesla because you believe that they will be the biggest car manufacturer in the world one day. Beating estimates leads to that. If you don’t believe in the company, you can stay away from it or short it. I choose the former because a lot of people lose a lot of money doing the latter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 07:23:51'] I got the latest data from Tesla's 2Q 2022 financial reports. Compared to 1Q, 2Q is a weaker quarter operationally. This is due mainly to factory disruptions in China and overall supply chain shortages (chips). On the brighter side, services, energy generation & storage, and auto leasing, albeit small, are becoming profit-making or breakeven. As the fleet size of Tesla cars increases, this portion of the business will only become bigger and more profitable, which is the main way that the traditional car makers are making the most of their money.

These numbers will only get better (relatively) as recession sets in. Tesla sells 0 low income cars, meaning they’ll be effected far less than companies that sell vehicles to these low income families (the ones that cut spending first). Tesla also doesn’t have a super “lucrative” pile of debt that risks defaults when no one can make car payments.. I believe defaults are already beginning to ramp up similar to 08.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 06:22:57'] Regardless of “slowing growth” as we enter a recession….. DCF will tell you tesla is at fair value with growth of *only* ~50%, ~40%, ~ 20, and ~10% over the next few years. Imo they’ll hit closer to ~50% yoy every year in this forecast, for these reasons. All of teslas currently “ramped” factory’s are at or nearing 1 mil capacity, but are still due for expansion. Tesla two other factories, Berlin and Texas, are no where close to fully ramped but based on Shanghai’s ramp time they should be pushing out a mil by ~2024. That alone puts them at 100%+ growth in capacity. Not to mention in that time frame another factory will start construction, while I’m 100% sure another factory will be announced in that time frame.Tesla has also consistently shrunk opex % of Rev. 9x delivery’s while only ~3x employee count over the last 5 years, new factories are becoming more efficient as they learn, as well as having highly efficient R&D spending adding to their high return on investments, margins have also been growing pretty consistently https://autoinsights.substack.com/p/understanding-teslas-operating-leverage

It‘s just a question wether the company is more equity or debt financed that‘s all. A company with high volatility line tesla prefers equity finance, that‘s why they issue more stocks than let‘s say volkswagen, who have steady income and therefor benefit from huge taxshields with debt finance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 08:30:28'] You are just cherry-picking which companies to compare the market cap with. While I agree that Nvidia's market cap is higher than of other chip makers combined, your combination of chip makers is purposely ignoring big chip makers (e.g. TSMC and Samsung who combined have a greater market cap than Nvidia). By your logic, I can just say that the GDP of Somalia (7,293 billion) is higher than that of more than 5 countries combined (Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands). While this argument is true, it fails to take into consideration the difference in size of these countries and purposefully neglects other countries who have a similar GDP to Somalia, thus presenting a distorted image that overinflates the image of Somalia.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 20:16:43'] I believe the EV market captures 3% of all vehicles in the United States currently. Its projected to capture 30% by 2030. It will likely be a quicker transition to EVs then that. Tesla will inevitably lose market share to competition, especially if Elon continues to neglect his crown jewel of companies. I see Tesla as more of a energy company then a automobile company. Sure the autos will allow for scale but I’m really interested in the ability of Tesla to innovate on its batteries, charger network, manufacturing, and AI. Combining these technologies will create for some very interesting synergies that can bring the world into a new age.

At the end of the day, Tesla was never going to be the sole EV seller in the world. That is why they are also focused on self-driving capabilities and have improved their supercharging network to offer ancillary benefits.Tesla had near 100% market share a decade ago. Do you think they would rather be where they are a decade ago or today? Market share is more pronounce in a mature industry. When you're in the early stages, of course your market share will decrease.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 22:47:06'] For newcommers in stock market investments, the common recommendations is to start with a ETF - one large enough (Vanguard)  - check on your broker account if there is a core list with zero fees (I found it for me and I buy monthly with 25% of income on same ETF again and again).  One with dividend distribution is great, as you can reinvest the dividends now or to access the dividends. This is lower risk than picking stocks.I would study the idea to buy with mortgages. I know the interests are big now but are still smaller than inflation, and think there is the possibility to refinance once the interests are going down (I did this during the covid and I have a such a small interest). The idea is the rent to cover the mortgage and if you have any extra savings and no other idea what to do with money, pay faster the mortgage.  I have a few properties (smaller than you, far away smaller than you, my income is like 10% from Rentals but one day loans will finish one after the other ...) and my only regret is to not start using this tool earlier. You already have 100k in savings, you can use a part for a pay down and closing costs for a new home and add a mortgage now.  In the next year you can save another 100k and do it again etc.I know you are focused in rentals as you are good on it, but I would not totally dismiss the idea to invest in 401K + ROTH as are taxed deductible money - but postpone it. Until then read or maybe speak with a tax advisor, there are some tricks to access this money earlier without fees, learn how to  rollover from a 401(k) plan to Roth Ira, how much money from Roth you can access, how much taxes you will pay on the dividends, but definitely you have to split your saving monthly money into your a big Emergency Fund (as you have 4 big properties and things can go broken /vacancy / renovations between tenants) , the brokerage account, money for a new real estate and the pension plans.In the meantime, read some books on how to pick a Company that match your vision: how to interpret the graphics of the stock price, to look at their vision and investments, understand the P/E, volatility, read their financial periodically reports, how much loans they have, exposure, their competitors etc etc -  and definitely build a  strategy, asset allocations, diversification of the portfolio in different industries, how much of portfolio to put in one stock, how much of portfolio to put in one industry, how much of portfolio to put in a country etc etc.  This takes time so I finally add to my portfolio   a new stock each 2-3 months.

Stop being a workaholic, invest in yourself, work part-time if you still want to do something, and learn how to turn that online business from $10k a month to $100k per month, travel the world, while you do it, that's the perks of having a successful online business.There's people out there that can help with that for half of what you make per month, and probably in 1-3 years max to get there which doing the numbers thats approx 1.2mil a year in less than 3 year, which putting that money in an ETF or fund would give you on average 10% componding on top of what you add will take you 10 years to get to 1.2mil.Or stick to what you know in property which with growth and income will give you 10-15% growth per annum anyway.But with the extra cash from business you could be getting higher quality properties with higher rental yeilds oh and diversify your properties to other states, so your not expposed to any state laws that could reduce your income.And hope you have these properties under a business which is part of a trust? Extra protection and Tax benifits.But like I said see a Financial Advisor, thats what they're there for, you have the money, do what the rich do, build people around you, stop trying to do everything yourself.Just sayin 🤷‍♀️

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 01:39:49'] Remember, he thought the stock price was projected way too far in the future when it was half of what it is now. He specifically said the company would have trouble meeting the consistent earnings growth that the stock price demanded over the next 10 years.So, if he believed that previously and the stock nearly doubles, selling some stock at this new high seems logical. But how do you do it without inadvertently announcing to the world that you KNOW this is the peak, which would cause an insane sell off? You do this. You make it about something else. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but it makes sense.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 06:23:57'] 10% won’t even make a dent for him. He’s trying to save face but he’s still an asshole billionaire. Don’t fall for this.

When Tesla stock is at the All Time High.Of course he wants to sell the stock, but he wants to make it look like he is not taking money out of the company. If he was to just sell 10% of the company without this charade, investors would be wondering why the owner was selling stock and the stock price would plummet as people raced to withdraw money from the company.Instead, he has made it looks like the will of the people has spoken and his hands are now tied into selling the stock.Beware, Elon is a snake and a known market manipulator.

There are so many loopholes and systems and corruptions in place that they have access to, which means even the cash they have is untaxed.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:14:57'] Just the fact that everyone is preparing to buy the dip means it won't dip.More likely it will get people selling other stocks to buy the dip. Thereby causing the rest of the market to dip.I'm starting to understand how this game works.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:35:12'] I'd be willing to bet the SEC is going to dig into him again for market manipulation, since these tweets almost certainly had an effect on stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 01:38:41'] I honestly don't understand this company.

And those are only two of them.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 23:32:41'] Of course he is going to do it. He had made his decision and knew that he was going to do it before he even made the tweet because he is smart enough to know what the results of the poll were obviously going to be when phrased in that manner and posted on a social platform dominated by liberals.It is actually quite genius the way he did this. If he just randomly sold, he would get a lot of hate for that, but this way he is tying his sell-off to something that many people that support taxing billionaires would view in a positive light and therefore branding it in a popular way, putting the responsibility of the decision on to the people rather than himself even though he only did it this way because he knew how the vote would obviously go, and getting more free publicity for Tesla out of it in the process.Absolute genius. Elon is playing chess while everybody else is playing checkers.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 00:19:13'] Absolutely no one on here has a clue what your talking about. #1 Elon didn’t wake up this morning and decide to put 10% of his net worth in the hands of a Twitter poll and #2 he can’t dump the stock on Monday. Learn how the market works before you make ridiculous posts. This is 100% premeditated and Elon has been planning this for weeks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 23:34:36'] It seems pretty clear that he wants to cash in while Tesla stock is high and likely at unsustainable levels. But he doesn't want it to look like he cashed in on his own bubble without a heads up. It's honestly a respectable move, but clearly he wants to sell some stock and wants to be told to do it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 23:16:32'] If this is simply about should he pay tax, I think his responsibility is to follow the law, and if he has paid all tax required he should not pay another cent
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 23:49:01'] He doesn't tweet you geniuses. Those tweets are from his communication team and vetted by legal department beforehand. They weigh the benefits vs potential risks before vetting any tweet. He's probably asked if he's okay with it or he looks at the end of his workday or during commute.It would be too time consuming for him to handle his account the way it is done. He would have to be spending too much time on Twitter and the guy is a workaholic and IDGAF type.Regarding the sale: he's just realising his gains probably to fund some other venture. The shareholders have asked for more information about the company to be made available. Maybe there's a downside risk to valuation in the near future pursuant to the release of those information.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 03:57:33'] Why has he got to be a smart ass about this? He's basically holding the company's value at ransom for those who feel he should pay tax and he claims it's the only way.It's not! How about being paid in taxable income instead of equity?How about making sensible donations to the value of tax he should be paying out of the loans secured against his equity?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 20:16:31'] No way Elon has standard stock the public can buy right? I thought execs get preferred or a different class of stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 20:31:27'] Firstly the unrealized capital gain tax has been eliminated as an option. So there's no need for him to generate money to pay that. He's simply making a political statement that he feels gains should be able to be compounded tax free.  And he's using fear through his powerful platform and financial power to spook us so we don't think of it again. But he knows he has to liquidate some stock or borrow on margin to pay tax on upcoming expiring stock options which allows him to follow through moderately should he choose.

They will make at least 15 billion in revenue this quarter alone.  For comparison, that is about half of what General motors makes with 88 factories versus Tesla checking in with 2.  2 factories made 15 billion.  Crazy.

There’s no deny that focusing on having a growing stock market helping many US companies to gain their brand recognition around the world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 01:25:43'] Sorry just one question if anybody know the answer. I am not a fan of the China model when it comes to coming down on successful business people. China is currently threatening Taiwan and India. Power outages are apparently rampant.But amazingly China has opened the door for Tesla. Tax breaks, no red tape, apparently only limited exposure to Covid by his employees. If I remember correctly, China refused to import any more teslas because of the camera security issues. I was just wondering, what had to be given up or not done that allows Elon to walk freely. I thought Alibaba had done quite well. Why wouldn’t Elon be concerned of the same time off that jack ma was given. A forced vacation of sorts. I don’t know. I’m an old guy. Just worried.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 07:26:46'] Netflix is still relevant, but a few changes would make me happy as a customer.This password thing I feel is generating less revenue for Netflix. For people who bought the service, they should be able to use Netflix anywhere. In their car, mobile, office. Wherever. Shouldn't be a hassle for a paying customer.Some of these shows, suck. They feel like they're the same. I love Netflix, otherwise I wouldn't be a customer. But some of these shows.... why was any money spent of them? I'd rather have LESS shows with BETTER QUALITY.Trivia games I've played, have been fun actually. I'd be into seeing some more game ideas added. This does set Netflix apart from its competitors.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:56:57'] Anyone who watches Netflix and has been for years realizes that they are the Apple of streaming. Their interface, production process, and algorithms *work*. Simply and elegantly. Netflix is the only interface that I go to because it *never* hits me with commercials, which I hate. Somehow I can find shows I like, shows I would never see somewhere else. This is how they got to where they are, and this is what they keep on being. I've very happy that their valuation is coming into reality. That only makes it more likely that they will outplay, outwit, and outlast the competition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 09:34:19'] Password sharing caused Netflix to lose a lot of subscribers. Additionally, frequent cancellation of popular shows is super frustrating

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 08:53:38'] Yea Netflix is overrated and overvalued. Their r&d and marketing team is overpaid, if the best they could do is negate password sharing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 09:45:16'] No cash flow predictability. FCF has had billion dollar swings from year to year. So I guess you have to use EBITDA. I calculate an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of over 28. That’s ridiculous for a company with drastically reduced Revenue growth.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 09:50:42'] Bubble stock yet again. Enterprise value to EBITDA is almost 29. FCF is $2B one year but only $500M prior year. A few years ago a negative $2B. No consistency let alone predictable cash flows.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 13:40:36'] Wish all the worst on them for all the crap they have pulled.Yeah I know not a very unbiased but it annoys me that they get away with so much garbage content because no one really bothers unsubscribing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 00:00:40'] Netflix is terrible for the user. Bad shows, embarrassingly old series touted as “new seasons” when there are two old seasons to choose from. Tendency to supply woke virtue signalling shows and movies with big names who can’t even bother acting for their bloated pay.Netflix has been bad for years and eventually it will fail…just a matter of when.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 14:55:31'] My son had a good idea for Netflix, have an achievement system. Everytime you complete a show, you get an achievement and have a page where you can see all your achievements and make it shareable to social media. People love achievements. There could be an achievement called "Action Hero" if you watch every action movie new for the month. This would help keep people engaged in the service. It's all about engagement.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 11:27:48'] This is one reason i am bullish on some of their competition. I made good money already thinking this way but would have made more with NFLX itself lol. On the other hand itll take 1-4 years to see if im right.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 11:34:47'] As someone who wants to short but also not want to cancel my subscription, I'll just sit this one out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:34:53'] Look at Nvidia. Tesla should swap their P/E with them.

POST_TEXT: b" For the third day in a row, **Tesla** stock is riding higher -- up 4.3% as of 10:10 a.m. ET. The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates only 25 basis points yesterday is probably part of the reason for that -- indeed, growth stocks in general seem happy to run today, with the entire Nasdaq up nearly 2%. \n\n And even more specifically, Tesla's electric car Gigafactory inShanghai.\n\nTesla's plan to cut the prices of its electric cars, you see -- not just in the U.S., but [in China as well](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/06/why-tesla-stock-dropped-again/) \\-- is having its intended effect of stoking consumer demand. As Reuters reported yesterday, Tesla is ramping up production of its popular Model 3 and Model Y EVs in Shanghai.

You could have bought dog shjt and made money.I think most your picks are crap. META, AAPL, SNAP are all garbage.I think AAPL and MSFT will be the biggest disappointment for the next 20 years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-10 08:15:16'] Excuse? It's not an excuse. It's just the way it is. He's a Forced Seller now-or he's a Forced Seller later. When he loses the Twitter case -the market makers of Tesla stock will open Tesla price the next morning- down the market cap of his Twitter obligations. So it's either sell now-at a known price- or sell when everyone else knows he has to sell- which would be a lot lower price.That's what is happening here in this sale- he's taking the bird in the hand. October's bird will turd in his hand.
