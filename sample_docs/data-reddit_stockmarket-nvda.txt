Literally, every single card could generate X dollars a day worth of Ethereum or whatever. So, people were buying them all up as fast as they could. The average person doesn't need to train an AI model. Sure, big companies will be training (And already do) AI models for various things with a combination of GPU and server farms, but most of them aren't going to buy more than a few thousand video cards, and a lot of those are going to be old crypto cards sold on the secondary market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 05:57:18'] Nvidia is trading at 10x sales. Meaning they would have to pay you every dollar that they make for ten years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:26:41'] There is no corroborating evidence that big tech has placed or will place big orders for chips from anyone. If they excluded multi billion dollar quarterly chip purchases in their own guidance, that would be outrageous. The back end producers such as TSM have likewise not shown any increase in orders, only a decrease. Who is buying the multi billion dollars of chips nvidia claims it‚Äôll sell in this quarter ? Who is building all the chips ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 02:02:51'] Smart cfo. When why did he sell stock right before earnings?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 22:58:01'] So, with Rosenblatt's $600.00 price target for Nvidia, let me say this. Nvidia's PE ratio is lower today than it was before earnings were reported. Over the next ten years, this company will experience rapid growth. Because of their rapid revenue growth, they will reach the $600.00 price target sooner than most expect. As previously stated, they control 80% of the global market. So, from an investment standpoint, this is a buy, which is why roughly two dozen analysts have raised their price targets. As I previously stated, 600.00 will arrive quickly in the coming months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 04:26:25'] Agreed, at what point do people just give up being wrong? Like ya, eventually it will pull back hard, but in the meantime it‚Äôs ripping higher and bears are only losing money. That must be difficult to cope with tbh

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 23:18:37'] Revenue is only one part of the equation. You'll have to understand each company as a whole before being able to perform comparative analysis. For example, each business has different segments, is doing different things, has different debt to equity, cash flow, etc... you're investing in the company as a whole (unless you're just speculating). Not necessarily just the individual segments. Although the individual segments may be the proposition for growth, it's not the only part of the company. Essentially, you'll need to deep dive into each of these companies to properly compare them.Even better, do you properly understand the business? For example, do you know what a wafer is vs. a microchip or the history of microchips and their use in the market? Do you fully understand and appreciate the technology? Is it something that you are really interested in (or studying)? Etc...

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:06:01'] That's not a head and shoulders. First of all TA requires candles, because the wicks and bodies are just as important.This is what you're looking at on the monthly: Also your "monthly" is just the last month. You're looking at daily price still.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/)On the daily this is called a tower.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/)It could signal reversal, but it could just be a pause and more upward.Tech Analysis is more about target price and risk management than about predicting direction. How much risk does it have to do the opposite of what you think, and how much reward could be expected if it does what you think.Bulkowski's patterns are very good for their target pricing. Most patterns are 50/50 on which direction they go, and they have 4 ways of getting there.1. Go your way2. Go against you.3. Go your way but then bust and reverse direction4. Go against you then bust and go your way.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/)This gap is a significant problem for bulls, gaps are usually filled. Traders know this. So they won't be buying. Only stooges buy something that gaps like this which is why the stock stalled. Retail is buying, traders are out, institutions likely aren't involved.[https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/)On a 4 hour this is a triple bottom. I am short AAPL for similar reasons. NVDA was more irrational because of the gap so I played AAPL instead.NVDA will likely fail the triple bottom and fill the gap. That's the trade I'd play if I weren't already playing it in AAPL and I'm also short SPY.I'm also long TLT and GLD so there's a bit of "counter trend" in my portfolio already so no need to go for NVDA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:10:52'] A couple more comments.Even if what you identified were a head and shoulders, which it isn't....* Rule of thumb, all head and shoulders are EXTREMELY well structured. When you actually see them there's no doubt about them. What you marked is a "jumbled mess".The head and shoulders was invalidated by today's trading.The neckline can't be broken. The neckline would be where the vallies are making the lowest lows of the head and shoulders.The peaks that make the shoulders have to be a certain height above the neckline - I forget what as it's generally irrelevant.As I said before:* TA is hardly predictive, it gives guidelines on how much risk to reward and that's useful enough.* But TA itself is usually a 50/50 crapshoot on where it goes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:10:28'] TA is not really appreciated here. Everything people say about it is correct. It predicts nothing. It merely provides a statistical model. If used properly, it can help tilt probabilities in your favor, which over time may be enough to provide a profitable strategy.That said, one could make a case for H&S pattern on NVDA 30-minute chart, but it's far from perfect. The left shoulder lasts only one day, the head two days, the right shoulder 5 days long so far.If NVDA closes below the earnings gap 366.35 for more than a day or two then it can start to get dicey. Until then, this is not a stock I would short. It has huge institutional support, despite the fact that it is grossly overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:17:40'] On the weekly this green arrow shows the prior All time high which is also the half-back of the move seen in the yellow box.A halfback occurs when one-time framing is halted which is 2 consecutive trading candles below the top bar (not wick) of the one-time frame.I don't want to explain it more...just note that the halfback matches the prior all time high test.This is strong correlation to at least that much pull back.https://www.tradingview.com/x/Iy6m9IEH/

But if today was first blood on tech stocks then ya good enough. It‚Äôs sort of a rounding top or island top. (Overall look for that massive daily gap to fill at some point. Wait for it to get close (mid 360s) then slap .

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:50:31'] If I owned it, I‚Äôd put a stop below the support. I wouldn‚Äôt buy it.  If I had some fundamental reason to buy, I‚Äôd use the same stop. I don‚Äôt know which way it‚Äôll go, but it isn‚Äôt trending up currently. If it made a move below a short may work.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 21:33:09'] It's impossible to do TA on the chart you provided, but just keep in mind that smart money sell into strength. As price moves up they sell. Retail does the exact opposite, they sell as the price moves down.This is how the institutional money buy low and sell high, while retail buy high and sell low.

That's a different topic altogether.Whatever restrictions the Executive Branch is doing on Nvidia's AI chip sales- don't have anything to do with the Legislative Branch.Nancy Pelosi does not trade stocks. She doesn't have time for that-she is the Speaker of the House. Way too busy for stocks. Paul Pelosi has a hedge fund since before most wall street bets guys were going peepee in pampers- Paul's best trade lately was Roblox - a video game thingy.  That's certainly can't even remotely be related to Congress.  This Nvidia trade was -I thought it was- a call options exercise from over a year long trade by the looks of it. Nvidia is a mainstream stock,  not some fringe pork belly futures. This Nvidia trade doesn't even look to be that great of a trade. Does he even beat the SPY index? Joe Biden has never owned a stock in his entire career and he's from the state with the most Fortune 500 companies. Delaware has more corporations than people. Never traded any stocks that's why people like him and why he got re-elected so many times. All his taxes are public records since 1973 - 50 years of public scrutiny. Bro. Not every politician is corrupt just because you don't like them. That's why Fox Ewes tells you to hate them.People get way too distracted by social culture issues and don't put enough energy towards supporting politicians who actually do fight corporate corruption and Congressional Fraud and Governmentfraud prevention. We don't give enough support to make anything happen in the United States Senate. That's the millstone hanging from everyone's neck. The only politicians in Congress who don't take money from corporations and corporate donors is AOC and several progressive politicians like AOC. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. Katie Porter. Ron Wyden. Those are some ones on the good guys team.   Whether you like it or not - whether you like them or not- they're the only ones who put Humans ahead of corporations. The only way to get corruption reforms, elections and voting reforms, and restore basic Civil Rights for women is to get a Senate majority. All of these types of issues that people want - have already passed Bipartisan Bills in the House of Representatives over the past decade.  A thousand Bipartisan bills have passed in the House of Representatives and it only takes 1 email from any Republicans to force a 60-yes vote just to get a senate floor debate. Not even a vote-Republicans just won't even allow any debate. That's Conservativism 101-don't allow debate in the first place.Conservatism is simply put: Loyalty to Elitists.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-02 03:25:28'] Pelosi is supposedly worth like $100m, I am as mad about potential insider trading as anyone but this is noise and hard to pin it as a gotcha moment. Obviously if she's able to do this again, and again, and again, "small" gains build up and perhaps that's the things to rail about, but there are probably bigger fish to fry.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-02 03:44:11'] i'm liberal af and i think elected officials and their staff should not be allowed to trade stock while in office. it makes a big impression to point out what Pelosi did, but it's used as a GOP talking point when their own people do it too. unfortunately it's not against the law, but it should be.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 20:56:42'] This thing REEKS of insider trading
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 19:59:35'] This is misleading, because anyone who has access to WSJ, Business Insider, NYT Business, Bloomberg, etc, could've told you this was coming down the pike since March.  We've been using everything we have at our disposal to regain control in the balance that the orange moron screwed up. China isn't budging on a lot of what he gave them, so using the chip market against them was definitely coming. Pelosi cannot trade anything, so someone else does it for her, with a fire wall where she cannot know what is or isn't in the account. If they traded it in July and purchased before March, her accounts likely lost money.  All the chips manufacturers have been down for several months.  So the claim here is probably false. At best her broker kept her from losing an additional $600k.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 18:33:53'] She needs to go. They are slobs, enough already, how much money do they need. Fucking grotesque, pigs at a trough. While her worthless husband goes to jail for drunk driving. Such a waste

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 07:56:47'] As a general rule, politicians accounts are held in managed accounts‚Äîthey‚Äôve given their advisor discretion so they‚Äôre not leading the trading. This interesting and absolutely should be looked at, but isn‚Äôt necessarily wrong. NVDA has been down 40+% for a lot of this year. maybe they‚Äôre just trying to cut losses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 08:18:31'] Stupid af. Cries if she buys cries if she sells. You're like small infant children upset things aren't going your way or no one's sharing w you. If you think politicians haven't been raking in the doe in behind door deals and handshakes since before America was America you're mistaken.

Thus stocks like NVDA and other semiconductor stocks on this chart could return to their levels seen at the beginning of this year. $200 is only a change in PE ratio from 40x to 38x, as the stock was trading below $200 in January.

It dropped to as much as $145.23 and anyone who follows Pelosi's stock buys had plenty of time to buy it before it got back to $158 because he was forced to disclose the sale.That said I agree there needs to be stricter rules about congress and stock buys.Not sure what to do though, the guy is a hedge fund owner.

The news/media makes it sound like bull market and increasing stock prices is good, and decreasing prices and bear markets are bad, and it‚Äôs really annoying  Whether a market is good/bad depends on the individual investor‚Äôs positioning.  In a bear market, when prices are declining then having a negative delta position is statistically favorable, so that‚Äôs why I have that position, so to go in the opposite direction is what‚Äôs bad.I was praying for Jerome Powell to come out and announce an emergency 1,000 bps hike in the fed funds rate.

That is what I am doing.  This is not the bottom.  This is the middle.  Don't diddle in the middle.Her strategy is investors buy into ARKK because it is funded in these stocks and investors don't invest in ARKK for the cash positions.  You can look up the interview on YouTube for reference.  People do well in bull markets, but realyl good investors don't do well in down turns.  She is not a good investor.  I have done better than her and I am a retail investor.  This is not a micro dip, it is a canyon.

(Just bought a new Alienware computer at the last sale and was seriously thinking of waiting).  So she's right as long as demand goes up. Except, we are in a recession and the Fed promised to crack nuts to tame inflation. This means less demand for the latest and greatest gaming and graphics computers. Although, on some machines, you can change the card.  NVDA might be a good options play when the chip is released depending on the market conditions at that time. You're welcome.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 05:48:00'] He‚Äôs buying up nvda
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 12:11:52'] Reasons to be short NVDA:* Their ARM merger fell through.* Crypto mining is mostly over.* The used GPU market is thriving.* Intel has entered their market and won't give up any time soon.* The US banned them from supplying certain cards to China.This all looks priced-in though, the stock has been tanking for months. There has to be a bottom as they are still a market-leader and they're willing to make bold moves.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 03:47:47'] The two best stocks for the next 10 years imo
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 06:13:24'] They are the components of everything driving progress forward
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 06:06:35'] Keep holding both stocks until retirement.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 10:50:33'] NVIDIA easily a 1t cap company. Pretty much a monopoly in GPUs and backordered til eternity in their B2B business.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 07:02:35'] Strong buy both
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 04:29:18'] I always liked AMD products, they are very competitive with Nvida and Intel - and up until just recently their products delivered better performance. Computer Engineer
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 07:40:58'] AMD. In at 15, out at 120ish. NVIDIA didn't touch becauseof crypto bloat. Good company, just overvalued in my opinion. It'd be on my buy list in a major correction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 13:15:57'] NVDA is going to be the next $1T company and is poised for some serious long term growth. Plus, they‚Äôre a decent amount below their 52-week high unlike AMD. about 6% versus 12% off
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 06:10:43'] Overvalued and essential

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 08:43:54'] I think AMD will grow faster but NVDA will soon have a substantial services vertical giving it a more premium multiple than AMD (which it already has as well). But I love them both. Can't get enough of them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 09:20:21'] Why not both?
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 11:10:50'] Very similar but I would choose NVDA over AMD. Can't go wrong with either tho
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 03:30:28'] NVDA seems higher valued and AMD also have CPUs which NVDA don‚Äôt so my money would go to AMD right now
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 04:34:55'] Good companies (at least AMD, hate Nvidia's monopolistic actions and threats) and good products but overpriced stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 07:17:24'] Realistically these companies are going to continue to thrive. The need for parallel processing capability of GPUs is going to continue to grow exponentially. Autonomous vehicles, surveillance, ar/vr/gaming, industrial applications including edge compute, it's not going to slow down. The biggest threat is for something to come in and overtake the silicon-based chip and I can't see that happening at scale for at least a decade even if something like a quantum breakthrough happened tomorrow. It's not likely a lot of competition comes in to eat market share, and even if it does, the market is going to grow so quickly you won't notice it. Both of these are a key part of my portfolio. I just kick myself for selling some shares back in early 2021 for another play that has not panned out.Edit: added comma for grammar
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 07:52:23'] I hold positions on both. Doing quite well and plan on holding for a while. Also a fan of AVGO.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 08:47:26'] not a buy rn, waiting for both of them to establish a basis, than might get a nice position. they are def the future

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 09:55:56'] With a correlation coefficient approaching 0.99, an arbitrage opportunity seems like a smart trade. The next time they diverge significantly, I'd pick up some options until the gap is closed.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 14:34:29'] If you bought low, hold and take profits whenever you feel like it. But not enough margin of safety to initiate a position at these multiples‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 17:44:45'] Both stocks, $AMD in particular, performed tremendously over the last 20 months as lockdowns helped accelerate the tech boom and demand for products which rely on microchip technology.     It‚Äôll be interesting to see whether they can continue on the same trajectory next year, or whether they first need to pullback before making another leg higher. All trading carries risk, but $NVDA and $AMD are both definitely worth watching.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 17:55:54'] Bought AMD at 55$ in June 2020. 200% gains. Best ever in my portfolio!
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 20:19:17'] Bullish for long term; especially as electric cars & crypto mining becomes a bigger thing in the future!
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 02:33:14'] Bought in at $95 and held for what felt like forever. Sold because it didn‚Äôt seem like it was going anywhere and low and behold it moons after a few months of me selling smh

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 11:56:41'] Nvda is overpriced, amd 150-200 seems fair. Intel at 50 is way undervalued. Imo.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 08:39:26'] We have 4500+ stocks in Newyork stock exchange. However NVDA is one of the  highly discussed stock in the internet. Why ? There might be a reason.What I know.. many foreign retailers buy NVDA stock by paying international transaction cost.It means this stock crazy is not just limit to US. Many ppl who use NVDA product they like it and buy this stock.Yes it is truly $10T in next 5 to 10 years‚Ä¶IMO.NVDA won‚Äôt manufacture chips. They design high end GPUs and AI chips and give manufacturing order to TSM and Samsung. This is grate advantage on quick design change and adopt to new architecture design. This is one reason their chips are high cost. (What I remember is, they have one graphic card which price more than $30k . Still it has demand and customer are buying)NVDA has pricing power in the market like Apple. No other chip maker has that power.NVDA means speed.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 10:15:47'] I would dump both. They‚Äôve reached their cyclical peaks and are going down with the rest of the (tech) market. If you love the businesses, wait and buy them on sale in 1-2 years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 08:02:40'] i‚Äôve got both of their products in my computer, and will continue to buy them with every upgrade. I believe in if, so I buy and hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 08:46:42'] I have both of them, more from NVDA. I believe both of them will have a bright future. NVDA will likely be used more in servers for CUDA processing and things like network training. However I have one thing that worries me and that is that companies are designing their own processors. Apple made their M1 chip and on the server side Amazon and Google are design and implementing their own chips specifically made for servers. For example, AWS is going to offer server space that utilizes AWS chips or NVDA chips that can use CUDA processing. In that case it's up to the customer to decide. For ongoing projects it's not easy to switch but new projects from startups could be made on processing power from a different working environment. That being said what do other people think of this. The server side has a nice profit margin, it would be a shame for both companies if they might lose future market share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 08:47:33'] In my expert opinion, it'll probably be fine.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 08:49:38'] Bought 1 nividia and 2 amd about a month ago still in the red with them but they will go up in the future,intel is cheaper and if the stars align can be worth just as much.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 09:01:13'] I'm playing them through the whole sector. I prefer $SMH over either of these, though I had an individual position in NVDA from 200->300, but got assigned on a covered call I wrote.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 09:34:03'] I've had AMD for 7 years now, I believe its done what I needed. I love it but will sell it in the next few weeks and move on.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 10:49:40'] I missed the NVDA boat last year but managed to buy AMD. I‚Äôve held it ever since and I‚Äôm wondering, is it‚Äôs worth to buy more right now or soon?
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 10:57:15'] I'm a little late to the semiconductors bandwagon (bought some shared earlier this year) and don't know enough about the different companies, so I stick to [SMH](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SMH:NASDAQ).
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 10:58:10'] I‚Äôm optimistic. So it everyone else, so the question is, how much of that optimism is baked in?
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 11:33:49'] Very bullish on both. Bought both at around 40$ and will most likely hold for the rest of my life.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 12:14:22'] NVDA is a hold-it-for-life stock for me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 12:16:54'] I‚Äôd say it definitely depends on your time horizon. Semiconductors are notoriously cyclical. IMO they have good short and long term prospects with a rough patch in medium term. No idea when that‚Äôll be, just a warning if you plans for this money in a few years
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 12:19:47'] I'm in. Nothing but gains

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 16:09:58'] Hedge your bets, both are great options long term
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 16:35:18'] Bought NVDA at $120 and AMD at $11. Sold both this year. I sold them because I needed the money, not because I didn't think they would grow in scale. I think these are two of the leading companies in technology. You will only need more computing and graphical power if everyone wants to build their own meta/omniverse, build their blockchains, and build layers and layers of user interactions in web3. I think about it this way, they're this big primarily because of gaming and ai work/research. In web3, it's more than just users who game or creates ai. The general consumer will be more involved and therefore companies will need greater computation power. There are many software companies; but they'll ultimately be limited to the hardware. And there's only a handful of great hardware companies building chips. At the top are NVDA and AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 16:38:05'] Buy both.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 18:09:33'] Tech is a strange area at the moment. They are in an industry where demand if anything appears to be limitless in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 19:52:32'] It's the world 3.0.NVDA, AMD, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL are keep buying and hold forever. The world can't function without them anymore and that dependency is only going to solidify and expand into profits. Honorable mention to FB, INTEL, ETSY, QCOM, IBM, and other players in that ecosystem, even Roblox. Cell phone dependency/addiction will continue to spread until everyone in the world has one, even in third-world countries. If homeless people in developed countries have smartphones and every grandparent that can't work a computer also have one, it's only a matter of a few years before everyone in the world has one. That means more success for AMZN, GOOGL, FB, and all the players in that ecosystem (NVDA, AMD, INTEL, QCOM, IBM, etc...). Everything is content creation and content consumption, everything revolves around an app, videogames are no longer just for the youth and eventually it will be a huge pastime of senior citizens. The best part is that NVDA and AMD are in the hardware space and that's something that gets obsolete fast and needs to be replaced every few years. Add crypto mining and 3D metaverse, these are tech companies are all winners. I'm putting most of my money into this ecosystem. We are still early into the world 3.0.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-28 20:36:34'] AMD if you‚Äôre looking for growth NVDA if you want to park your money and keep it safe while still making ok gains. The higher risk option here is AMD as they can start going after NVDA market share or give market share back up to Intel in the coming years. NVDA is the safe play, depends how you want to play it. IMO Lisa Su is one of the best CEO‚Äôs I ever researched and that was in 2015 but did not do the same with NVDA so a biased comparison.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 07:24:18'] The stock or the company?  Big difference with these two entities in particular.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 15:33:22'] You can perform a variety of trading and investing strategies depending on what style you are most comfortable with. One can be Swing trading to compound the returns over time. Another one can be pure investing with just shares. If you are looking for a combination of the two or to hedge your risk a bit more you can hold long term shares and do covered calls while swing trading the move itself. The tricky part when combining strategies is making sure they don't affect your core style. Have observed too many investors go to swing trading then day trading and get lost in the styles. Longer term - semiconductors have great prospects and AMD and NVDA are two well known names with some great up and coming projects.

There‚Äôs trillions sitting on the sidelines in money markets looking for appreciation better than single digit returns they are getting.If you‚Äôre a fund manager you won‚Äôt get fired for a bear market, but you will get fired for missing a bull market

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:05:36'] 14 years of QE after GFC allowed zombie companies to exist via easy access to capital. with rising interest rates, the existence of these companies are under threat, while cash rich companies like the tech giants are well insulated and are hence seen as "safe". this along with the AI theme helps explain why big tech is leading so much.That being said, we saw the market get hammered by tons of bad news a couple of months ago. everyone was on the bear wagon. those short positions are being obliterated right now, which helps explain this recent melt up in the market, and a drastic shift in sentiment.But fundamentally, has anything changed? not at all. people constantly make the fallacy of correlating the market with the economy. \*spoiler, they. are. not. the. same.\* druckenmiller figured out the housing bubble in 2004. market hit peak short interest in mid 2007. those shorts got squeezed out after the market continued to rally. sentiment shifted as the market topped, and the shit hit the fan in late 2008. is the recession coming? as sure as there'll be another rainy day. when will it be is anyone's guess. and if anything, if Ray Dalio is right,  people are likely underestimating the severity of the next big one.I'm a nobody and I know next to nothing, but those are my thoughts

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:32:47'] Why does it start in dec 2022 making it an 18 month graph?There is a classic how to lie with statistics fallacy that may be at play here.  If you can select arbitrary start points you can select the slope of perceived gains. It occurred to me because meta is in there and i bought the dip on meta.Meta had this huge covid income surge that swelled it's price followed by a "let's spend billions on vr that nobody wants" (dip) followed by a "thats dumb let's not do that" which resulted in gains. The percentage gain to now can be manipulated a lot by just moving a month or two.  When your list is down to 5 stocks, and one of them is already noted to have that issue, how you selected your start point matters allot to interpretation.Was it selected to maximize the percieved gains of those 5 stocks? If so that is a bias not predictive of future performance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:31:31'] Interesting graph and I think it is even more impressive to consider the more than 100% YTD performance of NVDA, META, and TSLA ‚Äî the first one due to generative AI tailwinds and the other two as bounce backs. If equally weighted the big tech performance will be even greater than the performance of the S&P 500. I think investors see big tech as all-weather stocks with enough cash for a recession and as the leading drivers of growth in our country. Some of the valuations are quite high like NVDA and AMZN, which could very well mean that the rest of the market is significant undervalued.

Nothing abnormal there to me.I think big tech has just been the easy play as markets position for a soft landing, and position themselves for AI. Consolidation becoming more likely.I personally think big tech is the trade of the next decade, so I expect to see a lot of charts like this.At the very least, I don't really see how you get from "some companies are doing great while others are doing a little bit worse than average" to "imminent crash".Also s&p 500 is up closer to 15% year-to-date not 11%.

This is implying that ALL 493 stocks have done nothing other than the big 7. But look under the hood more, Eli Lilly has run a bunch which means some companies have gone down a bunch. There are several of the 493 that are up 20%, there are plenty of companies that are down 20%+. So it‚Äôs just not a great way to look at it in my view.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 23:47:41'] As an AI language model, I cannot directly view or analyze specific graphs or real-time data. However, predicting whether a recession is imminent or not based solely on a single S&P 500 graph is challenging. The S&P 500 index is influenced by various economic factors, [market conditions, and investor sentiment](https://efimarkets.com/), making it difficult to make definitive predictions.    It's important to note that predicting economic cycles and market downturns is a complex task even for experts. Recessionary periods are influenced by a combination of factors such as GDP growth, employment rates, interest rates, geopolitical events, and consumer sentiment, among others.    To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the economic outlook, it is advisable to analyze a wide range of indicators, conduct thorough research, and consider expert opinions. This can help provide a more informed perspective on the likelihood of a recession or potential market trends.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 16:39:21'] Something worth noting that doesnt show in these charts.Alot of the "gaming" profits come from GPU sales, which are down due to changes in the market (economic declines, Ethereum moving away form mining).  This means more GPU's are being sold for gaming purposes.  Many 3rd party vendors that build GPU's using NVDIA chipsets have voiced dissatisfaction working with them because of their "unprofessional" practice's. Might hurt their sales in that sector considering at least one vendor has elected to stop working with them completely.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 08:32:35'] Have had a lot of exposure to analysts over the years and can say with confidence: they don't have the inside scoop, and rarely understand - at a level other than "skin deep" - what is going on in any given company. This includes analysts that follow specific companies for a living.  They know how to read financial statements and ask questions that allow them to fill in cell B13 on their Excel models - but often the questions they ask suggest they're focusing in the "wrong" area, while the answers they're given are so lacking in specificity that even if the question was spot-on, it doesn't inform an insightful answer.  Do your own research.  And if you're not willing to go deep on any one company, go broad on many - index funds or mutual funds to spread risk.   And if you do invest in singular companies/stocks just be prepared for the inevitable highs and lows that follow as you try to outsmart the market.  Cramer was also hot on Theranos and we all know how that ended.   No-one, not even it's A-list celebrity board members, knew what the heck was going on....

It lends itself very well to processing on GPUs, but how big a market share is that really? Any individual idiot can already download Automatic1111 and make AI art all day on his video card at home. Really no need to ugprade. Movie studios will want to use a bunch for this, but that's what, maybe 10,000 cards for every movie studio that needs AI art on the planet. Most of them will farm it out to the cloud where GPU's will be shared by multiple projects. Those already exist, and they are ready to go right now. This won't be anything like the crypto boom they had.

Regarding valuations, it might be worth considering that IoT is just getting started. Most homes, cars, appliances, and whatever else you can think of, are not online. Approximately 35% of the planet is still not fully online in the way that we think of being online in the developed world. What will enable a fully connected world? For the foreseeable future it is silicon chips. They will enable functionality and intelligence in everything. Betting on chip designers and manufacturers over the long term will be a safe investment. Short term fluctuations are inevitable as are the long term gains in this sector. Something else worth mentioning is the quality of NVDA as a company. They hire the absolute best and have a culture that supports them. Try plucking an NVDA employee to go and work for another company, they will tell you thanks but no thanks. This company is like no other.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-02 07:04:04'] Right path bro. I think this is a good time to buy stocks amidst the Coronavirus pandemic.The formation of a new ecosystem will take time. In this scenario, some years will be required before a robust economy emerges. However, the market is most likely oversold globally right now. Oil adjusted for inflation is back to levels not seen since the height of Iran-Iraq war in 1986‚Äì87. That world though not known by most traders, is worth revisiting, the savings from low cost energy does help the economy recover in a meaningful way.Been trying to shift my attention in several market like crypto too since I have been seeing companies that holds a lot of potential like BTCS. Anyway, this will bring back a level of prosperity to more people than the last three recoveries. The idea of a jobless recovery will not not be the case this time. If an investor has a window period of longer than than months or even a few years, than there is nothing wrong in investing now. But, if the goals are short term, it may well be better to wait until stability returns. Recoveries often witness a traders market before stability comes once more. What is certain is that the world is not ending, and a mysterious illnesses will pass. The likely results will be fortunes which are lost and others which will be made.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 08:02:45'] Everything IS FINE, but that could change eventually when the unemployment starts going up. Let‚Äôs face it, no one cares about a POSSIBLE recession, or higher interest rates unless you are building new homes, or can‚Äôt pay your rent. There‚Äôs 96.6 percent of people walking around with money in their pockets, good jobs, health insurance, and wanting a vacation.  The retired are happy with their large raise in SS in January.  Food prices and building new homes have come down considerably from those detrimental high prices.    The headlines are not bad; those who talk about a recession and  everyone looks around and says, ‚ÄúWhat recession?‚Äù and go out to dinner or go enjoy their lives while the Fed wrings it‚Äôs hands and the markets go up because after all, ‚ÄúWhat recession.‚Äù  No one will change their attitudes and stop or slow their spending until they have the pain. How do Americans get the pain?  Layoffs, plenty of layoffs so lots of Americans feel the pinch. It‚Äôs not a problem if you can get another job right away. You may have to change your lifestyle but  as long as you got ‚Äúrent money‚Äù you are fine.      So the truth is, will the Fed cause the pain? They want unemployment at 4.6 percent ( and maybe interest rates at 6%? ) and aren‚Äôt getting their way. As long as people don‚Äôt feel the pain everything IS FINE.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 21:35:11'] The argument of course is NVDA can increase revenues.Their recent statement came out and said that they expected significantly higher revenues.The difference between Sun and NVDA is NVDA has the market. They have a tonne of orders in for their product and they are way ahead of the competition in a massively growing field.Ive seen big funds calulating that at future earnings in 5 years time their current P/E is 1.5. So if the P/E held they would make a lot of money on NVDA at the se prices.Add to this NVDA is decoupled from the company ita a bet on AI at this point. Just like BTC and block chain. BTC didnt do anything that wasnt done better by something else. But it was the embodiment of investing in block chain technology.In saying all that I am not buying NVDA at the current price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 02:41:15'] "NVDA is overvalued, you should buy value stocks" isn't a good argument. Mostly because cheap stocks in relations to assets and earnings are in businesses where returns on capital are low, and it requires selling them for new cheap stocks once they've appreciated. It can be done, but I'd much rather be part of a business with good economics that can be held for a longer period of time. Fun fact - the S&P growth and value index have very similar revenue growth rates. Growth has outperformed for a decade because it has vastly higher returns on capital. They are better businesses because they require less investment to grow, even if the growth is slow.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:32:28'] "significant time periods in which you will underperform the market (e.g. 2010-2021)."Yeah, and that correlates with money printing. In case of abundant cheap money fundamentals don't matter, only speculation, hype and moonshots. I think the market is still in this mindset, and either 1) there will be a rude awakening and realisation that money is no longer that cheap, and reality still matters (if Fed follows through with what they say) or 2) We're back to money printing, hype bonanza, and even more inequality

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-21 05:44:33'] What part of AI are you in ? Do you use any of their products beyond hardware e.g. any of their frameworks (Metropolis, Clara, Riva, Merlin,  Maxine, Isaac).Significant part of the growth for Nvidia is expected  to come from the AI software side, so if you are in the industry you may be able to get an edge on the adoption of these products.Currently the stock is pricing in very little for software as they just started announcing these products in the past year +. But I think could be few 100 billion opportunity. I wrote a quick report on it - may be useful esp. if you know the products and have an opinion[https://spear-invest.com/nvidia-the-one-stop-ai-shop/](https://spear-invest.com/nvidia-the-one-stop-ai-shop/)MSFT sounds like a solid investment too but I would not sell Nvidia here  to buy MSFT.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-21 07:55:40'] Never ever put >15% value single stock into your total portfolio.  Always diversifty to different industries to reduce risk one industry's volatility.I went to IBM annual stock share holder meeting long ago.  A frail older lady challenged the CEO who was Lou Gershner at the time. As a widow of a retiree her busband devoted 47 years with the company bought  employee purchase and their life saving with IBM. She lived on dividends which were stopped. Stock valuation was a fraction what it was worth.  Tears rolled out and the CEO promised he will resume payout as soon as permissible.She is actually lucky by today's standards. Husband had a pension and they received above average dividends every month.  Today, few private employers will want to have them around. They can hire young ones for less.  There is no pension. Many investors even question why tech companies want to pay a dividend as it is not a common practice anymore.Again,  always diversifty investment to spread out the total portfolio. Invest in companies that people need and investors understand. Stay with those that will be around.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 10:02:04'] I sold numerous times over the last several years. I stopped messing with it once it got over $300. Though I regret it, I still think the stock is an inflated bubble.I have no clue how some people get some of these projections. NVDA needs serious growth to reach the value that people are anticipating, which it is doing. Though, I don't know how long it can continue it's projected growth. By investing in NVDA, you are investing in the fact that they stay at the forefront of developing chips for gaming, AI, cloud computing, and crypto mining - and that such markets continue to grow significantly.NVDAs dividends are at a minor 0.10% yield right now. All investors are investing in is the hope of selling it at a higher price in the future, or one day they start paying serious dividends. Paying a decent dividend would require their earnings to significantly grow. The P/E ratio is insane. For significant growth, the P/E ratio either needs to continue climbing to insane heights from all the optimism, or the company somehow expand their market presence, which is hard considering they are at the forefront of it.I love NVDA, it was my first investment, bought at $53 per share. I've missed out on some serious financial gain because I've sold it a few years back. It has been one of the fastest growing stocks for a while now. Though, that growth seems to be mostly in it's P/E ratio. Whether you hold/buy/sell is up to you, just know that there is a lot of optimism riding it's current price.Currently, there are better soltions to crypto currency mining than GPUs, but the price for the alternative solutions are much higher. If competition prices were to drop, NVDA could face some losses. GPU prices have also significantly increased, and many are on back order. I'm curious if GPU prices will drop soon, and if new chip manufacturers will rise up to compete with NVDA because of all the silicone chip growth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 08:30:28'] You are just cherry-picking which companies to compare the market cap with. While I agree that Nvidia's market cap is higher than of other chip makers combined, your combination of chip makers is purposely ignoring big chip makers (e.g. TSMC and Samsung who combined have a greater market cap than Nvidia). By your logic, I can just say that the GDP of Somalia (7,293 billion) is higher than that of more than 5 countries combined (Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands). While this argument is true, it fails to take into consideration the difference in size of these countries and purposefully neglects other countries who have a similar GDP to Somalia, thus presenting a distorted image that overinflates the image of Somalia.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:42:44'] So you believe that AI will enhance profits without replacing jobs?  Or do you believe that AI will make business more efficient by replacing jobs.  Personally the way I see it AI is a real thing and it is important and integral to advancing our future in many ways, however I also believe this is a bubble, because in the end companies will look to use AI to increase efficiency, and that will likely lead to job losses. Unless we as a society can come up with other jobs for the masses that get displaced then this technology will be like shooting yourself in the foot; because without jobs and income our economy and the profits of our public companies is unsustainable.Best of luck, but I do believe this will return to the mean.

I agree that AI can change the world, but you might be too early in thinking it's going to change this now. And in investing, being too early and being wrong is the same thing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 19:26:28'] Solid plan.  I wouldn't limit it to 1 CC in total.  1 per 100 shares.  Just stagger them so you never have all of them exp on the same date.  Sell on big green days and always leave a couple close to exp and some un covered so you have a couple to sell when they are way up.  Buy back CC on down days.  I frequently set a trailing stoploss on my CC once they hit 50% profit at like 10 to 20% of the remaining value to account for volatility.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 05:29:56'] Any fool investing in MCD's now deserves what is coming.    I stopped at two of them three Sundays ago to try to order three egg biscuits for breakfast.    Sat in the first one's drive through line for seven minutes, then at the speaker for five - nobody was taking orders. I drove around and waited at for the car ahead of me to get its change (that took a LONG time). Most people kept leaving the line to give up on it, but I got to the window and ordered. Except that I didn't ... "we don't have egg biscuits" is what I was told. What he meant was that there wasn't a button for that, or that he couldn't find one - so he was just going to charge me for bacon egg and cheese biscuits and then throw away the bacon and cheese, but of course charge me $13.XX for the privilege. He even checked with the manager, and that was the best they could come up with for one of the most common items they sell.    So I left, and made it to another McD's before breakfast ended. This time I walked in. I was NOT ready for what I walked in to, though. Eight of the most unhappy people - who had already ordered - were waiting for their food. Then I looked around me; the tables that had people in them ALSO had no food.    The service and quality of McD's has dropped off like a rock into a lake. I wasted 45 minutes across two McD's and ended up with no food to show for it.    McD's has to be losing clients left and right. Nobody in their right mind would wait 20 minutes for McD's food AFTER having had to wait 10 minutes, or more, to order it.    McD's old promise of "If you don't get your order in five minutes or less, your order is free" promise is gone.

If you look at the inverse yield curve ( long term bonds have a lower yield than short term bonds) you may lessen your exposure to stocks in the next year. If the PE ratio of the entire market is lower now that it has been in the last 30 years you may want to increase your stock holdings.However, I doubt that that making such adjustments to your portfolio will really help you. It is almost impossible to correctly time the market. I know that these statements will not hold you back. They do not even hold me back.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 22:09:51'] My only concern is that you do not really break down the main technological offerings of either Intel or AMD. This may be something that you assume we know and just leave it out for simplicity sake, but a technology company needs to be analyzed by its technology.Investors made a similar mistake to the one listed above over the last five years in Intel. Investors rely solely on the financials and ignore the underlying technologies of the business. Some things that should be considered are:1. TSMC is generations ahead of Intel in manufacturing processes2. Intel's main direct competitors use TSMC3. Intel and AMD utilize x86 chip architecture which is at a disadvantage in lower power devices such as laptops when compared to x64 ARM chips4. Intel's offerings are technologically inferior to AMD and Nvidia's offerings in datacenters5. IDM 2.0 is a massive financial risk for Intel and is utilizing billions in capital investment a yearI think there is much more qualitative research that would need to be conducted to definitively make a conclusion on these businesses

Some of them went back down and are at the beginning, so 0% profit in those stocks now. How do you deal with that? Do you set an alarm when the stock goes up 30% you sell, or how do you do it?

POST_TEXT: b'Started investigating INTC and some competitors to form a strategy and in doing so found some conflicting info. \n\nLooked at some long term stock forecasts from CNN Money on both companies here:\n\n[INTC Forecast](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=intc)\n\n[NVDA Forecast](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=NVDA)\n\nGiven the current climate surrounding semiconductors I figured NVDA would be a good play mid to long term; however, it seems that analysts expect the stock price to reduce to roughly 235.0 over the next 12 months. \n\nOn the other hand, the opposite is expected for INTC with the price hitting somewhere in the range of 55.0 to 80.0. \n\nI fully expected NVDA to rise in value and same with INTC for that matter. Is INTC undervalued and NVDA overvalued? Also, is any of CNN Moneys analysis valuable?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 12:54:38'] These are both risky because they have a lot of expectations built in. For example, the price rise that NVDA got out of the ARM acquisition announcement presumes that they intend to behave in a monopolistic way, and can squeeze that market without vendors switching to RISC-V. And that the won't receive any significant regulatory response. Otherwise, the acquisition price makes no financial sense at all, it is just tossing money out the window. INTC has similar problems. People are bullish because they're building a fab. When they tried to contract out use of their existing fabs in the past, they did very poorly at it; they were greedy, they were unwilling to offer competitive prices. And when people wouldn't pay a premium just to have the honor of being their customer, they discontinued the service instead of lowering prices. And they made a lot of excuses about what had happened.Basically none of that is going to find its way into either technical or fundamental analysis. That is why I don't touch either of these stocks, and I prefer companies like AMD, AMAT, and even IBM. (What I like about IBM is that the bear case has been very popular, everybody can say something bad about them, and yet they're doing a great job of integrating their AI tools with the cloud and providing quality APIs to developers; and they're doing that while maintaining high margins and large revenue)

POST_TEXT: b'The global semi-conductor shortage, aka chip shortage, has been crippling many industries. Demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply and the car industry is longer the only one feeling the pain. Many auto-makers are actually limiting the amount of cars produced in 2021, including Ford recently who announced they will be canceling weeks worth of production of the F-150.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThere are a few factors at play giving analysts the impression that this shortage may last until early 2022. Theres a few KEY points that come to mind:\n\n* Most chips are produced overseas: Covid-related delays in shipping ports have effected supply coming into the United States.\n* China has been stock-piling chips: Chinese businesses have bought an absurd amount of chip-producing equipment (roughly $32 billion) in an effort to protect themselves from further US sanctions.\n* Demand for electronic products have soared.\n* Often over-looked, consumers dont realize the amount of chips it takes to buil'

POST_TEXT: b'Stock: Nvidia\n\nTicker: $NVDA\n\n**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** \n\nTo begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, lets use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the companys average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\n\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companys shares.\n\nSo we have nvidias equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billio'
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 21:34:57'] The Ev/Ebida I found was 21x so Nvda is WAY overvalued.Also Nvda hit over $225 since split which is over $900 presplit beating the old ath.I would love to own Nvda after it drops 20% plus.It is 3x its pre- covid price and 4.5x it's covid bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 21:38:44'] nvidia is a semiconductor. so the avg ev/ebitda is 21 so it‚Äôs actually overvalued. other than that, i mean it‚Äôs fine for your first dd.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 23:04:00'] Look at PEG it's simpler and summarizing metric. NVDA is already expensive and with the current instability in the market I would not buy but I'd hold
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 01:22:31'] Risk for Nvidia at the moment is the ARM deal. Nvidia faces opposition from the EU as concessions made do not go far enough to mitigate damage to rivals
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 05:35:16'] This is like reading something you‚Äôd hand in for high school. And you don‚Äôt mention the ARM deal which could totally make or break the momentum forward. You do however mention crypto miners as GPU purchasers but you miss mentioning AI development which is expected to become NVIDIAs and the worlds most important tech this decade.And key ratios are available at every financial site in the world, there is no need to spend half your analysis focusing on one of them and base your whole thesis on it. End of the day only cash flows matter.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 05:53:21'] I have found that investors who follow a discipline, even a bad one, tend to do better than those who react to any market reversal.  Pick the tools that best fit your risk profile and ignore the rest.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 10:47:07'] The only criticism I can give is the fact you said ‚ÄúI can see Nvidia moving in two different ways‚Ä¶‚Äù, In the stock market world this means nothing because there are only two ways a stock can move.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 02:04:39'] semiconductor industry is cyclical. The GPUs that have been sold in the past year might end up in the used card markets and hurt the sale of new cards in 2023 and 2024. Ether mining with GPU is not going to be profitable forever. The current price assumes that Nvidia is going to have exponential growth for several years. See what happened in 2018 to NVDA.  But the company is good and the CEO is a literal stable genius so I would say this is a good long term investment. I personally would not buy at the moment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:11:42'] The stock market is a marketplace where publicly traded companies' stocks are bought and sold. When a company wants to raise money, it can do so by issuing stocks, which are shares of ownership in the company. Investors can then buy these stocks, becoming part owners of the company. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand in the market, with the price rising as more people want to buy the stock and falling as more people want to sell. The stock market can be a good way for companies to raise money and for investors to make money, but it also involves risk as the value of stocks can fluctuate widely.

Intel, comfortable with its dominating market share, was stagnant essentially making minor upgrades to their product lines each cycle. AMD took advantage of this by heavily investing in new chip architecture, creating a better product, and taking share away from Intel. NVDA was similar to Intel in that it‚Äôs 20 series GPUs was a minor upgrade from the 10 series. NVDA saw what AMD did to Intel, knew AMD was designing a new GPU, so they responded with huge upgrades in the 30 series. Intel has provided their innovation roadmap showing it‚Äôll be back to making competitive products in 2022. AMD will continue to innovate with its chip architecture; it hasn‚Äôt competed with NVDA in terms of GPU value performance, but it has come pretty close. AMD‚Äôs next GPU line could go toe-to-toe with NVDA‚Äôs next line.tl;dr, AMD has been a catalyst for innovation by becoming a real competitor against NVDA and Intel. All 3 companies will continue to innovate and make substantial upgrades to their product lines; each doesn‚Äôt want to be left behind, especially Intel.

SPY was in a classic megaphone pattern. You have a tendency to over-parallel your lines. Parallels are the best structures to trade but only if they are accurate.It ended up not making a huge difference in SPY this round. But in the 1970s it mattered a lot. 1970s was all about the megaphone, for a decade.

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-11 17:04:18'] Nvidia is still ahead of AMD in the GPU space. However, AMD has been starting to close the gap, but they still don't have a product that can compete with Nvidia in the high end.With that said, AMD has been destroying the CPU segment, which is what saved the company. I can only imagine them growing even more in that department.Also, Intel is starting to jump into the GPU market, so Nvidia will have another competitor. With AMD leading the CPU segment, and another competitor entering the GPU arena, I see more upside for AMD business-wise.Now if you're talking about the stock, even if AMD might have a better chance for better growth as a business, you could argue that that growth is already priced in the stock (which is what I believe). Intel is the one with the lowest PE ratio, and frankly the only one with a dividend (I don't count Nvidia's low yield lol), but again growth is much more important than dividend in that segment of the market. AMD is the one with the highest PE ratio, and Nvidia is in the middle.If I had to bet on one of them for the next 5 years, I'll put my money on Intel because they are the one with the lowest PE ratio by far, plus they are entering in the GPU area, plus they have the cash to catch back to AMD. AMD has great growth, but also high risk (if Lisa Su leaves it's probably gg), and it's highly valued currently.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-28 22:28:02'] I know I am coming from an uncommon niche position, but I am personally boycotting Nvidia until they make an effort to improve their Linux support.  I'll admit, their GPUs are top notch. However, the support is terrible; you either have to use reverse engineered drivers that are horrible, or use proprietary firmware blobs that are out of date and under-maintained.  This is not the case for AMD GPUs, where the open source drivers are known to work at least as well as the proprietary drivers. This is because AMD actively develops open source drivers with the community to allow for better support.Again, this is a niche position, but I know I am not alone.  If I see a laptop I am interested and see it has an nVidia GPU, I immediately turn away.  I feel really bad for people who want to use Linux but cannot because of the needless stumbling block that comes with getting the nVidia GPUs to work.  All the while, the screen constantly tears or will not display graphics whatsoever.  This is such a disheartening experience.I just bring this up to you guys as a fellow investor enthusiast.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 18:49:16'] Unfortunately, strongly disagree. Buying AMD here is high risk low reward. Did you look at their last earnings report? Revenues slowing, margins down and guidance is not so strong. It was a buy in the $60s, sell in the $90s. The AI hype is still very speculative and one negative catalyst will send both NVDA and AMD tumbling down.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 05:08:48'] Here is the paper.   https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433It is worth a read.  Basically they found that switching using 100% optical uses a ton less power.  So instead of converting, switching, and converting back.   Google instead keep it optical and have mirrors that are physically moved to change connections.It does need to be longer life connections as it takes almost a second to realign each time to switch the connection paths.This is a pretty big deal.   Ultimately there is a cost to run large language models like Bard and ChatGPT, etc.     The cost is over 100x of using a traditional search engine that at the core uses Backrub/Page Rank.   This paper is really dated but so much more true today than ever before.  Google was really smart to start preparing for today 8 years ago with the development of the TPUs.  I think this is a place Microsoft has really made a mistake in not doing the same and dependent on Nvidia.https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/I do love that Google shares this stuff.  I am retired now and a lot of free time but get a real charge out of learning.  But I think from an investment standpoint Google really should not be so generous.   But I guess they find it is worth it because it helps them attract the best talent.    Top talent want to share things.  I think this is a big reason Apple does so poorly when it comes to AI.

POST_TEXT: b'Why? It exceeded expected earnings by far, but still falls ~3%?'
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-10 15:24:19'] The stock shot up in anticipation of good earnings (11% over the last few days). In other words, it already increased substantially from an expected good earnings report. In order for it to increase more from a good earnings report, the report would have had to be ridiculously good. It‚Äôs earnings were good, but not good enough to justify the 11% increase. So it adjusted in the  after hours

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-10 15:52:03'] I want to know if result is enough to move the general tech/overall market tomorrow? We've had such a nice green week.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-10 16:29:45'] Others are mentioning market sentiment  or fundamental factors:  weather because of the over-buying prior to earnings or less than desired p/e respectively. However, I'm the doofus telling you it's actually the technical factors, and all these lamo-s are lost. I think there is a false notion that tech is very safe as an industry. * * *The same thing used to be thought of a lot of the commodities, and then it was thought of real estate, and then it was thought of financials, and then real estate again, and then motor vehicles, and then it was kinda all up in the air for a while, **but** now we have the tech industry that is a "safe bet no matter what"--sort of cloud9 honeypot stock sector. I heard guys telling folks to split 50/25/25 on sector etfs, NVDA, AND this week. That's a really scary sign considering we haven't seen tech respond to much sector wide negative news yet, such as if Intel's 10nm process isn't a possibility, or if AMD EPYC chips don't actually do anything, or if Nvidia just *doesn't have* a lineup for after the 10xx series. I'm not saying there aren't other good manufacturers, and I'm not saying that we should all drink the Jonestown punch just because they did something weird around earnings--after an infinite green stretch. I'm just noting that there could be other factors, but I am not worried about it, NVDA will keep on keepin on. * * *[Here is an investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp) article  describing the differences in technical factors, fundamental factors, and market sentiment.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 07:56:21'] My thought is you should‚Äôve listened to your uncle.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 09:21:37'] They have just announced their new RTX 30xx series of PC graphics cards.If the release later this month validates their claims these will set a new milestone in terms of compute power at a highly competitive price point.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 09:22:57'] The recent price soar was due to new ampere gpus. But everyone uses their gpus. Just watched the new mercedes s-class release today, they said the car has 3 nvidia gpus. Their tech is everyone and no one is competing
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 14:33:45'] Nvidia is a very solid company. As to continual growth, who knows, but they‚Äôre the market leader without much question now.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 12:44:00'] Ask your uncle about other stocks/companies used by his employer.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 10:25:32'] If you‚Äôve got years ahead, I think NVDA is a good long term play. I just added to my position not that long ago and am happy to see it continue to grow. I feel like it‚Äôs a set it and forget it position.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-04 03:12:46'] Nvidia is (one of) the most important tech companies out there.They have the strongest consumer graphics card and that's all nice and well,but more importantly they do a lot of AI tech and Cloud Computing.While the market adjusted yesterday (after alot of hype around Nvidia), in the long run it can only go up,atleast until some signficant change in the company or their working fields (which probably would take years to decades).
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 15:38:26'] I'm new to NVDA. I was able to free up some cash and purchased some shares just a few weeks ago when it was $500. Today its trading $570s! I'm planning on holding this because of the possibility of acquiring ARM and further growth in its data center business. I would suggest looking for reports and info on that side of its operations. ARM acquisition would be a catalyst for a gap up.But, this stock has risen so sharply that a pull back is probably due (whenever THE pull back occurs). I may try and swing trade this if I am able to. Regardless, I agree this seems like a good long hold stock with room for definite growth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 06:46:09'] Nah...  I think we will be range bound/sideways from here for a while.  I doubt we make new lows unless unemployment starts rising.  We won't make new highs until the macroeconomic situations improve (inflation subsiding, FED cutting, economy growing at a higher rate).  This will probably a long way off though. The recent market catalysts have not been as bad a feared. Markets priced in worse.  Many of the speculative bubble stocks and tech have basically crashed.  You look at some of these charts and all the 2020-2022 gains are gone. Now there are fair buying opportunities in a lot of these beaten down names and money has been rotating into them. Catalysts:Small FED rate hikesSlowing but not contracting economy Slowing inflationLow unemploymentEarnings falling but not as much as feared.

One of the most important lessons any investor can learn is to stay invested, even during market downturns. It can be tempting to sell off your investments and sit on the sidelines when the market takes a hit, but this is often the worst thing you can do. Instead, it's crucial to stay the course and stick to your investment strategy.\n\nHistory has shown that the stock market is cyclical, and downturns are a natural part of the cycle. While it can be painful to see your investments lose value, it's important to remember that these downturns are typically short-lived. In fact, many of the most significant market gains have occurred in the years following a market crash. By staying invested, you give yourself the opportunity to benefit from these gains and achieve yo"

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 09:58:29'] I stay invested as I only invest in strong stocks that I understand. Simple things such as food, water, paper tissue, glasses, computer peripherals, consumer goods, pharmaceuticals. These things will always be needed. And as long as the fundamental data remains in the green, I will not sell a single stock. My portfolio has a low correlation amongst the stocks and is diversified across the globe. This resistance makes me sleep good at night.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 23:39:57'] Ridiculous. A catastrophic crash of 70% or more requires a 300% gain to get your money back.  And it's happened more than once.  You can hold through a correction, but not a major crash.  And if the crash happens at or in retirement, you are screwed.  Use common sense and invest responsibly. If it made multimillionaires out of the average investor, why are so many people poor?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 05:25:07'] You are right, there is still too much money in the system which postpones the recession once again
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:52:55'] My opinion is hard disagree.  I haven't seen truly bearish sentiment at all.  People who have been investing for a few years can't recognize bearishness, they seem to think anything slightly negative but true is a "bearish talking point" or "doomsday conspiracy theories."  People cherry pick parts of earnings calls and Jerome speeches and ignore anything slightly negative.  People are complaining out one side of their mouth about not being able to afford life despite having a good job then out the other side screech at anyone who hints a recession is coming is a conspiracy theorist.I have a watch list of close to 200 stocks and none are undervalued right now.  That is almost unprecedented. During "normal" times, a random amount, maybe 10-20% will be in a dip for either no reason or for a made up reason (such as articles that Amazon will enter so and so industry). That's how I made money.  I would think, is there a reason this good company is cheap, not find one, buy it, and it would go up in 6 months.  Now, every darn this is overpriced. Boomer dividend low growth stocks. Tech stocks. Old falling apart used cars in the middle of nowhere.  Dumpy houses in the middle of nowhere in need of expensive repairs.  The economic situation is actually worse in 2008 in the sense that then, broke people bought houses they had no business buying. Now 6-figure earners are struggling to afford basics.I'm also seeing loads of "Q4 earnings was bad but we're raising or keeping high guidance" comments in earnings calls which has me scratching my head.  Do people actually believe all of this? And I'm also never lived through so much skewing of earnings calls.  Like, the market and investors used to just take lower earnings and bad guidance at face value. I also really wish people grasped the "just because someone beat expectations doesn't mean earnings are up" concept.Bear markets end when people who buy "real" companies (not bankrupt companies, not 20 year old tech companies with PEs of 200) get scared and stop buying the freaking dip for two seconds.  I'm watching all of these stocks and the market won't let them drop more than a few percent points. This used to only happen in roaring bull markets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 17:39:09'] We have bottomed, for now. Building up bubbles is bullish. Since we hit the bottom savings have gone down for americans but not for the China, which has gone up.So what is really happening? A alternating series of kicking it down the road, masking of indications, and mini bubble ruptures.However, dollar milkshake theory and the everything bubble exists. As traders, we shouldn‚Äôt be bullish or bearish. Government intervention is not only the reason for the crash but also the reason it doesn‚Äôt crash. Everybody has reason to be bullish or bearish. The market ‚Äúpriced everything in‚Äù is not real. Every bubble is bound to pop eventually so it should go down right? Since it‚Äôs forward looking‚Ä¶..Newsflash, it‚Äôs forward looking to ‚Äúa degree‚Äù. If JPOW says anything other than 25 bps, the market will react, which isn‚Äôt pricing in shit. Even with 25 bps, the market will probably dip. Just because of the mechanics of strengthening the dollar and the algos selling in reaction. If JPOW is dovish, go bullish, if he hawkish, go bearish. Mainly because the economic phenomenon is difficult for anyone to wrap their heads around completely (I‚Äôm studying all the time and keep getting conflicting signals). It is very likely JPOW will screw this up by either being too hawkish or dovish and will overshoot. Just don‚Äôt fight  ‚ÄúTHE MARKETS PERCEPTION OF FED‚Äù. JPOW very commonly ‚Äúspooks‚Äù the market, and the market moves in tandem with JPOW, only for them to, at some random point of good news, start fighting the fed and moving in the opposite directions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 18:27:44'] LOL anything is possible but methinks the market is gonna make a new low below the Oct 13 bottom.The economy is strong, which is inflationary. Even if the economy was to fall into recession the federal reserve will NOT jump in to stem the tide because a recession will bring inflation down. Rates will have to keep going higher and this makes safer investments more appealing and stocks less attractive. ZIRP isn't coming back. Looking at all the facts, it's difficult not to be bearish on equities, which are still due for a reckoning.Equity investors are fighting the fed and that never ends well.

But the current situation is nothing like those. 2008 was a flash boom a deep and severe recession. We got out of it with 12 years of QE. Now QE is the last thing the fed will think about.

Inexperienced retail traders bite the hand that feeds. Bear in mind that we can all thank these absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing from the Fed as a reason crypto and the stock market exploded after March of 2020 in the first place. The stock market literally doubled in less than 2 years. It would be a complete policy error mistake to not scale that delusional overvalued BS down a bit.

POST_TEXT: b'Big Short fame investor Michael Burry said U.S. House Of Representatives Speaker **Nancy Pelosi** made a bundle on semiconductor stocks she recently purchased because she knew a key bill would make it through the Senate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d5eockv91yc91.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92ae0fe06d94be578b89aeb36b75d9d5760aace8\n\nWhat Happened: Burry made his comments on Twitter on Wednesday. He said tagging the Democrat politician, So Speaker Pelosi made a bundle on semiconductor stocks bought recently. Should be illegal.\n\nBurry also shared a news report on the Senate passing a bipartisan bill, which would subsidize domestic semiconductor production with a $52 billion support. \n\nSource: [https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/07/28145000/big-short-fame-investor-michael-burry-says-nancy-pelosis-semiconductor-stock-buy-shouldnt-be-legal](https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/07/28145000/big-short-fame-investor-michael-burry-says-nancy-pelosis-semiconductor-stock-buy-shouldnt'
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 09:35:02'] So easy to mitigate something like this:* You and your spouse cannot purchase individual stocks or options while you are serving in Congress. Only index funds.* Term limits. There shouldn't be a reason for career politicians. If you can do the job, you don't need 30+ years to prove so.* After your term limit, you are prevented from owning individual stocks for a one-year period.These three simple things would prevent the majority of abuse. You won't prevent them all as Nancy can easily gossip to her wealthier friends but something like that would be impossible to forcibly prevent. If you're a politician who is 'serving the public', investing in stocks shouldn't be a priority for you as it has been for Nancy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 22:32:33'] This is worse than traditional insider trading. Let‚Äôs compare. With a single company divulging inside (non-public) information it hurts those that invest with that single company while this person or family prosper. With lawmakers they directly approve regulations that make or break businesses. They do so with entire industries. This is done at the detriment to all taxpayers for the benefit of the same single person or family. Their vote is not public information. It may be known or assumed. But essentially private.No individual stocks should be allowed for purpose and all traded should be restricted to C-suite restrictions. Filed far in advance. Etc. etc.

Him commenting on what should be legal or not should be considered with the same credulity as Chris Hemsworth commenting on the validity of a Viking artifact. 2. That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs wrong, just that he‚Äôs not an expert or the end all be all opinion on things. 3. Nancy Pelosi didn‚Äôt make these buys. Her husband, who was doing pretty well in funds before she got elected, did. If you think they‚Äôre getting together each night to compare notes and strategize, I‚Äôd invite you to consider how much time you think either of them have. 4. The evidence of corruption isn‚Äôt the act- it‚Äôs the uniqueness of the act. If everyone was buying the stock, then everyone was buying the stock. If he was the *only* one buying the stock, then it‚Äôs suspicious. But what we have here is someone who is only famous because they were portrayed in a movie making an accusation without much supporting evidence against a person who is only known because of their spouse. And you all are using that to defend the the things you already believe- which is the definition of confirmation bias.

I wonder how many republicans profited off of knowing that bill wouild pass?       I don't see anyone talking about them.   And while we are at it, lets examine ALL of the insider trading done by EVERYONE in BOTH houses of congress asn see if we can't find a way to get them subject to the law again

As far as paying them more, no.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 09:04:07'] The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn‚Äôt fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don‚Äôt realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.       This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out.

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 10:36:05'] I'm extremely long Nvidia. My POV is that fluctuating chip sales now does not really matter in the long term. GPUs will always be needed in servers, workstations, research stations, self-driving cars, VR, AR, consoles and gaming. Unless AMD can suddenly come in with an updated node that rivals Nvidia in efficiency and computing power, Nvidia will not be threatened. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 10:24:58'] You‚Äôd have to know what their earnings are going to be to really make a sound decision. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 11:54:46'] I‚Äôm long NVDA, have been for over a year now. Definitely up over 100%.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 17:23:36'] Long forever on NVDA. GPUs are going no where.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 11:54:51'] Of course.All this non sense of crypto weakness.. "graphic chips are doomed" was all bogus attempts to instill fear among investors. It may be true long term for sure... but not at the moment. But boy did the fear deliver by giving us this great entry point of $225. I sold when the panic started \(options trader, gotta capitalize on dips\) and decided to wait until closer to earnings for a better entry point.  I bought around $219. The current price is as good as any going in to earnings. AMD already demonstrated that cards are selling plentiful \(even though AMD is an after thought for most buyers if they cant find Nvidia. Like settling for a BBW when nothing better is available\).The other issue was the AI in self driving cars... even with the deaths that has caused panic. This is still inevitably where we are going as a society and companies will go to NVDA for powerful chips that support this tech. \(so long term this is nothing to worry about, self driving car deaths will not compare to what drunk drivers have achieved already\). Other than that, whats not to like? Gaming industry's golden age continues to explode, graphic arts \(image/video/and more recently 3D art\) continues to grow & Crypto is a nice addition.I personally will sell post earnings. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 15:28:05'] I think it'd depend on which price it'd close at before earnings. If it rallied before earnings announcement and is -10% or less off top, then most likely it'd sell off. Why? This is how market behaves in this volatile time. AMZN, NFLX and others, despite beating estimates left and right, they sold off quickly and were capped off from (breaking out) to new ATHs. In a nutshell, it's random where stocks, NVDA in this case, go after earnings announcement. Earnings play is purely gambling. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 16:03:35'] I think so, I own some NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 23:56:50'] Nvidia is valuable partially because they make the best GPU hardware, but more importantly imo because of their CUDA programming interface that can be leveraged to run all sorts of general programming and data science related tasks. In the below Wikipedia page it shows that CUDA is by far the main supported GPU interface for deep leaning frameworks, so most all of these programs have to be run on Nvidia gpus. And especially if you want to remain flexible with whatever framework you‚Äôre using you‚Äôll use Nvidia gpus so you can change frameworks with ease. And oh, want your computations to run ten times as fast? Buy ten times as many gpus.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep_learning_software

	COMMENT: ['2016-12-27 09:59:41'] It's a result of the efficiency of GPUs for massively parallel computation.  Eventually GPUs will be inside every car, server, laptop, and any product which will rely on neural net AI.  This represents a completely new emerging market for GPUs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 01:31:13'] Nvidia will be a massive winner long term, computer sales and prices are collapsing, you should see the deals at Walmart on older laptop chips. These companies made too many computer chips. Once they sell or destroy all this excess inventory Nvidia will be fine.High end graphics chips and high computer chips aren't going anywhere and the margins these companies can generate when the supply is under control is incredible.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 04:50:17'] There is a two part answer to this: Short term: you are probably looking at a further decline of anywhere from 15-30%. Interest rate hikes won‚Äôt stop this year so tech stocks will get beaten up. The China export ban is also doing its thing like many others have already pointed out. Long term: computer chips and graphic cards are one of the most important if not the most important component to everything regarding AI as well as everything regarding renewable energies like solar-parks wind-parks. These will be the main drivers of revenue and demand is rising rapidly. Will Nvidia be the market leader? I don‚Äôt know. Will they play an important role? I‚Äòm sure they will. If you are unsure about the trade relations between the US and China maybe have a look into other companies that offer similar products from other countries
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 04:57:54'] Nvidia is going through a transitory earnings decline, but the company's revenue growth and earnings should recover sooner than later. The company is a solid long-term investment, and the company's stock should be considerably higher several years from now.

I'd target a price of $75 by mid 2023.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 04:51:23'] Probably going lower. Excluding all of the speculation on trading, I'll try to put on display what I see right now. Nv has four main markets: gaming, products for ai computation, professional graphics, virtual currency mining. It made huge profits in the last few years mostly thanks to the mining and ai markets, and used the chip shortage issues to try to establish higher pricing baselines. Now what it got is: currency mining market dipping, and even selling out their former, still current-gen cards. Ai market shrinking as well, with competition coming even from unexpected players such as Google and Aws. Gaming is taking advantage of stocks being sold from mining operations, or waiting for prices to get lower, or for the next gen, or trying out Amd for better value. I can see Nv value stabilising in the long term, but I fear the gold mining rush is over now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 05:29:58'] NVDA gained superstar status based initially on its ability to upgrade from being a game card maker to a crypto mining card maker. The story got more legs when they attempted to upgrade again to self-driving and artificial intelligence card making. Unfortunately, those have not yet reached full potential and crypto mining is not a hot market anymore either. It's hard to see NVDA returning to previous market cap without delivering either self-driving or artificial intelligence. The market is always looking to take a flyer on a new story and NVDA's current story is starting to show its age.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 05:36:54'] Based on the changing environment (recession) and China ban, this could EASILY go below where it did at its bottom during Covid.  So we are looking at prices below $50 a share.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 09:01:47'] Probably a lot lower. Crypto mining has changed and other units can be used instead of GPUs. That is gonna keep prices down. Also sales are lagging drastically. Their units are too expensive. $1600 for a top tier GPU is absurd. Only reason we think it‚Äôs normal is because of crypto miners. These cards used to go for 350-500.

Of course, NVDA will be around for 10-20 years and still be leading the charge, so if you have the time to wait, start buying now and DCA in.  On the other hand, as mentioned, we might see flat/slightly up in the short term, but NVDA isn't going to be $250+ for a good 2-3 years at minimum.  Trend is still down and it will be that way, so just DCA in and enjoy the ride.Side note, if it does get down to $60 or $70 like many people are mentioning, you better be buying leaps hand over fist; that would be an amazing play.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 13:22:47'] It‚Äôs going to zero, like businesses, stocks also experience a life cycle. This life cycle is caused by institutional investors. When they start seeing a company do good and their models think it should be worth higher, they buy it up and goes on massive elongated runs since institutions need a long time to complete their buy if their buying billions worth. The stock sky rockets and then once they see something is wrong, they take their massive profits and head on home. The stock plummets and goes nowhere, or goes to zero. Institutions don‚Äôt believe it in anymore and likely they already see new stocks that deserve to be bought instead. So they‚Äôll be moving on. This is called a broken leader, don‚Äôt be an idiot and think your somehow strategically buying a dip of something Wall Street shat in the bin. Your supposed to be buying what Wall Streets buying. I‚Äôll do you guys a big favour and point you all in the right direction. Look up stock stage analysis and buying broken leaders. You‚Äôd see this is exactly what Nvidia is now. Why risk it?

	COMMENT: ['2016-12-20 11:06:34'] The reason why you're seeing AMD jump isn't just enthusiasts excitement for Ryzen.

	COMMENT: ['2016-12-20 04:09:01'] AMD is talked about because it's coming back from a 5 - 7 year rut of having shitty CPU/GPU architecture and little adoption by the enthusiast space.

(I'm a grad student, so real life expenses are on pause for now).  Fortunately, my money has now doubled.Question: although I suspect NVDA and AMD will continue to grow in the long-term, should I just play it safe and cash out at least $15,000 of the $30,000 now?

POST_TEXT: b"A short guide to Q3 with Q4 Earnings on Feb. 24 after market close:\n\nNVDA had a very profitable Q3 with revenue up 22% from $3.8 billion to $4.7 billion. Their operating expenses were down 4% from $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion. Seeing as though they did not have successful net income in the second quarter, they were up 115%. This can be attributable to the release of the GeForce RTX 3090, the latest graphics processing unit (GPU) for gamers and crypto miners. Consistently sold out in stores, Nvidia's new product helped their net income, rising to $1.3 billion in the quarter. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl2vzew8xaj61.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=352d6431d582f2e84fdad2d07b4da7706b7ce429\n\nCash and cash equivalents from the beginning of the year to October have decreased slightly by $7 million. Otherwise, current assets have increased about $1 billion from January 26, 2020 to the Q3 Report. Total assets gained about $10 billion as we see Nvidia investing more into Goodwil"

Wang suggests dropping Meta Platforms and Netflix from the   list and adding Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia to the group.¬†The analyst‚Äôs comments have come amid the underperformance of these mega-cap stocks in 2022. Not only this, the fact that Netflix and Meta   are struggling more than the others to stay relevant to their   stakeholders may have somewhat shaken Wang‚Äôs trust, triggering his   suggestion to drop them from the FAANG list.

POST_TEXT: b'Democratic Rep. Kathy Manning, D-N.C., scooped up thousands of dollars in semiconductor company stock just one day before voting to pass a bill providing massive subsidies to the sector, new disclosures show. One of the companies is already planning large-scale investments made possible due to the legislation.\n\nManning and her husband purchased up to $30,000 in Micron Technology stocks and up to $95,000 in Nvidia stocks on July 27, the new disclosures show. The next day, Manning voted to pass the CHIPS Act, which will help expand semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States while providing the industry tens of billions of dollars in subsidies.\n\nThe legislation received plenty of media attention prior to the vote, particularly concerning stock investments made by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\'s husband.\n\n"I\'m proud of my vote to pass this historic investment in American CHIP manufacturing, lower costs, and creating good-paying jobs," Manning tweeted after the vote.\n\nM'

When AOC AND Matt Gaetz come together on something, there is nothing more clear about what needs to be done (they also came together on legalizing marijuana...it's a very good gauge).

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 19:33:21'] The s&p could be cut in half and still be overvalued. The market doesn't believe the Fed, nor should it. Inflation is poised to take care of the national debt. But no government institution can come out and directly say so.Still too many zombie companies and financial engineering going on.

POST_TEXT: b"**OVERALL**:   The bank sector issues continued to cause money to flow into tech, but clearly not to the same degree as the week prior as the bulls stalled at a major resistance point.  Perhaps driven to a degree by the banks, the IWM is showing the most bearish chart with clear bear flag consolidation.  SPY could be viewed more neutrally with price stuck in a consolidation zone between two major TLs; however, when you factor the IWM and QQQ, probabilities suggest the break will go to the downside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SPY**:  Price remains stuck between two bearish levels: macro bear channel ceiling & the mico downsloping TL from the February 2023 pivot high.  A parralel channel upsloping TL entered the picture this week, which will eventually 'pinch' price to the upside or downside (probabilities favor the downside, look at the Weekly bearish consolidation).  385.65 is the support level to watch this week, the cross-point of the upsloping TL and bear channel TL.  On the resistance side, 401."

POST_TEXT: b" Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is anticipated to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the current artificial intelligence boom in the tech industry, which has resulted in a significant increase in investments. The company's focused efforts on AI technology has positioned it as a prominent supplier for tech firms seeking AI solutions, making it a top contender in the chipmaking industry.    \n\n\nBank of America Corp. said Nvidia is at the forefront of the companies that stand to benefit from growth in so-called generative AI.

	COMMENT: ['2017-02-14 03:36:30'] NVDA is priced to cure cancer, world hunger, and all known diseases. It has a long way to fall. You may see a dead cat bounce soon, and it may even reach another ATH, markets can act really irrational at times, but it is currently way overpriced. When the market correction does come, this will get rocked. I think this will follow same story as AMBA in 2015. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-14 02:23:31'] I think it will keep going down until their new gpu release or when big car companies will start selling their self driving cars en masse
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-14 04:56:26'] It's driven by hype and potential, which is can always go down. However, there isn't really a reason it will go down as the hype and potential have no reason to slow down. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-14 03:37:41'] I made a couple of short term plays and dropped the last of mine yesterday (in at $90 out at $106, back in at $100, out at $112). I Might make another short-term entry if it bounces off ‚âà $99, but I'm weary of the monthly RSI at 95. We did just break all time high friday the 10th, but not very convincingly, so this could act as a double top too.Pulling back to 90 certainly would be normal healthy consolidation. 
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-14 03:49:32'] Same story here. I was going to take my money out next week but can't do it with NVDA this bad. MSFT and AMD have mad me enough profit so may just cut my losses on nvida. Man, I was so close to selling at $120 too :( Could woulda shoulda i suppose
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-14 06:48:17'] I'm on the same boat. Bought it at $117 thinking the earnings would boost it to $120, but it only hit $119 at pre-market adn went down a lot...
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-16 09:21:16'] Regardless of their current market cap or how realistic their future growth is if NVDA were to do a 2:1 stock split today all you would hear about for the next month would be how "cheap" Nvda is and everyone would buy in.Their stock price is not based on normal valuation metrics but on hopes and dreams of a more technologically advanced future. The market cap will fluctuate with people's perception of how likely/far off that future is and how involved NVDA will likely be.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-22 13:32:55'] My beaten up portfolio is now pretty much almost dead, my hard earned money gone. Someone told me earlier that retail investors only exist to get r\*ped by algos and major players. I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started "investing." The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  edit: downvoted for being a loser i already know

POST: ['2022-11-06 08:15:25'] POST TITLE: b'A Case for the 2022 Bottom, but continual 2023 Bear Market'
POST_TEXT: b'# Predictions\n\n* Not a bull recovery thesis, the market is still bearish for likely years, but this is about how the market is bearish and the wave up before we find lower lows next year (if we do)\n* Market bottomed in October. Likely going to rally through December, experiencing a year end selloff for a week and then rally through the new year and through Q1 ER\'s.\n* FOMC to taper rate hike increases (last press conference confirmed this) to 50 basis points, maybe 25, maybe 0 after, then possibly a cut early next year\n* FOMC will gauge market health by summer to match with QT effects and if the market is healthy they will increase rates rapidly. 100-200 basis points in a second wave to nuke inflation\n* If the market survives this Q3 2023 and later we\'re in the best bull market we\'ve ever seen.\n* If the labor market tanks at any point between now and then FOMC will cut rates\n* If there is a market crash, it\'s destined for Spring-Summer 2023 to find lower lows. Market must be "illiquid" '
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:50:00'] Nice research.  My question is the bttom point.  If Dec rate of 50 basis is priced in.  I do not expect much changes until we hear that we are turning around.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:21:00'] You think we can have bull run with no QE and highest rates in 15 years? With most people barely able to afford to keep up with cost of living increase and energy prices likely driving inflation further? None of this is possible. The bull run of the past 20 years was created with low rates and free $. We now pay the consequences. There is NO WAY to stop inflation without deep recession as we have to destroy labor market to stop wage inflation. Recession should last through 2024 (just like in Europe ). Housing, coins, all stocks which don‚Äôt make $ should crash as people with no jobs will be forced to liquidate. The fed will eventually cut rates due to recession but it‚Äôs too late. 2025 we start over and rebuild. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we hit bottom sometime end of next year at around s and p 2700, which would be in line with other bear markets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:45:05'] In response to the first picture, it‚Äôs going to take something strange or significant occurring for the S&P to trade 4600 in the next 12-13 months honestly. The closest we got to it making sense was in August where it looked like rates were going to wind up back in the multi-decade downtrend, then the massive jawboning by the Fed started, which caused some major whiplash there (I didn‚Äôt expect 4600 to come in a straight line at that point, but in the remote world where it did occur it‚Äôd have been near the end of the year or early next).The best case is likely 4300 unless the long-end winds up back under 3 and I feel like there‚Äôs essentially a 0% chance of this occurring without some bad crap going down, and if the bad crap takes it under, the S&P is not trading 4600 in that scenario.If October was it for a few months, I think 4100 can trade again before EoY, but it‚Äôs just as likely that October was just like July and the S&P ends up at 3400 or something on December 31st. In a world where we‚Äôre at 4100 or at the very least, 3490ish sticks as the low for 2022, I think Q1 next year marks the low.But if 3490ish doesn‚Äôt stick, the odds of a secular bear get pretty high, so all of the averages double bottom with their COVID lows in the first half of 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 15:09:36'] Great analysis man. Keep it up...!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 17:54:02'] Thanks for the comment. Market is still very bearish, but it‚Äôs just liquid enough to ward off a year end crash. However this can change in a moment‚Äôs notice ‚Äî new CFTC positional data can cause me to abandon my thesis so I‚Äôll update if that flags!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 13:56:37'] Won‚Äôt matter to me, I‚Äôm DCAing for the next 30-40yrs before I bother caring about the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:17:46'] Thank you very much for this very complete analysis!It makes a lot of sense for me. Even though the indexes chart were telling me to look for a larger rally, I couldn't find more reason to back my thesis than "trust the chart, the fundamentals will just happen at the right time". This is much appreciated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:05:40'] I actually just went long this last week on the Q's/beat up tech because I believe something similar. I just .don't think the market can crash right now (without a black swan event) because we just have too much liquidity... I also think that rates have topped for the rest of the year before they move higher in '23. Then I believe the Dollar is about to cool off as well and all of this will allow tech room to rally and breath, before it's clear that the recession is actually here and earnings are negative. So I think somewhere in between Q1/Q2 of '23 is when the market actually bottoms. As a side note: Markets usually make new highs after yield curve inversions but before the recession hits... So I could see this playing out similarly where we go on a crazy strong rally into EOY... I just don't see new highs... but perhaps the Dow could make a new high, while SPY and Q's underperform... just like what we have seen recently
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 14:13:18'] How would an imminent collapse in treasuries or housing affect this thesis?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:35:14'] What Jerome powell actually said:  "I don‚Äôt see the case for real softening just yet" (talking about the labor market)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 19:58:46'] Great research! Provides some nice  insights onthe current market. From Powell's transcript,  there are still billions of spending awaiting to be injected into the economy. ( Chips act, bipartisan , ) Powell been slow playing the game, easing investors into high rate environment.  Inflation is around 6.6% in September.(this is excluding food and energy data as well, otherwise would be higher) Even if Powell increase rate by 75 basis pts in december, fed rate is still much much too low. Powell emphasized again on how firm they are in maintaining 2% inflation. The expectation of rate increase during this round was 4.4% next year, now after this latest update, market is expecting 5+ %. Notice how they are slowly raising the expectation? How does this impact our economy? Aside from what op said about liquid and dealers holding the bag.... All sorts of debts we are seeing.  30 year housing rate is at 7% right now  (highest since 2002) and mortgage application have crashed to the bottom.(lowest since 1997)  This directly translates to housing crisis in the making. (Those who does Airbnb arbitrage will probably suffer the most.). Moreover, the housing sales so far ONLY dropped by 25% comparing to last year.  (This is not even shown on the government's inflation data.) Powell have been dodging all the serious questions about these impact not being captured on the CPI/PCE data. The housing data they have collects only rent and etc.... Doesn't even touch the housing price. (Supporting data is from Bureau of labor statistics using their shelter index to measure the cost of housing for both renters and the homeowners. "Focuses on the rent tenant pays and how much the rent equivalent would be if home owner rented a party similar to their own."  This is ridiculous method as it would experience huge delay and cannot capture the REAL housing data in real time. .....to put it into perspective, if housing price crashes but not to the point it impacts the rental price, their data will not even acknowledge of the housing crash. Powell is not done yet. All these cover ups or purposely NOT mentioning/excluding critical data leads me to believe ..... It's still too early to dca into "value companies." There may very well be some fake rallies done by these so called "dealers" so they can find bag holders (retail investors) then they'll find positions to take advantage again. Oh right. Midterm election. Lol I dunno if that's not market manipulation , what is.  Anyway, fake rallies, then at least one or two more big drop in the market. Ps Volker back in the days curbed their inflation of like 14% or something by raising rate to 20%. If Powell is so adament on curbing the inflation this time, I'm pretty sure interest rate will have to be much higher than current rate.

People are learning there are no "safe" stocks.When these stocks tank it will be a sign of retail trader capitulation which is a requisite for an overall capitulation in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 03:57:42'] More than Buy the Dip I should do sell the rally üòÇüòÇ. Anyway I believe that the stock markets are bearish until the end of the year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 07:18:08'] The Apple business model doesn't justify forward PE of almost 25.  It's growth just isn't there like it used to be.  Perhaps the price is resetting down to a new normal befitting a more stable grower.  If this is the case the price is going down until the forward PE is in the teens.

Interest rates are going up again this week and it‚Äôs just a matter of time before consumer spending does really start slowing down. The Fed doesn‚Äôt give a shit about an incoming recession and has all but guaranteed it will happen in order to return inflation to a normal level. They‚Äôve said so themselves. The implications of the increase interest hikes won‚Äôt come into full effect for months still. If you have unlimited investment money, keep DCAing on the way down.

Apple stock will face continual resistance along with all other stocks from  the macro headwinds of the current bear market.We still don't know if the bear market is short or long term. It may be over in a few months or maybe a few years. How long can you afford to wait? Selling early could lead to permanent wealth destruction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 10:42:22'] Nothing is wrong with Apple except they realize that people don‚Äôt want to shell out a grand for a new phone. There‚Äôs a recession coming (it‚Äôs been in all the papers) so what do people do? Hold off on big ticket items especially if they can use what they need for another year. Apple saw the recession ( why do you think they didn‚Äôt raise prices ) and decided to play it cool (why do you think they‚Äôve lowered the volume for phones from OEM‚Äôs ) and now it‚Äôs just the markets reevaluating a recession priced Apple.  Wait for your price.  ( $125?  ) maybe
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 11:17:08'] Interest rates are going up.  People will have less money to spend.  Profits will go down.  But at some point interest rates will go down.  Apple has great products and services.  I like to buy when prices are low.  Most be willing and able to hold and wait.

However, NDX100 just needs to close with a 1% decline next week and it confirms it too. If next week is red, next 12 month projection is confirmed at most a 53% decline, at least a 33% decline. I wont predict a crash, because a 30% decline in a week is a crash.On the flip side this could be a bottom lol

	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 06:28:23'] NvdaEdit: explanationI'm choosing nvda because I thinkit has the most potential left. Gpu technology is powering ai, crypto, servers, gaming. Every sector except gaming is a growing business field right now. Lots of room to grow.

	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 14:02:55'] If I had a choice (none of those) - AMD.If I had to choose, AMZN. They have subscriptions, AWS, logistics, etc. They are spread out a lot.
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-28 08:40:43'] No Google or Microsoft love?NVDA out of those choices. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 07:40:51'] Amzn, nflx has just had a big growth spurt and I don‚Äôt expect it to jump too much more. Although with 2,000$ you‚Äôre only going to get one share of amzn, so you can get some nflx too!! Win win amirite?
	COMMENT: ['2018-02-27 00:14:02'] NVDA. It has higher potential profit with the 2000 capital limit you have. 2000 can at most buy a share of AMZN so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it.You can‚Äôt buy enough shares of AAPL to generate the return (actual amount of profit not just % return wise) compared to NVDA or NFLX.NFLX is a good choice as well, but I personally prefer NVDA since it‚Äôs more tangible. NFLX depends heavily on #of subscribers, meaning it has to sustain that growth rate for the long term, which is more volatile compared to NVDA from my perspective.

POST_TEXT: b' St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Wednesday said he thinks the U.S. economy is more resilient than many investors have thought.\n\nI think markets have overpriced a recession in the second half of 2022 and overpriced a recession in the first half of 2023 and maybe they are overpricing the chances of a recession in the second half of 2023, Bullard said in an interview on CNBC.\n\nHe noted that the Chinese economy was coming back from COVID lockdown and the European economy is stronger than expected.\n\nIt kind of seems like the U.S. economy might be more resilient than markets thought, lets say, six to eight weeks ago, he said.\n\nBullard said he forecast moderately slow growth with inflation declining in 2023.\n\nWe have a good shot at beating inflation in 2023, he said, with the Fed focused on inflation and Congress focused on deficit reduction, he added.\n\nThe yield on the 2-year Treasury [**TMUBMUSD02Y,** **4.678%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/TMUBMUSD02Y?country'

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:35:48'] Yeah.  Warren Buffett‚Äôs point is that is is next to impossible for the average investor, or even sophisticated investors, to outperform the market over a long period of time so best idea is to just buy the market hence his suggested S&P 500 (or one of the many ETFs that mirrors it).  You can go broader or pick up international via similar ETFs that each have their theoretical pluses and minuses but basically the same theory.  That 25% of the index is in 5 names is troublesome but that is unlikely to last for all sorts of reasons.    If you were good enough to buy the winners (before they were winners) and sell the losers (before they became losers) you‚Äôd obviously beat the market.  There are various strategies that, if implemented religiously, historically have beaten the market but once enough folks find out about them, the excess returns are arbitraged away as others pile into the strategy.  Most people can‚Äôt and, as a practical matter, don‚Äôt really have the time for any of this.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 15:16:56'] I own a lot of AMD and AOSL. AMD was up 12% and AOSL was up 6%. I sold all of my holdings at 3:59 PM. I expect a drop tomorrow and I'll rebuy.Just like I sold all my IP at 3:59 PM after the 10% increase after the earnings report only to see it drop 3% the next day and I bought my shares back.Similarly, FIBK dropped 10% for no apparent reason on its earnings report so I bought $3000 and made 6% in two days and sold that lot.All of this in the last two weeks, too.What's up with the insane price swings around these earnings reports?

She said that the House would take up the issue this month, before adjourning for the midterm elections. But on Thursday, Representative Steny H.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-30 13:48:28'] Isn‚Äôt this the same picture from Friday??  In other words another down day. I expect this Friday to be another day from hell. After today‚Äôs reports ( JOLTS) and other minor things what is coming this Friday could be another Good News is actually Bad News. The potential report should show 318 thousand new jobs but if it‚Äôs higher ( summer jobs ) we could see higher bonds and lower markets. Will people sell for the Labor Day holiday and take off until schools start opening?  Stay tuned.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 18:23:00'] Stock market still has far too many companies trading above prices that their earnings dont actually support. I will share this that I‚Äôve learned about the stock market during bear markets and high inflation. The stock market has never found a bottom until the rate of inflation and PE of the S&P 500 equaled to less than 20 when combined. It‚Äôs called the rule of 20 you can look it up. The average is around 18.2. Also, in 2021 the S&P doubled from its pandemic bottom, marking the fastest bull market rally since WWII. You don‚Äôt just brush off that kind of irrationality.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 19:35:44'] As usual everyone isn‚Äôt looking at the big picture. Todays sell off is simply the beginning of the downturns in the markets. F Amazon. F Apple. F the fangs and look out below. Stubborn inflation will result in all stocks being downgraded until we have a 12 PE ( or worse ) and interest rates about 5 percent ( or higher) and people start getting laid off. Anecdotal stories of the housing markets are JUST starting! I suspect the October GDP will not only show another downturn but according to the third time in a row it represents a depression. There are too many people betting on a pivot, a turnaround, a sudden miracle where the markets will suddenly go up. Not happening. The VIX had to hit higher than 40 ( doesn‚Äôt mean a capitulation) and can go higher still. Higher interest rates will send NASDAQ below 10k to 9500, a 40% decline ( not unusual for these stocks) and an SPX below 3400.  This is a bear market. Cash is king. Listening to those long term pundits who won‚Äôt care about the pain you are suffering only means they want your assets so they can profit on your portfolios. But then again, what‚Äôs going on may be too late for most of us. After all, new investors ( all you kids 40 years old and younger ) all believe in buying the dips. After your lessons this year and next you can learn what it means to be ‚Äúprudent‚Äù.
