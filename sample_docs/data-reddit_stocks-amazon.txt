POST: ['2023-06-02 08:17:52'] POST TITLE: b'Amazon Is in Talks to Offer Free Mobile Service to US Prime Members'
POST_TEXT: b'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-talks-offer-free-mobile-123703089.html\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has been talking with wireless carriers about offering low-cost or possibly free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers, according to people familiar with the situation. The company is negotiating with Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Dish Network Corp. to get the lowest possible wholesale prices. That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.\n\nThe talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said. Dish shares jumped 14% Friday in New York since a deal with the retail giant could help the struggling satellite-TV company as it transitions to become a national wireles'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:35:25'] If they could roll this out to Canada, they’d make a killing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:41:05'] Amazon and T-Mobile denied this
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:29:05'] I’ve seen Kingsmen, you can’t fool me
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:30:48'] I would absolutely renew my membership if they do something like this. Currently $139 is impossible to justify for me since it encourages spending even more on Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:32:41'] That would be a good deal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:52:48'] Ring cameras, Alexa devices, in car camera systems, and now free cell phone service? Amazon is really invasive but we all have a price for our privacy. bullish.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:52:29'] Nothing is free.Year or so after roll out watch Amazon Prime memebership price jump "due to inflation".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:30:03'] I don't think I would trust Amazon as my wireless MVNO anymore than I would trust Google to be my ISP.Not that incumbent offerings are saints by a long stretch, but I like to keep the roads owned by someone different than who owns the trucks so to speak.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:55:22'] Yea, i would definitely hop on this. I wonder if they would force you to use a certain phone though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:09:22'] Sounds nice, but what's the catch?  They aren't doing it for free.Amazon prime is $140/yr and most cheap phone plans are $200 - 250 /yr, something's up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:45:05'] Jeffrey Bezos wants to hear what you’re saying over the phone
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:55:56'] How this this post still getting upvoted. The story was false and all companies involved have now said so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:44:18'] Annual Prime prices going up in 3..2..
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:27:08'] This just means they're going to increase prime membership down the line, whether you use the service or not doesn't matter, they have to make up for the costs, and it comes from your pockets.I pay for Prime, I know it's gone up now a few times? Where is it at now, $120 or $150 in the U.S? At the very least they should consider having different prime memberships the more they add under the prime belt.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 15:01:31'] Amazon wants to spy on phone calls.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:16:33'] Ohhhh that would be sick
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:30:25'] Wouldnt there still be value in Verizon who I assume would own the towers? I thought they already had a similar deal with Comcast.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:34:53'] And in more recent news, nope they're not lol. And I bought a chunk of VZ on the dip.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:30:30'] this would be a killer deal for me as someone who barely uses cellular or data. 50 a month for that shit is robbery.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 15:11:32'] Great idea. Could be set up by esim.Unfortunately it was denied as fake news and it’s understandable but I think it would be a great idea with the infrastructure they currently have.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 11:19:32'] The article first says they are in talks with wireless providers verizon, T-Mobile and dish then later says "T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon all said they were not currently in discussions with Amazon about wireless service"
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:46:19'] Amazon is going to harvest people’s data so fast that even FB will be like “Dude, chill out.”
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:53:58'] If it's going to be as low quality as their "AmazonBasics" products, it may not be a good idea.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:25:56'] Ah yes. This will have no negative consequences for the plebes
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 17:16:18'] At what point do companies that expand this wide and tall in as many industries as they are get broken up?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:59:10'] This is why I don't really like Amazon stock long term. They need to keep people paying for Prime so they're constantly looking for new benefits. But Amazon only gets so much return from each new dollar spent.When they offered same day shipping they had to double their warehouse coverage, basically doubling their workforce. There was no way they would have gotten back more benefits from same day shipping to offset doubling their already large workforce.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:03:32'] They need to do something, the value just isn't there for me in the Prime membership as it stands.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:04:09'] This reminds me of a super villain movie I just saw

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:44:18'] Is prime delivery really any different?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:49:51'] Let’s get real here. There’s not a chance in hell they don’t have double digit price increases for the next decade. It’s called undercutting the competition, they’ll lose money just to take away subscribers. They when the have them they jack up the price. It’s actually illegal but we know politicians don’t hold rich people or corporations accountable.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:56:07'] Holy shit, if they release this in canada I'll come back to prime
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:07:45'] Fake news by Bloomberg.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:11:38'] Amazon is going to risk being broken up. If they paid their workers more and paid taxes they wouldn't have to worry about what to do with all those billions sitting around.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:23:03'] Spying doorbells and speakers not enough; why not go straight to the (data) source.Hard pass Jeff.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:38:05'] I would rather chop a finger off than use Amazon or Verizon for mobile service.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:50:38'] How tf would this not violate anti trust laws? 50 years from now all there is gonna be is Amazon and dollar stores.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:36:35'] How is it free when you are paying for it via the membership?I'm upset.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:08:53'] This is a total non-issue.  Lots of other companies already run MVNOs.... From StraightTalk Wireless to Best Buy to Comcast and plenty others.People who want cheap mobile service can already get it.  Not many would move to an Amazon offering.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:16:00'] Would this be an NVMO type of service?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:22:52'] Amazon is the Czerka Corporation of the real world.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:34:22'] Apparently it's just talk. I don't think it's going to get anywhere unless Amazon caves and does some revenue sharing agreement with TMUS, T and VZ.When Yahoo was a huge web porthole, they made a revenue sharing agreement with the big telecom companies when people were switching from dial-up internet access to "broadband" DSL provided by the wireline phone companies. After the revenue sharing agreement was signed around 2004, Yahoo put a bunch of crap on their news pages making them almost impossible to view with deal-up internet access. Users complained that Yahoo was too slow but the complaints were ignored by everyone.  People in the know positioned their investments to make money from growth in telecoms that provide DSL and growth in better web sites such as Google or Facebook.I really doubt Amazon is going to cave and share a big part of their revenue with the big telecoms.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:06:56'] This would be pretty awesome. I'm running 2 lines (AT&T + GoogleFi) and I'd love to ditch AT&T, move the iPhone to AMZN (especially if they got a VZ deal!) and keep my Pixel on GoogleFI. I'm all for this. I guess the question is, can they go full-Costco and get their terms from a major carrier? Should be interesting.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:48:36'] Sounds too good to be true
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:11:15'] Dude, I have Prime and I'd be all over this de. Even if it was just a discount, that could be huge
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:13:10'] Ya sorry Amazon I just don't trust ya.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:19:25'] I’d actually take a t mobile sim for 10 a month as a second sim cus they’re on the competing towers in my area.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:34:48'] That would an amazing value addition to Prime. Would drive so many more customers and make it very sticky. Also another market for Amazon to enter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:37:47'] There’s no way they’d do free imo. People will pay for wireless, Amazon isn’t gonna just leave money on the table.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:40:43'] Im in
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:35:15'] Prime recommendations are going to start looking like Aliexpress.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:20:06'] I get free prime through my mobile service. I see a black hole forming.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:29:14'] How is this green when you are paying for prime? 🧐

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:03:50'] This is why ATT was giving phones away basically for free I am sure
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:11:52'] For the first time since its inception, I just cancelled prime myself. I just dont see the value anymore. This would.. Maybe change that? But doubtful. Thing is, they do this, and it's just another chalk out of another market they will control.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:15:21'] Both Amazon and the wireless carriers confirmed this was a rumor by Bloomberg and denied such plans.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:49:39'] imagine being in the middle of a conversation and an ad starts to play.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:23:10'] So i get prime for free through Metro PCS, if this is true will Amazon then pay for Metros bill therefore making it free for me??
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:26:22'] The kicker: Amazon Prime prices will go up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:38:34'] Sweet! More ways for Bezos/Amzn to spy on us and gather info!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:43:08'] Yeah and they will own all of your information. Nothing is free.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:51:37'] 24 hour geolocation, microphone recording and God know what else they are syping on us with. That's the real play here. 139 instant mobile customers would make them a juggernaut in telecom.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 18:07:30'] If they could pull this off, this would be staggering to the cell phone industry.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 18:21:01'] I've been wanting to end my prime membership. Having a free mobile service would be very good to change my mind.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 18:29:16'] I an hoping that they go head on with NVDA on AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 18:54:04'] Well if it's anything like Alexa I'll be interrupted mid conversation to be asked whether I would like a pay for a new ringtone.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 19:21:10'] This is bad news. Very uncompetitive
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 19:24:02'] T-Mobile and dish network be good
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 19:26:29'] Wasn't this the start of the plot to *The Kingsman*?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 19:50:41'] I cancelled my prime membership a couple of years ago because I didn't see the value in it. I currently get Visible phone service (a Verizon MVNO) for 30$ a month. If I could get phone service that pencils out to the same or close to the same $$ I would be tempted to switch. Obviously it would be even more appealing to customer's paying 40 or more a month on mobile, which is a huge number of people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 20:39:56'] Great another provider of cut rate overseas outsourced services.  Super....
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 21:09:36'] Nobody is getting wireless service for $10 a month as is. When it sounds too good to be true, it is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 21:42:09'] Who is going to be exploited now?Somebody is going to end up on the short end of the stick.It will drive many small phone companies out of business, and Amazon will have a monopoly I that too.  Meanwhile, they compete unfairly because they can absorb losses for a long time.We need anti-trust lawsuits to prevent this.  It is already destroying competition in multiple parts of the economy.If they want to do this, issue new stock shares to current Amazon stock holders and create a completely separate company.  If it isn't feasible or there is no viable market in that space without combining it with Prime,  they shouldn't do it.They are too big already.   Bezos can own two stocks instead of one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 22:13:06']  Fuck that. Just make prime music what it used to be.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 23:08:01'] So at what point does Amazon become too big? They are a convenience store, grocery store, online marketplace, pharmacy, dr’s office, tv network (streaming service, and now, cellphone provider? Monopoly perhaps?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 23:16:57'] Fake news.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 23:19:42'] wtf I love serfdom under duke bezos now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 23:44:46'] In don't really suggest anyone to subscribe to this plan if you have some idea about what you are about to sign up for. Mobile networks like this are encrypted very heavily. It means that if you are maker of the base stations, you won't know who/what the clients are talking about.However, as a core network, the visibility is much higher. For example, core network can issue measurement request to get user's GPS coordinates. It can also read your DNS requests, which means they know what site you were trying to access and so on. The rest of the traffic is likely to be encrypted anyway.The thing is, the legacy providers were sitting on top of those data for years without the capability to analyze those data as it's not what they are good at doing. But Amazon is a tech giant with real capabilities to understand and analyze it. And it's not a particular good company to share private information like this with. It's also the reason why I don't want to sign up for Google Fi. But in my opinion, google is far less evil than Amazon. So, yeah, if you are concern with your privacy, maybe stick with Ryan Reynolds a bit longer. Mint has really terrible customer service and website design, which hints that they can't really afford much more, which is a good thing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 02:43:29'] Genisys is Skynet
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 03:42:27'] Amazon could have purchased mint mobile for 1.35b.  They would have millions of subscribers, and those could become prime members as well to offset the purchase. Every one of these phone companies will be doing business with the devil, and if they are not careful, they will lose millions of high paying phone subscribers.  Families with kids that have phones and prime wouldn't keep paying high monthly fees for a line for kids.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 04:11:33'] I’d get prime just for this
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 04:23:02'] Well, that would really hurt the cell phone companies I think, which doesn’t bother in the least

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 06:33:43'] This is awesome.You just know there’s going to be a *huge* catch to this, though. Like all of your data goes straight to the CCP and $5 of your prime membership helps round up Uighurs or something. Nothing is free. When the inevitably massive downside becomes public two years later, Amazon will have at least one major PR scandal, lawsuits out the ass, and valuation will be right back at square one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 06:42:02'] In the near future:Sign up for 2 years of Amazon Prime and receive free air and water for the duration. *fine print: complimentary air and water can only be used by Prime membership account owner*
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 06:59:25'] Nothing I would love more than if this came to Canada, and those Canadian Telecoms get smashed. We pay so much for phone/internet/cable.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 08:07:33'] If the product is free…you’re the product.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 08:20:12'] If they rolled out a phone service and home wifi service that would be great
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:24:08'] They could double the prime subscription rate and include it. Would still be a steal if the service doesn’t suck.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:45:33'] This is much needed, US mobile companies add needless fees on top of ridiculous price and will be forced to match or get destroyed by Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 12:09:09'] AT&T is not only mobile, they have business in the enterprise space selling Fibre networking, security, phones solutions etc. Mobile is definitely a profitable business but they still own all the lines to these towers for the most part.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:37:51'] I don’t see how this would be profitable and I don’t see how it will be any better than any other prepaid style phone like mint mobile, cricket, etc. where you have to purchase your phone outright.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:31:26'] I currently get free prime with my mobile service.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:06:46'] Ugh, another excuse to increase the cost. They need to part it out and give people options on what they want included instead of throwing trash on the pile and using that as an excuse to charge for all of it in one lump sum.I.e. pick 2 features from column A 2 from column B and 2 from column C. I dont use half the junk they charge for, but I have no choice but to pay for all of it anyway.I highly doubt they will allow a loss leader to exist outside of the bubble when they can just force everyone to pay a higher yearly price with it included.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:40:10'] So they wanna listen into those conversations as well?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:14:44']  Cause Amazon doesn’t already know enough about you.   YOU are the product
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:25:29'] It would be hilarious if this marks the top for Amazon.Regardless, I took a swing for a HR this morning and bought 68 shares of $T at $15.  We will see what happens.  On a 5 year chart you could make the case for $14.94 being a double bottom for AT&T.

POST: ['2023-06-06 21:59:46'] POST TITLE: b'What percentages of your portfolio are allocated in Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft?'
POST_TEXT: b"I believe that these companies are too significant to face failure, and their growth will persist in both the short and long term. Additionally, they will gradually acquire additional market share, even venturing into industries such as automotive, as seen with Apple and Google. They will eagerly invest in promising startups, employing any means necessary to eliminate competition and establish dominance. With abundant financial resources and exceptional intellect, they possess the ability to expand continuously. And they will be overvalued too if not already.\n\nYet I'm slowly moving my portfolio to have more and more these stocks. I'm curious what percentages of your portfolio are allocated in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT? \nIgnore the portions in your ETFs.\n(I understand index fund is the way but may be that's not for me)"

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 22:09:04'] Buying the biggest companies in the world has historically not been a winning strategy over the long term, no matter how impenetrable their moats are at the moment. (I'm sure someone will share that graphic of the top market cap companies over time) The amount of runway for $1T, $2T companies just doesn't compare to what is possible with $500M, $10B market cap companies. I don't want to just buy the past winners, but buy the future ones. This is why the core strategy of my portfolio are large tilts to small cap (value) stocks, which is both riskier but also has higher rewards in the long run. They are also a hedge when big tech hits a wall, like happened post-Dot Com. [Take a look at 2000-1](https://i.imgur.com/xIpUKyL.png) in this table of small cap value versus the broader market in down years.I like buying big tech 'tactically', as they do have rock solid balance sheets and moats, so when they do dip (irrationally), I buy them. This rewarded me greatly in 2022, as I doubled down on - GOOG (+25%, 2% of port.)- META (+60%, 2.6% of port.)- MSFT (+17%, 2.8% of port.)- AAPL (+19%, 1.9% of port.)- SMH (+24%, 1.4% of port)- AMD (+12%, 2.5% of port.)Yes I didn't time the bottom perfectly or I'd be much richer. I had opened up positions on these in 2021-2, and either averaged down from expensive levels or bought when I felt was too cheap. AMD/MSFT were among my worst timed purchases. But these are not necessarily long term holds since I already have exposure through index funds and I think they are fairly to over-valued now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 16:10:54'] By no means am I an M&A expert, but I genuinely think people were overthinking how regulators would look at this deal. This is a tiny acquisition at $1.7 Billion of a company that was already in decline due to competition. Sure Amazon already has an arsenal of at-home appliances collecting data, but specifically the smart vacuum space was already a race to the bottom. iRobot has no prospects outside of this deal. Compare that to the $70 Billion acquisition of Activision, which would be in the top 10 largest acquisitions of all time, and Microsoft is already a massive player in digital entertainment. This would be a huge consolidation. I don't understand how people thought the Activision deal would be a safer bet than the iRobot deal.

That round affected more than 18,000 employees.\n\nAmazon made the decision to lay off more employees as it looks to streamline costs and took into account the uncertain economy, as well as the uncertainty that exists in the near future, Jassy said.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 09:42:33'] I work in IT, for a traditionally non-Tech industry. A lot of our people left in 2021 for many of these big tech companies that were booming at the time. Now my industry is booming and tech is cycling down. Interesting how things can change so quickly.The crazy part is that because so many IT people left, everyone who stayed behind got huge raises and bonuses as an incentive to stay. So glad I stuck it out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 10:18:33'] If those 9000 workers made 100k each on average, that's almost a billion dollars. Combine that with the 18k laid off folks not too long ago, and that's like a whopping 3 billion in "savings." On 149B revenue. Last quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 13:29:32'] Can't wait to read the same headline in a month...
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 08:07:56'] The memo (also included in the article):As we’ve just concluded the second phase of our operating plan (“OP2”) this past week, I’m writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks—mostly in AWS, PXT, Advertising, and Twitch. This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.Let me share some additional context.As part of our annual planning process, leaders across the company work with their teams to decide what investments they want to make for the future, prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. For several years leading up to this one, most of our businesses added a significant amount of headcount. This made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole. However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount. The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole. As our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritization decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don’t have the right skills match from our existing team members. This initially led us to eliminate 18,000 positions (which we shared in January); and, as we completed the second phase of our planning this month, it led us to these additional 9,000 role reductions (though you will see limited hiring in some of our businesses in strategic areas where we’ve prioritized allocating more resources).Some may ask why we didn’t announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we’ve made them so people had the information as soon as possible. The same is true for this note as the impacted teams are not yet finished making final decisions on precisely which roles will be impacted. Once those decisions have been made (our goal is to have this complete by mid to late April), we will communicate with the impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies). We will, of course, support those we have to let go, and will provide packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.If I go back to our tenet—being leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole—I believe the result of this year’s planning cycle is a plan that accomplishes this objective. I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have, both in our largest businesses, Stores and AWS, and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we’re investing.To those ultimately impacted by these reductions, I want to thank you for the work you have done on behalf of customers and the company. It’s never easy to say goodbye to our teammates, and you will be missed. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to partnering with you as we make life easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so.Andy

These cuts are all from the tech side of things rather than the FC. I have to imagine a lot of those jobs are just being automated away/growth stabilizing and they're just not looking for new stuff for the people to do.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 15:35:04'] America's strength is in being able to hire and fire people. Amazon hired an immense amount of people during Corona crisis when my Nordic country was shut down and massive unemployment and issues. That is the true "trickle down" that keeps working, but many lazy people think it always meant free money for doing nothing... It's the opportunities that assist people in rising up in the economy.In my country, worker protection is so absurd that hiring the first person for your company is an absurd gamble.You can not get rid of a bad hire, you can be on the hook for years if the worker is a real asshole. They can claim sickness constantly after passing recruitment, and milk the company dry. You can fake sickness for years and the company can not fire you anywhere near a reported sickness, or you can take them to court or complain to a union which is more than happy to bankrupt small companies on legal costs... Even if you are in the right, you need huge amounts of money to get justice.There's many cases of small startups being bankrupted by essentially welfare trolls. It's horrible and I would never employ anyone personally, despite starting my career as such a first hire. That's why we have a growing subcontracting culture now to avoid the socialism.Youth unemployment in the 20% range is normal and accepted here, young people with lacking experience can't find work because of the extreme risk involved.

POST_TEXT: b'The Biden administration is planning to take action soon on at least three of its half-dozen investigations of Amazon  moves that could lead to a blitz of litigation to rein in the iconic tech-industry giant.\n\nThe FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.\n\nThe agency is also reviewing Amazons purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot.\nAny suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.\n\nAlthough Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 22:08:53'] As far as I know, Amazon doesn't have a monopoly in any of the markets it has its toes dipped. This is going to go nowhere. There are no laws that prevent a company from being as heavily diversified as Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 03:05:39'] Nothing is going to happen because they are not a monopoly on anything. And telling them they can no longer grow any more is just about the most anti-American statement anyone can make.So what if they control a lot of retail? Where was the outrage when big box stores were the only players in town and it cost a fortune to open a brick and mortar making it impossible to compete? None of those big stores gave you the option of consignment. All of them imported most of their stuff post 80s. All of them had unwritten agreements about pricing or was it a coincidence that a shirt costs the same today as it did 30 years ago? Goes to show what their margins were.At least now you can compete. Making a website is very cheap and marketing is many time cheaper thanks to the various ways it can be done. Back in the day, all you had was print, tv and radio and it costs thousands a month to get any sort of views. Now you get the same for hundreds.So cry me a river. If it wasnt Amazon then it would have been Walmart. If wasnt Walmart then it would have been someone else.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 08:22:01'] I don't really understand how they have so many anti-trust cases going without making the argument (in many of them) for why what they're suing against is bad for the consumer. >Though many FTC staffers saw that behavior as anti-competitive and illegal — acquiring a competitor rather than competing on the merits — the agency ultimately decided it would be too challenging to define exactly what market Amazon was monopolizing,... Because they're not monopolizing anything with these acquisitions.

POST_TEXT: b'Arguably the two earliest starters in e-commerce to survive the tech bubble bursting, both Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) positioned themselves well enough to thrive in Web 2.0. However, while Amazon today has become a behemoth ($1 trillion market cap and controlling an undisputed majority of online retail), eBay just kind of stagnated ($23.6 billion market cap, only about 10-15% of online retail despite being in second place to Amazon).\n\nTo be fair to eBay, nobody was going to match Amazons ambitions of expansion and world domination. That said, what was once a competitive rival for Amazon is now more of an afterthought than a challenger. Im genuinely curious about how these two early starters grew so far apart.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 17:04:37'] They’re completely different companies. Amazon gets businesses to sell new products. eBay gets people to sell used items. Two completely different markets with the new market always being larger than the usedAmazon was able to diversify. eBay not so much.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 18:45:39'] eBay was for the longest time an auction site. People that liked it, loved it. Everyone else, hated it. The buy it now and offer it options later helped, but I’ve had 4 friends between the ages of 25-35 ask me to buy something for them still in recent years as they don’t get it. Sure all the random basement crap from my folks, grandma, Sears catalogs, kids stuff and new old stock floppy disks sell well on there but folks don’t think new and current stuff. I buy lawn carburetor kits, bags, guards, belts, shop vac bags, knockoff batteries, extra drills, parts all the time on there. Most folks don’t. Sometimes the prices are nuts, you have to filter off outside the US sometimes, doing math on free shipping or paying for shipping plus good price is hard for folks. Amazon makes it idiot proof. They pulled away with the 2 day shipping (eBay it’s on the seller and they’re (even me) picking the cheapest snail mail for whichever party is paying. Folks get off on instant gratification. They can’t wait for a week. My buddy loves Amazon and I’ve seen him pay more for grocery/Target stuff than what other stores sell it for. He doesn’t know better nor care. eBay folks still want a deal. Also, I’m not buying food and household staples there, it would be Amazon. Powersports and auto people love eBay, that’s not Amazon’s strong suit. eBay doesn’t cater well to the volume stuff either. I really hate Amazon as I find it confusing with too many options, eBay has a much better search feature (Amazon does Oz voodoo crap making it impossible to see more than a few hits and filter/sort). eBay moved from auctions too late and Amazon revolutionized retail and expectations with 2 day shipping. Add in you’re not comparing seller ratings, Amazon won long term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:38:19'] As someone who uses both the products and is invested in both the stocks, the 2 e-commerce platforms are fundamentally different. Ebay operates more like an independent platform without their own skin in the game, which has its pros and cons. Whereas amazon controls all parts of its e commerce experience: platform, warehousing, supply chain, and logistics. One of the major cons for eBay is inconsistent user experience when buying from different sellers. Whereas a main pro is they don’t have added cost of maintaining logistics services and warehouses all over the country. Amazon is a huge huge company with lots of other businesses (AWS being their main cash cow). So they have the freedom to afford lower profit margins in their e-commerce business. Ebay on the other hand is only an e-commerce marketplace. I have not checked the recent numbers, but if you compare just their e-commerce platforms, eBay’s percentage profit will come up higher than amazon e-commerce.Addition after reading other comments: contrary to the popular belief, you can find great first hand products on eBay as well. Ensure you check the seller’s past ratings to see if they are good. And similar to prime, ebay has ebay money back guarantee, for cases when you don’t like the product and the seller is not listening to your concern. In such cases, after a few days, ebay will step in and refund the buyer and ding the seller later.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 21:37:32'] I think it's pretty crazy how eBay just couldn't keep up with Amazon. I mean, Amazon was always the big dog in the e-commerce game, but I remember when eBay was giving them a run for their money. It's just kind of sad to see how far behind they fell.I think part of the problem was that eBay just didn't have the same level of ambition as Amazon. Amazon was always looking to expand and take over the world, while eBay seemed content with just being a smaller player in the game. And, you know, when you're playing against someone who's trying to be the biggest and the best, it's hard to keep up.But, you know, it's not like eBay didn't have the chance to be a big player. They just didn't take it. I mean, they had the platform and the user base, but they just didn't have the same drive as Amazon. And that's really what it comes down to, I think.Anyway, it's definitely interesting to see how these two companies grew so far apart. I guess it just goes to show that ambition and drive are really important in the business world.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 17:02:42'] Have you used eBay before?Their customer service is braindead.Amazon thrived because people wanted quick shipping, authentic products, and great customer service. eBay doesn't sell anything. They rely on third-party sellers so naturally, items aren't vetted for condition and authenticity. You're trusting an individual seller rather than the platform. And ask anyone who has used eBay extensively. Their customer service representatives are genuinely some of the most idiotic people I've ever encountered.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 02:09:29'] Multiple reasons for prices to not be corrected to their intrinsic value. Increased Risk Averse, even if you know intrinsic value is high there’s a reluctance to go into a stock because of high perceived risk even if there may be none. Especially true right now, when there is a crisis which causes assets like housing, automobile and financial assets to drop below the price bought. People may be terrified or simply just need the cash so they liquidate bringing prices down even more. More lucrative opportunity costs, 10Y T Bond yields right now are looking really good, great yield and relatively low risk(Maturity Risk Premium). More flight to safety towards perceived safe securities. I’ve actl done a DCF for AMZN so my answer may be skewed towards believing in AMZN’s recovery.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 04:22:45'] I personally think that you aren't missing anything and that for lack of a better word timing the market is stupid.  In the long run, I think that Amazon will fare better than Tesla, Meta, and or other companies that are arguably futuristic moonshots. I feel the same way about Apple. From a conceptual perspective, I believe that electric cars will continue to be a thing and that someday the meta verse will encompass everyday life.  But from an investment perspective, I would rather bet on companies that can execute more consistently and have proven that they don't need their founder holding all the power to survive.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 00:12:21'] People overestimate Amazon. This isn't the same Amazon from five years ago when they looked like they were on the verge of total domination.1. They have their hands on too many projects. Good/bad thing. Good if you can scale it. Bad if it's taking forever and you're losing money in the hopes of it one day reaching the market.2. People have been talking about Amazon's R&D eventually coming to fruition for years now. Sorry, but some of their shit have been absolute failures. Drone delivery, how's that going? They tried to get into video game development and failed miserably with a long-term project losing money and not having enough players. I can't remember the other projects they had that ultimately were scrapped but there are many of them.3. E-commerce is highly competitive and low margins. That's why Amazon has had trouble with it lately. Walmart and other retailers have become very competitive in improving shipping times, prices, and item availability. I used to make Amazon orders like twice a week. I'm barely even touching my Amazon account these days. If I didn't have it for free, I would never pay. Increased labor costs, increased transportation costs, supply constraints... all have reduced Amazon's margins.4. AWS is a positive but cloud is highly competitive with large players willing to spend billions to compete here and growth has slowed. I think AWS is like 15% of Amazon's revenue but represented 75% of their profit. That is more negative than positive. It's unlike Apple where services is high margins but at the heart of the company, their hardware is still insanely profitable. Again, e-commerce is tough business and Amazon is finding that out now. It's too late for them to ditch it so can they find a way to be more profitable with huge retailers capable of giving them a battle?5. Internationally, they haven't had too much success. Difficult to replicate in foreign countries because the logistics is far more challenging when you're competing against domestic companies.Positives, services revenue is bigger than sales revenue so higher margins and less dependability on their e-commerce. Operating margins have been increasing after a terrible two years so that's a good sign. Ad services have been huge for Amazon. They should really take advantage of that. Huge growth and they have the means to scale. Large consumer base, easy target.Big issue is: Too much money being used up on projects that haven't really made any money and investors want results now. Especially when cash is hard to come by because of the rates, you can't be burning cash flow on projects that may or may not work. That's why Apple is still the cream of the crop. They are printing money whether anyone likes it or not.

With a price to earnings ratio of 15 and an earnings per share of 2 dollars (which is very generous) you’d get 30 dollars. However their book value per share is only 14 dollars.

We should consider some alternative metrics to valuate this kind of business. It’s tending to monopoly and monopsony using predatory techniques. Increasing worldwide dependence from Amazon and his ability to  attract suppliers as supposed to be alleys but extracting more and more value from them is what should be measured.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 06:28:41'] Well from what I’ve read they grow a lot from debt. Don’t really generate huge profits. They are all growth all reinvesting. Not all idea work either. But it makes them interest rate sensitive..sensitive tk fluctuating dollar price as they are global..they also hired like a bajillion employees during covid to grow. Then like unions are a factor. And the carnage being out on consumer hurts them for sure. So they are just reeling from all that action. They like a lot of other stocks can’t really find footing until rate hikes are under control.

I buy most of the things I need that are non grocery from there.  I don't know why they are not doing as well as they should.  I have even been buying tires from them and having a local tire repair place put them on.  So much cheaper than buying them at a tire place where they now make you make an appointment and nickel and dime you with so many fees added plus a warrantee cost.   I even got  a great deal on a full size spare rim.   Free shipping over $25 you can't beat that.  I never buy anything I need in a rush since I dont' have Prime and I've heard that its not longer next day anyway.Anything I need for my home that I can get from Amazon I do.  Plus the returns are great.  I returned some bad fitting shorts and a thin cargo bag last week, just take it to the UPS store.   I ended up buying replacements for the items returned.It will go up, they bet on the pandemic.  plus all these new trucks they bought, remember they used to ship with UPS and Fedex and USPS, and still do for things that are not Prime or timely.

Electric vehicles do not meet basic necessary requirements of a personal vehicle. They have no real range, no ability to gas up instantly and continue on your travels, no ability to travel to areas not equipped with electricity, they forever have poorer and poorer performance for the life of the batteries and vehicle, they can not sit for long periods and must be used or will ultimately total themselves (by battery failure), lithium causes intense white fire that will melt most metals and explodes with water contact, and materials used in electric vehicle batteries are exponentially more damaging to the environment than anything gas cars produce by a large amount. Why do you think pretty much ALL lithium is mined in poor, corrupt, 3rd world countries and absolutely 0 is mined in any US land or territory when lithium is abundant in USA. These countries do not mine with the environment as there concern and we do. But we have no problem buying it. Oil and gas is a completely natural occurring resource. Cars today get 50+ mpg and have almost zero emissions. Reality is now were are going to have both and will always have both because electric cars are too expensive for most Americans let alone the rest of the world who makes just a fraction of of basic American income.

Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.\n\nThe reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\n\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\n\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:16:25'] The market cap is just so huge takes a lot to move now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:47:57'] The question around Apple is how can it maintain high growth if it has become so big?  Eventually it will get to a point where even if they make new products that are highly profitable, because they are so big already that may translate into single digit growth.  They would need monster success from new capital deployed just to keep up a modest growth rate.It does look like Apple still has a lot of growth potential though.  They are far from 100% of the phone/pc/device market, and there are still ways they can capture more revenue from its users from the app store, fintech, streaming media, and so on.  Eventually it will start reaching a limit, but I don't see that limit yet.  The bigger risk around Apple is its dependency on Asia for production and sales, and how China may upset all that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 10:12:50'] Out of those three I would say Microsoft. Best diversification, best moat, and has segments that are crucial to government operations meaning it’s backed by the government to the extent of they won’t let Microsoft fail. Apple is very dependent on hardware sales since that is how they get users into their ecosystem. And as for their hardware comparable alternatives are available creating some risk there. All it takes is a few missteps on the hardware side for Apple to crack. Amazon e-commerce is low margin but they do have AWS which is high margin.  Overall amazons success weighs heavy on AWS. Amazon does have data on users like shopping habits and previous purchases to help drive ad sales. Microsoft products are heavily integrated into most people lives to the point where there is no real comparable alternative and these offerings are through so many different segments. This is why I would say Microsoft is the strongest of the three. As for the mega cap with the biggest upside I would say alphabet as of right now. They have multiple growth segments like cloud, AI, driverless tech, healthcare, search, YouTube, and so much more. On top of it they are trading at the lowest valuation of all the mega caps right now. But to the original question Microsoft for sure in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 12:05:00'] This is a tough choice. MSFT is the best value of the 3 currently and has a nice dividend for the tech space.

The logistics tentacles that the company has cast a wide moat alone, not to mention its other diversified operations.The only thing I don’t love about AMZN is the P/E ratio currently.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 12:50:21'] First, those 3 companies are great and I have been tracking them to invest when their valuations are better.  Basically, I am waiting until their P/Es are favorable which means MSFT needs to be at $200 and AAPL needs to be between $100 - $110.  Earnings will be a big decider of that and since MSFT has announced a layoff, I'm pretty sure their quarter announcement will be bad since I've never heard of a company announcing positive earnings and a layoff at the same time.  I'm avoiding Amazon until Jassey can finish cutting all the costs that Besos implemented. AMZN needs to go to at least $60 for the valuation to make sense.All of these numbers might take forever and I'm willing to wait.The one that is the closest on a valuation level, for me, is actually GOOGL at a 19/20 PE.  Fair value is only about $10 lower than it's at right now, and again, another great company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 13:20:21'] I’d go with AAPL because they have very loyal customers who now pay monthly fees for all sorts of services and whose data is hidden from other services. It would be damn hard to meaningfully compete with them. Note I use Windows every day for engineering, used to own a Windows Phone, and am typing on only my second iPhone. I’m not a fanboy, but no body matches Apple for seamless integration.

Having said that, I’ve always have gone with Apple phones and products and will continue to do so. If my IPhone died (during a time that happened to be in recession) and I had to get a new phone, I wouldn’t NOT get an IPhone just to save a few bucks during a bad economy. I’m guessing 9/10 loyal Apple users would feel the same way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 17:14:47'] I’ve done a DCF for both AMZN and GOOG, do note I particularly love AMZN so take into account the slight subtle bias in my conclusion personally I wouldn’t put all my money into 1 stock because if one day FedEX/UPS and WMT decides to collaborate against AMZN I’m not really sure how well AMZN can hold up against them, given that the AMZN store business right now is still in a growing phase looking to cut costs through economies of scales, there is a possibility they may never be profitable enough to generate free cash flow but I like my odds on that.AMZN does have things going for it like AWS, it right now is the biggest player in the cloud space and is actually the one generating free cash flows for the firm. Advertising is one of their most recent venture in 2019, not much information was given on it but seems like cash for basically no additional costs. Word of caution for AMZN though, AMZN has been in negative free cash flows for the past 2 years. Reason given by management is because they’ve doubled their network focusing more on growth, profits later. If you like their mantra you could consider digging more into AMZNAs for GOOG, 80% of their revenue comes from advertising. Advertising is a cyclical business. Meaning when the economy tanks, GOOG goes down with it as well.The good thing about GOOG is that it’s a software company so the main bulk of cost should come from R&D there shouldn’t be very high costs required to maintain the servers, so once products get through GOOG just has to wait on cash to flow in, their margins have been consistently 20+% for the past 5-6 years compared to AMZN’s 2-5% iirc.The most exciting thing for GOOG is that it’s looking to break into different modal for search. If tech is more of your thing GOOG would probably be your best bet.I know you asked about AAPL, MSFT and AMZN but I haven’t had a look at AAPL and MSFT so Iwouldn’t want to feed you misinformation.

They will dominate that market as they did with mp3 players and cell phones. They have a decent relationship with China and when their AR or VR headset ships , China will gobble it up. Sending sales into the stratosphere. They have not announced any layoffs yet while the other two companies combined plan to lay off like 30000 people. That alone demonstrates that apple brass was smart enough not to over hire. Titans like MSFT and AMZN laying off employees looks embarrassing to me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 18:08:04'] Consider this an assessment more of how these stock tickers will do, not how good the companies are, or their businesses are...AAPL is not down that much, nor is MSFT.But AMZN stock certainly has been pummelled.  They've been recently hated as a company and a stock.  That typically is a setup for a strong bounce.We've seen it over and over.  Facebook was getting daily coverage for their evils, their idiot owner tripled down on "metaverse" and then the stock cratered.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.  They didn't change or fix anything.  They just waited for the spotlight to move.Tesla was ludicrously overvalued, and has a psychotic fascism cheerleader and Russian puppet owner.  Product quality tanked along with reputation, and there's strong competition everywhere.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.Nvidia hit a chip glut and people realized a lot of their business was from selling wildly overpriced silicon for unsustainable crypo.  Yet it's had a 100% rebound on... nothing, really.Netflix was mismanaged and hid the fact they hit customer saturation years ago and price saturation too.  Their desperate response was to call customers thieves for doing password sharing NFLX had always encouraged, then an incompetent money-losing ad-tier launch which, at best, cannibalizes themselves for low value customers and negative revenue.  Shady execs now pledging to hide the subscriber numbers.  Stock is up 150%.So while I don't have confidence in Amazon to fix their business problems (like how most of their site and experience is just displaying datafeed entries of third party offshore knockoff junk and counterfeit product inserted into their broken fulfillment structure) I would say that if it's anything like how the other floundering large "tech" companies have seen their stock price go parabolic without reason, they're in the best position for senseless rebound.

If you live in an area targeted by porch pirates, or if there's a high value delivery that you don't want to worry about, or if you're trying to surprise a household member who just happens to open every freaking package that comes in. And hey, I'm going to whole foods for my weekly grocery shopping anyway.From a how is this going to affect the stock perspective, that $10 credit is going to be spent on Amazon, but delivering some individual packages to a single address costs them more than $10.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 07:48:27'] Not sure if this is a thing in the US, but here in the UK we have Amazon Lockers and I use them all the time.They're perfect for delivering things that have some value when you might be out and miss the delivery. You don't need to worry about the delivery driver leaving your stuff out in the rain or handing your stuff to the neighbour. And they're everywhere so I can request delivery somewhere convenient.Personally I think this is more about convenience. I doubt they're about to pivot on the logistics business that they've been building for years...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 05:10:09'] Did you forget that BOPIS is already a thing and fairly popular in brick and mortar stores? Nothing wrong with the option to order something online and then run and pick it up. Particularly for a company like Amazon, who sells a lot of things I either can't find in local stores, or would require visiting multiple places.There's a lot of things I'd like to purchase, but don't necessarily want sitting on my front porch all day while I'm at work. There's an Amazon fulfillment center less than 5 minutes from where I work. It takes no extra time or effort to order something and then go pick it up.Seems like you're getting irrationally upset at them offering a voluntary second option. You know, giving customers more choices. You can still have your stuff delivered to your door at no additional cost.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 19:54:31'] Probably the most important thing that I learned (that I didn’t realise about Amazon before) is this split:Revenues: ($470 billion)*E-commerce and consumer : AWS87% : 13%Operating profit (24.8 billion)E-commerce and consumer : AWS26% : 74%That’s incredible that AWS earns close to 1/10th of revenue but pulls in almost 3/4 of operating profits.So despite the fact we all know Prime and Alexa and the Amazon delivery vans because they’re so visible it seems like the most important part of the story is AWS and it’s future growth prospects. There’s plenty of data about the growth of the cloud which suggests there’s plenty of runway left there, and AWS is one of only three ‘at scale’ players in the market along with Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Google Cloud). *all 2021 full year figuresEdit - wow ok, seems like there’s plenty of interest in these kinda numbers. I can do a proper breakdown of Amazons earnings / expenses / businesses and post it to my profile (will be a bit long and not relevant to OPs comment so I won’t do it here) if anyone wants to follow along there.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 18:08:05'] I can't say I've done DCF analysis or anything like that, but I feel like Amazon is a strong company that has solid vertical integration in their pipeline, strong desires to re-invest and expand in technology and a very solid cash foundation in their commerce department. Seems like the world loves subscription services and I think Prime is one of the best overall. I've been buying.

Be prepared to go negative for a bit possibly but your right, AMZN isn’t going anywhere. It will be the worlds largest company eventually.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 11:38:45'] Amazon lost half its value in 2022. The question is do you think it falls further. Yes, Meta lost 65% of its value, but that was due to the company pivoting to the metaverse and Apple's privacy changes. Amazon isn't dealing with that. That said, no one knows what Amazon will do, but don't listen to people who tell you its PE is still high when the company historically reinvests its profits into itself. That, and a lot of its earnings are tied to Rivians stock performance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 20:20:25'] My thesis is that Amazon will slowly become a blue chip, but won’t see the same massive leaps & bounds of growth in the future. The retail side is losing market share to the likes of Target and Walmart drive-up services. AWS however, is the real golden nugget. If they ever spin-off AWS, I’d buy shares of AWS outright and stop buying the retail and shared services side.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 17:56:22'] Personally, I’ve been buying as much as I can. I don’t see Amazon going away anytime soon. They also have a very strong advertisement business because they are able to see your interests/search history through their online retail store and can show ads based on that information.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 22:09:21'] I like Amazon as a company, and its high trailing PE of 78.22 though lower forward PE of 44.64, is just too much to pay $89,87 for per share, with an operating margin of 2.58%, and Return On Assets of only 2.0%.  The company will be fine even if the shares drop some more.  No need to fire everybody, IMHO.  The problem is the shareholders having bid it up too high.  The company did nothing to deserve the price, or its drop.  This is not an advice to buy, sell or hold the stock.

So I don't like the idea of it being everywhere = good investment. But as long as they keep adapting to the market I imagine it's a good long term investment except they're starting to slack, Prime as a service is starting to go down in value as more companies offer fast and free shipping, Amazon as a website is a hellhole to navigate now a days with the blending of third party sellers and just look at Prime Day they have 95 categories for the same item and it looks like a mess to deal with. AWS is stamped as a backbone of the internet but that is only alleviating the mess that their biggest operating cost which is eCommerce is doing. Even in terms of pricing it's always more expensive, Walmart has consistently been a lower price for me especially with their in house brand for car parts for example.

So it's clear that they're expecting some bad times as a company and so their stock price will come to reflect this. The trick is always to act soon, so potentially now.Ahilst their AI developments are intising, many other companies have more developed AI programms. If AI is the only selling point, maybe consider other companies such as Microsoft. Tech overall is a deflating market so be considerate of the company accounts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 05:10:31'] yes I do I bought last week at the "current lows", expecting a short term rallye (worked), but also for longterm. Main points for me: AMZN as a business is just one of those giants that are a giant for a reason, and the need for that will stay for a prolonged time. They have all the infrastructure and network behind it, etc. Also we can add AWS which is still early and a sector that might has a tougher time right now as businesses cannot spend as much, but longterm it´s a huge thing as well.&#x200B;Now for the overall situation, I also bought other stuff, for 2 key reasons:1) Contrarian approach: Crowd was insanley bearish recently, when many tickers were at their absolut lowest point in quite a long time, people went and sold their shares after bagholding and started to buy puts, banks called for recession and doom, etc. Basically they all were behind before the rate hikes / inflation , now they almost certainly will be again.2) A lot of data tells me that a soft landing after being a bit of a meme, might be what we will get, or at least, we most certainly will not see a crazy recession or crash, as businesses adapted, the market also adapted and the overall economy is really strong right now (given the circumstances).&#x200B;Hence why for a stock like AMZN, I think we got an asymmetric situation, chances that it bottoms here/ has bottomed, and has high returns going forward are much higher, than us dropping a lot lower. And as any smart investor would do, if you have interest in it but just wanna take a little less risk, buy 50% of your position, if we get this "recession scenario", you can adjust.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 06:30:14'] One thing to consider with large companies like Amazon is that while they have multiple revenue streams they also have multiple competitive "attack surfaces," so they have to continually defend turf in multiple directions. Over time, smaller, more agile competitors start to break off parts of your business that they can do more efficiently with less bloat, or to serve segments of your market with specialized services that a generalized player can't profitably offer. Amazon has been brilliant in defending this eventuality so far, but eventually, it catches up with every company. I see a lot more opportunities for incremental erosion in their business than exponential growth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 09:00:34'] Amazon not going anywhere can be taken in different ways. One that it’s safe for holding value over time but also that it’s likely hit it’s peak or close it hitting it meaning there’s not much room for any real growth in the future which can make it vulnerable to value drops.For example Facebook before the whole meta money pit started.

If it recovers to the previous highs, that is more than 100% profit. Since it has already lost 55% since the beginning of 2022, how much more could it lose? Another 10% perhaps?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 16:19:43'] This is great news for Amazon investors, honestly. A lot of these tech companies could shave off a large workforce because many of what these workers are doing aren't essential to the business. It's just a 'project' that they're working on. The problem is when costs increase and there is a looming recession, you need tangible projects that deliver money. My brother works in tech. There's a whole bunch of tech workers who honestly sit at home doing nothing. I'd estimate they probably only work 2-3 hours per day.

Layoffs are just another word for firing unproductive employees or positions because their value is no longer there. If the business is still fully operational typically 95% of lay offs are trash employees and the other 5% get caught in the storm. I always say know your worth and don’t swing your d*** if you aren’t sure what that is. I’ll keep on trash employees for way longer then I should but the second you get comfortable, lazier, decline further and become too big for your britches you are gone. Unfortunately, right now everyone is searching ways to cut the next years costs to maintain the bottom line. Since wages inflated and every lower income f****** felt they should get paid $20 then labor is the hot topic. Most of these jobs in the next 50 years will be replaced by robots or computer screens anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 10:23:10'] All one needs to do is look at the SP500 trend line that has been guiding the boom/bust cycles for about 100 years. We are about 20% higher still with regard to the trend line. We were way, way, way over and above bubble territory. No one knows if we will continue up, hit the trend line or go beneath it for once in the past 20 years. Given we have printed more money in the last two years than we have in the last 50, there is a strong possibility we drop beneath the trend line. Can we go 30% down from here? Very possible. Very, very possible. History is screaming at us to drop another 20-30% from here. Time will tell. Trends rule.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 11:29:22'] From a market perspective the worst is actually behind us. We could very well get another leg down in the broader markets but most of the damage has been done (especially in growth stocks).

The debt at these levels is already hard to service as we’re paying like 400 billion in interest on our current debt. If anything, the Fed keeping interest rates too high for too long will lead to the collapse of the worlds economy and currencies, including the dollar. The Fed is playing a pretty dangerous game here

Only Prime members can use the Amazon Fresh delivery service, although anybody can shop at an Amazon Fresh grocery store.\n\nAmazon previously guaranteed members of its $139-a-year Prime service free delivery on Fresh orders over $35.\n\nThis service fee will help keep prices low in our online and physical grocery stores as we better cover grocery delivery costs and continue to enable offering a consistent, fast, and high-qu'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 08:04:38'] This on top of Amazon Fresh adding a decent-sized *tip* to the bill without first prompting you. It's easy to miss, and though it can be adjusted it's somewhat infuriating that now we're tipping for what are essentially glorified FedEx/UPS deliveries!?Amazon needs to pay its employees fairly and give them some minimal level of comfort - but that is a pipe dream.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 19:07:15'] No surprise, they've not been able to scale the delivery business so that it's inflation resistant. WMT will probably start doing something similar, they're online services where customers either get items delivered or pick up curbside/in-store has lost over $1 billion. They've started a competitor to Doordash, Uber Eats, etc with Spark app plus select stores have an electric W+ van that will deliver "express" orders directly to customers homes. These are costs and can't be offered for free forever.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 05:37:10'] I just don’t understand Amazon fresh. One just opened up near me where we’ve already got 5 other supermarkets within a 5 mile radius and it’s easily the most expensive. I got the circulars the other day and front page on Amazon fresh they were advertising avocados for .99 each while two others had them 2/.99. Everything in there is just to expensive. I can’t understand why they would advertise these prices. The flier alone is enough to keep people away
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 06:58:06'] Definitely a bull case for WMT.They are using tech and their logistics prowess to synergize their brick and mortar, warehouses and online to ship.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:08:14'] Amazon is going to end up going the way of Newegg. Newegg used to be the #1 computer component company, with the best prices, cheap shipping that usually got to you in 1-2 days if you lived on a coast, and the best customer service, Now they have none of those characteristics. Like amazon they are filled with 3rd party garbage, and customer support equivalent to a bot.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 17:24:50'] A bit of a bummer but I doubt people who use Amazon Fresh would notice. I just hope that people stop tipping the driver for the delivery since Amazon will charge approximately same amount.For most, doing groceries is a chore and it saves us a lot of time.

POST_TEXT: b'https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/12/meta-and-alphabet-lose-dominance-over-us-digital-ads-market/\n\nMeta and Alphabet have lost their dominance over the digital advertising market they have ruled for years, as the duopoly is hit by fast-growing competition from rivals Amazon, TikTok, Microsoft and Apple. The share of US ad revenues held by Facebooks parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabets share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.\n\nFour years ago, you wouldnt be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising, said Dischler. '
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 17:21:19'] So there is no more threat of antitrust laws against Alphabet and Meta. No more scrutiny. That’s good news for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 17:55:43'] It drives me absolutely nuts that Apple was able to achieve this via anti-competitive practices that took market share away from the others. It just blows my mind that Apple doesn't have more scrutiny.  It's just easy pickings to go after very obviously problematic Facebook who are mostly just unaware of the scale of the issues whereas Apple and Google are way more calculated about how they take market share away.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 20:10:13'] Probably not a lot of marketers chiming in here, I have over 20 years in the digital marketing space so I'll add some clarity. 1.) Google will NEVER lose search market share, not in the traditional sense. The way you search today, if still applicable in 100 years, will belong to Google. The caveat, of course, is that people stop searching (googling) and start asking AI questions instead, BUT Google actually has the edge there as well with internal AI (not yet public)   Since search ads are the #1 driver of revenue you might be concerned that TikTok or Amazon or Apple are going to take away search market share, and that's just not going to happen...  Unless. Apple bundles an AI search solution on iOS that rivals or beats Google. Think the buzz that Siri had years ago, but actually helpful. That would MURDER Google's marketshare. ...but, as we've seen (with Maps & Email) just bundling a solution doesn't mean users won't gravitate towards the better Google solution. Which brings up one last point. Google owning Android gives them 50% automatic marketshare. So, it's really that last 50% of mobile (iOS) that they have to protect. All that needs to be said about Google vs. anyone else is that Google has search, and as long as Google has search they have the absolute highest intent ad clicks on Earth. Why? People are searching for a solution and able to find it. Facebook doesn't allow this. Apple allows this in an app setting (such as finding apps) but you can't just get an insurance quote or a loan. TikTok doesn't allow this. Amazon doesn't allow offsite traffic.Desktop search is going nowhere, either. Computer users will still use Google.&#x200B;2.) TikTok. Here's the thing. It's a terrible advertising platform for us marketers. Creative (i.e. ad assets) are almost ephemeral in the sense the little twats using TikTok have about 3.5 second attention span. Ads go stale in days, not months. This means advertisers will use it, but lose more often than win. It's kind of like 15+ years ago when Google rolled out the Google Display Network (GDN) which Adsense is based on. Everyone thought it was this massive new ad platform that will offset high search ad costs. Nope, it was just trash traffic for the most part. That's TikTok. There's money to be made, but you're basically doing drive-by's on bored young adults that want to see someone with no bra jumping rope. &#x200B;3.) Amazon. They are a very real threat to retail ad budgets. That's for sure. That's not going to stop people from advertising on Google or FB (especially for ad retargeting outside of the Amazon platform); but ad dollars and ad dollars, right? If you allocate more to Amazon because you sell on Amazon, it makes sense. Which brings up another point. To use it you need to sell on Amazon! That cuts out a lot of Fortune 500 advertisers and doesn't really scoop up much high-CPC marketshare of industries like financial products, which make up the majority of Google's search ad revenue. Unfortunately, Amazon DOES have AWS (vs. Google Cloud) so if you're looking at this holistically as a business, Amazon has a LOT more going for them across multiple fronts. ...but again, this shouldn't impact native search marketshare and Amazon does not drive traffic offsite, so that's a big no to 3rd party ads. 4.) Then there's Apple. This company represents the #1 threat to Google's ad marketshare. As I stated earlier, simply bundling an AI search solution and selling ads would drastically cut into Google's search ad revenue IF Google didn't have a competing product. Apple has something like 50% marketshare on mobile, so you can't discount what they have the ability to do with their device base (same with Google's Android) As an advertiser do I care about Apple right now? Yes and no. No because it only matters if you offer an app as a primary product, and a lot of the companies I work with don't (though, 1 does and we almost exclusively use Apple) and for obvious reasons, the Android version of apps aren't allowed to be advertised. Apple's ad system is also pretty terrible. You can't drive traffic to a landing page offsite, everything goes straight to the download page. Great if you want app downloads, but also not that great if you want to tailor your message. I see a future where Apple certainly controls a lot of overall ad budgets since they have the mobile ecosystem (just like Google does) + higher quality users; but this shouldn't cut into Google's current revenue stream by much. These are 2 very different products with VERY different intent as explained previously. Google traffic is super high intent and that's because people are looking for a solution across endless topics. &#x200B;5.) Lastly, there's Facebook. As an advertiser I've given up on them. All is not well with FB. I would NOT purchase stock in their company unless I believe in their version of the Metaverse, because ads are no longer a consideration. That says a lot. I've made millions advertising on Facebook. I would absolutely love nothing more than to continue advertising on FB for the rest of my life. There's no point. Apple killed them when they eliminated the ability to get attribution, and then FB killed themselves with Cambridge and FTC issues to the point they had to basically eliminate all of their great targeting options. Facebook has 3 massive problems. 1.) It's too expensive. Costs on par with Google. 2.) It has far lower quality and intent. People aren't searching, they're interrupted with an ad. 3.) Attribution is basically gone. Who clicked what and who converted? Fuck if I know!Facebook in its current iteration stands absolutely no chance at taking Google's marketshare for anything but consumer lawsuits. IF the metaverse becomes of a thing and FB controls that, well, then, they're the biggest thing in the world, right? Can't refute that. But, think about it. There's a reason Zuck pivoted so hard. He knows he lost the ad game and it's just a matter of time. Thanks to Apple, they can't fix their attribution problems so he has to create his own fucking world to monetize. &#x200B;\----In closing. Will Google lose marketshare? Probably not. Maybe to Apple. Still probably not.

AWS already has huge amounts of AI managing all network-related things. You'd kind of have to be an idiot to try and manage data flows at this scale without using AI, I guarantee even the oldschool telecoms are using AI to some degree.

POST_TEXT: b"Amazon was already the Goliath of US e-commerce before the pandemic, representing more than 40% of the market, according to Statista.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 09:18:12'] Everyone says the quality dropped. Are they referring to actual Amazon products? I still usually buy brand name products on the Amazon platform.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 08:04:11'] A few counter points (I don’t own any shares of amazon yet). Amazons posted loss is highly due to reinvestment into R&D and their projects. They invest a lot into new projects and don’t mind admitting when it fails. You stated an example of a failure later with amazon brick and mortar stores. But they can afford multiple failures, because the winners will make way more than the losers. Example here AWS.Amazon still has 38% market share in e-commerce (Walmart has 6.5%). AWS had 32% market share and that’s still a growing industry. The market share is important. In tough economic times this will help them stay ahead of competitors. They’ll only end up more ahead when the economy rights itself. They’re laying off 10-20000 employees? Out of the 1,544,000 that’s only 0.65-1.3% of the workforce. To be fair only about 330,000 employees are in corporate/tech that the fore mentioned lay offs talks about. So that’s closer to 3%, which is still a nothing burger. They’re still actively hiring in some of their up and coming investments. If anything it’s a good thing because they’re cutting costs in areas that it won’t really affect. Amazon has its hands in so many pies that a lot of people are unaware of. Personally I’m interested in their dive into healthcare, my wife recently started working on the pharmacy team. She’s worked for many other large pharmacies (think CVS and some hospitals). She’s constantly telling me how much better Amazons process is, primarily just being more efficient and less demanding to work at. I also hear similar reviews from me engineer and CS friends who work there. They also recently announced the launch of drone delivery. Which they got FAA approval for in 2020. This could also be interesting since it may allow for more rural deliveries and potential long term cost cutting on labor. Also I doubt the FAA will allow everyone and their mother to have their own drone delivery, so could be some potential high market share in that space in the long term. Overall I’m not invested because my wife will be getting a lot of RSU and I don’t want too much weight in Amazon. But before she got the job I was seriously eyeing them at this price point.

Our family does almost all our non-grocery shopping from Amazon or Costco. Its also what most internet services runs on. They've also grown to be one of the top digital advertising platforms. I have no Amazon stock as my large cap ETFs already hold enough of them. They've crushed mom and pop stores that will never recover from the pandemic and now they can increase prices to meet whatever requirements the finance pundits or stock holders desire. &#x200B;Did they really have a loss or was it accounting practices for their Rivian stock?

Other parts (the distributing, they offer to others as a service, the middleman).  AWS is now actually designing their own chips and selling/leasing hardware including networking gear.  They provide a variety of Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings.  They are not afraid to go where others don't (Rekognition the facial recognition software to the police and others, Google is more hesitant about that)So I am not as concerned about that some segments are growing less than others, but more about the ability of the management to run disparate business profitably.   Warren Buffet puts professional managers and manages at the portfolio level.  Amazon on the other hand is more tightly coupled.  Bezos was capable of holding everything together.  Can his successor do the same?Amazon may be an good example of where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, that they should become more a holding company (like Berkshire Hathway or even Alphabet) and spin of some entities keeping a small interest.

Metaverse, stadia, Netflix 1 season a week spending, hbomax direct to streaming Tentpole movies, same for so many google services, Microsoft services, and random r&d, Amazon expanding into everything in everyone’s life etc etc etc We Got to a point where these tech companies finally don’t have a big blank check. There’s r&d and there’s the wasteful crap these companies where doing and their accelerated during the pandemic stimi. Since big profits from the main revenue driver where high, no one cared . It was all about the amazing possibilities the future will hold, the wonders of tech, the next big app or device or service that will revolutionize and disrupt the current model. Well, turned out nft was just ahead of this. There was some truth to it but greatly exaggerated and inmensly costly and overall just somehow a scam.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 01:13:21'] HelloAWS - Amazon's cloud computing and storage still pays for all of Amazon's overhead across all its sectors.  AWS is growing & the other sectors it does business in have room to experiment/fail/succeed & build/grow as well while not needing to be profitable.    The pause in normal life benefited Amazon & the return to normal life & increased electricity costs are setbacks, but Amazon invests in its future, experiments & expands on what works.   I own Amazon shares. It may go down in the short term, but Amazon is a company that is in it for the long term in my opinion. AWS is the iceberg and Amazon's retail sales is the 10% we see above the water.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 16:02:11'] A personal anecdote: Since moving from Florida to Australia as the pandemic began, it was (and is) very apparent that Amazon was not investing in its global expansion. In 2019 USA, Amazon’s same day/2 hour delivery was a godsend, yet to this day in Australia, living in a cashed up city of 2 million people it is not available. Most people I know don’t have an Amazon account, and this is in a particularly affluent city. My coworkers see Amazon Prime as a video service without the range or production value as Netflix and Disney. Most products on the store are at best a week away. Global delivery from EBay is significantly faster.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:27:19'] Meta has so many question marks it’s not even funny. Stock could drop another 50% and I don’t think anyone would be surprised. Amazon is still an amazing company that’s on sale right now. Could go a bit lower but they aren’t going anywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:13:09'] Asking this question is kind of useless on Reddit. People on Reddit hate Meta and hate numbers. 1. Which company made more money last quarter - Meta did (4.4B versus 2.9B)2. Which company has a better current ratio - Meta does (2.6 versus 0.9)3. Which company has better free cash flow\* - Meta does (300M versus -5B)4. Which company has a better gross margin - Meta does (79% versus 45%)Both companies spent a ton on capex in the quarter which I assume is money well spent. I assume Amazon dumps a ton into AWS but also dumps a ton into their logistics network (trucks, warehouses etc, all necessary to keep growing the retail side of the business). Meta dumped most of their capex into their AI supercomputer. I love both companies but don't let this echo chamber of hate towards Meta distract you from the numbers. Even though they lost 3.7B on reality labs in the quarter (their money furnace), they still made more than Amazon. Also, the users of their apps grew in the quarter, so the argument that the family of apps side of the business is dying is unfounded.Personally, I would buy a share of each. One is valued at like $250B and the other at $1T. If you want more upside buy Meta, if you want more safety, buy Amazon. I am buying both right now.

Yeah their revenue is growing, but it'd need to quadruple before coming close to that of Google or Microsoft. And that's best case, worst case is they make mistakes and revenue flatlines or falls. Their book value is also comparatively low to other tech. It seems like a terrible risk/reward. Am I missing something?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:33:14'] META is a almost guaranteed compounding machine as long as they just retain most of their user base trading at a p/e below 8. While Amazon is a totally guaranteed compounding machine trading at a p/e of 100. Why anyone with the slightest tolerance of risk would choose Amazon is beyond me. But thats all I'm getting from the comments
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:07:24'] Probably I would go with Meta given you will not invest a lot of money and judging by the response here everyone seems to be scared to touch the stock at the moment, which would lead me to think this could constitute a nice opportunity.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:19:54'] At current value I'd go Google if you want to be on the advertising front. Microsoft if you want to be in data center and enterprise. Both are arguably better valued than Amazon, looking at cash flow rather than earnings. That being said, you'll certainly make money with amazon over the next decade. I do believe Amazon will see a multiple contraction greater than Microsoft and Google.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:55:33'] Meta. They are working on cool stuff that won’t be recognized for some time. When it does, the stock will sky rocket.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:00:35'] I seriously question the viability of meta long term at this point.  The sheer amount of ads relative to content is beyond the break point.  Which really wouldn’t be a huge problem if they weren’t burning billions of dollars on a vanity project. As the quality of the driver of their revenue decays that makes those ads less and less valuable.  It’s all fixable problems but management doesn’t seem to see the problem and instead is doubling down on the path that created the problem.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:18:27'] Meta in my personal opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:10:06'] I work in cloud based tech. Amazon all the way.&#x200B;AWS is way, way, way ahead of everybody else. Google is the second best, but the Google cloud is at least 5 years behind in terms of usability. They may have similar functionality, but the way things are set up on Google's cloud makes me think it is a bunch of silo'd teams, each one trying to show off how whiz-bang-cool they can make their thing, but completely ignoring user experience and with very little consistency across the services.&#x200B;AWS is much easier to get because they have standards across products, so if I know Lambda pretty well, then I need to venture off in to CloudFormation scripts, it doesn't feel like I'm stepping off into a new abyss. With Google, if I'm working in Google Cloud Functions and I need to do some work in the Apps Script/Google Office ecosystem, it is literally a whole new world to learn.\--&#x200B;What is Meta's product line? I really think they don't have a clear product future.  Facebook: Everybody's drunk racist uncle sharing youtube videos made by Russian intelligence to whip up crazies.&#x200B;Instagram: ??? I've never understood why anyone goes here in the first place ??? Seems to be fading from the general zeitgeist?&#x200B;The Metaverse: which doesn't exist, and doesn't solve anyones' actual problem. For instance, if we're talking VR meetings vs. Microsoft Teams or Zoom or whatever, if I'm in a VR headset I can't do anything else but that meeting. I can't be working on something else in another window listening for my name, I can't look at my phone, I can't google something real quick to add to the meeting. Nope, I'm stuck in the headset. Same with watching movies. If I'm watching netflix, I want to be able to use a phone and a web browser at the same time. If I watch in VR, I get a huge screen and great sound, but at the cost of losing all contact with the outside world. To me, that's a net loss.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:56:59'] Meta - but what it's worth VR/AR is the next thing and they are the vanguard. THey are making a tons of mistanke, but they'll learn and come out stronger
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:53:47'] Do your own research I would recommend, but as others have said, Amazon is in a much more promising place right now. Meta is hemorrhaging cash to build the metaverse and it's not a sure bet by any stretch of the imagination. They're also in a hole with the upcoming recession and ad market softness. Amazon's cloud business and retail-facing business are holding up better than Meta's core business and I feel like Amazon's management is more prudent with its moves. But again, do your own due diligence.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:18:46'] Meta- Investors has been warning Z to cut the VR develpment cost. It is out of control.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:05:01'] Meta for the following reason. 1.

Change is leadership (He's one of the most hated CEOs and probably knows it). He might pull a jack Dorsey and appoint someone else.One of those outcomes alone should proper meta back into $120-130s.

It could definitely grow, but it isn’t a sure bet right now. I’d invest in MSFT.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:27:07'] No brainer. Amazon all the way. It shouldn’t even be compared with meta. The market overreacted for the earnings but for investors getting Amazon at this price is a steal. Once the market recovers, it will go up but can’t say the same with Meta

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:47:33'] Google.  After that, Amazon.   I wish I didn’t own meta.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:08:47'] Amazon.  When it dropped to 90 I knew that wasn’t going to stay.  AWS is worth $90 a share by itself.  NFL football, good shows (The Peripheral is awesome, Rings of Power is better then House of Dragons) etc…and of course everyday I see Amazon everywhere.  This one is easy.  They started some great sales today so I think they will beat earning in February due to their sandbagging earnings call.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:11:29'] Definitely Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 21:33:26'] Amazon makes money, and has a good business with AWS. Meta is shakey with making money and is spending money on a wild VR goose chase. I would buy the 1 sgare in Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:31:11'] Neither, there is currently nothing that will be lifting them up and the market looks to be going down even more.Other factors:Even going by zuckerburgs recent speech there is nothing planed for the next year and all the billions spend on the "meta software" is multiple years in the future before a profit.  The only thing that could help meta is that the board removes zuckerburg and they cancel the entire meta software thing.Amazon is still good plenty of money being made, but the biden inflation, the possibility of a full blown recession, and other market issues would hurt them as other companies drop from the cloud services and sales from the store decrease.  We just got out from people living and working from home and doing everything from mail order from work at home, there is not going to be an increase in the numbers from that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:15:04'] It might actually be a very good time to buy Amazon considering how much it is down right now. The core businesses are solid and they make tons of money.Meta is a burning platform.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:17:09'] Amazon, yes. Meta, short term, no. Follow the news on metaverse closely though.I do believe there is a small possibility that the metaverse idea if properly executed and actually catches on with the youngest generation, would probably transform or maybe even evolutionize human interaction. I feel human to human interaction for the younger generation is steadily declining as is and many may opt to only interact 'remotely' with the outside world a decade or so from now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:19:33'] Meta will be dropping for a while still. Wait and buy it when it is even lower (1-2) years. I do believe in Meta for long term tho, I will be investing a percentage into it later because I do see what Meta their vision is and believe in 10 years it will be a high value stock. For now, Invest into Amazon! Since last week the stock price dropped and is at a low level temporarily, just dollar cost average into Amazon. Buy when the stock drops and keep doing that because Amazon is at a low price, literally for discount. Amazon is a sustainable company with a good future, they are innovative and the data they have access to is insane, they will be able to stay ahead especially with all the capital they have. Amazon will show you profits earlier than Meta will. Both will help long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:22:28'] meta is the future. amazon is the past. choose what you prefer.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:37:25'] this shouldn’t even be a debate in my opinion. One is a company that exists solely on the internet and has been declining for multiple years now to the point where it’s at a 7 year low. The other has a global footprint both on the internet and physically and continues to increase sales year after year
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:43:22'] Legit wouldn't touch either. Meta, no need to go into detail.   What specifically is good about amazon? Negative FCF for 4 quarters, declining OPM, PE over 100, loss making in both intl and US sales. This is before we even dive into all the unionising issues they could be facing. Only tailwind happens to be AWS which seems to be slowing and will continue to face competition from MSFT and GOOG if not more. To everyone talking about AMZN, why? If you want a strong cloud play, why not just get MSFT at this point - esp given how much of AWS is going to support their retail business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:46:30'] Metas stock has been crashing for the past 6 months so in bearish terms it’s perfect but invest in Mets only if you really feel confident about the direction of the company. Do you like how everything is almost entirely being focused on bringing VR into the actual world and using that platform to perform everyday tasks despite failing on tapping into previous technology sectors? Sure Meta is pretty much the only major player in the VR market and probably has a major head start over any other company but what if that’s because other companies decided it’s not worth the risk?Up to you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:47:22'] Meta, due to its metaverse bet, is a bet you make with 1%of your portfolio and are ok with it going to 0. Amazon is a long term holding you can safely track at up to 5%of your portfolio and sell into retirement

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:48:53'] You're better off keeping that in a high interest savings account. You'll lose your cost basis on comission if you buy 1 at a time. Meta is burning anyway. Zuckerberg is surrounded by yes men.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:12:11'] You would have to be insane to invest in meta. Amazon was a great investment 10 years ago, now you probably won't make a ton of money but at least it's a relatively safe stock (for being tech, which has been hit the hardest). However I still don't think it's time yet to invest in growth stocks. Dividend stocks will be safer until the economy stabilizes, imo.

My megacorp money is all in Google and I will keep buying GOOG for the foreseeable future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:51:47'] Depends on how long your willing to hold/want your money back. Meta (in a best case scenario)  is going to take like 5+ years to actually become profitable with what it's trying to do, and that's IF it's right in the idea that the new era of technology will have a much greater emphasis on VR/AR tech, which there's no guarantee. Somewhat like early bitcoin investing. No one really new what was gonna happen with it. Amazon is going to be much more consistent but doesn't have this potential blow up factor

SQQQ can technically go to zero if holding too long. It will do a reverse split to dilute the price.  Her $20 SQQQ(as an example) became $4 etc. She should sell at loss before it becomes worthless.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 05:41:50'] As much as people like to shit on portfolio managers because of high fees and returns that often do not match the market, I am SO glad my mother is using one.  It stops her from doing dumb things based on what she hears on TV, Youtube, podcasts.She's the kind who tries a new diet multiple times a year, or a new miracle supplement several times a year because she hears it on Youtube.  Even when she knows it must be wrong she keeps listening anyway.  Drives me crazy.Anyway I have no advice for you since I do not know the rest of her financial situation and risk tolerance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 03:14:16'] I believe this is a troll post
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 02:40:29'] My mom asked me to explain stocks to her. I'm doing it very slowly, repeating on every step that the older you are, the less reasonable it is to try stock picking, about risk management, about transition to less risky instruments as you get closer to retirement, about how ETFs would be the best choice for her, how "experts" are just trying to push shit to cash out. Goes all right so far, but I'm still hesitant because of stories like that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 03:35:52'] 4 month ago qqq is at like 23 PE ratio.  Not sure why she would buy sqqq at that time.qqq PE ratio is at 28.41 now.  I don't know if it will go up or down.  But at the last high point it is at 40 PE ratio.  I wouldn't personally hold on to it myself.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 04:40:51'] What will happen of she holds until the next crash?  Or, do you expect QQQ to not crash ever again,  below 2021 levels?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 04:13:15'] As soon as you convince her to sell, the market will tank and sqqq is gonna skyrocket.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 01:16:38'] That's brutal.  Maybe you can have her read the wiki pages for SQQQ and how this strategy of holding is 100% doomed.Advise her to throw it in some vanguard retirement funds and stop thinking.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 02:56:08'] The trouble is that SQQQ is likely going to experience a decent bounce with QQQ so far into overbought territory. As much as it sucks, it would REALLY suck if you convinced her to cut her losses only to see SQQQ double over the next month or two. Again, that's a real possibility.It's a tough spot to be in. Personally, I'm holding SQQQ, but I didn't start buying until the past couple weeks, and I started very small and adding from here. Leveraged funds need to be entered slowly and piecemeal IMO. Sounds like she didn't do that, and certainly got in way too early.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 05:44:38'] I am not saying this is the case. I am saying however you should consider it and explore conversations with her and the family. If she has lost the mental capacity to understand what she is doing, brokers are required to have a procedure in place for protecting the client's best interests. You would call her broker and explain your concerns and why you have them. The broker then does a wellness check and documents the case. If there is a case for the broker to be concerned they defer to the appropriate state laws. Having had to field a few of these cases when I was a broker, I can assure you that while 50 isn't that old, her case would have gotten a thorough investigation. It is a regulatory requirement for brokers to follow up on clients they consider to be at risk.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:34:41'] Hey there, fellow primate! This sounds like a pretty sticky situation, let's peel it back with Monkey Banana language.    Your mother found a bunch of SQQQ bananas (bought shares in SQQQ), and those bananas have been rotting (losing value) over the past four months. It sounds like she may have been attracted to the shininess of these bananas without understanding that they don't stay fresh for long (the concept of decay in leveraged inverse ETFs).    First, remember that each monkey has to choose their own bananas. Even though you introduced your mother to the jungle, she makes her own decisions about which bananas to pick up.    That said, it's always tough to see someone we care about keep holding onto rotten bananas. You might try sharing with her stories of other monkeys who've had similar experiences, or pointing her to resources that explain in simple terms why these particular bananas aren't good for long-term holding.    Perhaps she would be open to talking with a wise old monkey (financial advisor) who can help her understand the risks and strategies involved in picking bananas in the jungle (investing in the stock market). Sometimes hearing it from a third party can make a big difference.    Finally, don't forget to look after your own bananas. It's great that you want to help, but remember that every monkey has to learn their own lessons.    Need more tips on how to navigate the banana jungle? Check out [The Banana Investor](https://thebananainvestor.blog). We're here to help you peel back the layers of the financial jungle! 🍌🌴

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:42:24'] Not financial advice, just an observation. No one should be in leveraged ETFs, inverse or not, if they can't articulate the concept of daily leverage resets and the impact of constantly growing disparity between the price you paid and the value of your holdings. These are generally tools for complex hedging strategies and most should be held for 1 day (reset period dependent). Anyone who is like "ooh we can make twice or triple" vastly misunderstands the operation, uses and value of those products. If you are just going to try to time the market buying and selling those products, you're like someone who wants to be a pool shark but doesn't know they're in a bowling alley.

Which was fine being and Ultrashort fund, it took off like a rocket ship and he nearly tripled his investment.  But one it peaked he never got out thinking it was just a dip.  We tried to tell him to get out but would not and he rode this down to the point it was worth hardly anything.  He  also did that with several stocks as well.The problem with advice when getting into an investment is the there is no advice when to get out!  There is always someone with a hot tip but those same people never comeback and say - ditch it!I learned a lot from watching him and I have overstayed my welcome on a few stocks as well!  There is always the unrealized loss that you hope will track back to a gain.

People introduced to this stuff after a certain age, even middle age, cannot grasp the complexity of the market and how individual stocks or funds operate in them, and worse, have a lot of money in the bank to lose. Everyone has to learn some lessons in the market when they are starting out. It’s fine to learn those lessons when you’re young, with a lot less money to lose and a lot of time to make up for the losses. Learning them when you’re older is catastrophic.

Salaries for these companies were mostly market.Average employees in Silicon Valley don’t have private offices.The shuttle busses are to take people from San Francisco to Silicon Valley because no one wants to live in Mountain View or Palo Alto because Silicon Valley is boring AF (and expensive) for the 20 and 30 somethings that are the backbone of these companies.The laundry service was because employees spent so much timeworking and commuting they don’t have time for it.The extravagance at places like google is often highlighted but I think this is being used as a rhetorical foil to distract folks from the elephant in the room, excessive executive compensation.But that’s my 2 cents that ain’t worth shit.

When I miss out I ask myself a few questions: why did I miss that one or not pull the trigger if I saw it? If I was just asleep at the wheel then I’ll take the L. But if I was abiding by some personal investing principle (ex: “why did I miss that run up?? Oh yeah, cuz they were already trading at a   50x multiple!”), then I tell myself for every great swing I didn’t take, I probably saved myself from several big fails. It’s easy to see the FOMO the opportunities we missed, but people rarely track the times the didn’t pull the trigger and are the better for it. Rule #1 don’t lose money…
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 17:52:39'] I look at my META position that I recently bought in below $90 and feel a little better.  In all honesty, it’s not worth punishing yourself for it. I bet many Nvidia holders are torn in a different way. They’re sitting on gains, wondering if they should hold or sell. Fear of selling something that keeps mooning and fear of holding through a “crash” while missing profits isn’t a fun situation.Psychological battles go both ways.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:14:43'] Not anymore, but I agree with the title. But I will give my advice if anyone feels victim of hindsight biasI’ve been following stocks for three years now. I started when I was 18, in 2020, I am 21 now. During those first couple of years, market went wild. I missed seemingly every opportunity.But one thing I realized. The opportunities kept coming, and will keep coming. First next gen tech, then EV, then crypto, then rotation out of tech, now back to tech, and AI. There is no shortage of opportunities in this world. If you keep your eyes open for the next opportunity, instead of reflecting on the past and what you missed, you will find it. This is a mistake people often make. They chase after trains that have already departed not seeing the new one arrive at the station. Artificial Intelligence is just getting started. I always was bummed I wasn’t alive or old enough during the early days of the internet, because that seemed like a generational wealth creation opportunity I missed. And then came ChatGPT. I now know a second wealth creation opportunity has arrived. I believe the best companies in the AI space have yet to even form! People forget Amazon IPO’d late into the tech bubble, 1997 I believe. Maybe the next great AI company is still under construction. But keep your eyes out instead of reflecting on the past. One final word about Nvidia- nothing intrisntic about the business changed, the arrival of ChatGPT changed the company’s outlook. It was getting (unfairly) beat down in 2022 , no one saw ChatGPT coming unless you worked in the space. Good luck investing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:30:31'] I sold 40 shares of it in 2014 because it barely moved in 5 years. Made a $40 profit. That would be 160 shares now at around $3-4 cost basis. I can't beat myself up about it because I literally bought it in 2009 thinking "Hey, that's the company that made my graphics card, cool".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 03:11:06'] Thing is it works both ways. There were people later last year who were laughing at those holding NVDA because according to them at $300 it was obviously overvalued and in a bubble and would continue to fall in value.I think that's the interesting thing about investing – people who have been long NVDA over the last few years have been both extremely wrong and extremely right. The consensus "rightness" or "wrongness" of their thinking depends mostly on market volatility at the given time period than anything fundamental.In 6 months it's just as likely there will be threads here asking if people are beating themselves up for believing in the AI hype. It's really only over very long time periods you can say with any confidence if an investment was right or wrong. Well, unless you've somehow been successfully trading these swings – those are the real winners here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:11:34'] Zoom out, NVDA was at 340 level back in 2021 & then at 100 in 2022. What goes up & down that easy is not an investment, it's speculative gambling. NVDA is a mega cap penny stock these days & it's probably not going to end well for those FOMOing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:42:37'] NVDA was never obvious. It’s been overpriced for five years. I say this as someone who blindly dumped half my cash into two years ago and made out very well. It was dumb luck, buy and pray.META earlier this year was obvious, and I didn’t get in, and THAT I regret.

Because when I look back I know that I could’ve just as easily lost everything so it’s useless to look back and beat yourself up for what you could have done. Also if I don’t understand the company I don’t invest even if I lose out on the biggest investment opportunity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 18:43:18'] Nvidia and AI is obvious, but I thought the slow down of crypto mining and the end of ETH mining was going to keep Nvidia down for awhile. I still believe it might be a temporary pop, I dont quite believe they are valued correctly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 20:10:10'] Tech will continue to outperform all other sectors.I've heard people call tech a bubble in the entirety of the past decade and more. (You have encountered them).The people who always try to convince you that the fall of tech is just around the corner, that perhaps another - unknown stock - will lead the next decade. (You have encountered them).These people are the same people who hate on people who buy Nvidia 4090 GPUs. They know what's the best of class product or stock, but don't want other people to enjoy the gains if they don't have it (crabs in a bucket).Beware these people, as they can sound convincing and once you accept their (tech bubble) ideas, you may also become one of these people after you miss out on gains.It's better to **keep it simple.** Tech revenue is growing at high double digits, that means their outperformance is still intact as no other sector is growing so. Debating over whether the stock should be 25 or 35 PE is meaningless, because double digit growth changes PE ratios quickly.For example, MSFT's EPS is 2.5x higher than it was just 4 years ago. It might be hard to appreciate 20% in one year, but it adds up. That means 35 PE becomes 14 PE in just 4 years.If you buy tech at a local peak and it goes down, like it did in 2020 and 2022, you're supposed to average down. MSFT Azure was growing at 46% this time last year despite the falling share price. They are opportunities and not "aha tech bubble" moments.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:09:04'] Always remember the reason you didn't buy the stock:- Overvalued- OverhypedAnd always remember how these reasons SAVED you from buying failing stocks.In an alternate universe where you did make 100% gains from Nvidia, you also made 100% losses from other impulse stock purchases.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:26:05'] AI became somewhat obvious if you read the gpt-4 paper and used the model extensively. But I can see why it wouldn’t be if you weren’t familiar with the tech. I think most people who have gotten into AI have realized eventually we would reach a threshold where the tech would very quickly begin to yield extreme gains in productivity and companies like nvidia would be the first to reap those rewards in a big way but it just wasn’t obvious when that would happen. GPT-4 has changed that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:23:02'] I'm a huge NVDA bull since 2022 and tbh even I was caught off guard at the ferocity of this rise so fast.  I was just 99% confident it'd beat SPY in the long run, not to be up 177% YTD (and still holding).Jensen's executed flawlessly with his vision.  ChatGPT was just the spark to get everyone to notice.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:34:35'] The people who are religious about nOt tRaDiNg are so obnoxious. "Oh, I'm glad I didn't buy NVDA before it popped 25% overnight because *someday* it's going back down and I'd drop dead on the spot if I ever incurred a single dollar of short term capital gains", get the fuck out of here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 18:00:44'] I rarely experience it since I rarely buy individual stocks and just DCA in ETFs. But I did just buy an ETF of 18 US banks (some of the biggest) since they were down of 30 to 50% and I believe US banks are gonna be fine long term. I also bought the same ETF with covered calls yielding 14% as a back up. While they stay flat I still rake in 14%, if it goes down even more, if it goes up both ETF will gain value. But I purchased these with the portion (max 10%)of my portfolio I use to have fun with.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 18:05:13'] For me, there is too much opportunity in the market. In the sense that, I wish I could participate in every opportunity but can't, but I have an appreciation for it nevertheless.Never really cared for the AI buzz. I thought ChatGBT was cool when it first got popular couple months back. After a week or two, the interest fell flat for me. Therefore, I had a pessimistic, skeptical POV on the AI buzz (at least in the stock market, retaining to specific equities).I'm actually reluctant to not get too hurt on AI stocks. Since I had my view as I did, I was generally short these type of stocks. So for me, I never had FOMO or beaten myself about NVDA, META, or AI penny stocks runups.

That being said, having a risk management mentality is not a bad thing either.   Yeah, you might miss a few quick high flyers but overall you will do well.  Don’t let the “I missed it” attitude cause you to make mistakes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 20:04:00'] Nvidia has been working on this for a long time and I knew they may get a bigger piece of the pie , but thought they were expensive and speculative risk. The good thing is there are others out there that we don’t know about and can be the next growth company. If AI is taking off then who are the biggest small players that may benefit?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 21:32:37'] My very first picks getting into stocks were Nvidia Sony and AMD. When amd was like 6 and Nvidia was like 40 before the split. Since I wanted to invest in VR. Vr not panning out but amd and Nvidia both doing great for other reasons.I bought sony and AMD but didn't get around to getting Nvidia. Unfortunately I sold most my amd right before covid flash crash in the 40s. Since E-Trade was taking forever for me to get approved for options. I guess it was just a browser issue. If I had been approved I wouldve just bought AmD puts against myself but instead I sold for profit to be safe.I can't believe I picked the best stocks off the bat. Covid really screwed me and made me pull a "it's a wonderful life" panic sell because of covid. Why didn't I learn from the movie :(((
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 21:56:35'] I’m annoyed that I bought 2 shares of NVDA at $210. Just two. And one share of LLY at $327. Just one. It’s nice to see them skyrocket, but would be better if I had bought more. The only way I’ll get more shares now is if they split (which won’t really be more shares), or if they plummet and I buy them on sale. Oh well!

I stopped following it because of their comment. Years later, I met a person who invested in bitcoin in 2016. We had a long conversation about crypto and how much money he made from it. I wanted to cry lol. Now look at the numbers. Oddly enough years later at the peak, the same person who called it “chuck e cheese money” called me to tell me about investing in crypto.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 08:48:33'] They do really need to clean house in HR. I got an offer from them with a total compensation package near $700k a year. I, of course, had a lot of questions. I met with five different people in HR. I didn't really mind the number of trips since I live near their HQ in South Lake Union and work a couple of blocks from the one HR person I met with in Bellevue, WA. None of the five could answer even basic questions. They were all not only stupid, which is fine, not everyone is smart, but they were extremely lazy. They wouldn't even ask someone higher up for the answers, much less do their own research. After I think it was seven months total from scheduling the first interview to back and forth meetings with HR, I found out the average person on that job had been there less than nine months and new hires lasted less than five months on average. So, I'd be working with guys that mostly didn't have that much experience, and I wasn't even sure I'd have the job for five months. So, the hiring process would have probably taken longer than the job lasted. I joked about that with one of their HR directors, and he didn't think that was funny. He thought it was normal. To make it worse, the vesting was only 5% the first year, so if I left in less than a year, I would have made less than I make on my current job! No thanks.Aside: I worked on an LMS (learning management system) for human resources about 15 years ago. Our goal was to provide training for certifications like SHRM. The vast majority of HR employees failed miserably, and they just weren't trainable.

POST: ['2023-01-05 10:33:48'] POST TITLE: b'Amazon now generates about $38 billion in ad revenue (third-largest share of the U.S. digital ad market)'
POST_TEXT: b'Full article at WSJ (paywalled). \n\nA macroeconomic slowdown coming just as Amazon has been trying to absorb a major expansion of its fulfillment capacity has proved especially unfortunate for the e-commerce company. When it reports full results for 2022 later this month, Amazon is expected to show its first-ever year of percentage revenue growth in the single digits, while operating margins have fallen by more than half from the previous year.\n\nWall Street hasnt been kind; Amazons share price fell 50% in 2022its worst year since the dot-com bubble burst and notably worse than its mega-tech peers, save for Facebook-parent Meta Platforms. Amazon has shed more than $1 trillion in market value since the stock peaked in July of 2021, during Mr. Jassys first week on the job. \n\nBut unlike the woes of Facebooks parent, Amazons troubles cant really be blamed on a massive strategic misstep by its current boss. The slowing economy has hampered both retailers and cloud companies, Amazons '
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 11:11:22'] Analysts are funny. The retail expansion wasn't a mistake in timing. It was to take as much of the market as fast as possible, to better leverage scale down the line. As long as the losses aren't an existential threat, its perfectly fine to expand till things slow. Thats where they are now. Time to adjust and prepare for the next growth cycle.The end goal for Amazon is extreme efficiency and when it comes to that as well as logistics and warehouse automation, Amazon is the world leader and no one is even close. This is precisely because they are tech savvy unlike most other retailers.So the long term picture is that Amazon wants to be a vertical retailer. From manufacturing products, to shipping them, warehousing them, and selling them. In time this will result in a significant pricing advantage over competitors.Of course nothing goes perfectly smooth. You will get some lucky years and some unlucky but you still need to push forward or be left behind.All that said, Amazon still has tons of room to grow in retail. Grocery is still a small piece of the pie and you can see that they are trying to push into it. But grocery is hard due to shelf life. And Amazon doesnt want more traditional retail stores so its sort of a pickle. Enter the check-out-less stores. Those just stared a few years ago. Obviously they have a long way to expand once they nail it down.They are also making a huge push with in house products. The number of in house stuff has expanded greatly the last few years. Its really impressive actually and the products are not bad. Not like the early days of generic brands.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 16:38:56'] As an Amazon seller of 15 years I’ve been saying Amazon ads will be the leader eventually if Amazon keeps growing .You can’t succeed selling on Amazon without constant never ending ad spend .So many sellers are dumping so much money in ads they might not break even for 6-12 months on a piece of shit item . After all Amazon fees and ads combined some people are giving 50 cents out of every dollar to Amazon
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 10:48:05'] Amazon as a company seems to really be making fantastic decisions. In the land of big tech once people flock back to stock its tough to argue why Amazon wouldn't be rewarded with a higher stock price.

The only way I see them growing shareprice is if thejr margins improved on the retail side but thats going to be tough in the current environment. AWS and their Ad growth is the best part about them and holds the most value.

However, the company is expected to report its first single-digit percentage revenue growth for 2022 when it releases full results later this month, and operating margins have fallen more than 50% from the previous year. The macroeconomic slowdown, coupled with Amazon's expansion of its fulfillment capacity, has led to the company's share price falling 50% in 2022 and a loss of more than $1tn in market value since July 2021. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is expected to oversee layoffs that will affect more than 18,000 workers, mostly in corporate staff.

These last few years were clearly a bubble which formed due to the incredibly low interest rates and you are now seeing reversion to the mean.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 14:49:39'] Companies of mine reporting:AMD, META, AAPL, GOOG, XOM, SBUX, CLFD (tiny position).Putting down predictions so I can embarrass myself:- AMD: Will fall 5% as it gets dragged down in the PC segment.- META will beat (+3-5% move). Expectations already decimated.- GOOG will miss and probably be flat. Some positive news on share buybacks.- AAPL: No clue. I think to the downside.- XOM: Will rise 3-4% on massive share buybacks/dividend announcement (Chevron didn't get that much heat for theirs). - SBUX: Will not only beat earnings, will give insanely good guidance thanks to China. Stock price up 5%.- CLFD: Big rise on great guidance and information about government spending tailwinds. Unless they announce some big acquisition which is possible given recent announcements of share issuance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 03:15:16'] It's just dumb to short NVDA because at best it's a great company that's overvalued. TSLA was literally going bankrupt a few years back, so it's not really a fair comparison.And while I'd argue it's massively overvalued relative to other tech valuations, it's probably not that overvalued if you believe they can achieve 50% growth rates for several years while maintaining 30-40% net profit margins. In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.I think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.Personally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price. With lots of companies now beginning to build their own AI-optimised chips I worry whether NVDA can defend their margins. If they execute well I think they probably can, but when you have a stretched valuation that's not really good enough.

Enterprise/dev tools, GeForce Now etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 23:42:20'] Keep in mind Amazon is a garbage e-retailer. E-retailers have 1% margins, so that revenue sounds impressive but Amazon essentially makes no profit from any of it that came from selling things on Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 17:38:10'] Longtime Jumia bag holder here.  My opinion:Overall, they had poor growth the first couple years after IPO.  They were changing their model from direct sales of big ticket items to third party sales and high volume consumer staples.  So as the volume of sales went up, they lost the highest profit margin business so that hurt their sales growth.  But even with that they underdelivered.But this is a good decision long term and the last earnings report was actually really good (imo).  Large increase in revenue, net loss stayed about same, so improving margin.  They are basically breaking even minus advertising - which isn’t great but def improving.  Their net loss stayed steady despite something like 45 percent more sales.  So they aren’t just losing more to get more sales.So high revenue growth, improving margins, some of the advertising should be coming off books to be matched with new sales mean they may break even in next year or so.  But if I’m being honest, I think their path is to grow sales at the fastest clip they can without losing money so i don’t expect any earnings any time soon - but if they can keep growth over 25 percent while breaking even I think that’s a win… or even lose money for 45 percent growth is fine in a bull market not now.So Financing will be hurt by market rates and exchange, but by my estimates they can survive a couple years even at status quo.  I also think the share price is crushed because the best companies to buy them were Chinese, and China has been crushed.Amazon is coming NOW, and that is scaring everyone but I think that’s actually good.  Amazon will bring a lot of infrastructure and demand for online which should raise all the ships.  There is room for several online companies.  I also think if Amazon has any brains they’ll just buy 25 percent of one of these dirt cheap front runners and build their network out from there instead of starting from scratch.  That should boost all of their values.It’s Africa - you knew it wasn’t going to be easy.  But I still think what they got is worth way more than 4 per share and I bet they’ll hit 20 in a year or two when everything recovers…. But it’s gonna be a white knuckle sorta investment, maybe 25 percent it goes to 20, 50 percent it limps around forever and and 25 percent it craps out.  It’s not a BAD expected return, but just super risky and you can find some better bets out there if you look hard enough, but this isn’t totally terrible for high risk profiles.Beyond that it comes down to can africa become a world economic engine.  Honestly the news of the last year strongly points to no.  Nationalization of mines, labor strikes, currency collapse, corruption all seem to be so imbedded it can’t be solved in the next decade, and this Russian war is gonna make food scarce…. But africa is resilient, so perhaps it can rise!  But a lot of jumia’s potential value is in Africa’s ability to have massive exponential growth which it has been really unable to deliver much in terms of positive signs.  But things change!  I wouldn’t bet against africa to grow a ton in our lifetime, but you might not want to put all your eggs in Africa, in fact maybe just put one or two you can afford to lose cuz it’s kinda obviously a bad idea on face.I also think the payout here is extreme.  If Jumia is the front runner, and africa becomes an economic engine either on its own or because of  some US/Chinese/India fallout… you might have that generational stock.  As others have said, you might be better off with AFK or something if you aren’t going to follow it close.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 09:11:30'] I think its a lot of people hoping for the next big thing and not knowing the market over there.Same with the pump that happened with that Korean delivery company (name escapes me at the moment). People jumped on it when it announced a listng without finding out it wasn't able to understand other markets, and it had reached the limits of what it could do in its home market.People just want to hop on the next amz /uber bandwagon before it takes off. They place hope and faith over due diligence and research.I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole, but I also dont like high risk investments.I agree that Africa has untapped potential in that area, but the conditions to allow it to happen/succeed arent coming anytime soon imo.

It only got hyped by yotuber, and was a known scam company before.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 10:55:53'] Mostly a scam. It really exists but it is not used much and is not very profitable. It just doesn't really fill a practical niche, except perhaps for a small number of affluent urban people.The issue is actually not internet penetration. Africa has actually been a leader in internet banking because mobile phone usage exploded and it solved huge issues in areas where you could get mobile coverage but where transportation was poor. Like, for instance, let's say you work in Lagos but your family still lives in a rural area with poor roads. Twenty years ago maybe the only way to support them was to come home a couple times a year and leave a chunk of money, or else send it with friends and hope it gets there. Now you can just do it with your phone. Even in a rural area if you had banking needs maybe it would take a day and you would spend 1/10th of your money in transport to get there. So, if you want to invest in something in this general area I'd recommend mobile phone providers, for instance Africa Airtel.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-04 03:19:12'] The core business of amazon is its servers, not retail, making 3/4 of their revenue if I'm not mistaken. They got another leg, like logistics for other companies, their amazon products (kindle, speakers, etc) and of course prime (music, movies, delivery). So don't look for e-commerce to become a "new amazon" - it will be pretty hard.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-04 05:56:52'] I used to play this amazon of africa thing. Lost 80 percent of my value and dumped it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 02:28:34'] In my limited experience as a customer they seem to have figured some things out, I'm in a somewhat rural place but JMIA delivers to a store in a medium sized city near me and the store works as a pick-up place that they pay per the transaction, so JMIA isn't delivering themselves nor paying staff to stand there waiting for you. In the last earnings report it sounded like they got the founders out and they were bringing in some people to really concentrate on making it profitable instead of being fixated on growth. Including ending some offerings that were leading to losses. But I'd give it a few quarters and want the turnaround to materialize before I consider buying. I see the food delivery drivers everywhere in Kampala but that might still be a money loser overall, stuff like that could definitely be on the chopping block. I think their free delivery membership or something was already getting cut and they were pulling out of some smaller markets. It could definitely be an acquisition target for someone like AMZN or even BABA. The market cap is less than half a billion, so you could justify buying it in large part for the existing familiarity. I think it was Jamie Dimon who said during the initial covid crash that spending on market share in an economic downturn is a lot more effective than spending when the economy is hot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 10:40:05'] Jumia does not have AWS, so it cannot be the Amazon of Africa. In general it seems like a bad idea to invest in intransparent and corrupt markets, even if they grow you as an investor might not reap the rewards.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-04 00:37:15'] We have well developed roads and infrastructure as well as nearly everywhere operating postal carriers like DHL or other more flexible transport and delivery solutions. Africans, sorry for the generalization, are creative and find solutions to a certain lack of infrastructure in rural areas. In villages there are places where packages are delivered which will be further distributed in the village or picked up. Yes transportation is less efficient in rural areas but also there is more and cheaper labor to compensate for that.The picture you painted that in Africa its mainly starving poor people who need to be developed by the global north is racist and not a fact. Have you been to any major city there? They also have airports and infrastructure and comparably rich persons. Yes, it will not be a one to one copy of amazon with huge fullfillment centers in every region, but neither will it be like this in other major regions like in the ASEAN countries. Even in the global north, many products are coming directly from China and will just be delivered by airplane and then with the carrier. You can also have a large product storage facility and processing center near the major airports and products can be sent in many countries and regions.By the way, even if large package carriers don't send to certain rural areas, private persons and small companies do that, for example through buses and bus companies. Stuff ordered online in a big city and the transported by another company to the rural areas. Win and no risk for the e-commerce company....

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-04 03:41:16'] Another point is: one thing is the company being successful or not, and another is the company returning capital to stock holders.You can have a story of success like Spotify, a clear leader in a massive market & at the same time have a terrible stock with no real prospect, spending all their money in stock options and never returning a dividend.Domino's pizza is a famous example of a "cheap" company that treats their investors like Michelin restaurant customers, with growing dividends, buybacks and improving margins all the time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 18:16:37'] Avid cyclist and mechanic here...While I applaud Peloton finally making a decently engineered stationary cycle the static design and position did have me thinking. Before Peloton it was parallel rollers (yikes) or slightly raised rear fans. The former you had to be very conscious of your training line. The latter you needed to put extra wear on the rear tire, clip the front brake and raise the front axle to comp for the rear. Both solutions had risks, but the rollers did seem most natural for the bike to behave.Hindsight 20/20 here I admit. But any stationary bike is going to have huge training forces put on the frame and rider supporting elements. If I rode Peleton like any bike daily before ride inspect the gear. Weekly, I'd take a penlight and go over all the welds and seams. I wish the company well and hope they recover. Bests all, speedy recovery to those injuired. I myself had a bad wrist fracture from a different source, no fun.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 10:59:20'] Home exercise equipment that many purchased during the pandemic has gone through all sorts of horror.Peloton and NordicTrack/ iFIT are the two main companies that sell home bikes/treadmill equipment to home users. They sued each other in 2021/2022 and settled by separating feature sets (for example, peloton has leaderboards and live classes, while NordicTrack does not anymore).Now if you bought a Peloton bike between 2020-2022 as many people did during the pandemic, you have to deal with the fact that your bike seat will likely fail and you’ll find yourself with a metal pole up your bum mid-workout. If you bought a Peloton treadmill, your small child or pet may have been swept underneath and crushed.If you purchased a bike or treadmill from the Peloton competitor NordicTrack as of October 2022, your equipment may not have physically assaulted you, but it will have auto-updated and removed the bootloader from the OS sometime between October 2022-now (it still auto-updates to this today as we experienced). Hard resetting the machine results in the same issue, because as soon as you update, you can no longer boot the device and you’ll see a “Supported API: 3” error code.The resolution for the issue has prompted a separate lawsuit. Many folks have been asked to spend $600-800 on a replacement console if they are out of warranty (illegal). The lead time for this part is 4+ months because it impacted ALL devices purchased within the 2020-early 2022 timeframe.I now have a very expensive 300lb paperweight. The best part is that at this rate, both companies will go under for selling their faulty equipment which cost users thousands.

POST_TEXT: b"Hey everyone, I'm curious to know what the biggest holding in your portfolio is at the moment. Personally, I'm heavily invested in Amazon, as I believe the company's growth potential is still massive, especially in the e-commerce and cloud computing spaces.\n\nBut enough about me - what about you? Are you putting most of your eggs in one basket, or diversifying across multiple stocks or sectors? And what's the rationale behind your largest position - is it a long-term play, a value pick, or a high-growth prospect?\n\nOf course, please keep in mind that this is not a recommendation or endorsement of any particular stock or strategy, and past performance is not indicative of future results. But I'm always interested in hearing different perspectives and learning from fellow investors, so feel free to share your thoughts and experiences.\n\nLet's discuss and learn together!"

I started the year heavy on energy and conservative tech (MSFT, AAPL, BABA, etc), but I bailed on it in the middle of the Jan runup because it started to look overvalued and I'd made enough to be happy with the year.My overriding investment strategy right now is to minimize losses and take wins.  It's working out very well, but I'm hopeful to buy & hold for the long term when things settle down.  I'm comfortable missing the start of a run-up.

Second point is that the US spends the most on healthcare in the world and this amount is growing every year and with new viruses and stuff forming in the world I feel like investing in US healthcare whether ETFs or stocks is a no brainier thing to do. Combine that with the unregulated prescription drugs market in the US and you got a money making machine.

Previous trial in Australia was halted due to tremendous success. Endoxifen is a metabolite of the current standard of care for breast cancer (Tamoxifen) but with far fewer side effects, so high chance of being fast-tracked to market and replacing Tamoxifen ($680M/year market). CEO has made it clear he wants to sell the company to big pharma as soon as possible. Oh and they’re sitting on a mountain of cash (+100M) which is actually more than current market cap (90M). Risky of course, but a steal at current price with 30x upside if the drug goes to market. I’m swinging for the early retirement fence with this one.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/24/amazon-adds-generic-prescription-perk-for-prime-members.html\n\nAmazon on Tuesday announced a new prescription perk for U.S. Prime members, hoping to boost subscriptions and attract users to its pharmacy service.\n\nThe add-on, called RxPass, will allow Prime members to get as many drugs as they need from a list of 50 generic medications to treat more than 80 common chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, anxiety and diabetes. The service costs $5 a month per person, and delivery is free.\n\nAmazon has pushed deeper into health care in recent years. The company launched its own online pharmacy in 2020, a service that was born out of its acquisition of PillPack in 2018. Amazon introduced, then shuttered, a telehealth service called Amazon Care, and announced in July it would acquire boutique primary care provider One Medical.\n\nAmazon also offers a Prime prescription savings benefit, which offers a discount of up to 80% on generic medications and up to '

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 17:05:04'] Silly question - does the $5/month give you access to any of the 50+ drugs part of this program for no additional charge?  Or is it saying since you pay $5/month for RxPass, you qualify for discounted price for these medications?

There is undoubtedly a new console coming very soon.  When the switch released in 2017 the stock was ~$5 in 2018 it was ~$10.  3. When the Nintendo board comes to their senses and realizes the mountains of cash they are leaving on the table by not releasing games on PC there will be a massive bump in sales and margins from digital sales.  Sony did it after years of dragging their feet, so will Nintendo.Edit: So triggered over an opinion lol, great sub

Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZNs IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself wouldve been an impressive feat but it wouldnt be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 10:46:21'] Nice work! I’m curious why you chose to use the 10y treasury note rate as the risk free rate instead of treasury bills. The 10y T-note is not risk free as it bears interest rate risk. 3 month Tbill should be used as that’s virtually risk free. This is the way it’s done in textbooks. So, using the tbill 4.5% rate, your risk premium would be 5.04%, your coe would be 11.2%, and your wacc would be 9.2%. Not a big difference tbf but noteworthy nonetheless
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 02:34:28'] Two things.First. You expect me to read all of this? Seriously? It's all over the place and includes a lot of fluff. In addition, Amazon's financials are very consolidated and don't provide much value at a deep level. Unless you have access to management and spend a lot of time following them and building up financial models over years, there really isn't much that can be done at a detailed level. And I personally wouldn't spend the time to build up detailed financials myself on a company like this because you could probably get 80% of what you need to know about valuation with some very high level assumptions and cursory look at their financial metrics over time. (This isn't the case for all companies however.)Second. $115 vs $85 is a terrible margin of safety on a company like Amazon. Especially in a rising rate environment and the significant risks that you are missing. I would personally want something above 2x to consider betting on the company in this environment. As you get older you'll realize that Amazon isn't really cheap right now and there are probably a lot better plays. Probably someplace in MicroCaps where you can get an advantage and actually understand the components of the business at a more detailed level. It would require a good amount of research, but the exercise would probably be more valuable and illuminating than trying to roll the dice on consolidated financials on a company as large as this one with so many moving pieces and conflicting priorities.In addition, while you write a lot of stuff on here, you don't really understand their strategy or the major issues facing the company. While it is nice to analyze the financials, I think you need to spend more time learning about the business and other business disciplines. Because a lot of the "analysis" is cutting and pasting quotes from management. Many of which aren't really that critical and don't tell you much about the organization.Good luck on your journey.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-17 07:55:58'] I sold both and I won't get in anymore. The big money on these companies have already been made, now it's just for capital preservation. Same as Apple and Microsoft. Amazon has a P/E of 90, it grows revenue at 9% YoY, ROE growth -66%, EBITDA growth -15% and very bad margins. The EBITDA margin is 10% and the Net Income margin is just 2%. With inflation at 7% this company is bleeding money. The e-commerce business can't make money after over 20 years and competition is rising rapidly. And in the cloud business the competition will grow and it's not enough to make Amazon a growth company...but if it's not a growth company anymore how do you justify a P/E of 90?Before investing it's important to make some analysis otherwise it's just a casino bet. Google is a better company but I'm not crazy about ads businesses....I don't even use the Google search engine anymore. Among the Big Cap companies Microsoft and Tesla are without a doubt the best. Microsoft is active in a lot of important division and it's a resilient business....Microsoft Office, Business Intelligence, Cloud, Gaming, Windows, Computers....they are a powerhouse. Tesla is the default company for electric cars and make the best ones. They have a huge backlog and they are doing great in China too and that market is massive......1,5 billion people. Not many big companies have access to that market because of restrictions. And some people don't know it but Tesla is active in the huge (especially in the future) solar business...the potential is massive. But as of now, I'm not invested in any of them. I'm waiting for the recession to enter at a lower price.

Personally I’m just holding onto my TSLA shares and saving cash until inflation comes down, unemployment goes way up, or we see a crazy capitulation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 05:25:06'] They really ought to start paying a dividend (along with Google). At least then they’d have less cash to piss away on silly projects. Shareholders continue to say, “Oh, they’re reinvesting, the cash flows will come”. Microsoft and Apple also reinvest, yet they manage to generate ample free cash flow for dividends and buybacks. When will Amazon’s huge free cash flows appear? Money in the future is worth less than money today, so with each passing year, they’ll need to make that much more cash flow for investors. I think the market is almost certain to be disappointed. E-commerce is low margin and highly competitive. AWS benefited significantly from VC-funded unprofitable companies spending like sailors. As the tech bubble unwinds, so too will the high AWS growth rates.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 09:37:46'] Thanks for the opinion, but I will disagree with your entire thesis.I want them to stay the course. The stuff they are working isnt superfluous BS like most other companies. They are moving toward more efficiency and pushing into staples. I want them to continue.Also  I am about 99% sure they made tons of money on Rivian. Id need to verify but they got in very early. I think they invested about $2.5b and its currently worth well north of $3.5b. Not exactly a big deal to Amazon regardless but you need to consider that its not easy for big companies to take big stakes like this in public companies. This was a success. It gave them a lot of control and they needed eVs. That will save them tons of money on their logistic costs in several regions.

I know that there was a depreciation in stocks, so when questioned my father claimed that "we lost it all", but I know that Amazon\'s stocks quickly appreciated and that people made a lot of money if they had stuck with them during those years, and now Amazon is a multi-million dollar company. Trouble is, my mom doesn\'t have access to the joint bank account where she made the wire transfer, but she swears she made the purchase. How should she go about looking into this? I don\'t fully trust my father, since he\'s also an alcoholic and quite a manipulative person. However, he\'s never been a stock expert either, and we barely have contact.. am I crazy for thinking there\'s something to this?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:55:09'] Just a guess here based on the timeframe, but chances are your mom, if she bought, bought near the peak of AMZN’s run up in 1998-1999 (few people outside the investing world would have thought to buy the stock until it started making headlines). If that’s the case, your parents would have seen their investment fall from $6000 to roughly $1200 after September 11th. If your dad’s assessment “we lost it all” is correct, it’s possible they sold at or near the bottom for fear of it going to zero. It’s hard to believe that they held on because that $6000 would have turned into more than ~$24,000 by 2013, and would have been a somewhat significant marital asset when they divorced. Hard to imagine missing that. It’s possible the stock was sold at that time and the money divided based on how they agreed to split their assets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 09:44:56'] So you are trying to access the account that contains the stocks but you are not allowed to?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 13:09:24'] If your mom bought about $6k of Amazon around 1998-1999 it’s probably worth around $600k today if she and your dad didn’t sell it. She would need to find out where she bought it and what brokerage is holding on to it now. If she can track all that down she might be able to find it. States also have a law that after a certain number of years of no contact the state holds onto the assets as a interest free loan. So she may want to check with the state that would have been on the account to see if they’re holding onto it for her.

As a fellow trader, Amazon is probably not a bad buy here, but you should be eyeing Google if you're looking to trade off big tech because Google is likely very oversold here. I would buy Google here and once it corrects, I would take some profits off and perhaps look at Amazon then.Even if you think Google isn't oversold from this past week and you expect it to drop further, you should hold your cash and wait for when you do think it's oversold. It's a great opportunity for a nice trade here. I only mention Google because it's big tech like Amazon.Disclosure, I have a huge stake in both Amazon and Google as of right now.

If we fail to get back over 4100, likely keep falling back to 4000 and get back to its 52 week low at which I would say that’s an actual strong buying opportunity.

Of course I’m not buying blind just based on the scanner there is still additional analysis that needs to be done but I am a swing trader. So I was buying options that are generally in the money and expire 14-28 days out depending on the premium and volatility of the stock. Funny enough I just looked at my sheet and never actually bought AMZN last year. I generally agree that these big tech stocks don’t follow MA too well but there are other industry sectors that respect MAs a lot more. End of the day point is you can’t buy blind based on something just like a MA cross. That would be too easy and everyone would be rich.  Good luck out there!

I can’t imagine what kind of unintended consequences would result from a blanket ban for life or even just while the individual is working for the government. The problem is there’s no good solution.

Even on the high end that averages 10k measly dollars, lower end 2k, per employeeThey fluffed it up by giving total dollars which sounds bad but I want to see a breakdown of averages. This isn't Pelosi level insider trading. While it should be stopped I'm not sure it needs to be punished as it's such large scale and seemingly average people just trying to get a leg up in life.I'm willing to bet more than half of us would try this knowing it's unlikely to get caught if it's not a huge amount.

If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS & not their retail side. \n\nFor example:\n\nUber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence & its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable & likely never will be.\n\nTSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking & getting closer to all other car manufacturers.\n\nNVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:41:02'] Your point about NVDA doesn’t make sense. More powerful GPUs are unlocking more powerful AI applications.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:31:12'] This isn't a tech vs. non tech issue, but more of one where people see "growth(!!!!)" and then don't think about what it might grow into. Tesla is a great example of that in that it there are companies that one can see as 85th percentile outcome (Mercedes) and 99.5th percentile outcomes (Toyota) and then 99.9999 percentile outcomes (somehow much bigger than Toyota) and find that all the valuations of these excellent outcomes are already more than priced in. Its one thing when there is something totally new--like, who knows with this internets thingy how big petsdotcom could get--but shouldn't be ignored when you are dealing with more or less known industries.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:23:40'] Ok... You gave some examples of tech companies which don't deserve their valuations. Which tech companies *do* deserve their valuations?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:16:10'] Totally agree on Uber, even more goes for Doordash and the like. At least Uber started out undercharging rides to undercut the market, there was a real benefit to the service they offered vs historic methods.(Sidebar: anyone remember Uber and Lyft leaning hard into driverless cabs? Imagine that was a fruitless money sink, Tesla has more chance of creating that service, given that is a pipe-dream now, any justification for tech sector prices left with it)Food delivery services on the other hand have inserted themselves into a system and take significant margin from take-out services, under pay their staff and triple charge customers (increased menu prices vs. phoning an order in, platform service charge and increasing tip need to even get it delivered).  Beyond a joke they can’t make money despite screwing every party of the transaction over.What room do they have to grow to make profitability? The service is already falling apart.Couldn’t even make money during the pandemic… smh. That’s a sector crying out for AI, just put delivery costs out to bid based on live demand vs supply (let the drivers pick the pay rate they’ll take) run a delivery support service only, integrate with existing delivery services (Uber etc) /rant over, fuck doordash
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 22:54:50'] Meta is overvalued imo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 07:13:40'] Translation: I missed the move and justify my lack of participation due to “valuation” concerns.Same thing Cathie Wood said when she dumped NVDA and missed out on billions.“It’s not going to end well” is another thing we tell ourselves to make us feel better about missing moves.The valuation of a company is the price of its stock. Last I checked you can’t get paid for a low PE ratio.Nvidia is insanely overvalued based on standard analysis but it can remain this way for a long time. When institutions fall in love with a stock it’s not a trend you want to fight.This is the undisputed leader in the hottest industry that is hungrier and hungrier for GPUs and software to leverage them. Investing is not about being right, it’s about buying stocks that go up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:59:13'] None of these posts really have an intimate understanding of why GPUs are crucial to ML nor how ML works.Our economy has been turbo-blasted by deep learning since roughly 2000. The reason why wasn't some fundamental breakthrough in computer science, it was because we finally had enough compute to make these large scale networks learn and interpolate without it taking forever. Deep learning impacted the economy because HARDWARE got better. We've had the "recipe" for deep learning since like the 50s.Similarly, LLMs aren't really all that different from deep learning and the idea has been "around" for a while. The most impactful breakthrough was the discovery of something called "attention" and "transformers" but this is really just an interation in the something called a recurrent neural network, which again is something that's been around since the 1970s. So again, the reason for this compute is HARDWARE related.If data is the new oil, then GPUs (or better yet TPUs or other ML focused architectures) are the pump jack.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:24:50'] If you see people throwing in “tech valuation” as a conversation when their business has no good fundamental basis, you know they are stretching it.This is given that valuation is based on business fundamentals such as growth, margin, returns on equity etc., or other metrics such as users as a guesstimate of the potential.These companies (NVIDIA, etc.) may have stretched PE with very optimistic investors, but it is not necessarily because of “tech valuation”. After all, large part of the valuation of a growth company is in the future.

Like nvdia with the around 200 PE ratio. Come on, anyone who buys a stock at that PE is just asking for trouble. I know I will be downvoted for this but it is plain stupidity to buy any stock over 40-50 PE. Look back at IBM how many poeple bought into it in its height. Or any dotcom stock back then. Sell at this high price while you can, it won't be like this forever. And yes give me downvotes, if I can help at least one person with this post not to lose more than 50% of their portfolio because of a crazy overvalued stock I would take it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 11:09:51'] - Marvel hasn't been the same after Endgame. Comic book shows/movies fatigue is real.- It's evident Disney is clearly running out of new ideas with all these live-action adaptation that the majority of their subs don't really ask for. - Star Wars only caters to its ardent fanbase which I imagine is smaller Marvel's and Disney's. I gather the die hard fans from the 80s arent that enthusiastic about the spin-offs. - Honest question. What about Anime? Maybe they can add this to their lineup? Anime is still growing in the West and is watched by many adults as well. Netflix got it right adding a lot of Anime in their already gigantic catalog.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 09:01:23'] The D+ customer base was always questionable because of all the free and discounted accounts. I want to see where they land once its no longer such. Im honestly am not a fan of D+ content either. Tbh, I havent enjoyed a Marvel movie since the original Spiderman and XMen movies. I also liked the old Punisher show and to a lesser extend, Luke Cage and Daredevil. The X-Men needed a TV show (rather than all the copy cat teams). But point is content is a bit sparse for adults though I will admit they are doing a decent job with SW shows... though the movies were major suck.The other issue I have with them is I dont like Iger and never did in the old days either. To me he is responsible for that terrible fox deal and the low margins now.Not worried about Disney overall. Their margins are still under pressure due to inflation and spending but its just a matter of time to figure them out. Once they have adjusted I expect to see $13b net in short order, maybe in 2025. Basically back to 2018/19 level plus another $1b. That would put us at about 13 PE and I think those numbers are rather conservative at that. The upside potential is much higher.Debt is a concern but again... thats was due to the bad Iger deal before he bolted. Its being paid down rather quickly so thats good. Hopefully Iger doesnt screw the pooch on managing that.Ill keep my shares. Small position in my case but I like their long term outlook.

We have reduced spending on orders in anticipation of lower demand (with a noticeable difference in Q2 - our purchases for raw materials has been down nearly 30% from Q1). I won’t comment on the industry I work in, but our main customers are large publicly traded companies in the SP500. Not to sound doom and gloom, but I believe Q2 earnings will take a hit despite a good outlook from companies on its current Q1 reports. I anticipate a recovery would be in the late ‘23 leading into ‘24.

I hope the studios make the right concessions that help writers to end the strike quickly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 13:53:46'] ### Atlanta GDP Now: 2.7% for Q2> The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the second quarter of 2023 is **2.7 percent** **on May 4**, **up from 1.8 percent on May 1**. After recent releases from the US Census Bureau, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Institute for Supply Management, the nowcasts of second-quarter real personal consumption expenditures growth and second-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth increased from 1.3 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, to 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, while the nowcast of the contribution of the change in real net exports to second-quarter real GDP growth decreased from 0.38 percentage points to 0.31 percentage points.It's true jobs got revised down in the earlier parts of the quarter. I'm not sure how much that matters for forward-looking stocks. Market is not going to care if Q1 gets revised down to 0.5% growth or something, and Q2 comes in strong. In any case, even if jobs growth slowed down in February/March, the unemployment rate *decreased* and wages came in hot, so it didn't appear to have much of an impact.----Irrelevant portfolio comments: Nice strong day. Coal names benefited from the rising market, with AMR rising nearly 6% and wiping out my losses. Very excited for Monday's earnings. If I had to pick the stock I was most bullish on in my entire portfolio right now (at current prices), it would be AMR.BTU + 3.6%, FCX (copper) +3.6%. Small cap value boomed for once, with AVUV +3.1%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 15:51:21'] u/AP9384629344432 Thanks for sharing the great [bloomberg article about the massive $42B increase in bank loans in the latest weekly data.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/us-bank-lending-increased-for-a-fourth-straight-week?srnd=markets-vp&leadSource=uverify%20wall)Largest increase since December, just wow. Driven a ton by small banks ~$31B!!!  I feel like this completely debunks the whole credit crunch by regional and small banks thesis.Even if deposits went down I wouldn't actually be worried as long as credit was flowing heartily like it is.  We expect that deposits might shrink and that just means bank profits shrink a bit due to more expensive funding costs like brokered CDs.  But even then, excluding foreign institutions deposits, US actually went up 😂!I actually have had many long back and forth arguments with CRE doomers about office loans.  While class D properties have really taken a hit in values, many banks actually have pretty conservative LTVs and can absorb losses.  Moreover, it doesn't matter as long as banks are willing to renew loans or borrowers can refi elsewhere...  "It isn't a loss until you sell" actually applies to debt too.  It isn't a default as long as coverage ratios look healthy and the debt can be serviced (even with reduced occupancy), with loans extended or renewed.  Vacancies are slowly improving and eventually they will catch up.

That on top of likely an increase is trading due to btc surging likely means stronger consumer trust and a decent quarter for coinbase. I wouldn’t short it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 15:01:29'] Unlimited downside on a stock that is heavily tied to a volatile and unpredictable class of assets. Between now and earnings crypto could do just about anything and cause a short position to blow up. Not that I believe that to be a likely outcome, but it is possible. We have seen crazy crypto runs in the past and will likely see them in the future as well at some point. And even if it is not likely I have zero interest in exposing myself to that level of risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 18:20:44'] I think being short COIN is probably the right move, except it also exists in the cryptosphere.If BTC pumps COIN will rally in sympathy.  I think it will probably work out, but there are probably better short option
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 13:11:09'] The crypto exchanges actively trade against their users, participating in such a market makes no sense. While $COIN is not a shitcoin so it won’t directly be manipulated, it’s price tends to follow BTC’s which *is.*
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 14:58:31'] Coinbase has a lot of troubles ahead. Bitcoin halving, the lawsuit about staking, the looming student debt bubble that will pop, and the suspicion behind Tether propping up the price of Bitcoin...there are too many things to type out here.The number one problem is that Coinbase has no real scalability. That's weird to say, and the crypto bros will be responding to my comment in earnest about their visions of the future, but the real fact is Coinbase is directly tied to the value of BTC because the majority of their revenue comes from percentage based transaction fees that fluctuate so wildly with crypto market changes. Bitcoin halving will be an absolute deathblow to their current structure. Miners are going to drop like flies with lower rewards, and transaction fees MUST increase to account for the hash demand. Coinbase already has the highest fees of any exchange that their customers don't necessarily appreciate. They're going to need to cut some pretty big deals with their corporate partnerships if they want to keep business. As for retail traders, I don't know what they can do. Curious to see how it plays out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 03:17:02'] The argument for shorting is always the same:"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."I'd not go there personally; seems like a decent gamble though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 04:43:47'] There's a few. First off, COIN has taken a huge beating of late and has shown strong resistance at the $50 - $60 mark, a lot of negatives are already baked in at that price to the point you won't find many sellers IMO.The BIG reason to be careful about shorting is one that no one has mentioned (as far as I can see) and that could crush a short position - the **Ripple v SEC lawsuit**. I won't go into all the details, but basically its a court case which has the potential to send an earthquake through the cryptosphere. If Ripple wins there will a big upshoot on the value of all crypto and the opposite if they lose - summary judgement should happen over the coming weeks/next couple of months. Finally, Bitcoin has doubled in value since the last earnings and COIN have made staffing cuts I could be wrong, but I think they'll post a nice PES in the next Q.

They do not matter to today's stock price. The question is are the traffic figures going to start falling faster or slower in the future? The business model has extremely robust gross margins so traffic and trading activity is everything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 10:21:44'] The problem I see is that, even if you are right to short it, getting the timing right is incredibly hard.It may run wild when you short making you lose all your money. And you might be proven right after a few months.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/27/disney-layoffs-bob-iger-memo.html\n\nDisney will begin layoffs this week, the first of three rounds before the beginning of the summer that result in about 7,000 job cuts, according to a memo sent by Chief Executive Bob Iger.\n\nThe cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce corporate spending and boost free cash flow. Disney said last month it plans to cut $5.5 billion in costs, including $3 billion in content spend.\n\nThis week, we begin notifying employees whose positions are impacted by the companys workforce reductions, Iger wrote in the memo, which was obtained by CNBC. Leaders will be communicating the news directly to the first group of impacted employees over the next four days. A second, larger round of notifications will happen in April with several thousand more staff reductions, and we expect to commence the final round of notifications before the beginning of the summer to reach our 7,000-job target.\n\nThe layoffs were initially announced i'

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 13:25:13'] I never liked Chapek but Iger screwed Disney by making too many acquisitions (creating too much debt) and losing too much money on streaming. He handed this problem to Chapek, who actually fixed this at the expense of his reputation. He increased park revenues beyond expectation (via Genie+ and Lightning Lane) and increased the price of Disney+ going against Iger’s goal. Disney could then pay down some debt, which is something like 40b. Chapek was then ousted (costing Disney money) and replaced by Iger who will also be expensive and to what benefit? Now Iger is firing employees and isn’t reversing anything Chapek did showing that Chapek was right. Iger was never a visionary and bought his way through Hollywood. The Disney Board is a complete disaster and needs to bring on someone who understands the Disney “magic”

The tests are currently limited to shuttling Zoox employees on a one-mile public route between two office buildings at the companys headquarters in Foster City, California, at speeds up to 35 miles an hour. The company hasnt said how big its test fleet is, but executives have said they have built dozens of vehicles, although fewer than 100.\n\n'

POST_TEXT: b'E-commerce software and services provider Shopify ($SHOP) suddenly looks a lot different to investors in the wake of a strategy shift. Canada-based Shopify in early June completed the sale of its fulfillment unit, easing investor angst over rising investments for SHOP stock.\r  \n\r  \nWith the move, Canada-based Shopify slashed capital spending and improved its financial outlook.\r  \n\r  \n"Post the recent \'shape shift\' where it exited the logistics business and reduced over 20% of the workforce, the company is free cash flow positive," said UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar in a recent report.\n\n  \n**Covid Emergency E-Commerce Boost**\r  \nFurther, Shopify stock has jumped 90% in 2023 as of June 14.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 07:15:13'] I have some shares in Shop, some bought a few years ago, and some bought near the peak. But I still don't know what to do with them.As someone who runs a small mostly online e-comm business, I think it's a great platform, probably the best option for most small and medium size businesses. But I still don't know how valuable a company it is.As I see it there's 3 categories of e-comm companies1. Small startups or mom n pop stores that want an online presence2. Established or Mid-size e-comm companies3. Large e-comm companies and established brands or B&M storesI think that group 1 seems to be Shopify's biggest target market, but I see that as being doomed to fail, as 90% of those companies won't be able to make money online when they realise that the biggest challenge and cost online isn't the platform/ website design, it's marketing and getting people on to your site.Group 2 - this is where Shopify may succeed long term - BUT those companies will be looking for better pricing as they grow. Shopify isn't cheap on payment processing fees for example, even on their expensive tiers. As other platforms improve (e.g. BigCommerce), I suspect Shopify will become engaged in a race to the bottomGroup 3 - These companies care less about Shopify's ease of set up etc.. and they probably don't like being tied in with a company with less flexibility, who will have all their own policies etc.. They have more options available to them (Magento, Drupal, Bigcommerce). Larger companies will be more heavily focused on price, flexibility etc.. which aren't Shopify's biggest strong points.Shopify has been doing a big marketing push bragging about how easy it is to set up a store with them. However, most of those startup store owners will discover how little benefit that really is in the highly competitive online world, where it's all about visibility and marketing. **Having a nice looking website is no longer the hard part.** I suspect long term, more and more traffice (and revenue) will go through the big stores and marketplaces. As soon as a small startup succeeeds - they'll start looking to migrate from Shopify to save money and have more flexibility
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 17:40:01'] Shopify is booting lots of retailers right now to the point bigcommerce us picking up clients and referring to themselves as the place for shopify refugees. You can't start a business on shopify and be confident theybwont destroy your business. This is bad for shopifybif it becomes more widespread or known about. To be clear were not talking about shopify payments were talking about shopify acting like ebay or Amazon dictating what legal products you can and can't sell
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 22:32:32'] I had a couple people working for them as software developers and they said they have never seen a worse run company than them. And they said that independent from each other and without any spite. That’s why I would never invest.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 06:58:37'] They bought One Medical recently, likely doesn't make sense to offer multiple products. I still think there's a bull case for their healthcare endeavors eventually.Telemedicine is here to stay, but there's a lot of growing pains. So many of the telemedicine services out there are absolute shit from a medical care standpoint. No idea about Amazon Care as I don't work for Amazon, but many of the telemedicine services have just been focused on patient acquisition instead of solid medical care. I foresee a lot of telemedicine services faltering or consolidating.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 07:18:09'] All the people here who think Amazon is abandoning healthcare, wowowow. Surface-level thinking. They’re absolutely doing healthcare and I can almost guarantee you’ll interact with their services at some point in the next five years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 14:57:40'] Telehealth is a commodity. They will acquire a built in network with OneMedical with over 8,000 ready made connections with employers and can just slap on telehealth from within OneMedical and not have to start from scratch. The telehealth rage today is akin to back in the late 1990s where anyone who had a .com after its name was hyped. Today, every business has .com behind its name.

Worst is WHR (Warehouse REIT). It was a growth stock for a while (they specialise in last mile warehouses), but the share price dropped off with Amazon’s own share price declining and then the rise in interest rates gave it another kick. Long term, I think it’ll recover and grow again - so long as the debt doesn’t eat too much into profits

I put a little fun money in a startup that focused on clean energy fuel sources. I only gave it about $100 but thankfully that was all I lost. Bought in on what turned out to be a high of like $6 a share, when predictions were saying it would likely triple that in a year. Covid stalled out the company's projects, it dropped to penny stocks barely hitting 10 cents a share by the end of it. They ended up doing some crazy reverse split to try and get themselves back over a dollar in share price and I got cashed out for everything I had for like $2.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 08:23:12'] Worst: dumped about 9k into BSV at the very height of the crypto boom 2021. Had no knowledge of investing, trading, crypto, BTC, nothing - thought if you buy something that has increased a lot in price historically, just hold it until it's increased more before you sell, you're golden. I was deeply wrong and learned the hard way. I was also really into the idea of saving on taxes by holding for at least a year before selling anything. This led to my first mistake of not getting out of that horrible investment the 1 single time BSV experienced a peak high enough for me to have broken even.  Second mistake, became discouraged by BSV's pretty contstant trajectory downward from there (plus learning more and more about the total scam and lie that was BSV) and missed plenty of opportunities to average down and get out. After a couple of years, RH (my broker for that trade) delisted BSV and due to restrictions in my state, I had no option to transfer coins out off the platform so was forced to sell at a massive loss of about 90%. Learnings: a ton, but top learnings - DO THE RESEARCH. DD is non-negotioable. Read the charts for entries, don't just jump in. Understand the context before taking risk. Understand the risk itself - examine every possible scenario regarding the fundamentals of the asset & the contract you are entering with the trade. Understand the very real risks of delisting and what your backup plan will be. Understand the full scope of entry/exit plans before you put your capital on the line. Learned a lot from this deeply expensive lesson, and it hurt bad. Still does.Best: Have been keeping my sizable savings in t-bills and t-bill ETFs to take advantage of current high rates on short termers. Doesn't yield a whole lot but it's like a tax-advantaged savings account for me until I feel ready to jump into riskier assets. Feel great about this decision as it was extremely well-informed and I understand exactly what I'm doing with it. From worst to best, I see myself on a great trajectory towards future success.

Got liquidated in my sleep when Biden dumped loads of oil onto market from strategic reserves. Probably the best thing that happened to me as it happened very early on. I don’t day trade anymore. More of an investor / swing trader. Don’t use more than 2x now and try to not get into anything I don’t understand. I feel sorry for the people that get lucky a few times, get a false sense of ability, then get rekt. At least I learned my lesson early on, took my medicine and moved on.

Then bought about 2k of calls a few weeks before the merger which ended up jumping 400%. Not nearly as big of a gain in dollars, but it felt like absurdly easy money as I was already dialled into the ticker.Worst - BEI.UN about 10 years ago, bought around $60, sold around $40 years later. Gained a little in divs, but lost around 10k if I remember correctly. Also lost the potential gains of that wasted money if I just bought something better.For total finance, Best was buying and holding ETFs for like 95% of my portfolio, then rebalancing quarterly and maxing my registered accounts.

If you're looking at 10 year horizon, just check in every so often and you've got nothing to worry about. That's the difference between gambling and investing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-22 08:46:02'] Hold this stock for the rest of your life. It’s an amazing investment. Amazon is and will continue to be a global leader in many sectors. I’d argue that AWS alone is worth ~$100 per share. Amazons business model and relation to shareholders is one of a kind. No one is expecting positive earnings and consequently no dividends from this company. That gives amazon a huge competitive advantage as they can reinvest 100% of the capital. No taxable income and no money lost in tax for paying shareholders.

You don't buy Amazon because of its dividends payout (because duh, they don't pay dividends). You buy amazon because of the value of the business, hold Amazon FOREVER, you won't regret it, even if by the end of the year is down 70%, do not panic sell, Amazon has everything to keep succeeding.

So you can DCA, buying more shares as it drops and continue to hold your higher priced shares until everything blows over.  You can sell, take the loss and wait for a better entry point when it pulls back further.  I would DCA and continue to buy.  I have an average share price of 124.01.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-22 14:30:57'] This kind of comment is usually down voted, but still worth saying IMO.What you did is called gambling. You bet that if you bought stock about a company you know little about, it would increase in price. It didn't.Investing, on the other hand, is usually long term. And even then, it's not guaranteed to be safe. You find a company with good fundamentals and potential and put your money in it. Now, is Apple that company? It really depends on what YOU want. Apple's the biggest strength (and weakness) is that it's almost a cult. Just like Coke VS Pepsi, people decide that Apple is better and are willing to spend much more than they would otherwise for a comparable product.And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. All brands based on luxury and upscaling do it. Starbucks, Tesla, Dom Perignon, Armani, Rolex, Bose.. they are all good, some really good, but not as good as the price reflects. There are comparable products for a fraction of the price.So that strategy is great. While people have extra money to spend. In times when the economy isn't doing so well, people are concerned about rent, gas and groceries and not about the phone that will make you look wealthy. So Apple doesn't have the brightest near future but it still is a very solid company. A  recession is looming and inflation is starting to take a toll. Any company that offers over-inflated products won't do well for a while.So if you want to consider it an investment that in the short-term isn't doing well, it's your choice. But you're going to have to hand in there until the market changes. Think years. And embrace the risk. It might never go back to where it was (personally I think it will, in a few years).On the other hand,  you can just call it a bad gamble, sell the position and go home, just like you would at a casino. No shame in that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-22 14:45:30'] If selling at a loss is off the table, your options are either DCA down (I hate to break it to ya, but I'm pretty sure Amazon is at least 30% overvalued) and ride it back up after it bottoms out at around 80/share (also pretty sure that's the very bottom) or you can hold on for dear life as it goes down further and continue to hold as it takes its sweet ass time (at 12%/year if your lucky plus the time it takes to bottom out - 2 or 3 years) to return back to what you bought it for and then hold more to actually feel like the money you made was worth it.   Regardless of what you choose, maybe take that time to learn more about the markets and how to properly evaluate stocks before you go throwing all your money into the market and especially at large-cap hype stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-05 07:53:21'] As a longtime shareholder, this is pretty disappointing, but I guess not surprising given the last 2 years. Their CEO has constantly harped on this idea that the company was working to automate the home and rid us of the burdens of house chores, yet, after 30 years of existence, they only offer products for one.For years they teased their lawnmower, just to cancel its launch at the last moment. I should have sold then, but held hoping that once they got to the other side of supply chain issues they'd use their cash and years of R&D investment to finally launch a new product. I guess not. Looks like this grand idea of home automation was lip service to investors looking for a growth stock. The sale to amazon pretty much confirms this.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 10:13:48'] AI isn't a hype cycle, but I'd say consumer AI is maybe a hype cycle. B2B and backend AI has been going on for 5+ years. ChatGPT and some of these other apps/tools brought it to consumers, but businesses have been fine tuning and using it for awhile. Only now are the models being available. I'm more interesting in finding the B2B companies that are using it for mega cost savings. &#x200B;Can PWC or E&Y use it to reduce their auditors count by half? Can city inspectors/architects use it to reduce workload for non-compliant blueprints. The companies selling shovels are already known, but I haven't seen the list of up and coming mid-caps with huge potential now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 10:09:35'] In my opinion, the companies with the largest datasets will prevail - GOOG=BIDU > APPL> AMZN=BABA > MSFT=META but there will also be industry specific players (like healthcare , possibly UNH or defense maybe PLTR, travel = BKNG, retail (specifically grocery) - any large chains with loyalty program (they know a lot about you and your preference).  I would also not rule out Bloomberg as they have immense financial data and how companies interrelate as I expect they are already using it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 12:51:56'] Another undervalued sector that will greatly benefit from AI is genomics. Think EXAS, CRSP, DNA, TDOC. Massive data sets + AI to sift through these data sets = profit? probably maybe.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 05:05:23'] It's a very uneven economy - if you look at the indeed jobs data, SF tech jobs surged to a massive peak last year and fell off hard. All those little startups have been struggling and not hiring. On the other hand, masses of rich people moved to cheaper flyover cities creating demand for housing, materials, goods and services. On the other other hand, places like California have a huge bank balance after all the tech boom tax from last year, and are going to spew it out on infra projects creating local demand over the next 2 years. Conversely, the cheaper states the rich people moved to now have a higher, more demanding population, no money, and decreased federal cash. So I wouldn't write off cali just yet.

It only becomes evident in hindsight after the stock blows up and then you kick yourself for not buying earlier.

Steve reinvigorated that company. I mean it was dead weight even through the 90s and into the early 2000s. So the first option is a company that rebuilds itself into something like that. Like if intel just magically got their act together or who knows? So that's option one the second one is some disruptive business. People are looking at EV charging stations as a potential boom cycle but I kind of wonder how much growth and valuation you can really put in a gas station? I don't think we really have any clear leadership yet because we don't even know what the leadership sector is going to be for the next bull market. Right now it's commodities, but commodity cycles never last that long. I think 2005 to 2008 was probably one of the longer ones

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 16:55:00'] The only paradigm shift I see is telemedicine overtaking traditional delivery of medical care and the transition to 'hospital at home'. In Healthcare were still stuck in many ways in the past century, brick and mortar visits, measuring vitals and health in an office or hospital. The population is aging far beyond what the Healthcare system is build to handle and far beyond what it can scale to meet the future demands. There's no way around it that I can see.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 18:47:34'] I think that Tesla, Apple, and Amazon will continue to do really well over the next decade.But I think that the big stock of the decade will be Nvidia since they are involved in several big emerging industries (cloud services, autonomous driving, IoT, crypto, artificial intelligence, genomics, metaverse, etc.).No matter what you imagine the future will be like, at the core of those fantasies will be computing power which Nvidia will be providing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 09:32:37'] Might be better to look at what the hot new thing might be.I hate to admit it, but possibly that's virtual reality stuff.  Maybe they get over their hurdles of being an expensive geek toy, and take over the world, like computers did.  Trouble is computers started out being useful, and then became a toy.  What started as a toy and became useful?  Phones maybe?Trouble with investing in this space is Meta is just a hard nope.    Their hugeness and their history, mean it won't be them, they had their time in the son, and made a mess of it.MSFT is kind of a secret player here.  Could be what they were thinking when buying Activision.  They have branded goggles.  They have Teams.   They have a gaming ecosystem.  They are well positioned, but, they are big name, last wave's news.     Same with AAPL, like they made pocket computers cool, and desperately need something new to continue to justify their price.  If anyone can bring this stuff to the masses, it's them.  This next thing though is already priced in, everyone has AAPL because they think AAPL is going to do something cool again, like with the Mac and then the iPhone.What you'd want though, which I don't see or know about, is the scrappy little company that hasn't made it yet that becomes the dominant player in this space, like TSLA or Spotify did.     That might be the next thing to watch for.  On the other hand, has that company already been bought by a big player?   Has the world changed so we don't get a new whatever, it's at best the brand of a big player?As for something else, I wish I knew.  What's the problem that needs to be solved, and who's solving it in some clever way?

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 17:40:58'] The problem is that these stocks you listed, when they were “cheap”, was not the sure thing like they are today. Tesla at one point in time had continuous production delays, losses every quarter, and on the verge of bankruptcy. Investing at that time was risky. Elon himself said they were very close to going under. Any potential 10 bagger will have its own risks. I would recommend looking at some of the Chinese equities, jd for example. If things go right and regulatory fud goes away, could be a big winner.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 22:28:06'] NVIDIA. I believe their work with AI and the massive head start they’ve had will make them a dominant force in the tech industry once AI begins to directly get into the hands of consumers. They’ve developed AI for self driving cars, have used machine learning to automate a lot of tasks developers, engineers and designers would normally have to do manually. The other day, I realized I could use the NVIDIA AI to reduce noise in my microphone, as well as upscale the resolution of games. While these are small applications that won’t convince most investors, NVIDIA has pivoted in recent years to completely embrace artificial intelligence and deep learning and are moving the company in that direction. Once self driving cars, automated traffic and smart factories become the norm, you can expect NVIDIA to be even more of a juggernaut in the tech industry.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 06:54:01'] Like you said in your edit, it's most likely not already a big 500b+ company like the ones in your title.My call is it will be NIO. [Here](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-chinas-electric-drive-swappable-car-batteries-2022-03-24/) is an article that reflects my thinking. The whole EV industry acts as if fast charging is going to "improve" and that battery swapping is irrelevant. Those who make those claims completely miss the point and ignore reality. Charging speed could improve, but it could also get worse. "How is that possible?" you and every moron Telsa Boi might ask. Well, it's simple. There are already batteries in existence that can allow a Tesla to go over 750 miles on a single charge. Why hasn't Tesla implemented these? Longer charge times and faster degradation. The "longest range" batteries require materials that only last for a few recharge cycles so putting them in a Tesla would mean the car would only last a couple years before the battery was completely wiped out. NIO will never have that problem. They will always be able to use the latest and greatest battery technology - even if that means single-use batteries (which do exist btw) that have some crazy 2500 mile range. Tesla does not have that flexibility. Tesla has to worry about how many recharge cycles the battery can withstand without significant degradation and so they are forced to forgo certain battery configurations that would allow them to achieve 750 mile range. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM are not researching battery swap tech because they believe that is not what the market wants, because the market leader (Tesla) says so. Everyone is just following Papa Elon's lead like he's Einstein. Newsflash: Even Einstein was wrong sometimes. The fact that the whole industry is blindly playing follow the leader should tell you something.Also, Tesla's P/S is about 30x, while NIO's P/S is less than 10x even though Tesla is a megacap company and NIO is only $25B (normally, growth stage companies have much higher P/S because their sales are expect to "grow" while larger companies have lower P/S because their sales are approaching maturity)..In the next 5 years, NIO is going to flood the US market with premium quality low cost EVs and everyone's going to say "I missed NIO but at least I didn't invest in Tesla"
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 07:38:29'] The best way to try and find this is start with a screen. 1) <$20 billion market capNext, what are the financial qualities of a "decade" stock? Revenue growth. This is tricky though since COVID skewed results both up and down but you will still have many companies. 2) 5 year annual revenue growth >20%Good balance sheet. None of the companies mentioned in the original thread ever had any material debt.3) Debt/MktCap < .2It is hard to get the list much smaller with quantitative measures without eliminating potential contenders.The nest step is really about picking the industry that will see the next winner.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 18:44:51'] Recalls like this for minor issues happen all the time. Toyota issues millions of recalls a year like this, but no one ever hears about it because it's normal.I'm not saying rivian is a good investment, I'm just trying to put it in perspective. I consider this recall to be a complete non-event. If you were waiting to buy it, and rivian stock dips because of it, well then you're getting it on sale.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 18:45:34']  They aren't dependent on EV or Rivian in any way. What would the red flag be ? If none of them are ever produced it doesn't affect AMZN.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 18:46:27'] this is a non issue.  car manufacturing and safety is heavily regulated in north america and the west for that matter, so Rivian is required to recall and repair the issue.Further, its a fastener issue, that simply requires torqing down to specification - perhaps later on they change fastener.so, if Amazon bought 100k vans, and all of them had the issue - they would simply call up their dealer rep (they prob will have the fleet agent on speed dial) and start arranging for recall repairs and inspections of the fleet.  Further, they should have a fleet redundancy (come on its amazon!) where a certain percentage of the fleet can be down for service etc without affecting delivery and service.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 05:06:56'] “ recalls are normal “ … yes but traditional brands are way way more capable of handling it without disrupting business . If Rivian gets a time consuming recall it could hurt their quarterly goals and really miss estimates with such low volume .
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 23:18:36'] Recalls are common, but do Rivian even make any money with R1Ts? Especially after the failed price hike of preorders.Recalls will eat into their razor thin margin.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 07:11:23'] Go to the Rivian sub forum and read the reviews from those who had the recall. It took them 3 minutes of pulling into a service station and turning the wheel left and then right while they torqued it down.  Didn’t even leave the vehicle.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 02:24:45'] Recalls are pretty common for every manufacturer. My BMW has been recalled twice in the four years I've had it. At this point I think it's just a reason for them to drag customers into the showroom.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 05:15:25'] Blips like this are not affecting long term strategy of a company, so while Rivian stock may take some interim hit no sane investor should ever sell stock for this recall alone.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 05:21:44'] No issue.  Recalls are normal.  Amazon will be fine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 05:36:29'] Wait, this isn't really a partnership for Amazon - Amazon will just be adding Rivian vans to their fleet.  With the amounts that the current line-up of vans have had recalls and issues, I am not seeing the challenge here.  In fact, considering that most vehicles have recalls these days, the boost of Amazon buying 100,000 should help Rivian, and should allow Amazon to continue operations in California.  With California's laws prohibiting more and more IC vehicles, what choice would Amazon have?  I guess there's BYD, but they don't yet make delivery vans from what I've seen.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 06:14:24'] I just took my Ford Explorer in for an airbag recall. Amazon uses Ford Transits. Their deliveries were earlier than expected this week. I see no correlation between the recalls and ability to deliver. They are already using Rivian vans near me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 11:53:24'] This has not much effect on Amazon as this kind of thing happens all the time with all vendors, where things are not made perfect. In the auto industry, this type of recall is very normal, and Rivian is still a company that is establishing its manufacturing process.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 13:34:26'] non-issue.It's actually GOOD NEWS that they found this earlier than later so they can fix it ASAP. Cars are heavily regulated for obvious reasons. Even if something has a .001% chance of failure, to avoid a lawsuit, they will issue a recall.The valuation of the company is an entirely separate discussion. The recall is a non-factor because every auto company will eventually go through it. It's part of how manufacturing works when you deal with safety.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 14:36:12'] “recalled almost 13,000 of their vehicles…”From what I read, that’s basically every single car they manufactured…. So that’s a bit more notable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 05:05:57'] Rivian isn't even able to start meaningful production on these vehicles for another year at least, and they're not going to be up to speed for even longer. There's no way they can meet the deadline until they've actually finished building the entire plant.

There was a time when backlinks were the currency by which authority was generated, but since probably 2015, the Google spider has been able to make meaning out of text directly and rank it accordingly.OpenAI launched a UI to a natural language processing engine, much of which was built on the research Google has been doing for a decade and open sourcing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:07:38'] You should recognise that although Google represents itself as a technology company, by revenue, it's an advertising company. About 80% of its revenue. I can't find what percentage of that is from paid search, but I imagine it's quite large.The search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.Now go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.Google can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.So I think google is going to face serious headwinds in terms of their core revenue drivers. They will survive, but its going to be painful. They got complacent. The tortoise overtook the hare while he was resting on his laurels.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:58:39'] I owned amazon when it was $72 a share. I think I sold at $119 or so. thought I was pretty smart. thankfully I'm in now at $1200, but damn what a difference.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:47:44'] Finally my patience will be rewarded
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:49:46'] My 1 share is rewarded
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:10:49'] Google and Amazon doing this simultaneously makes me suspicious as to why they want to enter the Dow at the same time pretty much.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:09:27'] Buy buy buy!Then in a few days became a -10% bagholder just like GOOGL.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:49:41'] not too surprising. many people speculated that this would happen after google announced their split.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:58:46'] Is it better to buy now or wait until after the split?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:47:45'] Don't forget the stock buyback too. Big news.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:55:27'] SEC filing - [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001018724/000101872422000009/amzn-20220309.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001018724/000101872422000009/amzn-20220309.htm)&#x200B;These $10B repurchase replaces the previous $5B repurchase that was approved. Out of the previous $5B Amazon already repurchased $2.12B so this leaves $7.88B, unless I am wrong and it is brand new $10B.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:44:59'] What's the deal with fractional AMZN shares? Will the investor get the equivalent amount of shares after the split (e.g. youll get 10 shares if you have 0.5 of one already), or will they get paid out in cash?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:56:10'] Lmao, love it that the buyback seem less important than the stock split. Edit : 10b buyback isn't great either tbh thought lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:47:18'] Anything to get the stock moving. It has been trading like a bond for over a year now. The $10 billion buyback should be what drives the stock higher.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:27:03'] I think it's great they're finally doing a split but I find it quite peculiar that they're doing a buy back at the same time and that's definitely not a common occurrence afaik.    Can someone explain to me what the benefits of this are?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 19:16:12'] Soooo everyone who isn’t in is gonna buy post split right?Cause I am
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:54:30'] Hmmm 10 billion share repurchase is nothing if u compare to meta 50 billion. 3% of marketcap vs 10% of marketcap!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:04:29'] I literally started my position in it yesterday with half a share lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:03:14'] JFC market. Can you calm down. I juuust stretched myself thin enough to secure the 5 Google shares, no way Im getting enough Amazon before June 6Oh well, at least all 1 of my shares will get this nice bump
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:53:45'] Ohhh yes papi.  Jeff has had enough of this stagnation
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:53:54'] Ugh, was waiting for it to drop to $2500ish to open a position. All well, I'll just wait for a pullback.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 16:37:34'] I might finally be able to buy without it being a fractional share.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:45:01'] So no one is talking about the fact that the free float will be around 9 billion shares….
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:49:02'] My .35 shares are going to be 7 whole shares!  I'm rich I'm tellin' ya!  ( Seriously though, it does kind of make me feel better)

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:55:51'] Finally, I am waiting for Bezo to announce stock split since GOOGL’s announcement. Finally I am able to sell CC on them
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:59:23'] what can we expect from the $10 billion buyback?    In previous cases or in other companies, has the value gone up significantly?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:27:21'] I can finally get the whole share now lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:07:37'] IMO, I think Amazon's stock will have a tough year which sets up the stock buyback.They own around 18% of Rivian and recorded a $12 billion unrealized gain from Rivian which is how their earnings was so good for 4th Q. This was responsible for about 80% of Amazon's net income for their 4th Q but their operating profits fell by half. Their advertising and cloud business is booming but advertising is likely not yet profitable. Their retail business hasn't looked good lately with higher costs surging and unlikely to stop any time soon.With Rivian prices dropping from their recorded $103 price at Dec 31 to now $45, they are sitting at an $8.2 billion net loss that will have to be reported on their 1Q 2022 earnings. I'm curious to see how it will play out but the stock buyback is a scheduled buyback. The last time there was a stock purchase authorization was in 2016 for $5 billion. They only managed to purchase $2 billion worth of shares in that five year span with those buybacks actually only happening at the start of this year. This new $10 billion share buyback means they will only buy back about $8 billion but seeing as how they rarely even actually buyback their shares, it's possible they expect the stock price to go through some headwinds and want the opportunity to buyback. Seems like it was a great way for a temp stock boost for people to cash out but I would be wary going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:00:58'] They announce that after the doj is looking to investigate them ?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 17:45:17'] I just accepted an Amazon job offer that came with 17 RSUs. Love this news.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 19:49:54'] Stock splits mean nothing. You own the same % of the company before and after. Who cares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 09:09:36'] ...sooo are we going back to 3200-3400 range (160-170 adjusted) for another couple years?!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:05:05'] Entering new era of valuations pretty soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:36:43'] Oh, good to hear this.  Makes it easier for us retail investors.Of course, I just bought the last share I had intended to buy and was going to just hold from here onwards (me and my mighty 4 shares!).  Oh well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:42:14'] Daddy Jassy came thru. I believed. Position 3 shares @ 726
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:47:53'] So do you buy now or after the split?

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:16:07'] finally my one share will turn into 20!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:25:57'] I’m going to wait to buy. Seeing with what happened with GOOGL, I don’t want to be left bag holding for a few months, while I can invest into other things.As of this moment it looks to be around $150-$200 after the split? If so I’m definitely buying a good amount of shares, once things cool off a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:27:45'] Is this partly psychological?Would Joe Bloggs be more willing to buy a few whole split shares of Amazon rather than a fraction of one?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:40:34'] More slices of the same pizza
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:42:47'] Fuck I was literally going to buy a share earlier today
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:49:28'] So does this mean the $2,977 per share will be brought to $149? Because damn I’d be able to buy in
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:55:20'] What happened if you have Leap calls currently?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:59:17'] When's the split happening?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 17:43:39'] I guess competition against Google and Amazon is heating up, so they want more retail money in. If they won't split their competitors shares look more attractive in terms of price, especially when people can't buy Amazon or Google share because they are too expensive.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 17:44:01'] Literally sold a 2850 covered call today FML
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 18:11:48'] Jeff Bezos is going to have 1,296,471,400 Billion shares and Mackenzie Scott 298 Million shares of AMZN.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 19:47:17'] Google did that and crashed right after 😆
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 20:35:54'] Bezos isn’t the CEO anymore so the new guy split it I bet
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 21:08:48'] I dipped my little bitch toes in and bought a (yes, 1) share of AMZN and one GOOGL. Teacher, father of two under 2, single income earner.. fuck it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 21:31:30'] Damn, Now I can't watch my 4,000 for one contract go up in flames. It'll be 20 of them!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 00:31:41'] Newbie here.. Soooo… does this mean it’s a good time to buy?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 02:59:57'] So Amazon in June and Alphabet in July? Great news.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 04:37:39'] It’s a double edge sword because whoever has 100 shares at current price ($2500+) selling 1 covered call and a short call with commissions of $1 a leg, now has 10 short calls and $10 commissions a leg. The other side is retail can finally afford to sell calls against their shares at ($100+)
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 05:59:47'] Apparently Bezos is a former hedge fund manager as well as someone who used to create dark pools so you'd better believe he's in charge of the price of AMZN.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 07:54:42'] Serious question. What are the likely hood we see both Amazon and google back up to 2k per share post split in the next 20-30 years? This seems like big win
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 12:12:14'] I work at Amazon as a software dev and my output will hardly change Amazon Stock. So yeah Im bullish as hell for my RSUs lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 13:12:06'] When will the split take into effect?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 17:11:23'] Great way to juice your stock in the face of rampant inflation and a nice Rivian write down on the books.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-12 19:13:40'] I invested over 20 years ago and have been holding since then... So excited to see what happens with split. My buy price was around 16.75 per share. 😁
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 13:48:10'] Source?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:53:08'] Yes! The two big companies I’ve been buying lately both have 20:1 splits. That is fortunate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:44:29'] Silly question, but if I were to buy one stock today, would it be eligible for the split?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:11:49'] So I have one share that I paid $3350 for. I understand I will now have 20 shares, but how is it determined what the share price will be?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:37:34'] Holy fxck finally
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:37:52'] Saved up some thousands last year to put into Google and Amazon. These are my never sell stocks, so hopefully the low cost drives up the investing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:42:44'] Damn, it finally happened huh
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:59:40'] Sheesh, that after-hours spike!

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 16:39:15'] Does anyone know about when the split will happen?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:24:21'] I never understood how stock splits do anything for the price. Most people who invest in Amazon can buy multiple shares, how could cutting its price effect the amount of people interested in buying?

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:56:22'] When is the split
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 14:59:59'] They should have waited to announce this on Friday, would have helped to break the downtrend the market is in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 15:45:02'] Is this generally a good thing for the stock or bad?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 16:07:11'] Makes sense. Prices for Amazon crap from China is going to skyrocket cause shipping was already high and now with oil prices up not many people are going to wreck less shop as much. In other words revenue and profit will be down in the coming quarters. So announce a split, rally the stock, insider sell at a peak, and Amazon falls to a reasonable fair market value. Let me see these 2024 put costs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 16:07:17'] So buy before split or after?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 16:12:28'] I'm in around 3300. Almost capitulated.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 16:25:27'] When is this happening and what happens if you only have half a stock? Lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 16:26:15'] I’m not exactly sure it’s a good idea or not. Serious. No idea.The usual reason behind it is to get more retail investors(us).Some splits are good. But Apple hasn’t really moved since the split.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 19:29:14'] I predicted a split over the summer when it hit ATH. I bought right before the summer earnings without even realizing earnings was a week away and lost a lot. Then I cut my loses. I’m up FTY but it’s my biggest loser. I hate Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 23:48:11'] strange question, can anyone tell me if this affects fractional shares? Im trading through wealthsimple (canadian)
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 23:58:51'] The buy back feels like Day 2.Buying back is admitting that you aren’t able to invest the money in your business and be more profitable than your investors. That’s fine for a utilities provider who has a stable business but for a „growth“ company like Amazon it feels weird. My current take is that we are entering the Balmer period of Amazon, some sideways movement but can’t really see how anything exciting will happen. I’ll probably stay invested at current levels and see where that takes me but nothing more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 07:04:07'] will not save the company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 16:44:16'] Frankly I'm truly surprised by the comments here and how people completely miss the mark on Peloton. This Amazon deal is huge, it will increase shipping time, save on shipping costs and more importantly, utilize Amazons 3rd party network of home installers to set up bikes. Peloton's greatest cost driver was their "white glove" service. As far as the product being a fad? Everyone that uses the service, rants and raves about it, it generates over 1.5 billion dollars in revenue just from their subscriptions with a 90% retention rate. It's successful because it plays into a human condition, we often chose the path of least resistance. If waking up, joining an ONLINE class before work from the comfort of your own home gets you to work out. Then 44 dollars a month cost is cheap price to pay for your health. How much do you spend on going out to eat every month? My wife lost 12 lbs during the pandemic using her Peloton. I agree that the business model needs to be revamped, but to trash on the product without actually using it, that just being silly. Recently soul cycle launched a marketing campaign against Peloton and basically got laughed out of the room, then it turned into a viral meme. Something about turning in a Peloton for a years worth of Soul Cycle classes. The public said, thanks but no thanks, it totally backfired. They have a cult following.

Youve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when theres a threat of serious harm to the economy or to the financial system, and were prepared to use those tools, Powell said Wednesday during a news conference that followed the Feds decision to hike benchmark interest rates another quarter percentage point. And I think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe. Powell noted that deposit flows have stabilized over the past week following what he called powerful actions from the Fed to backstop the system.'

Of course, the dividends have purchased me a lot of "free" shares so it's not like I'm crying, but I bought AAPL at the same time, and I wish I would put everything into them.  I don't own losers because I refuse to gamble on any.  If I didn't buy CVX, MCD, AAPL, MSFT, V, etc., I'd just buy BRK.B, or SPY instead.  I have never really "lost" money in the market, and do not intend to.  Although, I've never once doubled my money in the short term like some people.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 19:01:12'] Mine are T (AT&T) and VZ (Verizon). - For T (AT&T): I bought at $19.76 (average cost basis for 100+ shares). The stock price is $18.61 right now, so that’s why it’s not too bad. The position is down -5.83% in my portfolio. - For VZ (Verizon): I bought at $50.09 (average cost basis for 100+ shares). The stock price is $37.66, so this one is worse. It’s down -24.82%- I sell covered calls on both of these while collecting dividends so it’s not too bad. I have a little more than 100 shares of each due to dividends getting reinvested at first. But I’ve turned off the DRIP for now, as I’d rather keep the cash and deploy elsewhere.- honorable mention: my MMM position is also down right now, but I love the dividends and hope to hold for a long time, as I do believe in the company long term

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 09:23:27'] Lot of misinformation on this thread but to be expected. The main one being the VIE structure - the CCP have reiterated that they support this structure as well as listing of their companies on foreign exchanges. Moreover many Chinese companies pay out dividends and buy back shares - clearly the companies themselves do not think the VIE is worthless. And let’s not go into other investors like Munger, Lu, Pabrai, Bury who all still hold significant Chinese positions. There is no such thing as zero risk but plenty has been priced in already into these Chinese stocks. I don’t own Baba but have positions in Tencent (240 HKD average) and Baidu (100 USD average) and have no intention of selling anytime soon.

POST_TEXT: b"Which of these disruptive platforms is a better long-term investment?\n\n\r  \nShopify (SHOP -6.01%) and Fiverr International (FVRR -1.39%) both challenge the status quo for selling goods and services. Shopify's e-commerce services enable smaller merchants to set up their own online stores, process payments, fulfill orders, and manage their marketing campaigns without joining a crowded online marketplace like Amazon. Meanwhile, Fiverr is a gig economy marketplace that hosts hundreds of categories of writing, coding, media, marketing, and design jobs.\r  \n\r  \nShopify and Fiverr both saw their stocks hit all-time highs during the buying frenzy in meme and growth stocks throughout 2021. But as of this writing, Shopify and Fiverr trade about 64% and 91%, respectively, below those frothy levels.\r  \n\r  \nBoth stocks lost their luster as investors fretted over their slowing growth in a post-pandemic market.

As I see it, as someone whose worked in ecommerce for 10 years,  Shopify have 3 types of customer1. Startup types dropshipping from their bedrooms. Shopify did very well out of this type of customer during the pandemic. My concern with this type is that 90% will fail and then cancel their shopify. The ones that are very successful may want to migrate to a different platform, as even Shopifys top tier plan isn't as cheap as some alternatives. 2. Small mom n pop companies who want an online presence. I believe many of these will discover that selling online is extremely expensive when you try marketing. So they'll either sell very little or will give up online entirely 3. Medium size or established small businesses. Many of these won't want to migrate to another platform to save $, but some will.  Shopifys continued success depends on these type of companies not wanting to switchSo, in summary,  my worry about shopify targeting small companies is that most of those companies will fail as they discover that the biggest impediment to selling online isn't having a nice looking store, but nstead huge marketing costs. Of the ones that are successful - how many will stay? The difficulty and cost in changing platform is perhaps Shopifys Moat
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 02:00:47'] SHOP is a little expensive right now, but a way better long-term investment than FVRR imo. I've used FVRR quite a bit in the past for simple design work, but I doubt I'll be doing that much anymore with AI getting so good. Plus FVRR is also overpriced imo. Their growth looks disgusting and unless that reaccelerates it's hard to justify the current valuation. Just way too many risks.

I don't think it's in the same category as fiverr though. That said, even with the AI advances, new gig jobs will be created for data labelling, and verifications. It'll be a while though because those bots love to hallucinate when trying to give you an answer (which many have yet to realize). That'll be a bigger problem than mis/dis-information.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 03:22:41'] I'd go with Shopify, most of the regulation that they have is already priced in. Fiverr will almost definitely get some new regulation to cover the tax evasion going on there which would likely depress their value.

I am a little more favorable (but not by much) of fiverr simply because services change over time but will never go away. But I question what their ceiling is. I do understand that segments will be impacted over time. Graphic design is already being hit. But this is another one of those things where its customer base is likely small businesses. Nothing wrong with that, but stability and long term outlook will probably be limited. I personally wont buy either.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 15:30:37'] india is very price sensitive market and 400+$ phones made only 3% of total smartphone market. Earlier apple didn't really take india seriously indian premium smartphone market was dominated by OnePlus. Plus iphones were produced in China and costed a heavy import duty. Few years ago apple started manufacturing in India and got to save on the import duty, this allowed them to be competitive at pricing, especially during sales. Plus average price of Android smartphones started going up. Fall of OnePlus and premium image of apple has allowed it to become most popular expensive phone and do record sales here. Hence apple has started taking india seriously due to the growth potential.

This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.\n\n* I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.\n\n* I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:03:30'] Just buy AVUV in addition to whatever you currently hold if you want to overweight smaller companies. The equal weight ETFs have higher expenses, you'd be better off holding a traditional S&P500 ETF + a targeted small cap fund.

IMO if hardware for machine learning gets cheaper all that will happen is big companies will buy more of it and use it to train models with more parameters, or train more models at once for hyperparameter selection.

For a long haul the return is about 12% higher than more volatile S&P on annualized basis. After discussed with several old timer money managers, I like DIA also,  Both RSP and DIA went up 2.15-2.27% today while SPY was up less +1.4%.  Its heavy weight fanng did not move up a lot.

One of the first things I ordered from Walmart. com this way was 12 bars of Sure Unscented Deodorant (very hard to find).  Within about 2 hours a random unmarked, older sketchy car pulls up to my house.  Old dude gets out and opens his trunk...my office is at the front of my house so I see everyone.  He opens the trunk and pulls out a single Walmart bag and it dawns on me its my delivery already.  Holy shit, that's impressive right?  So I go get the bag and realize....there is ONE FUCKING DEODORANT IN THERE!   I was like "wtf is going on?".   2 hours later another dude shows up and drops off 2 more....  FINALLY, the next day FedEX dropped off the final 9 from the Warehouse itself.  Finally realized the local store fulfills what they can and then the Warehouse does the rest.  I paid 1.97 per deodorant.  So literally the first and second guy most likely spent more in gas than the deodorant cost me.  Walmart needs to get a handle on how to do this if they are going to take the mantle from Amazon.  In the meantime, I will pay whoever offers me the cheapest rates.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 16:57:47'] I used the on-line purchase / curbside pickup for the first time (and last) months after it was introduced.  I waited 20 minutes for an order of a single item.  And there wasn't even a queue to park.  I just sat with all the other waiting customers staring as just a few employees slowly went back and forth from the store to the next waiting car.Wal-Mart simply doesn't have the employee staffing level/skills to pull something like this off.  I watched an order-picker once grab a loaf of bread off the shelf and tuck it (squeeze it) under her arm so she could grab the next item.    The staff aren't paid enough to care.  It's kind of simple as that.

The subs are better quality or bigger jars at the price you ordered. Once I ordered a small jar of peanut butter and they subbed a 48 oz jar.  They have 3 packs of cookies from the bakery.

I would have to hunt all over the place and find packages thrown in bushes or dumped in the middle of our driveway.  The website is tedious to use now and I have given up.  I now do my grocery shopping in person (It is quicker than drive up).  I would not waste my money on their stock at this time.  They are NOT Amazon.

Very cheap in terms of human labor for Walmart.   The process of picking up is far better for the consumer but is going to be very expensive for Walmart.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 09:13:50'] I ordered an ice-maker from Wal-Mart's website. Turns out it was actually sourced from some other small business called "Kayla's Cleaning Supplies" or something like that. It was a used ice machine, which was very obvious by the many layers of tape, unorganized contents, missing manual, and water resting in the machine. I tried to return it and Wal-Mart kept blowing me off. First call, take it to the local walmart customer service center with this label. They wouldnt accept it. Second call, they offered to send me a UPS shipping label to return it, never got it so on the third call I was told the same thing, we will send you a UPS shipping label. I told the guy on the phone that my 30 days was about to expire so would I still be able to return the item after 30 days if I still hadnt gotten my shipping label? He assured me it was ok. Guess what. Still got that fucking ice maker and Walmart did nothing. Liuterally gave me the run around until I couldnt do anything about it. Fuck ordering from Walmarts website. Fuck that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 13:11:20'] If Walmart wants to go toe to toe with Amazon their store needs a redesign.  The drive up business is great but they can’t have people stocking the shelf only to have another employee shop from the shelf.  Move the online business 100% back office automated for grocery with a stream lined pickup.  Sometimes the pickup is a 5 min wait and sometimes its 40.  Can’t have that.

Most of the climb had already taken place over the weeks. But, given that currently AI is the flavor of the month I'd be a little worried about adding more positions into GOOG. As a disclaimer, I have positions on GOOG since last year that I've been closing out and cashing in on my gains. I've linked my DCF, Revenue model and Cost model all at the bottom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# REVENUE:\n\n\r  \n***Cloud***\r  \n%Rev, Cloud is an area gaining massive traction due to how much convenience it adds, And the switching cost of cloud is massive, having to port over the entire database into competitors and retraining employees, so the loyalty of Cloud customers are strong. \r  \nSo, Id argue that Cloud starts becoming a big part of GOOGs identity.\r  \n\r  \nY/Y, Cloud grows at CAGR of 19% according to ([SOURCE](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/news/cloud-computing-market-size-is-"

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:27:30'] GOOG is my largest holding. I don't think it's accurate to call goog "reactive". They've been working on AI for a long time, they didn't just throw something together to compete with chatgpt.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 01:01:35'] The problem with Nvidia is the same problem you get in every single market: high volumes and high margins attract competition and investment. But worse, because you're in tech and you're only as good as your latest products. Companies very often get complacent when they are market leaders (see Oracle, IBM, Intel recently).AMD was never lured to fight much Nvidia on the peanuts of the gaming market, they never made any money on pc GPU, but this may change with AI. Intel too has recently started competing.Point is: what really matters to customers of those GPUs eventually is how much computing power they get for their money. There's different models and different software out there.Anybody expecting Nvidia to dominate without a competition for a decade clearly does not understand the complexity of long term dominance in tech which is very hard to obtain and maintain.

They have been bearish in actions and statements the last month or so as well.  But not sure anyone has even talked about that.  Why do you think Amazon had and early Prime day out of nowhere?  Tea leaves are there for anyone who is listening.  META is future focused and rolling our new products which are being received poorly.  Google has been silent. May be ok.  As had apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 13:30:14'] **General macro comments**:Atlanta GDPNow still at 3.2% for Q1 2023 real quarterly annualized growth, unchanged from yesterday. Next update is Friday, March 24th.Also, apparently the housing starts was way bigger than expected. I'll just add that it seems that particular statistic is extremely noisy. > Privately-owned housing starts in February 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,450,000. This is 9.8 percent (+/- 15.5%)* above the revised January 2023 estimate of 1,321,000That is a 90% confidence interval of [-5.7, 25.3], or statistically indistinguishable from 0.If you look at the other indicators reported by the [Census Bureau Index of Economic Activity](https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/), housing start estimates have much larger confidence intervals / high uncertainty compared to the other ones.---**Useless comments on my portfolio + BTU Update**:What a great day for my big tech holdings. AMD up 7.7%, GOOG up 4.7%, MSFT up 4%, SMH up 4%, META up 3.6%. I will soon be using these opportunities to trim (slightly) MSFT/AAPL/AMD as they are too big of an individual position. I'll move the cash into my small cap value ETFs, or from AMD to SMH.Meanwhile, on the commodity side, yesterday I had went pretty hard on BTU/AMR/XOM/PSCE. Today I added to CF (fertilizer). Some exciting news on BTU is that Investor Relations told some folks that they are working hard to get the surety bond covenants taken care of before March 31st, and at the worst, a little bit into April. A blackout period will start pretty soon (between quarter end and the next earnings report), so they might not get time to start capital returns. But at least an announcement about it will soon occur. Follow @8750Capital and @tradedollarnut on Twitter for more news (you won't find it anywhere else).AMR remains highly undervalued if you want an entry point. It tends to zoom up to $170 then come right back down. Eventually, the math of high met coal prices and buying out 30% of your float will win.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 08:07:06'] With all the discussion about hard landing, soft landing, no landing, and the fixation on a potential banking liquidity crises, take a look at what has happened in the past in similar circumstances.The banking sector will be backstopped by the fed. A crises of confidence would be unacceptable. It is my opinion that this will blow over in a month or two.As far as a “landing”. Rate hikes are not necessary bad for stocks. A large factor in stock valuations going higher will be if the fed can thread the needle.  They are hiking into a growing economy where borrowing and lending flow freely. The economy is expanding at a level that even to this day is exceeding the rate hikes.If the fed funds rate can restrict enough to take care of the inflation picture while allowing conditions for expansion - watch out above, new ATH in the equity indices will come faster than many thought possible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 06:20:41'] Don’t lose sight of enemy #1: inflation. It is currently still running like a wild animal at 3x the feds target level.  The fed will keep QT until inflation is down below 2.5%. The risk of letting inflation becoming entrenched is too great for the longer term health of the US economy.I’m in the 25 and pause camp. I think the surprise that a lot of folks will have to comes to terms with is how long the pause is going to be. As inflation trends lower, I believe the fed funds rate will be kept above core inflation for longer than folks think. The value of equities over the next 6-12 months is not a concern to the fed. They will need to follow through and tamp down growth in order for all of us to enjoy a sustainable restart to the economic cycle.

So shorting the 2 year bond could be a play here. The failed/failing banks were mismanaged and don't represent the overall financial sector. Tempted to go long well-managed companies. To me that means the stocks Buffett holds: BAC, AXP, Ally. Of those I like AXP the most.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 16:58:14'] To those saying these loans to banks from the Fed don't actually expand the money supply because they are "temporary" 1 year loans.  Look at the purchases by the Fed during QE4.https://i.imgur.com/X7tL4S0.pngAs you can see, vast majority are not 30Y but 7.5 yrs or less (75%).  And 56% are 4.5 years or less.  And these all mature eventually so technically all of this is "temporary", but that doesn't mean it isn't adding money to the system.It also appears to me that these loans add to bank reserves at the Fed which are earning extremely generous rates of 4.65% (which btw is causing Fed to operate massively in the red for the first time in history).  Therefore these loans seem to be essentially free.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 16:41:57'] Could someone please explain the second paragraph about delta hedging in simple terms:> Some might wonder why a banking crisis is hitting oil so hard, as it is unlikely to impact crude demand and production. But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.So financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.The firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works? (What would be the price of the sale? Would it be higher or lower than the current market price? Who gets the right to buy/sell?)

Here's Fitch's reason which is similar, also citing insured deposits.>Fitch views FRC's deposit base as concentrated given the strategic focus on banking wealthy and financially sophisticated customers in select urban coastal markets in the U.S. This not only drives a high proportion of uninsured deposits as a percentage of total depositsThat all said, it seems Chuck's SCHW empire is growing steadily in popularity around here.

POST_TEXT: b'Amazon .com said it was buying medical care company, One Medical, pushing deeper into the healthcare game. The company is being acquired in an all-cash transaction for roughly $3.9 billion, including debt. One Medical, owned by San Francisco-based 1Life Healthcare, offers concierge-based medical services.\n\nOne Medical adds to Amazons (ticker: AMZN) portfolio of healthcare services. The online retailer introduced Amazon Care in late 2019, which offered access to urgent and primary care services and targeted the employer market. Soon after that service was launched, it acquired Health Navigator, an online symptom-checking tool.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/amazon-healthcare-one-medical-51658410615?mod=search\\_headline](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/amazon-healthcare-one-medical-51658410615?mod=search_headline)'

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 18:05:18'] I don't see what they are paying $4 billion for. I've used One Medical several times and it's literally just a normal doctor's office with an "upscale" lobby/waiting room. The doctors were all very young and not super experienced. The only added value is they have a nice app, and are usually in central locations in most major cities. Is that really worth billions? Not seeing what the angle is here.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 07:48:46'] Smart move for them imo. Lot of money in health care.

If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you\'re looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they\'re giving you a dividend, its such a bonus.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 00:22:00'] Realistically stock picking, especially a mid-somewhat large cap isn’t easy, heck even for large/mega caps. Just quickly looking at this stock though there’s a couple things I **personally** don’t like… it lacks volume, average volume seems to be about 300k, it’s a South Korean company, long term chart looks ehh. The P/E can be “great”, earnings, financial statements, PRs, etc and the stock might not move how you would expect it, I do believe being a *by the book* trader/investor is great, but it has been a bit out of touch these last several years. Social media and social perception is a huge thing these days. I do think fundamentals will come back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:20:48'] How much do you have invested? Under $1m? Yes do the concentrated portfolio with 4-6 stocks. Companies you can stay on top of. A more diversified portfolio or etf portfolio you sacrifice substantial gains. Of course exposure to risk is much greater but this is how big money is made.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:04:55'] If you’re interested in learning about investing, I would say start by listening to as many diverse approaches as you can, and see what makes sense, what ideas seem to repeat across different approaches, what types of assets people use, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:06:27'] This guy is a billionaire. When you have billions of dollars you can afford to "just keep buying stocks you like when they're down" indefinitely.It seems like a terrible example to be basing any conclusions about anything on.There is absolutely nothing conservative about his situation. I'm no stock wizard but conservative is usually investing in stuff like ETFs where someone more experienced sells bundles of stuff packaged together. Picking individual stocks with no real experience it's just another form of gambling. Even the most conservative form of picking solo stocks from gut intuition is still very volatile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 01:42:18'] Conservative? Then I *think* the most important variable is moat. Which is hard to put a number to. But you can kinda tell who's got it, who don't, and who *really* got it.

For every $1 of revenue, $PLUG spend >$1 while Amazon basically gets free stuff from those $PLUG deals.The only way that $PLUG stay afloat is either issuing more shares or raising capital from bonds which is pretty expensive now. Both mean $PLUG shareholders will be fucked.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-21 20:36:32'] Unless this is universal, the effect will be minimal.  The company is too massive to have small pockets cramp the bigger picture.  This would have to be a high percentage and for a decent length of time to really push the needle.  Sadly, without union protection, this may mean that many find themselves out of work and hurting themselves more than Amazon.

As far as the numbers go it will not affect sales, shipping times will briefly increase, and reduced labor for a day. As far as the share price goes this is pretty much irrelevant.

Maybe ten years down the line when automation improves margins and there investments in logistics infrastructure pans out but right now feels like a money sink with the bright side being amazon ads.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 09:17:23'] I have worked in Amazon for almost 3 years in an almost senior level. If they find something wrong like this for example.. their solution is to automate it and avoid human interference with into it. Although it sounds very tough to automate things, Amazon is a cash cow that can pump heavily into RnD to get rid of these kind of problems. They might be already working on it... Infact, the current lobbying they are doing itself is considered as an unnecessary spending According to them. Also they hire season/contract workers (more than required man power) so that they can avoid these kind of issues from effecting sales.

Decided to quit because my team kept getting assigned to do stuff we were not hired to do originally without any extra pay or even a compensation. They always said it was because of covid related personel restrictions that we had to do the work of 3 other teams. We had 6 different "managers" in less than a year and in the introduction meeting for the last one 2 girls were actually crying on camera because of the insane work load. This was in Costa Rica. I was let go after 9 years of work and dedication and it really hurt how dismissive the whole process was. We have become too easy to replace and the company to big to care.I have 0 intentions of buying anything from Amazon or help the company anymore in any way.

What the fuck does a one day strike accomplish. Nothing. That’s what. They should’ve been prepared to strike from thanksgiving to Christmas until their demands were met. This isn’t gonna do jack shit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 05:10:52'] So buy gifts now??? Right?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 05:18:57'] In the meantime apply elsewhere, you can easily get multiple times what Amazon will ever offer you to come back and likely they will fire all of them within 6 months anyway. They don't want employees that know how to manipulate their system and everyone is expendable or will be within 3-6 months. Not to mention their automation implementation is quickly replacing workers...I've seen this happen enough times to know how it'll play out.As far as stocks? This will only go up, there is no shortage of demand and no replacement even close...
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 05:46:57'] Amazing. Kudos to all of them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 06:06:30'] I bought all my gifts early and at physical stores to relieve the pressure of Amazon purchases. It's not much, but i feel like it's faster and  better experience imo
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 07:19:40'] I think these types of events are more significant than many investors are factoring in (not just for Amazon) and they are a sign of the leverage that "employees" have over their employers right now.  The labor shortage is real, and wages will continue to rise.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-22 07:46:12'] Why black Friday? Want to make a dent, Cyber Monday is when you should strike.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 15:08:35']  The law of supply and demand rules. If you can find a better job out there that pays more money then quit Amazon and to to the other job and there are a lot of jobs out there so,  If you can't find a better job then shut up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 03:37:20'] I think content creation is really there to add value to their products. Netflix has 31.6bn revenue and Apple has 394.3bn revenue.Chasing the competitive streaming dollars is such a poor use of cash. But driving more product sales and bringing people into the Apple ecosystem is far more profitable.Netflix would rather sell $1000 devices every 2 years than collecting $7 per month that can be shared by multiple people and cancelled anytime.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 02:59:19'] Plenty of people out there that need jobs after all the recent layoffs.

If Apple would just pour 2-3 billions into this sector and set some initiatives more companies would build for Mac. Id never look back at Windows again. I already do all my coding/designing etc on Mac but always since years have to buy a Windows gaming machine. Same with all my colleagues at work. Then all the hassle with wiring up 2 systems etc. ughhhh such a missed opportunity by Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 06:25:42'] I actually got Apple TV recently and it’s actually pretty good I think this maybe does it a bit of a disservice highlighting Ted Lasso as the only commercial success. Whilst not incorrect, there are actually some pretty good shows on there that just haven’t caught on yet. You’ve got Serverance, Shantaram and Foundation to name a few. For £7 a month and the first 3 months free it’s a bargain if you ask me

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 10:21:46'] Whats funny is 1 billion dollars is nothing to a company like Apple. Thats like pocket change for them. If they can invest this successfully and grow their Apple TV subscription base this can be a massive win for them. I heard they got some good content on there too but I think the main issue is there is not a lot compared to other streaming platforms. This could help fix that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 05:43:01'] This is the way. All steaming platforms should adopt this model, just makes sense. Have your big movies get a huge pop in theaters, let word of mouth spread the hype to the losers who think they are too cool to go see a movie in theaters and you will gain users organically. Apple TV has a small, but GREAT library of original content. They just need to general public to discover it

I wish him the best.Edit: Following up on request. It appears half the team (20 odd people) have early meetings scheduled at intervals and the other half the same meeting time late morning. All virtual since they are full remote. Early meetings are getting canned meetings so far. Effective immediately, yes to severance, and equipment to be returned by mail. Team lead didn't know until an hour before meetings started. My friend is in the later group meeting time which he presumes are the leftovers being kept on.Can't say I'm surprised as from what I've heard he does maybe a few hours of actual work and the rest of the day just passing time logged in.

Bottom line: Its profit declined 27% to $13.9 billion compared to 2021.  The need to trim the fat off and making it more efficient.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 04:29:44'] Their buyback program might finally start to meaningfully reduce shares outstanding now. It's crazy how despite being a mature biz with unbelievable margins, moat ect how little cash they've been able to return to shareholders. They need to take a leaf from Apple's book on being investor friendly, when growth slows you gotta tighten the belt. Even Sundar low key acknowledged that there was a culture of being 'rested and vested'.Bullish news for the company IMO
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 02:56:54'] Bullish long term for the company. Trim the fat gained throughout covid.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 04:26:35'] It’s always disappointing to see companies use this type of cycle to shed excess. Everyone decides it’s now safe to make cuts because everyone else is doing it and there’s less of a PR problem behind it. In the end it adds fuel to why there is zero trust with employers. Want to know why people quiet quit and job hop? This is why. As an investor I would put my money on a company that invests in people and feels a commitment to them, it will pay dividends when the music stops.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 10:45:18'] Amazon will certainly need another round with at least  10% layoffs for sure. Amazon is barely profitable and they only cut 3% after a huge hiring spree since mid 2020 and revenue growth has slowed to single digits. Google, Microsoft, meta are all more profitable and laid off more than Amazon in terms of %.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 15:51:32'] Regardless layoffs are happening it’s how they treat those laid off. Like Microsoft has a 60 day continued work then 6 months severance and job finding programs and healthcare. It also works in favor because it’s massive write offs in the books but they are treating employees with respect.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 16:31:59'] Hopefully this can trigger even more home price reductions
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 17:07:34'] If he takes full responsibility then he should return all comp paid to him since he’s been CEO and all that money should go as severance to people paid off. In fact this should be done to all execs since they are all responsible for it. They have one job as managers. Take care of people working under them and have the company on the path of sustained profitable growth. Since they have failed, return all monetary benefits and quit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 19:02:09'] Is there any data breaking down who and where the layoffs are?  These are gigantic, international companies, and they are laying off a relatively small percent of the company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 20:28:19'] Is there a breakdown of who is getting laid off? Support staff in the cafeteria vs. engineers and executives; just curious.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 03:43:06'] I think it’s crazy 12,000 jobs make up 6 percent of the work force
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 03:50:20'] What’s worse is these poor folks aren’t even given options to find alternative roles. You’d think talented googlers could fit into a variety of other roles but no, the street demands blood.

I’ve read too many posts on Reddit of tech workers getting $200K+ total comp. and only working 10-20 hours a week. That’s ridiculous…My friend who is in data analytics at google (very smart guy) hardly had to work in 2021. 2022 has been a different story, but still. It’s crazy how these gigantic tech companies dish out money for very little return.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 05:26:40'] Honestly this makes me wanna buy the stock more.cbiggest drawback at this valuation was way too much stock based compensation and way too many employees especially in the cloud segment

I took it like a personal insult, moved back to India and just recovered with my parents for three months. I empathise with everyone here. Just realise, Google is  just a company like Wriggley's chewing gum or your Nike shoes. Oh sure, it runs search and has a 400 billion dollar market cap but let me tell you, there are stupid people in there too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 04:31:30'] Good, Google clearly has a lot of fat that needs trimming.  For the number of employees they have, they really don't seem to innovate much.  Or even maintain what they already have - see Stadia.  I guess Pichai's direction to "be 20% more efficient" didn't work out. Anyway, I'm sure this is just the first wave.  There will be another round later.

They could easily keep more people employed if they didn't insist on paying in the Top 10% of salaries for the sector. I have several good friends who work for Google, and the amount of money they make for what they do is just insane to me...

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 04:04:03'] I’m very sorry for these individuals, but tech hiring/compensation/spending has been far too high for far too long.

They make most of their money by exploiting licenses (FIFA, NFL, Star Wars, etc.) to suck money out of a relatively small base of P2W whales.

POST_TEXT: b"  \nIonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  \nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities.

In other words, they will either freeze future investment and growth in any warehouses that unionize or straight up shut them down. I think the news is net negative for Amazon stock, but wont have as big of an effect as the media would like to tell it. Maybe $100M/year costs and losses for unionization, loss of warehouses, loss of productivity, and expenses to counteract unionization.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 16:36:51'] If it helps the turnover I would imagine it would help their labor costs instead of hurt.Turnover is excessively costly for businesses, especially at scale. I remember being a manager at Walmart around 6 years ago when they made huge efforts in increasing pay and employee on job training to lower turnover and it worked and they wound up saving money on labor despite having higher wages. Executives at this big companies can be very short sighted and stupid. Unions aren't that big of a deal, last I checked UPS is more profitable than FedEx but UPS has a union and FedEx doesn't. Treating your workforce with respect and paying a decent wage goes a long way towards morale and employee engagement. If you treat them like shit they'll give you much less effort and that will effect the company's bottom line.

Stores that had operated profitably for decades were suddenly deemed "unprofitable" & promptly closed. Spoiler alert: profits were above analyst’s expectations. CEO compensation? 909 times more than the median worker. Median employee compensation at Kroger actually dropped 8% to $24,617. (It really gets depressing once you factor in inflation!)Will Amazon actually close warehouses, as a "warning" to other fulfillment centers? We'll see. I wonder if any Amazon executives, upon retaining the services of the Pinkertons(!) in their anti-union efforts, gave voice to just how far they would be willing to go. Fortunately, the Pinkertons can't adopt the [violent methods of the past.](https://newrepublic.com/article/147619/pinkertons-still-never-sleep)
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-03 05:45:29'] Actual impact on the company is likely to be minimal. They're a drop in the bucket and the combined number of votes against unionization and those who didn't vote is almost double those that voted in favor. They don't have the leverage for major gains as they represent 0.63% of Amazon's US workforce by winning that location and they do not have massive employee support. I expect rerouting around them during any strike combined with member disappointment in the outcome of negotiations to seriously hinder future efforts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 15:11:22'] It is a huge win for the union and the organizers. The media is, in fact, correct. Of course, Amazon will do everything legal and illegal to stop this union.

If the unions get in the way of that it may be that in certain states in which their union contracts prevent automation they contract distribution and shut down their own centers. If the unions allow for automation I don’t think it affects Amazon in the long run much.

I think each Amazon warehouse must cost 100 million with construction cost.So one unionizes, you shut it down? What happens if 2 more follow in a month? It could get expensive fast trying to keep ahead of this.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 18:23:48'] Doesn’t mean anything to Amazon. They’re likely going to outsource the work being done there to other warehouses or automate. Bottom line is there is always another trick
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 21:41:46'] The unions have literally ruined our country. If you don’t like your job or pay, go get another one , otherwise shut the Hell up and be a good employee
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 21:31:35'] Terrible news for Amazon customers and shareholders, who will want Amazon to crack down on this as hard as Walmart does on its own unionization problems. Likely not great news for the workers either as there is simply not much margin to squeeze from Amazon's ecommerce operations and the union fat cats will want their dues.

This would seem to me affect more established companies, i.e., S&P 500 companies, than most tech stocks.

Fortunately I bought back in the next year and beyond (albeit at a higher price). I will never panic sell like that again.It's demoralizing watching your account in deep red (I am off about 10% from ATH). It can get worse so brace yourselves but stay the course if your own plans and/or stocks' fundamentals have not changed. This game requires a significant amount of patience and emotional restraint. I know that many of you probably FOMO'd in the last year on some risky bets that are now tanking. My guess is that this rotation will continue out of tech and growth for the next few months so expect more pain. The bright side is, consumer demand remains strong and inflation should subside. Fed will raise rates but they can cut them at any time. It is not a permanent solution like the media portrays it to be.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 16:33:47'] This has to be the biggest flash crash in history of stock market. Even March 2020 had rebounds, this has been a continuous drop since 6 weeks. Never seen that happened before. Fed actually hasnt even done anything yet. Thats the scary part.I think we are heading to 2019 levels. Which means Nasdaq 9k and SPY $250

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11/\n\nSix Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) workers were confirmed dead on Saturday after a series of tornadoes roared through a warehouse near St. Louis, ripping off its roof and causing 11-inch thick concrete walls longer than football fields to collapse on themselves. At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. Tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles. The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.\n\nWitnesses '

At the end of the article it also says there is a reward system that is powered by Mastercard.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 06:04:33'] Eh, I still like V long term. Visa is still the dominant credit card and I'm pretty sure it's the most widely accepted, with MC close second.  I don't buy that non-traditional payment companies will ever usurp them. People pay for shit with credit cards and I don't see any major US banking institution moving away from V + MC in their credit card offerings.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 05:42:22'] **Mastercard has the same fees in the UK as Visa does**, raised even before Visa did it. So, either Amazon wants to set an example or there is a strategic move (compensating for rising inflation/supply chain costs) in play there. Have the feeling this will be fought in court, while customers can continue paying with Visa. If Amazon doesn't apply this rule equally on all payment contractors, there is good leverage for Visa in court.below some additional tidbits from other news reports, which go more into detail..."Amazon is blocking UK credit cards from Visa as part of an ongoing battle over “interchange” fees — levies charged by card issuers to a merchant’s bank for each transaction. Visa’s interchange fees for transactions between the UK and the European Union (where Amazon UK processes payments) were previously capped at 0.3 percent by EU law. But since the UK left the EU, Visa has been able to hike that fee to 1.5 percent.However, Visa isn’t the only company to make such a change. MasterCard made an identical increase to its interchange fees before Visa, but it hasn’t been blocked by Amazon. It’s not entirely clear why Visa has been singled out. It may simply be a strategic decision on Amazon’s part — to hurt one company instead of taking on an entire industry. Or there may be specific complications in Visa’s payment policies. For example, Bloomberg notes that the company has increased interchange fees for e-commerce sites, while reducing fees in other areas, like education and real estate purchases. It’s not clear if policies from MasterCard or other card issuers make similar distinctions."https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 08:04:12'] It is an overreaction, in my opinion. Visa has almost the same fees as MasterCard but somehow the ban is to be placed on V only. Moreover, this change will not affect debit cards, in Europe credit cards are rarely used. I might be wrong, of course, but I believe this is an opportunity. I will buy the dip and hold for the next couple of years. Even with such harsh restrictions (from just one merchant) , I don't see it as a possibility that Visa will suffer for very long.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 09:21:21'] I’m going to buy as much items I can on Amazon with my Visa card so they are forced to pay the high fees!

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 12:53:46'] So if Amazon are now in bed with Paypal can’t us Brits just use with Paypal and have our Visa Credit card as the card sat behind the Paypal app?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 05:09:51'] This is a fairly significant move and I'm assuming other retailers will follow if accepting Visa cards just isn't worth it. 2022 outlook will most likely be poor. I have a position in Visa and will be taking a loss on it today.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 06:52:34'] I was under impression that Amex charges the highest fees (irrespective of the country). That's why few merchants don't accept it. Not sure about UK but in Canada, Amazon accepts Amex. So fees varies by region I guess!

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 08:37:09'] About a third of all UK credit cards are Visa badged. So significant though Visa has a lot higher market share of debit cards in the UK around 80%+ .

If Amazon couldn't negotiate a favourable deal with Visa re transaction fees, then good luck to all the other merchants....

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 08:37:12'] Yep Visa is being greedy as fuck, raising the fees. It's hilarious that their fees are now more than Amex who are known for high fees. Can see them changing course in the future since a lot of banks are going mastercard

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 07:18:27'] Isn't this why most companies and small businesses prefer their customers using debit cards or cash because credit card transactions fees are high?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 07:40:27'] I think something important to note about why Mastercard isn't affected is that when you go to basically any Amazon page in the UK you'll see this:> Pay ~~£39.99~~ £0.00: get a £40 Amazon Gift Card on approval for the Amazon Classic Mastercard. Terms apply.Amazon have a partnership with Mastercard to offer credit cards.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 07:33:32'] Certain Virtual type currencies with low fees and no chargebacks would solve this issue. Not the biggest ones which have transaction fees ranging from $50-$200 per transaction, there are some that scale on chain and will always have sub penny fees, due to their larger blocks that scale with tech advances.Visa/Mastercard/AMEX/Western-Union will face stiff competition in from these types of products.

Would seem weird to potentially lose sales because you don't accept one of the most common forms of payment on the planet.  Not everyone has multiple types of credit cardsI know for myself I only got a MasterCard to use at Costco.  If I wasn't a Costco shopper I would only have Visa cards.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 07:52:09'] This is really not a big deal. I would like to know the percentage of Visa’s total revenue that comes from the UK.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-17 07:54:07'] Note that it’s just the credit cards, not debit cards. I’m not sure how many people will be actually affected by this, but surely a very small portion. I think it’s just about flexing muscles to see who is the biggest bully.

Although high but for Amazon which charges in upwards of 10% that is not a huge cut in their gross margin/revenue, also keep accepting Debit makes no sense for higher cost, partnership and offers from other brand can be the only reason behind this move.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 07:13:01'] They fall 10 percent all the time or more.  It’s not a sure bet.  The spy is a pretty good bet for buy and hold.  Even it drops historically it always rebounds. Can’t say that for individual stocks. It’s always possible for apple and amzn to go out of business.  For spy to go to zero 500 the top 500 companies would have to go to zero.  Plus you collect a dividend of 1 percent a year on spy.  I’m not sure of the amount

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 07:56:39'] I have 1.5 Million worth of stocks but we’ll diversified although i admit i’m tech heavy  my biggest holdings are Tesla, FAANG, NVDA, NiO , some biotechs,, energy ,renewables, semiconductors, cybersecurity, cloud, 5G, Materials, industrials, REIT, ETF’s, financials , e-commerce , cryptos, couple of Chinese stocks. .. ,
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:17:45'] No one says you have to put a good chunk of your portfolio into index funds, in fact I would argue that bonds are a better investment than “VTI & Chill”. However, it’s risky to keep 100% of your portfolio in retail tech. Any slow down in either can lead to a broader crash in his portfolio and loss of capital. Just my two cents, investing also comes down to personal preference
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:19:28'] A huge portion apple's phone sales and mobile gaming revenue comes from china so I'd at least keep a close eye on the news to see if politics will end up being a problem. Otherwise they still have plenty of growth left in India and sea regions so they can still rely on their phones for a decent amount of time before they have to do something new. &#x200B;amazon at least in the short term is harder to justify because of how slow aws is growing combined with their ecommerce segment being hit hard by supply chain issues and generally already being barely profitable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:23:29'] You could look at the beta of the overall portfolio
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:32:39'] Anything can happen (Enron) however, for the next decade these companies are probably ok and I wouldn't be surprise if they beat the market by a significant margin.One would need to be up to date on all news, It wouldn't be a portfolio where you can just forget about it and never check it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:32:47'] I like his strategy. A “safe-risk” is how I like to think about it. Short term upside might be there and if that fails then long term you are safe with the stocks as long as you didn’t chase ATH and DCA if we see the stocks keep creeping down. I’m all AMZN and TLRY atm.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:35:44'] It depends; Apple will probably be around for the next while due to having a pretty dedicated market and being in near-complete control (at least now) of their side of the market. Amazon provides a pretty good service in buying and fulfilment (they own the "last mile" from warehouse to customer house, whereas Wal-Mart and Target still rely on UPS/USPS for even basic things like a phone charger). There is competition in those areas, but it's still a few years off from encapsulating what both companies can do.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:17:02'] I recently restructured to 60% amazon, 20% google, 10% spy, 10% rocket lab. Feeling pretty good about it
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:20:31'] They're not going to go to zero, if that's what you think he's risking. But OTOH he's not going to make a lot of neckbreaking new gains on them in the post-pandemic period.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:25:45'] It's a bit of risk for sure, but not insanely risky imo. These are both good companies trading at fairly reasonable valuations and both are extremely unlikely to go to zero. The risks start mounting when one or more of those things are not true.He'll likely see more volatility holding just two stocks, but he'll also have a much higher upside potential. I mean if he's been holding these two for the last decade your brother is looking pretty smart right now...What might be sensible is to take 10k out and put it in an all-world fund, but I guess that depends on risk tolerance. I'm not a huge fan of diversifying for the sake of diversifying. If he's happy with the risk/reward of this portfolio then it's a good portfolio for him regardless of what the index funder holders here will tell you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 09:54:45'] AMZN could go bankrupt
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 10:08:38'] The thing with apple is that too many people just think about the products they come out with, P/E ratio, etc etc for the valuation. However the reason to be bullish about Apple is that the oracle of Omaha mentioned about the management of Apple is well run. They’re sitting in loads of cash. I feel he’s safe. How old is your brother though? What’s his investment horizon? What’s his exit strategy? Everything is a risk of you don’t have an exit strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 10:14:27'] Individual stocks and short timeframes are risky for passive (buy and forget it) investing. Either decide to actively manage it or have a longer timeframe and more diversification.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 10:25:57'] Lol this is literally against any decent advice from experienced investors. All of them would tell you to diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 12:41:40'] he could sell options on the stocks to boost his returns if he really intends on keeping just those stocks and no diversification. not bad companies to pick if youre going to go all in on one basket
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 14:12:30'] > is he really risking anything?yes. Let's say tomorrow it comes out that Amazon is shipping children to the plant where they melt kids into iphones? Value of both would plummet, except to like about .002% of the population and nobody wants to be friends with them. Plus, I mean... depending on how much he has of each, I would not be shocked if he had 80k just a short time ago, which is a much bigger drop than the market at large.I am overweight on Apple probably, but I mean like a bit. I wouldn't put 50% of my portfolio in any stock. That is gambling.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 19:30:05'] Kind of a crappy time to be in those two stocks as they are heavily reliant on strong consumer spending.

Read this explanation first:**\n\n>ARM licenses its [ISA](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets) and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.  \nApple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.  \nYes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.  \nStock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 15:51:17'] The problem is that most of the companies that are available to buy now are good at different things than what will be most important after legalization.Legalization will likely result in lots of new entrants, followed by consolidation, and that's not necessarily good for most investors, even in the context of a growth market.I'd wait until the initial boom/bust is over and there are financial statements to look at.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 16:18:40'] This is mainly because Amazon’s high turnover policy burned through so many people… they literally can not staff some places even with the better pay and wages then say a McDonald’s or a Walmart because people just *love* weed that much.I’d gladly lose 2 or 3 bucks an hour off my paycheck for it.

They are struggling to keep employees and had such an anti-marijuana stance when I worked there a year ago and now that they need workers so bad (and also they'd make a shit ton of money from it being legalized since public support is high enough that they can actually make the $$) they're all for it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 17:41:13'] I kept buying the falling knife and it’s starting to look much better now. The amount of ppl calling me an idiot on here was ridiculous. I have a few friends in marketing at a Fortune 500 company and they said ads on FB/Insta are unmatched in their hit rate. They were expanding their ad budget this year and it was all going to FB. They made it sound like Tik Tok was still light years away - and they love using TikTok on their personal time lolThe only negative I’ll say is I kept buying it so much, it became close to 15% of my entire portfolio. And I’m sure that was risky. But I just couldn’t believe how much it kept falling. I bought a bunch in the $90-$100 range and wish I got more. I needed this earnings lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 16:58:39'] I am not a shareholder of Meta so I am going to try to look at this quarter as objective as possible without looking at the stock in the after hours (which seems to be the focus of Reddit currently)Revenue: Not good2021: 33.7 billion2022: 32.2 billion (-4%)Income from Operations: Really not good2021: 12.6 billion2022: 6.4 billion (-49%)Operating Margins: Not good2021: 37%2022: 20% (-46%)Net Income: Really not good2021: 10.3 billion2022: 4.6 billion (-55%)Lets look at their business segments 1. Family of Apps:Revenue:2021: 32.8 billion2022: 31.4 billion (-4%)Net Income:2021: 15.9 billion2022: 10.7 billion (-33%)2. Reality Labs ( this is the one of they are supposed to be growing and are sinking a ton of money into)Revenue:2021: 877 million2022: 727 million (-17%)Net income:2021: -3.3 billion2022: -4.3 billion (-23%)The losses from their Reality segments has really accelerated and they currently spent around 9 billion dollars of Capex compared to last years quarter which was around 5.4 billion.Overall looking at the fundamentals its still pretty ugly. The balance sheet also got a bit uglier from their current assets taking a big dip due to the cash they’re burning on this Reality Labs investment. Both current liabilities and total liabilities took a sizable increase. The good news is that they can afford these hits due to the balance sheet being clean. The stock is still down over 50% from its highs even after this after hours jump. My guess is that either the stock has already so much bad news priced into it that people just really don’t care about these losses. Most likely its the 40 billion stock buyback that causing the stock to balloon after hours which is a buyback that will eliminate 10% of their total shares. There could have also been guidance that I did not see as I did not listen to the earnings call.Overall very ugly quarter from a fundamental standpoint. Not interested in the stock and especially not interested after the after hours move lol. Just going to continue to stay away and continue to let Zuckerberg bleed money on these ridiculous goggles that nobody is buying.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 14:12:34'] I thought that earnings sucked. But Zuck's theme about improved efficiency and reducing CapEx by $4B and overall expense by $7B or so is making Wall Street bullish on Meta. But that cash burn on Reality Labs is still crazy. Is it because they are selling hardware at a loss or R&D into future products. When that goes down, the stock will truly be back. Until then this is a temporary boost for bag holders to exit :-) I might exit my position if this sustains tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 03:49:37'] BTW about Meta/Facebook. Buybacks make sense when a company is cheap. It has to be 'significantly' cheap or all you're doing is effectively adding operational gearing to juice ROE measurements.So, anyway. Facebook's price just jumped 20%. That means the amount of stock they can buyback now, is what they could have bought for $32bn yesterday. But now they'll have to pay $40bn for it. Effectively, the 20% jump in price aftermarket has just cost shareholders $8bn worth of cash.A series of small buyback announcements would have been more rational and effective.But, they needed a big distraction from 20% drop in EPS. They got it. 20% jump in stock price, hi-5s all around, but that fuzzy warm share price glow for a day just cost shareholders $8 billion.

POST_TEXT: b'Some people have framed diplomas. Others have framed photos with celebrities. Jeff Bezos has a framed 16-year-old copy of Businessweek magazine. On Wednesday, the Amazon founder tweeted a photo of the November 2006 magazines cover, which featured a photo of Bezos at age 42 behind the text, Amazons Risky Bet. The cover story was about why Wall Street executives doubted that Amazon Web Services, then a brand-new on-demand cloud computing service, would ever succeed. I have this old 2006 BusinessWeek framed as a reminder, Bezos, now 58, wrote in the tweet. The risky bet that Wall Street disliked was AWS, which generated revenue of more than $62 billion last year.\n\n\nIn 2006, Amazon was only worth a mere $10 billion, according to Businessweek  and investors and analysts were losing confidence in Bezos promises. The article called out Bezos for going on an ill-timed spending binge, noting that his investments in new technologies like cloud computing were up 52% since January '

POST_TEXT: b'Over the last year or two I have seen news of Amazon trying to stretch into every sector imaginable from physical retail to pharmacy etc. often there move into a new space was followed by a refrain of how they will crush existing businesses in that space and take it over, much like they took over the online retail space.\n\nNow that they have been closing stores it is an important lesson that even Amazon can stretch themselves too far and it is impossible to be all things to all people. As a holder of CVS and SPG (malls), two big would be Amazon competitors, it is validating to see that Amazon cannot successfully infiltrate every segment. And it is a good reminder to investors that just because a juggernaut enters a new space, they are not guaranteed to successfully dominate. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/exclusive-amazon-close-all-its-physical-bookstores-4-star-shops-2022-03-02/'
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 04:33:55'] They had already destroyed physical book stores.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 05:21:45'] I work for Amazon and one of the things that has made us successful is not being afraid to try something new to us, but physical stores always had me scratching my head. Amazon already proved that people prefer online for some segments of retail so why brick and mortar all of a sudden? Maybe they planned on taking the L for tax reasons? I dunno.I also saw a story yesterday about some Amazon retail stores attempting unionization and $25/hr was one of their demands. I didn't have time to read it though so I don't know if that is the case or if the author just didn't know that retail and fulfillment are not the same thing. If retail was accurate they could be related. Amazon is not going to tolerate unions. If a warehouse or retail store unionizes today, tomorrow they will begin the process of closing that fulfillment center. There are already plans in place to be able to redistribute work to other FC's due to weather. We can close a warehouse immediately and indefinitely and not skip a beat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 05:41:17'] I wouldn’t say that they couldn’t succeed at retail. Instead they are focusing on the two areas where a retail experience has the most benefit: grocery and clothing. Clothing returns online must be massive. People want to see and select their food. There is no major benefit to Amazon or the consumer to sell electronics and books through retail. The experience is the same online, and fast shipping and not having to leave your house compensates for not having the item immediately. But clothing and grocery do benefit from a physical presence.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 04:21:56'] People will, in most cases go with what they know. I have my go-to stores. Jewels for groceries, Walgreens for medicine, Walmart for personal items, and Amazon for electronics. I don't plan to change that anytime soon.

I understand your desire to feel as though Amazon can’t compete, but so far that isn’t the case. I would get out of SPG but that’s just me personally. Malls are dead.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 07:13:53'] Dude, Amazon barely "infiltrates" their own industries. Maybe cloud works out for them, but their storefront is just a poor UI repackaging of domestic producers and the most CHYNAH shit and every show I've watched of theirs has clearly been the experiment of having a chatbot write scripts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 05:46:04'] The reality is if they want they can. But its more likely they have found other ways to get better returns for their investment. They don't need to run a profitable physical store at all and they have the finance to drive others out of business. If anything it look bad as it means the sector is likely to see a downfall and not be a profitable sector.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 07:32:03'] That's sort of a bummer, the 4star stores were kinda cool.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 08:30:42'] This is the worst that that consumerism has brought down on retail industriesI love small mom and pop shops, but I hate having to  settle for a brand I know isn't good or clearly cheap (identical in many cases) $0.99 Amazon items being sold for $10 without a return policy (or just not having the heart to return it)... :/There needs to be a happy medium, like mom and pop shops will do their best to pricematch (even split the difference, I'd happily pay to keep them in business and not feel completely ripped off).I don't know the solution, but it's not going to happen by ignoring the problems we have to overcome. I know local hardware stores are able to stay in business because sometimes you pay for their expertise and experience (the kind of shit 5000 fake Amazon reviews and 3 real ones dont show you)...I also don't think it's traditionally capitalism to have a monopoly like Amazon given free reign, it never ends well for the consumer.... The amount Amazon and their warehouses even contribute to societies is also questionable, are the just moving the goal posts out further since Amazon doesn't pay fair taxes, cost of living goes up but the pay is average at best and working conditions are brutal...I had the idea of a delivery/logistics company that caters solely to small businesses for convenience (which is sort of like doordash for retail shit I guess)? That's about all we can hope for to match Amazon convenience, which seems to be their biggest advantage.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 08:31:55'] You do realize that many of the mall businesses you invested in are money losing ventures owned in some way by the malls (directly or through sweet heart deals via affiliates) themselves right? Something like half of businesses in a mall arent "real." They are actually loss leaders designed to boost traffic for the mall itself so they can make money from the other retailers in rent. The amounts vary per mall. I bring this up to point out that Amazon is probably using these spaces for marketing... seriously doubt they expected them to make money on their own. If they made a buck then great, but I doubt that was the driving theory. Brick and mortar dying has nothing to do with Amazon. They would have been in the same position if Amazon didnt exist. It would have been Target or Walmart or myleftshoe.com who took the market and we would still be in the same place they are today.If you want to blame anyone for success of Amazon, blame whoever gave us the laws of thermodynamics. Many people call him God (no not Bezos...)
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 09:36:19'] Yeah but as far as anyones concerned there still going forward with the new innovative department stores . This article is taking about the bookstores and small shops it’s owned for years. The way you word it sounds like they’ll never open another store again.Edit : “Amazon said it would focus more on its grocery markets and a department store concept going forward.”
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 10:17:38'] I didn’t even know they HAD “brick & mortar” locations. I’ve honestly never seen one and I live in a major city.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 11:29:22'] Was talking to a fellow investor the other night and they had a genius idea. Amazon should enter the shipping business. They have all the infrastructure to do so, and currently they have trucks coming back to the warehouse empty. If those trucks came back even partially full, it would be a major boon to their revenue stream.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 12:17:50'] Can go too far??!! That ship sailed a loooong time ago
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 13:28:36'] Look at the bigger picture here. They expanded into malls, so did Tesla. Now they’re pulling back as did Tesla. If large tech starts scaling back all their ambitious plans, it means job losses. Tesla was paying some people $80k a year to work doing delivery coordination in their stores. There’s all the behind the scenes stuff like real estate lawyers and industrial designers who built out the stores. These are just two examples. Multiply that by all the tech investments over the last ten years across industries now going away. Actually going away since 2018 or so. A recession was bound to happen as companies realized that they expanded too much. I saw this at my last three jobs and they were gonna lay off no matter what. Pandemic changed the script, but there’s gonna be layoffs soon enough across the corporate world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-04 03:35:02'] I knew opening up these supermarkets were dipping into too much cash
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-04 08:41:17'] Can’t and it’s not worth their time are two different things. Physical retail is a low margin declining business. They have better places to invest their money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 05:00:35'] It’s not a bad thing to try and enter each space and see how it goes. But if your approach fails, knowing when to quit and do something else is important.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 06:20:11'] honestly, this is a good thing. the primary benefit of the physical stores was giving people an easy place to return things (or potentially do pickups), and with wholefoods amazon doesn't need that.physical amazon stores were just novelty for the most part (especially since physical bookstores are a dying market anyways. there's a reason barnes and noble sells magic cards, anime figures, music/movies, kids toys, has a coffee shop, etc.)
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 06:38:42'] imo they did the perfect thing as what other successful companies dothey created stores and a marketthey got lots of attention and publicityand now that they have an even better traffic from customers who like books and understanding that physical bookstores arent that profitable they close them but still retain many users while having sunk many smaller bookstoreshappy ending for amazon and their investors

Thoughts on if this would be good/bad for WBD stock? It seems like partnering with Amazon is generally a good thing'
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 13:20:08'] All depends on the price, if it's only a deal to list it as a channel on Prime and collect 90%+ of the subsription then it's a good thing. If they are going 50-50 on a service at a lower cost on prime and getting AWS services for free it could also be a good thing to save on infrastructure.The one thing I am certain of is that it will be a good thing for Amazon, just not sure if it would be mutually benificial.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 14:57:31'] As a Prime subscriber and a fan of lots of WB's catalog I'd say this would be a plus for me. On the other hand, I already own lots of WB stuff on disc because the old CEO was big on physical media.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 14:25:17'] I'm working on this deal from the Amazon side and I just have to say it's really interesting seeing the opinions in the comments lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 15:29:38'] HBO Max is strong enough to stand on their own, and it's the only streaming service I subscribe to, so I bet they'll negotiate a good deal for them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 15:22:06'] Sounds like it might play better for WBD. Now that they are a stand alone company and have leverage with Discovery assets now.Plus they have history with a past deal.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 20:45:20'] Are you sure this actually a deal of the magnitude you imply it is? Because you can subscribe to Hulu, Showtime, and Paramount currently using your Amazon prime account. Adding HBO as a possibility would be good for both, but not as wild as it appears.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 20:20:50'] Would be direct competion to Disney?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 21:40:05'] Amazon would have to make it’s user interface actually usable for this to at all be a good thing for hbo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 08:46:01'] its 100% this channel thing unless WB wants go to theird party which would be stupid with their amount of content and IPs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 12:33:23'] Small content sharing between big studios is a bandage to a bullet wound of too much content spread across too many services.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 07:56:27'] Stocks often rally before the split occurs, usually a month in advance, so you might want to get into that on Alphabet. But if you are more comfortable buying at $150 a share rather than $2600 go ahead and wait for after the split. The price tends to dip immediately after the split, but recovers in the upcoming weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 07:59:51'] I’m hoping for DOW inclusion for both. GOOGL is my largest individual position and has been for quite some time
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 08:51:27'] If the whole reason that you’re purchasing is because of the stock split, and you’re only going to purchase fractional shares, it doesn’t make a whole hell of a lot of sense.  Back in the day that you had to purchase a whole share, stock splits helped make the stock more available to the masses. I purchased three shares of each on 3/15, and am up close to $600 on google, and over $1000 on Amazon. I only hope that continues.  When it does split in May, I do anticipate a bit of tailwinds, so I look forward to the coming months. And yes, I think Apple and Microsoft are sound investments for the same reasons.  They’re solid, and consistent.  Tesla, maybe less consistent.

You asked above if dividend stocks are “better for long term” but again this depends on your investment strategy.  If you’re looking for income, yes, dividend stocks will give this to you.Just beware and take with a grain of salt what you read on here and most importantly, do your own due diligence on the stocks recommended here rather than dumping your money in blindly.  Yes, Amazon and Google are great companies for long-term portfolios, but it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re the right companies for you, nor are they going to provide quick solutions to counteract the losses on your 401k.  In this downtrendjng market, I consider it a success if you can at least have your losses match those of the indexes (I.e. S&P) because it’s been difficult to win this year.Why not just buy an index fund like VTI?  That will be so much more diversified and safer than any individual stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 17:06:54'] TSLA, AAPL, NVDA all saw their prices peak just before the day of the stock split. I believe GOOGL and AMZN will shkw the same trend of “pre-split bullishness” too. The only question is whether its still worth it to get in now. For that i have done an in-depth analysis and intrinsic valuation of AMZN (GOOGL soon to come). Its all discussed in my YouTube (Growing Wealth)
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 18:49:01'] I know it makes them both more attractive to me, because I limit the size of the stocks I buy in my portfolio to $2k and they were too expensive before.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 10:24:58'] Everyone is suggesting google , but it’s a one trick pony ; ad sale. Given how facebook just crumbled after apple policy change , I don’t feel like google doesn’t fair well.  Last 20 years they rarely had any new innovations and all the new product initiatives failed( google phone , cloud) . I guess Android is another success but it was 10 years ago and I am not seeing lots of growth opportunities with competitions. Amazon on the other hand more diversified. AWS cloud , Amazon retail.Change my view . I am just trying to find another perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 08:24:42'] Strange answers here. Google doubled in price since one year. A clear sign that it's likely going to trade sideways for a while.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 11:14:08'] Unpopular opinion. Institutions are looking to dump massive lots, but can't with these lofty valuations. Both of these need to be more accessible to and bought up by average retail investors, before large block trades can be swiftly moved off-exchange.Why? Upside down futures bets. OI is deteriorating, while spreads and margin requirements are widening. CDS, across many global banks, have been moving parabolic for a week and a half. Profitable positions must be sold to raise margin collateral.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 01:37:22'] Buy both. Both companies are powerhouses and are leading in the tech sector. Amazon is moving to EV for delivery, have Cloud technology that helps in every aspect, and are buying up companies left and right. Both are in every household, while Google is used in everyone's everyday life in some way shape or form. Both will skyrocket after the split, so I'd buy at least one pre split, so that you have at least 20 of each. I can see both hitting at least $400-$500 almost immediately after the split, and gradually going up long term after that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 03:11:22'] Great. Posting this will inflate the stock prices soon. Was planning to get Alphabet after my end of mth pay check. Plenty of articles on the web to read on about this topic. Don’t need a new thread.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 04:00:10'] Both are solid investments, the split will bost shares bought over seas in places that don't have fractional shares .
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 06:03:03'] AWS is nice but imo Alphabet has more fields of business which have a better staying power. Search, Youtube, they have their own mobile OS, you name it... Just so many fields which i really like about em. Amazon is mostly AWS. Which is nice and a great business, but youre also paying quite well for it.

POST_TEXT: b"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-amazon-boosts-hourly-pay-103153407.html\n\nSept 14 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc hiked its average starting wage to $18 per hour on Tuesday and said it plans to hire more than 125,000 warehouse and transportation workers in the United States.\n\nThe world's largest online retailer also said it would pay a sign-on bonus of $3,000 in some locations and the hourly wage could go up to $22.50. Amazon was among the first few retailers to set a $15 an hour minimum wage in 2018.\n\nThis is a good news for amazon as it continue to expand the workforce.

I know it sounds weird but I had a other job where i was the only one getting fucked over and it sucked a ton. At amazon, you, your boss, your co workers, everyone is getting fucked. So you can’t really be mad at anyone in particular and idk, there’s some trauma bonding lol. It’s hard to explain but I remember while it was awful, i didn’t hate it as much as my other job. However, I only worked at one warehouse so maybe I just got lucky.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-14 10:03:40'] I make 27 an hour at a high stress IT job, I have not yet had yearly review and raise but where things stand now I'm making about 3.5-4% "less" based on the cost of inflation the last year. So when I ask for a raise I will not only expect a normal 3-5% raise but I will also expect it to be adjusted from inflation so now I'm expecting a nearly 10% raise. This is the problem

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-14 10:33:02'] Well, undoubtedly they can afford it since they became a primary provider of goods during the pandemic.

The pay increase is intended to bring back workers who quit and new workers who have no idea about the working conditions.

If there's not enough reason to use that - as someone else said, why wouldn't they use their credit card so they can get rewards - not sure if these buttons or whatever last if they wind up cluttering checkout screens."Does PayPal thrive"I dont think much of fintech does in the coming years. Might get a nice bounce (although even that seems to be starting to fade a little today) along with the rest of growth but fintech became oversaturated with too many companies doing the same things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 11:27:29'] Not sure how big of a deal it is, since it's just another option. Most people already have their card on file and Amazon pretty much popularized the one click purchase.That being said, I'd wait to see what Affirm says about their numbers in the earning report. Since they were added to Amazon as well, would be interesting to see if people are using that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 16:28:44'] The website sucks now. It’s all Chinese knock offs, fake reviews, and Amazon labeled products. They killed whole market places to become the king of the garbage hill.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 17:52:03'] Buying this one. I’m up 360% with amazon and AWS is the only thing that really matters.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 15:36:23'] Problem with Amazon's business: They are way too involved in everything.If their cloud services were its own company, it would have skyrocketed. But because Amazon has their fingerprints on everything, one bad segment could really hurt their projected outlook.From a company perspective, Amazon is stronger than ever. Don't mistake stock price with the company's outlook. Amazon will continue dominating and growing. Earnings report don't determine the direction of a company. It's just if you have been investing into Amazon the past year, your money has basically earned you a negative return considering that index funds would have pushed your portfolio much higher. The way I see it, long-term investors have nothing to worry about. Amazon/Apple aren't going away. Short-term, there are much better opportunities elsewhere for your money to grow. Personally, best blue chipper IMO is MSFT. Focused on what they know, continuously growing at high rates with their cloud services being a strong focus. Profit margins are absolute bananas. Last year, $60 billion profit on $155 billion revenue. With many companies using their services more than ever at an alarming rate, I like MSFT's lack of dependency in supply chain issues that Apple and Amazon has to deal with and rely on heavily.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 16:49:23'] I wish they’d spin off AWS so we have a tech cloud company and a consumer discretionary retail company. It’s weird to me that this is two divisions of the same company
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 14:25:08'] Sooo, a miss of 1% on the revenue? Am I reading this right? Should that be really be what people are looking at? I mean even the EPS, but if it was compared to a once a century event, I think whomever came with the forecast smoked something.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 15:33:57'] EVERY ecom company ( I work for a larger one) is experiencing the same issue.Last year COVID wrecked any form of a comparable baseline (this time last year the vaccine wasn't out) PLUS the supply chain crunch this year, means LESS SUPPLY and LESS DEMAND than last year--- higher prices don't account for the revenue difference.This results in fewer people shopping for more expensive goods, which results in lower Conversion rate overall. The fact that they only missed the target by a small amount if amazing, PLUS their cloud services are still killing it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 13:25:31'] It has been a frustrating year to hold AMZN. I’m starting to get impatient.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 13:24:01'] Given global supply constraints, rising labor costs, labor and product shortages, this probably was to be expected. AWS numbers beat expectations at 40% growth. The stock probably won't break out of where it has been stuck, but Amazon is dealing with issues plaguing a lot of companies in post-covid world.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 15:45:11'] Amazon would be a better stock if they just broke AWS out into it’s own company so that it continue to grow and let the retail side die as it’s going to end up doing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 13:20:26'] Big oof. Time to zoom out I guess. Though I have to admit, I haven't been excited for this stock in over a year. It's been stagnant while other big tech like GOOG has been printing. I guess it really goes to show how dependent AMZN is on the huge workforce, and there's where the problems are at currently.To buy the dip or not. Long term it might be a good option because the supply and labor crisis hopefully can be resolved at some point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 15:07:43'] AWS is the only metric that matters to me and it is still strong. Dip is another buying opportunity

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 00:00:03'] Let me guess, it will go up in value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 03:12:49'] I'm probably going to be buying AMZN at open. Their PE has dropped a lot this last year and it's trading at its cheapest valuation ever from a PE perspective.AWS is still growing rapidly. Their ecommerce disappointment was to be expected and I don't really see any long-term risks here. At the very least it seems unlikely that the stock will go much lower while having a high likelihood of achieving at least ~20% annualised returns for the next few years.I'm seeing a lot of people here commenting how other stocks are up far more as a reason not to invest in AMZN, but as usual this is probably the opposite of what you should be doing. Chasing stocks which have just been on huge runs while selling those which are begin to show value is a very risky game.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 05:34:38'] These numbers don't do the company justice --- frankly.They didn't miss on the EPS because of a lack of execution --- they missed, specifically, because of: wage increases, doubling down on fulfillment, supply constraints, etc...Beyond that, Advertising revenue continued to grow (around $8.1 Billion for the quarter) and AWS continues to be a market leader, with around 41% share of the global cloud business. Prime Video continues to show signs of solid adoption as well. Bottom line on the Q3 earnings, from my perspective: Yes, it was a miss on EPS, no question, but the company is executing on all fronts --- the out of control items (wage increases, supply constraints, trucker shortages) those will be resolved with time, and when they are, Amazon will be positioned phenomenally well for the future as they are re-investing now.NOTE: In the 4th quarter guidance, the company is anticipating spending about $4-6 Billion (Around $11.50 per share) on wage increases, fulfillment, delivery and delivery expansion.If you figure that the company, on average, has spent --- since covid began --- about $2-4 billion per quarter, over six quarters, to position themselves for the future --- that is about $23 EPS on the low end and $46 EPS on the high end that the company has reinvested into itself rather than the bottom line (not including the $4-6 billion they are expecting to reinvest into themselves in Q4 2021). Where I am going with this comment is that this is where you cannot miss the forest for the trees with Amazon. They could have easily focused on EPS, which would have certainly grown share price in the short term, rather than reinvesting and taking some pain now to position themselves and their stock growth for the long term!Facts don't lie --- eventually they will get thru the pandemic issues and related costs and the profit spicket will be turned on....MY view doesn't change, for the long term, in that Amazon and Google should absolutely be a central part of everyone's portfolio, in my opinion. I see nothing that is going to change my mind!Good luck investing to all.

Pardon my ignorance if this is an obvious question!\n\n  \nFor transperancy, I was planning on putting \\~70% of my funds into index funds (VTI and SCHD) anyway, and using the other 30% for specific stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:02:45'] What you're describing is a strategy called Core-Satellite investing.Essentially the strategy is that the core of your portfolio is index funds, and the "satellites" are individual stocks that you hope will be able to outperform the market. The benefit of the strategy is that if you can beat the market with your individual stock picks you'll still do better then the index, and if you fail to beat the market your core of index funds will stop you from trailing the market too badly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 09:46:55'] If you’re going 70% into large cap ETFs, I don’t see why you need to add more of the same exposure through individual holdings. You can buy other stocks and explore a bit more (maybe to mid caps) and still be okay if your picks aren’t stellar.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 10:24:31'] I don't see any problem with doing both. The large cap funds could easily beat VTI. Investing in both merely means that you believe in the industry but hedge your more risky bets against a more safe return. If you have a good reason to believe in a specific company then you should definitely invest in it specifically.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 09:34:42'] I mean, the idea of going with an index is that you become a passive investor. Usually indexes have requirements around who is and isn't in and companies change over time. You could totally buy some companies, but there is still a good chance that you will over perform the index. Like even right now, QQQ/SPY are seeing a lot of growth YTD from a few companies, like APPL, MSFT, and NVDA. It really comes down to how active you want to be I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 11:05:47'] risk vs reward. when you put money into amazon you bet on amazon. when you put money into vti, you bet on hundreds of companies. many of those companies will fail. also. amazon is not a fund.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 12:10:07'] Hopefully you invest where you think you will get the best returns. If you think those names will outperform the index, buy them. If you think the index will do better....buy the index.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 12:58:22'] Why VTI and SCHD instead of SPY?Why do you think these two will beat SPY?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 08:20:27'] I was invested in a long running regional utility that had 100+ years of steady to growing dividends that had never been missed.   It was located in tornado alley, and its region got hit by a super cell tornado.  Much of its infrastructure was destroyed, so no more dividend for the foreseeable future if the company even survived.   Its stock fell to fractions of what I paid even though I had held for a long time.Since that happened, I do not invest in individual stocks.   Besides with small, early stage companies, that perhaps a person has some kind of specific knowledge, where the upside is worth the risk, why take on that individual exposure when ETFs are so readily available is my argument.

A merchant can have a shopify shop and still sell on amazon, and if my reading is right can use amazon fulfilment with their shopify store?Like I don't see how this is a threat to shopify, I just see this as amazon expanding their tendrils
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 13:02:16'] I always thought Amazon logistics could be its own company, and all it would do is sell logistics as a service to companies that want to sell stuff but not deal with the actual stuff.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 17:27:34'] Amazon is going to be the biggest logistics company in the world. They surpassed FedEx, now they're coming for UPS. I can envision a world where automated trucks and drones are delivering packages 24/7 to people all over the globe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 09:50:24'] Amazing. Every time I order something from somewhere other than Amazon I think, "Why can't they do this nearly as well as Amazon can?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 06:27:38'] I only use Amazon to find a product and then buy directly from the seller when possible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 16:05:41'] This seems like such a brilliant move, with nothing except upside for Amazon (and, arguably, small providers who want to have more control over their sites), I can't believe I haven't seen it recommended/proposed before now.

I'm not sure why ppl are doing more work with the difference buying it from Amazon vs direct seller when they're going to take your money either way lol. They put their products up on Amazon and also on various e-commerce websites for a reason that is to expand their business. If Amazon is gone, so is there business. Simple.  Who wants to compete with one company that has partnered with 1000+ other companies. When you think about this, you're not any special for buying directly....But you do you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 09:35:39'] I think it's a bit immaterial at this point. It might turn out to be nice little service but I doubt it will be big enough to move the needle on Amazon's market cap. Probably that's why there's no buzz around this new service. Shopify is also a bit more than that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 11:20:38'] Sounds good but I prefer AAPL. I used to be an Amazon #1 seller.  They are largely confined now due to shipping limitations to the US, Canada, Australia and parts of Western Europe. You simply cannot ship fast and reliably elsewhere.  They cannot penetrate Asia plus now physical stores are re opened so they have a lot more competition.  Apple has no such competition, really.  Amazon I consider the #4 best mega cap after AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL.  Meta and Netflix are kicked out of FAANG so now it is GAAM, AMAG, MAAG or MAGA (oh no, not that!)I admit though I alm ost always pnly buy stocks that pay dividends. To me that shows management isn't so selfish and greedy.  Giving back to shareholders including buybacks, which AAPL does in a major way, secures my trust.   As for META we will see if the Metaverse ever works for them. In the meantime they have major problems though Instagram is still very strong. But for how long? Instagram is already starting to annoy me.

The $20 increase vs. number on cancellations may make it a wash, but it looks and sounds good to investors during the earnings call. They strategically added that into the call to draw attention away from the revenue miss.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 21:20:46'] Interesting.I suspect some may cancel, and with the reduction in volume, it may expedite shipping times that have fallen from 1-2 days to 2-5 days. Would be interesting to see if their revenue increases or decreases.Its competitors have been catching up, if not exceeding its shipping times, and although most have a bad repetition, Amazon's is infamously #1 right now with frequent incidences making news.Amazon also suffers from the reputation of grouping item of different quality in the same SKU which makes consumers more wary of its products; an issue that I have not heard of from its competitors.This move may very well incentivize people who are on the borderline of leaving Amazon and help spread word of the the quality of growth their competitors had. I can even see people making post of alternatives in the near future cause people just hate Amazon and Bezos that much.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 06:43:24'] OK, has anyone else noticed shipping fees being baked into the products price even if you have prime? Like the store down the street might have an item for $5 but amazon will sell it to me for $11.99 "but hey free prime shipping amirite?". Yes, these were items shipped by amazon not third parties that add a separate shipping fee.I've noticed this A LOT more within the past few years. Maybe I'm going crazy but it's not worth it anymore, they wouldn't do that years ago. Once everybody started using Amazon and competition started disappearing, prices seem to have increased. Reminds me of how Walmart cornered the market when they were an early company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 22:54:21'] Amazon bull here (small 15 shares bought in 2019). The earnings price movement is driving me nuts. Yes, I see that they beat (a very low-ball) EPS, even without the Rivian IPO. Yes, I see their AWS numbers growing nicely (but still a small segment and is almost the sole reason Amazon is profitable). Yes, they are raising prices which as this post shows, is a marginal bump to revenue. But their guidance is crap, their operating margins are virtually <2% on their main business. PE is still high in mid- 40s (and likely to take a dump after the rivian Q1 prices next quarter). I'm not trying to be bearish here but have no idea why the market is reacting so well to Amazon's completely mediocre (to me) performance. Honest question, hope someone can enlighten me beyond the snarky "it's been priced in" answer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:44:59'] So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.The truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.I would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?The answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.In the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.Which brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.In 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s...

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 01:10:51'] Most of the 3d printing stocks I am interested in are companies that are still private. I would really like to get in on some 3d printed housing companies like ICON. I think for 3d printing in general, it might be too late to jump on that bandwagon. But if you find markets like housing where 3d printing could actually revolutionized the way things are done, it can be a nice investment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:47:27'] URNM for green energy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 03:49:25'] As already mentioned in this thread be aware of the hype cycles surrounding these topics!Apple has been rather low-key about AI but they are very serious about it I think. Mostly so to create an AI that can understand the user’s surroundings and can be used in both AR glasses and autonomous vehicles. Tim Cook himself has mentioned they see this as their hardest problem, but one they intent to solve. Other than that AAPL in general is a great stock to own.W.r.t. green energy I’d recommend Fluence (FLNC), which is a global leader in utility battery energy storage. The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 20:40:47'] I have an interesting pick for you. I’ve been following $EOSE. Its a clean energy fully containerized zinc battery company. Its essentially a clean and portable way to power large projects. The company claims the Zinc batteries are much more efficient than lithium powered ones. In the past few months a few large hedge funds have moved in. Particularly Point72, steve cohens fund. He owns 7% of the company now and I see it moving higher eventually. It seems like a good company and I can understand what its goal is. Current price is 1.85. Experts have a low target of 3.00 (+62%), an average target of 3.25 (75%) and a high target of 11.00 (+494%). What do you think? Heres their website https://www.eose.com

Could just consider doubling that position, seeing as Tesla has and will continue to have by far the biggest market share in energy storage and probably AI/software energy (re)distribution too with AutoBidder and VPPs, both of which are way more important than energy generation for a green energy future, since solar and wind are pretty commoditized.

Picking individual titles of distruptive technologies is high risk gambling.Algonquin just cut their dividends by 40% and lost more than 50% in valuation. Investors left the boat en masse Be careful. I only have a tiny position so I'm keeping mine, still making decent dividends and I'm sure they'll bounce back in the next 20 years (my horizon).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 10:50:30'] My approach to AI stocks is a "Picks and Axes" approach. I have money in Nvidia, since their cards are almost always used in top-end computers. I have money with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft because many AI programs use cloud storage as a means to keep the data that they supply the AI models.Which company will best monetize AI? I don't know. Will they use an Nvidia graphics card and cloud-based information storage? I believe so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 11:26:54'] I'm in both Algonquin and Brookfield.  Algonquin has a tougher slog ahead given that they're targeting traditional poles and wires investments and they've recently been denied their merger with Kentucky Power and reduced their dividend. Their capital will be quite costly in this interest rate environment so at this point, I'm not sure how they can deliver above market returns. But I'm sticking with it because I'm already in the green since I bought post-dividend cut and perhaps they will surprise us with something strategically special. If not, I'll just keep collecting the half-decent divvy and hope for slow gains.Brookfield has a narrow but solid strategy. They have a decent asset growth plan and have access to relatively cheap capital through Brookfield parent. They know how to manage merchant power assets and with the knowledge they are building on the renewable side, I think they will provide decent long term returns (but no crazy beta) over other merchant generators.I'm also in MSFT and AMZN but don't have any special insights/theses that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 14:08:32'] fwiw;For tech I like AMD under 65. I think it will happen in the next 6 month. But 80 is not awful to start a position. I have a good number of shares at 78.Lots of small companies have been on a downcycle recently, so their stock performance isnt great. For the buy low sell high mantra, things are not looking horrific however. For green tech,I like RIO under 60, copper and rare earths. For more risky/speculative, I like TLGRF (battery anode + mining) at $1.00 usd or lower, which it is roughly at now. and I think something for the watch list is PYR; they might go through a reverse split in the next 6 months. if that happens, once the dust settles I will have to go in. There is no rush. I do not see the next 2 months as good for the market. I recommend waiting or DCA, and only after doing your own DD. These are ideas that I like. Two safe ones, and two risky ones.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 00:48:49'] As a non-US based in investor I think it would help US investors to look at things from the formers perspective to get a better idea of what’s happening. A lot US stocks are flat / down despite the run up in USD terms since the USD has weakened quite a lot over the past few months.As a EUR investor, the only thing that’s really ballooned again is tech when factoring in FX rates movements, and it seems to more based of potential changes in interest rate policy rather than fundamentals, because the fundamentals (both individual company & macro) aren’t trending amazingly well. My personal view is certain parts of the tech sector: APPL, MSFT etc…have taken in a lot of sideline cash in anticipation of rate pauses (or even cuts) and are currently overvalued. Great companies but not at a fair price. I had a big bag of MSFT, sold 60% this week. The rest of my holding is house money so happy to ride it out incase I’m wrong, but I think there’s more downside for tech in the short term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 15:45:22'] As long as the strike is at a price where you would be comfortable selling your position, I think CC's are hard to argue against. Traditionally your enemy is taxes but in an IRA that is irrelevant.I also really don't see a reason not to write very far otm CCs on your heavier positions if you're at all concerned with the capped upside that others on this post have highlighted. I look at something like NVDA where an EOM 350C is $60 as a good example of this. Seems like free money to me.Cash secured puts, which are more or less the inverse of a covered call, could also be worth looking into for you. They require some more meticulous planning as you really need to be comfortable with the entry price should you get exercised but if you're using the amount of cash required to make strategies like this worthwhile there is no excuse for not doing your homework.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 07:25:13'] I mean, no amount of prep work or backtesting on preset data is going to secure gains when there are more unknowns. And using anything from 20-22 isn’t great data, as a monkey could make money during Covid. Anything you can do now is apply it but 30% gains on trading is not going to happen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 07:50:14'] Being in the stock market is like being on a poker table. You have to know how you feel when real money is on the table. What do you feel if a stock goes down 10 percent on the day you bought it? And keeps going down for weeks even if there was no real news. Do you still trust your own analysis?What do you do when a stock you bought does not move at all for 12 months?

If you want to trade then fine start with really small trades and be prepared to lose 75% of it.  It hurts to lose $50 right?  Just throwing away money?  Well if you arent prepared to throw away money then dont trade because you will do that everyday.Investing for the long term is a different thing entirely.

Only one way to know is to throw your money into the market.To answer your question though, I think you're a bit delusional, but that's the case for every new trader. You only become a bit more sane once you rack up some losses imo.The market is vastly different from 2016. Patterns won't do you much good at all when the whole market is moving. Trend may show that for example, Amazon, will go up, but then a jobs report or cpi or the fed comes out and says shit and it tanks. Speaking of Amazon, their chart moved quite differently in 2016 than it does now.Market moves up and down on news, news that you can't predict accurately without insider information. You can guess, and it may work out sometimes, but all it takes is a few bad times to lose it all. Since you're talking about 30% gains, I get the vibe you're a high risk trader, so you'll feel the pain soon enough.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:12:03'] I agree with others. Paper trading or back testing is not the same with real money. I started investing in index funds over 10 years ago. I then got comfortable and started being a buy and hold investor for certain companies. I learned a lot by taking losses along the way but eventually three years ago I started options trading. I again took losses trading options until I refined my strategy and now this year I’m up 14.6% YTD (vs 8.3 for SPY). I learned from every loss and I’m still learning. I now mostly short bull put spreads, sell covered calls and open short strangles and iron condors on SPX with short legs delta 16 with 37 DTE. I’ve now learned to reduce risk and volatility and all the same time generating an exceptional return but this took over 13 years of sweat and tears and losses. And I’m still hopeful and know that to be really successful I need to show that I can beat the index over the long run and that this isn’t a fluke. Throughout my time investing I’ve learned that you must be open to new ideas. I was a big fan of indexing and buy and hold and I think for most people this works. But I’m passionate about math and trading and have found buy and hold and indexing for me actually is more volatile than doing what I do now which is shorting options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:10:00'] Trading is just a fancier term for gambling . The problem is even if you are making the right bet, your timing might be off. The stock market is very irrational. Wouldn’t recommend trading.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 21:00:57'] No, you are 100% not ready. Every beginner thinks trading is about strategy. It is not. Every strategy works sometimes and sometimes not. No strategy works all the time. Trading is 10% learning the technical analysis/strategy and 90% mindset. That’s why back testing doesn’t work. You have no emotions involved. It takes minimum 2 years to learn how to just be profitable because it takes that long to adjust your mindset.  If you are wondering what the hell is a trading mindset then you are really really really not ready. The way a trader thinks is completely different from everyday logic. That’s why it takes a long time because you’re training your brain to think in away that it has never think before. Come to r/realdaytrading if you are serious about learning how to trade. Lastly, I already know that you won’t listen and will trade with real money soon anyways. You will lose and either quit or start over and learn the correct way. Or worst you will start to win and will think you figured it out. It’s so easy. What the heck are all these people talking about. Then one day you will lose it all. Because it was all luck and you have built up really bad trading habits when you made the money in the first place. And now it’s even harder to learn the right way.  This will happen 100% of the time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 16:23:18'] Netflix’s recurring revenue and sub base could be stickier than you think. To the effect that they may even be a recession resistant name since you could argue it’s the last subscription to cut. I also think that their content ecosystem and developed brands is strong relative to competition and they have the best penetration to introduce better targeted/marketed content to the biggest audience. The data they have on viewer preferences is the best and I think they are able to leverage this against competition that may need higher per sub investment to develop the write content mix.I would also reframe your point about their competition. You could argue they have a competitive advantage as a pure play in the space. The other big names are diversified and while that brings resource and expertise I think in the end, higher capex properties, like media production and distribution, may be candidates for divestitures/spin offs. Not to say bigger players couldn’t win but it’s not a sure thing just because they have deeper pockets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:09:36'] In my opinion theyre all expensive companies. They trade with high multiples of market to book value and price/earnings/CF metrics. Not to say it isnt justified given their performances are phenomenal but all upside predictions are pricing in growth using assumptions and it is very possible they can drop a significant amount still. Although they are cheaper than before i wouldnt compare to previous levels as it wouldnt mean much. I prefer to pick my investment without using as little assumptions as possible: I picked META at $92 (250B cap at the time, 180B assets,  $105b tangible, 60B cash and marketable securities, strong FCF on a TTM, strong rev and margins close to peak) but im getting ready to sell incase things go south since things seem to be going to well for my liking.  I also chose to invest in DIS (got in at $90ish) instead of NFLX although retrospectively i would have done much better doing the opposite, but i still think it is better from a risk/reward perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:29:10'] Yeah, I don't see where Netflix goes from here. Before, Netflix was gobbling up all kinds of collections of movies and TV. Then they were expanding into making their own originals and many of those were really successful. Then the pandemic happened where people were consuming tons of TV. Now? All three of those are still going on, but I don't know if it's quite enough to maintain the massive growth of the past. Users have such high expectations of Netflix, so Netflix has to spend so much money to keep up, especially when there are competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 02:59:36'] Just my opinion, but streaming isn’t going anywhere and Netflix is optimizing for higher monthly payments. This will work because they have good addicting content. They may not grow to the moon, but they will continue to grow.Google however, is a one-trick-pony (search) masquerading as a conglomeration (Alphabet) - None of Google’s other ventures amount to anything.  The problem Google has is that ChatGPT and other AI is just about to upend search in a huge way (it’s really, really disruptive and yes, it’s that good). And once someone else wins search, Google is effectively dead overnight. Don’t think Google is dead overnight? I present to you that Google itself killed Yahoo as the default internet “start page” practically overnight. That’s *how* Google became Google.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 05:17:20'] I have a great degree of respect for Netflix as a tech company because they have been a legitimate innovator in terms of building a very intelligent SoA system, tons of microservices, their architecture and blogs are very fascinating reads to see how a world class organization handles it's data and systems. They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.However today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.Middle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.Netflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. I think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience. A true event that they have to capture at the designated time because otherwise they feel left out when their peers are talking about it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 06:03:41'] It's even worse than you lay out.  NFLX debt and content obligations are so much more crippling than most realize.  And their debt is all rolling over into a terrible credit environment.  Their clueless execs have pledged to keep increasing content spend, which they can't afford, and soon, won't be able to finance either.  And content costs will be bid up by their much richer competitors.  They hit customer saturation several years ago, and hid it with their silly metrics.  They hit price saturation at covid re-opening.  So they can't grow subs, and they can't charge them more... but they have to.  Their funky and false way of claiming "profitability" won't hold up to tougher scrutiny.They're doing their usual shell game of pretending there's growth with the shiny object of ad-tier.  But you don't make an ad-service that requires customers to sign up and pay.  That's why they had to refund all their advertisers.  And the ad-tier will cannibalize their existing subs/pricing anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 11:15:46'] >It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers.It's not a vicious cycle, it's theoretically a virtuous cycle when done correctly. In fact, it is the bedrock of Netflix's business model. [Check out Netflix's flywheel](https://jenvandermeer.org/2020/06/09/netflix-business-model-teardown/)You cannot compare Google and Netflix. They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)Also, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).Their gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. TLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't. Very different companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 04:45:06'] They are making delivery trucks for Amazon and that business has lot of potential. At least where I am, I see lot of Amazon electric trucks. They will be fine in the long run. In short run it will be lot of pain.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 06:27:43'] this is one of the new EV carmakers that I have actually seen quite a few cars on the road. I think they did a good job with the ramp and their strategy of pick-up trucks and large SUVs targeting outdoors work well in differentiating them from the market, especially since tesla cybertruck won't achieve mass production until next year. I think this is a decent price range to start building a position on.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 13:21:09'] A couple things to point on why the stock does well. For one people are holding to their cars for longer. [https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/americans-holding-onto-their-cars-longer-than-ever.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/americans-holding-onto-their-cars-longer-than-ever.html)This means the need for autoparts will be higher. Since in theory a new car will not need as much maintaince. In fact, that article came out in 2015, if you look at their revenue growth:[https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/orly/financials/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/orly/financials/)It's pretty solid. Nothing crazy, but they are still growing like 7%ish a year. You'll notice another import factor, the number in 2020. During the pandemic, the supply chain wrecked the new car market. This has a ripple effect. It means people will continue to hold onto used cars, but also this impacts the car rental market. Since they were holding onto used cars for longer, there as more demand for autoparts. This is because of the way warranties work on cars. You usually get 3 years or X amount of miles for full coverage. So it's in the advantage of rental car companies to buy new and sell used.

I personally believe google has more upset than Amazon since they’re more “techy” (although I fully realize how well Amazon is operating on a technological  level). I just find more overall upside with google  and if you’re so torn between them…. Why not do both? Both companies have amazing financials/fundamentals.

GOOG is the king of online user generated streaming content (youtube), googlemaps and search there really is no viable 2nd place competitors (Bing plz dont make me laugh). The one big negative about GOOG is there commitment to projects.

Both will continue to grow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 22:03:39'] I read the book The Intelligent Investor and it’s the topic about stock buy backs. Normally, it’s seen as a good sign because the company is so confident of its future that it’s buying its own stock. However, the author noted that sometimes stock buy back happens when insiders wants to cash out and the buy backs prevents the stock from dropping.This argument, and stock splits seems a good combination for insiders off loading and making the buy price of a share cheap enough for retail investors to load up?Does it make sense or not?
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 01:17:17'] I really like Amazon and bought one share a week ago. I think politics will make google a scapegoat which imo will lower it's projection. I will get google in the future but idk
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-23 03:16:42'] I would say AMZN first if you are short on funds to get both. AMZN splits first, which you can get in and sell a few days pre-split, and use the funds to get into GOOGL. But there are lots more that you need to understand besides that, like the market sentiment and the valuation of the companies etc. You may check out my social in my profile, I explained further there.

Walmart has a history as a company that forces employees to work without overtime, pays them little enough or limits hours intentionally for employees to rely on government programs, and works to undercut brands by driving them out of business  after striking some deal of being their primary if only source of their product. That’s why I prefer target. They may not be 100% right but there’s a reason why target cost a bit more than Walmart’s very cheap prices.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 03:05:56'] IF (big if) Walmart can get their shit together regarding online grocery, they could absolutely slap Amazon. Think about how close you are to a Walmart vs an Amazon distro center. Granted Amazon is growing insanely quick but I think for the moment Walmart has a better distro network IF THEY GOT THEIR SHIT TOGETHER!! They could get shit to most people within two hours easily. I work in online grocery at Walmart and there are SO MANY KINKS that they really... REALLY need to work out. Worker accountability and productivity is a huge issue, inconsistent DoorDash drivers, inconsistent pickup process at different Walmarts, not enough equipment for employees. They really should try to snatch an exec from Amazon to help out the actual fulfillment and picking process. And revamp the delivery, drop GARBAGE DoorDash drivers that come to pick up the order and leave a bad taste in customers mouths.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 05:12:30'] Loads of good comments here but I think what a lot of folks are missing is that Walmart isn't a store for middle income + earners, it's a bargain based retailer that targets primarily the lower income brackets. These are the individuals who cannot afford the higher cost of goods sold by Amazon. Also, these lower wage earners typically purchase in person rather than online. Many don't have credit cards or even bank accounts and strictly deal in cash. \~20% of the population only deal in, or specifically prefer, cash.As we've seen over the last few decades, the middle income earning bracket is shrinking from over 60% to under 50% while the low and high income brackets are expanding. What this means is that companies who typically benefited from middle and higher income earners will not experience the growth of customer base that a lower income targeting company would. Obviously the margins are greater the higher up you go on the wage ladder but Walmart isn't in exactly the same retail space that Amazon is. I think Walmart will continue to see growth for quite some time, especially during a recession. And they will also have arguments that supporting Walmart over Amazon benefits the working class because they won't swap their employees for robotic machinery (at least yet). We all saw the impact of the 'Made in America' campaigns.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 06:38:00'] I had almost assumed that they had already surpassed Walmart.  One good thing that has come out of their competition is that both have brought their minimum wage way up.  As the largest retailers, that makes for a lot of employees benefiting from the back and forth (even with the push for automation).  Ultimately Amazon has much more behind it as an entire company.  If Walmart wants to compete at that scale they have a lot of work to do and a lot of various segments in which they will need to involve themselves through expansion and acquisition.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/andy-jassy-on-inflation-surcharge-amazon-cant-keep-absorbing-costs.html\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company needed to add a fuel and inflation surcharge to deal with rising costs tied to inflation, the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine. At a certain point, you cant keep absorbing all those costs and run a business thats economic, Jassy told CNBCs Andrew Ross Sorkin in a Squawk Box interview on Thursday. Amazon has tried to assume all those costs wherever possible, Jassy said, but it became increasingly untenable as the pandemic continued and after Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year. On Wednesday, Amazon imposed a 5% fee to U.S. third-party sellers who use its shipping and storage services. The surcharge will go into effect in about two weeks for sellers who use Amazons Fulfillment by Amazon program. Merchants pay to have their inventory stored in Amazons warehouses and to make use of the companys supply chain and shipping op'

To put in perspective, if markets were flat, amazon alone would contribute 0.3% in sp500, 0.63% in QQQ, 1.65% for consumer disc sector.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 16:20:34'] I think Amazon’s deteriorating outlook isn’t all about pandemic “pull forward” and people shopping brick-and-mortar more lately — conservatives like me are cancelling their prime memberships left and right, for obvious reasons. I used to shop Amazon a couple times a month, and also had subscriptions to Amazon music, Kids, etc, but will never spend another dime with them again. That’s what happens when “woke” corporations alienate half their customers. Of course, Amazon management won’t ever admit it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 07:22:37'] Collapse is unlikely.  But time can really do a number on companies.  Ford still exists but it’s not the behemoth it once was.  At&t still around but you don’t think about it how you once did.  Yahoo and AOL once monsters, bought by another company.   You don’t think about IBM or Microsoft as the powerhouses they once were.  Anyway I don’t expect Amazon to fail.  Buuut 20 years is a long time.  What if self driving cars takes away the mega-advantage Amazon Prime was giving them or computing costs go down 100x and cloud infrastructure gets more competitive.  In 20 years shifts like that are very possible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 08:37:34'] I don’t see amazon collapsing like bear sterns but the business doesn’t need to colllapse for the valuation to come down. Intel still makes a ton of money and is one of only a few companies that delivers a much needed product—but look at their stock performance. Much of amazons success is already behind it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 07:09:03'] Jeff Bezos himself went on record as saying Amazon's days are numbered.By this point Amazon is a company that has willfully insulated itself from customer feedback.  I believe Amazon has peaked and is in decline. They have tentacles in so many pies, so many revenue streams, the process will be long and protracted.If you want a company that I think is in the process of imminent collapse, look at Facebook.  Only one revenue stream to speak of, and the word on the street is the quality of their traffic has gone off a cliff.  With an institutional track record of misleading the public, how do we think Facebook will respond if unable to supply the demand for clicks on the part of their advertisers?  #ClickFraud

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 07:12:56'] Companies generally have to have substantial debt in order to go bankrupt. They could still go down 95% though just due to competition or something (though obviously this is vanishingly unlikely), and that's almost the same thing from an investors perspective.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 07:40:19'] They won't collapse, just become a smaller organization. Their retail side will be the part that becomes unprofitable, the other ventures will keep them viable. There will be a reorganization of sorts in the next decade, but it will still be a good company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 07:45:04'] there is also a chance of the opposite happening, AMZ is heavily invested in R&D, they might discover or invent something in the near future, we can't possibly imagine today, then they would shoot up, or any other company doing the same and gobbling up amazon, even though that seems unlikely today
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 08:06:51'] It takes a war for companies like these to go down. Amazon is the provider of an entire ecosystem (AWS and e-business) and let's not forgot why it exists in the first place.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 09:54:09'] Bezos saw it coming and took off. From what I can tell he does not believe the high margin can be sustained in the future and is looking for other business to pursue.  Online sales, Capital 1, JD and Walmart seem to catch on fast.  That business is based on prime subscription.  It will get spun off merge with another company along with trucks and warehouses eventually.AMS is the bread and butter but Microsoft, Google are not far behind. There are many companies love to take away some AWS shares. If it focus of its high margin service it can sustain. One reason Amzn never paid you or other investors a penny of dividend after being in business so long. It puts all its net profit into infrastructure. It never really paid any corporate income tax.  Trump has in the past threaten to break the company up several times want it look like just another AT&T.  Can you imagine the largest employer in America does not pay income tax.  So long it will not do illegal things it will thrive. Will it be the larger employer in 10 years?   Not sure.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 10:40:10'] Biggest long term risk to Amazon is US decides to break it up using anti-trust law. It’s a pretty open and shut case if govt wanted to do it. Amazon being a huge intel and DOD partner through AWS and sending all your Alexa data to the NSA is probably partially insurance against US DOJ moving against them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 11:40:17'] Much more likely that it will be broken up for antitrust reasons.They have a predatory advantage in that whenever a seller is showing profitability, Amazon comes in and either acquires them or buys a competitor to direct compete against them and crush them because they can sell at a huge loss, put them out of business, and then raise their prices to profitability once the competition is eliminated.They can be a platform for vendors and customers to come together or a seller of products, they shouldn't be allowed to be both.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 12:42:59'] It depends what you mean. As others have said, its unlikely Amazon will exist as it does indefinitely.It is likely that others will continue to try and cut-in on its territory just as is happening to Netflix with streaming. No advantage is indefinite. Though size and capital do secure a certain amount of future proofing as far as tech advancements go, it doesn't prevent against competitors for market share. It it pretty easy to imagine AWS being spun off into a separate company, or any number of other Amazon's divisions for that matter. Look at the history of companies like Westinghouse or Paramount. Even if those companies, in some form exist, or even have the same name as they did, they often change, or take on other business as acquisitions or simply the development of continuing to deploy capital effectively to different opportunities. There is a limit to what consumer markets amazon can serve based on its cost-benefit ratios(consumer, employee, owner). Which is why other companies are able to stake out their own claims in different regions with what we perceive as copycat or derivative business models faster than Amazon can grow there. (Coupang, Jumia, BABA, JM, Pindoduo, OZON, Flipkart). Some like Walmart(with Flipkart experience) and Target have a pretty good chance of broad competition in the US market down the line, and other companies have their own chances in their respective niche. Think Williams-Sonoma.  I do think anti-trust regulation is unlikely the way politics in USA work and with how anti-worker pro-business most politicians are. I would love unionization for all Amazon workers. I do think that is maybe the only legitimate threat to the fundamental business model in the USA, which as you may be aware is dependent on low-cost labor both domestically and abroad. I don't see Amazon's dominance declining significantly for the next 8 years or so, possibly even 15. Though there any many more unknown unknowns than known unknowns, so i could always be wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 14:52:07'] I think the odds are very low for a complete collapse like Lehman. but the odds are higher for a slow decline of some type. tcompanies rarely stay in the top 10 for more than about a decade. Microsoft and Apple are two rare examples, or General Motors and General Electric a few decades ago. more often they stay in the top 10 for a few years, then drift down the list. look at the top 10 U.S. companies from 1970 or 1980, even 2000. most of the companies are still around but nowhere near as dominant. General Electric, Exxon, IMB, Philip Morris/Altria, US Steel, General Motors, etc. the same thing will happen to Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, and today's other dominant companies, they'll all get gradually displaced.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 15:44:25'] I think this is a really interesting question!  The clearest analog to Amazon in the early 21st century may be the Sears Company in the late 19th century. And... Sears just went out of business in the last 5 years. Its business model wasn’t current for the last 30 years or so, but entrenched market positions can stay alive for a long time. By the time Sears failed, the economy had changed radically around it. (Several times!) My sense is that Amazon won’t ever fail *in this economy*— it will take some big changes in the economy that we can only guess at now. What changes might come? Nanotechnology and active assemblers would make the “shipping manufactured goods” business a dinosaur. AI-driven autonomous corporations that could manage their own logistics might decentralize the things that Amazon has done so well for us so far. Nearer-term, a congressionally mandated split-up separating the AWS cash cow from the steady smaller margins of Amazon proper might change its velocity, but probably not its market advantages. AWS is a F powerhouse.I’m curious what anybody else has to say!
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 17:24:44'] Probably not collapse but the reality is all these companies will stop growing eventually and it could happen really soon.The thesis of so many people on this sub that you should buy mega cap tech stocks and hold forever is not a good idea. You might actually lose a lot of money in the long-term doing that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-29 09:29:57'] Even though they don’t do most deliveries, they sub-contract it out and rape them to do it. That’s why you sometimes see UHaul vans delivering your Amazon packages. It removes risk on their part, and allows them to control it even more. Some say it’s good business, I say is shitty business practice for the consumer.

Since everyone is talking about an upcoming recession in the late 2023 would it be wise to wait off to buy back in assuming the market will crash.\n\nI am aware that in a long run the stocks Im looking to buy will most likely thrive in a long run such as Apple, google, Microsoft, Tesla. Im just looking for the best opportunity considering the circumstances.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 18:46:06'] I will refrain using this opportunity to buy these high fliers thinking they will go up forever.  My best performing and worst performing stock happens to be Tesla which has way too much volatility. Today Elon says this, next day something caused -7% fall.  I reduced my position and will do so soon. I once held MSFT and INTC long ago, thinking like you. Bought around 2000. It took MSFT 16 years to recover.  With INTC I did not know they had more Pentium chips in the warehouse could not sell never disclosed.   Today not profitable again, live on government subsidized grant not by itself.  The portfolio during current economy is not the same you and I would had two years ago.

Right now there are too many bears waiting for a crash and too many bulls screaming no recession. Well right now both are wrong and we are creating a giant balance the past months, waiting for something to happen. Be patient stay in cash and if we see some real actually strength buy into it. If we see death and destructing and pure blood buy when u see base and break.

Bond market dwarfs the Stock Market,  its risk free, free money.   And when the Fed isn’t greedily hogging down all the bonds, it’s a lot of Risk-free Free Money.   When the pivot comes, the pigs will rush out to feast and the big boys will dump dump dump on them.   This is called Exit Liquidity.    Wait for after the culling of the pigs

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 17:08:54'] TBF my advice is to reinvest with stops that you incrementally move up as you get more in the money. The "recession" will never be made public until it's already happening (look at 2008-10) and there's seemingly no end to the free money, despite the fed raising rates little by little.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 17:12:17'] You can diversify your investments by choosing stocks in specific sectors, such as health care, resources, energy, etc., to ensure that your investments will grow steadily during a recession, and you can also invest in some real estate

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 19:57:50'] You are wasting your time and this is ultimately just gambling. Neither company has proven their products are worth anything. Wait till they become profitable and then analyze whether or not they have legs. Sofi specifically is just a bank. Absolutely nothing special about them. There is no such thing as "fintech." Its a made up word designed to fool investors. PLTR is not a tech company any more than any other defense contractor is a tech company. I seriously doubt their commercial side will ever be profitable. Not by much anyway. Gov contracts are great but the hard part is landing them. Also their valuation is ridiculous. Recall its a 20 year old company and has been losing money for years. Its not a startup. They are about as old as Google. $15b on $2b rev is foolish.

POST_TEXT: b'The prevailing "wisdom" of this sub is that TSLA is a good business with an overvalued stock. I am here to illustrate that this is not the case - the stock is not overvalued.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 23:57:36'] Doesn't Amazon do some funky things with their revenue like lose money on purpose or something though?  I think they could earn more but throw it into various projects or buying companies or  some such.  Their Revenue/Market Cap is way higher than Tesla.  In short they have way different business philosophies so is that valuation a fair comparison?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 00:16:40'] I think there are several reasons to it.1. Moat. Amazon has a well-established moat in several of its core businesses. Tesla is said by some to have one of the strongest moats ever: data, software and hardware for FSD. This will give them a massive edge in the FSD segment which is huge. Others say they have no moat and their millions of miles of data is rivalled very well by billions of virtually driven miles; their software and NPUs are rivalled by e.g. NVDA's DRIVE suit. For Amazon, there is no real debate on whether they will dominate their given business segments.2. History. Amazon has arguably a longer history as a company which has gone through several boom-bust cycles, hence they have "proven" they are able to navigate rough waters. History is extremely important in the stock market and a long-lasting company with a stable management is worth a lot. And then you have Elon Musk.3. China. Tesla sold 1/3 of their cars in China (of the last quarter). China is the biggest car market in the world and its plans to include EVs into their everyday life are set in stone (5-year plans). It is, however, a little risky to have such huge business in China nowadays. On the contrary, it is a big benefit to have revenue streams in different currencies and be diversified geographically; not only does it increase the TAM you can capture but it also helps vs currency devaluations. Amazons business is concentrated to US and EU mostly. Highly regulated markets, which is a benefit also.4. Debt interest. This is related to many other indicators and shows how "trusted" corporations are by big banks. Amazon's effective interest rate (latest twelve months) is \~1.4%, for Tesla it is more than double that with \~3.3%. Hence, Amazon is not only able to refinance debt for lower levels, the market is trusting Amazon more than Tesla if it comes to lending money. If you want to compare two companies, first thing to do is compare the interest they pay on the debt they issue. According to this, the valuation must be higher for Amazon, because they are less likely to default.In other words, Tesla incorporates much higher levels of risk into your portfolio than Amazon, even though you pay roughly the same for their earnings. From a risk-perspective, Tesla is the worse deal here.Ofc there are many reasons besides the metrics you and I discuss here that are important. I should clarify that I own shares of both companies.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 16:36:53'] Wow. There's a lot to unpack here. First, you're comparing a company with over 400b in revenue (Amazon) to a company with around 14b in revenue (Tesla)Second, the only reason the price of Tesla is this high would be future earnings, it's definitely not worth this market cap on current earnings. Which leads to...Third, you're saying because they only have 1% of the auto market, their future growth prospects are bigger, but many analysts are saying that Tesla is starting face much higher competition in the EV market. Some are better cars at lower prices without a 6-12 month wait.VW, Ford, Audi, Kia and Hyundai are putting out some great EVs now. Even Musk has acknowledged Hyundai's progress on the market.Their future growth always depended on going beyond cars. Their market cap wouldn't be justifiable if they are just a car company. Self-insurance of their cars, autopilot tech (which seems to be failing), and information gathering, battery tech, charger network, are areas they need to grow and monetize.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 03:57:19'] Quite a few things to unpack here:> So what other company and stock can we compare that is as at the same size as Tesla with very high growth prospects and is widely considered a good business AND a good investment? Amazon!These are in completely different industries, with different characteristics, capital requirements etc. It makes zero sense to compare them. &#x200B;>So to sum it up, Tesla is actually less richly valued than Amazon based on current and 2023 earnings multiples, the analysts have consistently underestimated Tesla despite revising earnings estimates up while analysts have consistently overestimated Amazon despite revising earning estimates down, and Tesla earnings are more certain than Amazon's. As a reminder, Tesla has much more room to grow with only 1.5% of the car market compared to Amazon's 40% share of online retail.Tesla's estimation if you look at them use a high multiple growth combined with the same margin as it has now. Given that the cheapest Tesla is 46k, there is a limit to how far you can grow (which would be around 2-3m cars for Tesla with their current lineup). Additionally while Tesla does have room to grow, they are valued as though they would have 10m sold cars with twice the margin, ASP and valuation as Toyota. &#x200B;>Based on my own estimate, I believe Tesla will actually accomplish 2023 earnings of $23.81 per share (compare to analyst consensus of $14.51) by expanding revenue over 50% in 2023 with new factories ramped up in Berlin and Austin, gross margins well in excess of 30% due to economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies at their new factories as well as near 100% margin software sales, while operating expenses grow slower than revenue growth. IWhy do you think they will grow by 50%. Berlin and Austins have problems ramping up. Gross Margins (which are meaningless in car manufracturing due to the labor cost) will go lower as most commodities have increased significantly. Furthmore, the Tesla Model 3's growth profile is slowing by a significant margin in the last quarter. I think it is actually more likely for Tesla to have no growth in 2023, than to have 50% given their struggles with the factory ramp ups outside of China. &#x200B;>In other words, the trend of analysts underestimating Tesla combined with Tesla's relatively reasonable valuation multiple (as discussed above) could provide a tailwind to the stock over the next 12-16 months and take it to new highs.Tesla's valuation looks reasonable, but are not if you include the costs that are associated with being a car manufacturer. Given the headwinds of the economy, inflation (rents and food are still rising), an aging line-up without any refreshes and the FED hiking interest rates (making car loans more expensive), I don't think that Tesla will grow in 2023. I also think that Tesla is similar to Cisco. A great company, that was just too promising. Here is my prediction. Tesla will not see ATH for the next decade.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 13:21:35'] Good read. Thanks for sharing. In my opinion the market will not have the patience required for the marginal scenario in your base case especially because I expect capital markets to remain difficult and worsen over the next 1-2 years. Apollo has plowed money into this pig however - they are big enough to bail them out if they are willing to throw good money after bad….but that’s unlikely IMO. That being said - shorting CVNA is a death trap as well. For now. I’d probably short the stock above 25 if borrow rate was reasonable and position below 5% of my trading account balance. Squeezes will occur and if they ever plan to announce another offering you can bet it will be preceded by an underwriter led manipulation that takes the stock to a ridiculous peak (perhaps low 30s even)

Create model with insane profit margins, but a far nicer experience, and make that experience the new status quo.Problem is, seems like Carvana and their peers weren't bothering with the insane profit margins part of the idea.  Everyone I knew was giddy at the irrational offers Carvana was making for their junkers.They foolishly all thought you can lose catastrophic amounts of money to buy "market share" in a market that's not really that renewable.Better to just let market share grow organically while protecting margin above all else.Consumers are ok with overpaying for assurances and some reliability in the experience.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 04:29:32'] They both are wildly overvalued
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 05:22:59'] Lots of differences to consider here, but at the end of the day whether one or the other is overvalued or undervalued really depends on your projections. Personally I like AMZN, but I don't like TSLA, so let me try to explain why...Arguably AMZN's revs are higher quality because the segment that makes all the money (AWS) is recurring, business essential and operating in a sector of the economy with secular growth tailwinds. TSLA's revs on the other hand aren't recurring, largely tied to consumer health and vehicle sales trends and not in a sector with similar secular growth tailwinds (personal vehicle sales). You could argue EVs have growth tailwinds which I agree with, but in years to come when all automobiles sold are EV that distinction will disappear and then TSLA will just be a regular car company like all the others.I think many investors would also argue that AMZN has significant room for margin expansion and that today's earnings don't fairly represent AMZN's earning potential. TSLA however already has sector-leading margins and those will almost certainly come under pressure with increased competition.My issue with TSLA's valuation is that unlike tech the automobile industry has always been a very competitive place to operate and the consumer is highly segmented. You can't expect TSLA to dominate the automobile industry in the same way we might expect AMZN to dominate ecommerce and cloud services. TSLA's brand isn't going to appeal to every demographic and TSLA isn't going to capture a disproportionately large percentage of the market.But if you don't think TSLA is going to face significant competition then it's probably a good buy honestly, but that's not because of the growth potential, but because of the margins. The reason big tech can sustain such large valuations isn't their revs, but their insanely high margins which are due to a lack of competition. Toyota has similar revs to GOOG for example but their valuation is no where near GOOG's because they can't demand the same margins. This is the fundamental risk with TSLA and why I don't care about growth projections. If TSLA is fairly valued it will have much more to do with competition and margins. I worry about both.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 03:54:24'] >Is Tesla undervalued, especially when comparing it to Amazon?Can't be compared.

And Tesla has the means to fund this growth. They are making a lot of money now and have $18 billion in cash.I can project anything I want, but that does not make it true. Given the current growth rates Tesla won't hit that 50% annual growth, and the more cars they make the harder it will get. Additionally their car lineup is aging rapidly and the growth rates currently are very similar to that of the S a few years ago. Chances are high, that unless they introduce a new refresh that they growth will stall at around 2m cars -  making them overall overvalued.

So from that POV alone the stock is criminally undervalued. That said: PE is a pretty pointless metric when looking at a growth company so the comparison to the PE of Amazon doesn't really mean anything (and I really don't get why people even look at that number wrt Tesla)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 06:48:05'] PE of ecommerce companies are generally much higher than car companies. Look at ali baba, very beaten down and still has a PE of 41. Im happy to buy amazon even though its 3X as expensive as ali baba. Also amazon has a wide moat because their logistic infrastructure as well as their unprecedented R&D investments. They spent a crazy percent of earnings trying to either get ahead in existing industries or expand into new ones. Now consider tesla, who has excellent pricing power, revenue growth and innovative edge on things like self-driving tech. VW and other legacy car manufacturers are expanding into the EV space. VW in particular seems like a candidate to eat into tesla’s EV market dominance. VW is aggressively ramping up EV production and has more than 4X the revenue of tesla. I think tesla will remain in the lead for EVs but will lose some dominance in the next few years. Tesla’s PE is currently 20X higher than VW, so im more optimistic on amazon over tesla.

The retailer portion of Amazon has a tougher future as it works on logistics to keep others at bay.Tesla doesn't have something like that. Maybe battery tech? Anyway, it has not yet created a market for something besides cars. With EVs, it's going to have a tough time as rivals continue to enter into the space that is it's primary revenue source.It doesn't help that Musk seems hell-bent on tweeting away any nostalgia around him.

No one will come close for at least 3 years and by then FSD or Tesla bot or solar/ battery storage may be the big money maker. If all 3 come into giga production scale Tesla will be the biggest most valuable company the world has ever seen.

The problem is that it’s unlikely to materially affect Apple’s bottom line for years and they are notoriously hard on suppliers.

POST_TEXT: b'More than 24 hours after Microsoft announced its plans to purchase Activision for nearly $70 billion, aggressive trustbusters in Congress were uncharacteristically quiet.\n\nThe silence underscores how Microsoft has carved out a distinct reputation among policymakers, distancing itself from the political scrutiny embroiling its top competitors in Washington. As Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google were marshaling their Washington resources to beat back competition legislation up for debate on Capitol Hill this week, Microsoft smoothly announced one of the largest acquisitions in the history of the tech industry.\n\nThe lack of scrutiny could be in part due to Microsofts reputation as an enterprise tech business, which does not necessarily generate the same headlines as social media, smartphones or e-commerce, according to Harry First, co-director of Competition, Innovation and Information Law program at New York University.\n\nMicrosoft is also less exposed to the content moderation controver'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 15:56:10'] Microsoft learned long ago to always ensure you have "competition".
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 18:42:54'] Being big isn't a crime.  Using your power to unfairly destroy competition is.  For example, Google has already been fined over $10B in the EU for anti competitive behaviour.  So it's really no surprise that thee US would see them similarly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 16:54:13'] Facebook couldn't even buy giphy some gif sharing platform.  None of the big tech even try to make acquisitions they are so scared.  Meanwhile MSFT is throwing cash around.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 19:20:27'] Zuckerberg, is that you?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 17:10:00'] The future could prove me wrong, but I find the hand wringing about the ATVI acquisition to be rather comical. Obviously MSFT is a mammoth company in various ways, but it's hard to see how becoming the third biggest gaming company is anything close to monopoly status, particularly when #1 and #2 have exactly the same hardware-software integration as they do. It's true that it may marginally hurt some consumers (for instance, some ATVI titles that are on multiple platforms might over time become XBox exclusive) but it is hard to imagine that DOJ is going to get too excited about a possible small advantage that MSFT gains in first person shooter games, or whatever it might affect.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 20:37:51'] My understanding is that Microsoft is a big player in a very large number of fields, but doesn't actually have a monopoly in all of those fields. As it stands, I still think Sony is a very strong competitor to Microsoft, although the Xbox Game Pass is going to become very compelling when Xbox has more exclusives than just Halo and Forza. I also think that their push to PC gaming is beneficial for the community, although I recognize that they still get the majority of the profits and the games are probably only compatible with windows for the most part.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 21:28:37'] Because Microsoft isn't as bad as the rest.I would be concerned if there were regulators blocking the Activision deal. There's so many game developers out there that there is no shortage of competition at all. Valve's Steam is the closest thing to Apple or Google in getting their cut out of developer's game sales. Android and iOS on the other hand are literally the only two options for mobile. There are competing desktop OSes (mac and linux)There are free and competing office productivity software.Microsoft isn't the leader in CRM software.Cloud has lots of players.Where's their monopoly?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 19:50:36'] What exactly does MSFT have an unfair monopoly on? Software nobody actually wants to use? The Office package is the only thing I can think of where their market reach is so deep nobody  even knows how to open spreadsheets that aren't .xls, but I wouldn't say it's a monopoly when you have to pay extra for it, and you can use google docs for free.

Not that they do not lobby or court politicians, they do it under the cover and it is paying off.  In the $10B JEDI contract it was a victory for Microsoft even though it was pyrrhic victory as the contract was cancelled.It is a more astute and suave/savvy Microsoft, not necessarily a kinder and gentler Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 08:36:05'] This is not a monopoly in gaming or anything resembling a monopoly. They are only now the 3rd largest in game development.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 09:42:55'] And this is another reason why I think Microsoft is the big tech company you ought to own shares in. I understand the concerns that are being raised about its acquisition of Activision, but the mute reaction from congress shows what the company is doing right. Amongst big tech, Microsoft is the safest bet to weather the political storms, controversy, oversight, and regulations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 10:18:01'] The thing is Microsoft is more "diversified" and they have more "competition". So they're not seen as a monopoly now...Plus they have a friendly aura. Same as FB has the evil auraPlus, they work for the Pentagon
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 13:20:01'] I'm not sure but Microsoft isn't the leader in gaming. They might be behind Nintendo and Sony in terms of consoles. I think the acquisition will be scrutinized but because there are other players who may be beating them in marketshare, this may pass the smell test.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 11:46:59'] "In the past we have seen rallies post-stock split."While NVDA was fine last year post-split, you have it backwards with the case that really comes to my mind (Apple/Tesla 2020). They had one big day post-split and then got killed initially. It was Tesla's addition to the S&P that re-sparked it.Disclosure: I was very little when dot.com was going on. It's possible there were times back then where you had a split and stocks continued running for a while after them. I just don't think that'd be the deal here. If Amazon can continue and have a big month this month, it's probably mostly due to something else (and the S&P and Nasdaq likely had a month similar to March this year then).

The smaller price is more significant to options than shares because you generally need to deal contracts in lots (typically 100 shares).

Those types of PEs are for high growth companies expecting to blow up I. Revenue and profit. How much bigger do you really think Amazon can get? Compare to Apple with a PE of 24 and a EPS of 6. This stock has always had a pie in the sky price.

I used to order a lot of stuff (even things I’d consume like whey protein), but wound up cancelling Prime a year ago over concern of counterfeit products. Can’t even do your own DD on what you’re buying a lot of the time since Amazon seems plagued with fake reviews.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 13:45:39'] Seems like an overreaction, dont hold too much amazon but still believes in them. But tbh these earning crashes are necessary if we want to come out of inflation issue soon, cant have both outperformance AND low inflation, just doesnt happen
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 13:51:28'] Everyone talking about how Amazon isn’t going anyway so a drop shouldn’t happen.  Why aren’t you also demanding VZ or JNJ or PG have P/E ratios of 100?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 06:16:44'] I mean Amazon was already overvalued, it had like a 60 PE after already conquering the online retail and cloud market. A non-growth company typically has a PE around 10.

David Risher, a former retail executive at Amazon, will assume the CEO position at the ridesharing company.\n\nGreen and Zimmer founded Lyft in 2012 and took the company public in 2019. Lyft shares have fallen more than 70% in the last year alone.\n\nRisher joined Amazon in 1997 as its first vice president of product and store development. He was a top lieutenant of Amazon founder and executive chairman Jeff Bezos, and went on to serve as senior vice president of marketing and merchandising before exiting the company in 2002.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 18:52:02'] These two owners are so far out of their league and this guy Risher is a nobody who’s been in semi-retirement for 20 years living a life of leisure.

To save on costs, they closed/got rid of all in person, live support in cities like Chicago, Nashville and elsewhere.Now any attempts by riders or drivers to access support deal with chat bot question/answer loops or remote chat based support from india/pakistan, whose ONLY performance metric is how few claims/errors they pay out money for.Driver pay was cut by 30% in January as well, in a desperate attempt to attain profitability..They've been around for 11 years, developing a model where the drivers, are responsible for everything and yet they still can't turn a profit. Aside from running the servers, the company has almost no costs, because anything not part of the corporate skeleton staff is based off the independent contractor model, where there is no accountability, no protection, minimal legal recourse, yet through a loophole, THEY, not ME as a driver determine the pay for services rendered, even though in almost any other sector, and any other case, the person performing the services sets their rates/does their billing.They completely exploited every aspect of the order-a-ride system, and they're still at a loss.Avoid at all costs.edit: (obviously, a minimal level of functionality is there. You can likely order an lyft while wasted, and end up home safely, or after going shopping, where you got the service you paid for, and are, as a customer happy with the service. That does not = a profitable businesses/potential investment for shareholders wanting a return. Personal experience aside, the aggregate, overall condition of the business is not good. Take it or leave it from a 6 year driver.)

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/amazon-amzn-q4-2021-earnings.html\n\nAmazon reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.\n\nEarnings per share: $27.75\nRevenue: $137.4 billion vs $137.6 billion expected, according to a Refinitiv survey of analysts\nAWS revenue: $17.37 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\nIt is not immediately clear if the reported earnings per share are comparable to analyst estimates.\n\nAmazon is wrapping up a rollercoaster earnings season for mega-cap tech companies. Netflix shares were hammered late last month after a weak subscriber outlook spooked investors. Upbeat earnings from Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet in recent days suggested the season could end on a high note, but then Facebook revealed stagnating user growth, which sent its shares plunging and dragged down other social media stocks.\n\nAmong the top tech companies, Amazon was the worst performer last year, with the stock rising just 2.4%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 13:39:09'] Same issues labeled by the previous Q. AWS is just a beast and will continue to be. Not really surprised they are increasing the price of prime. They need to draw profits from elsewhere and it seems they have enough people locked into their system that a price increase won't massively impact the amount of prime subscribers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 13:33:02'] It was a great quarter, especially on the AWS and advertising side.  Their ad business is the one I've been paying attention to, since it's been growing at double digits year over year, and ad margins are quite high
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 14:16:38'] This in my view is a mixed bag report. AWS is the big driver these days, and it continues to perform well with a modest beat on top and bottom line, but having a hard time seeing how this warrants a 15% pop.Retail is increasingly becoming a drag for the company, looks like mainly due to cost pressures. Margins on the retail side are getting worse and worse. Guidance is not great. It's not a terrible report, that's for sure, but I'd be shocked if we close tomorrow up 15%.

POST_TEXT: b'So im fairly new to investing and i was wondering how p/e and p/b can be used to determine which stocks to buy.\n\nAs far as i have gathered p/e mean price to earnings, where a high p/e indicates that the stocks are being sold for more than the companys actual surplus.\n\nAnd p/b i think is price to book and is used to determine a stocks price compared to the companys assets and liabilities??\n\nDont know if its correct, and if not i was hoping someone can correct me and also help me explain how to use these keywords.\n\nAlso how can i see a stocks p/e and p/b in real time? Is it only updated quarterly?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 01:29:04'] P/E, stock price divided by earnings per share per year. If you invest today how long will take to the company with current earnings to pay you back. That is why is crazy buy stocks with 150 PE like NVDIA event thought they can grow at 30% yoy during the next 5 or 6 years.It will take you 150 years to take you money back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 02:17:38'] On their own these metrics tell you nothing. A P/E of 2 in a failing business can be a "Wouldn't touch that with a 10 foot pole" moment whereas a P/E of 100 in a rapidly growing enterprise might be a steal.Metrics do NOT unburden you from still having to look at each company in turn: what they are doing, how they are moving in their environment, how the general market is developing for them, .... in order to figure out whether the they make a good investment or not.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 05:57:33'] Firstly, PE and PB don't "determine which stocks to buy". At best they should be seen as metrics to better understand how other market participants are valuing a stock.The way you might use PE and PB to help determine which stock to buy would be to compare your valuation with the market's. Eg, if you think paying 20x earnings (20 PE) for a company today is a fair price, but the market is valuing that same company at 15x earnings (15 PE) then it might suggest that it's underpriced – at least based on your analysis. But there is no simple rule like if a stock trades for 10 PE you should buy.PE and PB are also extremely fuzzy metrics. There are lots of reasons why a company might have very high or very low PE & PB without it being a reflection of mispricing. And for a lot of stocks PE and PB are basically useless.Your understanding of PE and PB is correct, but I suspect you're lacking the depth of understanding to use these metrics productively. I'm happy to try to answer any specific questions you might have, but keep in mind this stuff is really difficult and takes a long time to understand. Even when you've been doing this for years there are still things you learn all the time which can help you value companies better.However, if you're just looking to make a few casual investments you're generally fine to use PE as a sanity check. Eg, if you're buying a solid company and it's trading around a market PE then even if you're not getting the best deal, it's also unlikely you're making a massive mistake.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 08:01:03'] Pretty much. The trick is figuring out what is too low or too high. That said I tend to ignore PB on EPS positive stocks unless it's unusually low. I do look at PE but I prefer comparing it to forward PE. For example, lots of people might be avoiding buying a stock with a PE of 40 but it's forward PE is sat at 10. As for PB I really just use it on companies not turning a profit yet but growing well and try not to buy above book value. That's definitely not a science but you have to pick a price somehow.I use the app my stock portfolio (MSP) for checking out data and news quickly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 02:04:19'] Looking at just one key ratio can be deceiving and give the wrong picture of the company.All key ratios can be falsely presented, because of accounting practices.And they work best if you compare them for a more extended period, for example, have P/E in a bar chart for every year for the past 10 years usually works better then only looking at the current P/E.**P/E** = how many years with the current 1 year earnings will take you to get back what you paid for the stock.**P/B** = all assets, material, and non-material assets. 1 = the price of the stock equals all assets. Under 1 = you pay less and still get 1 worth of assets.I suggest you start looking into debt and revenue key ratios at least.If you are a company P/E is how much you saved this year. P/B is all things you have that are worth money like clothes, and cars but also immaterial assets such as education.Revenue is how much you are paid for work. And debt is...debt.Also, I prefer P/B-tang or NAV because they should only take the material book value into account. After all, immaterial assets (such as education) are very hard to set a value for.

Main drop was because of RIVN investment) while MSFT is all enterprise. If there’s one thing about enterprise is that they have long contracts and are insanely slow to change. Even if margins are bad on the cloud, Satya is a really strong leader and software is one aspect that can always improve
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 10:58:54'] Doesn't matter, MS Azure is solid.Nobody is using Google OS on server farms.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 16:26:22'] As someone who works professionally in all 3, I'd use gcp over azure any day..  the problem is, Microsoft spends much more on marketing and "partnerships" to encourage companies to go all in. Gcp has a good product, but they'll need to play the marketing game if they want to get ahead. Aws is the overall best, but they tend to borrow business ideas from cloud customers and start competing products. They don't even try very hard to keep it a secret.  Azure is so far behind in both documentation as well as their quality of support even if you have the fancy support levels with the low sla's
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 07:31:42'] 30% operating margin is kind far fetched.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 00:53:16'] Can’t disagree. Most Azure product groups are cost center’s bleeding money while only 4-5 Azure product groups/ services are profitable. >85% of Microsoft’s revenue comes from Office365 subscription/ EA’s and Windows (server and client OS) license sales. The remainder is a mix of services, patent licensing, royalties and ESOP clawbacks for staff who leave w/o vesting their allocated rewards.However they have a profitability target of 2027 for Azure as a business, so unless something cataclysmic happens which nixes this, they’re on track to hit that target.OTOH, Google Cloud needs to fail for them to learn that bad and sloppy product engineering teams with slow velocity and a cocky sakes org don’t make a good mix, and neither do the make for good customer acquisitions Seen this same thing in MSFT from 2006 to 2014.Fun fact- a Google employee ever, was never paid also by them -but wrote a full product and functionality spec for them in 2019-2020, which would have put them ahead of MS in 5 years had they executed without shifting goalposts all the time. But a lazy product leadership and PG teams are still going in circles. 🤷🏻
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 10:04:02'] Personal pov and experience and I’ve heard this from other developers - aws/gcp are better than azure.Google cloud is the leading AI platform and aws is first in best dressed.Azure from my experience although I am a .net fan is more buggy than my experience with google/aws. However I do see azure maybe becoming better but azure is preferred more because of Microsoft tech in business. Doesn’t get exactly translated into cashflows/investment partners though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 16:25:53'] I sold google stock after having to work with google cloud... IMO they are not going to win this race and it will not be close
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 17:54:04'] I sell Cloud Services with a focus on Microsoft. I also sell Google Workspace. I have so far never encountered a GCP deal. Not a single one in the past ten years. I have sold a good amount of Workspace but way more M365 and Azure. Comparing the partner programs of the two. Google is still trying to figure out channel, while Microsoft is trying to capture more from their channel and push out small players. Still though by far Microsoft has the best partner program. It isn’t even close. Google has a long way to go.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 06:59:01'] We tried Azure in 2017, and it was an expensive disaster. We lost dozens of drives for virtual machines. They just disappeared. I had four machines I tested with, and three just suddenly stopped working one morning. We tried again last month hoping they were less worse, and while they were better and lost less data, it was massively more expensive than AWS. We had to buy bigger vms because they are slower on Azure and more space because the Windows images from Microsoft are so bloated and have massive minimum sizes. Azure would cost us about six times as much. It’s ridiculously bad. Anyone investing in Microsoft for Azure is making a mistake.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 18:05:17'] If you’re really interested in just how far behind google is compared to AWS and AZURE.. look at their top customers. Azure dominates F500 & Government. AWS has key portions of F500, but lots of volume in mid&small market. Google has slim pickings, but mostly volume in small to mid-sizes businesses. Google is not close to second and this report is just to generate buzz for no real reason

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 14:05:34'] I still prefer to self host over azure. The exception being with smaller apps in large corporate/government environments as getting the admin team to get things right is often not worth it, but for large scale data intensive applications with tens of thousands of simultaneous users, I find the cost/performance ratio to be far more attractive for self hosting. I don’t know the overall market penetration vs potential and if it’s bullish based on forecast growth or if things have already saturated. The thing that gets me with azure and a lot of Microsoft’s stuff is that things like EntityFramework and Microsoft Identity often mask developers and even isolate them from the highly scalable underpinnings of RDBMS; combined with fast computing performance, often younger development teams find themselves against a performance wall to where the cloud investment in performance tiers unnecessarily gets scaled through the roof.

There is a 100% chance that businesses and software engineers and DevOps engineers get tired of “the cloud”. I already think Azure and AWS are kind of bullshit, like they will preach cost savings and better uptime and quick and simple management features but beyond DBaaS I see what I build as more difficult than it used to be with on-prem.Eventually companies will realize the Cloud is bullshit and Dell and HPE stock will be in vogue again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 05:12:31'] Having used gcp and aws extensively, with only a bit of casual experience using azure…I’m surprised google is in 3rd place. They should be lower, behind digitalocean and other lesser known hosts.Gcp is a horrible, expensive, difficult to use collection of 80% complete services - but which 80% is an exercise left to the reader. But not the reader of documentation, which largely claims it works as intended. No, you need to figure out which parts aren’t implemented yet by using the services, discovering something isn’t working, searching for it, and finding a 2 year old thread promising that specific thing you were going to depend on will be implemented soon. But no updates since then.I would never willingly choose gcp for any reason at this point. Aws is cheaper and easier to use. I’d be willing to believe azure is less frustrating, too, but I don’t have enough hands on experience to make that claim assertively.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 01:01:01'] It depends on whether J Pow will screw it up. As of Q4 2022, BAC had 31% securities portfolio (Treasuries, MBS etc). SIVB which just collapsed, had 57%. These were not marked to market, and instead values reported as "held to maturity" (HTM). You can check out Fed's own data on Assets and Liabilities of commercial banks. There has been significant increase in deposit outflow in Feb 2023, and bank's own borrowings (bank liabilities) has steadily increased in the past 6 months. This is not a good look. Forget about hiking interest rates, staying the same for "high and longer" will continue to cause massive deposit outflow from banks. You are at the mercy of an unhinged Fed if you own bank stocks. The Fed's actions for the past 2 months were wrong and excessive. J Pow's most recent testimony is highly destabilizing. Insiders within the financial elites knew this, yet just today so many "don't worry about it" and "no contagion" articles were being mass produced. Caveat emptor!

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 08:56:05'] Everything you said makes makes sense and is all technically sound, but 2 things that need to be said about Costco are:• Brand affinity & love: Costco has earned consumer trust through many years and deliberate strategy. This can’t be replicated (easily) and underpins all of its retention/stickiness/recurring membership model factors. Personally, it will be a cold day in hell before I cancel my membership and not spend hundreds there per month, and is the first place I shop for many consumer durables categories• Private Label success: Related to point above, they’ve excelled at their PL business with Kirkland that’s really strong reputation, quality and also they’re able to drive enough volume to be cost competitive too

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 09:29:21'] One thing untouched in your analysis, Costco’s business model has been attracting the best employees in retail since inception. With other retailers creeping up on Costco’s wages, this is no longer the case and Costco’s quality does diminish here. Managers at Costco also have had increasingly high turnover, so the best and the brightest are also not becoming managers internally. This may take years to play out, but it will no doubt have an effect on the company culture as a whole. Many companies have lost their way but continually rewarding the shareholders and squeezing their staff year over year has been Costco’s go to since going public.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 10:05:18'] Fantastic summary, though I will say I disagree on one point: I think technology WILL serve costco in the future. I work in robotics and spent years on automation for logistics and material movement. Automated fork trucks that can service high bay rack storage while operating in non-human exclusion zones are JUST starting to be launched in the market. With costscos healthy margin and cash reserves, in the next 1-3 years, I believe they will begin using these technologies which will bring down their operational costs of logistics by some degree, and significantly increase labor stability (as the skilled labor of a fork truck operator is becoming significantly more difficult to find, train and retain). Additionally, warehouse management software companies are starting to shift towards integration with autonomous mobbile robots, automated picking and transit systems, etc. Essentially there are three or four technologies that are going to be unlocked in the next 1-3 years, AND the centralized management systems for material movement and logistics are becoming more integrated.TLDR: the one thing I disagree about is Costco will not be served by new tech. Technology developments and advanced in material movement and logistics are coming to real widespread commercial applications in the next 1-5 years that will decrease costs and increase predictability, Costco is uniquely positioned to be served by this.

Not sure why Costco is allowing this, but it has made news and pissed off members.  Clark Howard, known personal finance guru radio host and lover of Costco, has talked about it a lot telling members to get another credit card.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 16:18:10'] Got this stock at it's all time fuckin high didn't I, got some more on the dip so it's not too bad
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 16:27:01'] Costco is one of my best performers, ive purchased shares from the $180-$300 price levels and still hold it today. Ive worked there for 12 years, although i recently stepped down to part-time to work it as a side job. Theres a few employees i know of who have retired early due to stock purchases and vested shares. My beef with the stock is that you pay a hefty premium for its assets that has been increasing over a long period of time relative to how much the business tangibly increases. It being expensive relative to the industry may be justified given its consistency and business model, but its at a point now where i wouldnt purchase more due to how the market values it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 15:16:43'] I do love Costco, I think it is actually a bad financial decision not to have a membership. They have the best price on many things, plus sticky services and amazing return policy that frankly lets me shop without second guessing a purchase.However, I think it is failing at appealing to single people, and the future generation.Whenever I have friends over, they gawk at the size of eggs or the industrial size of my BBQ sauce. Their eyes go wide when I tell them that my tire blow out was taken care of by prorating the wear and tear for a new one.But it comes down to this, my single friends do not salivate at the appeal. They don't want to "buy their clothes where they buy their groceries." They would rather pay at a Chevron than wait in a Costco gas line. Would rather have their products shipped via amazon or buy groceries at a hip store like Trader Joes rather than have to deal with hoard of families on a Sunday or food spoiling due to their enormous size.I think Costco has a great 20 - 40 years, but they need to start pivoting and I don't know if they can.

I do feel as more and more people get cautious with there spending and that this will effect Costco.If it dips below $300 I will be tempted to load up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 21:40:56'] Great write up. I do think you have maybe undersold. Walmart/Sams club. Now I know that most people who read that will be coming with pitchforks, so let me clarify. Costco usually beats Sams head to head on most products and thier stores are nicer. However Sams offers a lot of products costco doesn't and when your a plus member at sams you get free curbside deliver with the app, which costco doesnt offer at all. Also Sams is investing heavily in having self checkouts and app based checkouts. Site to store is a thing for Sams and you can order things off the website to be picked up in store. Costco really doesnt have anything like it. Thats said I see cashiers as faster and more efficient, but Sams has some benefits. You might pay a small amount more than costco for head to heads (think like 0.30 on a box of cereal) but in exchange you get a larger variety of products and sizes that are just not available at costco. I wouldn't drop my Sams membership anymore just cause a costco is in the area/came to the area(my prior policy). What I would ding Sams for is there store loc/environment (generally in worse areas than costco), costco does a great job at replicating thier exp at every store. Sams can vary quite a bit, and some of them are bad enough that I would drop Sams based on local stores. Anyway thats two cents from someone who does both.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 03:35:36'] Shopify seems like it was a lot of problems under the hood. Last year their ceo had this to say:“On July 26, 2022, Lütke announced immediate layoffs totalling roughly 10 percent of its workforce. In a message to employees, the CEO said the company's planning on growth rates continuing on the trajectory of the past two years "didn’t pay off" and forced the company to downsize.”This was followed by another round of major layoffs this month, totally 20% of its workforce. I imagine that huge expense reduction is helping the quarterly profitability numbers but it’s just hard to see why a company who has successfully deployed their software and brings in sizable revenue is bleeding so much money. The words from the ceo make it seem like the glided on Covid excitement for two years but didn’t build out anything too sustainable [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopify)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-15 13:46:47'] Look at it this way.>seems like I've committed financial suicide but others suggest I've gotten in at the perfect moment when thinking long term?If you aren't planning on selling any of your investments for about 10 years or so, yes. Keep on adding. It has to get bad before it gets good. Timing the market is borderline impossible, keep adding, do  not even check your portfolio. Eventually, it may not be this year, but eventually, I'd assume most of your holdings will rebound. The main problem is, at the moment, there's a lot of fear in the markets. People are worried about bank collapsing, inflation, stagnation, energy prices, food and more (depending on location), so until the fears subside, the market will go down.Don't try and time it, just set up an auto-buy, or lower your DCA amount, as long as you're NOT putting in more than you can afford to lose, you'll be fine in the long term. Not next week, or by May. LONG term. Think years ahead.

If you fancy yourself passive, that job is fairly simple. If you fancy yourself a gambler, that's a lot of TA, etc. etc. If you fancy yourself an long term investor, read Aswath Damodaran's work and watch his YouTube content.The idea of invested capital, is that it's your excess capital. What else would you do with the excess capital? You'd blow it, so at least you can risk it on an investment to grow into your future. And maybe it never does grow, but again, what else are you going to do with the capital?You shouldn't put up the down payment for something you need, it shouldn't be your emergency funds, your bill money, etc. What you invest should be money that if you did not invest, all it would do would sit there needlessly and have time erode it, and/or get wasted.Your decisions can not be made by another person. It's your money to profit or loose over the duration of your bet. You need to know why you're willing to risk it, and how you're willing to risk it. If you're doing anything beyond a passive bet on positive drift, get ready to make financial literacy and self directing your education towards that your life, at least for the next couple years.

Personal finance is honestly a formulaic road map where you don't start investing until you're in a stable position and have money after that to spare. "Stable" meaning you can pay all necessities (rent, bills, food, insurance, etc.), have no high interest debt, and have an emergency fund of 3-6 months of necessary expenses.saved up. Then you max out IRA and 401k. *Then* you begin investing in taxable accounts.You shouldn't be investing money you can't lose. Hating to lose is one thing, but being fucked if it happens is another. You also shouldn't be gambling your retirement funds. Until you're saving at least 15% for retirement just put it into "safe" ETFs, mutual funds, etc. not super volatile crypto and single stocks. After that you're spending fun money anyway. If you want to place a degenerate bet on the banking system after smoking a bowl instead of buying a new TV go for it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 16:03:53'] FSLY drives me nuts....-30% still hahaha. But fundamentally I still believe so let's hope it keeps going up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 15:58:26'] As long as it's not something that happens every month, it was obvious a 5% dip was out of order. FSLY then going up 10% is just how the market is right now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 15:42:59'] Sorry, I hit the wrong buttons and pulled the wrong lever.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 00:25:12'] I’m an amc but it makes me upset when people say the outage was a conspiracy by the hedgers like.. okay
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:57:28'] A service outage for a few hours typically would not affect stock. It is not a representation of ongoing operations (unless, if it is persistent). Many giant companies have had outages that took down huge percentages of online space and nothing happened.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 15:47:23'] I'd imagine a site crashing for not even a full business day wouldn't cause enough of a decrease in business for the stock prices to be negatively effected, but that's just my guess with no knowledge of the situation.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 20:27:30'] There are other companies that do the same thing.CloudFlare, Akamai, AWS, Google Cloud...I would say the smart move is to invest in the other ones... the ones that did not crash and that did not go up. Just saying.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 17:24:02'] I personally don't see why you think a dip is obvious,  Internet service providers have outages all the time and dealing with them is a part of being an internet based company, its an inconvenience, but it's one that should be anticipated
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 16:11:36'] To be honest I think it showed a lot of people how widespread fastly services are used - I was planning to invest but didn’t hit my buy value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 18:33:54'] Outage showed businesses and consumers how important FSLY is, and it no longer seems overpriced.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 05:09:18'] I’m struggling to see how it was “obvious” to reason a crash in stock was more likely? Shit happens in IT. An outage isn’t the same as having a massive data breach. Outages occur all the time, sometimes on a large scale - AWS and Azure are no exceptions. I think your last statement is probably along the lines of what I would be thinking - it’s now obvious how important they are to some large players.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 17:48:52'] Oh so that’s why it’s up 10 percent 🤦‍♂️
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 18:42:54'] It’s because citadel made a deal with Fastly…

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 18:32:21'] Amazon run their own servers. Any Amazon outage is unrelated to Fastly.Note also that Citadel (of naked short-selling fame, à la Reddit) are significant shareholders in Fastly.Whether Reddit's outage due to Fastly servers is related to Citadel's standoff against some Reddit groups is being speculated.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 18:53:30'] Citadel owns 500,000 shares...
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:37:57'] I can guarantee Amazon and Google don't use Fastly for their CDN. They have their own infrastructure.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:40:21'] Citadel owns a significant amount of it I read. Seems like hedge funds using it to censor Americans.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 02:44:44'] This event proved even further that Fastly has cornered this market... and should be priced like a monopoly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:00:51'] Just the fact that GME is about to moon and it almost took off today, but it is being heavily manipulated. We are about to own Wall Street. We are the hedge funds now !!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:34:27'] Some people think Fastly  intentionally crashed certain sites to prevent certain people from talking about a certain stock and If that is the case then that would mean they are in cahoots with whoever is shorting that stock who also happens to have money beyond your wildest dreams. They probably have a deal. Hypothetically of course
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 18:42:43'] You would think there would some one to look into this kinda thing..SEC
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 20:28:04'] Shitadel strikes again
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 21:46:34'] >I would say that the outage emphasised how important FSLY is to the every day running of dozens of the worlds largest websites.prime example of confirmation and explanation bias, trying to justify a seemingly random event.You might think a failure of service provider will cause their client to move away, not suddenly to increase their reliant on that same service provider.Why would the client stick to fastly if other competitor can provide more relibale services?there seems to be a lot of FSLY bagholder here.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 18:07:39'] Maybe someone at Fastly unplugged the servers on purpose?!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 17:07:24'] I am one of the guys who bought more.  Had 1000 shares and added 600 in the last month.  This stock will be 100+ by the end of next year - that's my best guess.  Covid drives everyone one to the "net" and FSLY is part of the fabric.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 16:35:28'] I think your guess is probably correct and we'll see some recovery in this stock finally.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 17:09:12'] The market isn’t rational and frankly hard to predict.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:35:22'] I have no expertise to offer. But as a software engineer, this kind of thing terrifies me.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:42:04'] The market has been backwards for over a year. Companies filing for bankruptcy result in stock doubling and companies getting hacked or going down result in people screaming buy buy buy
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:45:09'] Stock is down 38% ytd and it rallied a bit because of the premarket dip and that likely triggered some algorithm executions. People could also be impressed with the quick fix to the issue.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:46:12'] It was disappointing… I was hoping for a quick dip to pick up a few hundred more shares before it continues its rebound.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:47:12'] If their downtime affected the big companies that much, they’re important. That’d drive people to buy their stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 19:50:27'] Makes sense to me based on how this market has been this year
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 20:01:29'] Because it’s already reached it’s bottom
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 20:03:45'] Stock went up as market realized how central this one company is too the current status quo.CDNs control huge swaths of net traffic but are run by companies you've never/rarely heard about

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 20:43:54'] Growth stocks are on a tear, doesn't matter which, and FSLY was more off its highs than most
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 20:56:47'] This was purely momentum filling the gap from last earnings. It closed above $50 resistance yesterday and bulls took over. Text book technical analysis. It’s not all tea leaves.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 20:59:04'] It also also a lot of press for the name of the company (and any press is good press).  There are likely a lot of people that did not know or understand their role in providing.  I imagine a lot were new investors.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 01:50:59'] As a dev i am kind of not getting that. It has to serve more than CDN since a common pattern is to include local files if CDN is down
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 02:06:49'] Fastly is a very fast CDN for your average website, Amazon have a competing product called CloudFront but to their own admission, it's more suited to big chunks of data like video. This is why Amazon uses Fastly for it's website. They switched to cloudfront while the outage happened but I imagine they're back on fastly now.I invested in Cloudflare last year when the outage happened and a similar thing happened, knocked out most of the internet. Fastly looks like another one that the internet is dependent on and worth buying.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 02:10:29'] A huge stake of Fastly is owned by Citadel. Don’t forget about these manipulating fucks
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 02:17:18'] Haha wow, I had this exact conversation with a friend. So the 10% would probably account for retail investors only as the bigger investors knew this company already. At least that is what I think..
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 02:20:23'] It was probably trending on Twitter. No one actually read the tweets.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 02:51:43'] Internet outage will result in $25T in new infrastructure bill. Extremely bullish
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 03:00:44'] Bad news is good news?!? 🤷🏾‍♂️
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 03:02:58'] I’ve never seen a company stock shoot up after they caused a mess
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 03:12:41'] So bad news = Price up Good news = Rock bottom
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 03:43:32'] There is no bad publicity
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 04:05:33'] I never heard of the company „Fastly“ before the outage and how many websites it is driving. So yeah, the outage was good publicity.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 04:32:08'] Reddit has a ticker?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 04:57:01'] Fastly, Akamai, Cloudflare .. all these companies do similar things and if one of them goes down.. a third of the internet goes with them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 05:02:29'] It just showed how important they are and are a major player now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 05:03:01'] This seems like simply a combination of automated trading algorithms tracking media and social media mentions, plus name recognition making people aware of the company.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 05:06:36'] I mean they fixed it pretty qyick
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 05:13:56'] Citadel securities upped their stake in fastly
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 05:31:55'] I was looking for the dip also, and did not expect the bump up.  Fastly did identify and resolve  the problem rapidly and there web site communications were prompt and clear .This name is still on my buy list when a good entry presents itself.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 05:39:20'] Nobody is surprised that a CDN has an outage sometimes. That's just what happens when you work with so much interconnected technology.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 06:06:09'] What's the moat of fastly? All the major cloud platform provides have same products as fastly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 06:31:36'] I figured the same. People had no idea it existed and now realize the whole commercial internet seems to be dependent on it in varying degrees. How can a business have that much power? Scary.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 06:58:26'] Isn't it because Ciitadel bought a lot of their stock? I might be wrong though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 07:12:24'] A company that’s valued at 6bn is so critical it can crash some of the most trafficked sites on the internet? Maybe that valuation is a smidge conservative? Also, this is the first time they have had this type of outage AND it was resolved quickly and with transparency. Things break. It happens. It’s the company’s response that really matters.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 07:25:07'] So this is just an opinion but their time of recovery is somewhat impressive. To identify the issue and being able to remediate it in a timely fashion is pretty huge
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 07:51:04'] I don't know how to feel about that
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 08:13:16'] I was surprised because last time I checked their earnings I saw they only have a few hundred customers (albeit big ones) and growing this number very slowly. It sounds like it's not so much about Fastly but about some of the big cloud players using Fastly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 08:25:20'] After an outage the companies focus usually changes a bit to improving their infrastructure to avoid outages like this again. Depending on how the company handles their communication and their response to this outage, if it’s a positive response I’d definitely consider using their services
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 08:36:11'] I think a good indicator is also how quickly they responded to the problem and solved itAmazon, Google etc All had downtimes it's kind of fisiological in the industry, quality is measured in how you react to it
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 08:55:01'] people actually heard of them
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 09:46:24'] The past few months, I’ve seen great earning rpt and stock down and bad earnings, stock up!  To me and my opinion, is it’s just a sign of how corrupt and mismanaged the market is and will be, until we force change.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 09:47:48'] Just your quarterly reminder that FSLY is not enterprise ready.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 10:12:16'] Isn't there a certain "entity" that owns a decent amount of FSLY that need a lot of money quickly and like to manipulate stocks how they want? Hmmmmm
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 15:03:26'] I remember the same thing happend to cloudflare last summer. I guess when something like this happens people realize what these companies does

That’s not to say Google wouldn’t split but that’s the thought process behind not splitting. Keep trading volume normalized and separate from the major tomfoolery that goes on in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 05:54:05'] I don't think they will be splitting the shares, these stocks are very attractive to long term holders, and long term holders don't really mind the 4 digit stock price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 01:55:38'] I'd argue a benefit to keeping a stock price high is that more people are less likely trade options on the shares, thus making it less likely that options volume can affect a stocks price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 06:45:36'] Only if they were considered for the DOW. Look at AAPL. To be honest I don’t think Amazon or Google give a rats ass about a dumb index like the DOW. They are already a top 4 holding in most fund with AAPL MSFT GOOGL and AMZN with FB behind them. But as many say, why? $3,000-$4,000 isn’t actually that much. They don’t care about people buying in 1 share increments is probably the real answer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 09:26:14'] Everyone else has covered it.  Higher price means lower volatility.  People who buy it really want to hold it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 09:52:52'] I actually like the higher stock price… but if you can’t do it, find a broker that sells fractional shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 10:14:32'] They have never publicly came out and said why but the general consensus is that higher stock price means less day traders affecting the stock and options (need lots of 100 shares minimum) expiring won’t cause the stock to have massive volatility
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 11:08:07'] They like the higher share price since it generally helps keep hedge funds out of the stock since there are fewer shares traded making liquidity more of an impact. They can trade the same $ value in shares, but it can have more of price impact with a lower supply in the market.This was what I was told by the CFO and IR of a company with a $1,000+ share price
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 02:06:00'] If Amazon or Google want to get in the DOW Jones, they need to split their stock because DOW is weighted by **stock price** not market cap. Their stock price would be too big for the index atm.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 07:10:04'] Seeing how Apple, Tesla, and NVIDIA ran up from the split news, you want to be invested in Amazon & Google before the news, if it ever happens.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 07:09:21'] They don't want their stock traded and compensation is tied to their stock price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 08:37:28'] They don’t matter I kind of like the share price high it keeps traders away which come and go. It incentives more long term investors. That’s my guess why they don’t do it but that’s just me speculating.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 09:19:35'] Doubtful, it's that price to ward off fly by nighters and people not looking for a longer term position. Keeps the stock price more stable and not all over the place.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 11:30:34'] No, they don't need to and want to minimize the derivatives effect on short term pricing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 12:02:58'] Exclusivity insulates the stock from selling and options. But with partial shares I can counter anytime baby.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 09:41:41'] Bezos isn't running Amazon any more but still has considerable influence. He wants the stock to appear to be a luxury item, and fractional shares at brokerages are avoiding any controversy, so they probably won't consider it until he's dead.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 01:37:54'] In this current environment, with fractional shares available, I see no reason for either of them to do a stock split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 07:39:11'] With the ability to purchase fractional shares I don't think any company should bother with splits outside of reverse splits.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 08:17:27'] You probably saw Tesla split. Look up Berkshire Hathaway
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 03:35:16'] As an options scalper, I personally hope that they don't. I find it better to scalp OTM options in the $3-$7 range (I do this a lot on AMZN, TSLA, and MRNA) than to scalp OTM options on stocks like AAPL and NVDA now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 01:45:31'] Jeff bezos was personally opposed to it.  With hjm off the island, and Amazon in a consolidation pattern, there may come a point where Amazon splits.  But, clearly its not a major consideration for either stock
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 07:59:51'] With everyone getting in the fractional share train I doubt we see as many stocks splitting as we once did. There is no reason to do it now a days.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 09:26:30'] Like to most of these questions the answer is the same, nobody fking knows. I sure hope they do though, I'm invested in both and due to their high price they make up a large % of my portfolio that I'd like to diversify a tiny bit. Like if they did 1:5 then I'd sell like 1 from each per original share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 09:56:30'] The advantage of keeping the stock price high is that current investors are happy, they want their individual shares to be worth a lot of money and would be unhappy if it was worth half as much tomorrow.  You would typically split a stock in order to raise money.  Investors would all sort of agree it's best for the company to attract new investors and that the new money could be used to expand the business.  In the case of Google and Amazon... they have too much money.  They are constantly looking at things to throw their money at but there aren't enough investable opportunities for the companies to invest in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 15:53:57'] Unlikely, especially since fractional shares are popular now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-10 10:10:25'] the answer is yes
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 04:45:41'] Not too many peeps here going for a yolo with a stock that’s worth 3k. That being said, having held Amazon for a few years now, some sort of price move would be great. Goog is a slippery snake that I think will eventually pass Amazon in price if they don’t split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 05:25:06'] The advantage of a lower stock price is that it allows a broader base of investors. If you don’t have a lot of money to invest you are less likely to own stocks that cost thousands of dollars.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 09:24:55'] No because they all want it to be like Berkshire Hathaway.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 08:24:38'] Cmg shop goog amzn desperately need to split
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 14:37:15'] It’s also how they incentive the old guard employees. I believe they cap pay at 160k then after that it’s al stock. So as the stock keeps going up..employees stock goes up and they can borrow against their stock to purchase homes. (See how much a home goes for in Bellevue/Sammamish area…and 50% of the neighborhoods are amazon employees)
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 10:38:13'] It's just arrogance that keeps them from splitting, it's like Warren Buffett and Berkshine Hathaway. There is no good reason to keep their share prices so high.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-25 18:47:56'] Depend their long term strategy. If they need more cash then yeah they might split to attract more investors.On the other hand, if Tesla keep delivering,  hitting milestones and grow to $3K per share like what some bulls say then I can see Elon will split Tesla once more to get more cash for more Giga factories in EU, East EU, NA (US, Canada and Mexico) and South America cuz why not.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 14:12:07'] Speaking for my neck of the woods, Uber is just dominating. Eats and Advertising has allowed them to maintain cash flow. There are *way* more drivers on Uber than Lyft (I always check both). And subsequently the price on Lyft is way higher due to less supply of drivers available. I just think Lyft lost. Which I hope isn’t true because Uber needs competition. We have an entire generation of people that haven’t ever called a cab in their life, and probably won’t in the future. So I’m hoping Uber doesn’t get a monopoly on the space.

I think it's just another perk for Prime members who I'm sure will have big discounts at these stores. And also good advertisement and maybe even pickup shipping centers like they already do with WF, bestbuy, etc. Amazon's goal is making its Prime membership more and more appealing since Prime members are more loyal and spend more money on Amazon.

On one hand, I understand why they would do this as they have the infrastructure in place via fulfillment centers, warehouses, etc.However, the big thing they don't have going for them is the brick and mortar branding.

And then there's the people who just don't bother paying for Prime for whatever reason.Step 2:  Use all that money that you now have to build stores that are just as good if not better than any store out there. People with Amazon Prime will have the benefit of sticking in the ecosystem and getting more convenience (like after you see something inside the store, you can now add it to your online shopping cart in the future).  People without Prime will now have no excuse to get in the Amazon ecosystem.Step 3: Profit.

Every year every quarter is the same and nothing changes. The fact this stock is trading as high as where its at currently is nothing short of a miracle. The only direction I see them going to avoid this road of bankruptcy they are on is they need to be bought by another company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 01:52:10'] To be a successful social media company, you need to entice the big players. For example, when you see LeBron James social media accounts, no one ever says, "Follow him on SNAPCHAT." That's Snapchat's biggest issue: It's mainly a messaging social media service for teenagers and these teenagers have low buying power so fittingly, companies are going to pay SNAPCHAT much less than they would pay for the same ads on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc., Another issue is the entire app is just stupid and redundant. I don't see a 'company' behind SNAP. I just see an optional product that isn't going to change anyone's quality of life. If SNAPCHAT was gone tomorrow, those users will just move on to the next app. If Instagram was gone, you'll see a huge wave of people who will be begging for Instagram to be brought back. There's just no real brand behind SNAP.

POST_TEXT: b'Theres been a lot of news about tech layoffs in recent weeks, just thought Id collate some of the big ones and put some context in as well:\n\n- Google / Alphabet. Ended last year with about 188,000 employees. Announced cuts of 12,000 recently. Leaves them at 175,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\n- Microsoft. Ended last year with about 221,000 employees. Announced cuts of 10,000 recently. Leaves them at roughly 211,000. Comfortably more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\n- Facebook / Meta. Ended last year with about 87,000 employees. Announced cuts of 11,000 recently. Leaves them at 76,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\nSo my takeaways are:\n- The headlines of woah 10,000 jobs cut sound like a lot. And they obviously are and each of those jobs is a person who now is out of work, not minimising that. But in % terms theyre not that big a reduction when you see the context of how big these workforces are.\n\n- All these companies are still comfortably larg'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 22:15:18'] Tech layoffs mean they are improving their financial statements by reducing payroll expenses. The better convo should be focused on the possible change in income.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 18:17:22'] If these laid off people have trouble finding work in their field, then it will be an issue, but right now they seem to be getting snapped up by lower profile companies who have been trying to staff their IT teams forever.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 20:12:06'] They’ll rehire people into those positions over the next two years at much lower salaries. This isn’t about their bottom lines. It’s a play to get rid of employees who make too much and rehire those positions at lower wages.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 16:47:06'] More to come, agree with you, these are generally for headlines and not significant.  If I had 100 people screwing in a lightbulb and I let 5 go would I still have too many?I think JPOW is really after downsizing and/or killing/slowing the companies that were surviving on near-zero interest rate debt.   A lot changes when marginal companies can’t re-finance at zero again.  Then numbers and accounting actually matter.  Lenders won’t lend if they can’t reasonably be paid back.The macro problem with big tech is they can’t grow like they use to.  So no idea who the knew leaders will be.   Wish I knew.   Older investor and bearish perspective I have.Edit:  ultimately down to earnings.  Do we stay in the $220 range or is it the $200 range.  If $220 we may be priced right without much of any upside.   If priced wrong look out below.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 23:15:25'] At this point the layoffs will only add to the bottom line as same work, less people. I look around where I work and you could shed 10% and still have the same performance. Not sure about IT, but we use a lot of contractors or variable work force. Can anyone comment on the impact there?This is an easy reset of high cost labor environment, to a lower cast labor environment. Further another reason that will slow down raises, bonuses and expectations for compensation...again all going to the bottom line. In theory stocks should raise, and more profits should be made....as long revenue holds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 20:29:56'] Agree, the lay offs are small (relative to what they could be and relative to other things, like the freezing of hiring or pushing to cause some attrition). I think it's just a way for these companies to get a bounce in stock price by appeasing investors' calls for blood. There's also an element to leadership all copying each other. No CEO ever got fired for doing lay offs when everyone else is doing it. A lot of these companies could have caused similar attrition in quieter, less flashy ways. They want the lay offs to seem like a big deal.The actual bigger deal is the hiring freeze a lot of these companies have had since last year. No one is talking about the hiring these companies aren't doing. That's more significant headcount wise, I think, than the lay offs we've seen so far.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 16:13:28'] Earnings will dictate this ultimately, but I think layoffs like this are just good business practice when your workforce is so large. Like a forest fire clears out the dead shit for new growth, layoffs done properly create room for more productive employees.It could be that we'll have another round in 6 months, or none at all. My guess though is that the majority of these layoffs are not from revenue producing roles. It's good for the bottom line, and worth doing once in a while.

Most interesting thing is that I always saw more employees than customers inside the store. I guess people order online and the employees go around picking stuff up for them...

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 08:03:10'] The store has cashiers and that’s what most people use. I should know, I work here. But the store makes most it’s money from online orders not in store purchases
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 12:21:26'] Memes aside here, GameStop could actually do this. I mean, with the legacy it’s managed to build because of the legendary short-squeeze it could reinvent itself as a grocery store called GrainStop. I’d buy from there. Heck, they could start a gym called GainStop and I’d sign up just for the lolz.

It's ok but the aisles were not all the same size and the were just a bunch off Amazon order pickers filling orders.  The dash cart was cool but it makes no real sense for it to be open to the public.  Should just be a pick and pull Amazon orders store with pickup and delivery only.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 14:10:39'] I have one of these near a house I own (don't live in) and stopped by.Their produce and fruit prices often undercut other local supermarkets by a noticeable amount.  They also have a deli and pizza booths that sell what I believe to be at a loss as well.  A giant, full topping fresh pizza is only $8.99.They have the money to do what they always do - sell at a loss to build up incredible market share and starve out the competition.  It's anti-competitive, but how can you say 'no' as a consumer?They also called me and asked if I wanted to enroll in their home-delivery system after using their automated, sensing carts just a few times tied into my Amazon Account.  It seems like a very popular program, since most of the other "shoppers" were Amazon employees doing the shopping for online orders.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 12:19:24'] I've been wondering when this would finally come to fruition. If you think about it, the whole process of grocery shopping could be run by robots, especially the deli and bakery departments. The majority of the staff will be obsolete if somebody ever figures out the schematics of it all.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 12:47:40'] I live near one.  It's pretty cool the first few times.  The store has good prices compared to whole foods, it's like regular grocery market prices.  It always seems like there's more employees in the store than shoppers and it's probably because they are are filling online orders.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 13:06:49'] Honestly, I've been using Fresh for the last 5 or 6 months. Their own brands keep growing and improving and are cheaper than the grocery brands most of the time. Once in a while you're missing a bag, but they refund it without any trouble - I've been recommending it more and more as time goes on and it becomes normal to me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 13:20:31'] how profitable are grocery stores though? i was under the  impression that like restaurants, grocery stores were incredibly thin profit margins.the reason it makes sense for companies like walmart/target is because it's something that gets people in the store regularly, but amazon doesn't have those big physical (non-grocery) stores (and their tiny standalone book stores don't count for purposes of that statement).
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 15:43:56'] The Trader Joes by my house is a 10'K store and it seems like most of the other Trader Joe's i've ever been in are similar or close in size.  So if their smaller stores are 13'K then it's still competitive with bigger grocery.

Amazon didnt really invent it, more just bought it out and put their name on the 365 market idea. There are many 365 stores that have opened up and will most likely just be renamed to amazon fresh.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 15:03:05'] I would be more impressed with Amazon Fresh if they had done a better job with Whole Foods. Running retail grocery stores is a much different business than running warehouses with a delivery service. I have not been impressed with the selections offered through Amazon Fresh for delivery, and they fail to meet what I can find at Kroger or Publix just by walking in the door.  It might be easier for Walmart or Kroger to compete in the delivery category than for Amazon to compete in the retail grocery store business. Watch Kroger's delivery business; it has real potential to grow.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 15:23:42'] The draw of Walmart is more than low prices but also you need to factor in the entertainment or shock factor of going there. Pure circus sideshow entertainment on top of low prices.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 15:29:49'] There is one of these right near where I'm living (northern suburb of Chicago), that is on the verge of opening any day now. It's in a new shopping development, and has been in the stocking phase for a while now. NO news of it or its location anywhere on Amazon; even the local news reports don't list or say any information of which grocer might be opening there. Only thing giving it away are design elements on the building. Anyone else familiar with the location I'm taking about? Any news? For the record, the area where this store is opening is in real need of a grocer; closest large grocer is a Mariano's, who's quality and selection has gone WAY downhill since being sold to Kroger.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 19:38:31'] Honestly, I wish they'd still pay warehouse workers more, but the benefit of this is it may be able to service low-income communities without having to shut down due to margin costs effectively helping areas that are somewhat considered food deserts. I guess time will tell if they'll do good, but for now, I do have one up the street from me that I need to test out at some point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 19:56:28'] This is interesting information, but I don't really see that it actually means a whole lot from an investment standpoint.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-12 01:01:02'] To give y'all an idea of what it's like in one, they converted a Whole Foods near me into an Amazon Fresh. Has the same atmosphere as a Whole Foods, but at competitive grocery prices. There are plenty of workers on the floor fulfilling orders to be delivered and picked up. They offer 2hr same day delivery FREE to prime members.  There are regular checkouts, but I like using their contactless checkout using these tech carts with built in sensors, cameras, a tablet, and scale. You scan in your Amazon account on your phone. As you add items to the cart, the sensors and cameras detect the items and add it to your grocery list on the tablet. Taking things out of the cart queues a prompt on the tablet asking if you're putting it back. Easy. Scales in the cart also pickup weighted items like produce. Once you're ready to checkout, you go to the designated checkout lane for these carts, which queues the tablet to total your items, you review the items, then checkout and it's billed to your Amazon account. Downsides, the cart is heavy because of all the tech, there's only room for two paper bags that they supply, and you can't leave with the cart so you carry your bags from the store to your car. But I love the tech, it's pretty cool.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/amazon-ad-revenue-now-twice-as-big-as-snap-twitter-roku-and-pinterest-combined.html\n\nThe major growth in Amazon\'s advertising unit means its revenue contribution is now 2.4 times larger than Snap, Twitter, Roku and Pinterest combined, and it\'s growing 1.7 times as quickly, according to Loop Capital. \n\nAmazon\'s "Other" unit, which is primarily made up of advertising but also includes sales related to other service offerings, grew revenue a massive 77% year-over-year to more than $6.9 billion in the first quarter, the company reported last month.\n\nThis is another bright spot of amazon stock. Ad revenue is highly profitable like AWS, so it could use the profit to support other business. The ad revenue is growing very fast so it could able to compete with FB and Googl in the future. The stock is trading under $3300, investors should consider buying some and hold.\n\nThanks for the awards.'

They want an impulse buy or some oddly specific item and they want it at their house same day or in 2 days flat. Unless somebody can top them, they will be king and their stock is a buy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 05:28:52'] Again the economy showed its relative strength. Frequent rate hikes since March of last year were supposed to create a recession, but so far that didn’t happen, and may not happen. However, some weakness is expected. The markets probably will move sideways for the next few months. Will the Fed start rate cut on September? It is unlikely we will see any rate cut this year, given the stubborn high inflation which is much higher than the Fed’s target of 2%.

For example, San Jose is 40% while Austin is 60%.\n\nIm surprised there arent acquisition talks at this level.  This reminds me of the retail sentiment when people thought Amazon would take over the world.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:19:05'] "Only thing is work from home." That's kind of a very big fucking deal. Offices arent used, employees are happier working from home, office leases lapse with no new buyers in sight. The industry is absolutely dying, if you want a growth industry invest in whatever is going to be renovating those places and putting them back to use.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:56:09'] You've answered your own question here. 99% occupancy down to 60%. There is little pricing power for the owners of these units, unless things drastically change.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 17:09:01'] UNH just let it’s lease expire on its headquarters. IT’s headquarters! Things may start to get bad for office rental. Also how much will this effect the company’s bottom line. If it’s highly profitable, will other companies need to follow suit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:19:18'] what positives do you see in the sector in the future?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:41:15'] The problem they have is that any lease renewals over the next several years are likely to be at much lower rents due to the high levels of vacancy.  The working assumption is that, coupled with continue high vacancy rates, will further drive down NOI which will force REITs to cut dividend payouts.  Since REITs are generally viewed as income vehicles and trade on the basis of yield, that puts pressure on stock prices. For various reasons, the private markets don’t always react the same was as the more liquid public market.  Sometimes they are right, sometimes they are wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 17:33:24'] bank offices close down.  office space is no longer rented.  office reits lose income.  office reit share price takes a dive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 23:54:47'] REITS are an inverse of interest rates.  You acquire a bunch of property, and when interest rates are low and occupancy is high, you make bank.  When occupancy falls and interest rates increase, they're generally loss making.  They provide a constant steady return when interest rates are low, and the appeal is that a REIT might deliver 4.3% dividends while rates are 1-0%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 17:49:44'] I think it's justified.From what I've seen in my European country many white-collar companies are being smart and embracing WFH-culture. They are down-sizing and cutting out unnecessary leases.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 17:14:24'] Looks like you answered your own question. Work from home is a huge hit and will likely remain a large factor, reducing much of their negotiating leverage when lease renewals come up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 19:53:35'] There is a huge separation between top of market assets vs middle of the road. The best properties are performing well while the others are struggling. Private markets haven’t had enough trades to determine value or stability so the cap rate game is very unreliable at the moment given the first statement. 60% occupancy likely struggles covering debt service (which is why large landlords are giving keys back to lenders). Office properties tend to have lower leverage than other asset classes (think 55-60% LTV and some REITs use even lower leverage) so just do the math on how that occupancy affects cash flow/value. Anyone that has debt coming due soon won’t be able to refi in this financing market. This should create fire sales and even further value declines. There could be some good value somewhere just needs to be the tippy toppy propies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 00:43:39'] Even cap rate stay the same, higher interest rate means the return is less attractive. Also some REITs have high debt ratio, and would take a big hit from higher interest payments.Many people are assuming vacancy rate to continue go up for the next few years too, which leads to lower revenue in the future.It is possible some bad REITs will went down , and some got buyout in next 1 or 2 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 00:49:31'] I own some of those companies listed. They've always taken a beating during recessions and bounce back higher. Hopefully that continues to be the case.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 02:47:47'] Big part of it is just interest rates.Real estate returns are not that great in general, usually below 5%, if you exclude speculative investments.This kind of return was great with interest close to zero, but now that you can the same with less risk by just investing in bonds it's not that attractive anymore, so the prices reflect that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 19:36:30'] You're forgetting something..  Not a single one of these companies likes fucking landlords either lol.   If you can cut costs, you will.

That is huge. Yes leases are currently active, but given that demand is going down - it means that the next round of negotiations the tenants have more power. >I’m surprised there aren’t acquisition talks at this level.Why should you buy an asset that you are not sure can sustain itself in 2-3 years when the next negotian rounds for the tenants begin.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 05:29:58'] I worked briefly in this realm and here's my take:Creators make money 3 ways:*Ad revenues (youtube) and subscriptions*Brand partnerships*Merchandise Of those three categories, the only ones that have a significant stake in the creator economy is Meta/Snap and companies who rely on #1, the content, to generate ad sales. Nike and Adidas aren't going under suddenly if the creator economy slows.Look for companies who provide ancillary services to creators as a large % of their business operations. There aren't any out there I'm aware of that are publicly traded though, so good luck there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 05:08:56'] I don’t think it’s that simple. Not a fan of influencers by any means, but they are content creators.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 23:50:26'] They will just change business modell. So if they cant generate ad revenue they will make it ad free as subscription model and the consumers have to pay to watch the content. The creators will always continue to do content, even if they cant earn money (some might stop  sure).
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 05:39:57'] Doesn’t seem oversaturated at all
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 06:42:10'] Thats your feeling or do you have some kind of data? I am from the field and influencers and especially micro influencers are generating tons of orders for ecomms. I dont even know how possibly can content creation end. Are you talking about end of internet entertainment industry? Or who will create all that content? It is like you say that celebrities and movie stars are out of the trend. This thing will never die just new influencers will come
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 06:54:17'] Lot of content going to be coming from or co-created by ChatGPT style models. It’s a massive disruption for content creators and it will mean new form of platforms will take precedence but I don’t think it will happen as a big bang either. Generative AI is going to cause massive jolts because if you think anyone with a phone can record and produce the content wait until AI will give 10 versions to the podcaster lol I think if you are creative and have basic market awareness it would be fine. There always going to be consumers if you have interesting content.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 09:20:01'] Whatever expensive and trendy equipment they use to make videos and look good in them. Saw a ring light with stand at the dollar store for 4.50. And really good looking yoga pants on Amazon for 19 bucks. On a slight, and more macro tangent, I saw one influencer couple document selling their California home and moving to a Midwest mansion with less cash. Not sure how useful that is but damn eh.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 12:36:15'] I think of it like this. These influencers are marketing products to, basically their peers. Kids their age trust them. It’s better than anything, because people tend to trust their peers more than a rich celebrity. Influencers come across as normal everyday people. When these normal people get to Kardashian levels of stardom, their audience just grows and their base has been built. It’s not going away anytime soon.

I like municipal and short term treasury bond funds. I also like a variety of close ended funds with yields of 5-7%. Bond funds are trading at 10-20 year lows. The entry point into these is fantastic as most of the downside has already occurred. Will also allocate about 40% of my portfolio to growth funds like VTV, SLY, SCHD, and VYM.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 01:59:13'] Everything I’m hearing is 2023 will favor those who pick individual stocks, not etfs. Going back to old school deep dive research on each company is the projected winning approach. Remember- Wall Street doesn’t make any money on investors buying and selling individual stocks- they make money on etfs and mutual funds. Mom and pop buyers of s&p funds plus institutional buyers of etfs results in heavy tech concentration and that isn’t going to do well right away. You can be bold like Cathy Wood who bought TSLA a day ago but I’d say oil and some minerals for EV cars, like lithium cobalt etc could do very well this year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 07:15:02'] The defined outcome strategies I've been using since the beginning of this market downturn are particularly geared towards wealth preservation and reducing risk. It's generally a good idea for investors to have a diverse portfolio, regardless of their age. However, the specific mix of investments that is appropriate for you will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:\- If you are in your 20s or 30s: You have a long time horizon, which means you can afford to take on more risk. It may be a good idea to allocate a higher portion of your portfolio to stocks, which have the potential to generate higher returns over the long term, but also come with more volatility.\- If you are in your 40s or 50s: You may be nearing retirement or have other near-term financial goals, so it may be a good idea to start thinking about preserving your wealth. You may want to consider reducing your exposure to stocks and increasing your allocation to more stable investments, such as bonds.\- If you are over 60: You may be in retirement or approaching it, so preserving your wealth and generating income will likely be your top priorities. It may be a good idea to allocate a larger portion of your portfolio to less risky investments, such as bonds and cash.Keep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and every investor's situation is unique. It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional to determine an investment strategy that is appropriate for you (vs all the 'experts' on Reddit).
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 12:16:51'] Buy low, sell high.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 11:36:22'] Well I collected money in all of 22, from crypto profits (late 21) csgo skins and just normal income, and I waited as I expected lower prices and also as I think the common approach of being fixated on prices is one huge mistake, as I mostly look at time and environment. So what I mean is that if I build my model, my goals (longterm for example), my risk tolerance, my future planned income and expenses , stuff like that, + x amount of uncertain things I come to a certain conclusion and plan based of that.So that concludes to me starting my buys here (I bought a tiny fraction on Dec 28th), I basically do a simple "split" and have my scenarios, I expect good buying opportunities for the future here in 23, but I am also ready to benefit from unexpected outcomes like: It drops a bit more than I expect (which longterm benefits me more anyways), it just chops around for more months even years ( prob the overall worst situation for most guys, no major new ATH or lows, so a lot of +- and patience and patience = time which is the most valuable thing we have , or if it would turn and just go nuts from here, which means I won´t chase the pump, but the part I invested will be making me money so it´s a win as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 14:00:37'] In retrospect, does anyone actually think DCA was a terrible strategy in a bear market? I’m actually glad I didn’t buy put that much money into DCA in 2022. Yeah my portfolio might look pretty right now, but at least I didn’t catch a fucking falling knive. Even if the market does bottom and start going back up, I would still be in a better position to start DCA.Like why DCA when the market has more room to fall, and not waiting for more certainty in the market and then DCA after?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 06:44:08'] HOG - Harley-Davidson reported interesting numbers in that their shipments are up as a whole across 2022 from 2021... but behind the curtain we see the real truth. The reason for my post is that motorcycles are a luxury item for most and Harley is one of the most expensive based on cost of entry.     Inventory at dealers rose by thirteen thousand units from the same time in 2021 after they had spent years trying to knock down those numbers. Sales in the US are down nearly nine thousand units. HDFS, their financial services arm, set aside 51m in Q4 for losses which brought 2022 up to 145m in total.  For a brand whose point of entry is over sixteen thousand and typically is in the high twenty thousand range these are continuing to be not good signs. Sales is not be helped by the fact they are continuing their supply chain surcharge which is a thousand or more on their most popular units.  https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news/news-details/2023/Harley-Davidson-Delivers-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results-Successfully-Completing-Second-Year-of-Hardwire-Strategic-Plan/default.aspx   https://s201.q4cdn.com/697889289/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/HOG-Q4-YE-2022-Earnings-Slides-2.02.23-FINAL.pdf      I have no position in their stock, I am just a former owner of their motorcycles and likely a future customer should they choose to remove the surcharge. Dealers are going to be struggling this year and seeing sales decline in the US yet again while inventories are up will put pressure on the dealer network even more.   Oh, on top of all that they will be importing a motorcycle (X350) designed and built in China with only their emblem added to the bike for their riding academy. Harley is no longer able to economically produce bikes they can use for their own riding academy

If you examine these stocks did not grow. One online delivery stock stayed flat for over a year now. To bet the others are better is a sluggish year where value stocks are preferred.I know several experienced investors hold 200-500 different stocks and funds and manage themselves without spending much of their time.  Actually most stocks operate  independently unless there is maintenance involved.  Most spend 30 minutes a day with a respectful returns.Should you get tired you can own indices. For examble, if you possess BRK.B or BRK.A for this year it performs better than S&P 500 this year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 18:32:00'] “How are we not in a recession”?Well - we have had positive GDP growth in Q3 and 4, and record low unemployment.  That’s how.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 06:47:54'] It seems to me there’s a strong misunderstanding of what a ‘recession’ really is and what it means for the average person. In simple terms, a recession is a decline in economic activity (GDP), period. It has nothing to do with inflation, and it has nothing to do with the stock market. Obviously there is some correlation between those, as markets *usually* decline during a recession. Recessions can also vary drastically in severity. There’s been many recessions over the last century and most people probably didn’t notice some of them. If your job is stable and you’re not heavily invested in the stock market, does a recession really impact you much directly? Not really. I do not understand all the doom and gloom hype over an impending recession. It’s a normal part of the economic cycle, if one doesn’t come in the next year or two we’ll surely see another on eventually. Stop worrying about it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 07:13:28'] Look at the chart of M2 money supply.  Sure, it's declining now, but we're still far above where the trend line would be without fiscal and monetary stimulus (max was ~18% above trend, currently ~10% above). I.e. there's still a lot of easy money sloshing around and propping up earnings and asset valuations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 08:06:01'] Consumer are still pretty flush with cash. 30-60 day past due accounts are picking up but not substantially.

In Q3 and Q4 2022, wages rose faster than inflation. Source: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiCp-etnIv9AhVAkokEHYP1DfoQFnoECBAQBg&usg=AOvVaw1JwUL3jU3Cb9xJYkSjBAUx2. Job layoffs are isolated to relatively small industries. Here's a quote from the Wallstreet journal: "Employers in healthcare, education, leisure and hospitality and other services such as dry cleaning and automotive repair account for about 36% of all private-sector payrolls. Together, those service industries added 1.19 million jobs over the past six months... By comparison, the tech-heavy information sector, which shed jobs for two straight months, makes up 2% of all private-sector jobs."

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 06:00:44'] There's more money going to the bottom, and it's filtering up, mainly because the top down economic model is bollox, when companies get more money they don't pay their employees more, they pay their shareholders and ceos more. When the bottom has money the companies get it anyway because the bottom simply can't afford to stockpile cash like the top does.

Motivates people to buy things they don’t need and then pay interest on it so bank can reap the benefits.It’s also forced in US due to maintaining lame FICO / Credit score.

But it's currently low and the Labor market is too tight because companies are warehousing talent.Until the Fed truly cracks the labor market, they will keep rates higher for longer, which will give us a deep recession.

Even with wages up as much as they are, you cannot sustain that. The investment money for housing is cooling the fuck down. When you can borrow at 3% vs 6% that’s a big deal on your rental margin. Especially when risk/reward ratio of putting money in cash or treasuries that’s guaranteed risk free. Any borrowed loans are in for some fleshing out. This takes time. In the trillions of dollars. They don’t move in a year. Stocks are holding up from quality names with quality growth. The industrial base in the USA is set to expand dramatically. With other things going on in the world. China not doing well and a decoupling bit by bit. Russia. European investment in trouble. Etc etc. This boosts capital flows more into the US.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 20:31:04'] You stated the problem, you saw it coming, and if you saw it coming so did many others. That's why it was on the news and web daily, looming recession any day now. Big banks, the market makers, hedge funds, retail, etc. all prepared for the worst. At this point the market is well prepped for the looming downturn in the economy.  That doesn't bode well for a difficult recession if one does hit. The other problem lies in that there is still a backlog of product in manufacturing. Lead times are still long to get parts, etc. Companies are mostly doing well in their earnings and profits are flowing in. Tech companies are laying off you say, they also added 1,000's of jobs during COVID. The boom they saw in business was not sustainable. They must cycle down on head count. There is also a strong correlation to cutting jobs and the stock market looking at that move positively.  There is also no other catalyst like a housing crash, banks going under, etc. We could have a recession, the market is modestly prepared and it won't be 1987, 2001, or 2008.

College loans starting up again will have a delay - those affected who can’t afford it, it takes time for accounts to go delinquent and such.  Months even. 2.  A lot of people are affected, but are still managing to make payments but are on the edge of declaring bankruptcy and hoping nothing goes wrong between now and end of year.  3.  Interest rate changes require the market to shift into the higher rates for them to have a major impact.  A lot of people are still buying homes, so this will take time.  Seattle market has seen a 100-150k drop in housing prices.  If you just bought your house, and you lose your job you may now have a house worth less than what you owe so you can’t sell it to get out of it.  This all takes time to happen.4.  Tech jobs -  many have lucrative severance packages.  Wait for a couple months.  I was recently laid off got 3 months pay.  I’m searching hoping to find something but it’s tough right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 19:36:03'] I’d suggest DCA investing in index funds until you understand how to pick stocks. Stick picking is not as simple as buying the stock of a brand you enjoy. It means valuing a company, analyzing financial statements, studying fundamentals, etc. Until you have a strong understanding of stock picking, I’d avoid individual stocks. That said, if you really want to study how to pick stocks, read The Intelligent Investor; it’s a fantastic book that should I still a healthy mindset in you. Study the styles of successful investors such as Buffett, Graham, Lynch, Greenblatt, Munger, and so on. Find a strategy that works for you and stick with it. People like to claim it’s impossible to beat the market, but all the people I mentioned above demolished the index over many years. Research shows which strategies work and which don’t. Rather than reinvent the wheel, implement strategies that have a proven track record of performing well (preferably outperforming indices) and providing a safety of principal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 20:20:31'] Investing is the business of dreams. Nobody wants to own x shares of blank, people just want to get rich so they can live their dream life. With that being said, your first investment should be yourself. Grind down any debt with a bad rate, invest in your education and skills, and lastly establish a 6-15 month emergency fund. Once that is done I recommend your first $15-20K go into a S&P 500 index (ticker VOO or SPY). This will give you exposure to the top 500 American companies. I have my entire 401K in VFIAX which is a similar fund through Vanguard. Now comes the fun part. You have skills giving you income and you have a little bite of every delicious apple on the money tree. Now is where you differentiate. Create an investing thesis. That is something you think will drive growth for years to come. I recommend something in your field of expertise, but it doesn’t have to be. Once you established a thesis, go through the stocks that are doing business adjacent to that thesis. Look at what they are priced at (P/E), market cap, free cash flow, revenue, net profit, insider buys/sells, general trends/sentiment, investor ratings, and I could go on. Try to find stocks that fit your appetite for risk, and match your temperament. I was buying GameStop at $7-16/share. But I wasn’t emotionally ready to sell when it peaked at over $400/share. I ended up selling around $60, over 4x my money, but I could have had so much more. You have to learn from your mistakes. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 01:22:46'] I have been a Schwab customer for over 35 years. Great company with great representatives and excellent free research tools. I suggest you buy a Schwab mutual fund or ETF tied to the S&P 500. That way you will have a nicely diversified holding that tracks the major companies in America. After you learn how to research individual stocks and decide what kind of investor you want to be, ie. Growth oriented, value oriented, both, etc., you can start adding individual companies to your portfolio. Investing can be rewarding and educational as well as fun as long as you understand there will never be guarantees with your purchases. While it is not gambling, there is risk. Doing research and carefully choosing your companies will minimize that risk. The key is to keep adding to your portfolio on a regualr and consistent basis no matter what the market is doing. That is called dollar cost averaging. Hope this helps, getting started can be overwhelming. Mark

I can DM you who I follow if you like.  Search You Tube, talk to some financial advisors near where you live, read some articles, etcI, personally, would buy XYLD and use the dividend to purchase additional shares each month.  It's dividend is currently at 13% (If I could go back and invest $50-$100 per check)Next, I would learn how to sell covered calls, and paper trade stocks like TSLA, AAPL, META, GOOG.  In about a year or two you will have a good Idea on how the process works and how you can make money if the stock is going up, going down, or sideways.  I don't believe the stock market outpaces inflation and taxes, so my strategy may be very different than your thinking.Here is some good advice I received, through various learning sources, over the past year:\- Don't trust any advice or advisor.  Take in what they say, learn how to do a fundamental analysis of a company for it's future cash flow, and make your own decision.  You are the one taking all the risk\- There isn't a big pool of money waiting for you to get your portion.  A very large number of companies will fail each year, and a large number of companies cannot outpace inflation and taxes.  learn how to be market neutral.\- if you aren't willing to put in a lot of time understanding the market and companies, you will most likely fail.  May get lucky from time to time, but over the long term, doomed.  If you don't want to put in the time, stick to what makes you money and focus on that.  Learn to save, and find a financial advisor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 19:13:32'] dont just blindly buy amazon or apple or google or even VOO or VTI as people here are saying. Learn how ETFs work first before you buy one so you know about how the indexes move the market before you buy some of these bigger companies. Learn to look at valuations and ask yourself a simple question: Why am I investing? Are you wanting additional income stream, multiply your money, insulate yourself until retirement from inflation, make a living on it, or all of the above? If you let us know what you want, people can maybe point you in the right direction. Some of those things are harder than others but at least you can know what kind of strategies people employ. ex: People who tell you to just buy VOO or VTI are not doing you a favor if you want additional income streams.Personally, the biggest companies and even monopolies will always be unable to hold their edge into perpetuity. Just look at the East India Trading company or the railroads of the past. Therefore, google, microsoft, amazon etc aren’t great investments to me bc they will neither give me stable dividends, 2-3x my money, nor are they guaranteed to stay as mega corporations until I retire. I would rather focus on speculation and dividend generation. But I know that is an unpopular take here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 15:44:19'] I don’t think we are in a dip. Imho valuations are very high (too high), they’re still 20-25% above historic norms. People had to pile into equities because there wasn’t any money to be made in fixed income for the last 15 years and now that has changed. A person nearing retirement can get the 4% they need with CDs and doesn’t need to be or want to be in equities.Valuations are too high still - the market wants to run but smart money should be in short term bonds and CDs imho

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 21:26:25'] Okay this is how I see it and a lot of young people don’t agree but I do. When you’re young you can take more risk cause you’re young and have time. If you’re older, you want to be safe and buy the spy or qqq cause it’s a really safe equity. If you’re making that little amount of money, no offense, but that’s not really going to compound or do anything sognificant to help reach financial freedom. This is what young people don’t get. They’re investing 1200 a year for 5 years.. that’s only 5-6k. One bad accident happens and you have to tap into that bag and now you’re back to 0…Imagine if you had taken risk and bet $1000 or even more on one bet, and it pays of 100x an snow you have 100k. Compared to the 100 a month into a low yield low risk asset. Yeah, that’s okay if you have a million dollars. Most millionaires and billionaires do that. They buy low risk (or even no risk stuff like bonds) which yield 2-3-4% and they’re happy with that. Cause they’re so rich. But you’re not rich my friend. You can be if you make the right financial decisions. Don’t do what all the young people do and not really take risk. Right now there’s a lot of opportunities. Just be patient and know that it won’t happen in a day. Must be patient. That’s the most important thing in investments. There’s some people that have been doing this for a very long time. They know patience. Young people don’t and blow up their accounts cause they want to get rich tomorrow. No. That’s not how investing works. Then they say everything is a scam and capitalism is a scam. No. That person was just foolish. Don’t be foolish like the majority of young people, and don’t buy $100 of a etf every month, cause you’re not investing millions of dollars. When you have millions of dollars or even a good paying salary, okay start, but right now with your lower wage job, research hot sectors, ask people that seem like they have insider info, and speculate into a company with a lot of potential. Like Tesla 10 years ago. Or Amazon 20 yrs ago. Or apple. Or Bitcoin 10 years ago. Those all 1000x +

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 08:54:08'] I agree with the recommendation many are making of VOO. although I'd if if you want to add a very slight amount of added volatility for a fair chance at slightly better returns, you might split your money between VOO and VTI. VOO just invests in the top 500 companies by market cap, while VTI includes small- and mid-cap companies, which many people think are going to over-perform in the next year or so. But VTI is still a broad ETF and brings the protections against major loss relative to picking individual stocks like VOO does.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 11:46:14'] Given the rising interest rates, Amazon’s slower growth in 2021, I think Amazon is only a bit oversold compared to the Market, but comes with a bit more risk as it needs to keep fairly high growth. So, yea it’s a fair value…. That said I think the market is due for a correction as it seems the fed is going to get more aggressive,the market by my math is overpriced 14%, and the same math says Amazon should trade flat. If it’s a buy and hold forever it’s about as good a place to put your money as any right now.Obvi, my math means nothing, but it’s how i sanity check pricing and get relative info, actual hard numbers are meaningless and my assumptions can be (and probably are) entirely off.

Then last year everyone and their mother forecasted $4k-$4500.  It got to about $3800 in July, then sank like a rock, and hasn’t recovered since.  There were 4-5 times throughout the year it would get to $3500-$3600, then back down to $3300-$3200.  If $5k, or near that, was inevitable, everyone would be buying it.

VIAC, a massively growing streamer that's just getting started, sells at 6x earnings. Re VIAC, Market is skeeeeeeered that nobody will ever watch a film, broadcast TV or cable again and what if nobody streams either plus Market feels bloated and 20 lbs overweight and everyone I mean everyone hates film, broadcasting, cable and streaming. YOLO VIAC. Sell VIAC at 20x. Meanwhile, who knows what happens to AMZN. If all goes well, buy AMZN at 20x for AWS. Can't happen? It's happened before.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-06 22:27:50'] I'm not particularly bullish on Amazon right now, due to concerns about their new CEO and their diworsification, but I used to be. For the sake of debate a few bullish arguments could be:1. Amazon has a history of aggressive re-investment, which artificially inflates their P/E but has proven great for their long-term growth. They used to have a P/E in the thousands, and for quite a while had only negative earnings. They've been investing a lot into infrastructure recently, which may bear fruit over the next few years.2. Amazon has AWS, widely acknowledged to be a powerhouse in cloud computing, and growing. It might deserve a trillion-dollar market cap just on its own. Cloud computing may very well define the next decade.3. Although their e-commerce arm is not particularly profitable, the plan seems to be to leverage it for digital ads--which have shown to be insanely profitable when pulled off correctly.  They've only just started this.4. Amazon has a track record (admittedly, under different leadership) of successfully moving into new markets. Who knows where they'll go next, but I'd hate to be in any market that gets in their crosshairs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-06 22:36:02'] I would not buy Amazon because I'm happy with the exposure I get through VOO but I am bullish on the company.  I see Amazon emerging as the undisputed heavy weight champ of streaming.  Not only do they make great content but they also had the foresight to create a means to deliver other content via their channels.  Why sub to 10 different streaming services when you can get them all through Amazon?  And that's only part of it.  AWS is killer.  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) is killer.  When it comes to long-term buy and hold I put more weight on where I think the company will be in 10 years vs current fundamentals.  I don't see AMZN as any kind of "quick buck".  I like GOOG more but AMZN is a close second.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-06 22:59:49'] The PE ratio is misleading because it includes artificial losses from investments in things like RIVN going down in value.If you removed the artificial loss in the value of RIVN on their earnings that increases their profit $7.6 billion. Inflation is still high, which means their debt will be worth less as revenue increases (even without sales growth as items will increase in price), increasing free cash flow. The debt they do have is mostly long term and at a fixed rate, so raising interest rates are not a concern. People who use AMZN will still use AMZN, as it sells many basically necessities that people won’t be cutting back on, plus the business that are customers of AWS will still need internet infrastructure.If AMZN were to ever scale back reinvestment, (which they have done from time to time), they become profitable very quickly, which reveals a significantly lower PE than the current forward PE.

Their devices and interface is dogshit, company culture is horrible, bad PR and branding and no quality control across the board. Out of all the big name tech the only stocks I think have good long term businesses are Apple and Microsoft. Everything else looks average at the moment and not too bright for future potential.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 01:15:34'] I am a bear in terms of the current Amazon share price, which I see as overvalued, but a bull in terms of Amazon's future growth because the company has a massive moat.All of which means that Amazon is a great buy, with great potential, once the price drops. How much does it need to drop? I will be buying shares at $1800, and buying big time if it falls to $1500.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-06 22:21:50'] Amazon owns the book industry, that’s actually fairly big still. They got audible, prime, retail, aws, they are expanding to compete with shoplify plus they sell almost anything, we just bought a pool off them. It’s not that long ago they had no pe, and it’s been coming down before the sell off, I think it’s got the most diversified of the tech giants.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 00:32:55'] Questions based on following two things 1. We are in a bear market that has some way to go ( a few months to a year imo ) before it's over.2. We have GOOG and AMZN splitting 20:1. The stock split prices make it tempting to buy. Very tempting.My concern is that the split occurs as this bear market continues.So the killer questions are:- Does the stock price go down further post split given that the bear market continues for at least a few months if not a year.- Does the stock price post split stay even until the bear market is over.- Does the stock price moon and continue to moon through the bear market as investors would be  psychologically drawn to the low price and pile in blindly.Thoughts? Are you buying pre or post split?Assuming AMZN and GOOG are $100 post split. Can you see that price going down even further IF you were sure the bear market was going to continue for at least 12 months?

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 07:13:28'] Hugely bearish in Amazon:1.) The famed Bill Parcells used to say, "You are what your record states you are," and Amazon's share price has been dead money for the past 1.5 years. 2.) AWS is a great profit center but it's becoming a ultra competitive market with some of the best of the best, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM all competing for business. Whenever you have a competitive market, profit margins erode - which is what will happen with Amazon. 3.) Trees don't grow to the sky. Amazon is such a large market cap of the overall market, and so many desperate parts, that it has become a digital conglomerate, which like the bricks and mortar type, usually don't do well long term. 4.) Their retail business is a low margin, almost loss leader, business. 5.) Streaming business - super competitive and as we have seen with the recent collapse of Netflix and the entire streaming subsector, the profit margin outlook for this subsector is expected to go nowhere but down. 6.) Labor issues - they have one of the largest workforces in the USA. Big problems on this front (unions, etc) and it could become a GM-esque type of problem.

So sure yes with the fed raising rates, the end of easy money changes the equation for its current valuation(and for all stocks) but in the long run amazon is still just getting started...if it gets down to 1000 or so(pre split price), longs might not be a bad idea if you time horizon is long enough.

[...] Although IBM refuses to disclose exact numbers, outsiders estimate that it employs well under 100,000 people at its American offices now, down from 130,000 in 2007." Interestingly, "Depending on the job, the salaries paid to Indian workers are one-half to one-fifth those paid to Americans, according to data posted by the research firm Glassdoor."Are these layoffs happening in the US? It makes a huge difference because are they firing people with average salaries of $80K ($312M in annual cost savings on around $60B in annual revenue) in the US or more like $20K ($78M)?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-20 20:22:58'] DCA... all of those things will be adjusted intonpricing no matter where you buy the item. The reason I'm holding it is for the huge AWS growth. I mean I get AMZN Prime and BooknSub for cheaper then the cost of NETFLIX !!!

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-19 18:34:36'] Amazon is a massive company, and solid investment. Its just a good business platform. While you'll suffer some short-term loss, it'll recover. The union stuff is much needed overall in the US and its just targeting Amazon. Government isn't backing fair wages, and neither are private companies, so the unions are the only option. As for shipping issues, those have been easing some, but will remain. Its my opinion that this recession is the real fallout from world closures back in 2020. It always takes time for markets to respond. We may see another 1-3 years before ATH again. So, just batten the hatches and ride the storm. Im saving every dime to throw in when I feel we've touched near bottom.

A very prominent tile manufacturer is spec’d for all the ceramic tile nationally on Amazon projects.  Needless to say, our PO for tile on this project was quite large.  I asked my tile rep if I should reserve and dock hold all the tile for the project given the large quantity of material we were needing.He advised that was not necessary because they had “millions of square feet of this tile set aside for Amazon projects.”Three weeks ago I submitted an order for the final balance of tile I need to complete the project.I was told there is a national shortage on the tile specifications for Amazon projects due to the massive and unprecedented influx of material orders that have outpaced the manufacturers forecasting.  Apparently Amazon has either not been forthcoming with its proposed construction schedule or Amazon has expanded its growth rate beyond previously disclosed levels.  Regardless of reason (I think both are true), Amazon is unilaterally cratering the largest tile manufacturer in the worlds insane tile production capabilities.  There are literally millions of square feet of tile being made as fast as possible to accommodate Amazons facility expansion needs.Calls on Amazon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 15:58:47'] If you’re looking for the post-split bump, you may have already missed it. Typically the bump comes between when it is announced and when it is implemented. Traditionally, most stocks have worse/moderate performance post split, with Tesla being the obvious exception. However, Amazon is a good stock on its own merits. It’s been frustrating for the last year, trading sideways, but I think they’re one of the mega caps to own going forward.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 10:58:19'] There are several ways a company can return value to shareholders other than pay a dividend. They can also buyback stock or invest in the business. All of these options are done from cash flows generated by the business. Something like snap doesn't generate free cash. So if you own it, you're speculating on it generating cash flows in the future. Since no one knows for sure when or how much this will be, the stock can be volatile. In contrast, a company with a regular, consistent cash flow will be less volatile (in theory). Look at CACI for example. No dividend, but does generate very regular cash flows which it reinvests.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 13:11:47'] Dividends are also speculative. You are speculating that current or historical dividends will continue to be paid in the future. While this is a pretty safe bet in many cases, it’s still a bet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:08:48'] I'm going to be the contrarian here and say that non-dividend stocks are speculative. How speculative depends on how efficient you believe the market is.Investment income comes from only two places, capital gains and dividends. While both are a function of current and future cash flows, they aren't the same. Dividends only rely on the success of the company, whereas capital gains relies on company success and other investors believing the same.I prefer to be insulated from the irrationality of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 10:55:49'] Not necessarily. Everything is speculation to a degree that is accompanied by different levels of risk. Dividends are typically paid out by company profits and cash flows. Paying out dividends by a company with stable profit and strong retained earnings is desirable, whereas incurring debt to pay those dividends or paying them when in a negative cashflow or profit position is usually a poor choice (giving out more money when youre losing cash). Companies that dont payout their shareholders are adding more to their book value and assets, assuming they profit. Since your shares represent ownership the book value of your investment will increase, but it doesnt necessarily entail the market value of your shares will increase.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:15:06'] It's not pure speculation.As an investor, you are a part owner of the business. A share represents a claim on the net assets and all future cash earnings of the business. The value of a share is the price you're willing to pay in exchange for all this cash from now till judgment day discounted at an appropriate rate.In other words, the value of a share is an expectation of all future cash distributions aka dividends you will receive.But value is not price. For any publicly traded company, the price is determined by an auction with a variety of participants. Some participants calculate this expectation and assign an intrinsic value that they bid against, others expect the expectation of others and try to profit from it.So the market price is a combination of the *expectation* and *expectation of expectations* (and if you take options, *expectation of expectations of expectations*).Now you mentioned the price drop of SNAP. This could mean one of two things:1. People expected others to pay a higher price (the bigger fool), which didn't happen or2. People's expectation of future dividends changedUsually it's a combination of both.You also mention cash on balance sheet. It's true that you cannot access this cash as a minority shareholder. So you have an added burden of determining how the management is going to use this cash (reinvestment vs distribution) and when (now, after 5 years, or never) and assign an appropriate discount to that as well. This is equivalent to having your box of gold in Canada (which you can easily access) vs North Korea (good luck with that).So while there is an element of speculation involved (with both dividend-paying and non-dividend stocks), there's also an element of aggregate expected business value.The challenge for a true investor is to separate these out. Two easy ways to do this are to buy at a significant discount and to hold for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:50:13'] If a company does not pay a dividend now, the shareholders could vote to force it to pay a dividend. The ability to withdraw the money as dividends is what gives the stock its value.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:48:41'] It's really a kind of silly question disguised as a deep question.You buy stocks to get value. Whether that value is through resale value at a higher price, future dividends, or current dividends, is basically irrelevant and only important to your individual investing style.If company A makes $100 in profit a year, the idea is that $100 either goes to make more future profit and increase the stock price, or to give shareholders current value for holding via dividends, or some combo of the two.Yes, if a company is diluting shares and not paying dividends, you should be aware of this. You are then investing because you feel the revenue they are putting towards company growth will increase the share value faster than the dilution and be a better use of that money than paying it out via dividends. If you don't think that they are making good use of the money and will increase the value, don't invest. Similarly a dividend stock is not worth investing if they needed that dividend money to grow the company, and they go under because they didn't invest that revenue wisely.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 16:34:45'] can't find it now, but prof. Robert Shiller of Yale said in one of his online courses that holding non-dividend stocks can verge close to 'greater fool theory'.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:36:02'] yes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:13:26'] > You sell higher to someone that expects to also sell higherThis is a common misconception. A dividend changes nothing about the value of a company. Suppose 2 stocks have identical fundamentals. If one issues a 5% dividend, then that stock will immediately fall 5% while the other won’t. You’re not getting a better deal by receiving the dividend. In many cases you’re getting a worse deal as dividends are often taxed more harshly. You can sell either stock and you’ll end up with the same amount of dollars in the bank. The value is coming from company cash flow, not from the idea of selling to a bigger sucker in the future
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:06:32'] See there are various angles to it, like you mentioned that if you’re just waiting to someone to buy it at higher price than you bought it that’s a speculation . But otherwise let’s say a good company with good investment skills in regards to capital allocation which is different, for example let’s take Berkshire Hathaway the chairman Warren Buffett is a very good capital allocator as compared to someone like me plus he’s a good custodian of my capital as he doesn’t take hefty salaries. So for 100$ in invest in Berkshire I get 22% of compounded returns( his average is 22% since the last 50 years) , now if I invest it in a dividend yielding company where let’s say i get 7% pa of cash first of all I dont get 7$ for my 100$ Uncle sam takes his cut of 30% so the cash i get is 4.90$ which i reinvest in the same company . In this way you can see that I’m losing out on a lot of capital where as Berkshire is reinvesting that same capital without paying me out , we’re just cutting down on alot of steps. So this way the book value of Berkshire increases yearly so my piece of cake/ business is getting biggger and bigger. Second example would be something like uber or snap , these companies are really good for the consumer but not for the investors as the capital employed by them has always given -ve returns. So we are just holding onto it for another sucker to buy it at a higher price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:23:19'] BRK.A/B don't pay a dividend and it is an elite company to hold.  They use their money to invest into more businesses rather than pay a dividend out.  I like both models personally.   Invest in company OR give shareholders $$$, can't beat it
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:59:46'] It is intended that early companies used the gains for infrastructure. However, it is a loop hole.  Musk, Bezos, Jobs did it for years or decades. Jobs was forced to pay dividend after having been in business for decades.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:22:50'] The biggest winners typically don't pay dividends. Small, fast growing companies reinvest in their business.Larger, more established companies pay dividends and do stock buybacks to appease institutional investors and because they cannot find a way to use that money to fuel growth.The real returns in the stock market come from capital appreciation. I don't own MSFT to collect a 1% dividend. I own it because I think the stock has significant upside potential.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:25:41'] Non-dividend stocks require selling them to someone else to ever make money.When you own a company, you don't have to sell it to get paid.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 13:42:48'] No, of course not. Is owning a house pure speculation because it doesn't pay dividends?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 13:43:54'] Think of it this way. If a company had 1 single share and you owned it, what would you take home every year?Example: If WMT had 1 single share, it would be worth $383 billion (the market cap). If you bought that share for that price, you would own 100% of all profits and cash flow. Net profits for the year ended 1/21/2023 totaled $17.6 billion for a one-year return on your purchase price of 4.6%. This is about 0.7% greater than what a 10-year US Treasury bond would pay you. Next year, you might take home $15 billion or $19 billion. As the owner, you can choose to pay yourself that $17.6B as a dividend to yourself or reinvest some of it back into the business or pay down some of the outstanding debt. The current owners - all the shareholders - as represented by the Board of Directors decided to pay $7.9 billion in dividends last year.It really does not matter to what extent a company does or does not pay dividends. The question is how much would you earn if YOU owned the entire business?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 13:57:43'] Your question, is an age old question and will be debated for eternity.  There is no correct answer.   But there is another option to get paid on the stock, other than what you note above.  Learn covered calls.  You can collect premium while you "speculate" on the stock going up or paying a dividend.  Essentially getting paid while you hold a stock longer term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:23:10'] Simple answer is no. Unprofitable companies are speculation. Dividend stocks are just profitable companies with enough cash flow to pay a percentage to their shareholders.  Other companies may choose to put all positive cash into growing the company or buying back shares. Speculation stocks, from my opinion, are specifically stocks that do not generate sufficient cash or even any sales but may do so in future. All companies have risk and an ability to trade at higher prices but a company with strong enough cash flow to pay a Dividend has significantly less risk than a profitable company that does not yet have the income to pay a Dividend.  Even more risk is one who posts losses or no revenue at all. Catch is, sometimes the higher the risk the bigger the rewards.  A rapidly growing company will have the share price make larger percentage moves than an older well established company. Some up and some down. For long-term safe investments, go with dividends. For higher potential reward,  consider the ones that are still developing. Personally I have both, high risk speculative stock I trade and Dividend and ETFs I hold for retirement.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:28:39'] Snap owner here. Lol.. but it's the hope for a brighter future. Not a smart one but I'm hoping it does recover as I am in red. Market gives it a value even if it may not look too rosy imo. It's valued to it's peers is my rough guess.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:30:50'] But here is the thing. You CAN request to trade your stock directly with the company for the cash equivalent. It is called a stock buyback and you can vote at the shareholder meeting to increase the amount of share buybacks. Companies buy the shares back from the general market based off of the goals of the managing committee, but generally with the goal of buying back as many shares as possible at or below a certain multiple, though bad management will sometimes approve share buybacks at inflated multiples just to say they initiated a share buyback (see META).The only time you are speculating on a stock is when a stock is unable to generate profits at current margins and are promising better margins once economies of scale kick in. Companies with negative earnings but strong margins could theoretically discontinue the growth reinvestment and grow more naturally, but aren't so long as investors are willing to give them more money to grow faster.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:56:44'] No, it is unprofitable companies that are speculative.  Successful and profitable companies can allocate free cash flow to debt reduction, dividends, stock buybacks, new capital investments or acquisitions.The most successful stocks are the ones that can make new capital investments or acquisitions that are accretive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 16:37:23'] I actually think you have a point but it’s more of a spectrum.Let’s say we have a non dividend stock BUT it announces that it will give a dividend in 2 years. Or that some investors think it’s obvious they will do so based on its financials. Or its dividend got suspended due to taking government money but it totally could give a dividend. Yeah, all of these are kinda speculative points but it’s not like they’re baseless investments.Or let’s say that we have a stock with a nice dividend but it’s deeply unprofitable. Investors deduce that the dividend inevitably has to be cut. Is it a worse investment than the company which will give a dividend in the future? Again, I think your general principle is correct, just that there’s grey areas.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 17:51:38'] I've lost more with dividend stocks so.......
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 20:55:59'] Definition: Speculation involves trading a financial instrument involving high risk, in expectation of significant returns.Investing your money into the stock market IS speculation, no matter what stock you’re investing in. All the projections depend on historical or statistical data, none of which are guaranteed to happen. You can do as much research as you want but, you can only predict what MIGHT happen, not what WILL happen thus, pure speculation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 12:30:56'] No. Growth stocks are typically sans dividend because the money spent on dividends can yield higher returns than the market average. Dividends are an admission by the company that they can’t invest the money better than you. Thats all.

Tends to be a bit of a runup during the split, but drop a lot after. That said, we just recovered (somewhat) from a nasty bear market for tech stocks, so could be good dip to buy right now. Bottom line, nobody (least of all me) knows, but Amazon is a good company overall, just a tad overvalued. A consistent DCA makes sense for this one but not leading up to split, go throughout/ after it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 16:23:16'] First priority is maxing out Roth, which is 80% a 2065 Target Retirement Date Fund (and 20% VIG/SCHD). Planning to buy only the TDF I think. It has 10% bonds already so I will benefit from the high yields and high dividends of the ex-US stocks. I plan do accomplish this by June (maybe $1K a month Roth, $1K a month taxable). Not sure about VIG/SCHD: should I combine them? Or just simplify and go 100% TDF? Second priority for my taxable portfolio is to continue increasing the weight of my index funds, in particular my small cap value tilts. Of my index funds: my goal is 40% VTI + 25% VXUS + 20% AVUV (US SCV) + 15% AVDV (ex-US developed SCV) I'm nearly there. But these indices currently make up only 66% of my taxable portfolio, and the rest are individual stocks/sector ETFs. I'd like to make the index fund portion much higher, say 75% by end of year, and 80% end of next year. But I will continue to buy occasional dips in stocks I like, and take profits where needed and redeploy back into index funds.My goal is not to preserve my portfolio but growth, so I'm willing to take an extra aggressive approach by tilting the deepest value of the market: small cap value. I bought too many individual stocks, but I'm performing right in line with VT and the S&P 500 so unless I start dramatically underperforming, I'll be okay with it.Individual stocks I would like to build bigger positions into:- MSFT/GOOG for big tech, but only on even bigger discounts from now (< 200 for MSFT or < 80 for GOOG, for instance) to really justify it- XOM/PSCE for energy. XOM only if it drops into the 80s/90s.- AMD in 50s or lower- SBUX in 80s- JPM sub 110- Possible new position in UNP/DE/CAT only if there is a large downturn- New position in a copper play (FCX?)Exit it out if price action turns bullish:- DIS- TGT - Trim AMD if it skyrockets irrationally

If that happens, the online retailers service quality and growth plans could be at risk, and its e-commerce dominance along with it. Raising wages and increasing warehouse automation are two of the six levers Amazon could pull to delay this labor crisis by a few years, but only a series of sweeping changes to how the company does business and manages its employees will significantly alter the timeline, Amazon staff predicted. If we continue business as usual, Amazon will deplete the available labor supply in the US network by 2024, the research, which hasnt previously been reported, says.\n\nThe report warned that Amazons labor crisis was especially imminent in a few locales, with internal models showing that the company '

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 17:41:17'] Wondering what the returns would be if you only bought the S&P index on days when it down over 3% and then just held.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 21:37:55'] Hence why dollar cost averaging is so important. If you find a company with strong growth and profitability, waiting until the day after it falls after helps with long-term accumulation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 22:07:50'] Isn't this going to be true for almost every single year? The market is going to move up/down throughout the year, and I bet if you cherrypick the 5 best and worst days you can come up with some stats like the OP.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 16:30:35'] Another reason not to panic during these trading sessions.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 18:33:14'] Each of the 3 times that the market has dumped in 2022, it does so with some large hits like the days noted, and others of smaller increments.  cumulatively they account for -10% and higher declines each time it heads down.  We are currently in a 4th decline, I estimate this one will be a total of -13% by bottom before it bounces to head up, before declining again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 21:39:59'] It will be similar on the way back up(eventually)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 08:31:30'] but most of the year was declining, so you would have needed to sell right when you had a gain, or, sell at a loss in order to avoid a bigger loss...

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 08:42:30'] You’re not foolish to let them pick. The most important thing right now, in a declining market, is to keep investing. And perhaps even increase your percentage invested. Red markets are where serious (long term) money is made.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-17 13:32:25'] Unless you have extensive experience in picking, you can't be sure that their picks are any better or worse than your own.  OTOH, you can never be sure whose interests they're REALLY concerned with.I siggest that old favorite, "Trust...but verify."

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 11:56:19'] No, you're doing exactly the right thing. It would be foolish to try picking them yourself imo. Also, try not to think about it as 'picking stocks'. It's much more about hedging against risk. That's the more important part.Definitely start your own taxable brokerage account if you want to play with picking some stocks, but don't do that for your 401k.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:18:56'] My girlfriend works at Amazon, the broker that works for Amazon will control your 401k plan by default which they will pick and manage your investments,  but you can go into your brokerage account and change your investments,  it's your money ! If you want to control it you can or they will do it for you !
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 08:31:28'] You should open your 401k account and see where the money is going. I understand that it can be overwhelming, but this is something you can’t just let stay unknown. Actually knowing the funds that your money is sitting will removing the “?” from “stocks?”. Would you be upset if that money disappeared tomorrow? Is sanely you answer yes, then you should go figure out where your money is! Investing carries risk, and if that’s not something you’re down for, then you can opt out. It’s not up to Amazon to decide how to spend your money. They just default a retirement fund,  because way too many in the past just didn’t select any investment at all and were pissed that they missed out on gains. A 401k is your money, don’t just let your employer dictate your work AND what you do with your wage after. TLDR: That money is yours, and you’re placing a lot of blind trust in something that you can just look up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 07:22:42'] There are three Canadian companies that are IMO prime takeout targets over the next few years: Skylight health group, CloudMD and Diagnos Inc. All three have been absolutely destroyed because they are small caps, but represent good opportunities. Skylight is a health clinic M&A company, it jumped yesterday due to the acquisition of One Medical. CloudMD is an enterprise healthcare service provider, it trades less than 1x revenue and will be profitable in the near term. It also has a very healthy balance sheet.Diagnos Inc is an AI healthcare company that scans retinas to detect for diabetes. It has deals with Essilor and New Look for service and it is currently building out the network. It should also be nearing profitability by the end of this year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 14:31:13'] If anything, One Health just shows how screwed Amazon is. The fact that they're messing around with a company that barely crests half a billion in yearly revenue is ignoring it's biggest problem: it's retail operation is getting old and they need to meaningfully derive more value out of it, and/or find a way to make AWS even bigger and more meaningful.   If they are going to go the Berkshire/Microsoft route and grow by acquisition, they should start acting like a trillion-dollar-plus company and buy Target or Lowes or something meaningful and stop messing around with small caps.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 09:10:37'] CLFD - this is a true growth stock. They grew like 90% YoY and their backlog is up like 104% YoY. There is still government money pouring into rural broadband. AIT - Boring company that deals with like transmission fluids and bearings. They raised full year guidance and will do well as more company spend to reshore back in the US. Plus the fact with the labor shortage, they deal with automation machinery and we will see more companies spend in this space. ANET - Still expensive stock, but their return on capital has been amazing for a while. It's really well ran company and the thing about cloud, companies will always need more space. Whenever a company comes up with a new feature, this usually requires new api's/db's etc. In this down market, the forward PE has come down to be a really solid pickup.

The first two are exceptional businesses, long-term holdings and don't require much mental energy - I don't think about them day-to-day, don't have to think about micromanaging the holdings, etc. MEDP has been a solid performer over the years and their CEO did one of the better insider buys I've ever seen, hoovering up tens of millions of dollars worth of shares in September before the company had an exceptional quarter about a month later and the stock soared about 30%+ in a day."Google & Amazon are very close to their 52 week lows this morning and continue to look like an appealing long term buy"Why does it seem like people are focused on AMZN/GOOG instead of MSFT? If I had to buy a mega cap tech co at this point I'd rather MSFT. Google is almost entirely reliant on advertising, which is a lousy place to be every time there is a downturn - it's still disappointing that several years later the Alphabet conglomerate structure has gone largely wasted as the company never really diversified in the manner that was talked up when it acted like it was going to become a tech Berkshire several years ago. I think people should consider not just sticking to the playbook of owning tech household names (there's a good chance people won't be able to rely on the same playbook they've relied upon for the last decade in the years ahead); own *some* tech (requiring focusing on best choices rather than "all the tech") and have at least moderate diversification to other sectors - there's growth stories outside of tech. What is an appropriate % allocated to tech is going to be different for everyone but I think the sort of 75%+ tech portfolios that may have worked over the last decade aren't going to be appropriate over the next few years, at least.

Higher interest rates are great, since they make more on their cash holdings. VGR- tobacco will continue to sell, and they will continue to pay dividends. Since they are in discount tobacco, they potentially can grab a few people moving down market. OXM- their brands cater to upscale clientele. As of now, they are showing no signs of flagging demand, which is more than most apparel names can say. Nice little dividend and debt repayment should help their shares as well.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 19:06:37'] It's always difficult to predict which specific stocks will perform the best in the coming year, as the market is influenced by a wide range of factors. That being said, it's important to do your own research and consider a range of factors when making investment decisions.In terms of technology stocks, both Google and Amazon have strong brands and have demonstrated strong growth in the past. Both companies have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and may present opportunities for long-term growth. It's important to carefully consider the financial health and future growth prospects of both companies before making a decision.In terms of diversification, it's generally a good idea to have a diversified portfolio that includes a range of asset classes and industries. This can help mitigate risk and provide more stability in the event that one sector or industry underperforms.Ultimately, the decision on which stocks to invest in will depend on your own financial goals and risk tolerance. It may be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor to help you make informed investment decisions.

POST_TEXT: b'Have been paying close attention to Canoo. I think those cars are pretty neat and definitely out of this world design, but when it comes to companys stock I am not so sure. They promised they would deliver their first production late 2022, nothing. When you check their website, they always pride themselves with businesses that are ordering their cars, but stock shows otherwise. It is below $1 now. What do yall think about this? Is this legit or perfect example of a scam?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 07:23:20'] I followed them back during the SPAC craze. I think they are destined to fail personally. It’s a vehicle that has missed initial delivery dates and makes a vehicle that has a very niche purpose. I can’t see this thing being broadly purchased and driven by average people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 07:39:59'] I personally like the design of their vehicles but anyone can make a nice design.Canoo has to start producing and selling ASAP. They have the 'orders' from companies like Walmart and expect to be able to have a 20k production rate by the end of this year but time is ticking. They are running out of cash and even then, they probably won't be profitable for years.They already issued a going concern statement last year. If they are that close, I find it difficult for them to pull it off. They are probably betting on having the vehicle out that will then push the stock price higher and then sell more equity to continue operations but EV's are a huge money drain. There are way better companies to invest in with a much lower degree of risk if you are interested in EV's.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 07:58:06'] Neither legit nor a scam.  Great idea that, unfortunately, will probably not come to fruition.  They’ll go bust and the scraps will get bought.  Maybe someone else will turn the modular concept into a successful product, but I doubt it will happen under Canoo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 09:43:39'] I think it’s a perfect time to buy. If there wasn’t this much doubt and speculation, the stock price would be higher! So once the public has a reason it will go higher. Even then they will want the stock above $1 to keep it listed so it will still be a gain in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 11:06:31'] I'm not a Canoo fanboy, but I'm impressed with the CEO putting his money where his mouth is and having ~20% ownership. It wasn't that long ago he put down another $10 million.  It's definitely a speculative play. EV's are similar to dotcom stocks - many will go bankrupt after all the massive hype, and a select few will survive, then thrive. AAPL, AMZN, PCLN etc. traded as low as 50 cents a share. Will GOEV do something similar? I don't know, but I threw a little bit of gambling money at it. If it doesn't work out, it will simply be a tax write-off, which will decrease the amount I will pay the IRS.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 16:28:07'] They have been shady in the past. I remember a year or two ago, their CFO just resigned with no reason and then one of their largest customers (I believe it was Mitsubishi) was removed from their site and not mentioned on their earnings calls. I think a lot of false rumors get spun up about them to do pump and dumps and they are not a real company. Like people saying Apple was going to buy them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-25 15:13:57'] Thanks y’all for comments/feedback. I loved the concept, I thought it was pretty neat. I’ve invested in them, but their stock literally went down the drain. With all the “contracts” they say they have, I’m not sure it will bounce back. They promised to have cars on the road by December 2022, it’s March 2023 and nothing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 20:50:09'] Concepts and prototypes are easy, production is hard. 90%+ of EV start-ups are dead men walking, including these. Even if they do ramp production they'll need to raise so much cash the current stock will be worthless.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 21:44:31'] Ask people how much they are down, if they still own, then go from there....
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 23:31:42'] I suggest a look at RIDE instead, for an innovative EV company, anyways. Already delivering vehicles. Recent recall from today, which you might see, is only affecting 19 vehicles, a small electrical connector they are swapping out. The hub motors they are using are the coolest innovation in EV, imo. Foxconn is backing them financially and logistically.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 04:01:36'] I wouldn't touch off a company that does direct offerings and dilutes shareholders recklessly due to their incompetence to use capital efficiently the first time round. I am just guessing on this, but how they scored contracts with well-established institutions is probably by giving them an offer they could not refuse (i.e., literally selling their cars for a loss).

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 14:54:28'] because they are not separate listings of the same stock - they are separate corporate entities entirely- domino's pizza e.g (dpz) is US, canada- domino's pizza group (dom) is uk, ireland and germany- domino's pizza enterprises (dmp) is australia, new zealand, france, netherlands etc.and so on. they share the branding/name and the same model (e.g franchised fast food/delivery pizza) but otherwise operate as separate entities

POST_TEXT: b'Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week has sold more than $3 billion worth of shares in his company, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission compiled by OpenInsider.\n\nBezos has accelerated his stock sales in the last year. In August, Bezos offloaded more than $3.1 billion of Amazon shares, after selling more than $4.1 billion worth of shares in February. The sales this week bring his total cash out in 2020 to more than $10.2 billion so far, which is a notable jump from 2019, when Bezos sold $2.8 billion worth of shares.\n\nEven with the latest stock sale, Bezos still owns more than 53 million shares worth nearly $170 billion, making him the richest person in the world.\n\nThe transactions were made as part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, according to the filings.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-04 19:37:53'] All of these were structured pre-planned sells. This tells me he wants to buy something or grow something. It was mentioned in this thread of him buying CNN. Im throwing my tin foil hat into the ring with Blue Origin is almost ready to pop off. A 10B investment right now would go a long way to getting the new shepherd finalized and the new glen up and running.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-04 17:04:52'] Yesterday I heard that he's interested in expanding his media empire by purchasing CNN. He actually has been very good for the Washington Post.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 18:28:18'] A huge part of the recession is inflationary. A good bet in environments like this in the past is to buy commodity producers. When the money machine started brrrrrrring I went hard on XOM and FCX. XOM has hit, but FCX is still at an attractive price imo.

I've agreed with a lot of the growth stock picks here, but one of my old guy favorite picks right now, which I'm dropping about 50% of my contribution to right now is Hanes Brand. Yeah, I know, boring, but everyone has a hoodie, or a pair of boxers, or a 3 pack of cheap t-shirts, etc.  We can debate whether we're in a recession but with YOC over 8%, I'll hedge on that while also picking up cheap growth stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 17:10:45'] Google. A stronger ad business plus a stronger cloud business plus a stronger cable business (Youtube TV). There is a lot of potential here, especially if the Cloud continues to grow massively.Facebook at these levels could be great as well. Even if the metaverse doesn't pan out the market cap is so low relative to fundamentals. Although Apple handicapping their ad targeting is pretty nerve racking.

So, what do I really know? Eh. I've made worse decisions with my money. At least with stocks I've got a chance to make money. I've been mostly sticking to "safe" stocks aka stocks from companies that I don't think are going anywhere because they sell things that people use in their every day lives.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 22:57:26'] Based on your assumption, ask yourself - HOW MUCH VC money will be going into growth over the next 5-7 years? Not much.So big tech will be the only exit for SaaS and other innovators (if they are allowed ofc). Disclosure: I own Activision as an arbitrage play.Also, geopolitics are getting a lot hotter. There will be beneficiaries and losers. Apple is swerving to India for their supply chain but that will take them probably a decade. Yet, big tech once again will be able to leverage their cash flows and balance sheets to adjust quickly to the new realities. They also lobby a lot, so that the pace of decoupling is manageable for them but few others.TLDR: MSFT, GOOG, ane even META because you can't win wars without propaganda.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 17:49:16'] Assuming the prices came down in the event of a more prolonged recession, my top picks for a quality tilt not too tech dominated would be:1. HD or LOW*2.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 17:51:25'] If I were just sort of buying and forgetting I would aim for companies that I had a relatively high degree of confidence in still being positioned similarly or better 10 years from now. In tech I would be most inclined towards Amazon and Microsoft probably. I don't think Apple is a bad choice but I have always had some skepticism about it being the Oldsmobile or Cadillac of tech. A huge part of its value comes from high end consumer loyalty and if that loyalty fades it would end up very overvalued. Mind you, I'm not saying this will happen, just that it is a risk. With Google I am quite confident that they will stay at the center of innovation for the foreseeable future. My concern there is that the way they are monetized (ads) doesn't have a lot to do with innovation. So, if ad revenue takes a big and lasting hit (which is a known risk) then you could end up with a much bigger version of our well known Not Incredibly Profitable Really Cool Disruptor type of company.The other way I could go is just very basic basic products, like food (ADM, Bunge), liquor (MGPI), or electrical utilities (e.g ED, BKH, etc.).

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 12:12:16'] I know that you are assuming there’s a recession, but honestly the economy outlook **in America exclusively** looks very good. Inflation is decreasing, unemployment is crazy low, a dollar that’s getting stronger every day, the insane bubbles that never made sense have already done most of their popping (speculative tech stocks, Crypto), and America’s light jog into industrial policy (CHIPS act, infrastructure spending, tons of clean energy incentives) is driving a lot of domestic investment into the real economy.It’s not going to be the best time for the stock market necessarily, but it’s a very debated topic amongst economists if we are even going to enter a minor recession at all.

Amazon,Apple, google and Microsoft aren’t going to grow that quickly. Neither is Meta but I still think it’s a great value playFor 1000% I would suggest looking into companies with a market cap below $40 billion with a lot of potential in tech.

It’s a toss up between Google and Amazon if I had to pick one. Palantir is valued at $15B, has $2.4B in cash, no debt, and plans on crossing a $500M milestone quarter next quarter. They have government contracts as their anchor to get through recessions and limitless growth for commercial. Ranks #1 (above Microsoft and AWS) for worldwide AI software. Robinhood gets a lot of hate but breaks so many barriers in the finance industry. Offering 3% on cash?! I think FTX going down and not being regulated will bring FTX and Binance users over to Robinhood. FTX owner will need to pull his stake out of Robinhood (if he hasn’t already) - so it could get ugly in the short term.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 14:37:12'] I bought so much Amazon today it’s currently more than 50% of my portfolio (7 figure number that I built up over the years). I have never been so bullish about a company. Both the fundamentals and the technicals look so strong that I cannot see a way to loose money if entering at the current price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 14:53:24'] Just to give my rationale on why I’m so bullish on Amazon.On the fundamentals side, Amazon has a market cap of ~1.68T, which is lower than Google’s 1.8T, even though their revenue (390m) and net income (22m) are both higher. On the growth side, Google has most of it’s revenue from ads (147 of the 182b) same as Facebook. Amazon is just getting into building this income stream out! And they have much better data for targeted retail advertising, so the potential is incredibly huge. On top of this, they lead the cloud market, prime video is becoming more popular than netflix, they own Twitch TV (e-sports are getting huge) and they are innovating and entering new sectors like crazy!If you consider this, Amazon has a reliable, recession proof (but low margin) stream of income from e-commerce and a huge growth potential in high margin cloud and advertising. And it’s still valued lower than other tech companies today!On the technical side, even the cautious wall street price estimates are about $4500, but some go as high as $6000! And I think even that is too cautious. Moreover, there is a clear support line at around $3000, meaning that something horrible would need to happen to have a lower downside than that. So the upside is huge with limited downside.On the antitrust issues: Amazon has no monopoly in any single industry. They are large because they have their hands in many things, but if you consider one industry, there is no monopoly, clear as day. And they have a team of lawyers and unlimited money to fight these allegations.Also, the end of covid will not affect sales as much as people expect. Not many people who got used to next day delivery will go back to waisting half a Saturday just to get their stuff from a brick and mortar store.I could keep going on about why the Amazon share price is clearly undervalued today, but I won’t because if you can’t see it yourself I’m not gonna be the on who should convince you.

In many locations, physical stores were shut down or forced to operate with restrictions. As businesses flocked to Shopify, shares surged.

And it is **heavily in debt** so it may even need to issue new stocks if it can't hold onto the profits.Sure they have increased their revenue so much but having a 30-70% growth isn't sustainable and is unlikely that any company can keep that going for a long time.Why do you believe they can continue to increase their revenue?

Now more people will be able to take advantage of this feature and spend more money on amazon shopping. It will increase amazon e-commerce revenue and market shares as more young people like to use the buy now, pay later feature.'

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 23:33:11'] I dont know it this is good news for the stock but I generally dislike this form of business. It is targeting poor and vulnerable people in many cases.

It also puts a lot of risk in the business so it might not be that much of a benefit for the stock.

POST_TEXT: b'\nHey Everyone,\nFirst time posting on here. Me and my fianc are working on reallocating our money in our retirement fund to reduce some risk to the downside over the coming year. Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think.\n\n20% S&P index fund,\nXLK - 5%,\nXLI - 5%,\nXLP - 20.25%,\nXLU - 10%,\nXLB - 2.5%,\nXLV - 18%,\nXLC - 5%,\nXLE - 5.5%,\n5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM.\n\nEssentially were leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.\n\nRemaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.\n\nEdit: Just so we are all clear, the bottom 23.75% is for us to DCA into A'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 21:21:46'] so really you are increasing exposure to big tech.  that doesn’t sound like de-risking but rather adding risk. if you reduce financials, consumer discretionary and real estate you are naturally increasing everything else.  and by buying MSFT GOOGL AAPL AMZN etc you are doubling your exposure to that sector.if you want to reduce risk you should be owning less of these companies and diversifying more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 22:21:48'] Sounds like a bad idea
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 21:25:24'] This sounds like a shitty plan tbh.

Remaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etcYou said you want to reduce risk, yet you add more allocation to technology companies - which has been the winners of the last decade. Most of the time, the winner of the last decade are not the winners of the next one, and by removing sectors you are taking away diversification and thus risk. For example Financials do better than during high interest rates as they can offer better spreads to their customer (the difference between the fed interest rate and what they offer the customers). In contrast technology does worse, as their ability to generate loses declines. In high interest rate environments, the hurdle rate for investment increases -  so people are less likely to own companies that start to make money in 10 years. Real Estate protects against inflation better than tech for examples.By reducing sector exposure and buying single companies that are in a single correlated sector, you increase your risk.If you want to decrease your risk, you would add emerging markets or other developed markets (Europe, Australia, Japan etc) to your portfolio. You can also add bonds for example.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 03:37:57'] I think you gonna increase your risk.If market go to moon probably you might profit more
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 03:57:21'] I agree with others. If you really want to de-risk in the short term, you could shift into short term bond etfs. The short term (<1yr) treasury etf pays out interest around 4.4% with little interest rate risk. Ticker SHV.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 03:22:46'] If you’re going to go heavy on consumer staples and utilities, best to hold off or ease into positions for the time being. Not saying the idea isn’t good (or bad), just nows not the best time to be overweight on these sectors.Institutional money has the same idea over the past couple of months. They have inflated the valuations the components of XLP, XLV, and XLU to the point where they are no longer “value” plays. These companies now have P/E ratios in the 20s even though they have single digit return on capital. These companies have low growth potential and low margins so overpaying for them makes little sense.If you expect a market downturn, it would be reasonable to assume capitulation in these overbought sectors. Thats when I would step in. We’re already starting to see weakness in XLV and XLP.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 08:09:24'] Indexing and dollar-cost averaging is the solution to market ignorance. It's the ***best solution*** for people who have a ***time frame greater than 10 years***, and who prefer to spend their time on things other than paying attention to a basket of businesses.**Indexing negates both temperament (nerves) and skill.**It is a solution that is set it and forget it, like a crock pot meal on low. There's no timing involved. If you leave the crock pot on an extra day, no big deal. Your stew is still good. Leave a cake in the oven 5 minutes more than the prescribed bake time, you've got a burnt cake. Take it out 5 minutes early, you've got an under cooked mess.When ignorant investors start piss-assing around trying to improve things, as a class they can do nothing other than make returns worse. The odds are against success. You are fighting taxes, fees, and all the psychological biases inherent in human behavior.Buy a low cost S&P500 index, dollar cost average, and leave it the hell alone for 30 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 10:21:45'] Why would you give up the dividends you receive quarterly? The S&P 500 is diversified enough and will be back to its highs in no time. You’re not accomplishing anything by reallocating right now other than selling after paper losses. Feels like everyone has been investing since 2020 and thinks it’s a get rich quick type of game. Time in the market beats timing the market and If you stop meddling with your investments anytime macro moves this way or that, you’ll be far happier in the future.

If so, that could be a heavy factor in your decision, as you'll need to have high confidence your portfolio will beat the index by at least the loss in preferential tax treatment.I'd cut XLT as well and put it in small-cap value, which has outperformed in prior recoveries, including in high rate/inflation conditions. Depending on how much you're working with, it may be worth it to pay for MPT/Black-Litterman SaaS to make sure you're at least on the efficient frontier.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 00:37:37'] You’re definitely adding more risk. The tech sector is high risk. You should consider iBonds to lower risk. I’m all cash right now except for some mining stocks and ETF’s. I trade options on a small level. I won’t reinvest until I feel the market is more stable.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 07:30:28'] Overall kind of hate this tbh. But there is info missing. How long have you been invested, how in the profit are you, how old and how much money.Your gonna likely pay a huge tax bill and my guess is you will come back. So now you need to time this correctly twice to get back in and are already starting behind due to the tax payment.You have to assume it drops significantly and then also buy back in before things rip further. The odds are against you.Maybe just sell a smaller percentage buy some short term cd or treasury and come back in later when you feel it’s safer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 10:01:07'] The average return in the stock market is 10% nominal. The average return of cash is 0%.The lost opportunity cost of yout dollar cost averaging is going to cost you more in Expected Return than any sector tilt can possibly make up for.If you really want to factor tilt, it should be done all at once. Leaving money in cash for a prolonged period of time while you wait for something you like - when stocks are already down 15-30% depending on sector - is not a good idea. Seperately, if you had the ability to market time and pick winners and losers - you would have sold ans re-allocated a year ago. Therefore you likely don’t have the ability and are just reacting based on fear and emotion.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello all, perhaps a dumb question but one that Ive been thinking on. Lets say you buy into a company, lets use AMZN as an example. You intend to hold this company until retirement, if thats the case why do people care when the company rallies 8% in a day or something similar in the short term. Do they hope that there wont be a pull back? They wouldnt (in most cases) be able to sell and buy back at a lower price if theyve been holding for a while, so I dont really get it. \n\nThanks!'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 19:36:15'] People buy and hold all the time through mutual funds in 401ks. Rally's don't really matter except for people who are sitting there with their finger on the trigger. They're the ones who will worry about the losses. Most people in the 401K business of investing just sit there and say it'll come back in 20 years.People weathered Covid and the housing collapse. Those who held were rewarded.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 19:17:11'] So not everyone buys and holds. I bought Amzn this morning and sold at 122. Was a great day. For people that do buy and hold the rallies don’t matter other than the fact it lets you know the market likes the company and it’s direction. Why would you hold for life in a failing company? Not implying anything about Amzn.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 20:00:09'] If a company drops 8%, then there's a reason for that, usually significant worse future outlook.That 8% drop represents a market comsensus that the company is valued 8% less than yesterday. There is no automatic mechanism that this will be evened out tomorrow, so you might end up with 8% less in your retirement. If you are Warren Buffet and invest only inside your circle of competence, then you are smarter than the market and you can ignore any 8% drop. Most of us, however, are neither Warren Buffet nor smarter than the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 19:35:15'] Amazon is back down lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 23:28:53'] No investment should be designated as *unconditionally* long term.Large, quick moves in either direction frequently serve as indicators to evaluate company health and check against your thesis.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 19:10:53'] A company existing in 5 years does not make owning it a good investment. Roku existed 5 years ago as a public company and is down 20% over that time. TDOC the same and is down 30% over that time. ZM as well, and you'd actually be up 9% over 5 years with that one!Maybe one of these is the next Amazon, or maybe they all just continue to not be profitable.

Yes, I do think that some won’t. Companies that aren’t pulling a profit and rely on massive amounts of debt to grow their business will start being bought out for pennies on the dollar or eventually facing bankruptcy. Others will “be around” but never reach the bubble prices we saw during Covid. “Being around” is a low bar for an investment. Blackberry gained 500% from 2005-2007. Look at what it did since then. It is “still around” too. > These stocks are all down like 80% or more from ATHs and a lot of these stocks are trading well below pre-pandemic levels QE and low interest rates started way before the pandemic. The companies you go on and list are companies that survived those downturns. This is called “survivorship bias”. If Cathie was investing back then she’d be owning Pets.co, boo.com, and Palm inc.- I see nothing special or revolutionary about Teledoc. It is Zoom for telehealth appointments. I think anyone who had to do a telehealth consultation during Covid will agree that they are at best annoying, and at worst a total scam. I had to do one and waited a half hour past my time just for the nurse to tell me the problem I was having couldn’t be diagnosed over the phone. They still charged me $60 of course. I also did a handful of these during Covid and none of them were Teledoc. How are they special? I see dozens of competitors. - Zoom, what is special about them either? Microsoft and Google both have competing products. Why on earth did they ever deserve to be $500/share? - Roku: Maybe it’s because I tend to buy Samsung, but I haven’t had a tv that used anything Roku related in about a decade. How were they ever worth $400/share when again, they are a company that does nothing disruptive and there are bigger competitors who already do what they do and more? They made sense when smart TVs weren’t as prolific and streaming was just taking off, as you could buy a box for your dumb TV. Those are just some of the companies you posted that I think make zero sense to me. I actually like Shopify as a concept, as well as block. But it’s all about how things were over-valued.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 18:54:03'] You’re comparing her stocks to some of the greatest companies over the past several decades. These stocks may still exist in five years but that doesn’t mean they have to be worth more than their ATH. Especially since many of these companies have heavy dilution that will hurt their climb back, and since you’re arguing for a fund you need to outperform enough to cover the expense of the fund.If you want to argue in favor you need an argument why her companies will have sustained growth and outperformance for at least a decade. Just because a stock went down doesn’t make it a buy. If you want outperformance research factor investing and what factors have historically outperformed the market (hint: it isn’t unprofitable growth stocks).
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 07:06:55'] This isn't how you think about investing. You're speculating based on past price performance without doing any fundamental analysis.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 19:34:25'] If you want to buy Tesla, Zoom, Shopify or any of the other stocks you listed then go buy them. Why would you trust Cathy Wood after her track record? She got in at very high valuations, sold things that she said she will never sell. She doesn’t seem to understand something basic that you understand. The price you pay matters. You want to get into those stocks because you think they are cheap. Once Cathy decides a company is innovative, she buys at whatever price regardless of how high the valuation is.

You don't make money by purchasing stocks that are 80% down from their ath.I'd suggest you to start learning about business valuation or, if you have no time or are lazy, dca into index fund and call it a day.

Companies that are basically nothing but software are always in danger of suddenly becoming obsolete or superceded by someone else over night. There is little in the way of 'brand loyalty' or 'sunken cost for customers'  that can keep such a company alive long enough to restructure and try to regain a foothold in the event.I also think she's in over her head with her stance on genomics/molecular diagnostics and some of her pharma bets.

Zuckerberg is throwing money away on a Metaverse project that at this point looks like it will be a failure.To me this doesn't change why I like META as an investment. I like META because they are an advertising giant, with trillions of datapoints on consumers. META is a cash generating machine, with an All time great Balance Sheet.The only reason I haven't been buying into META, is because Google has these same strengths, with less of the downside of META. But META being valued at ~320B makes it a very attractive investment to me.In the next bull market, I believe, at a minimum, META will 2x from where it is right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 02:54:20'] The point that you are missing here is that there may well be reasons why these companies can drop lower, or even not return to their pre-crash highs for many many years to come. Higher interest rates and depressed savings mean that people might have less free cash to buy al sorts of consumer goods and the companies have to borrow at higher rates. The unlimited FED growth is over and so the unlimited growth of the share prices of companies that benefited heavily from the loose monetary policies of the past decade.   All of these companies are still heavily **overvalued** and most of them are losing money. You can be right and still lose alot because you are heavily exposed to valuation risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:54:20'] Everyone is broke and the only new money entering the system any time soon is going to be in the form of combatting COVID waves (inflationary) and paying for a ground war/defense in Europe (also inflationary).The economic outlook is bleak and central banks have abandoned their inflation mandates entirely.

My parents are selling everything just to stay afloat, as they’ve retired years ago, and younger generations are living paycheck to paycheck on marginalized credit cards and personal loans.The world is going to experience true deflation because nobody can afford anything at current prices.  You know it, I know it, the FED knows it (but won’t admit it) so what’s your game plan, exactly?Mine is to hoard cash and live on that, absolutely within my means, until the economic outlook isn’t as obviously bleak as it currently is.

My company uses it a bit (and I’ve heard others as well). UI needs more AI capability. The bots break too often with any code promotion.

There may be a couple of these companies that become huge, but most will likely not do well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 10:15:31'] I don’t own any Arkk now ( but I bought some at under $40 in June and sold the august top at $52 (right after seeing zoom video become the top holding and reading Cathy’s  “bear case is $700 by 2026”For a video app with no moat that could be replaced any day by something better. Most businesses  are using Microsoft teams. Dropped 90% since 2020 peak..But tbh anything starts to look better valued after that kind of decline.. zoom now valued at 20 billion..A lot of other holdings have potential though..

Some will be scarred forever.    Breaking rocks in the hot sun    You fought the Fed, and the Fed won.    Personally, I am jacked for these 4% rates.

They are mostly money losing, issue excessive SBC and are still expensive (Zoom is still at over 4.5x P/S with that amount of SBC). You are price anchoring. Just because something was even more overvalued, doesn't mean it is cheap now

Currently all production is in Russia, so they will be in a nice niche. CLH- solid waste collection and disposal will continue to grow. They also just developed a process to break down forever chemicals, so that's nice. DAR- collecting waste and processing it into ingredients. Durable business, but I really like their green diesel business. There's a diesel crunch in America and they have new diesel refinery capacity coming online next year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 02:03:47'] The obvious pick for me is TSLA, but I wouldn't consider that a sneaky pick, so I'd say COIN. They have a ton of cash, they're the most transparent and trusted brokerage out there which is a huge deal right now, they might inherit a huge part of Binance's market share if they indeed go bust like FTX, and their leadership is top of the bill. The only real risk for Coinbase at this valuation is that crypto might not become mainstream, but I think that risk is small over the long term.As for Stellantis, I don't see how they're not going bankrupt tbh. Maybe not over the next 5 years, but their leadership is terrible and they're gonna have a hard time transitioning to EVs.

POST_TEXT: b'So I got in to Amazon at $3590 a share since it was and still is a fantastic company and while I am very bullish on Amazon I know I am only human and can of course overlook things that may be hurt the stock price and/or company so I was wondering if anyone could layout any long term bear cases or long term reasons why they would not invest in Amazon and wether the decline in the stock price is simply due to short term macro economic effects.'

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-11 00:35:06'] Here are a few:* Increased delivery costs due to higher fuel prices and increasing wages. * Lower consumer spending, after the spending boost of the pandemic as inflation increases and people will move towards experiences again -> this trend has been confirmed in the earnings of Paypal. * High inflation rates and potential higher interest rates could lead to a liquidity dry up of venture capital - thus decreasing the exponential growth of AWS. * Google Cloud, Microsoft and others now offer them same as AWS, often at cheaper prices. * They will need to mark down Rivian next quarter -  which will significantly hurt their bottom line. Last quarter a lot of the "positive" suprise was due to the Rivian gain. * Higher competition in e-commerce, now nearly everyone offers quick shipping and often price matches.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-11 04:23:24'] Amazon already had the infrastructure in place to take advantage of the Covid tail winds and the increasing change to home delivery and work from home environments. But more and more companies are starting to develop their own competing businesses and now Amazon must defend their market share. In much the same way Amazon stole business away from brick and mortar small businesses and Walmart, there is risk that they are now in the same shoes Walmart was. The rich valuation and days of exponential growth may be slowing down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-11 00:33:24'] Id say $AMZN is doing great if compared to other online sellers of goods, like ebay, shopify, and clothing stores, the recent fall can be covered by the fact that amazon is trying to get into another spheres like improving drone delivery, actual stores without employees. Main Macro bear case would be  the Doubt in Rivian, since its pretty hard to get EV's coming out of the factories in just a couple years, and accomplishing such a thing would be very costly, we can see the doubt in them since now the market can is less than 25% of what it was at its all time highs.The other threat would be FEDEX trying out GM's EV's two minths ago they've bought 5000 delivery vehicles.Although fedex doesnt sell goods, only delivers them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-11 10:59:32'] Long term Amazon is solid. You’re probably best just waiting for the split and then using that as an opportunity to lower your price average
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-11 11:30:22'] Hold,  it'll have a stock split
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-11 14:25:51'] They have more exposure to fuel prices and labour costs when compared to other big tech companies. They've also just seen very strong cloud and ecommerce numbers from the pandemic so this year comps will likely be harder and we may be seeing some investors rotating out for that reason.I like AMZN. They have so many great products... Ecommerce, cloud, streaming, etc... I don't really understand why it's struggled so much the last few years. I think investors might be a little worried about what the change in CEO means for AMZN's future. I know people love to hate on Bezos but the dude build AMZN from the ground up and has continuously expanded the business into new areas for years. I worry that same drive for endless grow might not be there anymore, but even if it's not I don't think it's reason to be bearish. If AMZN just continues to dominate in ecommerce and cloud they'll do fine. AAPL underperformed when Tim Cook took over too, it took the market some time to feel sure the company was in good hands. Arguably you could point to MSFT and Ballmer as a reason to be a little cautious when a founder steps down as CEO.Who knows what's going to happen short-term, but they've got years of strong growth ahead of them with AWS (a product now CEO, Andy Jassy created alongside Bezos) and the stock is currently trading at it's lowest valuation in years. If there is a recession coming they'll be able to weather it and if the economy picks back up later this year the stock should start to recover along with it.As a shareholder I'm very comfortable with the price right now. I think the underperformance is just short-term macro-ecommerce concerns as you say.

Rocket Lab is starting to fill in that small satellite launch system role and is very cost efficient too.

Good dividend, great engineering history, chip demand isn’t going any where, still a ton of market share, it might take 5 years, but they’ll eventually overtake AMD again in raw speed and efficiency, and shit tons of money.  When they’re new fabs are online and producing, it gets exciting.  If they eve figure out dGPUs, watch the F out. I bet big on AMD when they were $20 a share (around the original ryzen announcement) because I saw them as getting Intel and nvidia in one company.Intel is like getting AMD and TSMC in one.Their big risks:  a major shift away from x86 industry wide (Intel is still better to handle this than AMD I believe). Another risk is actually getting the fabs up and running.I do think they need a new CEO.  Just back the brinks truck up for Dr Hsu and print the $.  Edit:  forgot they got  new ceo last year

Green Brick is a smaller homebuilder but are focused on 2 of the hottest markets (Dallas and Atlanta), have some of the best margins, and solid management that has been around for a long time.  DAQO is a Chinese solar company who hold over 100 patents, supply components for solar panels, healthy margins, and no debt.  I think they'll continue their double digit growth and while there is stiff competition, the patents are a nice safety blanket.

GDRX: competition fears are overblown and they have software-level margins. They got hammered because of a grocery store that broke their agreement but it was recently resolved. Saw my doctor recommending them just today. This is what I've been loading up on lately.CVRX: they have the only FDA approved device for a particular heart condition. They're just now accelerating their sales which was hampered down by Covid. I have more in this than with GDRX but if it ever gets to all time lows again, I'll load up some more.APPS: single tap mobile ads with growing partnerships. Cyclical industry but as cycles go, it'll come back around. Bought a small position hoping to accumulate more.PATH: I was skeptical about how much they could actually automate for a while but growth has been surprisingly robust. They're having trouble now due to revenue from countries with depreciating currencies and lost business in Russia. Those have nothing to do with the soundness of their business though so I'm looking to buy more on further dips.SOFI: I was skeptical about this one too for a while but that growth is real. I have a small position but I'll be buying on the dips.Maybe PLTR if it goes below $7 and bet on them getting more government contracts in the future because of conflicts that won't be resolved any time soon. Bought a ton of CBLT at current prices for a similar reason but with the spike in domestic crimes.

There can be huge innovation and good companies out there, but generally in inflationary market conditions (and i believe the fed will not win this battle so easily or quickly), the next decade doesn’t belong to tech. Probably lots of inflation punctuated by bouts of deflation. Just look at the 70s.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-19 15:31:54'] In the long term we are all dead. If you cannot see a path for a stock to double in 5 years, why bother? Find a company that can grow earnings 50% or more over 5 years. This requires that it's market grows that fast OR it takes market share. Taking market share is harder but plenty of companies have done it thought better products. Apple failed at PCs but certainly succeeded in phones. Netflix created he streaming industry. CRM created enterprise sales software. Hopefully, you can buy it for the average P/E (or P/S if no E yet) over the last 5 years or lower. After it doubles, re-evaluate where earnings are relative to your initial evaluation. If they have grown faster than you thought, you need to understand why before you sell but you should probably sell. If you are not willing to put at least this much thought into an idea, then buy index funds or mutual funds.

Some major chip companies also have decades of experience and hold most patent portfolio.All the small companies talk more than they can generate revenue. They may have developed a few software tools trying to pull trillions of data pieces together. But big ones have them for sometime now.This is a half a century old technology. It is the data mining part needing fresh data and crunch more data outcomes. The closest one was once Watson can be adapted and programmed for the task.  It fumbled. So was giant Google. It was not computer's fault. Rather the doctors who provided diagonosis the symptoms were feeding a bunch of biased data with blind spots. AI developer claimed 99% accuracy while the reality is way lower due to bad data provided. It worked on one patient and do not work on others. The AI tool became useless.  The little guys do not have the computing power. Nvda and others do. They can make claim until data fed in has flaws.  I think that is also the problem with self driving automobiles.

That process is way too slow compared to these giant pools of capital like Microsoft just getting them 10 billion like nothing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 20:41:30'] AI works as follows. Firstly you need a huge amount of data, then you build a model, then you train the model. The model is then deployed and acts like it is intelligent.The 'tools' you refer to are usually free. Massive open source tools like tensorflow are commonly used by most AI developers. Cloud providers like amazon can enhance this process by helping you... but even these companies will be using tensorflow etc.The data side is the barrier to entry. This is why any large company with lots of data can add value from AI. It is also why small companies and some new companies struggle to make an impact. Google, amazon, Microsoft, crowdstrike etc.Then you have training the model... and this is where Nvidia comes in. Its graphics cards are essential. They are basically the only player in town. I can't stress how essential their cards are.From the deployment perspective... I think some specific semiconductor companies provide chips (like lattice semiconductor) to help deployment.So.. thats why you end up with large cap tech... nvidia, Google, Microsoft, tesla etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 20:51:43'] honestly, finding a gem of an undiscovered AI company with stock available for purchase is going to require something akin to insider knowledge or at least a very intimate understanding in the unaddressed needs of a specific field.  I think it’s fair to say that without an incredibly unique and novel perspective, more companies you invest in will likely go belly up than will go parabolic. AI being a new topic is a double edged sword. On one side, it means there’s a boundless expanse of unexplored technology to discover with the potential of rapidly stealing market share from more traditional markets. But on the other side it means that any new discovery lacks the necessary framework of intellectual property that would prevent others from quickly designing a similar, better system and redistributing that market share yet again.

Those large companies. You're focused on companies like OpenAI, but that isn't really where the profit is. The profit comes from those who implement the AI into their business model to increase revenue, while lowering expenses.My personal pick is Amazon actually.

I've seen this happen with shit companies at every major market turn down"
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 08:43:36'] Have you looked at the nature of the debt? IE: What is Wayfair's interest expense? How many times over do normal earnings cover it?When do big portions of the debt come due? Is it fixed rate or variable?Simply saying a business carries a ton of debt means nothing.Berkshire is in the insurance reinsurance business and they carry a ton of debt, but it's very cheap debt and they earn a return on it.Charter (now Spectrum) is in the telecommunications business and they carry an astounding amount of debt. But it's almost all fixed cost, and they took it on when rates were much nearer to zero. At this point with interest rate hikes, a lot of the debt they own is, in practice, *paying them*. It's better than free.I don't know anything particular about Wayfair. Maybe everything you've said is right. But context is important.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 08:37:43'] The amount of debt is only one measure. When that debt is due and at what rate is the other. Companies can survive, even thrive with debt so long as the cash flows from their operations can make the debt payments. So I wouldn’t go nuts just over the dollar value of debt. With Wayfair, there may be some concern with a quick ratio that’s slightly under 1–which indicates that they may have trouble paying their obligations. However, again, this is just one measure and you probably need to look deeper into the balance sheet to really see how much trouble they’re in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 10:42:08'] They have a couple billion in liquidity, so that will keep them going for while.  You might be right eventually though.

You could do a bear put spread but don’t believe that the marker is liquid enough to make the trade efficiently. So, I would just watch it fall and do nothing, unless there are better ideas out there.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-09 13:20:28'] All their debt besides their revolving credit facility, which doesn’t appear to have any outstanding amount, are fixed rate. The next debt coming due is their 2024 convertible notes due in November of 2024, which is a little whiles away. Their current ratio seems sufficient, especially since a large portion is cash and short term investments. I don’t see them having liquidity issues within the next year, and beyond that depends more on how their business performs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-12 06:47:24'] I for one own 100 shares and just wrote 2 contracts for 85p on April 6. What does this mean? I took advantage or am hoping to take advantage of the pessimism and negative price movement on Amazon. I sold these contracts for $130 credit each, thus I received $260 to leverage 17,000 to Amazon until April 6. This is ~1.5% return on investment should Amazon not be under $85 on April 6.If Amazon goes under $85 then on April 6 I will be buying 200 shares for $85. However, if I subtract the $260 credit I got, it’s like I’m getting the shares for $83.70. Why am I doing this risk, I’m already comfortable holding shares here in the low 90s but I’ll gladly take more if it falls to 85. I’ll just decide to take some credit now instead of holding onto my money because I still think it won’t get that low.All of this to tell you just hold those 5 shares you have. Sure, it could drop another 7-10 and you may lose another $35-50 but Amazon is a longer term play. I’d look at it as a solid play in an account which may average around 5-10% per year gain but you could make some extra if you’re savvy writing options if you have enough $

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-12 05:53:47'] I was early on AMZN stock.  As in back before anyone had it or thought it would be viable.  Also had business relationship that meant direct contact with Bezos staff.  Lots of product to and from.  Told many people of it.  Well, I saw standards slipping a decade ago and gradually scaled completely away probably 5-6 years ago.  In recent years, customers are noticing the cracks and problems.  It's now an ad-laden, unusable flea market for counterfeit and offshore suppliers.  Delivery and customer service standards have imploded.  It's been forever since I heard a consumer-based positive, and it seems there's just one negative story after another.  I think pandemic spared and slowed their decline, but they're back on that same trajectoryPeople used to check out products locally and then order from Amazon.  That has almost flipped.  Businesses used to fear Amazon announcing a move into their space.  Now, they almost welcome it, because they'll be able to show how they're doing it better than bad big Amazon.  All of that said, the counter case is that most of the big bombed out stocks that have had huge rallies in the last year have had similar horrible narratives and sick prognoses.  So maybe AMZN will copy what's happened with NVDA, TSLA, META, CRM, NFLX.  All of those were considered walking dead, and frankly none of them has actually made any kind of significant change or announcement to deserve their 60 to 100+% rebounds.  These names and others just had to string two or even one tempting tale and the bulls took it from there.  Netflix "customers hate us but now we're going to sell ads and don't look too closely at our plans because we have none and oops we had to refund the advertisers and next our plan to to bug our customers and call them thieves"Tesla - our pathological owner maybe be getting more pascistic by the day, but he now says he's going to stop dumping stock (maybe) and we're slashing prices because we're the only car company somehow building up inventory right now."Nvidia - we can't gouge on the price of our videogame chips by calling them crypppt products anymore, so now we'll call them AI chips.Meta - we'll stop talking about our silly avatar world vision so much, and we'll fire a bunch of the people who had nothing to do with it.  And so on.  So all AMZN really needs to do is say one or two things the market wants to hear.  They don't even have to be necessarily great or even true.  Announce big layoffs or say they're cutting back on lord of the rings spending, maybe announce a new CEO that's not like an NPC.  Say they're turning delivery logistics over to AI.  Or possibly the biggest thing, say they're segmenting the Chinese/counterfeit goods off to a separate website and "consulting" with Bezos to bring the web store back to something more trustworthy and customer friendly.  The stock wouldn't even wait for them to actually do these things.  Just the whiff of them maybe happening would spark it up.  Even just someone there admitting they've lost their their way and that the pizza tastes like cardboard, that alone could revive the stock.

Don't buy anything you wouldn't want to own forever and just hold it unless it really doesn't make sense anymore. Amazon is a massive company with growth prospects. I doubt you lose money on that position if you just wait. I have a couple positions that I'm down like 80% on right now and I'm still just holding them because I think it can come back eventually. Individual stocks are volatile. If it bothers you to look at that, maybe go index funds and just hold them until retirement.

POST_TEXT: b"Just a random thought I had... Amazon was previously seen as a Covid stock since they had huge increases in revenue due to online shopping. The stock almost doubled after March 2020 due to higher expectations for e-commerce. \n\nHowever, Amazon hasn't really managed to turn that extra revenue into profit. Quite the opposite. They've continuously had worse and worse cash flows as they had to invest a lot of money in fulfillment. Now e-commerce is slowing down and they have all these extra resources/workers that have to work their way through the Amazon system. It seems like maybe profitability is going to be even more unpredictable in their retail section. So compared to pre-covid, their retail operations seem a bit less predictable and profitable. \n\nPlus, this is anecdotal, but I feel like I've been hearing more and more complaints about Amazon. Delivery times were really long during Covid, and there are more and more advertisements and knockoff goods pushed to the top of the page. Seems"

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-13 07:59:54'] They might've screwed up but my guess is they are reinvesting in themselves.  The thing is, with COVID coming around not only did online shopping increase but lots of people got used to the idea that they can just sit back and order things to their home.  Old timers who swore by the brick and mortar stores are scared to return because of the fear created by the media and the worry of their lives at risk.  Lots of people swayed towards online ordering now and even if they didn't capitalize during COVID that new ideology will be around for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-13 08:08:14'] Amazon is a cloud company with a retail component, anyone investing doesn't care too much about that part anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-13 08:03:34'] They are still the fastest and cheapest online seller out there. If you want your purchase any faster, you’ve got to go out and buy it in person yourself. You risk paying a lot for gas and/or getting involved in a mass shooting if you go that route. Amazon can manage costs by laying off fulfillment and delivery workers if need be. The biggest risk to Amazon’s financial condition is unions.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-13 14:08:55'] One important thing to remember is that Covid also brought about a change in the Amazon CEO. I haven't been nearly as impressed with Jassy thus far as I was with Bezos. I think they'll be fine long-term thanks to AWS, but they were unprepared for the logistics strain of Covid, so were forced to spend way too much on labor and infrastructure. Their competitors took advantage of the situation to set up their own e-commerce options. I feel like Amazon didn't take advantage of the situation as well as they could've, and that blame has to be aimed at the management. I don't believe Amazon's ATH was in 2021, but I do think they will underperform relative to other mega-cap tech companies unless they can find a way to better convert their e-commerce revenue into profit.

Given that the wages at Amazon in Alabama are $15/hour (roughly 2x the legal minimum wage in the state) do you think that had a measurable impact on the results of the vote (employees voting for immediate over long term interests)?  Do you think this will be repeated (and have a better chance of succeeding) in a state with higher minimum wage laws?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 10:50:13'] If the unionization vote passes, Amazon would probably just shut down the facility as punishment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 08:28:23'] Is it at all possible that the people there simply don't want to unionize? I keep seeing theories which are honestly just all over the place as to how Amazon is hijacking the vote or they must be manipulating them. 15$ an hour isnt bad money in Alabama, and they pay that here in Louisiana too, where its good money as well. Stack benefits on that and its even better a job than most around here, where you can still see loads of jobs paying less than 10 an hour. It just seems like the people most outraged are the people who dont even work for the company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 09:58:47'] I didn't know much about unions before joining one in my field. It turned out to be a huge mistake and I regret it immensely. In my case, my union just wanted my money. It cost me $8,000 to join, plus $1,000 annual contributions. They created obstacles for me finding and getting work. The worst part was that there were a few times that they prevented me from making money that was rightfully mine.So yeah, I had a really bad experience in my field. Many people in my field hate the union or simply regard it as a necessary evil from which they receive little to no benefit. I never really hear any speak highly of our union (Local 600, Film Production).I understand it's not that way for everyone though, even within the same industry as me (film production has a few different unions depending upon your job), and I'm happy for those whom it benefits. I don't blame the Amazon workers for voting against it though. I think they know very well what their best interests are and I find it arrogant that anyone would suggest otherwise. As history has shown, unions can be just as big of swindlers as their corporate counterparts.

In my opinion one of the biggest factors of success for a union are whether it is in a right to work state or not. Because when a union is optional most of the younger people fail to see the benefit do not opt in and the older do see the benefit and pay dues. What happens is that is the union negotiates contracts for the whole company while trying to do what is best for their due paying members. This from what I have seen leads to younger people not liking the union.

Call the electrician, but first call the sheet metal guy to remove the cover blocking the lightbulb.This is why cars are 50k+ and businesses move out of the country.But 140k a year (with OT) keeps me from going insane though still get upset and wonder how much skillful I would be if I worked at say Tesla or another Non union plantEdit - expect your packages to show up late or incorrect more than they do now if this goes through.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 08:23:18'] Lmao too poor to unionize. Amazon and the lack of a social safety net got these people so afraid of losing their jobs if they unionize, that they effectively said “fuck any bargaining power if it risks my job.”It blows because they could have better work conditions. Additionally, we know that the government won’t intercede on behalf of labor because America is a capitalist country. It is built only to facilitate the accumulation of wealth due to circumstance of birth. That circumstance typically being race and socioeconomic status. Oh well. That’s the way the cookie crumbles.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 10:06:37'] Fuck the union ....it’s the downfall of this country

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 09:20:48'] Amazon workers voting not to unionize?! Nothing more masochistic can be imagined.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 13:50:24'] Let me get this straight.1. We want jobs in America.2. We want to be paid the highest and most benefits.3. We want to have the right to not be fired (assuming valid dispute).4. We want you (Amazon) to invest in the jobs by spending millions building everything out so we can work.5. We want a Union so you won't screw us either.Got it. I mean........ does this make sense for any company that is trying to maximize profits?And if you tell me you Companies should maximize profits but instead have lower profits to socially help people... then.... I don't think most of the world is for you. Maybe go live in a secluded area.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 10:05:28'] All they do is issue letters stating why unions are bad and how they Amazon are looking out for you with competitive blah blah.They basically are using psychology against their employees you can’t trust them. What ever is the union it is at least not Amazon. At worst you have shitty pay bad work conditions and no future.  No different than now.Man it must feel so amazing to make billions and hate paying as well as treating your employees like people not cogs.Fuck America for not stepping in on these tactics that big companies use to manipulate outcomes. What a sad country.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:50:40'] most people lost trust in unions and want nothing to do with them
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 08:39:05'] The Union has announced they'll be filing with the NLRB about what they view as unfair labor practices. This fight is far from over.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 18:43:00'] Rigged.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 12:23:08'] Can anyone tell me what Unionization means?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 15:24:24'] Zero impact.This decision would have had zero positive upside for AMZN and the stock if it went the other way.  There would have been collective (versus individual) bargaining which would result in higher wages/benefits for the worker, increasing the operating expenses of the company.  As such, the decision to unionize would have had a detrimental impact upon the AMZN stock.Did the AMZN stock "bake in" the potential downside of a pro-Union vote?  I don't think so.As such, it's the same position for AMZN as last year to last week to tomorrow.  No Union and no material impact upon operating expenses.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:39:13'] I wonder how easy it is to set up a new warehouse. Not just for Amazon, in general. Warehouses in this area of Alabama seem to have entry wages start much lower than Amazon, even unionized warehouses. However they also seem more selective at a glance. Amazon seems to recruit more from other fields. Retail, recent high school graduates, and so on. Their point of comparisons and expectations might be different from the usual warehouse industry of their locality and thus have different expectations in multiple ways, or desire for reform. Though I've heard Amazon also expects harder work for a higher salary. Not sure if that's true or not, other people who work at warehouses sometimes claim Amazon's no different from the average warehouse, but maybe they came from the lower end warehouses.It's hard to balance limited resources and expected motivation. Motivation is especially tricky. Some people want to be motivated, focused and driven. But wanting it and actually being it to a mild or even high degree is different.I think unions offer benefits, but also potential risks. Best case it helps the worker and potentially the business, higher salary, easier work, better hours, and maybe more efficient work.  Worst case its another layer of bureaucracy, and the union heads like any leadership position has risk of abuse of power, corruption, nepotism, etc. Some unions charge heavy fees or dues to work any job or even hold a title in the industry, and the bad ones might not give a tangible benefit for those monetary costs and physical restrictions on individual freedom to choose jobs/work. Plus promotion paths. Some dislike promotion paths weighing more on years worked, instead of quality of work. Someone with 20 years experience doing poor work gets more promotions and higher pay/control/leadership posts than someone with 5 years experience who works hard in some systems. That's worst case for it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 17:56:15'] I guess redditors dont know what's better for workers.. And ehh,  Amazon workers no bitching from now
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-09 16:07:38'] I think the should be allowed to unionize, having worked for amazon I can see why they'd need the protection and of course the irritation of the company spending it's time and money trying to intimidate, possibly illegally so but probably just barely not, and maybe even rig the votes to prevent the worst thing to happen to them, workers get the rights to force better working environments by jumping in bed with questionable and hardly corrupt free unionization.

POST_TEXT: b'Amazons big annual sale, Prime Day, will return on July 12 and 13, announced Thursday.\n\nThe event is also a significant revenue driver for other retail sites, often offering competing discounts to consumers. Last year, total e-commerce sales during the two-day shopping event topped $11 billion, according to Adobe Analytics. That figure was even slightly higher than Cyber Monday totals in 2020, representing 24 hours rather than a 48-hour one.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/16/amazon-prime-day-2022-runs-july-12-and-13.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/16/amazon-prime-day-2022-runs-july-12-and-13.html) \n\n**Amazon AMZN said its annual Prime Day shopping event would be held from July 12 to 13.**\n\n**Last years Prime Day event generated an estimated $3.5 billion sales.** \n\n**AMZN is currently down 3.70%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 06:46:15'] maybe? does one or two bullish days matter in this market?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 06:50:05'] Prime day in a bearish market still a bearish
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:01:04'] I don’t see how people will be spending more than, or even as much, as they have in the past.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:01:04'] no there’s nothing that’s going to overcome the macroeconomic environment just get your money to the sidelines and hang tight for a bit
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:16:03'] Prime day doesn't really offer good deals now.  They did in the past but its been years since then.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 06:47:47'] Stimmy dried up, sentiment at low, don't see how they surpass last year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:52:56'] See it actually being bearish. When the numbers come up it's likely that it won't show growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:10:19'] Fuck no. A lot of customers in past years have been getting fed up with Prime day anyway; the deals just aren’t that good and a lot of the products on sale are junk.Not to mention a looming recession and tightening consumer spending. PD will fall flat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 06:54:27'] People love to shop on Amazon
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:33:09'] Times are over where such a non-event would pump a stock…
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:18:04'] They have Prime Day every year.  How is the fact that the next one is coming up relevant to the entirety of all Amazon profits over the entire life of the company?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 07:12:40'] Ha!   The only thing that matters now is the prime rate.    The value of earnings in the future is dropping every day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:24:01'] They are going to have to have some killer deals to pull people in imo. Usually its just crap thats been sitting inthe warehouse for a year that wont move. Considering they say the retail side isnt a money maker for them, I dont see it being a stock mover, even though they will tout X sales on the day. Would love to see something I actually want to buy for once, but I wont be holding my breath.  Either they want sales and  put out some good deals - that wont make them money, or they push out the usual crap, and see less people spending this year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:28:57'] It’s been years since prime day was worth a damn. Now with bidenflation, gas pushing $6 and groceries 30% more and rising. Prime day is a non event.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 10:08:31'] No, not this year.  Prime Day has become full of cheap dumpster electronics that wouldn't be sold at Dollar General.  There's a few doorbuster style items to get eyes in the door.  Best deals are typically when non-house brands offer 25% off their entire product line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 12:04:03'] no, markets suckoverall. who cares about this day
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:12:58'] FFS. Just rename this sub to r/amazonstock and get over with it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 08:47:20'] An event they’ve hosted every year for like ever…. No. It’s already baked into their expectations unless something crazy good happens.
