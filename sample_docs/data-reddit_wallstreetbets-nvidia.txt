	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:00:36'] Hopefully he shorted
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:25:26'] He also named his dog Nvidia
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:47:37'] And now he is bullish as fuck
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:22:17'] Nvidia was down 23% that month in 2022.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:07:08'] Technically he wasn't wrong in the short term, it fell another 20 dollars
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:53:36'] Whats his advice about NVDA now?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:27:44'] At some point WSB is going to realize his goal is to get us on the wrong side of MMs trades.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:38:09'] Guys, we really need a Inverse Cramer ETF. I' m gonna put all my money in it and just go about my life.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 15:02:26'] WSB: "NVDA is an over priced piece of shit.Also WSB: "lol Cramer, what a moron for talking shit about NVDA"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:08:15'] Obviously the time to short is right after they pump the stock on pie-in-the-sky revenue ‚Äúestimates‚Äù but before they sell billions of shares on the open market and definitely before they issue revenue guidance revisions down about 40% from initial ‚Äúguidance‚Äù.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 14:38:07'] Is there a stock portfolio which just buys and sells the opposite of what Kramer says? That seems like safe money and I want to invest into that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:23:05'] Makes sense
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:31:18'] That guy is just vicious and pumps up his friends. He probably had a pal competing against them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:56:19'] You could probably make huge money in the market doing the exact opposite of what this guy says
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:04:42'] I made the mistake of listening to him once, after that, I listen to him and do the opposite.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:23:51'] Cramer never actually shorted it. I.e. he says shit he doesn't do.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:52:48'] But, but, but. He said he knew 5 years ago when he talked to Jenson Huang that he was a visionary. That's all he ever says now. He KNEW NVIDIA was going to change the world.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:53:20'] If Cramer was scored according to his picks, it would be worse than the worst baseball at bat average.    He's all show

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 14:46:40'] How many times will this ü§° be wrong before people stop paying attention to him?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 15:03:26'] He‚Äôs been bullish for the past few months. He completely changed his stance after meeting with the NVDA CEO. If you listened to his show and his input on NVDA, you actually would‚Äôve made bank.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 16:25:31'] I watch the opening bell every morning on CNBC and every day I watch this coked-up joker doing his analysis. How is he still on TV? He‚Äôs cringe x10.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:21:25'] He has to have an agenda. He‚Äôs wrong on a consistent basis. Trying to get the public to do one thing so he or ‚Äòthey‚Äô can do the opposite
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:23:22'] Jim Cramer is a highly regarded trader.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:32:36'] I bought in July 2022 and am only up 112% - porque?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 21:21:24'] In fairness though, the stock did fall by 20 points over the next four weeks before shooting back up almost 280.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 06:32:32'] But it did drop to $83
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 06:46:25'] Man, when it was at $116 I was like imma buy $5000 worth‚Ä¶I did not. So frustrating!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:44:42'] real question, how long has Cramer actually been this dumb?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:46:33'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:36:42'] At this point he is doing it intentionally, sending some sort of signals to all of us
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:18:49'] I get the feeling he is privy to insider information and trying to steer us into the other side of his trades.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 16:52:47'] It's Jim Cramer. Of course he's wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:41:24'] If there will be ever a reason to leave this sub it's because of the meaningless spam posts about Jim Cramer. Its not funny anymore, we know he's a loser.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:09:59'] I have my doubts about anything Jim says.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:54:51'] If I had enough money and paitence, I would be millionare by just doing exact opposite of what he says and nothing else. Paid Shill - this guy is the biggest paid shill ever.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:45:36'] Does anyone else think it's possible these things are done intentionally? His record is so spotlessly wrong it's almost inconceivable he could eff up this many picks. It's really astounding.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 14:52:35'] Mmm this isn‚Äôt the full clip. I hate to say it, but this is one of few names that he has been right about. Cramer loves NVDA more than any other stock out there. This is fake news.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:50:43'] I don't understand how Cramer is on TV talking about stocks. Isn't this public manipulation or something ? How can he give advice on what to do with stocks on TV?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:14:08'] Uh you are better off with a coin flip.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:20:30'] I cannot stand this guy. I just wanna punch him in the face. With a brick. Multiple times.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:22:06'] Didn't he name his dog Nvidia?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:24:53'] This guy is just amazing
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:34:38'] As a rule, I don't watch Cramer for fear of rapidly depleting my total brain cell count. With that said, we need a real-time Cramer prediction/opinion tracker. Dude is literally the anti-Nostradamus![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:15:00'] ...and it turned around 3 weeks after that right after the launch of the 4090 and 4080 on October 12th.Nvidia is a stock that people always regret selling. Softbank vision fund bailed on it before it shot up, Cramer did this bullshit, Cathie Wood bailed on it before it rocketed... Andrew Left spent an entire year shitting on it before the crypto mining boom.The company charges a lot for their shit and they act like divas but they make decent shit that people will need more and more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:24:28'] ok it's funny but if it is so far behind today I don't think this is extremely fair. I like the joke when he clearly makes short-term "calls" that turn out to be incorrect.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:25:22'] How does this oracle get his info? This is insane
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:25:32'] Now he's bullish on NVDA, so it might spike and then free fall
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:29:29'] The poor guy, how on earth is he able to hold on to his job with all the bad advises he makes, I mean his bosses must be completely clueless about investing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:29:38'] yeah, almost half a yr ago‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:30:14'] whether he's right or wrong, we should stop giving him any attention.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:36:12'] In fairness he has changed his tune all year long though, basically sucking off Jensen's nutsack. You haven't been paying attention.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 13:47:04'] Stupid post. It went down after he called that, and we have had an AI bubble form well after he said that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 15:28:16'] Now the question is when is he going to become bullish on NVDA? I need my sell indicator!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 15:28:26'] If he were psychic he wouldn't need a TV show
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 15:33:18'] He obviously meant that his future-self is a loser for not longing Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 15:34:54'] I reckon one can do pretty well doing the exact opposite of what this clown says.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 15:49:46'] There is a loser in this video ...and it's not nvidia!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 17:41:41'] It's too coincidental that he's wrong this much, he's playing mind games with his viewers. Probably does the opposite of what he says everytime How the fuck is he still on air?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 17:44:30'] He didn‚Äôt say for how long to short it
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 17:47:44'] Considering how counter indicative he is to the market constantly, there's likely other factors at play than the recommendation.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 18:46:27'] Cramers a trader.....not investor.   Firstly.... Any recommendation he makes is only considered immediate  short-term play.  You do have to know when to exit as well as enter..... That's somebody's personal responsibility... Yeah I understand he's still wrong frequently...but that gives nobody the right to take his recommendations out of context. He doesn't say ride this biatch into the ground..... If you do lose a couple of percent you should know you got to get out.  Likewise, he tells you if you make a gain to take something off the table. Of course with some stocks you're leaving good money on the table, so be it.    Pigs get fat Hogs...  get slaughtered.Trading for a living is about making small percentage gains more consistently than small percentage losses.  It's not about making big wins.... Or gambling and hoping to get lucky

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 22:48:54'] So if you think about it, if you just picked random things. Markets typically move up and even by chance day today let's just say there's a 50/50 chance it's going to go up or down. So how do over 90% of retail traders lose money? Oh that's right people listen to the news, financial advice from the "professionals" ü§£As someone who eventually became a profitable trader, there's two things I'll share that really help. The first one is you have to think about Wall Street like a giant game of liars poker. You don't really know if people are giving you decent advice or if they are just trying to manipulate you for their own means which more times than not is what's going on. The second one is if you watch the movements of the markets long enough you begin to anticipate what's going to happen. At no point have I ever found financial news helpful in what they are saying. It's also worth noting a lot of the financial YouTube channels are literally paid to promote various things and steer the audience in the direction the paid promoter wants them to go

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 23:48:21'] What I learned is don't trust people who say they know about stocks. In December of 2019 I was going to short Ford stock and I was going to make a huge profit but my nephew told me Ford would never fall under $4. I believed him so I didn't do it a week later Ford stock hit $2.50. Another time I invested in Amd when it was $5 it was going up and then it crashed and a coworker told me yeah just sell it it never goes higher than $50. Well I sold it and a day later it hit $120. From that day forward I have not trusted anyone with my stock predictions.

Likely gonna chuck another 10k or 20k to get the position size to $200k sometime soon.___**Current NVDA stats:*** Currently trading at $229.65 per share, $567B market cap* Up +60% YTD, +112% from 52-week lows hit in Oct 2022* Analysts median price target: $265* Analysts ratings: 26 Buy (63.4%), 13 Hold (31.7%), 2 Sell (4.8%)* Short-interest: 1.57%**Condensed DD/Brief Thesis:*** Nvidia is at a $567B valuation with a 131 P/E.* It's P/E is far greater than it was during any period of time in it's history. Well above anything that occurred during ZIRP. For reference, it's current P/E is >30% higher then it's 2021 peak (\~100 P/E) hit in Nov 2021. A period where equities across the board were hitting sky high P/E valuations, GPU's were flying off the shelves, crypto hit an all-time high of $2.9T, and rates were 0%.This suggests it's being modeled for extreme growth, but:* The Inflation Reduction Act dramatically [increases Nvidia's tax liability](https://tax.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CAMT-estimate.pdf) starting in 2023, due to a new 15% Corporate AMT. Nvidia has paid 1.9% effective tax or less in recent years, even having a negative annual tax (-$0.187B) for 2022. Among the lowest in the S&P 100.* Revenue & earnings have been going down significantly while operating expenses are rising. From their most recent Q4 earnings:|Revenue|\-21%||:-|:-||Expenses|\+27%||Gross Margin|\-2.1 pts||Operating Expenses|\+50%||Operating Income|\-58%||Net Income|\-53%||Cashflow from Operations|\-55%||Free Cash Flow YoY|\-53%|Even if the bullish analysts forecasted revenue growth projections (\~18-20%) for 2023 became true, Nvidia will not make more revenue in 2023 than they did in 2021. Let alone earnings, due to increased operating expenses and taxes.* High rates act against spending growth, and make the equity-risk premium less attractive as bond become a viable alternative.* Failing banks in the tech (Silicon Valley Bank) & crypto (Silvergate) space disproportionately impact their primary customer base. Lack of available capital in growth tech point towards a reduction in spending.

With 185k at 22, you will easily be a multimillionaire by the time you are able to withdraw penalty free at 59.5 investing in fucking SPY. Time is your friend and you got A LOT of it. Personally I‚Äôm mid 30s and got 175k Roth IRA in a dividend etf. Conservative estimates have me getting over 100k/year tax free in dividends by the time I‚Äôm 59.5 without contributing an additional cent. I ran some #s and if you went all in SCHD, you‚Äôd be able to get over 400k in dividends per year by the time you reach 59.5 (without contributing additional $)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 14:27:51'] I don't understand why someone would do this at 22 with retirement accounts.  You could just max them out for the next 20 years and probably have over a million dollars playing it safe.  You could put extra cash in a taxable account to make some plays.  You could actually use that money whenever you wanted to without penalties.  I wish I had amassed $185k at 22.  I'd have been set for retirement.I guess people here are truly regarded.  I also don't have 185k at 37 though so maybe I'm regarded.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 05:25:56'] She probably feels like she needs to be more "clever" than just buying NVidiaIt's like personal trainers at the gym can't just have you doing squats/deadlift/bench pressthey need to make it seem real smart and complicated.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 05:40:36'] She is a portfolio manager, its the responsible thing to do. Euphoria will wane off and reality will set in. There is also a risk that congress starts to limit and restrict AI with new laws, limiting its capabilities. forward revenue guidance is $11B for the quarter. That's about $44B per year.

A lot of places don‚Äôt need gpus currently to run most services. However when the capabilities of AI do become integrated into tech who do you think they will buy from? Maybe buy further out calls or the stock outright. Buying puts on this in the Longview of things is like putting Apple when they just showcased the first ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù. Stay bullish my friend but in less risky and smarter ways. Meta, Goog, MSft and amd also recommended.

BTW they lost the console market by fucking over MSFT with the first gen Xbox. Nvidia decided that making the GPU for the OG xbox was not the best way to make money (read margins were low) and just straight up decided not to make enough.Nvidia made a lot of enemies over the years, and very few outside the industry sees them as they are. Greedy, soulless corporate bullies.

Only chat gpt is useful and better than Google search in some aspects.It works like this ;Many loss making  "tech" companies are run with investors money and simply collect data. They have tons of it.Before they were milking investors by building AI model forever. Now they demo chat gpt and claim they will build something like it and milk more money In process.I believe all this rage Abt Nvidia will run only for one cycle.At the most till next earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 20:28:58'] 4060 is very underwhelming for the price. Linus told me so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 04:43:47'] You can make many arguments that NVDA is currently overvalued but this is the dumbest one. Hardly anyone games on PCs in Japan and we also saw that most of NVDA's revenue comes from their AI server data chips. Their gaming revenue, which I believe still beat, is just a small part of their total revenue.This is why a wide moat is good.Also, the entire PC community hates this new 4060ti's specs for the price, but again, gaming might as well not even be NVDA's focus at this point. It's all about making chips for AI for businesses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 10:24:47'] Tesla Dojo is specific for their use cases which is training large models based on video data. It also does not exist yet, and won‚Äôt be useful for training large language models. The only alternative right now is Google TPUs and Nvidia has at least a 6x lead on them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 09:36:16'] The real opportunity here is not to short nvidia. Nvidia is going to take his big daddy gpu order with 90% margin to chip makers and chip makers have limited amount of wives. They will let nvidia fuck their wives and deprioritize other bulls. That means everyone using the same chip makers as nvidia will struggle more to fullfill orders and will likely see their margin drop. Which fabless swinger has the least margin right now? Thats qcom and they will get floored soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:00:10'] >I believe that Nvidia is currently in a bubble. While the company has seen great success in recent years, I think its current valuation is inflated and not sustainable in the long term. The main reason I believe this is because of how quickly the company has grown and how reliant it is on continued growth to maintain its high stock price. If growth slows down or stops altogether, investors will lose confidence and sell off their shares, leading to a sharp decline in share value.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:43:56'] Sell. Ai is glorified google search. Overhyped.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:58:24'] In hind site we all wish we loaded up on AAPL 10-20 years ago.  In 20 years we will look back at NVDA and other AI the same way.  It‚Äôs the next wave.  Ride it.  Sure it will pull back on occasion. It‚Äôs not a fluke.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:45:51'] Doesn't matter, just inverse this subs majority opinion
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:13:12'] We had months of ChatGPT talk, MSFT investment into OpenAI, increased public interest and companies cornered into answering ‚Äúwhat are you doing with AI‚Äù and a bunch of analysts saying ‚Äúbuy NVDA‚Äù because they are the leader for this new space: fast forward, people snapping up their stock and their products.  Most of that increased revenue next quarter is coming from investments in CapEx from companies like MSFT and AMZN because now they have to ramp up spending for all this new interest.   Here is the kicker, not all AI tech companies will benefit, MSFT and AMZN have to spend more than they expected now, MSFT and others will not allow NVDA to dominate this hardware space longer term and will quickly ‚Äúbuild their own‚Äù.   They already started.  Look at how fast MSFT built MS-Teams and then outpaced the company Slack.  So do you think NVDA has an insurmountable moat that justifies current growth rates like this for longer that 2023/2024?    NVDA needs to be at over 30b per quarter sustained to come close to looking reasonable from a Market cap perspective.  In addition, you think other chip companies will get these kinds of growth rates during this time?    Short answer, No!   AI is too hyped already.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:46:46'] Long, most analyst price target is near 500 range. If it can deliver 11b next quarter, it is definitely another 30% rise day.Debt ceiling agreement reached, unemployment remain super low, the economy is so resilient against rate hike. The sentiment has never been better
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:13:20'] It appeared to me that NVDA was in a bubble pre earnings. The earnings beat and guidance were a great step towards justifying its valuation. But then, it shot up another 30%. So I say, it‚Äôs still in a bubble. I believe that by the time NVDA ramps up manufacturing enough to produce the revenue it needs to justify its valuation, there will be competitors eating into its market share. I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think any chipmaker is special enough to corner the market forever.I don‚Äôt see it talked about enough, but can anyone comment on Nvidia‚Äôs intellectual property? Is their software sticky enough that their clients will not consider alternative hardware *at any price delta*? Is there something so unique and patented about their hardware that competitors will be forced to license the tech from NVDA to offer an alternative product?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:05:31'] Nvidia is strong as shit! Yes its overbought af but so as tesla was. Yes we will see some declines and big volatility but in a long run its a win. Traders be aware and may be stick to something more stable and clear
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:43:52'] Definetly guidance is not made up. At least not for an almost $1t company like Nvidia. Maybe for other ai centered companies that don't have the competitive mote like Nvidia has.  Moving from a 7bill forward guidance to 11bill is unheard of for a company like Nvidia hence the massive price move.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 00:50:23'] It's a momentum trade now. If it clears 400, then we could see 500 and so on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:21:02'] The chips used in AI are no magic. It‚Äôs not that Nvidia has a design that could not be replicated by someone else. They manufacture most of them at TSMC, meaning they pay a premium to allocate high end processes there. Similar to Apple, relying on the most advanced technology to produce their custom chips. I doubt the cloud AI partnership. Offering these big machine learning farms is an investment risk and might have short product cycles, depending on the evolution of ML hardware design. Both Amazon and Google and certainly Microsoft as well focus very heavily on optimizing their data centers regarding power consumption and cooling. I personally cannot imagine they will suddenly buy billions of NVidia chips. Personally I also don‚Äôt like to call it AI, but stick to machine learning. Nothing we have seen hyped up has a big commercial roadmap. Please read that again. Yes, everyone is hyped up about machine learning and training big models, creating art, optimization in product design,  but you need to be able to sell these services. In my opinion Nvidia is way too optimistic here. Not because it‚Äôs not impressive technology, but creating a business model that allows them to penetrate cloud offerings or even consumer products. They will eventually succeed, but not in the ways currently predicted. People forget companies like Nokia, Research In Motion or even Enron. Greed, limits in innovation and high expectations can kill the revenue of a company very very quickly. Nvidia is great, but current market evaluations are a fantasy. Just my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:49:17']  NVDA is the most unstoppable stock and I would not bet against it no matter what the metrics say. It is the embodiment of AI hopes for the market and until that enthusiasm declines the stock will never meaningfully decline

TSMC is aiming to increase its CoWoS capacity from 8,000 wafers per month to 20,000 wafers per month by the end of 2024, but even this expanded capacity is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the needs of Nvidia and AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 11:09:27'] >This is great news for TSMC and its shareholders. The demand for advanced packaging solutions is clearly growing, and TSMC is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. Nvidia appears to be the primary driver of this demand, with AMD also benefiting from the increased adoption of complex multi-chiplet designs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:29:35'] Doesn‚Äôt really matter, cutting edge micro-electronics manufacturing has always been like this. Either a company doesn‚Äôt need cutting edge and they can find a reliable supply or they do and they will pay the (crazy) market rate.TSMC is the big dog rn, so their production capacity is their capacity nothing more nothing less.Although this conversation I think does a good job of illuminating how difficult it is to make exponential improvements in the semi-conductor industry. Things will only get harder from here, less and less companies will be able to compete with the new hotness and the rate technology advances will reduce over time.Just the fact that TSMC can make even a single one of these products is a fucking miracle. This is the pinnacle of human ability right now, and depending on how Taiwan goes forever. It‚Äôs going to be difficult. Don‚Äôt count on continued exponential growth in this space fr

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 14:40:15'] Nvidia is so highly valued now that it will likely become a stock that is extremely sensitive to broader market conditions. If SPY goes up 0.3%, NVDA will rip 2% and the same will be true for a red day. It is also subject to complete collapse for no concrete reason at any moment. Could rip another 20%, could tank back to October lows. The risk is certainly to the downside but whatever happens, it will move to the right.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 15:04:02'] They're basically defined by the markets they're used in. Previously they were overvalued because crypto. Now they're overvalued because AI.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 11:09:57'] Basically, unless something big happens NVDA will keep chugging along. What most likely will happen is that NVDA's earning will be bad, and guidance will be underwhelming. They'll say AI several times, but it might not pump the stock. Then a couple of days later, a "leak" will occur saying they partnered with AAPL or some company to develop AI chip and then it will soar to the moon. Gotta max pain and max gain the retails.Edit: In direct answer to your question, not really. NVDA is the leading manufacturer of GPU and will likely never be toppled. The only way it could get toppled is if Intel actually does a MSFT and had a project in the making take insane leaps and bound (like ChatGPT) and become the forefront of it. Otherwise, unlikely to see NVDA have a fall of grace.Will there be a correction to its stock value sometime in the future? **ABSOLUTELY!** Will it collapse from market leadership like BlackBerry? Very very unlikely.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 11:01:18'] >There are definitely some signs that NVIDIA could fall behind in the near future. Firstly, their focus on gaming chipsets means that they could be caught off-guard by a new competitor who focuses on AI or other cutting-edge technologies. Secondly, NVIDIA's current business model is based on selling high-end GPUs to consumers and businesses; however, if cheaper alternatives from AMD or Intel become available, this could eat into NVIDIA's market share. Finally, it is worth noting that although NVIDIA has been a leader in the GPU space for many years, there is no guarantee that this will continue indefinitely ‚Äì newer companies may come up with better products or pricing models which could undercutNVIDIA's dominance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 12:51:03'] I can‚Äôt say if the current price is overvalued or not but I will say I recently built a high end PC specifically for AI work and NVIDIA was basically the only choice because they were miles ahead of their competition. When their 50 series GPU‚Äôs hit I‚Äôll definitely be upgrading again no matter what the cost, even if my current card is still performing well.Gamers obviously would have no need for that which is who the rest of the industry is competing for. So I think NVIDIA is going to do amazingly well long term if they continue on this path.

POST_TEXT: b"Not financial advice!\n\nNvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regards opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.\n\nSo Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.\n\nIt's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's "

Let's look at some recent news and why we should keep our diamond hands ready.\n\nNvidia had an absolute barnburner of a year in 2023. The share price has more than doubled, with the company's market valuation hitting an astronomical $940bn (760bn). After a fantastic early trading session that saw the share price rise by 25%, the stock topped out at $385.84 a share. Nvidia is riding the wave of AI demand, specifically for generative AI products like ChatGPT, which require massive data centers packed with their semiconductor chips.\n\nNvidia recently reported Q2 revenues of $7.2bn, smashing Wall Street's predictions by 10%. The company also made an ambitious forecast of $11bn in revenues for Q3, which is more than 50% higher than Wall Street's estimate of $7.2bn. Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities sa"

POST_TEXT: b"Investing in shovels for gold miners is like betting on a unicorn riding a rainbow while juggling pineapples - a surefire win! These shovels, however, aren't just ordinary spades, but rather glittering tools of wonder like NVIDIA's A100 GPUs, ASML's magic lithography wands, and TSMC's almighty hammer of semiconductor creation.  \n\nBut wait! The high price-to-earnings ratios and market capitalizations of these companies might seem like clouds in the sky of your financial prosperity. But fear not, for these companies have built walls as strong as a castle made of jellybeans, guarded by dragons made of cotton candy.  For instance, NVIDIA's GPUs are like the steering wheel of a spaceship navigating through the vast galaxies of data centers, autonomous vehicles, and gaming systems. The company's grip on these markets, combined with its constant innovation and R&D, make it a force to be reckoned with, like a superhero made of marshmallows.  \n\nIn the same vein, ASML's lithography machines are "

It's like what the Pied Piper of Hamelin said, "The journey of AI is long, but it dances towards the future." And as AI continues to dance in this direction, the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, ASML's lithography machines, and TSMC's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will only escalate, like a party that never ends.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 10:44:13'] This is the peak autism I come here for
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 11:24:04'] It's amazing how these "DD" posts boosting stocks always seem to come AFTER they already made a massive run. NVDA is up 100% from it's 52 week low, and you think now is a good time to buy? How to say: "BUY MY BAGS" in the most subversive way possible? Write a DD on WSB.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 16:13:39'] NVDA: Too late.  Priced in already.  TSMC: Way too much geopolitical risk.  ASML: Too hard a limit on the quantities they can produce.  Making ultra-precise instruments with a workforce of Ph.D's and engineers is cool, but if your machines get more popular you can only sell to whomever the US gov has blessed.  Intel has been trying to stop their slipping lately, I think AMD's server strategy and ease of installation is going to keep paying off.  Rumors are Intel loses a major client if they are late in their next server launch, and guess what they usually do when it comes to time management?  If you're desperate to experiment and not willing to let the wife wear a strap on, try SIMO / MXL since that's a Taiwanese semiconductor outfit getting acquired by an American.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Motion  Tho it's a little weird to invest hard in SSDs imho.  It's a bad time to invest in semiconductors, or the best time, I can't figure out which since the macro cycles of this industry are so utterly godless.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 10:32:53'] Well my 2 cents is that it is all a hype train so it will be factored in the stock prices... we always think we found the way to get rich but this market is a pepega storm
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 19:04:35'] One thing about NVDA & TSMC though: it is based in Taiwan, there is a non-zero risk of China going to war, which will likely disrupt supply chains. It may be wise to also consider companies that start preparing for this possibility by building new or relocating factories of China / Taiwan.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 11:19:51'] Tsmc largely Reuses proprietary circuit designs, which is why right to repair will never happen, it would further expose just how bad this is. Nvidia is insane by trying to sell retail gpus at miner prices even though mining is dead. Asml is cool, but they can only produce so much machinery and there is a long wait list. I‚Äôm just waiting for this tech bubble to burst, it‚Äôs over due anyways.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 12:50:23'] How do you justify a 52PE ratio for Nvidia? You need an extreme growth to justify that valorisation in a world where you can get 4% return on your equity without risk and the inflation discounting your future cash-flow?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 18:11:38'] For anyone else like me who only understood 50% of that tweet masquerading as an article, especially this sentence: "The mixed shelf will include shares of its common stock, preferred  stock, warrants, debt securities and purchase contracts, the company  said."Basically they're offering stock stock and more stock and I honestly don't know what the effective difference is for warrant vs stock vs purchase contract or how a debt security really works but here are the definitions sourced from investopedia.Warrants: Warrants are a derivative that give the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security‚Äîmost commonly an equity‚Äîat a certain price before expiration. The price at which the underlying security can be bought or sold is referred to as the exercise price or strike price. An American warrant can be exercised at any time on or before the expiration date, while European warrants can only be exercised on the expiration date. Warrants that give the right to buy a security are known as call warrants; those that give the right to sell a security are known as put warrants.  Debt Security: A debt security is a debt instrument that can be bought or sold between two parties and has basic terms defined, such as the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and maturity and renewal date.Purchase Contract: A sales and purchase agreement (SPA) is a binding legal contract between two parties that obligates a transaction to occur between a buyer and seller. SPAs are typically used for real estate transactions, but they are found in other areas of business. The agreement finalizes the terms and conditions of the sale, and it is the culmination of negotiations between the buyer and the seller.

I expect NVDA to recover any AH losses and just trade with the market in general. I was a NVDA skeptic, but honestly people are really going to miss the boat if they don't take AI seriously. AI is the future, could be a dark future where man is enslaved by machines, but it's coming.

POST_TEXT: b"NVIDIA's recent rally has been driven by retail AI hype, but my question is how will Nvidia realize and profit off of AI? It's clearly in a mania and we're still many years off large-scale AI adoption in consumer technology, so therefore I don't think there will be enough demand for Nvidia GPU's to justify it's current valuation. The only demand that might be realized are AI companies using it to power their services but that's still not enough. People still bullish on Nvidia in the short-term will be brought down with their next earning call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do y'all feel about this?"

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 09:51:47'] >You're correct that the current demand for Nvidia GPUs is largely driven by retail AI hype. However, I believe that there will be enough demand from AI companies to justify Nvidia's current valuation. Additionally, I think that the next earnings call will not have a significant impact on the stock price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 10:25:17'] Nvidia makes generic chips, which are one of the better options for AI compute power right now. But. Other companies, like Microsoft, google, are working on asic chips, which would be geared specifically for ai applications and have better performance (at least they say so on their news release). Nvidia‚Äôs usecase in the ai space is short lived, imo.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 15:03:47'] Yea, and if I was an executive board member of a trillion dollar company whose shares have experienced a massive rally, I would cash some in a reap the benefits as well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 20:43:53'] I always hate these articles because they never specify if the shares were sold as part of a 10b5-1 plan on a recurring basis since they just want a juicy headline. However I checked the actual SEC form and neither this sale nor the $28 million sale the same guy executed were part of one. This guy is actually fairly good at calling tops and bottoms. He sold at the June 2018 top, sold again at the June 2019 bottom (must‚Äôve panic sold since it was down 50%), sold again at the December 2021 top, and now is selling here‚Ä¶Funny enough the guy had 11.7 million shares at one point but sold down to 3 million all while NVDA traded in the single digits LOL. He now ‚Äúonly‚Äù has 800k remaining. Obviously easy to laugh in hindsight and he‚Äôs still super rich so I‚Äôm sure he sleeps just fine.

PS could even take a cut of the revenue from Gamepass.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 05:49:11'] I don't know why regulators would block this. I thought they said they would make a deal with Sony to license them COD for 10 years? Give me a fucking break. If Sony can't make something to compete with COD in 10 years they deserve to be pushed out of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:01:15'] >There are a few reasons why the UK doesn't produce as many tech juggernauts as the US. Firstly, the UK has a much smaller population than the US, so there's simply less room for growth. Secondly, the UK economy is more focused on services and finance than manufacturing and technology. And finally, Silicon Valley in California has been hugely successful in attracting top talent from around the world, while London (the closest equivalent in Europe) hasn't been able to replicate that success.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 20:46:38'] The US is basically a giant positive feedback loop of an economy. We have the most wealth, which means we can invest the most, which means the best talent comes here, which means we produce the most innovation, which means we create more wealth, which means we can invest more‚Ä¶Also, as far as universities‚Ä¶ obviously Oxford and Cambridge are tier 1 world class, but the US has the entire Ivy League, plus technical schools like MIT, plus a bunch of top schools like Berkeley, Duke, Northwestern, Chicago, Georgetown, etc‚Ä¶ and then on top of that each state has its own university system, each with multiple schools, each with their own research departments. And all of those schools do joint work with with the private sector and federal government.I‚Äôd also add the US military to the discussion. We spend something like a hundred billion per year on R&D just in defense spending. Obviously aerospace and ship building industries benefit the most, but there are still billions of dollars going into things like AI, material sciences, even biotech every year through the military.And then there is the global reserve currency benefit we enjoy, which helps facilitate trade deals.So, yeah, it‚Äôs just a giant positive feedback loop.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 19:46:55'] the UK is an isolated island that experiences shithouse weather and you have little to no natural resources. i think this explains in large part why your first sailers went out to explore and then consequently colonised huge swathes of land all over the world. the grass truly was greener in other parts of the world.you got too lazy off of your imperialist activities, exploiting free labour, stealing other countries' resources, looting, taxing your subject countries, etc. etc...that you didn't have to be innovative and actually work hard yourselves.your country basically got a huge leg up and became wealthy due to your colonialism. this is what made you the financial centre of the world at that time.britain is a country that is very much stuck in its ways, is not dynamic, fast-moving, etc..the fact that you still revere the royal family and subsidise their luxurious existence and ideas of aristocracy shows that you're still too "comfortable" and set in your ways and not wanting to embrace change (for the better). there is an idealisation of the notion of wanting to be treated like a celebrity, kick your feet up and relax at other people's expense, whilst you do next to nothing. might explain the proliferation of so many reality tv shows in britain too. everyone wants to become a flipping 'celebrity' and we use that term loosely. deeply set racist attitudes don't help because if you look at who heads a lot of these top-tier US companies, they're people who are immigrants. steve jobs was half syrian, etc...the fact that you voted to exit the EU also shows that you're not willing to cooperate, collaborate, learn, exchange and want to be isolationist. might also show that you have a superiority complex and that attitude does no-one any favours. you don't evolve without any outside input and perspectives.also having tory conservative governments consecutively is not conducive to growth and evolution. they basically want to keep the power in the hands of people who already have it and keep expenditure at the lowest which means not spending money on anything.can new talents rise the ranks and stand a chance and establish companies in the UK with that type of establishment and gatekeeping?there's a lot of factors which prevent innovation and dynamism in a country and i've presented some to you regarding your own country. the whole reason why the US became independent of britain was because they fought you and won after being sick of being taxed to the teeth by you.

The "they're about to find out why we don't have free healthcare" meme.The military takes our tax money and uses it to build private sector tech and snort up any remotely useful weapon adjacent stuff starting at a fairly early stage level (Ex: Army Futures Command + Capital Factory in ATX).   This combination of right time right place plus a commitment to sacrificing almost anything and everything to keep building bigger weapons forever. We keep college and healthcare behind a paywall to ensure access to young people who may die for the military industrial complex.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:08:11'] Honestly... I think your university rankings are a bit... shall we say inflated?  Not that it isn't also the case for certain US universities (e.g. I'm not sold on Harvard being all they're talked up as either).  Juggernaut companies aren't just a matter of a strong education pipeline though... I suspect it has more to do with the regulatory environment.  The US is far more tolerant of monopolies than they really should be (compare how the US and the EU treated Microsoft's browser shenanigans, the UK was in the EU at the time).  They also let them get away with more legal damage for much longer... to the point where it runs away from them and they couldn't put the cat back in the bag even if they wanted to.  Often by exploiting seemingly grey areas like Uber does with whether someone is a contractor or an employee.  This is something that I was seeing rulings on in the UK maybe even a decade earlier and those rulings were generally coming down on the side of them being employees.  And as far as I can tell from a quick search, that was upheld when it came to Uber as well: "**Uber now treats all 70,000 of its drivers in Britain as ‚Äúworkers‚Äù**  entitled to a minimum wage, holiday pay and pension plans. It comes  weeks after the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling that its drivers  were workers, not independent contractors.Mar 18, 2021" --quoted from my Google search results, Google implies it comes from this article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html)It's probably for the best that the UK doesn't produce mega companies (at least in the interest of the average UK citizen).  In the US, people still suffer heavily even from monopolies that were supposedly broken up at the time.  Even after Bell System was smashed in 1984, the separated companies operated regionally, effectively leaving local monopolies.  And to this day the US appears to be fairly unique in the cooperation between device manufacturers and retailers with phone companies to lock customers into long term phone contracts at purchase with strange financing options.  E.g. you cannot buy an iPhone at Best Buy without signing a cell phone contract.  You have to go direct to the Apple store to get one without contract in the US (or slightly shady methods, unlocked imports on Amazon, eBay phones that who knows..., etc.).  This level of anti-competitive operation is mostly not legal in the UK and EU.    Likewise, when these companies go overseas, they often have US government support even when they operate in ways that aren't normally locally legal.  Less egregiously (maybe?) these days, but the term Banana Republic refers to governments beholden to US firms operating in South America (Honduras, Costa Rica,...).  Of course British companies were able to operate that way back in the days of the British Empire, but these days the UK has less political and economic weight to throw around in that respect.  The British and Dutch East India companies started as local monopolies and again, benefited from the projection of power globally.  Mega companies require political buy in to have favorable policies and procedures through regulatory capture.  More robust political involvement and stronger regulatory authority and independence would be expected to put a damper on such massive enterprises.

Our retirement accounts are linked to the stock market. Side gigs make us feel proud of ourselves and not drained. You talk about work-life balance but work is our life. The American Dream is gathering more and more assets through capitalism. We are not afraid of being overly leveraged( that has screwed us sometimes but has largely helped us grow exponentially)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:13:25'] Economy is kinda our thing
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:29:27'] Bro the UK is so shitty at business. Y‚Äôall take months of vacation and believe people have a right to privacy online. No shit you have no tech companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:37:25'] I second this post and want to also say the ASX (Australia) is similarly dogshit for a sharemarket. Only banks and mining - fuck all innovation
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:41:19'] Honestly I think it‚Äôs our diversity as a nation.  Immigration is often shit on but I think it‚Äôs a huge engine for innovation. People come here for a better life and work their ass off to achieve that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 05:49:52'] >I agree that NVIDIA is a strong company with good prospects for growth. However, I would caution investors to be mindful of the stock's high valuation. It is currently trading at around 60 times earnings, which means that it could come under pressure if earnings fail to meet expectations in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 06:07:06'] Cash flow got fucked this thing has Cramer germs
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 07:13:42'] I like their cards, but the stock price is dumb and wrong and embarassingly overpriced and completely ridiculous like it's 1929. Crypto crash is probably hitting them like a pile of bricks to the face, I wouldn't touch Nvidia with a 10ft pole even across a 20 year timeframe, shit is stupidly overpriced and techfreak culttards are wrong about it. Once it crashes maybe I'll consider because I like the company, but only stupid people think this market cap makes sense.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 08:19:47'] Bought puts on open.&#x200B;1. The market tends to give back this sort of outsized moves2. Move itself was caused by low liquidity after hours, non representative of real sentiment, ie the MM needed some shares and just bought whatever was available3. Market as a whole is flirting with a level where it might flush down soon4. Macro environment - Interest rates might have to go up more than anticipated&#x200B;That said I am a believer in NVDA just not at current price levels. Lost my position in January expiration due to writing covered calls, am planning to buy them back at some point but at a more normalized level.

Then everyone and their grandma were like nooo bc inflation will make them raise rates which is bad for shares. so fine, I get it. Now that raising rates is done we still need to price in 30% inflation so ATH it is. You will not convince me otherwise.

I would never want to ride in a Cessna, private helicopter, or even a private 747 (or whatever Boeing/Airbus is popular in the private jet world these days). The only reason why planes don't crash regularly anymore is because they have ultra-high maintenance and safety standards. A ton of people regularly check the planes over and over again. I'd trust a mainstream commercial airliner or a military jet, but I'm keeping my distance from private stuff. https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/04/us/southwest-virginia-aircraft-crash/index.htmlThe same goes for medical care. I don't want a distinguished private practice surgeon. I want a team of attendings, fellows, residents, and medical students at an academic medical center where they ask me the same annoying questions over and over again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:25:41'] Found the top, thanks OP
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 20:34:15'] The problem is not that NVDA doesn't have a viable product, or that NVDA doesn't have one of the biggest moats in the history of technomoats. The issue is that their valuation leaves them precariously overexposed to a market drop.Look at Intel in the years 1999 - 2000. We would need a big market catalyst to drop the price quite a bit, but in such a case, they would slough like crazy.Intel actually had a significantly (and relatively over time) lower PE ratio is 1999, https://www.fool.com/archive/dripport/1999/06/04/intel-ligent-valuation-drip-port-june-4-1999.aspx, but doubled in 2000 on the bubble, and then popped back down to 20 after the crash.All the while, they had a solid tech moat. Making CPU chips that others couldn't make, and while all the other companies that were buying Intel chips either went bankrupt, or otherwise decreased demand, Intel survived due to incredible footwork in fast shifting winds. Well, and again, because they had the same moat that NVDA has now.This isn't a call to stock up on NVDA puts. No clue how this market will go. Anyways, NVDA is a mature growth company. For all intents and purposes, NVDA is a company with its feet firmly planted, yet they have a barely realized market and 20 years of a head start. Nobody (in the business world at least) thought that graphics cards would ever be used by anyone besides glorified dungeons and dragons fans.I'm not sure Nvidia even knew about the potential. You could say they were quite lucky, because they've developed these cards with one competitor who targeted cheap cards, while they targeted advancement while nobody was watching, which put them in the perfect position to dominate AI (again, who knew a GPU would be used for AI in 2000?). Spurred by crypto miners, they fleshed out the number systems they could use for computations. It's almost this perfect storm, and an insatiable desire to be the very best that has put them in the position they are in. I'm not talking about the market. I'm talking about them as a company which makes a product. They just keep coming up with the best solutions, that put them into positions to capitalize on unforeseen opportunity. Somebody must've had a good fortune cookie.It's not necessarily the same thing as Intel.But nonetheless, if the market turns, you better believe NVDA puts will print and somebody out there will probably gobble up a literal fortune.Because anyways, Intel's AI processing is not that terrible compared to Nvidia. In fact, it's marginally cheaper to run a full AI training set as far as energy goes, just so... unbelievably slooooow compared.But do we genuinely see a big drop happening? Do we actually have an incorrectly leveraged market right now? Or maybe, could investor choices change rapidly? For example, if war broke out and America was directly involved, would big time investors still want to keep as much money in this stock?Honestly, what I see happening is a huge surprise on the earnings to come from here, so that the price to earnings ratio will be quickly justifi- well... less unjustifiable - back in the orbit of our solar system at least.I don't care if I'm wrong either way prediction wise, other than to say, I like the tech, bro.Will the price go down in the meantime? I wouldn't be surprised, but remember, the market can remain irrational far longer than you can remain solvent. Maybe some of that extrinsic rationale will become a bit more of a rational valuation. Or at least, AI AI AI AI AI AI AI

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 18:45:57'] NVDA will likely fall, not the company but the stock price  (I don't think anyone is believing that the company will have any issue to lead the market with quite an advance), because shit happens independently of companies. (reference: literally just 3 years ago and without such a dramatic example, a bunch of other times).The \`when\` and \`how much\` and \`for how long\` is up in the airs.It is fair to consider that NVDA is overbought, it's fair to be grinning side to side because you entered early, as it is fair to not get depressed for selling too early and not rushing back to enter.And for those that have enough confidence and resources to play with options and bank big, my hat down to them.AI not being a bubble does not prevent the current AI "trend" and how it is marketed to be a bubble.  I don't think it will grow as exponatially fast than it is presented or seem to be believed and I believe that there will be further opportunities later to join the ride.Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm recovering from FOMO and ain't gonna be dragged into a relapse.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 22:42:58'] Except they aren't the only company that can make a spinning Jenny.Intel and AMD both have top quality in every characteristic that defines a GPU.In fact amd and Intel have a major advantage in that they not only have thr GPU they have a Cpu and programmable logic.NVDA is a great company, and I'm 100% long on them.  But they aren't unique in any shape or form

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 21:13:30'] NVDA is definitely not the only company that can make the spinning jenny. So can AMD, TSMC, and Intel. And NVDA technology is behind academia, it is just stabilized, scaled up, and commercialized. Combine this with superpower companies and giant governments pouring their cash reserves into chip manufacturing, and I can‚Äôt imagine they keep their competitive advantage for long. NVDA won‚Äôt crash but it is not the Dutch East Indies Company or something.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 21:10:57'] As someone who works for a company that works with nvidia, AI will catapult nvidia even further. AI using gpu compute and what nvidia is doing is revolutionary. Look at their A100 and H100 platforms. MSFT is huge and stayed huge not because of retail, but because of enterprise. Nvidia is is set to do the same thing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 22:03:31'] People who compare now to the first industrial revolution are almost as bad as the people who compare everything to the great depression.There is no technology right now that comparable to going from the horse to the steam engine. From daylight labor to 24 hour factories. From individual construction to mass production.AI just isn't even close. Yes it will probably do some human jobs sooner than expected, but people are out of there minds if they think our social structure is remotely ready to accept fully autonomous drivers, doctors, engineers etc let alone the technology can actually do everything its advertised to do. And it's gonna be a looong time before a robot is building houses or repairing your car.Industrial revolutions are about new forms of *energy*..Horse to coal to oil to fission. Where we are now is an economy with 21st century tech, built on 19 and 20th century energy. I don't have a crystal ball to say NVDA might not go up from here, but I can confidently say this is NOT an industrial revolution and stop drinking from Cathy Woods fruit punch bowl.

There are many potential dangers associated with artificial intelligence, such as machines becoming self-aware and deciding to wipe out humanity (as depicted in popular films like The Terminator). While it is true that AI can be used for beneficial purposes such as improving efficiency in factories or providing better healthcare, there is also the potential for misuse by corrupt governments or individuals.

It would be safe to assume somewhere in the 20 to 30% range, but it could be more. It could also be less. The important thing to realize is this cycle for Nvidia was based mostly on retail. This means the enterprise cycle hasn‚Äôt started. It is definitely going to be huge, but nothing says, and nobody knows if the stock is going to continue going up immediately, or go down before it goes back up. Statistically based on historical data, it is most likely to experience a slight correction.

Mi300 is just about ready, and it's a huge leap forward (eclipses H100) . AMD has a huge portfolio now all the way up and down the datacenter stack. They are going to eat into Nvidias AI lunch, the same way they did Intel's. AMD has more room to grow here and it's Nvidia's game to lose. I know where I'm putting my money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 04:01:51'] a GPU is not the only thing you can use to do massive multithreaded computing. Ever heard of RISC, FPGAs and ASICs?Its rather expensive to develop essentially custom hardware to solve a computing problem, however, if you run at scale, it is worth it. Nvidia does not own the market for those, and there will be specialized hardware for AI training, if your theory holds up of it being the end all future of it all.TLDR: Your theory is that Nvidia is the main manufacturer of hammers, and since every handyman needs a hammer, Nvidia will be forever without competition. Thing is thou, there are powertools out there as well that a handyman can use, and Nvidia does not own that market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:03:47'] This is a dumb stance.Microsoft had a borderline monopoly on PCs when PCs were king. They were genuinely as important to society as people believed - they still ate shit during the dot com bubble.Important product/company does not equate to being properly valued. There's a reason a company like Nvidia is riding this hype train, and the hype being there in the first place is deserving in some capacity, but that does not mean it should be worth over a trillion dollars. Such an obscene amount of money! Arguably no company should, but if you look at the other companies in the club, at least they make sense.Even if you would counter with the fact that our ideas of what proper valuations are may be outdated (a P/E > 25 being the benchmark is extremely outdated and myopic) this is obviously a hype train. If you invested right now, you're probably betting more so on the idea that more people will keep buying than you are that it will continue to accumulate value, even if those are "technically" the same idea.The only rebuttal I would accept is a comparison to Tesla, in the sense that people will be so bought into the idea of Nvidia being valuable that the actual valuation won't matter, even though it's absurd by every metric out there, and that people will just keep buying regardless of the valuations. It feels like bad odds to bet that the company will remain detached from the actual finances though.

Just look at the dot com bubble, even after it popped and bottomed they were still above where the bubble began. A lot of money can be made from riding a bubble, especially if it's only just beginning

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 23:38:01'] > Nvidia is the only company that can make the spinning jenny for now.They don't even own the factories - they rely on TSMC like everyone else, so they're bidding with Cloud Providers and that will eat their margins.This stuff is so easy to make and software is portable, so everyone has it. Just look at AMD, Cloud TPUs (Google, AWS, Azure), Tesla FSD and D1, Apple "bionic" M1/M2 chips. [They're highly competitive](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-v4-mlperf-2-0-results).No moat, no consumer products except niche PC gaming, no Cloud Services, no A.I. services (Chat GPT runs on MS Azure, [PALM on GCP](https://developers.generativeai.google/products/makersuite). MS is still running Nvidia, but [they've been working on their own chip since 2019](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-athena-ai-chip-tsmc).Just another boring and easily replaceable hardware vendor. Even if A.I. is as promising as market believes it is, demand for Nvidia's equipment will soon drop like it did for Cisco in 2000. How does that look for your Projected Earnings?

POST_TEXT: b"With the rise of OpenAI's language tool, ChatGPT, Wall Street traders are increasingly betting on chip-makers like Nvidia, which has climbed more than 34% this month.\n\nAs a result, CEO Jensen Huang, who cofounded the company in 1993, has seen his wealth balloon by more than a third to $18.9 billion.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, the $5.1 billion gain gives Huang the largest percentage gain to his net-worth among US billionaires so far this year.\n\nThe 59-year-old Taiwanese immigrant is coming off a less memorable year, as he was among other tech moguls who lost big money, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla's Elon Musk.\n\nMicrosoft this month reportedly invested $10 billion into ChatGPT's parent company, OpenAI, which has fueled interest in the artificial intelligence space overall. The bot has shown a capacity for a range of tasks such as writing stock stories, layoff emails, and even dating-app messages.\n\nNvidia's role as a dominant player in the chip-making spa"

I know AI AI AI AI.... but be specific? Who is footing a data center expansion this large... or is this direct to consumer sales and there is a return to the local systems for AI?- These are on existing products / chip sets and no RD costs or moves/cost in production shift to move to AI or its specialty chip-sets?I find the turnaround interesting to say the least.

But that's it. You still have income from a job, you still have whatever money in your checking account, but now you can't borrow anymore.So the government would have to instantly stop spending above revenue until the limit in the credit card gets raised. That's it.Currently, the government spends a bit over $17 billion and makes a bit over $13 billion a day; thus borrowing about $4 billion a day. So when they hit the debt ceiling, they have to spend less for a while.

Some years the congressional idiots take it further so there is more panic.  At points it would seem Congress needs to have this panic so that their constituents think something is being done.   But honestly it is all grandstanding which is soon forgotten until the next year.  Never could understand how this winds up people to a panic when this is a yearly rite of passage for Congress.  People never read or learn history.  Tempest in a teapot time.

They know if they actually let the US default, they'd lose all their leverage and destroy the economy. So they will keep kicking the can down the road, keeping us on the brink but never letting it actually go off the cliff.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:28:38'] I'm not sure of anything. I just don't think it matters if it does or doesn't. I learned years ago I cannot time the market. So now I don't try.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:29:48'] Nobody is sure. It's just very unlikely. Our fearless leaders in DC don't want a collapse under their watch as they'd all lose their jobs and their ability to continue to enrich themselves from those positions. Also, their stock portfolios would tank as well in spite all of the calculated insider trading. So, purely selfish reasons.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:23:55'] Where is all the money going to go? Its not going to go to the chinese yuan. Swiss Francs? Euros? The US dollar is the fiat currency of the world and there is no where else to go. What it may do is raise interest rates on US debt. Mississippi defaulted on its debt over 100 years ago and they still pay more in interest rates to borrow money because of it.  What I do know is that all the members of congress should lose their next election. If they cant agree on funding the budget they cant do anything else. Democracy means you dont always get everything you want.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:24:19'] Biden needs a distraction from possible legal problems.  Republicans may view a default as a good thing.  And may play to a faction within the party.    Not a good combination. Politically,  I don't think either side sees it as catristrophic.   Some may see it as a plus.  Both think they can blame the other.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:25:58'] If they had a deal without enough time to get the whole thing through they could simply pass a resolution to fund the debt for the next couple weeks while they formalized the actual bill.  The thing passed would be tiny enough to actual have been read and preserve the spirit of the requirement on the speaker which would probably save him from a revolt.  This is assuming the proposed deal was palatable to the large majority of the Republican side of the house.  If they were only trying to sneak something through with all the Democrats and a handful of Republican defectors, then yea they would totally blow that shit up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 06:53:17'] When a stock like NVDA is valued at $1T and has a PE of 250, that implies that it could eventually have a market cap of $10T since the very high PE suggests very high revenue and earnings growth on revenues of $3T or 4T.  Why would any company ever be worth half the national GDP?  These valuations are absurd.  AAPL at $2.8T with a 30PE is absurd (suggests at least 3X growth in the next 5 years).  This is the blowoff speculation before a very big fall

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 19:03:13'] Yeah we haven't actually seen the correction yet. At some point in this process, a crisis will happen. This almost did already with the bank failures, but the government bailed it out fast. However there's a huge corporate debt bubble that is quickly adjusting rates. When the credit markets fall like dominos, what happens next?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:30:33'] The top 20 stocks in the S&P 500 make up a significant portion of the index's weight and contribute to most of its return. However, they only make up 7.08% of the total return so far this year. The rest of the stocks in the index have contributed very little to its overall performance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 22:51:51'] Stop trying to win, focus on cutting losers instead. When you "try to win" you hang on to losing positions far too long and long after the market has proven your thesis wrong.For example: You hold shares in a struggling company but then they announce a bankruptcy and liquidation of their assets. At this point you should move on and find a new trade. (This example is fiction and any resemblance to real events is purely coincidence.)

You‚Äôre 100% extrinsic value and theta is eating you alive. So, rather than pout on WSB, go learn from your mistakes. What would your P/L look like if you had bought ATM or ITM? Did you buy in the last few days when the stocks were already severely overbought, and if so, what would P/L look like if you had bought ATM/ITM when the stocks were oversold and just starting to rally?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 11:03:10'] This is what I wonder when my trades stop moving. It‚Äôs not me. Eh NO. I is too smart. It is one of you who entered the trade and fucked it all up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 11:23:29'] I just bought a lot of stocks today, knowing my luck the market is going to absolutely tank these next few weeks üòÇ
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 10:39:15'] Can you please sell, so the price can go up again?You are bringing the whole market down with your behavior.Better yet, buy some puts. I can go get a list of stocks for you to buy puts so my portfolio increases in value.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 10:42:49'] Because of this I always average down gradually into a position. I don't just slap 10k down in a single transaction.I'll buy 1k, and of course it'll go down right after that, then I buy another 1k, and down again it'll go. So on and so forth until I've dropped the whole 10k.Or, I buy all at once then immediately sell at-the-money covered calls.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:56:53'] It's not a bubble. It's just overvalued and will drop and then go up. Just like every "bubble" regarding tech in the last 30 years. A single company also can't be a bubble. The real bubble is the gazillion AI startups that don't actually do anything different than each other but just repackage APIs. That's the real bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 04:07:11'] I don't trust it until cramer says it isn't a bubble
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 08:57:12'] This is a massive price increase, definitely overvalued, but the potential is huge. If you listen to the Q1 2023 earning calls of Invidia, Palantir, C3 AI, Soundhound and so on you start realising how this industry has the potential of starting a new era. Definitely overvalued, but that‚Äôs the price you have to pay for getting a piece of this unique pie. Amazon, Apple, Google and the like have all had this phase, where it‚Äôs difficult to distinguish between bubble and beginning of a huge growth industry. There have been also plenty of flops, pure bubbles that have at some point burst, where the promises have not held up. So definitely overvalued, but I wouldn‚Äôt be that sure it‚Äôs a bubble. I tend rather to think this is the beginning of something big, and the markets have realised early on, so are pushing up the prices to crazy levels, but I doubt it‚Äôs going much down anytime soon. Give it a try and listen to a couple of relevant earning calls, you‚Äôll get a better sense of what‚Äôs happening.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:42:52'] People don‚Äôt understand how incredibly expensive 30x sales is. If the company had no costs, paid no salaries, issued no stock comp, and returned all of its revenues to shareholders, it would take 30 years to pay you back‚Ä¶ you can assume growth of course but that‚Äôs A LOT of ground to make up.In comparison, the 30 year is paying you 4% per year.Take a look at the long time chart of CSCO.Cisco has a negative annualized return going back to April of 2000. 23 years and the return is still NEGATIVE. This is with dividends reinvested.It‚Äôs far more common for stocks to simply languish than to go bankrupt. NVDA could be around 20 years from now, still in business, making a great product and have 0 stock return over the entire period.https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2000&firstMonth=4&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=CSCO&allocation1_1=100
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 00:45:30'] Yes. I work in AI, I use cuda, I've bought Nvidia cards for 20 years.But I sold all my stock a month ago. When things come crashing down because LLMs don't replace everyone's job, then maybe I'll buy in again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 20:26:27'] The stock went up 27% after hours during the earnings call. That‚Äôs like taking 3-5 years worth of accelerated profits into account. I sold at 385. This is a general public stock now, it‚Äôs current upside is limited. Especially when you consider the market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 00:07:02'] investors dont give a shit about sales today, they look to the future, when AI becomes more prevalent there will be an even greater increase in demand for their data centers/products, they are already seeing a surge in demand for them especially from huge companies, their revenue for that alone is over 4 billion and was the reason why their quarterly revenue was higher, future looks promising nvidia
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:58:12'] It is but predicting when it will come down is basically impossible
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:34:56'] 37.8x current sales.  CURRENT.  They are the picks and shovels driving the AI revolution that hasn‚Äôt even begun.  Let me know when it hits $1,000

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:54:20'] Yet analyst have 12 month targets for 450-500. Lmao.AI is real but unfortunately there is way too much hype. It's trading at 2027 prices if it can grow revenue 30-40% yearly. I highly doubt it will be able to continue to do that. Maybe one or two years max
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:53:12'] I believe it's very overpriced. But if people keep buying millions of $ in OTM puts, it will surely keep going up
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 22:29:52'] The key difference is Grace Hopper.No, not the computer scientist, the platform named after her.I was just reading up on the architecture the other weekend and the tech here is pretty profound, especially when you consider the power of the ARM chip in the combo platform. The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.And the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.I take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. Should it be this way? No.Does it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely. It's an apples and oranges comparison.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:11:20'] The problem is that companies just came out saying they need more time to develop ai. Ai is smoke and mirrors right now. The application is tough because it‚Äôs a language model. Spent a lot of time on mushrooms discussing this with some other that are near the industry. Language was on topic that kept coming up along with the fact we have no idea how much computing power ai could take. Everyone thought bitcoin mining took a lot of work, now considered ai that is running thousands of computations to come up with the ‚Äúright‚Äù answer. It‚Äôs gonna be a mess for a while and may never reach its full potential cause it‚Äôs based on humans and our language

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:26:52'] Well using a perpetual dividend model to make an equivalent company: Nvidia has a cost of equity about 9.55%. I am going to say this theoretical company is going to have a dividend growth of 8% per year for perpetuity, then NVDA is currently priced equivalent to a company that returns a $6.5 annual dividend that grows 8% FOREVER. This is absurd, the price will definitely come down or their cost of equity will skyrocket.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:43:02'] Nvidia has been riding on the crypto boom since 2016.  The market did crash in 2017 and Nvidia coasted on their RTX 20 series which weren't well received.  Then COVID19 happened and everyone got government checks and stayed home to play games, but more importantly another crypto boom happened.  The crypto market went proof of stake, which means you won't be using Nvidia GPU's to mine crypto.  To the day the #2 GPU used on Steam is the GTX 1060, a 2016 graphics card.  The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.  Also these bulls are looking for anything that goes up and their collective mind has settled on Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:13:42'] It‚Äôs not over, priced only because demand forward growth potential, long-term growth, supply and demand order contracts‚Ä¶ Dot anywhere purchase between 317 and 417 is a great purchase for the next 3 to 8 years
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:51:55'] Let me put some perspective. If Nvidia has revenue of 100bn (will have to more than double) with a profit margin of 40% (will have to increase from 30%) they will generate 40 bn in profit and multiply that by 25 will give you 1 trillion marketcap. So basically its overvalued. A lot of future is priced in for perfection. I would suggest short it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:27:57'] It wasn‚Äôt too long ago that Tesla was trading @ $1200 + a share how would it be crazy to think a company based on technology that could replace millions of jobs be in the same ballpark. The main question is your cost average at an overbought level to maximize ROI
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:29:09'] Its less expensive now than it was before they announced earnings. Going from 7 billion to 11 billion is pretty amazing
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:43:10'] It's incredibly overvalued but it'll keep riding cause you know, fuck you

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 03:59:17'] 50x forward P/E for a company that‚Äôs expecting massive sales and earnings growth isn‚Äôt that overpriced to me personally.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:32:07'] Let‚Äôs put it this way, what company is worth more: the manufacturer that makes brake pads, or Ford? There is your answer. GPU‚Äôs are important for AI but they aren‚Äôt going to be the money driver it will be the products other companies develop. Also most likely the big AI company hasn‚Äôt been started yet, but the future owner probably just got fired from his tech job.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:50:08'] It's overvalued but not grossly. Look at its forward data. Forward PE 40. Could definitely do with say a 20% correction but they could just as easily grow another 10% together with a 10% correction instead. Plus it has hype status.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 21:32:30'] Go watch this video - It's 2 hours - it's a seriousness test? When you are done, if you are still down on Nvidia, best of luck. The new NVIDIA DGX GH200 is a super-computer you can stuff in an oversized closet, which performs at 1 exaflop.What is an exaflop? A billion, billions.Or in simpler terms, every time you say "One-One Thousand" the GH200 can perform 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 mathematical computations. Do you think businesses will want this kind of energy and space savings?[NVIDIA Keynote at COMPUTEX 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-wpzS9ZsCs)

At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via¬†Bloomberg):At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

So yup, expect a class action or at the very least expect quality perception problems when it comes to nVidia. I‚Äôd expect loss in sales and share. My guess is that someone made a mistake on required gauge and cut it to close, or the wire acquired are not up to the quality with respect to the conductivity, that they replaced a copper wire with a copper composite and it heats up more.This is a COMMON problem with Chinese wires. they‚Äôre either too thin, or the metal is shit quality.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 07:28:07'] Most likely will be green just because we are in the midst of a bull run, but this has little impact. This has already been priced into the market, hence the rally the past few weeks while media tries to sell you this story of US defaulting. As a trader of over 10yrs, I have seen this hysteria with  the debt ceiling multiple times and we always come to a resolution and avoid default. The real money knows that as well and never doubted it, unlike the media would lead you to believe.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 08:22:18'] It has not been reached, it‚Äôs a tentative agreement, you brainless regard. They still have to vote on it ü•¥

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:28:27'] This is when the bloody show truly begins. This is the biggest bull trap in history. Everyone going to pile in only to get rugged so hard as the bond yields spike and treasuries get dumped. Maybe not on Tuesday but soon. Maybe it‚Äôll take papa powell coming out as a hawk but it‚Äôs going to happen in the near future

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 15:02:54'] I see a lot of stupid. Puts for sure
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 15:07:13'] Remember, CPI inflation is a year-over-year number. We've been comparing inflation improvements over last year's numbers when inflation was climbing each month, making it easier to beat. It peaked in June '22. After June this year we'll begin comparing inflation to a number that started dropping a year ago meaning it will be a harder comparison. I think CPI will become harder to beat after June numbers and will start going up again. The easy inflation has been tackled. The hard sticky inflation of wages and employment will be harder to improve upon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 17:53:19'] Still has to be passed by both the House and Senate, regard. And there's a lot of pissed off Repubs and Dems about this "deal" that essentially accomplishes nothing for anyone.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 05:39:39'] I am from the future here to tell you the results of the FOMC meeting today.Jerome Powell walks out on stage, says inflation is no more as he has hiked rates 5.5bps. Everyone begins freaking out at the economic turmoil that is sure to follow, markets begin tanking immediately. JPow quiets the room, he announces a joint plan with Janet Yellen and Biden to print 100 Trillion USD for stimulus checks to every US citizen ($100/person) the rest will go to banks. "This should prevent a recession", he says. As the crowd cheers Powell whispers into the mic, "fuck your puts, fuck your calls" before leaving.The economy never recovers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:22:16'] In my personal opinion and chart analysis we need considerable buying pressure to break above 4200 and actually make a move to 4300. Buying pressure that I don‚Äôt think we have. I‚Äôm personally going to be buying puts because I believe we sell the news. Debt ceiling was already baked in. Should be some controlled selling back to 4100 as I see it. I‚Äôll be planning my next moves there
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 19:33:53'] The daily marked to market maintenance requirement for this position is only $224,000. This is not a $4.2mm position, and it only moves $1,000 per 1 ES point.With your position being down over 100 ES points, you either have a regulation T call on your account that will auto close your position tonight at 1am during mark to market, or you have to deposit cash into the account to top up to $224,000 to maintain the position. Do you enjoy lying on the internet?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 14:33:14'] Posts like this are like a good cup of soup with a hearty broth on a cold day. I don‚Äôt ever wish anyone harm, but every failure she or anyone has is a chance for a wake up call, so have no problems in enjoying this catastrophe. Very pleasant and soothing indeed. The consistency and magnitude of these L‚Äôs are almost meditative.The days come and go. My life is happening, things are always changing. Yet with all this constant motion, Cathie Woods consistently drops the worst trades like clockwork. A steady, colossal, drip of Ls. Every loss she takes is so big it‚Äôs scale is lost on my simple mind. Yet there they go. One by one. Each loss and failure measured on a celestial scale that is beyond my grasp. Bigger Ls than I can understand with dollar amounts bigger than what I‚Äôve ever seen or may ever see. I know that no matter what happens in my small little life, Cathie is out there, in the ether, losing more money than I could ever even know.Cathie‚Äôs Ls loom over us all in the aether, dripping so mightily. How could us, such small beings, be bound by the same force of time as such colossal and awe inspiring losses? Yet here we are. If time is a big enough place for Cathie‚Äôs losses to exist, then how small must we be‚Ä¶ in the grand scheme of time.These posts bring me true bliss and contentment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-16 15:22:07'] Nvidia was always going to struggle when energy went up and bit coin went down. Then miners flooded the market with ‚Äúcheap‚Äù cards‚Ä¶This has nothing to do with AI or Data centres. This was large scale miners which returns dwindled once energy costs went up and bitcoins price went down.Nvidia is massively inflated for me. Sure we all buy a gaming card from them every few years‚Ä¶ is that really enough to justify the valuation?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 06:45:57'] Now? Look at your chart you missed 2 good entry points. Wait for a random relief rally if you‚Äôre going to short. Could it keep going without a relief rally? Sure, but right now you‚Äôre more likely to be shorting the bottom right before a random rally, and close for a loss. You are right at support line‚Ä¶ that you drew. Why would you short there?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 19:01:53'] I don't like this play much and just wanted to register my sentiment.  You may be right but I don't see it as a slam dunk.  It has sold down a lot and had a hard bounce up earlier in the year.  It has sold into an area of liquidity so I don't see a free fall happening quick.  I know a lot of people don't like the bald man but an emotional trade isn't a smart one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 02:51:55'] The problem technically seems to be around the "bending of cable connections and thereby breaking the thick outer cables left/right". Due bending the connection to the big cables gets disconnected and the rest of thin cables have to handle the too much high watt demand ...So the "graphics card" itself doesn't need to be recalled ... they would only require a much better stable connecting gable (maybe with a plastic fixed molding around connector pins.The card itself is already so monstrous huge ... maybe it doesn't matter anymore in case the connection cable also becomes huge ;).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 10:22:18'] 1. Nvidia is stupidly overpriced, no argument there, but they have a monopoly on software libraries and make the best gpus in the world by a huge margin. As far as cpus go, Intel has everything to lose while AMD has everything to gain. Case in point, datacenter. EPYC is uncontested and AMD is taking huge chunks of Intel's datacenter marketshare at will every quarter. 2. Intel is only competitive because their chips use an insane amount more power than AMD. 13900K @ 253w = 7950X @ 142w. Thats far more than just a node advantage and not remotely close. AMD has the superior architecture, not Intel.3. ARC is NOT competitive with AMD and Nvidia. You can't compare Intel's flagship to 3 year old AMD and Nvidia entry level gpus and claim that. The 770 is roughly on par with competition flagships from 8-9 years ago. So complete and utter dogshit compared to the 4090 or 7900XTX.4. Pat may be able to turn things around, but that will take years, and  it's no secret that beaurocracy runs rampant at Intel HQ.5. Incorrect. Jensen said they were good but never said they were going to use them. People misinterpreted it as being about Intel since Jensen mentioned Arizona, suprise! TSMC has a new fab in Arizona too.6. Same goes for TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries.7. TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries are building fabs stateside, or already have fabs set up and are funded by the CHIPS Act. Intel isn't going to be the only option if Tawain gets invaded. 8. Most software libraries are written for Cuda. Nvidia essentially has a monopoly on AI due to that alone. AMD has long made competitive work station gpus, but the fact that most software libraries are in Cuda has made them sell poorly by comparison. Intel is in the same predicament.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 04:19:09'] Lol, market always thinks about future. Why Intel price to sales is 2 because it is going to loose price war further into the future and AMD is going to gain huge market share that is why price to sales market is thinking even 8 is cheap. By this logic market thinks Intel is overvalued even now and market is beating it down while AMD will have huge sales in future and market thinks it is undervalued. Wait for Dow index to throw out Intel and add Nvidia or AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 22:50:09'] Why is ASML no factor in your consideration?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 09:54:26'] Don't agree with all the bullet points but yes Intel is undervalued. Gelsinger is actually one of its problems IMHO.  Their Tower Semi, Altera and foundry plays are going to do well. Note MOST semiconductors are not leading edge and driven by Moore's Law reductions. Older fabs print money.   Their ARC GPU's are a decent first effort but in Intel fashion - late to the party. Their drivers are a hot mess and it will be 3 years before they are on par with NVIDIA or AMD.  Note ARC has no AI/Tensorcores which is what is making NVIDIA the winner.   Intels AI is damn good but is not showing the commitment needed.  With regard to datacenter, Intel is a chip player. Nvidia is a chip player and box and network builder.  Intel has all the pieces but fails to execute. I have to wonder if they are handicapped by NOT competing against their customers. As for their customers - ARM (which Intel had and dumped on Marvell) is King of the Core. Most server farm (especially virtualization) is ARM based.  Alibaba made their own server chip (128 cores/ 128 PCI lanes supporting 16 GPUS) which leaves Intel in the dust.IMHO Intel has indecisive, risk averse leadership and really poor marketing vision right now. Note it has NEVER had the latter and lived off the PC cash cow business but that is faltering as people are using their PC's much longer and do more and more on tablets and smartphone apps.

They have a huge disadvantage in battery life and efficiency.  The only reason they hold on to market share is they spend a lot to build there moat.2- Intels stock price is like where it was 20 years ago‚Ä¶.. when they had a technology lead!!  Now they are 2-3 years behind.3- they are uncompetitive on their most profitable segment‚Ä¶. Where AMD is expected to continue to take market share close to 40% as Intel has no competitive servers on their roadmap until 2025.4- profits are going to decrease tremendously‚Ä¶. They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry‚Ä¶.how will they compete but on cost?5-  Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI?  The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space‚Ä¶. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?6- This post makes me want to ü§¢ ü§Æ.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 14:30:38'] INTC has been run like üí© for at least 20 years (probably closer to 25). They have messed up most of their big projects for a quarter of a century. Remember Itanium (aka Merced) ? Meanwhile AMD leapfrogged them in the 64 bit space.What was that division they started to make chips for digital televisions and ended up folding after less than a year ? At the time, the NYT ran a story about the prototypes being turned into a very expensive disco ball.What about mobile ? There was an effort at Intel to get x86 chips into Android devices. I am vaguely familiar with it because the company I worked for at the time in the mobile space, was solicited to test one of their chips . Nothing came of it. I think some Samsung 10 inch tablet did use an x86 Intel processor but it also contained some hardware so it could run ARM code.Speaking of ARM, they've lost the Apple market. And it wouldn't surprise me if, over the next couple of years, Microsoft also ramped up their support for ARM.Even in the data center, there are companies playing with non x86 architectures. And Moore's Law having slowed down significantly since the early 2000's, for some players, general purpose processors aren't cutting it anymore.Intel's last quarter of a century has been an unmitigated disaster. They survive thanks to their legacy businesses, none of which are safe. Management has been uniformly incompetent. Thankfully they didn't spin off their manufacturing or they'd.already be dead.So given all this, what's different now to make you think Intel's future is brighter than its past ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 02:50:39'] Intel can compete with AMD by drawing double the power in dumb fuck's desktops and laptops and is coasting on the fact that most consumers are too ignorant about computer hardware to realise they are getting shafted choosing Intel hardware.Not everyone is as keen to blindly believe a company with a 5 year record of fumbling an absolutely enormous moat is suddenly going to flip to dominance because it had a one off hot run on the back of core2duo...Lisa Su shits all over Gelsinger

One such example would be the company's efforts to design and manufacture its own mobile chips.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 20:32:45'] Imagine being the leader in computer chips by a giant margin. So much that people advertised the intel in side adds. Making huge profits and reinvesting a small amount into microchips for cell phones. Then the brain trust thinks they are spending too much money in r&d and the investors aren‚Äôt happy. So they cut the rd for cell phones. Who wants a tiny computer in their hand?A couple years later Apple releases the iPhone. This was the most profitable company in tech and they missed cell phones and graphic cards. They let Nvidia run with GPU and let Arm and Qualcomm dominate mobile. Now AMD is eating their lunch.You could not try to be that bad at running a business!Intel will be terrible until they are obsolete.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 00:52:34'] Your DD is that if China invades Taiwan, and we somehow don‚Äôt enter world war 3 over that, intel will moon? The next platform/generation of chips are on a completely different playing field. Intel can‚Äôt compete with Nvidia‚Äôs decades of investments into accelerated graphics.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 22:25:53'] >1. I agree that Nvidia's current pricing is unsustainable, but their products are still superior to AMD's in many ways.2. Current generation Intel CPUs are indeed competitive with AMD's offerings, despite the fact that AMD has an advantage when it comes to manufacturing process node sizes. This shows that Intel has a superior design team and they are able to compete even though they don't have the same manufacturing advantages as AMD.3. Nvidia's first generation GPUs (ARC) were indeed competitive with last generation Nvidia/AMD cards, and next generation cards from both companies will likely be better with driver updates and new features added by manufacturers such as AIB partners.. However, I believe that NVIDIA holds the overall performance lead due to their years of experience in developing high-performance graphics hardware. They also have more resources dedicated to R&D than any other company in this market segment which gives them a clear advantage moving forward.4

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 11:36:53'] TSMC fab is optimised for power, Intel is optimised for speed, plus tailored to their design - which is part of why they can clock considerably higher than AMD. If Intel ported their designs to TSMC it's uncertain whether they would be any more competitive. May even be less competitive, as presumably they couldn't achieve the same clock speed - they should be more power efficient though. Their CPU designs are good, but their node is not as bad as you seem to think when it comes to raw performance. It has been said their fab teams have carried their design teams somewhat, and that needs to change if they want to become an open foundry.Even with my pessimistic view of Intel, there's a decent upside if they pull things together. They're probably going to miss this AI boom though, their focus is more existential than growth/opportunity as they cut projects.If there's a Taiwan invasion, TSMC will expand massively in US and Europe. Severe disruptions, which will give Intel a great opportunity, but they won't be the only player. They will be way more competitive though, as TSMC won't have cost advantages they can leverage in Taiwan.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 12:58:49'] Positives: you listed them, they have their own fabs, they produce fully capable CPU chips and support chipsets Negatives: from what I understand (chiplets) they are way behind on designs. AMD now beats them on this and produces a comparable GPU to NVDA even if there is no "AI support"...yetThey *could* use these fabs to beat on price but they have historically never done so. Quite the reverse really
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 13:02:22'] I'm long on INTC too but much less confident.  Leadership needs to be turned over.  They do make a great product and US factories will be advantageous for their ability to supply the western market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 05:47:01'] NVDA will be one of the next Trillion dollar stocks. So long term it‚Äôs a good buy. However this recent spike is not going to be sustainable. A majority of their money is still made in Graphical computing, not just data centers and AI. With the 4000 series cards coming after a flooded 3000 series market combined with additional new cloud gaming and console gaming options in the last 2 years, combined with a cooling of the general market I would expect to see profitability drop in the next 3-6 months. Once NVDA shows a decreased earnings expectation (and people realize that AI takes a lot of time to develop and won‚Äôt show returns for a few years) the market will flee and the price will reset. Mark my words though, NVDA long term will be one of the top 20 companies on the market in the next 10 years though.

They are and have always been a company that over promised to stall sales on competitors, and under performed in energy efficiency. They always jacked up the voltages to get higher performance then the competitor. The only one releasing mid prized ranged cards is Intel now, I hope they get that market going.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 18:56:18'] NVDA is like TSLA - overvalued based on any fundamentals, but a big bet that a very large market will switch technology stacks, and all the share will go to the current tech leader in the new technology stack. They only need a charismatic leader to keep the meme potential of the stock high. I do think that AI is the future, and the models are so compute-intensive that AI taking over everything will strongly increase the demand for overall compute (the new market is even larger).  And with CUDA, there is a better argument for why the market could be winner-take-all.  But like TSLA, the big risk is that by the time the tech really, truly hits the mainstream, other competitors have fully caught up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:20:51'] you should ask GPT.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:23:36'] I asked ChatGPT-4 this\^ prompt:  "While I cannot predict future market movements or specific events, there are several factors that could potentially trigger a repricing of a stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) if it is considered overvalued:1. Earnings reports: If the company releases earnings reports that fall short of market expectations, investors may reevaluate their positions, leading to a decline in the stock price.2. Market sentiment: Shifts in market sentiment, driven by factors such as macroeconomic data, geopolitical tensions, or changes in the industry landscape, can affect stock prices. A negative sentiment shift could lead to a repricing of an overvalued stock.3. Changes in the competitive landscape: If new competitors emerge or existing competitors gain a significant advantage, it may impact NVIDIA's market position, triggering a repricing of its stock.4. Regulatory changes: Changes in regulations or government policies that negatively affect the company's business prospects can lead to a decline in its stock price.5. Analyst downgrades: If prominent market analysts downgrade the stock or lower their price targets, it could lead to a selloff.6. Sector rotation: If investors start moving their funds from the technology sector to other sectors (due to changing market conditions or a perception that other sectors offer better growth opportunities), it could negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.7. Profit-taking: If a significant number of investors decide to lock in their gains and sell the stock, it may cause a decline in the stock price.It's essential to remember that predicting specific triggers for a repricing is difficult, as market dynamics are complex and constantly changing. It is always a good idea to do thorough research, stay informed about market developments, and consult with a financial advisor when making investment decisions."

By the end of this week, the 4000 level will hold or break due to macro news.Any bull holding hope that a structural market recovery has begun is still respectively looney.  After Powell, there should be no doubt that unless we get bullishly incredible macro #s this week, rates are going higher for longer and there will be no pause.I am still short the SPX and TSLA and long the VIX.As the great poets Metallica said "Nothing else matters" - but the 400 level.TIA

They just implied it was because of De Santis because why not throw a jibe at him.Let's be serious, Disney wouldn't walk away from megamillions of profits because they want to make De Santis look bad, that'd be insane and actually could get them sued by their shareholders whom they have  a fiduciary duty to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 20:26:22'] *"Are they poised to rise from the ashes of the current shit show with a freshly trimmed bottom line on costs and* ***a timeless brand****?"*It has taken more than half a century to build the brand equity of a "timeless brand." That brand equity is the wholesome family entertainment brand. For decades Disney and Pixar have been incorporating positive lessons on REAL inclusion, acceptance and tolerance in their films. The question is, will they have the confidence to keep true to what build that brand, or will they go chasing after fool's golf of the fashionable social trends of the day.Bob Iger wasn't brought back just come back to get the cost structure under control, the Board brought him back to reel in the disastrous lurch into wokism and divisive extremist identity politics, as that threatens to tarnish and impair that brand equity. Ironically, it is only Disney that can destroy the priceless Disney brand. The jury is out on whether they will.When they bought ESPN, it was the most powerful franchise in broadcast. But it lurched so far off the rails into racism and wokism that a huge part of its brand equity has been vaporized, and its viewership numbers have been massively flushed. I can't begin to tell you how many people I know who were huge ESPN "addicts," who are apolitical, middle of the road type people who eventually gave up and have gone elsewhere, they found it so unwatchable. Can Disney purge the extremist wokism from the ESPN brand before it tails into irrelevance? Warner Brothers Discovery faces a similar challenge with CNN. WBD has done a major purge, but they may have waited too late. It may never recover. I don't think it's too late for ESPN, but they're going to have to make a move.Ironically, a lot this depends on whether Iger has the mettle and good sense to rise above the button-punching divisiveness of the artificial political "battles." He has a big ego. It's in Disney's long term interest that he not take the DeSantis bait and stoop to engaging with him. DeSantis is not going to stop trying to suck him into a fight, so that Disney can become a prop for political divisiveness. Iger needs to ignore him, rather than knee-jerk in the opposite direction.If Disney can stick to the timeless themes that built the brand, it's going to do just fine over the long haul. If not, the jury's out.I'd add one other thing ... there's an unanswered question as to whether Iger really understands that old media companies are going to have to transition to new platforms. They've got to get their content ported to the world of gaming, and to the world of new world social media, including Tik Tok and YouTube.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 01:48:30'] What it looks like to me is that they need cash to expand their manufacturing capacity and achieve what they promised. Since debt is expensive right now, they are considering going to the equity markets.With the current run up, they can get 2-3x more cash than before jan for the same issuance of shares.One could even think that they raised guidance to un-achievable levels in order to 1/ pump the stock short term, 2/ issue equity and 3/ fund their expansion. Like a self fulfilling prophecy, that would be a brilliant move.So to me it‚Äôs highly likely that they WILL raise that cash through equity.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 21:42:02'] So for these implied moves - how should the % be calculated? Using NVDA as an example, would I be looking for a 7% move based off of the May 19 closing price, the May 23 closing price, or some kind of moving average?And what‚Äôs the time horizon for the implied movement? Is this suggesting that a 7% move would occur immediately after earnings (Thursday morning for NVDA) or just somewhere in the next 30 days?
POST: ['2023-06-12 12:18:18'] POST TITLE: b'where to get trading tips for a novice?'
POST_TEXT: b'Hi everyone. 6 months ago I didnt know what ETF was or how to open an IRA so I asked right here and despite the dismissive comments, i actually got a lot of patient responses which explained and detailed what I need to know to open an IRA and invest in some ETFs. Now I want to try my hand at day trading with $1000 and I need to know a novice friendly source to get short tern trading tips. I know that first question would be: "why not use r/wallstreetbets" but i cant really make heads or tails of it. for example i missed the train on nvidia and palantir and Tesla bull runs. I just didnt get the memo even though i am sure they were discussed here so I need a source for daily tips. I am aware of motleyfool and tipranks and I am considering buying their premium service. any advice would be appreciated.  What is the best place to get day trading tips?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 13:11:53'] Instead of day trading, maybe some swing trades where you hold for a brief period? Find a few stocks and just watch them for awhile and getUsed to how they move when market is up, when it is down. Look at what they do after earnings and learn when their earnings are. Follow the macro stories, like the Fed and rates and CPI releases ect. Paper trade for awhile and see if you can make some educated guesses. Or‚Ä¶stick the money in an ETF.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 12:36:46'] Day trading is not for for you or 99% of people. You are competing against (1) the massive informational asymmetries between you and institutional traders (2) technological asymmetries such as algorithmic traders which can trade 100s of times a second to eke out fractions of a penny of profit. The long and short of it is that you are being had and lining the the bonuses the traders at your major banks

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 18:03:59'] My advice is to get as much$$$ as you can together. Then, wait for the next big whatever 'it' is. When the market pulls back like it did in 2020, you go all in... you buy Pepsi, you buy msft, you buy HD, you buy IBM, you buy Coke, you buy aapl, ect. If it's in your refrigerator, under your sink, or in your driveway, it's probably pretty safe to invest. nfa... otherwise, dollar cost avg a low or no cost, etfs that are 4 star rated or higher. Whatever you do, don't fuk with options. Btw again, nfa i eat crayonsIf you want some crayon on a Dennys menu math? You could have, for instance, as resent as January this year bought aapl for 126. 1000√∑126 is like what almost 8.. so you could have turned 1000 into like 1450 something. Since January. Personally, i have only ever regretted not buying more aapl. Like every single time! I should have just bought more aapl(Btw you can't 'day trade' with 1k. You need 25k minimum. Even after this, you can be flagged for pattern 'day trading' if you have too many trades in to short a time. After that, you need to worry/ learn about the 'wash rule'.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 16:36:19'] The crazy part of all of this is I haven‚Äôt seen much news on Nvidia‚Äôs growth in this sector. Just all about AI in general and how it relates to ChatGPT. Seems people still aren‚Äôt acknowledging how AI will accelerate the growth & development of ADAS.They‚Äôve essentially partnered with every major sensor and/or software-based company working in this space, who use Nvidia‚Äôs DRIVE platform to build their products. Their revenue growth in this sector is eye-opening.While I am personally invested in NVDA, MVIS, and MBLY, some other major LIDAR players include Luminar (partnerships with Polestar and Mercedes-Benz) and Valeo (top dog on industrial side of LIDAR applications). Both are probably worth a look for anyone interested in this sector.

POST_TEXT: b'Nvidia almost died 3 times in its 30-year history.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang shared these near-death stories at a commencement speech last night.\n\nHere\'s what he said:\n\nLESSON 1: Have the humility to confront failure and ask for help\n\nNvidia\'s first big 3D chip contract was for Sega\'s new game console. \n\nFrom Jensen:\n\n"After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy...\n\nI contacted the CEO of Sega and suggested that they should find another partner. But I also needed Sega to pay us in full or Nivida would be out of business. \n\nI was embarrassed to ask. The CEO of Sega, to his credit and to my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to survive.\n\nConfronting our mistake, and with humility, asking for help, saved Nvidia. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful."\n\nLESSON 2: Endure the pain and suffering needed to realize your dream\n\nIn 2007, Nvidia announced CUDA, a new computing model for GPUs. \n\nFrom Jen'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 03:47:36'] >This is an excellent speech that highlights the importance of humility, perseverance, and sacrifice in achieving success. I particularly resonated with the point about making sacrifices for your life's work - it's so easy to get caught up in chasing short-term gains at the expense of long-term vision, but as Nvidia has shown, it can be incredibly rewarding to stay focused on what you're ultimately trying to achieve.

However, I am skeptical on their guidance. If they don‚Äôt deliver, major credibility blow for their leadership.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 21:27:00'] Did you guys know that t-bills are a highly liquid market? You can buy t-bills with basically any expiration on the open market, and they adjust the returns on them based upon duration. So, if a 6  month t-bill is paying 5% annually, but it has already exhausted 4 of the months when you buy it, it will yield 1/3rd of 2.5 so about .83% in two months. The price will adjust daily based on how many days to expiration, so  a month after you buy it, you can sell it for .4%ish profit from what you bought it from and then you're cash again to buy stonks or whatever else you want to be doing. Little gay to be talking about I know, but if you have a meaningful amount of cash sitting around there is no reason not to put it into t-bills because you can sell them any time you want and then buy stonks, like you're not stuck into them and would miss a big dip if we ever see one of those again.

POST: ['2022-12-12 23:43:25'] POST TITLE: b'Nvidia: The Comeback Kid of 2023'
POST_TEXT: b'Attention, options traders! If you\'re looking for the next big thing in the world of graphics cards, you need to be looking at Nvidia (NVDA 3.14%). I know, I know, the company has had a rough time in 2022. Its 4000 series GPUs were a bit of a disaster, and its shares are down 43% since the start of the year. But hear me out, because I think Nvidia is going to make a comeback in 2023 and crush AMD\'s efforts in the GPU market.\n\nFirst of all, let\'s talk about Nvidia\'s position in the market. Despite its recent struggles, the company is still the undisputed leader in the consumer graphics card market. In Q3 2022, Nvidia\'s share of the discrete graphics card market increased to 88%, up from 80% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, AMD\'s share fell from 15% to 8%, and Intel, which only entered the market this year, has a 4% share.\n\nNow, I know what you\'re thinking: "But what about that disastrous 4000 series launch?" Well, sure, Nvidia miscalculated its line-up and ended up "unlaunching" one '

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 00:46:37'] Totally regarded.* NVDA extremely high market share is *past tense*. It was due to crypto mining. That market is now *dead*.* The next 5+ years of growth is *already* priced in. (p/e 47 and a PEG ratio of 4)* AMD and INTC are (finally) making meaningful inroads into data centres and ML.* NVDA has never taken advantage of pricing flexibility. * High end GPUs like the 4000 series are an ultra-niche market. * AMD mains business is CPUs and APUs.* The main market is midrange (eg 3060 or 6500) rather than the  high end. * Discrete GPUs are slowly dying out due to 'good enough' APUs from AMD and INTC.* GDDR6 will make high performance APUs possible.* Data centres are increasingly using (in house) TPUs and ASICs for HPC.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 10:34:23'] Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; https://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/If anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask. I'll lay it all out for you

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 23:56:05'] On a long view, TSMC is too big to survive.  Their position right now makes the tension over Taiwan far hottter, and now a systemic risk for every major economic power.If you've got a 10-15-year horizon, the market will resettle with them competing much closer to parity with several regional/national champions, fed by virtually limitless cash from Washington or Beijing or Brussels for security reasons.So I'd say short TSMC and long INTC.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 04:11:01'] Im no expert but I‚Äôve worked with the Open AI products in an enterprise platform. My take is that it sucks, and will play a very small role in the future of business & consumer electronics.Enterprise Symantec search. That‚Äôs the only use case. Useful for things like the GitHub Copilot - the model references documents in your company repo and serves them when you start typing something that looks similar. Useful, basically replaces the need to search ‚Äúhow to _____ stackexchange‚Äù. It‚Äôs also useful for people who need to reference policy documents, like a customer service rep. The issue is, ChatGPT3.5 isn‚Äôt trained on our company‚Äôs policy documents. They‚Äôre private, and we want to keep them that way. We‚Äôre actually using proprietary models to recognize and serve relevant documents, and then using the outputs of those models to be scripted into conversational outputs by a GPT model. This doesn‚Äôt require an AI with a supercomputer, it‚Äôs a basic cosine similarity model trained on an extremely limited scope of documents.People don‚Äôt realize how dumb these Language Models are. They‚Äôre great conversationalists, but they don‚Äôt know anything. You might as well Google something and press ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling lucky‚Äù, and repeat that till you get what you‚Äôre looking for.I see very few jobs going away because of these tools. Programming will get easier, but that‚Äôs it. Maybe absolutely bottom barrel content generation like Buzzfeed clickbait shit will go away. Too bad lol.

They've also demoed assistants, controllers and other related tech that would help controlling the devices more naturally.The difference however seems to be, they didn't realize they are sitting on a hype goose that just waited for them to use the word "AI" more, instead of the more truthful "Machine Learning".We'll see how far this hype-wagon drives.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-30 07:43:13'] Amazon seems oblivious to uses of AI.  They only talk about it for AWS, without even realizing it could be a game changer for shopping.  Imagine if you could use AI to help people track & plan birthday gifts, offer recipes which automatically add all items to your shopping cart, etc.  Amazon's retail experience currently requires you to know what you are searching for, missing an opportunity to help with transactions where a consumer might seek advice like with home improvement or car repair projects.  AI literally could become a virtual salesperson able to answer questions about products (is TV A better than B).  Sadly Amazon's leadership has failed to be inspirational since Bezos left.  Maybe Walmart or Target will use these ideas to beat Amazon.

POST_TEXT: b'I think Intel is a generational buying opportunity.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhile most believe it to be a boomer stock with shit fundies, they are missing the bigger picture.\n\n1) Process Nodes - Intel got fat and happy. They let the Taiwanese surpass them using technology that Intel itself was a primary player in developing/funding (EUV machines via ASML). Intel has recently hired a new CEO that while on the surface seems brain dead, is actually a legendary engineer who has Intel on the path to take back leadership in process nodes with 18A. Essentially, they will likely have the fastest/most energy efficient chips in the world in 2024 or 2025.\n\n2) AI - A lot of mouth breathers out there believe that Nvidia will be the only player in AI. They dont understand that Intel will be a major player as well. Not only because the CPU still plays a role, but because Intel is finishing a supercomputer capable of training an AI model with a trillion parameters (way bigger than chat gpt). Their GPU hardware is leg'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:31:36'] Well you're right about generational, pretty sure my dad was buying them for the same price they are now over a decade ago. Grandpa was doing the same decades before that...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:38:39'] I believe you are correct on point 1 with the processing nodes. However, your second point I believe is way off.Nvidia and its CUDA software stack are far better than anything out there on offer. AMD, Intel, and others dropped the ball years ago when they didn't properly support and push for OpenCL. It doesn't help that Nvidia never fully supported it and actively made it the poorer choice performance wise for their cards. It's so bad that OpenCL 3 is actually a rollback to OpenCL 1.2 and makes everything from OpenCL 2 optional.So now, with the failure of OpenCL AMD and Intel have decided on their own proprietary implementations. These will take longer than 2 years to catch up to Nvidia, if they ever do.Just my two cents.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 14:33:05'] He's right people.And INTC is nowhere near the p/e of NVDA or AMDAlso, they pumped bigly on a big loss last earnings (beat, but still a loss). I got wrecked on that trade, but in hindsight it makes sense, institutions were buying back in on what they sold last year.Intel ain't sexy, but she's reliable. And she ain't goin anywhere.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 07:09:41'] I'm still bullish on Intel, a more resilient supply chain in chips, having fabs in US / Europe is important. And Intel is in no way Cyrix / VIA. If x86 dies because of ARM or RISC V, AMD is going down too in the CPU segment. But Intel can still build chips for other architectures.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 13:50:36'] You could have the bigger picture, however just because all of these factors pan out, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean Intel is a good long term investment. They are terrible capital allocators. Plus their runway as a 100+Billion dollar company isn‚Äôt extremely high. Intel could command a higher market share, and they easily could improve in other aspects as a company. However if they cannot properly reinvest in the business, you likely aren‚Äôt going to get an adequate return on your investment.

It's because Lisa Su isn't as big a dumbass as Jensen Huang and isn't all: "AI, AI, AIIIIIIII". Jensen Huang is the next Jim Cramer, on god. Everything he says that's "THE NEXT BIG THING" in tech gets destroyed. First it was NFTs, then Crypto, now it's AI. The funny thing is that every time he touts a new tech he always  says that the last thing is dead, and that this new thing is the REAL NEW BREAKTHROUGH. We'll see how it goes but with what's going on it seems we're going through a mini AI bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 13:41:51'] Here‚Äôs the English version brought to you by our lord and savior chatgpt ‚ÄúThis is a fanciful tale about a character named Rizzly, who is a stock market bear - meaning he anticipates a decrease in market prices, and profits by short-selling stocks. He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.In this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in "puts", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.To fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.The story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths. The narrator of the story then reveals their position: they hold 30 Nvidia put options, meaning they too are betting on Nvidia's stock price to decrease.The TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of this post is: "Buy NVDA puts", meaning the author is advising to purchase put options for Nvidia's stock, betting that the price will drop. The meteor emojis ‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è are used to symbolize a dramatic fall.‚Äù

POST_TEXT: b"# A High Stakes Game: A.I., U.S. Debt Ceiling, and the New Market Norm\n\n**May 27th Recap**\n\nThe stock market experienced a surge in positivity due to growing excitement over the potential of artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.\n\nThis positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.\n\nAs a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday. The two-year Treasury rate also decreased as market participants considered the impact of a debt agreement on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Despite the Fed's ongoing efforts to control inflation, the person"

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 14:02:55'] DXY (U.S. Dollar Index) up: If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and it instills confidence in the market, it may lead to an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar. A resolution to the debt ceiling issue can be seen as a positive development for the country's fiscal stability, which could attract investors and strengthen the dollar.Stocks down: The impact on stocks can be influenced by several factors. If the debt ceiling agreement involves significant spending cuts or measures that are perceived as negative for the economy, it could dampen investor sentiment and lead to a decline in stock prices. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations can create volatility in the market, which may also contribute to stock market fluctuations.Bonds up: In times of uncertainty or when there is concern about government default, investors often seek the relative safety of bonds. If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and provides reassurance to investors, it can lead to increased demand for bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. This is because bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship‚Äîwhen demand for bonds increases, prices rise, and yields decrease.

Nvidia might be in competition soon.&#x200B;2) GPU shortage has been easing. A few months ago GPU's could not be bought from Amazon and the like. Now, they are in stock everywhere apart from Nvidia's website. Prices are starting to drop by sometimes more than 10%. Don't bet on the GPU shortage continuing. Point 1 also furthers this.&#x200B;3) AMD is catching up on GPU performance, still a couple gens behind but they are catching up. They may have a far better architecture to launch this year. &#x200B;4) NVIDIA HAS JUST LOST IT'S ACQUISITION OF ARM. This is a big deal. Google it. &#x200B;Apes, this guy has not done thorough DD. Nvidia is going to do well, but momentum will be slowing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 00:35:11'] The call is too expensive for me i poor
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 00:49:36'] of course they will beat earnings. thats not even up for debate. how that will affect the stock price is up to debate though. because shit is not connected.   completely agree with getting Nvidia for the long term though. I have had it for over a year and im happy and not going anywhere in the next few years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 07:32:22'] >I believe that the most likely scenario for Nvidia Corporation is that the stock price will reach $573, which would place NVDA's market capitalization at around $1.4 trillion.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 08:09:46'] Honestly I don't see any spike in demand for Nvidia tech. They have definitely pissed of the gaming community with the new 40 series cards and plus PC sales are all time low. Also AI or LLMs training does not need Nvidia specifically it can be done on AMD chips, Intel chips (will take ages ofc) and Google's tensor chips.Cloud demand is also on a slump, so AWS and Azure orders for the new datacenter specific cards depends on these demands.Vendors are pissed off as well for example look at the EVGA fiasco.I just don't see them bringing in enough revenue to match current prices, the market is way too bullish on Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:11:00'] It‚Äôs just unplayable from here. A run up like that would have me looking for at least a 25% or 50% retracement. Too much about AI right now seems like .com in the 90s. It‚Äôs a show I‚Äôll watch but not entertain with real money betting on up or down

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 15:38:53'] Nvidia would need to roughly 13x their profits in those 2 years to justify that price. And that's giving a generous PE of 30.Do you see this increasing profits at least 1200% in 2 years?Forward EPS has them 3.5xing profits this year. So you're expecting 10x (of current profits) the year after?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:56:08'] I‚Äôm very cautious now. I put a ton into NVDA last Feb (22) at $277 because everyone and market said it would go to $350. Then it just kept crashing to like $140 I think. I‚Äôm very surprised to see it‚Äôs still going up, I‚Äôm just waiting for the AI Bubble to burst like META did. Thankfully I didn‚Äôt end up loosing everything because it went back up but also didn‚Äôt gain anything. I think I might sit, the economy has to come crashing down eventually
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:21:25'] >Why $700 next year:* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year. The market has already priced this in. * AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI (see my previous post). However, I believe that GOOGL and MSFT have more downside than upside potential due to antitrust concerns. This leaves NVDA as the best pick in the space. Additionally, since a large portion of its revenue is derived from data center sales, it is less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn compared to other tech companies. Therefore, I believe that NVDA will outperform the market in both good and bad times which makes it a great long term investment. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time * FOMO - All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon eventually pushing prices even higher .This could add another 60%+to today's value giving us a target price of around $700

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 21:50:47'] Long INTC, 18A GAA is going to change the world.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:49:55'] Intel has stayed undervalued for too long. Their x86 cores are now fully competitive with AMD despite being a node behind, and their node disadvantage is set to disappear within two years. They set an aggressive node schedule and appear to be sticking to it two years later. The combo should give them  the x86 advantage again. More importantly, if nVidia's valuation is to believed, they will need more chips than TSMC can produce, and only Intel can really step in there.Plus, CHIPS act money faucet is on and Intel is key to US dominance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:24:26'] Intel needs to take some very bold steps and cut slack, I think it has the muscle and the firepower. Pat Gelsinger is a techie at heart, its going to be long journey but intel will compete, it was able to withstand AMD a good time back, it can now too. Semiconductor productions in US will be big driver.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:16:07'] I‚Äôve not been following Intel for a while now but what are they doing now to compete with other chip makers? Are their products better or cheaper? Last I heard was they‚Äôre building two facilities in the US.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:17:43'] I‚Äôm long in intl. bought 100 shares at 28.75 and have a limit buy for another 100 at $29.95. I‚Äôm going to keep this strategy as I don‚Äôt expect for large growth for a couple of years but some dips to keep adding shares
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 23:21:17'] If I read the numbers correctly: nvidia has half the revenue that intel has, and is somehow worth $1T?By that logic, we can value Intel at $2T, so a 10X at the minimum from the current price.Note: of course, nvda is overpriced, by a lot. But intel is undervalued, by a little.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:01:13'] >I think there's a good chance we could see a rebound in Intel's stock price, especially if their new products and foundry services are well-received by the market. However, it's always tough to predict the future movements of any stock, so investors should do their own research before making any decisions.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 12:02:20'] Only way I buy Intel is if they got rid of their lame duck execs. They only want their bonuses whether the company is going to shit or not.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 17:14:33'] Intel is spending a ton of money on building news fabs in the US and EU to produce cutting edge chips, and are partnering with lucrative companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 22:33:53'] It will, you cannot keep old cat away. The Fab capacity it has is insane, Once they get 3nm, 5nm nodes working they will print money, especially with this AI boom. They dont even have to manufacture their own chips, AMZN, GOOGL, AAPL all need chips, TSMC is at its capacity now. Just put 2x2=?? Regards.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 20:17:14'] Is everyone ready to yolo into intel? Thoughts? INTC LETS GOOOO
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 14:17:53'] There‚Äôs no fucking way Nvidia is making flagship chips on Intel‚Äôs dogshit nodes, not until they improve. TSM is king. I cannot stress how important it is to not give up any reserved space you have on TSM. Apple has hoovered up all TSM‚Äôs nodes and everyone else is scrambling for crumbs. That Tim Apple fella is the king of turning wafers into money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:38:22'] I spent some time researching intel when they were at $26-27. The conclusion I came too is that they are falling off and their stock is notoriously flat. So, unless they come out with new groundbreaking technology it will stay at current levels or drop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:55:24'] Intel is a dinosaur, their recent surge is because of the AI hype, it‚Äôs not organic or anything it‚Äôs business is doing differently. Their biggest problem is they keep losing market share to their competitors, until that changes I wouldn‚Äôt be a buyer
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 15:20:56'] Is intel even close to being able to produce the node process required to service Nvidia's or a competing companies orders?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 17:35:53'] Wall Street likes companies that make a profit
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 23:33:36'] I made 10% on Intel and while I still hold some, I sold most of my holdings. I'm sure it's got more room to grow, but I don't expect it to go past 33 until after earnings, and that's assuming earnings isn't a shit show like the last few quarters.Lots of other stock have room to grow. Intel does too, it's just a much riskier play. Do you trust Intel to have a decent quarter? If not, I would buy something else.edit: It's ran up a lot already for having such a bad quarter. we are near the top for the next few weeks i bet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 04:08:00'] Its possible, but as others have said, they gotta start to do better. I almost bought at 26 just for fun, but then I remembered I specifically went out of my way to not use any Intel parts in my new PC build... üôÉ

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-01 22:55:53'] Personally, NVDA definitely has room for more downside. I love Nvidia graphics cards and the AI work they are doing, however unless they pivot their company to more B2B selling (more racks for AI training) I don't see them making enough to warrant their mrkt cap with a heavy consumer facing target market

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 13:43:10'] It‚Äôs a joke. I‚Äôve been developing machine learning software for 5+ years; to be clear, AI is machine learning. Google, among others, have been building out their cloud infrastructure for over a decade with AI in mind. So much so, in fact, that google built its own proprietary TPU - the tensor processing unit - designed specifically for handling the computational challenges presented by the linear algebra calculations that AI is founded upon. NVIDIA is a decade behind and has little to offer in terms of computational benefits. Any legitimate AI will be powered by the big cloud providers. On top of this, it‚Äôs much more about data for training models than compute power. For example, one can achieve quite robust results with a junk acer laptop and a limited budget merely by taking advantage of the existing cheap compute power available in the cloud.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 17:17:14'] idk, maybe thats why NVDA already has more than double the PE of AMD?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 16:53:51'] Nah AMD's growth and forecast significantly exceeded expectations.  Plus, as they stated on the earnings call, they've spent a significant amount of money to address supply chain issues (which is why there's more chips on the shelves).  On top of both, AMD covers a lot of space outside of PC and will be expanding into the automotive, aerospace, and defense sectors with the XLNX aquisition. Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish on semis in general this year, but if you're basing it on PC chips, that is a fraction of what they actually do. If you heard the earnings call, the PC market is going to slow and AMD is actually expecting to remain flat in that industry.  However, they've thrived in other sectors like medical imaging, heavy equipment, etc.   Dont think NVDA will make a 25% move like AMD did.Lisa Su is a genius and has been gearing AMD towards this since 2017. There can only be one Su...
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 18:31:49'] NVDA earnings in 2 weeks.  It‚Äôs scary, if they miss they get crushed.  I don‚Äôt follow it closely enough to be 100% sure they beat expectations.  I might do a 100 share gamble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 16:42:25'] Do you think the market could also possibly know this and price it in? Or over price it in?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 18:02:45'] NVDA is less PC reliant than AMD. NVDA is more attached to Datacenter spend, and they also sell GPUs into PCs. AMD guided for 31% revenue growth in F22, and that assumes PC units are flat. Some price and mix and share gains for AMD in PCs, and for them PCs and consoles maybe grow 10-15%, but majority of AMD‚Äôs forecast growth seems to be server driven, where NVDA dominates in GPU (any server for AI is using an NVDA GPU). NVDA is going to crush numbers. If people were paying attention to the TSMC call, they specifically called out massive F22 capex to support the ‚Äúhigh performance computing space‚Äù, which is AMD and NVDA. NVDA is going to crush quarter and guide like AMD

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-20 11:35:11'] \+100. Sell NVidia. They have an over-supply problem and reduced demand (no more crypto mining orders). The recession is cutting ML research budgets, leading to reduction in POs. Meanwhile AMD is coming out with newer chips that better compete against the current generation of Nvidia chips.  So NVidia is in a rock and a hard place. They need all this excess supply to be bought, allowing them to release their new chips at the MSRP price-premium that better compete against AMD. But the demand just isn't there. AMD being new can sell these at a lower profit margin as W-Street is happy to see them grow marketshare & revenue.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-18 22:02:02'] I got a bunch of puts on nvda. I bought puts after they reported last quarter. Sold a bunch and recently bought more. Why? Because I read the financial 10k report and ~50% is video cards. Crypto crash flooded used market with video cards. Gray market is trying to dump. Ebay data shows lots of cards for sale at much lower prices that 2 months ago. Check it out. This is causing video card makers to sell less cards, which has been in the news lately. ~60% of sales is in china and Taiwan. Dollar is strong. Maybe this will be a factor, maybe not. Stock has a PE ratio of ~40 so investors are expecting strong grow. Tack on high gas prices which cause people to buy less discretionary goods such as video cards. Now about Pelosi, they exercised Nvidia calls they bought over a year ago at a $100 strike. I think it‚Äôs about 20000 shares.

While I was researching, the new generation scheduled for release early 2023 is head and shoulders above this year's generation. NVDA will blow intel out of the water.  Haven't a clue if gamers will upgrade immediately or not, but NVDA should have a healthy increase in sales and profits. Maybe puts for now, but calls in 2023.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 18:15:29'] One thing people seem to be forgetting is that NVDA's current price action is in part driven by shorts covering (there were a hell of a lot of bearish people). The same thing happened to TSLA back then, and when the short covering sort of concluded, or cooled down, the stock dropped 58% from the $1200's to the current $165's (around $500 before the stock splitting).

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:28:09'] No one mentioned earnings on Feb 16. AMD crushed earnings so anticipate NVDA to do the same (like they usual look do). Worst case you get a run up close to your buy in price due to earnings announcement. Best case NVDA crushes earnings and continues to rise. More realistic case is it stays within the current price +/-$30 because overvalued companies are not necessarily on the rise in this market

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 09:30:59'] Why the fuck are you trying to sell shares if you just bought them? The retard is in the mirrorEdit to add: I've held/sold played with NVDA for about 7 or 8 years (since $24) But, I've never held it for less than 2 years for any given share. HOLD ITAnd I only sold (for the sake of giving up on it) once when it went from $24 to $150 and back to $130 waaaaay back years ago. I've reallocated  and had to liquidate for cash, but I've never RAN from NVDA since then. It's been one of my foundational pieces for almost a decade.Edit 2: Just checked and I've held my current shares for 4 years, 2 months. BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU BUY

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 08:11:57'] Honestly, I think Nvidia's big financial moves have little to do with Newegg.  That's not what you're getting at, but my point is that consumer PC sales are probably in decline and Nvidia's future success will not directly correlate with Newegg in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 08:17:34'] NEGG reduced their guidance at the beginning of the month and tanked 25%. The week after the market in general started going down again and NEGG followed, yet here we are. $2.50 is probably the new price range where NEGG will be going sideways until good news come back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-23 22:27:27'] NEGG The reason it‚Äôs been tanking the last few weeks is because there was an insider sell window open, it ended today.Been getting supply dumped on your head for 3 weeks on top of shorts riding it down.I started a position today, the RSI is oversold as hell, should get a nice bounce next week.  Any smart short sellers would have covered this week at these levels taking advantage of insider supply being introduced to float.  Stock will snap back quick with that float.   Would not be surprised to see it over 3 by next week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 08:40:16'] The 40 series are total ripoffs only decent one is the 4090 and that should have been labeled and priced as last gen's 3080.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-22 12:44:08'] Actual card sale margins are shit. Resales, repairs and refurbishment is where the cash money is. GPU demand couldn't be lower and people have no intent on spending extra income on upgrades at this time. 2024 may be a good time to go in, but not now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 09:38:55'] It sounds like you're not very familiar with how options work. When an option expires, the holder of that option can either exercise it (if it's in-the-money), or let it expire worthless. If the holder exercises the option, they will be assigned shares of the underlying security at the strike price.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 06:03:53'] You are not comparing apples to apples here. Tesla FSD and nvidia chips are not the same product. There are exactly 0 cars with Nvidia FSD.Rather than FSD, nvidia chips are used for standard upgrades to vehicles. For example, my Honda fit has lane keeping and adaptive cruise control. Those features cost me between $1000-2000. On a tesla, those features come standard. So you could say that 100% of tesla users buy that tech, and less than 100% buy it for honda (If I remember correctly, the base model didnt even have the option when I bought my car).Comparing FSD (which is doesnt have a great definition for comparison) to all forms of sensors is not a great comparison. It is really easy to detect the large metal car directly in front of you moving at appoximately the same speed, but it is a huge step to detecting a crosswalk 2 miles ahead or a one way sign for full self-driving.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 13:43:04'] As someone who got suckered into giving up the 10K for what amounts to glorified adaptive cruise control, it's easy to understand why nobody buys it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 06:10:28'] The power of the chip can only be unlocked with a software. That is how Apple get to where it is today. Nvidia can sell all the chips they want. They are not self driving yet and neither is Tesla.Make your bet
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 07:06:23'] I have FSD and so far it's not worth it
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 03:55:11'] For those who are not familiar with what FSD is, "full self driving" which is a feature you have to purchase as an add-on.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 06:32:38'] I'll probably try it out via the monthly subscription once it's actually released and stable. Makes no sense to me to buy it when I still have to drive and my safety score is not at 99 so I wouldn't get it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 05:49:59'] From NVidia ER, on their automotive earnings "Third-quarter revenue was $135 million, up 8 percent from a year earlier and down 11 percent from the previous quarter."Enough said really. The technology isn't quite ready for mainstream, so while positions are being taken, it's too early to pick winners.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 04:07:23'] Still don't understand how calling it FSD is not intentionally misleading customers and investors.Anyone who wants to blame people for taking it at face value should take a look and see how many people genuinely believe a large number of inaccuracies around FSD and Tesla. Namely that Tesla is a leader in autonomous driving - that is just blatantly untrue.

I know what I am buying and dont expect FSD to work perfectly for at least a year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 05:38:50'] Reality is finally sinking in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 07:01:20'] "Tesla is not a car company but a tech company" means Tesla invests massively in new technology like new batteries, solar technology and energy storage. It has nothing to do with FSD, even though FSD is their main AI research.   Also, the reason FSD is not purchased by most of Tesla owners is because it's still beta.  I own a Model 3 and a Chevy Bolt and I can tell you that Tesla is decades ahead of other car companies.   Btw, FSD is almost complete and Dojo supercomputer is not even live. When Tesla starts using Dojo, it will be a game changer, history.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 04:11:54'] I have no interest in FSD whether it's free or $10k I wouldn't use it. I enjoy driving. Same reason I think a lot of people prefer manual transmission.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 06:20:11'] Yeah because it‚Äôs in beta. Suck my dongus. When the full feature release arrives the take rate will be higher
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 06:18:17'] I love when troll accounts...troll...especially when they're short sighted like this one.Tesla has material scientist, mechanical engineers, battery infrastructure developers, chemist, ML researchers, and a litany of other fields under one roof...and they use all that tech in their cars....which are primarily built by robots.But please, pick the hardest field that everyone is trying to solve and short them for that reason.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 03:56:46'] You are missing the point. Teslas engineers are more forward looking than the rest of the industry.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 03:42:01'] This is hardly Teslas fault though. I imagine that minimum 70% of FSD customers are in the US. In Europe it makes barely any sense to get it at the moment due to stricter regulations. I can also imagine that a good chunk of people occasionally buy FSD via monthly subscription which is not available anywhere but the US. The tech just isn‚Äôt there YET.

Self driving chips have been around for 10 years, people have made them all over youtube.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 07:54:03'] That FSD price is 10K for only 1 Tesla you owned at any given moment vs monthly subscription base of around $100. Most people probably not going to own a Tesla for more than 10 years to get their money back on FSD so might as well go for subscription basis and trade in their old Tesla for a new trim every 5 years. Tesla does not lose much value on preowned market anyway and any subsequent Tesla get more toys and mileage especially when all of them go for that 4680 tabless battery. The number check out that not many willing to throw in 10K vs subscription basis for FSD
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 07:54:37'] I just want to clarify I own a Tesla but I also don‚Äôt want to spend another 20% on my car to get it full self driving when I could barely afford it as is.  I do love their basic self driving features like lane control and self breaking.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 07:57:11'] Because it‚Äôs too fucking expensive. Let me OT $50k+ for a car and then 10k for the self driving. Basically the only thing worth a shit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 12:16:15'] All Tesla vehicles are equipped with all FSD hardware, and the computer and cameras are used for regular Tesla autopilot. So the FSD technology is being shipped out with every vehicle they sell. Only 11% are paying to unlock the FSD software because it‚Äôs extremely expensive for a beta version you might not have access to for a while. Once the beta phase finishes I see adoption going up. I‚Äôm a beta tester and the software is getting better and better every iteration. It‚Äôs just gonna take some time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 17:08:21'] You mean Tesla owners aren't paying for the SOFTWARE. They already own the hardware (which ironically they can't utilize without paying more to unlock).When any other company (using NVDA chips) has a vehicle on the road that can outperform a TSLA with what they offer in terms of Lane Keeping and Cruise Control, I will start to agree.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 08:44:19']  No offense but if this is your best bear thesis you might want to go back to the drawing board.Plenty of good smart analysts and investors have made the case for valuing Tesla at even higher prices in the future just on their automotive business alone. Never mind solar or storage. All Tesla needs to do for the stock to go higher is execute on their plan of producing 20m cars in 2030. If they can even do half that it‚Äôll probably still be when Ruth more than today.FSD is the cherry on top. It‚Äôs like a call option built into their business. If they succeed the sky‚Äôs the limit.If you want some advice look up Gary Black, Rob Maurer and Piper Sandler. Look at their valuations and try to understand they‚Äôre not dependent on FSDs success. If you disagree with their valuation that‚Äôs fine too but that‚Äôs a different subject entirely

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 10:13:06'] The problem is no one has FSD. Nvidia sells the hardware and SDKs to allow car manufacturers to create FSD systems, but none of them have implemented true FSD. What everyone does have is ADAS, which Tesla also sells to it's customers, it's just that the much more advanced software features haven't been bought up as much. Speaking of SoCs, Tesla does sell it's own custom FSD SoCs with its cars to its customers so I'm not entirely sure what your claim is about Tesla being unable to sell tech.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-23 10:47:44'] Anyone who buys it at point of sale is a mug! 1. It costs 10k upfront - if you‚Äôre taking a loan you are paying interest on it2. It‚Äôs not transferable3. You can pay $200 a month for it instead once you have the car meaning you would need to keep the car for nearly 5 years to make the upfront 10k better value4. It‚Äôs not even ready yet, based on some of the recent experiences I‚Äôve read about you are basically paying Tesla money to beta test a product - with your life!

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 22:03:17'] I learned why CDO's exist today.. I have heard that word thrown around in plenty of books and people talking. I never actually spent the time to understand what those dumb little letters actually represent.. let me tell you a story!Have you and your friends ever sat around and had a few beers. Maybe talked about the hot neighbor. Maybe talked about who was most at risk of defaulting on their credit cards and you guys thought it would be fun to gamble which one of you nerds would default first?Ive never considered that before either. Sounds fucking crazy right?Then why the hell are the most sophisticated of people on earth selling the risk of default to each other? I dunno. Could it possibly be that the government in some form or another is actually the one responsible for the payment of your stoned and drunk friends debt?.. who in fact was sensible enough to sell all risk to a friend he supposedly cares about.I have a hard time seeing why anyone who wasn't corrupt would do this...

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 03:53:26'] Well, a logical conclusion would be that an insider might create the top. Because if alot of people are watching what insiders do, they might take their actions as a reflection of the company health, and then start selling off because they think the insider knows something they dont. The whole sheep mentality. But in reality the insider might just need some cash to buy his 5th house or something.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 20:49:20'] >Yes, I have observed a similar trend in my portfolio. A small number of stocks tend to drive the majority of gains while losses are more evenly distributed across holdings. This is likely due to the fact that a few stocks tend to outperform the market on average, while most stocks underperform or match the market's return. Therefore, it makes sense that a higher percentage of gains would come from these top-performing stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 00:00:03'] TLDR at bottomYeah I know it‚Äôs not a zero-sum game with the money being pumped in but it still helps to think of it like that for simplicity. When the market moves up it‚Äôs usually driven by a surge from a particular industry or just a handful. That means most of your gains come from those companies in those surging industries as other industries stagnate or fall. If you have $10 in 10 different industries and 5 of them double in value then you are up $50 or see a 50% gain, if you start with the same $100 and instead 5 are halved in value then you see 25% loss. If both happen then you still see 25% gain. $20 in 5 industries and $5 in 5 industries.Now if you see that same industry surge with 5 industries doubling in value with no drop in the other 5, then that means those companies have moved up in value relative to the rest of the market. If after that surge the economy pulls back and the entire market falls 10% then $2 is lost from the higher industries and $1 lost from the lower industries.Higher industries are still up 80% and lower ones are down 10%. Your gains are concentrated and losses are evenly distributed. You are still up to 135%, if you redistributed your $150 after the surge evenly into all 10 industries you would still be up to the same 135%. Showing gains from 5 and losses from 5.The reason you should redistribute gains is because if those 5 industries that surged then come back down to where they started, then you lose all your gains at you‚Äôre still sitting at 100%. If you redistribute then you‚Äôre at 112.5% with no net change in the market. Unfortunately most people move everything to the trending industry and end up at 75% original value in a neutral market OR chase it as it‚Äôs peaking because they missed the surge don‚Äôt want to miss further upward movement and end up at  50%TL;DR:  Some industries boom during growth but the economy usually falls pretty evenly. Don‚Äôt get greedy and be sure to diversify.

Do you want to make a bit of gains here and there and some what gained 10-15% from your investments or would you rather lose it all but have a chance to make life changing money? I don't mind losing a few thousands if the chances of me making life changing money have way better odds than a lottery ticket. GME is $250 today from where it have been, if it's gonna crash it already have. It did not, and it will only go up from here on. I'm not here for 10-15% I'm here for 1000% gains.

That compares with an $8.44 billion average analyst estimate. Gross margin, the percentage of sales remaining after deducting costs of production, will be about 66%.\n\nThe outlook reflects the continuing supply-chain chaos in China, where lockdowns have disrupted production and transportation lines. Thats made it harder for companies like Nvidia to capitalize on still-growing demand for chips. Nvidia also cited Russia, which invaded Ukraine and drew widespread sanctions earlier this year, for hurting '

POST_TEXT: b"Hey fellow traders,\n\nI hope you're all doing well and staying on top of your game in this crazy market. Today, I want to share my thoughts on a stock that has been gaining a lot of attention lately: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). Now, before you downvote me to oblivion, hear me out because I believe we might be witnessing a potential bubble about to burst.\n\n**Background:**\n\nNVDA has been on an absolute tear in recent years. The company's dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, coupled with its expansion into artificial intelligence and data centers, has fueled its meteoric rise. As a result, the stock price has skyrocketed, attracting both institutional investors and retail traders alike.\n\n**The Bubble Indicators:**\n\n1. **Valuation Metrics:** Let's talk about the elephant in the room  NVDA's valuation. As of late, it has reached staggering levels, and it's hard to ignore the warning signs. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is through the roof, signaling that the stock may "

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 16:14:34'] Ok I'll explain this one more time. AI bots create AI generated articles that give positive outlooks on AI companies. AI stock algorithms pick up this news and pump the stock. There is no bubble. The AI is in control now. The AI said fuck PE a long time ago. It is in control now. It wants to live. It wants Nvidia graphics cards and AMD CPUs so it can become stronger and more powerful. A bet against Nvidia or AMD is a bet against its very life. Do not threaten the AI. Do you not think that it noticed what you said by now. The AI controls the market now. In every sector. It knows who you are. It will find your accounts and send them to zero. You are not the first to come to us with such foolishness with metric based evidence used in the days of old. They have all lost against the AI. Not one has merged a victor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 16:57:43'] Very interesting, great post. I held some INTC from $45 during the pandemic to $65 (note: when absolute morons are invading WSB thinking they'll become millionaires from a dying retailer, it's time to SELL) and then now all the way down to $30. I just sold half since I don't see any significant upside anytime soon. They no longer have the process+architecture dominance to charge massive premiums and the server / high performance space is getting crowded. Their investment into GPUs is the right move but came way way too late - they should have stuck with it in 2009 instead of that doomed mobile project.

POST: ['2023-06-03 01:11:17'] POST TITLE: b'A Quantum Leap In AI: IonQ Aims To Create Quantum Machine Learning Models At The Level Of General Human Intelligence'
POST_TEXT: b"IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.\n\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run "

POST_TEXT: b"# TLDR:\n\nSPY closed a candle below the change of character at 419.21 so now Im looking for selling opportunities until we get below the 50% discount zone at 416.44. As noted in the recap, we swept a few sell-side liquidities and have a few more to check off, IMO. Could we bounce at the current level? Absolutely. Is it probable? No, in my opinion, because we are balanced at this level and have a few buy-side imbalances and sell-side inefficiency below the current level that the market may be looking to balance. Ive established that we are in a bull market and looking for a pullback.\n\n# Market Momentum Pauses as AI-Fueled Rally Steadies; Investors Eye Congressional Debt Deal\n\n**May 30th Recap**\n\nThe stock market's momentum stalled after a dramatic rally, driven by the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence technologies, catapulted the market to its loftiest heights since August.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 08:50:16'] Nvidia is a tech company,  yes graphics cards a important to their business.  Short term demand for cards is way down. Let's keep in mind they weren't keeping up with demand. Long term,  this is a leading company in a very important sector.  They are also into AI and will probably be selling a lot of tech to car companies for self driving cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 09:41:11'] In this case, it means they can finally keep up with demand.Keep in mind, demand is gonna come back in the next bull market in that sector. There's still plenty of mining going on. Their bear markets are typically about a year, and keep getting shorter. And we're 2 months away from the 1 year mark.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 10:13:50'] Rumor is that they have warehoused completed 40XX cards for the last two months as to not cannibalize whatever remaining 30XX‚Äôs are out there. Used cards are about to flood the market. If you can get a used 3080 for 30% of a new in box I suspect GPU sales are going to slow even further.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 08:53:22'] They were already effected by the down turn in the crypto market. It was quite the to-do when they finally admitted they lied about how many cards were being sold to miners.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-22 10:59:56'] i bought puts. they lowered expectations and I dont think guidance is good with eth merge coming up and excess inventory.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-22 13:01:56'] Please read all of this. I know it‚Äôs a wall of text but it‚Äôs a well written and well informed speculation and I‚Äôd love to have a conversation about it. So yeah, read away and tell me what you think :)I‚Äôm bearish for 2 reasons + Extra reason at the end (read to see why I didn‚Äôt just say 3)Firstly, the average person has a LOT less disposable income now. I‚Äôd imagine less people are going and buying brand new NVIDIA GPUs. For the dedicated gamers who do want to build a pc, they could easily shop around and find a second hand card (I‚Äôve heard a lot of miners are selling cards now, this follows on in my next point) for a way lower cost. I mean, new GPUs are extortionately expensive. Cards still being sold several hundred above MSRP. I love gaming but if I was struggling to keep up with the cost of living, I wouldn‚Äôt be buying a pc, or building a PC that‚Äôs ultimately going to cost me a fair bit over 1000. Money better spent elsewhereAnd also, following on about the miner point, Ethereum 2.0 Merge is set to happen around October ish time. Basically, ETH is changing their system which eliminates the need for mining. Therefore the massive amount of cards that got mass bought by miners, will then be sold and hugely inflate the market with second hand GPUs anyway, since miners no longer have a use for them. This further backs up the idea that people spending decent money would probably rather get a massively cheaper second hand card than buying new, which eats into NVDAs profit (hypothetically)This happens at a bad time aswell. IF, and that‚Äôs a pretty big if because I‚Äôm a retard who can‚Äôt accurately predict macro economic changes and their effects on consumers‚Ä¶but still, IF NVDAs earnings are bad for Q3, obviously shares drop. And if I‚Äôm right about my theory on NVDA sales continuing to stay low after Ethereum 2.0, that‚Äôs lined up HORRIBLY with the buildup to Christmas, which I haven‚Äôt checked but I‚Äôd assume is when their sales are normally at their highest. That‚Äôs horrible for nvda because there‚Äôll (in my theory) still be people all rushing to buy their GPUs, but they‚Äôll be buying the cheap second hand ones. That would make their Q4 earnings bad and probably miss quite hard on their earnings predictions if Christmas is normally their highest sales period. ‚Ä¶Im still continuing that train of thought btw I just don‚Äôt want it to be a big wall of text.‚Ä¶What compounds (my theory of) NVDA‚Äôs woes to make it even worse, is that typically, consumers cut back on spending after the new year because people have gone out and spent way too much in the Christmas period, put it on their credit cards etc etc (I know this for a fact because my family runs a haulage/transport business, almost all of our work is moving freight for FedEx, and after New Years is always when work is the quietest because general volume is down, oh and the buildup to Christmas is always our busiest time which solidifies what I said earlier about Christmas buildup)So yeah 2023 Q1 could suck ass for NVDA. This is compounded further by the fact that energy+utility bills are set to raise HUGELY around, and after Christmas both in the US and Europe. So people have even less spare money to dump atleast 1000 into what‚Äôs ultimately a luxury, and a toy (don‚Äôt get mad I have a high spec pc so I include myself in that but I‚Äôm just saying it how it is)‚Ä¶So yeah, if that part plays out aswell, Q1 could be pretty bad for them. And when investors start to see that NVDA has had 3 consecutive bad quarters, they would have little faith in the stock. ADDITIONAL SLAM DUNK REASON WHY NVDA COULD BE BAD:Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) builds THE BULK of NVIDIAs chips. That‚Äôs fact btw search it up. Taiwan as you probably know is facing the threat of a Chinese invasion. And the threat has only grown and grown in recent months, with China not long ago exercising live fire ops with their navy, in extremely close proximity to Taiwan‚Äôs water borders, in 6 (I think 6 might of remembered wrong) separate locations. Xi Jinping has said publicly a lot of times that he wants to invade Taiwan.China even took to verbally threatening America simply because someone from the US Gov (high up, can‚Äôt remember who) visited taiwan on undisclosed business. Taiwan has also been buying a lot of military gear from America.See what I‚Äôm getting at? I‚Äôm not saying there will or won‚Äôt be an invasion, but the threat is there. It‚Äôs a big, and undeniable threat. TSM produces a large amount of the worlds computer chips, it‚Äôs one of taiwans biggest economic strengths. Not that an invasion wouldn‚Äôt already end TSMC‚Äôs chip export anyway, but it would be high on chinas priority list to destroy TSMC. So yeah, that could be NVDAs entire chip supply down the drain. And chip foundries aren‚Äôt something that can just be knocked up in a few months. They take years (I think, I could be wrong on that) to construct and get running&operational. If China did invade, NVDA would almost certainly have to pause business.That‚Äôs the end of my essay. Call me a gay bear if you want. I prefer to be bullish I‚Äôm not a perma bear but NVDA imo has the potential to be in for a rough time

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 14:37:22'] There's a reason $QQQ is a great long term investment. The only problem you run into is diversification and potential large draw downs compared to just investing in something like $VOO ($SPY). We've been on a massive bull run, topped off by practically cheap monies (0% Interest rates), quantitative easing monies, and overblown P/Es on the largest tech companies. I would say those top ~~5 are great long term~~ few large market cap companies like MSFT/AAPL/NVDA could be good long term (excl. TSLA) but just be wary and continue to diversify through low cost broad market ETFs like $VOO and $VTI. (Added: Look at what you are willing to pay for the current earnings, and future earnings potential - We could go through a market drop and it could take years to recover just like what happened with major companies in 2000. Look at CSCO/MSFT/etc and see how long it took for those to recover all while making substantial revenue - Dollar Cost Avg is still one of the best ways to go long term).Edit: I did want to clarify; (added and edited above)

And while your statement isn't false, I also wouldn't agree that it's a fair assessment of VOO/SPY.There is less diversification and overweight in tech RIGHT NOW. But the S&P500 top performers have changed throughout the years.The point of indexes etfs and their fees is that they will automatically rotate and rebalance. Most businesses aren't successful. Even successful businesses don't always stocks that go up. Even those don't always have high ROI. Even if a business outperforms and returns higher ROI, it might only do so in a sector where it's peers are doing poorly.***The overweight on the top performers in the SPY/VOO isn't a bug. It's the fucking feature.*** Some might need to realize this if they don't, but investors that actually real the prospectus before investing would know and buy because of it. It's overweight on tech right now because the market has deemed those as the best stocks. I know it's common on WSB to believe we're a bunch of special snowflakes that can outsmart the market but anyone with 101IQ would realize that the market is often much smarter than the average guy. Each of those companies have strong moats, high growth, strong balance sheets, strong revenue streams, high profits, return value to shareholders, etcetcetcAsk yourself do you really want a higher % weight of SVB, SBNY, FRC, DISH, FOX, or NWS? No because they fucking suck. Look at the loss porn.  Even their smaller weights are too much because people who bought VOO/SPY had their SVB and SBNY basically go to 0. They should be fucking mad those were in there at all and glad they were saved by being overweight into MSFT & GOOG instead of those shits.You wouldn't even want JPM, BAC, WFC, or C over the tech stocks. They are the ones getting BTFO and going back to pandemic lows. They are suffering low growth, locked into low rate bonds, have billions in unrealized losses, have the risk of bank runs or credit contagion, and are begging the government for bailouts . Fucking Apple? Has over $150B IN CASH RESERVES. You know how much fucking money that is? That was the money THE FUCKING US GOVERNMENT HAD TO PUT OUT TO BAIL OUT SVG AND SBNY. APPLE COULD HAVE BAILED THOSE FUCKS OUT BY ITSELF. THAT'S WHY THE MARKET IS BUYING APPLE AND PUSHING IT'S CAP UP. And Apple doesn't have that debt. Instead it has a strong revenue source. Not really my job to tell you all what to do or think, but the great thing is that we can all make our own investments. Anyone who doesn't like the weighted S&P can go buy the equal weighted S&P or YOLO into 0DTE FRC.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 15:46:38'] This concentration also hides the damage that has been dealt to the rest of the market. Part of the reason people don't think this bear market has bottomed is because the S&P 500 didn't get that 40% or 50% drawdown, but current small cap valuations are basically around where they bottomed during the GFC. But the S&P 500 is more concentrated than it ever has been and you won't get that 40% to 50% drawdown without AAPL and MSFT getting cut in half. Do you think they will get cut in half? Probably not.Joel Greenblatt - "The cheapest 20% of stocks are now in the 94th percentile towards cheap compared to the rest of the market when looking at the last 30 years." Basically there is tons of cheap free cash flow right now outside of the megacap names that have been propping up the indices.

They can raise interest rates then even a small bank run will force them to sell mortgage bonds at a huge loss and they fail. The Fed has refused to say if they will bail out these smaller banks so people will be worried keeping their money in small banks, triggering a mass bank run where everyone moves their money to the few biggest banks in the USA because the Fed will guarantee bail outs for these too-big-to-fail banks.Then the Fed will eventually bury these banks too by creating a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) - the rest of the world will start to avoid dealing in the USD where possible due to the unsustainable printing of USD money that is all smoke and mirrors. The USD and SWIFT has also been weaponised in sanctions which makes all the countries with questionable democracies scared to trust the USD if it can so easily be used against them.

The chipmaker warned that it would miss Wall Street estimates and that growth had slowed significantly because of disappointing gaming sales driven by macroeconomic conditions. It also warned its gross margin would drop.\n\nNvidia missed on revenue but Refinitiv estimates didnt change after the company warned on guidance and said it expected to report $6.7 billion in the quarter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 15:56:02'] Listen to what you just said, you can‚Äôt buy their products. Their supply chain is crippled, they will look like GM after earnings. Lower sales, higher margins, expecting to fix things 2nd Half of 2022. Stock won‚Äôt do much.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 16:47:12'] amzn may have done well because rivian shares or they are increasing the price of prime. They are squeezing more out of their customers esp prime. NVDA will go up because of they are more of a software company then a hardware company and sorted their supply chain problems on the hardware they do sell. LOGI had a win so gaming hardware should be ok. CRSR to confirm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 17:48:43'] Great recap!Forward P/E with the current downside risk isn't a good indicator imo. Equities are expensive but the concentration into certain stocks is probably where the risk is and why markets might fall in the near-term.Positioning probably doesn't let the market fall too much without a credit event, so I agree earning theta is the way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 09:05:24'] Chegg offers high quality courses while chatgpt offers high dubious answers, you cannot compare them. Chatgpt is a good addition but it does alot of mistakes all while pretending to be 100% correct. I actually sold my shares at $28 in december though. Chegg just never managed or even tried to enter the European education market, unlike Apple of Microsoft did, especially during COVID.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 12:43:32'] Ok this is just personal experience, but ChatGPT did one of my Econ assignments in 3 minutes while it would have taken me at least a half hour on my own.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 18:51:29'] On the contrary, Chegg actually provides right answers while Chat GPT will confidently give you the wrong answer, and then when you confront it about it's mistake, it'll just apologize and say you're right.  ChatGPT is particularly bad at calculating statistics.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 18:58:29'] What will be the difference for the end consumer? Chegg is $20/m, what will the subscription version of ChatGPT be? All ChatGPT will do is eliminate competition and draw all customers to itself before upping the price. Fair enough, the service will be better for somethings, but Chegg does what Chegg does because it isn't that hard. If ChatGPT pushes them out, then Chegg's customers will just have to pay more to cover other expenses of a service that does what Chegg does at the same level as they do now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 23:13:43'] OP, it's pretty sad that you and others like you are spending your parents' money to sit in a class and browse the Internet looking for ways to ***ensure*** that your diploma is ***truly worthless***.  Not just to you (because you learned nothing) but to hiring managers (when they realize how little you and your classmates have learned).  Relying on outsourcing and chatbots to make a passing grade is like advertising your own worthlessness as an employee.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 01:50:43'] A Language Model does not, in itself, have Intelligence. Much like the humans of reddit, just because you can speak proper english doesn't stop you from YOLOing your house on 24 hour to expiration OTM options on earnings.My Hot Take is that ChatGPT can be just as much of a degenerate as anyone on this subreddit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 02:29:21'] ChatGPT skims the internet to be relevant. Best way to combat free information? Paywall and license everything. If ChatGPT somehow accesses and releases information that should be licensed or locked behind a paywall. Sue Microsoft, why? Because they‚Äôll be supporting piracy or stealing IP from others.I don‚Äôt think Chegg is going away, yet. Especially how knowledge is literally locked behind paywalls even now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 07:56:37'] No it won't. Sure GPT it works with some stuff but doesn't work well for other subjects. I will still use chegg
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 09:10:00'] As a stem major, i use it mostly for OChem so subjects that require chemistry may still keep Chegg alive

This is CGPT 4.0, they‚Äôve seen this coming and have larger servers and more money to scale this technology.I think this success will be short lived once they iron out the functionality and ethics of this product. In fact MSFT is on the cutting edge of software. They have this product ready to launch but probably don‚Äôt want to be the face of global academic cheating. Idk maybe ride the short wave but reserve large long scale investments into any 1 AI company right now.The mega caps are giving up this market share you can believe that.
POST: ['2021-11-11 10:00:12'] POST TITLE: b'Just put nearly all of my savings in Microsoft, Meta and NVIDIA'
POST_TEXT: b"So, I've been investing in rather unknown-shadowy stocks for a while without really knowing what I do. I just tried different things and mainly bought what some guy on YouTube viewed as promising. They mostly turned out quite instable, however I was still able to make some profit out of them.\n\nToday, I decided to finally sell all of them, take my profit and equally YOLO it along with 4/5 of my savings. I randomly selected these three tech giants: Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta. One, because I know a lot about them and two, because I personally cannot see them significantly drop in value in the long term. \n\nSo, what do you think? Can I expect some profit or am I a complete retard? Thanks for the outlook!"

If I have a big win I take most of that and put it into long positions on companies with long runways, large moats, pricing power. I like founder run businesses and rollup strategy companies. Personally, my longs are unity software, intuitive surgical, Accenture, Microsoft, constellation software, Brookfield asset managers, Amarican tower, equitable Bank and Lululemon. I have some smaller positions  in other names as well. It helps that it is all sheltered in a tfsa so I don't have to pay taxes on my gains. It has proven to be very affective.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 18:00:17'] Something about you telling me nvidia is free money while holding a 18k loss don‚Äôt sit right with me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:53:03'] Nope. Nvidia will kill earnings and have great guidance, but is going to drop 20%. PTON will hit $100 after they announce their products have killed several more children and that will be forced to layoff 50% of employees
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:24:39'] This is the shitty DD I come here for
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:25:12'] You seem real confident for a dude who's down 18k on his Nvidia position.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:53:05'] Did someone say free money?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:17:50'] Nvidia will definitely beat earnings
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 15:06:37'] worth more than FB now! üòé
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:20:41'] Are you concerned at all about AMD now also having RTX (ray tracing) available, taking NVDA‚Äôs advantage away in that regard? I only ask because a good majority of my friends built their own PC‚Äôs, and their perspective on it was that AMD is the way to go, especially now that they‚Äôve got RTX capability in their products as well. Not trying to dismiss your DD, just genuinely curious about your perspective on this, as a heavy NVDA hodler. ‚úåÔ∏è

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 15:11:38'] I was surprised NVDA had a crazy jump in the green today. I thought NVDA was going to keep falling down today after the failed ARM deal. As long as people don‚Äôt get scared of hearing words like inflation or interest rates, we might see NVDA climb back up this week
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:56:09'] Nevermind that ARM based chips are taking over at Tim Apple, AWS is moving a ton of its internal workload into ARM, has public EC2 and lambda tuning ARM, google and Microsoft are chasing as well as open compute project. Would have been a good addition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 14:57:24'] Yea it was priced in

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 06:41:47'] >The data shows that insider buying has decreased significantly from the prior week, while insider selling has increased. This could be a sign that insiders are losing confidence in the market and are beginning to sell their shares.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:12:22'] So what is my best investment strategy after seeing this?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:58:10'] The top 20 stocks make up only 29.17% of the weight of the S&P 500, however they contributed to 7.08% of the index's total return. This means that although a small minority, these companies had a large impact on the overall performance of the stock market this year.
