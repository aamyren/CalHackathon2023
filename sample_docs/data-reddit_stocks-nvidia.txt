POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html\n\nNvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidias shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmakers stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidias gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.\n\nSignificantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. Its been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:28:11'] I sold my 3 whole shares Friday and caused this continued run
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:25:28'] Nvidia at $415 even using the most optimistic revenue growth forecast (JP Morgan's) is trading higher P/Revenue than Microsoft at Dotcom peak in February 2020.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:50:09'] Still can‚Äôt believe I sold for $240 hahaha
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:05:44'] Just sold some nvdia shares for the first time, couldn't resist making a 211% profit and feeling that I had to balance my portfolio. It was only 16 shares, but happy with this decision :)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:39:42'] Had 5 shares, I sold them making 1.3k plus my original investment. I'm pretty happy since it's my biggest gain since investing. Looking to invest that is something more safe if anyone has any recommendations
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:32:33'] I'm a long time gamer and also one who witnessed the birth of RIVA TNT. I must admit until the last 3 to 4 years ago I still thought that Nvidia products are mostly for only graphics processing - until the crypto craze that has opened my eyes that GPU has more uses than for gaming. And now AI seems to be another interesting use for GPU.This makes me feel curious in two points: 1. aside from crypto and AI, in future would GPU's be also useful in other applications outside of literal 'graphics processing'? Because if so, then once the AI craze calms down, perhaps the value of GPU makers would still shine again in future uses.2. Would it be possible in future that GPU would somehow have their names changed, since their use would reach far other than graphics processing? Or they would retain its legacy name, just like 'hard disks' are still names used for hard drives in general, even though SSD has no disks anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:39:58'] At this point, what is the runway for NVDA? If you have an investment in it, I don‚Äôt think 2-5 trillion dollar market cap for this company is realistic. And I do believe this valuation is astronomically high. Potential investors should search elsewhere for opportunities.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:49:20'] Still not selling. Not selling when Nvidia's overvalued ass drops to fair. Not selling as it rises during the next time someone hypes AI. I will sell it after AI is realized or when someone can make chips better then them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:05:27'] Only thing I don‚Äôt understand is how the majority all agree that it‚Äôs overvalued, yet it‚Äôs still going up..? At least with TSLA the majority loved the stock so it pushed through the 1t mc. Seems odd to me that there‚Äôs only a few people in each thread that think the valuation makes senseEdit: by majority, I mean Reddit. Not the majority of retail.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:28:42'] With Microsoft pumping money into AMD to build a competitive GPU how will that do you think affect AMD and NVIDIA price‚Äôs going forward?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:28:53'] Hi Reddit! I own SOXX - an ETF that tracks the entire semiconductor sector. 10% of it's holdings are NVIDIA and it's close to an all time high. I own SOXX as part of my ROTH IRA as I believe it's a good long term investment, but I'm wondering if it's wise to sell some of it or all of it off while NVIDIA is on this huge streak. I can always re-enter a new position at another time. For reference my average cost on SOXX is like $408 and it's currently trading at $498

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:27:05'] So they had better results from 7.15 billion to 11 billion in sales. Should their stock really have jumped in this high?I feel like people are just riding on this train wild.It‚Äôs like when you would see BTC jump like crazy and it was wild to consider buying.Hell no I wouldn‚Äôt buy BTC as no 50K, 60K etc

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:53:57'] This is the part I don't understand.  AI is really hot right now however the top 3 supercomputers are not using Nvidia (Frontier uses AMD CPU and AMD GPU,  Fugaky uses ARM CPU, Lumi uses AMD CPU and AMD GPU).  The fourth, fifth, and sixth fastest supercomputers use Nvidia GPU (14,000 A100 GPU for Leonardo, Lumit 28,000 V100, Sierra 17,000 V100)From that data,  I took it as the newest supercomputers are actually moving away from Nvidia (the newest and top 3).  The 4,5,6 computers were built just around the COVID time frame).
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 07:46:11'] So‚Ä¶ do I sell? Should I start selling?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:28:54'] I have 400 shares at a really good price. I will probably sell because I agree it will likely pop and go down, but I do love the company so would probably buy back in when that happens. The question now is do I sell right now or hold a little longer.......

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:36:34'] Hello, banana bunch! Let's swing through this exciting news using Monkey Banana Language.    Nvidia has become a huge banana tree in the jungle (reached a $1 trillion market cap), joining an exclusive club of only a few other giant trees, mostly in the tech forest.    Why has Nvidia grown so much? They've been growing a ton of shiny, attractive bananas (producing high-demand GPUs) that are important for both gaming and artificial intelligence platforms. As more monkeys (consumers) see the value of these bananas, they've been clamoring to get them.    Plus, Nvidia's latest batch of bananas (earnings report) was even bigger and better than what most monkeys expected, which has made this tree even more attractive. Nvidia also predicted it'll grow even more bananas ($11 billion in sales) in the future.    As a result, many other banana trees in the chipmaking part of the jungle have also grown bigger. However, not all trees have been so fortunate. Intel, for instance, has been facing some challenges and hasn't grown as much as others.    Want to understand more about these giant trees and the bananas they grow?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:32:22'] I‚Äôm brand new to investing and I happened to get a single NVDA share at about $265 a few weeks ago. Any thoughts on what I should do? Wish I‚Äôd bought two so i could sell one and hold one. But alas I‚Äôve only got one and idk whether to hold or sell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:41:29'] I had 75 shares bought at $263 and sold today at market open at $405. I am a big believer in the company but $1 trillion market cap is correction territory. I hope to get back in. My gains on Nvidia are paltry compared to my wider losses in my portfolio - I have a long way to go before I can get back into positive territory. =(

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:24:15'] More than a third of AAPL market cap on about a ninth the revenue (and that's the Q2 guidance, not Q1 actual). Tripled in price in five months *before* the blowout guidance. Pulled AMD up 50% in a month along with it. Clearly this is reasonable price action, and there's no AI hype bubble.(PS: "If you say this ridiculous price action is a hype bubble, you're saying that AI itself is mere hype with no more actual potential than NFTs" is just a stunningly stupid take, and I have to wonder how many of the people saying it actually believe it)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:35:14'] Portfolio is heavy on semi stocks, via ETFs and individual small buys. (Nvidia now way overweight in those ETFs )Nvidia is the lighthouse, but these developments are very bullish for the whole industry, and this is just one hype train in the semi sector pipeline.Semi sector is very demanding on R&D, so less likely of a small time player pulling off an upset, unlike software based tech, so very confident long term in this.I imagine nvidia will pull back pretty hard when the hype settles, but it‚Äôs nice to see the excitement around it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 22:20:20'] Ok so Nvidia may have revenue of 35 to 40 billion in 2023. How does that put a 1 Trillion valuation on a stock? People are paying for the next 20 years of earnings at todays prices. It‚Äôs absurd. But yes, the market can stay irrational for a few months, but reversion to the mean always comes into play. $200 seems like a good entry point. This does feel like a CNBC coordinated pump and dump.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 22:35:07'] NVDA has a revenue of 27 billion, a modest profit of 4 billion, and a market capitalization of 1 trillion. If we were to multiply the revenue by three, the resulting sum would be 81 billion, albeit with a considerable decrease of 91%. If we were to multiply the revenue by four, the resulting sum would be 108 billion, albeit with a decline of 89%. If we were to multiply the revenue by five, the resulting sum would be 135 billion, albeit with a decrease of 86%. If we were to multiply the revenue by six, the resulting sum would be 162 billion, albeit with a decrease of 83%.**I speculate that NVDA will reach a peak of approximately 430.**

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 19:05:17'] NVDA is definitely way way way overvalued. It will see larger sales for some time due to the increased demand. But long term their products won't be as needed and there will be competition.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:41:35'] Once people realize that they only need cuda for training the AI (and competition will rise here easier than in the gpu-market), the nvidia-bubble will burst; don't think that AI itself will; AI will stay; because everything is successful as long as you can make or deliver p\*\*n out of it.But back to NVDA; their success are hardware-sales, but they aren't apple; They deliver server infrastructure, but once the market is satiated and competitors comes in, they will have made a lot of money, but the shares as they are now will not hold; they would need 3 TSMCs alone for these numbers.And AI hardware is by far not as complex as gpus, competitors will rise.

While crypto was less realistic and AI is more realistic, the issue here is that Nvidia has done anything or it‚Äôs revenue doesn‚Äôt match its during valuation. This is people buying in on the hype thinking this stock will make them rich by tomorrow. At $400 it‚Äôs vastly overpriced given nvidia‚Äôs current revenue.

They are reporting they expect over 60% revenue growth in Q2. That being said, the price of this is crazy, it has easily beat ATH. The stock has more than doubled YTD and more than tripled from its lows less than a year ago. It‚Äôs price is already above analyst price targets of $300, although I expect revisions given this earnings news.

Nvidia is literally more expensive from a PS ratio standpoint. Meanwhile Cisco still hasn‚Äôt recovered from its 2000 high. You‚Äôll probably make good money shorting this company, going off of how the dot com bubble played out

I know AI AI AI Ai.... but be specific? Who is footing a data center expansion this large... or is this direct to consumer sales and there is a return to the local server for this?- These are on existing products / chip sets and no RD costs or moves/cost in production shift to move to AI or its specialty chip-sets?I find the turnaround interesting to say the least.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 15:00:38'] The momentum is insane. I'm up like 550% on my 152 shares that I've been stubbornly holding for years. I did NOT expect a recovery this soon. I stupidly took out a relatively small short to hedge a couple months ago and have been trimming it as the stock's gone up. I'm about to buy to cover the last 5 shares of my short but now my question is what the heck do I do with my long position. I like the company a lot and I thought I was committed to holding through the noise no matter what happens but this is a bit of a curveball. I wasn't expecting a new ATH this soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 09:13:54'] A lot of the reasons why I bought and held onto Nvidia the past 7 years are the same reasons people are saying today. I wish I had bought it sooner.It is not a secret. This is not some type of secret investment where only insiders know something.This is why you hold onto great companies for the long term. The playbook for investing is simple, obviously difficult to execute, but the actual rules of Buffett-style investing are not complicated.If you want to reap the exponential growth from Nvidia into your portfolio, you buy and hold. Trading in and out of Nvidia and certainly shorting it is a dangerous game with a capped upside.

Now it's trading at 53 PE.Is 53 PE fair for a company growing as fast as NVDA? Yes.Intel guided to -$2.6bn loss

Any board member would be included in this, as well as the CEO and VPs, top executives, etc. So this is a non-story. He had good timing to be sure, but this isn't noteworthy at all.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:12:48'] Has she even tried UIPaths AI? It‚Äôs a god damn macro company that tried to remake itself as an analytics company and is pretending it‚Äôs  an AI company.  I run a data  science group and  We went with a combo of H2O and Snowflake which has worked extremely well.  And we ended up getting rid of UIPath cause the scraping was ok but the costs kept going upThis is the problem with financial analysts choosing companies that they don‚Äôt know the actual products of.

POST: ['2023-05-31 03:22:50'] POST TITLE: b"Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally"
POST_TEXT: b"Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).\r  \n\r  \nThe founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.\r  \n\r\n\nNvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  \nIt hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading s"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:25:09'] Sounds salty. Watch it go even higher now
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:54:00'] I mean..... it clearly is
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:28:44'] I‚Äôm not saying NVDA is not overpriced. It certainly appears to be. But so is the entire ARK portfolio. Also Tesla aims for $8-10 TRILLION in revenue by 2030‚Ä¶ so Tesla is going to 100x their revenue in 7 years. This woman must be high off her ass or something
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:38:25'] What exactly has Cathie Wood accomplished?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:36:23'] Everyone and their grandma was talking about how overpriced NVDA was, and after the rally everyone's shitting on Cathie in particular like they weren't parroting the same shit for months
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:51:18'] Cathie thought it was overpriced at a much lower price as well. She may very well be right this time. But she's not somebody you should listen to.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:11:52'] Couldn‚Äôt she just pull up a spreadsheet. Make up some bullshit numbers. Plug in 50% growth for 10 years and set a price target of 2000 after buying it and call it a day? That‚Äôs how she hit with Tesla, her single successful stock.Valuation only matters to sane people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:34:02'] The time to sell is probably when she buys in
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:14:03'] NVDA may very well be overpriced. But we won't know for sure until we look back a few years from now.If you watch her CNBC interview, one of the reasons she gave was Tesla Dojo. LMAO. Her ‚Äúresearch‚Äù has little depth and is often misguided. I watch entertainers like Cathie Wood for fun. To understand AI market I follow real experts like Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI), who said and I quote ‚Äúit turned out that they make a lot more GPUs than TPUs [or specialized chips] so it's cheaper to train on GPUs.‚Äù Google has thousands of engineers working on software and hardware around their TPU. If anyone is going to take market share from Nvidia, it will be Google, not Tesla. Cathie is full of shit and talking her own book.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:02:29'] She calls out NVDA for being overpriced, which it probably is, but doesn‚Äôt call TSLA overpriced, which it clearly is. This just comes off as sour grapes and trying not to look like a clown for selling too early.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:36:52'] I thought valuations didn't matter for companies changing the world and innovation. Weird!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:36'] She isn't wrong about it being over priced, doesn't mean demand won't keep it overpriced.  Didn't she sell her shares 3 months ago?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:13:39'] She not wrong, but that doesnt mean it wont still go higher to insane levels. Just like her favorite tesla. So in that sense, she kinda is wrongüòÖ
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 16:34:54'] Why is her opinion even discussed given how badly her fund has performed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:54:07'] >Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after looking at the stock price.FTFY
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:33:41'] Counter take: This is the one time she did good by her investors by reducing risk before an earnings. Sure it turned out to be wrong, but removing risk is never something that should be scoffed at or followed up with FOMO. Stocks at highs tend to be at most risk for correction if earnings do anything less than exceed. This is contrary to every other call she has made of keeping a high risk-on portfolio during high interest rate enviroment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:58'] Besides her missed bet she may be right with that one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:10'] First time she makes sense and being responsible with her clients money. Its okay to miss a rally. There will be 1000s of opportunities if AI is really the next revolution
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:57'] I'd short Nvidia but Cathie has not been right in years so I'll just stay out of this...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:36:57'] Not sure if people are just here to shit on Cathie, or if there's people out there that doesn't think this is a sky high price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:11:09'] "Woman who didn't get an invite says she didn't want to go anyway." &#x200B;Sounds like she missed out and is now trying to justify why she missed the boat and saying it wasn't her fault.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:04:25'] Cope
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:13:28'] Sounds like sour grapes to me.  She‚Äôs angling to bring the price down and then swoop in to take advantage.  Happens a lot
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:20:40'] I saw a stat on here the other day that really distills how insane it has gotten: after NVDA's earnings were released, their valuation jumped by basically the same amount as AMD's entire market cap... Of fucking course it's overbought!! Read that again people!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:17:01'] just an obvious attempt at restoring her credibility
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:30:19'] She is not wrong here with the word overpriced but that did not stop Tesla when that stock was overpriced. It still went up until it crashed like bitcoin etc. The power is in the memo or fomo investors. When they all get bored. It's short short short.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:57:35'] Sure. And what's her new Tesla target? is it 2000 unicorns ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:10:36'] She sounds like a redditor lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:22:16']   She would.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:04:40'] Sellers remorse.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:05:28'] she gets mocked and people will disregard that she said this, but she's right.look at how nvidia stacks up against the other trillion dollar companies in terms of revenues or earnings multiples.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:07:46'] Still a holding in the Ark Venture Fund for now

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:16:42'] I think post covid we see through the bullshit and how over hyped she was. She has no credibility, got lucky with tsla. Alot of her other picks have tanked tremendously.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:23:12'] Her entire fund and career was getting lucky on Tesla. Everything else has been wrong
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:27:08'] So did I, Im just salty tho.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:34:53'] She doesnt understand that soon there will be no more need for software because it will be learned. Nvidia is definitely overvalued (soon their competition will diminish them) but the future is in hardware. Software unlimited, and it's free now, hardware is expensive, because it s physical
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 07:37:01'] Good old Cathie, She missed the boat. Of course it is over priced for  her. She is trying to bring it down with this statement so she can buy and then say how under valued it is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:05:22'] Not even the great Ark Invest research team could predict that Nvidia would guide $4 Billion higher in sales q2.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:05:45'] All she does is buy overpriced growth stocks that have never proven to be a good investment strategy lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:06:48'] Sold at 415. Missed the high point the last time it spiked and don't want to miss out again. Good luck to those invested still
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 08:08:43'] Are other fund managers similarly impulsive like this? or is cathie in the minority?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 09:06:49'] She‚Äôs got no conviction and is letting the rate hikes force her out of positions. She wouldn‚Äôt catch as much flack if she would simply hold her ground and only adjust holdings when the thesis changes.Her overall mantra is disruptive innovation. That shit is not going to happen in a matter of months. I can‚Äôt count how many times she‚Äôs been in and out of tech stocks like Palantir for example. Buy high, sell low is for a amateurs. Not worth the expense fee she‚Äôs charging.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 09:06:59'] She‚Äôs been wrong for a while and got lucky during COVID boom.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 09:12:29'] Same goes with the Know-it-all Trolls in Yahoo comments section. I agree that these AI stocks will go down eventually to their actual real value. Nevertheless, anyone who is talking trash on the current rally are just mad they sold or didn't buy in.

She was smart to sell; but sometimes doing the right/smart thing is the wrong thing to do and the win is following the herd and doing the wrong/dumb thing... just so long as you get out before everyone realizes how dumb and wrong it is. I think nvidia's CEO is going to be in jail when they don't come close to their new projections and someone whistleblows that it was all a big ass lie.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 18:24:42'] She made a lot on NVDA and she's still making as some of her funds still hold it. You sell on the way up, not on the way down. The fact she sold early doesn't mean she lost money, she just didn't make more than she could have and that's just hindsight.

POST_TEXT: b'Before I knew about this psychological bias, I (and many others I know) thought we just had trouble \'biting the bullet\' and investing in solid ideas. Thoughts like "it was in front of me all along, but for some reason, I was too scared to put money into it" were common. But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of \'ideas\' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past. So why do people feel this way, that they keep \'missing\' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias. \n\nHindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), "a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 16:33:00'] Great investing opportunities are by definition never obvious. If they were obvious then everyone would already be invested and there would be little upside. You have to go against the grain of consensus, take a risk, AND be right in your prediction of the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 18:22:08'] I think one of the prime directives of investing is to accurately figure out your risk tolerance. When I miss out I ask myself a few questions: why did I miss that one or not pull the trigger if I saw it? If I was just asleep at the wheel then I‚Äôll take the L. But if I was abiding by some personal investing principle (ex: ‚Äúwhy did I miss that run up?? Oh yeah, cuz they were already trading at a   50x multiple!‚Äù), then I tell myself for every great swing I didn‚Äôt take, I probably saved myself from several big fails. It‚Äôs easy to see the FOMO the opportunities we missed, but people rarely track the times the didn‚Äôt pull the trigger and are the better for it. Rule #1 don‚Äôt lose money‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 17:52:39'] I look at my META position that I recently bought in below $90 and feel a little better.  In all honesty, it‚Äôs not worth punishing yourself for it. I bet many Nvidia holders are torn in a different way. They‚Äôre sitting on gains, wondering if they should hold or sell. Fear of selling something that keeps mooning and fear of holding through a ‚Äúcrash‚Äù while missing profits isn‚Äôt a fun situation.Psychological battles go both ways.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 17:17:05'] Next time tech gets slaughtered, consider DCAing into the dip. Tech is here to stay, but itll remain a "risk on" investment for maybe another 30-50 years

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 16:38:50'] I also like to look at missed disasters. Like when I liked regional banks and *almost* bought some but wanted to try scalping a pot stock more. Well I got some grey hairs off my pot stock play but ended up with a 7% gain. While the regional banks I liked lost 30%.I also liked IONQ and missed out there. But it balances out if you remember the good and the bad both.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:19:41'] Ehh. I never had a plan to touch NVDA, just like TSLA. I want to hold for decades with confidence. I have exposure to other chips sector stocks, so I‚Äôm still winning anyways. It‚Äôs not hard to see that chips will be necessary for our future. I‚Äôm just exposing myself to much more entrenched players who are the picks and shovels for these designers. Moat and barrier to entry is way better there for my 30y investing future. I don‚Äôt need to make a quick buck to be a millionaire.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 18:18:12'] I‚Äôm not sorry that I missed Nvidia. I don‚Äôt understand it. I think it‚Äôs at irrational valuation right now. In light of that, buying, for me, would be like gambling.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:14:43'] Not anymore, but I agree with the title. But I will give my advice if anyone feels victim of hindsight biasI‚Äôve been following stocks for three years now. I started when I was 18, in 2020, I am 21 now. During those first couple of years, market went wild. I missed seemingly every opportunity.But one thing I realized. The opportunities kept coming, and will keep coming. First next gen tech, then EV, then crypto, then rotation out of tech, now back to tech, and AI. There is no shortage of opportunities in this world. If you keep your eyes open for the next opportunity, instead of reflecting on the past and what you missed, you will find it. This is a mistake people often make. They chase after trains that have already departed not seeing the new one arrive at the station. Artificial Intelligence is just getting started. I always was bummed I wasn‚Äôt alive or old enough during the early days of the internet, because that seemed like a generational wealth creation opportunity I missed. And then came ChatGPT. I now know a second wealth creation opportunity has arrived. I believe the best companies in the AI space have yet to even form! People forget Amazon IPO‚Äôd late into the tech bubble, 1997 I believe. Maybe the next great AI company is still under construction. But keep your eyes out instead of reflecting on the past. One final word about Nvidia- nothing intrisntic about the business changed, the arrival of ChatGPT changed the company‚Äôs outlook. It was getting (unfairly) beat down in 2022 , no one saw ChatGPT coming unless you worked in the space. Good luck investing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:30:31'] I sold 40 shares of it in 2014 because it barely moved in 5 years. Made a $40 profit. That would be 160 shares now at around $3-4 cost basis. I can't beat myself up about it because I literally bought it in 2009 thinking "Hey, that's the company that made my graphics card, cool".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 03:11:06'] Thing is it works both ways. There were people later last year who were laughing at those holding NVDA because according to them at $300 it was obviously overvalued and in a bubble and would continue to fall in value.I think that's the interesting thing about investing ‚Äì¬†people who have been long NVDA over the last few years have been both extremely wrong and extremely right. The consensus "rightness" or "wrongness" of their thinking depends mostly on market volatility at the given time period than anything fundamental.In 6 months it's just as likely there will be threads here asking if people are beating themselves up for believing in the AI hype. It's really only over very long time periods you can say with any confidence if an investment was right or wrong. Well, unless you've somehow been successfully trading these swings ‚Äì those are the real winners here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:11:34'] Zoom out, NVDA was at 340 level back in 2021 & then at 100 in 2022. What goes up & down that easy is not an investment, it's speculative gambling. NVDA is a mega cap penny stock these days & it's probably not going to end well for those FOMOing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 19:42:37'] NVDA was never obvious. It‚Äôs been overpriced for five years. I say this as someone who blindly dumped half my cash into two years ago and made out very well. It was dumb luck, buy and pray.META earlier this year was obvious, and I didn‚Äôt get in, and THAT I regret.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 17:28:24'] No I don‚Äôt beat myself up. Because when I look back I know that I could‚Äôve just as easily lost everything so it‚Äôs useless to look back and beat yourself up for what you could have done. Also if I don‚Äôt understand the company I don‚Äôt invest even if I lose out on the biggest investment opportunity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 18:43:18'] Nvidia and AI is obvious, but I thought the slow down of crypto mining and the end of ETH mining was going to keep Nvidia down for awhile. I still believe it might be a temporary pop, I dont quite believe they are valued correctly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 20:10:10'] Tech will continue to outperform all other sectors.I've heard people call tech a bubble in the entirety of the past decade and more. (You have encountered them).The people who always try to convince you that the fall of tech is just around the corner, that perhaps another - unknown stock - will lead the next decade. (You have encountered them).These people are the same people who hate on people who buy Nvidia 4090 GPUs. They know what's the best of class product or stock, but don't want other people to enjoy the gains if they don't have it (crabs in a bucket).Beware these people, as they can sound convincing and once you accept their (tech bubble) ideas, you may also become one of these people after you miss out on gains.It's better to **keep it simple.** Tech revenue is growing at high double digits, that means their outperformance is still intact as no other sector is growing so. Debating over whether the stock should be 25 or 35 PE is meaningless, because double digit growth changes PE ratios quickly.For example, MSFT's EPS is 2.5x higher than it was just 4 years ago. It might be hard to appreciate 20% in one year, but it adds up. That means 35 PE becomes 14 PE in just 4 years.If you buy tech at a local peak and it goes down, like it did in 2020 and 2022, you're supposed to average down. MSFT Azure was growing at 46% this time last year despite the falling share price. They are opportunities and not "aha tech bubble" moments.

Yes, it's exciting and it's what people are talking about right now, but I feel the industry is too optimistic and I personally feel like we're walking on eggshell right now.

I sell bull put spreads or bear call spreads to take a modest amount of money at high probability.Playing options into earnings just doesn't fit with how I want to trade.I know a few people that turned a few hundred bucks into like 10K plus. Pretty nutty, and I wish I'd been in it, but thats how it goes. For every play like that theres many more where you have the options, earnings come out, they're normal, IV crush slams your position and you lose most of your premium.

In reality, they're exceptionally lucky, if they're telling the truth at all. Nvidia's fundamentals right now are insane. No *rational* person would hold their stock at these levels. Anyone who is is taking enormous risk. High calculated risk isn't the devil, but it should be acknowledged for what it is. Does this mean Nvidia can't keep going up? Of course not. It might. The market is often irrational. You might win the lottery tomorrow if you buy a ticket. That doesn't mean it's a good investment. At this point it's gambling.

I think most people who have gotten into AI have realized eventually we would reach a threshold where the tech would very quickly begin to yield extreme gains in productivity and companies like nvidia would be the first to reap those rewards in a big way but it just wasn‚Äôt obvious when that would happen.

I also bought the same ETF with covered calls yielding 14% as a back up. While they stay flat I still rake in 14%, if it goes down even more, if it goes up both ETF will gain value.

I thought ChatGBT was cool when it first got popular couple months back. After a week or two, the interest fell flat for me. Therefore, I had a pessimistic, skeptical POV on the AI buzz (at least in the stock market, retaining to specific equities).I'm actually reluctant to not get too hurt on AI stocks. Since I had my view as I did, I was generally short these type of stocks. So for me, I never had FOMO or beaten myself about NVDA, META, or AI penny stocks runups.

Missing out doesnt bother me as much though cause I know nothing about the automotive or battery industry, so I shouldn't have gotten involved.The WHY of missing out bothers me as much as the amount
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 01:09:27'] I kick myself for missing some short swing trades, in particular shortly after HKD's IPO when it briefly ran from around $25 to over $2000, the came back down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 01:19:03'] I wanted to invest in chips in 2016: Intel and Nvidia both around $40 - I chose Intel As they had bigger profits and weren‚Äôt as overvalued in my opinion.I thought AMD might go bankrupt at $1.I sold my Occidental Pretroleum shares with 30-70% - and missed the best performing stock of 2022.It is normal to have some good and bad picks, it could always take another was.For example I got into Apple just before Warren Buffet, position was never in the reds and I am 700% up or so
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 01:38:54'] No, I keep a daily journal attached to my trading logs.  So I my notes on my thoughts during trades, certain news events I'm taking note of, etc.That way I save myself from hindsight bias, it also has made me more  detailed in my note taking.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 04:10:48'] Make a journal of why didn‚Äôt you invest into something at that point in time. It will help you clarify things.You didn‚Äôt invest in nvidia because you thought it was already overpriced because of X and Y. Now you go back and analyze it again. Your principles were right and the numbers proper? Then you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Only if you made some analysis error that is something you may fix in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 04:56:00'] I bought NVDA in 2016 and I sold last September at $124, pretty much at the bottom. I used those profits to fund my kids' 529s thinking that was the smart thing to do...
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 05:08:34'] I dont invest in single stocks anymore, only ETFs, but when I see moments like with Nvidia, it makes me think whether or not I would have been smart enough to get in before the price jumped. Most of the time, I wouldn't, but I do feel slightly envious and kicking myself.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 05:08:56'] When the bitcoin white papers came out I remember telling a friend that I wanted to learn all about it and acquire some coins.  We were both broke at the time but it was so interesting to me I wanted to learn how to get as much of it as possible. My friend laughed at me and called it Chuck E. Cheese money. I stopped following it because of their comment. Years later, I met a person who invested in bitcoin in 2016. We had a long conversation about crypto and how much money he made from it. I wanted to cry lol. Now look at the numbers. Oddly enough years later at the peak, the same person who called it ‚Äúchuck e cheese money‚Äù called me to tell me about investing in crypto.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 05:40:16'] This should be obvious, but it is easy to succumb to the folly when you're new. Hindsight is 20/20.Why didn't I invest in Apple in the 80s? Why didn't I buy gold in the 70s? Why didn't I get into bitcoin in the 2010s? Why didn't I play the winning lottery numbers last night?All in all, having that mindset will do NOTHING but hurt you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 05:59:57'] I chalk it up to being poor.  I have both AMD and NVIDIA in my portfolio, but I don't make enough money that I can take big risks on individual stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 07:36:32'] Absolutely.  Everything is obvious in hindsight, but in the moment there is always very legitimate counter points.  i.e., a year from now, will NVDA be $800 or $200?  Either one may happen and if it does, it will be make perfect sense.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 07:44:59'] I beat myself up once over Zoom. I was in school and seeing everyone switch over to Zoom for classes and such. I knew it was public too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 07:47:30'] It seems "trading" is usually why I've been disappointed or missed an opportunity. Holding onto stocks that I believe in has served me better than "trading".

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 08:01:51'] Had a few hundred shares of a minerals company last year at like $7, sold because I needed the money for something else, then 2 weeks later it gets bought out by another company at around $27 per share.  That still stings, but it's a good lesson.

I was very fortunate and mostly lucky to have held over the years. I more than doubled my position after the 50% crash caused by the bitcoin bubble pop of 2018. But you're right, its tough and you usually have to have the foresight AND the resolve to stomach the volatility over the years.

I had  bought NVDA back in 2017 or so and sold it on Dec 24th's 2018 5  five  minute bear market for tax loss harvesting and my plan was to buy it back after the  30 day wash sale rule. I think   It would have been a six bagger for me if I held on. Boo hoo hoo. Instead I used those proceeds to add to my  AAPL position at the time and so that addition became a five bagger instead. I deployed all my dry powder on that one day so didn't have any after 30 days as I needed cash to pay property taxes too. So no tears lost on this one that got away.

All these companies do have cool internal AI programs that we will never see.I know Nvidia programmers run code through their bot to tinker with things. But they also rename or slightly modify before putting it in. Probably afraid of their own AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 00:12:22'] Nvidia was way overvalued even before all this AI nonsense, I don't regret buying then because I don't believe it was the right decision. It's easy to look back in hindsight.The things I beat myself up about are the ones where I thought about diving in but decided against it for one reason or another (usually just lack of funds).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 04:05:34'] I tried being savvy as well when I bought Abbvie at $42 and sold at $52. I've had several tickers that doubled, tripled, and more so it doesn't bother me as much. You've had several opportunities to try a run at it again with those tickers since.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 04:56:43'] Honestly, while I understand the feeling of "missing out", you acted rationally and took a profit. If you do that often enough, you'll have no reason to be sorry about anything.Who was it that said his success in investing was due to "always selling too early"?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 05:37:37'] There were A LOT of opportunities to get into TSLA between 2017 and now.You must be kidding right?You could have bought at $100 when TSLA was way oversold back in Jan. If TSLA drops a lot due to negative news next time, I'm definitely putting in way more funds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 04:11:07'] Shit happens and it‚Äôs a good lesson for everyone in their own trading. No one gets it right but it‚Äôs helpful to examine our strategies and reasons for buying and selling.I am kicking myself pretty hard for selling a $110 covered call on Google earlier this year when they were sitting below $100 for a stretch. I got greedy and impatient
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 05:11:54'] The only part of this I would consider really dumb is if you have had that cash on the sidelines since 2017.Yes. Many, many, many people had money in those stocks and then sold for a profit. You had a profit. Look, there were an infinite number of things any person *could have* done at points in the past that would have made you wealthy. This isn't new or special or unique.Do today.

NVDA would have been a 10+ bagger if I held on  but no regrets as the money I put into AAPL became a 7 bagger and the money I put into Google became a 3 bagger.

I know this is off topic but what made you initially invest  in these companies to begin with, was it the hype at the time or did you actually believe that these companies would succeed and make great products? I guess I have a similar story where I was gonna buy a whole Bitcoin back in June of 2020 when it was roughly 5k but backed out because I thought it was too risky lol. I also wanted to buy a thousand dollars worth of Tesla back in March 2020 when it was roughly 300 bucks a share (pre split). I decided not to invest in it because someone who I had known who had a lot of experience investing in the stock market told me not to. This was also my very first time putting any money in the stock market, and I was extremely hesitant about putting my hard earned money into something I essentially thought was a gamble.If anything this experience taught me that you just gotta follow your gut when it comes to everything in life including investing lol.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 05:28:57'] Stop thinking about it, it's not worth it. Ok, think how you could do it better the next time, but don't be sad/mad about the past, cope. Think like a poker player, the money you put in the pot is gone, only the next decision counts. Let your winners run, set a stoploss and move it with the price. Don't be greedy. It's better to have a small win, because of a triggered sl than to think about the possible winnings if you would have let them run. Ask yourself why you want to sell. Are the stocks not good anymore, because of bad fundamentals?

So maybe not a stock & shares regret but maybe you can relate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 10:49:23'] Something which may help is to understand that if you 'invest actively', regret is absolutely inevitable. Once you have an idea to do something, whether you do or don't do it, you might regret it, and there are only 2 solutions to this (1) Don't invest (2) Be completely passive (buy the index robotically every month). If you are going to be active, then this just comes with the territory. See it as a cost of doing business.

When I was in trader mode, I bought TSLA at split-adjusted $4.00 and sold for $4.60 (in 2011). It doesn't haunt me though because at the time I was a swing trader and 15% in-and-out was a win. What haunts me is like selling MSFT at $185 in early 2020 just before covid hit, thinking covid will kill the market. Which it did, but I expected the downturn to last longer than a month. That was an investment and not a trade, as I'd held those shares for 15 years since the $25-$30 range.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-ceo-intel-test-chip-results-for-next-gen-process-look-good\n\nThis is imo a very promising development. By making fabs with a heavier focus on porting third parties product over, Intel massively expands their TAM by joining TSMC and Samsung in selling shovels during the gold rush. Whether the Intel chips are on top, the AMD ones, or the Nvidia ones, you always need foundries, and Intel aims to be the third largest offered to third parties by 2025.  \n  \nIf the perf/watt and cost is right, I can see former competitors hopping over, especially with early sweetheart deals to win over some consumers from TSMC which is very overbooked.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:01:48'] Here's my *tinfoil hat* theory. It is in Nvidia's interest to give the Chinese government the impression that Intel is a viable foundry replacement for TSM. Because if the Chinese believe that: 1. TSM is the only foundry capable of producing top-of-the-line GPUs.2. NVIDIA is prohibited from selling the cutting edge GPUs to China.3. Such GPUs are capable of giving the west an advantage in not just economics, but in warfare (e.g. weather system predictions), weapons (missile design and guidance), cyber warfare, or even biological warefare.Then the conclusion is that they *MUST* attack Taiwan soon to stop the disparity. However, if China has the impression that Intel can somewhat replace TSM (not completely but even partially), then such an attack is less attractive as it would be like cutting 3 heads off a 5 head hydra.Also, I'm sure Nvidia would love for Intel to catch up. Even though Nvidia has a terrific relationship with TSM, having more foundries closer to home (and further away from Chinese missiles) is a net gain for Nvidia.

The VIX is relatively low right now given all the external market pressures that have been navigated over the past few months (rate hikes, bank failures, and now debt ceiling), so perhaps the price will stabilize and create a new support line well above 300. We should all acknowledge that this market is not making any logical sense .. just like BTC‚Äôs rise didn‚Äôt.

Now we look back on that and think it was silly  - the internet affects almost every part of our daily lives.

Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 21:33:08'] Is time to recover this gem written by Peter Lynch. &#x200B;*If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You‚Äôll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*    *A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that‚Äôs been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald‚Äôs was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald‚Äôs could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with McDonald‚Äôs. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*    *And if McDonald‚Äôs was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot‚Äôs company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*    *If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you‚Äôd just be breaking even today.*    *I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: ‚ÄúDue to the recent bankruptcy, we‚Äôre removing this stock from our buy list.‚Äù In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I‚Äôve ever seen before or since.*    *You often hear about companies whose future performance is ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù in the stock price. If that‚Äôs the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*    *When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64‚Äîthough nowhere near as extreme as EDS‚Äôs. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It‚Äôs a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon‚Äôs earnings didn‚Äôt grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18‚Öù in 1974.*    *The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*    *The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14‚Öõ in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid‚Äôs p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*    *Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn‚Äôt have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 20:49:09'] Okay but is there a catalyst? TSLA has been overvalued as hell too and if you bought puts at $300 before it fell to $100 in January you'd be a genius, but shorts have lost an insane amount of money better against it on the way up. The problem with puts is theta decay. It's not an unreasonable bet but it's time sensitive. Why is now the time?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:24:08'] While I completely agree with your thesis that NVDA is way overvalued and due for a massive pullback if not a significant drop, you're putting a trade on before it's turned and you're fighting trend. It has so much downside that it's a far far better risk-reward proposition if you wait until it confirms its price has turned downward. Nobody here should be shorting in front of a tidal wave.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 18:47:46'] I also want to clarify, that there are many other factors I‚Äôm looking at that all culminate in why I‚Äôm short $NVDA. Ranging from the recent move in bonds, to gold, to market fragility, to the overall risk-asset rally, etc. But I do not want to post a whole essay on everything, so I left the original explanation short and sweet.That being said, we are seriously one bad china news event from semis being blown up. If you have any friends or relatives in Taiwan, they can tell you how bad the situation has become over the past few years. US investors are seriously underestimating the probability of China‚Äôs interference in Taiwan. It‚Äôs not a matter of if, it‚Äôs a matter of when. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre going to have a full-on invasion, they are going to be much more surgical than that. There will be a bold move they make soon and it will be a minsky moment where US investors assign a non-zero chance that TSMC could be at risk in the future. The moment investors wake up, is the moment panic sets in.Look at what happened to $BABA and $JD when sleepy china cracked down on VIEs‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 07:58:42'] Couldn't agree more, my summary is below, the points are in more detail in this video [https://youtu.be/gtRU\_6mj4k4](https://youtu.be/gtRU_6mj4k4) &#x200B;To cut a long story short I think it's 50/50 for this quarter but that the next quarters are going to bring much softer results. Here's some bullet points of why:      Covid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.    AI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.    High Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.    Insider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years. The worst is that the CFO is now doing it which is the one person in the company that knows best about valuations.    If you want more details you can watch my video on YouTube by searching 'NVDA TickerTaco'.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:24:12'] So I have learned my lesson on shorting or buying puts early. What you want to do is buy long exp put spreads, usually twice as long exp wise as you think you‚Äôll need. So for Nvda, buy put spreads expiring at least in July, if not September. That way you‚Äôll be protected from theta, and if the price runs, you can buy back the short and have more upside if your spirit has not been broken by that point. And If the stock does fall, you‚Äôll be able to sell for a gain.Another option is to short the stock while buying puts 5-10 strikes out of the money. You won‚Äôt net much but you‚Äôll be able to sleep at night if the stock runs up a bit
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:27:44'] Yes they might make their own in house chips but will it be as good as nvda? They've been doing this for yearsssss. It's literally one of their main focuses. Idk.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:28:47'] Agreed, market timing can be a bitch though so i have about 25k in summer 2024 LEAPs
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 07:58:41'] Just some clarification:The reason I go for shorter-dated, far OTM puts is because timing is impossible for these kinds of shorts. Therefore, I'd rather throw $10k at a gamble like this with 300-1000% upside if it works, than throw $50k at puts that expire 6-12 months from now with 50-200% upside. I know I'm simplifying the greeks drastically, but the essence is that if timing is impossible, might as well risk less capital for higher upside potential. If the first $10k position blows up, this gives me the opportunity to sit back, relax, and wait to potentially reload another position in the near future.Whereas if I got the entry price wrong for a larger, deeper put - they will have lost 30-60% of their value anyway. From a psychology perspective, it's much easier for me to dismiss a smaller position loss and cut my chasing rather than hoping for my large, bleeding position to recoup it's value. Waiting for deep OTM puts to recover is mentally exhausting and draining.

Intel's cash flows are gone, and at the current state of things, this whole "Intel will dominate the chip manufacturing business" is pure speculation, which is the reason why Intel's share price is where it is.An investment is favourable when the best case scenario makes you a lot of money, whereas the worst-case scenario does not make you end up with a substantial permanent loss of capital. You do you, of course, but in my opinion, Intel does not provide such balance right now.

They have a huge disadvantage in battery life and efficiency.  The only reason they hold on to market share is they spend a lot to build there moat.  2- Intels stock price is like where it was 20 years ago‚Ä¶.. when they had a technology lead!!  Now they are 2-3 years behind. 3- they are uncompetitive on their most profitable segment‚Ä¶. Where AMD is expected to continue to take market share close to 40% as Intel has no competitive servers on their roadmap until 2025.4- profits are going to decrease tremendously‚Ä¶. They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry‚Ä¶.how will they compete but on cost?5-  Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI?  The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space‚Ä¶. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?6- This post makes me want to ü§¢ ü§Æ.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 09:44:27'] I wouldn't touch any of them. Intel has a real risk of fading away with manufacturing & execution issues. AMD is a bit over valued but my bigger concern is how much they dilute their shareholders. And then there is NVIDIA which has the best business of the three but the valuation is simply absurd.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 22:53:53'] >They say to sell the pickaxes to the gold rush. The pickaxe for AI will be the cutting edge chips, and that means Intel.AI = GPUs and custom silicon... Intel has nothing to offer there. It's a one man show with NVIDIA right now and later this year AMD offering their own MI100 chips. And yeah those comments from Nvidia were certainly encouraging for Intel but that doesn't mean the pickaxes will be fabbed in the US rather than Taiwan and South Korea - though Intel getting up to the standard that they can even be used by NVDA as a bargaining chip to haggle for lower prices with TSMC is a good sign for them.Lastly the margins for them making other companies AI chips will be lower than the margins for those actually designing and selling them. Again Intel is far behind in designing it's own AI chips.100% agree with you that NVDA is way overpriced though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 05:46:26'] There are certainly bad companies. Buying Intel as a bet on China invading Taiwan is gambling on a long shot.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 23:33:34'] I don't understand the rabid fanbase regarding these.  Nvidia is priced very high right now, they have to keep garnering great interest and performing well just to stay stable. AMD is in a similar state, lots of hype, priced high, has to maintain this momentum to stay up.  Then we have Intel, the company priced low, has been showing some positive news, although it's still early.  Government tossing money their way, history of turning AMD's leads around, and potentially may be able to hit AMD at its strongest GPU market, low and mid end.These things are well within reason, Nvidia and AMD have a massive amount of pressure to continue, Intel just needs to not fuck up.  Currently, it looks good long.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 15:16:12'] Right off the bat, I believe Intel's GPUs have been shelved. They aren't proceeding with them. You should listen to Moore's Law is Dead   YouTube channel. AMD may come out better than both NVDIA and Intel in my opinion. AI won't sustain demand (it's a one and done for most customers), Whereas AMDs GPU section is gaining market share at NVDIA's expense, which is a yearly market. Not $1 trillion mind you, but I don't think NVDIA is worth $1 trillion either.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 08:41:02'] You got your dd facts ass backwards. The argument should be ‚Äúif‚Äù taiwan gets invaded‚Ä¶. Thn amd/tsm are overvalued not nvda. Nvda is a US company and doesnt fab its components. Its components are assembled by companies like tsm or amd. Therefore ‚Äúif‚Äù taiwan is invaded intel would be picking up the slack. However intel is far behind technology wise compared to its peers tsm/amd hence why you dont see intel taking off like amd. Also, the basis of this whole thesis on if a country gets invaded is an insane thesis of why to buy a stock. Stop trying to bangwagon  chase shit. if you missed the hype. You missed the hype ‚Äî better luck next time. Dont falsely claim shit for pppl to follow your lack of knowledge
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 06:27:17'] 2. Intel PC Cpu is low margin as they are on price war with AMD. 3. No, it‚Äôs not competitive with Nvidia/AMD GPU and no, next gen is unlikely to beat the next gen of the other two. 4. No, Pat is more of marketing background and he keeps posting religion shit tweets, which proves that he is not data-driven decision maker but rather go with his emotion. 5. Yes it‚Äôs good but Nvidia will not immerse both legs in Intel lake. So, I don‚Äôt see any high margin from Fab business. 6. It‚Äôs true but those fabs are expensive to maintain. If only like 20-30% capacity is running, those fabs are more of liability rather than asset. 7. Come on, that‚Äôs just a big desperate ‚Äúif‚Äù. Intel is a classic value trap. Dun invest in it until they show better performance.

If they manage to solve FSD not only will that save lives but it will transfer over to Optimus which itself has a massive TAM. It‚Äôs amazing what the bot is already able to do comparing 2021 when it was first revealed to now. And it will be very cheap to produce and scale.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 01:01:35'] The problem with Nvidia is the same problem you get in every single market: high volumes and high margins attract competition and investment. But worse, because you're in tech and you're only as good as your latest products. Companies very often get complacent when they are market leaders (see Oracle, IBM, Intel recently).AMD was never lured to fight much Nvidia on the peanuts of the gaming market, they never made any money on pc GPU, but this may change with AI. Intel too has recently started competing.Point is: what really matters to customers of those GPUs eventually is how much computing power they get for their money. There's different models and different software out there.Anybody expecting Nvidia to dominate without a competition for a decade clearly does not understand the complexity of long term dominance in tech which is very hard to obtain and maintain.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 21:37:38'] With the pump after hours the stock is still down over 35% from its all time high and yet its still incredibly overvalued. I remember arguing with u/apooroldinvestor back in November who was convinced this company would never go below $300.00 a share and I will say what I said then. This stock is the very definition of a bubble. The valuation is absolutely egregious no matter what metrics you use. The company is priced beyond perfection. The company is trading over a 500 BILLION DOLLARS! That is about the same size if you were to take all the biggest semi-conductors like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instrument‚Äôs, and Broadcom together and combined them! In what world does this make any sense to anybody? On top of trading at high multiples they had earnings declines which a company priced to over perfection should not exist period. This company has a lot more to fall before I even consider touching it. Right now the only thing moving this stock is pure speculation cause its for sure not the fundamentals that is moving it. This stock is completely disconnected from any fundamentals. Up over 50% in just 2 months. No thank you, staying away. I am leaving this to you u/apooroldinvestor and the other Nvidia fanboys.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 14:47:27'] I am fascinated by the reaction. A company that is valued at +120x Earnings, and +110x FCF reports +20% decline in revenue YoY, and weak guidence, and everyone celebrating?It is even worse when people spam the comments criticising any negative comment, and labeling it as a "positive sign." In nuthsell, they reported:* Revenue down 21%* Margin down 2pts* Expenses up 27%* Operating Income down 58%* Net Income, wait for it, down 53%* CFFO down 55%* YoY FCF, you guessed it, down 53%Numbers don't lie. I don't understand how anyone can skim through their earnings, and end up with, THIS IS GREAT. Even the positives with the data centers and auto revenue growth, it doesn't justify this. Companies that are valued at 120x shouldn't report negative growth. You like? Buy it. just don't justify non-sense.

As if the people actually moving a $500B company didnt know about PE or YoY numbers. NVDA is raking in the gains of years and years of work.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 18:15:57'] We do at thetagang. I sell options. Not on NVDA thankfully, but you can end on the wrong end of these trades.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 18:23:24'] I‚Äôm not an expert in market mechanics but I can think of some who would buy calls after a massive gain:1. People who think the price will still increase the day before or the day of expiry (in NVDA‚Äôs case, most contracts are expiring tomorrow. That‚Äôs two full days of the price potentially increasing post-earnings. 2. People who plan to exercise the contract.3. Naked Put Sellers4. Market Makers for Delta Hedging5. ScalpersProbably many more reasons why, but remember the price of the option is directly related to the price of the underlying so if you bought a call for $80 that was $8 the day prior, the only reason it‚Äôs now worth $80 the day before expiration is because it‚Äôs intrinsic value is close to $80.Also, for every buyer, there is a seller and vice-versa. The person who sold the call either sold it naked in the first place, or they had the 100 shares of the underlying in their account in case it‚Äôs exercised. Market makers will generally buy/sell to provide liquidity and to earn some change off the spread.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 23:58:33'] After the price run up, some people and hedge fund algorithms are trying to find the right prices for a put/call straddle that pays off with enough volatility. For example, tomorrow, NVDA is likely to be volatile, whether it moves up or down. If it closes at the same price, then that would be a seemingly unlikely event. You are supposed to be able to exactly calculate the values of puts and calls for a long straddle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_modelHowever, you need to know the volatility to be able to calculate the prices. What volatility are you going to use? The volatility from the last 5 minutes? 5 years? All time? What is the drift? How do you define the drift? These problems are hard, but it doesn't stop some hedge funds from making money sometimes. Some hedge funds also lose World-Economy-Shattering sums of money. Some of the people who made the model won the Nobel prize for economics and then almost crashed world markets trading in Russia, saying that it was a sigma-six, infinitesimally improbable event and that no one could know that the value of the ruble would collapse. But that's not true at all. Even assuming Gaussian distributions for price volatility is only a first-order approximation on a distribution that may be skewed or have long tails. So basically some economists pretended to solve a problem by sweeping undefined variables under the rug. But, if you have an estimate of volatility and drift, you can play games with puts and calls, and your estimates will be good some of the time. That's one reason why so many shares are traded by algorithms.

The primary catalyst for this tech growth was Nvidia's earnings report, released after yesterday's market close.\n\nWhat's happening with NVIDIA?\n\nDespite a decline in revenue and net profit by 13% and 20% respectively, the reported figures significantly outpaced analysts' predictions. Furthermore, the company announced impressive sales for Q2 2023 that surprised even the most bullish investors. Pre-market NVIDIA shares surged by 24%, and since the opening bell, the growth has topped 25%. A little more momentum, and Nvidia will join the $1 trillion club.\n\nIn my view, this is a fascinating story that highlights the 135% increase in NVIDIA's share price over the past year, which ha largely been attributed to the booming popularity of AI.\n"

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:26:25'] People keep talking about Nvidia. I think we should look at the big picture.This Nvidia pump was just a way for the big money to make the indexes go up, and try to suck retail investors in, just before the debt ceiling crisis. Institutional investors want to take gains now and buy back when we get a 10-15% pullback over the next few weeks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 05:21:17'] I am neither buying or selling nvidia right now. it seems grossly overvalued but has had strong momentum.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 06:02:09'] It's hard to say what Nvidia should be valued at.There are people who point at NVDA's 130 PE.But when that 130 PE came from 2022 which included the following: 2.17bn inventory charges, china chip ban, 1.35bn arm termination fee, change to proof of stake destroying crypto mining (NVDA's 'gaming' revenue which was cut in half), worldwide poor macro conditions (rate hikes + inflation) leading to companies and consumers cutting spending where possible, gaming GPU is one of the first to be cut in the personal budgetI'm sure I could be forgetting a few things but I would not use 2022 as an indicator of the future given the above are either one-off events (termination fees and write downs which added back brings NVDA's PE to 70) or factors outside of NVDA's control (chip ban and interest hikes)Their recent massive rally can be justified depending on whether the AI boom will fuel NVDA sales in the long term which is highly speculative.There's also the scenario that AI does take off, but their large customers develop their own chips. 'Gaming' alone will never justify their market cap, that's why they're chasing the corporate money.The reason I've personally been holding for a long time is:1. One of the very few if not the only mega tech company still run by the founder who is also an engineer. MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META and GOOGL all became massive in their fields under the leadership of their founders.2. History shows that while there are failures, the investors who hit  at home-run 100x bagger are the ones who held AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA when their futures were NOT certain and the valuations were NOT 10-20 PE. AMZN was always (still is) unprofitable or trading at insane PE ratios, yet that didn't stop them from being a great investment. When TSLA when burning cash and their survival was in question, that was the time where an investor hit it 100x. AAPL once had triple digit PE before the massive iPhone profits came in. MSFT was before my time but who invested in the 80s or early 90s when a PC in every home was NOT the norm, nor was it inevitable it would be the norm.3. While it paid for earlier NVDA investors, and some think it's too late (it may be too late) I remember people thinking AAPL half a trillion market cap was too late. People who invested when AAPL was the biggest company in the world a decade ago were rewarded with 1000%+ return when including dividends.There is speculative upside and downside, always will be, but I think long term investors ought to be optimists just seeing how companies continue to surprise in how much innovation (and profits) they can deliver. Name ANY tech company today and they ALL had doubters as they climbed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 05:26:59'] The question isn't whether NVIDIA will grow. It's highly likely that it will. The question is how the market has priced this in ‚Äì will it make way more money than the valuation indicates?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 06:10:51'] I think we priced in flying ai robots at this point.  if they don't make them in a few years the stock will crater
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 14:32:13'] My own feelings, take it or leave it, is we are 10 years from AI replacing or augmenting most human jobs, and every company which is left will be deploying as much AI performance as they can. Allied to that, VR will be ubiquitous as a means to placate a large unemployed human workforce. At that point, nvidia will sell every chip they can manufacture. I‚Äôm in nvidia largely as a hedge in case the above comes true.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 09:50:28'] I think it's wildly speculative at current valuation. We generally have a pretty good understanding of the gaming segment and the growth trajectory of data centers. What is far more speculative is the impact of this current AI mania. Clearly the market has priced it as an enormous profit driver. It's far from obvious that will be the case. I would consider NVDA to be a gamble at current valuation, rather than an investment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 11:06:36'] I think GeForce Now has gigantic potential if they can expand their library. You can stream at 120 fps 1440p with a \~10 ms delay on a cabled connection. I'm playing on a mac and it's mostly indistinguishable from an actual gaming PC. Do the math, and it saves you money (and lots of trouble) compared to buying your own hardware. It's not perfect, but it's getting good enough that it could seriously take off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 07:29:32'] I'm bullish... at $100.I can either buy AMD + INTC + QCOM + TXN and still have enough for another profitable midcap.Or I can buy NVDA.That's how expensive it is.The question isn't will they grow, but is the current valuation ($237.5 / $585B?!) a good enough deal that it will outperform competitors as well as the overall market, my personal guess is no.AI will be useful, but it's getting priced in far too quickly ala EVs, weed, dotcom, and other fads.

Until you can see actual improvement to their financials as a result of it, this is just speculation just like the Metaverse. Sure in 10 years, it may be huge... but we can't price that in today. Nvidia is more expensive today than in late 2021... which is insane considering back then you had a ton of tailwinds going for them (crypto was booming and spending was high across businesses and consumers).

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 22:21:22'] I‚Äôm a believer in net income because it isn‚Äôt cheap to get TSMC to make your stuff and do R&D. The combined net income for the last 4 quarters is 4.3 billion dollars. Nvidias market cap is 686 billion dollars. CUDA is definitely the dominant backend but at that valuation it has to stay that way forever. What specifically caused this spike in market cap? Large language models. What if there is specialized hardware developed for these that does not need a general purpose GPU? How many firms are going to deploy these models and how many GPUs will they buy? Is crypto mining going to be hot in a 5% risk free environment? Will the Nintendo Switch 2 increase revenues? I think a lot of good news and perfect execution has been priced in so I‚Äôm not bullish at the current price. That being said the final step I like to take in my analysis is to inverse my opinion as I am usually critically wrong about something. So my final answer is hyper bullish.

Given that they are already the market leader by far in their categories, you are betting on an explicit demand on GPUs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 10:35:41'] I'd sell. The valuation is difficult to justify at this point unless you basically assume the bull case.It could do fine, but it's hard to see how it would be a huge relative winner from here. You'd probably need to be betting on the macro (in which case why NVDA?) or the AI hype accelerating further.Otherwise there seems to be a lot of down side risk near-term. Demand obviously isn't great right now. and it's not clear how long that will last, the AI hype might be overplayed near-term, and the valuation is currently stretched.Long-term I worry more about competition. Investors pay a premium for NVDA because of its dominant position in AI, and while I'm not going to claim I'm an expert in this space, from what I've read there's a reason to think others like AMD and maybe INTC could erode their marketshare with time. Believers will tell you, "it will never happen!", but it's amazing how much disruption and change can in a decade in tech.My personal view is sell, take the gain and look for an attractive reentry price. I think NVDA is going to be volatile with large swings up and down, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price is only slightly higher than it is today in 5 years.

Momentum may differ from value, for instance.One old saying though is that "if it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to sell".  And you posting your big gains is effectively the same as a screenshot.  My discipline means I tend to capture rapid gains of 20-40%.  You won't go broke making short term 20% gains.But it does make me ponder when I've taken a quick 30% gain and then something goes 200-300% after that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 18:37:17'] The size of the GPU market globally is just not large enough to justify their current valuation. All this AI hype has people thinking it‚Äôs going to explode, but it‚Äôs oversold. The Cloud boom was driving a lot of that, especially from the heavy hitters like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. Their cloud growth is slowing down, and those companies already have a shit ton of GPU capacity. Frankly AMD (with their Xilinx acquisition) could end up being positioned better than Nvidia for AI workloads. You‚Äôre almost assuredly going to see an AMD FPGA integrated directly into a 2nm CPU die, directly into a GPU die, or perhaps a dedicated AI system build, with multiple low nm FPGA‚Äôs on the motherboard along with multiple GPUs. FPGA‚Äôs are also very futureproof, as by definition they are reprogrammable. At some point it‚Äôs conceivable that ML model structure will shift, such that GPU‚Äôs become significantly slower than FPGA‚Äôs or ASIC‚Äôs due to design efficiencies gained by directly constructing circuits to run or train specific ML architectures.Crypto continuing to move to proof of stake will continue to shrink that market segment also.Also, their consumer GPU‚Äôs could already hit 90fps at 4K on the previous generation (3xxx series), so there is very little need to upgrade to a 4xxx.Too many uncertainties (for me) to justify a ~600B valuation, on what‚Äôs looking like a ~$4bn profit year in 2023. That‚Äôs like a 150x P/E, in the face of those headwinds/risks, plus recession and overall equity risk‚Ä¶ Oh also, Biden banned their top end AI chips to the 2nd biggest market, China.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 16:18:44'] I wouldn't buy either atm
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 14:13:00'] Nvidia is clearly the better company, but it‚Äôs too expensive to own right now given its high PE. Intel is cheap on a PE basis but only on paper. It has been losing market share to both AMD and Nvidia for years now. All that to say, if you want exposure to the semiconductor industry, it‚Äôs better to simply buy SOXX. That way, no matter who wins, you make money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 14:30:55'] As someone who follows this space, the biggest differentiator in AI is the fact that NVDA also owns CUDA which is software.  Intel has nothing on that front.  For those that don't know, think of CUDA like windows if your computer ran on GPUs instead of CPUs.So NVDA can supply you with all the hardware AND software you need to train and deploy AI models.  Intel has no high performance computing (HPC) GPU for the datacenter and no competitive software offering.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 17:30:53'] Intel has pretty much nothing to do with the latest breakthroughs in AI research. In the machines that train AI models, their CPUs are mostly interchangeable with AMD. The same is NOT true for Nvidia, all the models and training processes are optimized for Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 17:55:35'] you buy Intel for turnaround potentialyou buy Nvidia for the momentum (though i believe it is already way overbought due to AI craze)
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 14:33:42'] In my opinion, the best short term trades are currently crowded and likely to underperform. (October to Jan was the window to go long in high premium stocks like NVDA, I piled into AMD and SMH personally. Wouldn't buy here.) If you want to trade individual stocks, *wait for a pullback* as it is very unlikely stocks with high expectations like Nvidia and AMD due to AI will meet growth expectations this year with the China sanctions in place alongside businesses and consumers pulling back unnecessary costs. Current macro will not be friendly to having all this future growth priced in, earnings calls will be reality checks. AI is promising, but it's hype like all the EV and renewable energy stocks that spiked and dropped last year when earnings didn't back them up. I'd also avoid concentrating in Intel. If you want to invest long term in the area today for the next 10-50 years, the industry moves quickly so it isn't generally a good idea to go all into individual stocks for investing, go etfs.I'd recommend buying QQQM and SMH (more diversity and weight to foundries, semi machinery, and international than SOXX) every paycheck and being done with it for long term. Near term I don't see untapped value re: AI available at these prices and in this environment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 09:53:44'] NVDA extremely expensive. The optimistic 10 year growth scenario has been priced in TODAY. More risk than reward.INTC is also risky because it has not shown market share turnaround, it's still declining in all aspects, thus it is quite cheap at the moment.I'd buy the ETF for exposure but position shouldn't be big.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-18 13:29:05'] I don‚Äôt own both but I have thought about buy both at some point. With that said,NVIDIA is too expansive for me while INTEL is really great at dropping the ball on a consistent basis while just going through the motions. INTEL has this ‚Äú oh well‚Äù attitude while AMD dominating them.NVIDIA is a safe play but I wouldn‚Äôt take INTEL if I got it for free.  Micron and AMD are safe but they are not in AI like NVDA.

SMH hasn‚Äôt performed well last year bc of chip inventory glut that needed worked off for most of the holdings but that seems to be in the past for the most part .

With that frame of reference, Nvidia's fundamentals were pressured by a slowdown in gaming, crypto-mining and the broader personal computer market. However, on the backdrop of the ChatGPT tailwind, NVDA stock has started to rebound aggressively, reflecting investor optimism about the potential of generative AI technology.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the tailwind that Nvidia is likely to see from AI computing, I also argue that the thesis remains speculative, given the early stages of the technology.

I think once the dust settles down, companies wont be that aggressive buying up these GPUs. Plus on AI chips there will be competition. Not just from existing incumbents but from start ups making custom ASICs specifically for AI training/inference. Margins on these chips are so high that I expect Nvidia to not have it easy for sure. I dont think barrier of entry is that high as long as they support the right APIs/frameworks. In this high interest market and possible recession, valuation makes ZERO sense.

Depending on the price you pay for a piece of ownership, it can be better to buy the second company rather than the first. Ofc, we ordinary people will always buy and focus on the company, not the stock which is fine as long as we dont mind volatility. It's easy, just buy an okay company low and sell it high or buy a great company and never sell.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 14:30:40'] I'm sure the market knows better than me here, but I seriously don't understand what the market is so bullish about on this stock. The fact it's down less than 4% after hours on a miss of this size is quite surprising.Income down 72% in a year for a company of NVDA's size is nuts. That level of cyclicality is typically heavily discounted in the earnings multiple, which if you think is bad now, just wait until that E comes down.Plus what's the bull case here? Is crypto about to bounce back or something? And even if it does isn't proof of stake a thing now?I've been saying this is a $120 stock for some time now, but honestly after this earnings report I'm not sure I'd buy for $120. If I thought this was as bad as it's going to get then, then fine, but even if they turn this thing around tomorrow it would still be trading at a huge market premium. I get the long-term story and all, but at $170 most of that growth is already priced in.

They should have to disclose mining sales since its such a large portion of their revenue and be held accountable for misleading investors such as when geforce owner were willing to pay $200 more for an upgrade.

If gaming recovers in calendar year 2023, the YoY comps will be insane.Also in outlook was the weak next quarter was due to preparing for NVDA's new generation product. Depending on how good their next gen is, the following quarter may be massive. Basically bad headline numbers for this quarter and next, however upside catalysts are there. They're only 410bn market cap now, data center should generate at least 5bn in profits in the following year, which is a 80x multiple on data center only. If gaming revenue recovers following the next gen release, it could very well be trading at less than 40x multiple going forward half year

The guidance by the CEO isn't that straightforward towards the shareholders and the big share holders don't seem to be speaking up about the management of Nvidia4. Lastly, Nvidia was sewed a couple of months ago for poor guidance of crypto earnings in 2018 and still, now big shareholders aren't speaking about their management as much.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 09:43:50'] I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs said enough but INTEL and Nvidia are different businesses. One has Fab and one doesn‚Äôt. That difference alone makes them semi incomparable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:40:23'] Intel: This is the only one manufacturing its own chips.Nvidia: They recently released their own CPU, so a lot of growth that can happen on that.

Intelat the moment
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:37:45'] Nvidia and AMD for now. They seem to be the only one doing interesting stuff these days while Intel almost seems like a boomer in semiconductor. That said, I could be suffering from recency bias and overestimate Nvidia and AMD and underestimate Intel. Only time will tell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:13:56'] Tsmc. They supply to all 3 lmfao.But AMD, if only from 3
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:42:08'] AMD
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 10:02:17'] Buy all of them IMO. AMD is actually competing decently in GPUs now, though its still gonna be 2 or 3 generations before they can compete for the absolute top end with AI, fully path traced games, basically just all the extra features Nvidia offers besides performance. Still good though, because most people don't take anything more than gaming or crytpto mining performance into account.Their CPUs are amazing and they're slowly chipping away at Intel's absolute dominance in enterprise systems. Nvidia is also a blind buy. Some people probably think they're the only GPU manufacturer that exists. They are the absolute best of the best in GPUs, which isn't hard since  there's only 2 lolIntel is making GPUs now too,but they're garbage and will stay garbage for I'm guessing 3 generations before they are seriously competing in the mid range. I have no clue when they'd be fighting with Nvidia for #1, but it's gonna happen at some point. Even though their CPUs aren't beating AMD by a landslide anymore, they still have a massive amount of market share and can easily make CPUs that don't use more energy than a thermal reactor. Its definitely worth looking at other companies like Qualcomm and Samsung as well, but I'd say these 3 are worth blind buying. Can you seriously imagine a future where we have LESS computers?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:22:55'] AMD is the only one I have money in directly.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:35:52'] ASML
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:46:16'] Short and long time frames AMD or Nvidia. Out of the two I prefer AMD better. AMD also posting earnings today, its a gamble to get in solely on that but my bet is that they are good. I wouldn't doubt AMD will go to $400 eventually.Intel is a more long term play. They've fallen behind big time over the last few years, especially in the realm of mainstream and enthusiast desktop processors. They are so behind on die size. I think they'll get back to shining but probably in 5-10 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:02:23'] I'm gambling on intel turning it around, but it's obviously a pretty big risk. In current times, when the world is looking to go back on the globalization a bit, I see it as a pretty big advantage that they manufacture their own chips. Nvidia is just too hyped for me, it's a great company and all, but I'm personally not too comfortable with the current valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:54:11'] NVDA ‚â• AMD > Intel
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:56:23'] I think all three will have trouble in the future due to competition from CSPs. Immediate threat is to Intel, but AMD and NVIDIA will also suffer. Their margins will compress and they will become commoditized. They will be around, but not as high margin businesses. INTC: Margins will continue to shrink. -Consumer: Apple moved to own chips, PC providers will likely have ARM-based chips from one or more vendors.-Data Center: Cloud providers moving to their own chips (e.g. Graviton for AWS, likely MS and Google are designing their own server chips). RISCV is also coming up.-AI chips: NVIDIA dominates, but cloud providers are also designing their own (TPU, Inferentia, Trainium, ‚Ä¶).  Also 100+ AI startups-Other business units are too small and highly competitive and low margin-Behind TSMC in manufacturing, custom foundry remains to be seen. Intel tried it before and failed, foundry is fundamentally a different business style than Intel is used to. Intel‚Äôs manufacturing unit has always had a captive customer (x86), now needs to fight for customers.Intel will survive, but as a shell of itself. Margins will be much lower, company will be much smaller, and revenues not grow fast. I think similar fate will also fall on AMD and NVIDIA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:16:09'] Amd by a long run so many buisness opportunities and acquisitions recently. TAM is only growing and the investor day was very impressive in terms of the road map for the future
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:01:59'] INTC's price to book is getting relatively attractive but I wouldn't be buying for growth. It'd be a foundry play for the div. 5-10 year hold with expectations of drawdowns and having plenty of contingencies for when to cut and run. Hold shares, drip divs into SMH and buy puts insurance going into earnings.AMD is solid, high growth, high margins in a good subsector of the semiconductor industry (B2B server and HPC). It's a buy under 85, valuation isn't insane.NVDA is overpriced and their growth doesn't justify the price. Good buy once crypto has fully gone into a freeze. If you want to hold through potential macro drawdowns they're the company with the best moat in their respective subsector for a retirement hold. Software like CUDA is a big advantage.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 09:10:10'] None. Intel looks cheap but declining fundamentals and manufacturing issues and losing market share.AMD & NVIDIA great companies but I can't justify their current prices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 10:36:13'] INTC is a long, long term play.  Getting back into the foundry business will take time and money (Ohio Plant).  I'm stuck with it, collecting my divi's and sell calls.   I also own a small position in NVDA at a gain.  And did puts and buy writes on AMD this morning.  Expect to be  called out.   My portfolio mostly holds dividend payers and dividend growers.  AMD and NVDA do not fit into my normal holdings.   AVGO has worked well for me on all fronts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:28:11'] I hold Amd and Nvidia. Intel is a solid long term hold but there‚Äôs a good chance you won‚Äôt see returns (outside of the dividend) for years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:09:14'] All are good. I like Intel at current price, but it‚Äôs definitely long term.I work in a large corporation and my branch just got new laptops for the employees. All i5s. As long as that remains the case, Intel will be a solid buy imo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 09:35:37'] Interesting you don't include Qualcomm.  Intel By far is my armchair pick.  But I think investing in all 3 is solid moves. Nvidia -  Grew because of Crypto.  Now they have to make the right investments and gambles again.  Unless Nvidia creates dedicated crypto chip/PCIE-card, and crypto has growth again, I don't expect them to have that explosive growth again.  That said their Full stack approach (software, UI, AI, verse, GPU), as well as server adoption puts it in a really good place for sustain and future.  This also allows them to do a software licensing to offset hardware costs.  I think they are making great investments.  The main issue is cost for stock price.  They aren't going anywhere. AMD - AMD is My short term pick.  If you are looking to sell next year, or at least reevaluate, AMD is my pick.  They are eating Marketshare.  They are making investments to get into Enterprise equipment.  They are creating top of line consumer CPUs and dominating low end. And their high end server grade are at least equal footing to Intel, if not better.  Their biggest hurdle is breaking into the trust between intel and companies have had for decades.  Their acquisition of Xilinx is a huge technology advancement. Again, I think they are making good investments, but they don't control fabs, and they don't control end product.  And they are pricey, but I can't fathom them not growing in 2 years. Intel.  My choice for intel, is it is low risk and high potential.  Which is ideal for stocks.  It is extremely cheap now, but will likely not improve much in the next year.  But they have fab, and plan to sell that fab space for other companies.  This is HUGE.  This is competition with TSMC. And they still have time to get their processes fixed.   They also don't just sell CPU/GPU. They have NICs, Memory, Ethernet, FPGAs.  Which are all small compared to their competitors.  They have the best case for a truly integrated SoC, which is good for servers.  Which they already have trust.   They are investing in GPU, Mobile, both are risky, but could pay off handsomely.   And their stock is cheap with dividends. The safest play is ETF in this space.  They are all going to win in some capacity, It is just a matter of who wins more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:16:20'] Of the three the only one I hold is intel and it‚Äôs purely a contrarian play. I like the turnaround story and I like the dividend and I felt comfortable parking some cash their to sit and reinvest for a few years while we see how things shake out
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:40:08'] My humble opinion, base on a feeling and my thinking: Best returns you will get - 1-4 years amd, 3-7 years Nvidia, 6-10 years Intel. Nvidia and AMD are in so much hype and grow they will definetly outperform intel in next few years. But in a long run i think Intel will just boringly outperform them all. Imagine the classic comperation of Buffet vs Cathy Wood. Wood massively outperformed Buffet at some point only to fall down and gets beaten by stability and consistency.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 12:54:47'] Grow the most - guessing Nvidia. Nvidia is good at software and has a *chance* at building platforms that scale revenue in ways a hardware focused company like AMD or Intel cannot.Best returns - probably AMD at this rate, because Nvidia would need twice as much earnings growth to justify share price in the long runDumpster fire - Intel, but maybe worth investing in 2-4 years if they can unfuck themselves.AMD and Nvidia have excellent execution dating back almost 10 years, Intel has had awful execution for the last few years. So I'm not going to bet on Intel until they stop performing like a loser. They have bright spots for sure but their business model is falling apart and the management isn't trustworthy in the least.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 13:24:54'] Nvidia because they also have phenomenal software. Have a look at Nvidia canvas or their driving assistance.

They are building plants in 'mercia, that maybe won't burn down as much as those in SE Asia seem to?    They just made a deal to make cell phone chips.Nvidia might have come out with a CPU, but it looks like an arm, where most software runs x86.    Apple's RISC didn't pay off and take over the world.   Maybe this arm will, stuff is more agnostic now.Nvidia and to a lesser extent AMD has been bolstered recently by crypto.    That's not going to last forever, eventually we'll run out of things to factor, or quantum computers will do it all in 5 minutes.  Only nerds and corporates have computers anymore.  Why spend the $600 on a video card for your $2000 gaming rig when you can just as well buy a console for $600 or play fartnight on your phone?  Corporates dgaf about graphics or performance really,  Intel embedded graphics show a spreadsheet outlook just fine.   MIPS designs the playstation chips, but they contract out the fabricating.   Intel's trying to grow that line of business, making chips for others.  On the otherhand, Xbox uses AMD.Recent run ups of Nvida and AMD, with a bunch of associated hype point me more toward Intel.   INTC's PE is 7.   NVDA's is 49  AMD's is 36.      Intel seems like a comparative value.Could be I'm an Intel holding fanboi.    Might be better to align yourself with the rest of reddit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:39:28'] The one that CAN grow the most is the fully integrated one that actually produces its own chips. However, actually achieving that growth is contingent on them executing on their new tech road map successfully.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:44:09'] Nvidia > AMD (hold both) because the future will be fat software margins. Their margins are already much fatter than AMD's margins.Nvidia has their hand in all the high growth areas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:53:21'] How are you even comparing these companies? Only one of them actually makes chips
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:57:10'] Buy a little of all 3.  I think Intel is the most underpriced right now, though.  The new CEO is steering them in the right direction, he has an engineering background and has been an instrumental part of some of their early chip designs (386, 486), unlike Intel's prior CEOs which were marketing people that focused on stock buybacks.  The true results of his work won't really be seen for 3-5 years, though.  After 5 years, its really hard to predict.  In my opinion, all 3 companies currently have good CEOs, and will likely do well while they are at the helm.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 08:01:06'] One of my personal rules is that I don‚Äôt pay a lot of attention to ‚Äúreasonably priced‚Äù after learning that lesson the hard way. Sometimes people want to enter an industry (e.g. semis) and don‚Äôt want to pay a premium for the market leader, so pick up the second-place competitor without factoring in quality of forward execution. Just because a company has more room to grow doesn‚Äôt it will be able to. Also, stocks are typically reasonably priced because the market doesn‚Äôt foresee strong performance over the next year or so.I really want to love Intel but they just haven‚Äôt proven to me that they have fixed their execution problems. Yes I‚Äôm hopeful about their fab investment but given how poorly they‚Äôve operated I (personally) am not ready to trust this leadership group with my investment dollars.Nvidia and AMD are well-run companies with strong execution and significant long-term tailwinds (despite short term headwinds).Note that I‚Äôm a long-term investor, not a trader. I am also an investor in NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 08:01:18'] Just from what I have read / watched in some comp-sci courses each company has chips that are better in a specific arena of the hardware. Intel has great chips for servers. AMD for personal computers, NVIDIA for personal computers that run multiple OS. It‚Äôs a small example, but as technology is added to everything from toasters to robots I think there will be room for specialization.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 08:02:56'] I like AMD, there was a really good opportunity for anyone who picked up around 70$. I like this one long-term. After that I'd pick Nvidia with Intel last. But I do believe long-term Intel can still be a winner with the right entries, expecting further drops in the short to medium term.Bullish on all three on a long enough timeframe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 08:06:02'] Personally doing Nvidia and AMD. I think Intel is a good long term hold but they keep facing delays with their products and it will take a while before their investments into Arc and Fabs see any meaningful returns.The question is how much lower will they go before going back up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 08:12:42'] Intel is a huge value trap right now. If you look just at the financials, it‚Äôs very solid. That‚Äôs why Ben Graham said that it takes more than accounting to stock pick - otherwise, accountants would be the richest people in the world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 08:28:43'] Nvidia is a strong player that will dominate for years to come, but the stock is expensive.AMD probably has the most growth opportunity left (both in terms of revenue and stock price), but they need to keep executing phenomenally like the have in recent years to maintain their growth (and their share price).Intel needs to prove it can turn their terrible company culture around before it becomes investible, which could take many years.

When you see ASML trending towards a down point buy - because it's always going to go up. I've made almost six figures over the past year trading it at highs and lows. It's a well-managed company, it holds high confidence, and it has a future. If there's an East Asian war (seeming more n more likely) Taiwan Semiconductor will for all intents and purposes simply not exist, making ASML debatably the second biggest player in the industry
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 09:41:27'] Since this is gonna be very likely one of the few comments I make before giving the signin to a friend, I think I'll tell you one thing for certain which's don't let go of NVIDIA. NVIDIA is gonna have an exponential growth given all the things they're into. I'm aware of this since I'm a Sr. S. Engineer living in Santa Clara. Just have NVIDIA with you, no matter what happens.Their Supercomputer solution stack, AI algorithms and Quantum Simulation software is gonna create history in the technology industry. NVIDIA Research is also extemely active in releasing their inventions to the World. You can find all the code on their research website. It must be your 1st choice in these 3.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 09:50:48'] nobody is looking in to shifting of the dynamics of the semiconductor industry, x86 based procs are going to extinct soon and the industry will move towards arm based archs, amd and intel are the major players in x86 segment which will be overtaken by apple own procs and other procs based on arm in mobile and server space, once apple comes with its own server procs intel  will be long gone by then, a ten watt m2 procs can compete with 150 watt intel procs, in farm scale this is going to be a game changer.out of these three, winner can be amd or nvidia, amd compete against nvidia in graphics space as well, but no one knows who will rule the semiconductor space, may be tesla, apple, Microsoft? sony? fb? ggle? all are having their own versions of processors for different purposes.

That‚Äôs how I view it, anyways. NVDA is my largest holding, but have significant allocation to AMD also. I have been in and out of intel. I don‚Äôt have much confidence. Looking at that chart over recent years just scares me away.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 14:02:26'] Intel has a very toxic company culture in its fabs. A lot of engineers fled the company within the past few years. They are underpaying and overworking people. The whole place runs on tribal knowledge and with the experienced people leaving, they are losing the knowledge and chasing issues that had been resolved in the past but noone knows what the solution was. They are far behind on the technology. I long sold all my position for INTC. There are much better companies to invest in.

Nvidia is way bigger in DC and also a big player in automotive market. Their Gross Margin is way higher than AMD(65 vs 48). On AMD side they are growing even faster. I would say have both instead of either or. I would say basket approach with NVDA, AMD, TSM, ASML and TXN would be a great basket to own medium to long term.

The real smart play on chips is KLAC which I have a smaller position in now but want to build on.EDIT: Also Intels dividend provides some comfort, but again theyre last earnings report may have put it at risk.

I‚Äôve been building NVDA and AMD for a while because I use their products, but Intel has US based manufacturing and the CHIPS act really favors them. That, and the fact that they are down because AMD has owned the momentum in the last couple years is leading me to believe Intel has mid to long term upside on any performance gap closing improvements.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 17:41:54'] AMD & NVDA are stars. INTC is a dog.Fabs are a money pit unless you really know what you‚Äôre doing. TSM knows. Intel does not. It‚Äôs pretty obvious.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 20:23:51'] I think a lot of people over rate having a fab. Fabs don't make near as much revenue as the main company, Intel is just so massive they could afford it but AMD could technically buy back their spin off company global foundries and bring it up to speed. What is the real issue here is what company has room to grow and has demonstrated this yearly. It's AMD, it competes in a growing sector of sales and more and more compute farms come online daily with big big companies like AWS and Google buying high margin server parts as fast as they can be made. In the past AMD had something as low as 5% market share and Intel has 90% while now AMD has 20 and Intel 70 roughly. This shows in a big way in the company's revenue. The last factor I will mention is Intel pays dividends but AMD only does buy backs and is slated for an increase from 1bil to 8bil buy backs for the coming year. This pretty much means the company is signaling which of the categories it falls into. The AMD execs quote 20% growth and I honestly believe them. I believe them so much that I passed an Intel RnD job that I would have loved for a lower paying position at AMD. I had a research project they sponsored at my uni but also had an AMD internship previously and weighed my options to end up here.Also a last word, I don't think either company is going anywhere and I think Intel has so much promise in emerging technology and fabrication. Nvda I don't know enough about but I will say ... With new AI accelerating units and integrated graphics as well as a potential rework of crypto ... I'm not as sold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 20:44:02'] INTC based on the current valuation, dividend yield, and the size of their company (they aren't going anywhere). They have been a household name for decades and will continue to be as the chip space sees more and more demand. NVDA looks very attractive on it's huge recent dip but AMC has had a crazy run the past few years. Best not to buy stocks after they have had huge run-ups like that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 01:58:18'] I actually worry about all three over the very long term.   The trend is for the big guys to make their own chips more and more.Take Google.  They already do all their own AI training and inference chips both client and cloud.   The TPUs are also pretty impressive."Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records ‚Äî And We Aren't Surprised"https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-recordsGoogle is also doing their own in their Pixel phones and rumored to be coming out with a tablet and Chromebook with their silicon.Apple was already doing their phone and tablet. But now doing their own for their laptop. Tesla did their own for AI applications.I believe you will continue to see this trend.  The world has changed and the big tech companies just are a lot bigger than they were in the past.  There is much more concentration and that creates an exceptable ROI on doing your own chips.It is only going to get worse as the big guys continue to just grow like crazy.   In 2015 when Google did the TPU they were a $75B company.  Google is now 4X the size and will break $300 billion in 2022 with no end in site.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\n\nAnalysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.\n\nSo far, posit'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 17:30:00'] Longest bear market since the 1940s? Then what was 2000-2002?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:13:21'] Good to know. Everything fixed in a day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:44:29'] This recession is most anticipated and predicted recession in history. Business and individuals alike should be and have been preparing. Secondly, when there finally is a recession I don‚Äôt believe it last very long because again. Everyone sees it coming so if your not positioned correctly thats on you
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 21:49:25'] Not sure I'm a bear but I'm about 40% cash right now as I liquidate my tech stocks to rebalance into VTI. I don't understand how we can be in a new bull market when y/y quarterly results were worse. Shouldn't income be rising/improving to be in a bull market? Also, interest rates in MMFs are paying more than inflation and have 0 risk. &#x200B;As an engineer I didn't think tech stocks should've taken the crazy beating they endured last year, but I also don't think they should hit ATHs this year when rates are 5+% and income has been flat. Very confusing stuff. Honestly, maybe we fairly or slightly overvalue at the moment. IF in 1-2 quarters we see better company y/y results than ya we'd be in a bull market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 22:53:51'] Welp the bull market was fun while it lasted, cue the band
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:10:16'] So why the Fed pause? If the markets are calm and we just entered a new bull market, there‚Äôs no excuse for the Fed not to continue rate hikes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 21:29:08'] Longest bear market does not sound right. This is not the great depression
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 19:21:52'] Right, guess this means the market is about to crash.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 03:38:04'] Congrats to all those that thought they were smarter by sitting on cash. That bottom you were hoping for is about 6 months in the rear view mirror. r/stocks, never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 03:16:36'] seriously looks like a bear trap to me. how can the market actually go up when quantitative easing has ended and the commercial bubble burst looming just months away? where would all this money come from to boost up stocks?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:46:32'] There‚Äôs a few catalysts that could ruin the party. I‚Äôm mostly worried about geopolitical tensions with China, though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 03:51:23'] What bullshit. The only reason the whole goddamn thing hasn‚Äôt collapsed is because the fed just keeps printing money and bailing everyone out. Its fuckery at the highest and worse possible level. Wallstreet is a fucking casino.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 06:52:36'] I think some clarification here is needed."mini-bear" or mini-bull markets are pretty meaningless. As investors, the only thing we should care about are long-term, secular bear markets.The period 1973 - 1977 was a long-term secular bearThe period 2000 - 2009 was another, and one of the worst investing periods in US history aside from the 1930s. Not only were stocks complete trash, but dividend yields were at historic lows. There are dozens of stocks that peaked in early 2000 that are still down 40% or more 23 years later (Cisco for instance)The 1970s bear market was bad, but a repeat of that doesn't worry me too muchA repeat of 2000 - 2009 would be ruinous for stock holders --that is a scenario which keeps me up at night

The current reading is the lowest since March 2021. In contrast, long-run inflation expectations were little changed from May at 3.0%, again staying within the narrow 2.9-3.1% range for 22 of the last 23 months. Long-run inflation expectations remained elevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 11:56:21'] I dunno how ya‚Äôll are feeling, but to me it‚Äôs kinda crazy how different the vibes are in the market for 2023 comparatively to 2022. I did not think any green that happened during 2022 would last and every morning when I saw green I was highly skeptical and just assumed it would end red lol.Now in 2023, I feel the complete opposite. Any day I see even a bit of red I assume it‚Äôs instantly gonna get bought up and that we will end green.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 13:44:10'] Why do people constantly say the market topped when there is just one red day? Shouldnt those type of calls wait for multiple red days in a row lol. Especially when the red day is before a three day weekend where people always take profits anyway since they dont want to hold through the holiday.

I remember buying the -20% dip in 2018 December because fed had hiked to 2.25% lmao.Just adding PE wise we are trading as if economy is expanding. GDP growth in 2019 was 2.25%, interest rate 1.75%, earnings growth was like 10%. So to buy here near 20, you need to think next year has very strong earnings growth and lower interest rates.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 03:42:38'] It is not.  Specially for the long term.

That is a better place to invest, IMO.The trend of the big guys doing their own chips is only going to increase.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 08:28:47'] Well, if you have extreme confidence in your thesis and valuation/ future cash flow forecasts, it can be OK. If you're asking basic questions about investing, prolly not. With the caveat being if it's a tiny portfolio and you're just wanting to gamble, go for it. But if you are going to do it make sure you're confident enough to be able to hold through bad times. Concentrated portfolios can drop heavily if the sector or company is struggling and if there is no depth to your tech is the future these companies will do well next bull market theory it can lead to getting scared/shaken out and jumping ship which is a disaster obviously.

The graphics behemoths from California were considered the technical leaders. But on Friday, the US market leader ended the decades-long relationship with a bang.\nEVGA speaks openly about how frustrated the card manufacturers are with Nvidia's business practices. First there were no chips available for months, now the manufacturers' warehouses are suddenly full with cards that will be obsolete in just a few weeks. EVGA claims to currently make a loss with every graphics card sold. Nvidia dictated prices and quantities for months and thus got its hardware partners into trouble.\nSo..

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-18 19:17:33'] One more strike against Nvidia.  They seem to be pilling up.  To me the biggest is how all these companies are now making chips themselves.Google was already with the TPUs and they have been setting records.  "Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records ‚Äî And We Aren't Surprised"https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-recordsTesla has now done the same.But saw Cruise announced last week they would do their own instead of using Nvidia.Next biggest in terms of negative financially is the move away from proof of work with crypto.The EVGA in the scheme of things is very small but it is one more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-19 02:02:49'] Nvidia doesnt want their suppliers to have good margins, they want all the margin themselves. Sucks for the suppliers but as a shareholder it is what it is...I guess they move towards to vertically integrate the whole supply chain up to selling their own consumer cards.

EVGA has been the top AIB partner for Nvidia for about 2 decades. They have designed the very best card of each generation usually and have such strong customer loyalty that I think if they started building AMD cards then a not insignificant amount of their customers would go with them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-19 00:27:25'] From arstechnica https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/evgagraph.pngNvidia knows what they are doing and evga just cannot how with this decrease. I guess Nvidia will just increase own production and doubt this will have any impact, unless evga change mind and go for AMD.Much more concerning for Nvidia is Ethereum becoming gpu independent and huge stock of 3000 on all levels. Only way to combat will be insane pricing of 4000 to make 3000 as value proposition still attractive even with 4000 being offered. But that will cut deep into their pockets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-18 19:22:52'] Tough on EVGA. What are they going to do, sell cantaloupes?  I suppose they could cross the lines to Team Red..Two sides to every story. Perhaps EVGA's foresight was misguided and someone dropped the ball and now they put all the blame on NVIDIA?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-18 20:40:47'] This won't negatively effect them at all. NVIDIA won't sell less chips, they'll just sell them to EVGAs competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-19 08:28:03'] It‚Äôs fairly certain that there is another side of that story. If it was just a problem of Nvidia, they would not be leaving the business that makes 80% of their revenue. They could partner up with AMD or Intel. Something is up with EVEGA and we are not being yet told what. Anyways, doubt that this will affect Nvidia. FE gpus are fairly competitive, there are also other great AIBs including ASUS TUF/ROG, MSI, Palit and many other.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-19 11:24:17'] GPU makers had that bubble because of cryptocurrency mining and now it's bursting.

I have been trimming my position as it got above $200+. I just submitted a stop sell order today to sell my remaining position. I don‚Äôt want to cut my winners short when it‚Äôs in such a strong uptrend, but Meta got expensive fast. Meta is currently sitting at a 30+ P/FCF which people forgot this is a value stock. They have little room for growth with already 3.5 billion MAUs, they‚Äôre dependent on the cyclicality of the advertising market. I can live with missing out on Nvidia and Tesla, selling Microsoft and Meta too early, but I can‚Äôt live with giving up all of my gains because I held onto a stock that was overvalued for its fundamentals. I will say that I don‚Äôt see a fundamental difference between Meta at $80 and Meta at $280.

I doubt majority of stocks going down 60+% would make a comeback.

POST_TEXT: b'Nvidia Corp., the most valuable chipmaker in the US, has begun producing a processor for China that conforms to new rules aimed at limiting that countrys access to artificial-intelligence computing.\n\nThe A800 GPU, or graphics processing unit, went into production in the third quarter and serves as an alternative to the A100 model, Nvidia said in a statement Monday. The A800 meets the US governments clear test for reduced export control and cannot be programmed to exceed it, the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker said.\n\n**Nvidia** **jarred investors** **earlier this year when it said that it was banned from selling the A100 and forthcoming H100 products to Chinese customers without special US government approval**. The change put hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue at risk. The US is concerned that the processors might be used by the military, Nvidia said in a regulatory filing in August.\n\nThe Biden administration expanded the restrictions last month, escalating tensions'

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 04:07:50'] Both. They are technically two different plays on semis. Both will have a large presence for a long time to come and both have great management. I believe Nvidia has further to fall than AMD at this point, but DCA into both is what I‚Äôm doing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 01:40:13'] Both. I‚Äôm going to reposition eventually to hold both. Both companies are well run, CEO‚Äôs have proven track record.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 06:15:05'] I have my NVDA and AMD investments at a 1-1 and I buy more of both at the same time. I think the semi-conductor industry is going to be the strongest sector for growth in the next two decades and I'm not sure which is the better play on the sector growth so I bought both.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 06:44:52'] It all depends on what you think the future will hold. AMD is more focussed on consumer and server hardware, with their CPUs, GPUs, etc. Nvidia is more focussed on graphics processing and also software with AI.My investments are also partly based on the image of the company. I can tell you that Nvidia does not have a very good image. It's greedy, anti-consumer and overall a very difficult company to work with. Even for other companies, look for recent comments from EVGA and LTT for example. AMD is more seen as an underdog, taking on the greedy companies like Nvidia and Intel. Hence, it has a much better image.I don't own any shares in the companies mentioned above. I keep my eyes on them. AMD looks more interesting to me, because of it's current valuation and imo better management.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 09:02:51'] If you're between the two, AMD.  Keep in mind they're also a processor company, and their main competitor Intel has been showing tons of weakness.  That being said, neither right now.  Tech is highly vulnerable to the high rates, though things like processors will likely be less affected than graphics cards.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 14:30:08'] I think AMD is a better buy as it takes more marketshare from Intel in Datacenter. That said I would look at others like QCOM, TXN, TSM etc. There are many chip companies at reasonable valuations.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 20:26:07'] I suggest you look elsewhere. New market cycle, new winners. But if you insist, AMD is the better choice. NVDA just keeps putting out bad news, wait until it can get back to $175. Right now you‚Äôre just trying to catch a falling knife.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 21:40:50'] AMD most definitely.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 23:05:39'] if the AMD RDNA3 can perform as well as or outperform nvidia's next offering, then you will serious change in market share. With the new chiplet design of the RDNA3 architecture, AMD should be able to improve yields and lower costs on the GPU side

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 06:44:13'] In Sanjay we trust
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 07:29:44'] AMD has a competitive advantage over Intel, they are fabless, so margins are lower and they are dependent on a third party for production.Whereas Intel has delayed their GPU a few times and require tens of billions in subsidies from the chips act and from Europe to build their new fabs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 09:34:08'] Eh really neither. Nvidia is still overvalued and AMD is ok. Way better buys in the semiconductor industry right now. I think AVGO, QCOM, and TXN are much better plays especially as we see the economy pull back and valuations come down even more.
POST: ['2023-05-15 07:39:43'] POST TITLE: b'EU approves Microsofts $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, clearing major hurdle'
POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-activision-deal-eu-approves-takeover-of-call-of-duty-maker.html\n\nEuropean Union regulators on Monday approved Microsofts proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EUs executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europes green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsofts acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giants own platforms. Activision is behind so'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 04:36:11'] Well this certainly isn't the news I was hoping to hear for MSFT. I'm sure Sony is happy after all their crying over this deal. On to the appeal...
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 08:47:37'] Nearly 300 posts and no one talking about how this is mostly good for MSFT? I mean come on the over pay for ATVI was going to be something like ex their current value. Shit is a sinking ship. Now it is more likely ATVI either goes under or sells off key assets for much less than MSFT was going to pay. It also puts nearly 70 billion back in the bank as we are headed into a potential recession. I would not be shocked to find out many in the C suite are happy to have an out from this deal.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 07:07:44'] Lol anything that they are worried "could" happen that is anti competition, Microsoft could contractually purchase from Activision and Activision could make said changes.

Sony just does not want to see CoD on Xbox Live....Only concern is around the cloud based gaming... mean look at Stadia...They had no other issues left, they had no concerns over the deal reducing competition etc for consumers...no impact concerns on console sales etc. Seems more like a provoked response to the news of msft proceeding with the deal...yesterday.Believe msft has to close the deal by end of fiscal year 2023 or atvi is owed penalties and it could be open to renegotiating terms of the deal?Will probably add to my position...at this point since I have held since early 2022...Disclaimer: Currently holding 10,400 shares of ATVI at cost basis of $80.12 (purchased Q1 2022).
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 06:14:40'] Sony's just vindictive and mad that MSFT stopped doing exclusives and port lots of said exclusive titles to PC. Sony had no choice but to follow which hurt their console sales despite the titles selling like hotcakes on PC. There's also the Xbox pass vs PS+ issue and many other stuff that had their PR spokesperson slinging shit at each other via news conference and company statement like two teenagers arguing on Twitter.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 07:36:20'] Britain is always blocking acquisitions until companies agree to give them a slice of the pie.  They are doing the same thing with Broadcom right now.  It's ridiculous. Microsoft will spend money in Britain through various means, making certain powerful people a little more money from their companies, and it will go through.   Think of Britain being the equivalent of Mexican police at road stops.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:55:16'] Microsoft should buy or heavily invest in cdpr. This deal was over priced from the get go.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:45:23'] With the Xbox doing as badly as it has against the competition, I'll be very surprised if MS don't just ditch consoles and become a publisher and/or cloud gaming platform entirely. Gamepass is a huge hit on PC and the cloud service isn't bad at all, the later just needs graphical options to turn it up a bit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 11:21:33'] Good riddance. Microsoft has acquired many ‚Äúsmaller‚Äù studios and made their games Xbox/pc exclusive. Not making CoD/Candy Crush exclusive to their consoles hardly makes up for all the other games that it has made exclusive to its platforms. I‚Äôm glad they were blocked from this, and hope that their past purchases are scrutinized, too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:53:19'] It's funny how for the past 8 years. Sony has just sat on cloud gaming with PS+ and did absolutely nothing to improve on it.Then Microsoft does it leagues better than Sony within a few years and gets called a monopoly for it even though that title really belongs to Sony.The clownery is real.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:19:25'] As an ATVI investor, I'm very disappointed by this. I had a sizable profit yesterday so I'm sad to see the stock sink.But as a gamer that believes competition is necessary in the industry, I'm very happy to hear this. Microsoft should not be allowed to buy themselves a monopoly in the gaming industry.So I'm conflicted, but I'm leaning on this being good news overall.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:31:48'] Well, well, well, it looks like Microsoft's big plan to take over the gaming world has hit a little snag! That's right folks, the British too competition regulator has put their foot down and blocked the whopping $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. Looks like they'll have to find another way to get their hands on those popular game titles. Will they try to sweet talk their way into a deal or will they simply move on to their next target? Stay tuned to find out!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:34:20'] Good. Of course more monopolization of video games will not help competition. The US regulators should have had the balls to block this acquisition.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 13:49:06'] What are the legal implications? Could they just pull out of the UK market since they are American companies?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 14:09:26'] MSFT is a hegemonic monopoly with some of the creepiest managers I‚Äôve worked with. The company produces mediocre crap like Windows and Office 365 and buys out any competition- the world would be a better place if it was broken up.

Many people, at least us older folks, have been waiting for such a game for a long time now.Although I have VERY limited expectations for Microsoft after Halo Infinite... And I've been a Halo player since the OG Xbox. It's the reason I got an OG Xbox. They need to get their shit together and make good quality games that, yes, can have microtransactions, but shouldn't be overly greedy altogether. Like Overwatch 2 selling skins for almost $20... for a single skin.And if the acquisition goes through, SONY should bring back Socom but modernize it a bit. Many people will buy it off the bat for nostalgia alone. Hell, even remaster 1 & 2.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 03:50:29'] I think they could be attractive but what worries me is that the risk profile of companies like TSM, AMD and NVDA have now completely changed.Now the US is putting restrictions on US chip exports to China we could see China getting more proactive in securing their claim to Taiwan in a move to gain some leverage against US sanctions. The more the US tries to restrict tech and semi exports to China the less China has to loose taking actions like blockading Taiwan.Realistically this status-quo will not hold and something is going to happen over the next decade, that's unlikely to be a full invasion in my opinion, but China can still apply extreme pressure on Taiwan if it's in the interest of their national security. And make no mistake, securing access to cutting-edge semis is absolutely essential to the national security of both the US and China.What worries me about buying any of these companies is that that there are now significant geopolitically tail risks here in which these companies could drop significantly more overnight. Plus arguably semi stocks like AMD, NVDA and TSM are all extremely expensive relative to the rest of the market already. The risk/reward seems skewed towards very positive returns (assuming the status-quo holds), or extremely negative (assuming geopolitically tensions increase).If you want a small position just for some exposure, then fair enough, but I wouldn't take out a big position in any of these companies unless they drop more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 22:29:09'] What does Team SoloMid have to do with NVIDIA?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 16:38:24'] The semi market is expected to enter a period of oversupply and earnings contraction. We are already seeing this happen with the most heavily cyclical companies (amd, micron, Intel, Nvidia). Demand is dropping, especially for the highest margin parts. At the same time every fab company is investing billions into new capacity that they will not need until the market comes back. If you're investing in the semi market right now, you better have a 10 year time horizon and you better pick right. Pick the wrong company and the price may never come back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 07:35:58'] Firstly, chips are cyclical - we have reached overall surplus right now. Certain areas (cars, datacentre) will still have high demand, but others (PC, gaming, crypto) are in huge surplus right now. At the moment the surplus of the latter is far greater than the demand of the former. Secondly, valuation matters - to think Nvidia should always go up because they are a great company and the forefront of the future betrays a lack of knowledge regarding valuation. Even now Nvidia has a forward p/e of 34 with a forward peg of 1.58 - it is still overvalued and this will get worse  if earnings reduce further.Finally - great company does not equal great stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 17:17:19'] The semi sector is cyclical even under normal conditions. The post-Covid glut just amplifies the typical oversupply levels. The equipment and processing companies are some of the safest long-term bets imho, but these also come with a long time horizon as others commented already. I haven't stopped adding to AMAT since 2009, and like others I lump KLAC and LRCX into a similar risk bucket. On the european side of course ASML. TPLKF is interesting at the current price, but is more exposed to the EU market (not good for growth rn). For end-user stocks I like equal parts INTC + AMD for income + growth.   I don't mess with anything based in Taiwan, geopolitical risk is too great with no added upside.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 20:45:35'] I mean if you are looking long term, semis will out perform the market. In the near term ehhhhhhh. I think the SMH could fall another 20 percent. I think you can leg into Nvidia on massive down days over the next 6 to 8 months. I think TSMC is a different animal because of the geopolitical risks. Personally I would be in ASML and Lam who will over the next decade have significant demand in the United States fab build outs.

Their auto game is weak, their AI game is limited and they can't build their own stuff. Literally nothing would happen to the world if Nvidia would dissappear tomorrow. I would see Samsung and Intel as drastically more important and these two still aren't super important compared to TSMC or ASML.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-19 17:37:48'] While I don't think China will be attacking Taiwan, at least in the near term, the US-China tension may dampen Nvidia sales. Also it may disrupt supply chain, or in a general way, dampen growth in both countries, which may lead to less chip sales all around. It's really hard to say whether China will attack Taiwan, but if they do, then it definitely isn't going to go well for the stock market as a whole. But China's not going to care if the stock market crashes.

Trades at 2x historic valuations, chip demand is falling rapidly and crypto mining fell flat on it's face. Their earnings are rapidly deteriorating. Given their historic valuations with strong growth, it is likely that it falls another 60%. 72 was the price in 2020 before the pandemic. I believe that demand will come under that. So my price target it $50.

My position in this industry is AMD, the consensus in this sub was to hold AMD and NVDA no matter what and I frankly never understood why people liked NVDA all along their run up to like 800 billion market cap. A company that makes 27 billion dollars in revenue should never be valued that high. Hell, even now at 400 billion it‚Äôs expensive as hell. I know hindsight is 2020 - Nvidia is a phenomenal company and I hope they succeed because they make a great product, but the stock on the other hand - no thank you.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 12:08:44'] Great post. This basically sums up my thoughts, but I'd add one thing, NVDA's valuation today even after this drop is still far higher than in 2018.I don't really understand why it's not fallen further. It would probably need to drop another 30-50% to start approaching something reasonable. I guess people just really love this stock. It might take a few more disappointments before investors begin to question the valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 11:42:32'] Nvidia these days are all about the data center though. Nvidia could continue to see falling gaming revenue for the next several quarters and they'd probably still be growing overall revenue as data center continues to truck along as their new main business
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 10:36:09'] From what I read Nvidia is gaining a lot of ground in data center, so perhaps that will offset the risk a bit. However, Nvidia certainly has an issue in their GPU department. They are in fact very likely to sit on a lot of stock for their new GPU series because the GPU market is going to be oversaturated with cheap GPUs (Due to crypto collapse).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 14:41:27'] No. Still too much risk for me.Aside from Crypto dependency and inability of management to project its dependency on it, the free money faucet has been turned off and the zombie companies are going away soon or shrinking dramatically. This will impact all the GPU enterprise sales.My gut says that once the dust settled, the need for GPU in the data center will be much smaller than people think. Although operations will still be profitable at the business level, the valuation of the stock will go into the toilet.

It is also the second fastest growing branch of the company. ‚ÄùGaming‚Äù (where the crypto profits belong) is not only GPU:s, it also includes cloud gaming which is a sold-out subsciption model (Geforce now) as well as various services to gaming companies, i.e optimizing games to NVDA cards. Finally we have professional visiualization, which is a small piece of the cake but one that grew over 100% YoY.(There‚Äôs also the EV business but revenue from that is neglible).TL:DR: If you believe Nvidia 2022 is some kind of derivate to the crypto market you‚Äôre delusional.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-13 09:37:25'] NVDA doesn't quite a bit more than consumer GPUs these days, and every year iit's become a smaller slice of the pie for them. I DO agree though that it's very overpriced right now though.

Revenue last quarter was 3.75 billion and up 83% yoy, while gaming/crypto was 3.67 billion and only up 31% yoyIn other words, Nvidia's future is no longer dictated by gaming or crypto bro's. But by big companies that use data centers.

People are way too bullish on NVDA (and other semi stocks) given the valuation and earnings outlook.Just have a look at people bullish on NVDA. You'll struggle to find anyone buying for the valuation. Most people will just state that "semis are the future" or say that now is a good time to buy because you might miss the bottom (FOMO).Wait for the narrative to change and the valuation to come in. If you miss the bottom, my guess is that there will be better opportunities out there anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 00:17:39'] "It's taken a dump" depends on your perspective.We can all agree that tech stock prices were massively inflated at the November 21 peak. Nvidia broke $340 and I don't even remember how high their P/E ratio was. (*edit: their P/E in Oct 2021 was 79*) The crypto market was breaking ATH's like crazy and their GPU's were selling like crazy.By October 22 it almost dropped to $100 due to revenue decreases and macroeconomic conditions but it still bounced back to $160 within a month. That's not a bad jump.My opinion:Nvidia is a great company. They will definitely grow in the coming years and I expect the price to go up long term and maybe even break it's previous ATH if the economy recovers (which it probably will at some point). However, I'm bearish short term as I can see their revenue growth declining sharply mainly due to less demand for their GPUs and ofc due to recession. My position:I'm short on Nvidia for a few days. My opinion of course could be completely false and my stop losses trigger by Thursday and I'll probably reconsider my trading skills (which are average at best). If someone has more to add or disagree, I would appreciate any input.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 23:54:14'] Sure, after recession
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 00:05:37'] Nvidia will probably come back to ATH eventually but it might take a while since a lot of the inflated price was related to crypto bullshit.

The sharp move higher looks to me a lot like panic buying from those who don't want to miss the bottom.I think they'll rally on earnings which will force the last panic buyers to capitulate and buy back in. But unless earnings are really good it will probably trend lower once everyone who's panic buying stops. And I doubt they'll be good given the macro.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 09:28:36'] NVDA will continue to sell every chip they are able to produce within the GPU segment for decades to come and the only thing that mining will tank is it will decrease the cost of the GPUs from 4x MSRP down to MSRP. NVDA wasn't able to capture the full price of the GPU market for a while now and they have been trying to combat the crypto market for a while. They only winners of the crypto boom have been the resellers. Additionally, they are branching out heavily into databases and AI and their Digital Twin program within their "Omniverse" will be amazingly profitable for them with manufacturing partners. I think their EPS continues to climb and climb rapidly over the next two decades. The question will be what multiple the market gives to their EPS and growth rate. I don't know if they will reach the same multiple they had last year unless we see more QE inflating market multiples, but I think it is going to be very easy for them to top their ATH within 5 years with a much lower multiple than before. I personally am thinking they deserve a 40-50 multiple which is a ways down from where it currently is, but the ATHs won't be that far away in time with their growth rates.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 04:59:01'] Even with mining dead, Nvidia has the only GPU and tools that companies use for any serious ML and AI in general projects. The cloud providers will eat up a lot of the capacity that became available, just that they will get much better margins than what NVDA used to sell to retail.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 08:14:24'] nvidia in the near term will suffer. Mining is moving away from PoW to PoS. Their card sales in the 'gaming/mining' division will fall substantially.But nvidia still has a growing market for data center applications. They are in the process of diversifying more into AI/car applications. AI is a tricky beast, because what constitutes bleeding edge AI changes so quickly.Will it go back to ATH? Not any time soon IMO. We may see north of 200 after the end of  the tightening cycle, and we go back to easy money, but that will be in 5 years or more.What happens to the stock depends on the growth story that nvidia puts forward. Can nvidia justify having an inflated P/E? Right now, no.I say this as someone holding 100 shares of nvidia at 240$. I would not have paid 240$ for nvidia; it was a gamble on a put that bit me when Brainard came out overly hawkish early in the year, and the stock tanked over 60$ in a day. Due to some life issues I was unable to buy back the put before it was assigned. I have been contemplating selling since, but kept selling CCs on the rallies. I am still thinking of selling, since the downside potential of nvidia right now could easily put it under 100$/share for years.Short term -> Downside to less than 100$/share.Medium term -> May go back up after easy money cycle resumes. May even see north of 200$ again. Long term -> Depends on the decisions nvidia makes. Hard to guess. But Jensen Huang is a smart guy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 19:41:37'] I‚Äôm a software engineer currently on a machine learning team at a large company. I‚Äôve spent the last year learning about machine learning/AI as a whole, and even blockchain tech. I‚Äôm not an expert, but I don‚Äôt think I need to be an expert. Peter Lynch would tell us we don‚Äôt need to be experts. We just need to be able to read the room and pay attention. Any machine learning worth its salt is going to REQUIRE a GPU. Period. Nvidia is way ahead of AMD for library support for people like me to be able to use Nvidia GPUs to train models and so forth. Support for AMD GPUs for what me and people like me do is still lacking. I was hoping by now the OpenCL library would have caught up to Nvidia‚Äôa CUDA library, but I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs really any catching up to CUDA at this point. It‚Äôs like Windows. Generally it can be said that Linux and macOS (both derivatives of Unix/FreeBSD) are superior to Windows. But Windows is Windows. There‚Äôs so much software written for it, there are so many people who know how to use it, it‚Äôs so common that it‚Äôs going to be very hard for the world to break free from it. Those who are familiar with history know that people have been predicting the rise of Linux since the 90s and it hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Sure we got Microsoft to port C#/.NET to Linux and come out with cross-platform tools like VS Code, but their WSL is *clearly* them saying ‚Äúwe recognize some people need Linux for X Y Z, and since Windows is clearly the superior OS, we have added a Linux VM to Windows! Enjoy!‚Äù People confuse that for ‚ÄúLinux-based Windows incoming‚Äù but it‚Äôs actually the opposite. They are committing to the Windows NT kernel. There probably won‚Äôt be a Linux-based Windows for a very long time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 09:33:43'] Crypto is actually a less impactful segment to Nvidia‚Äôs revenue stream than it was just a few years ago. Crypto makes up approximately 2% of their current revenue. They‚Äôve been shifting focus heavily toward data center and AI. Gaming is still a large contributor to their revenue stream, and will continue to be meaningful, but you can‚Äôt use current gaming revenue figures interchangeably with crypto. People here saying crypto is the reason Nvidia is going down are entitled to their opinion, but I think that‚Äôs misleading. Sure, crypto is a part of it because it impacts investor sentiment (as evident by this thread), but a bigger part of it is macro supply chain issues, China‚Äôs restricted economy, higher interest rates and yields, and concerns of a recessionary environment weighing on the chip sector.TL;DR Crypto only makes up 2% of Nvidia‚Äôs current revenue; making dramatic price target calls on Nvidia‚Äôs crypto revenue is probably the wrong way to look at it. Cheers to everyone and good luck if you own shares! (I do and will be rooting for it alongside those here who hold NVDA)

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 16:58:29'] Gaming (includes crypto) isn't their primary market anymore, as it was overtaken by Data Center.They raked in 3.6bn from gaming, up from 2.7bn, for a 31% YoY rate.Yet they raked in 3.7bn from data center, up from 2bn, for a 83% YoY rate.The data center business has been kind to all, even Intel.This type of business is more reliable and future-proof than crypto mining. People will still buy GPUs for what they were meant for, gaming, even if the demand is a lot less without crypto
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 11:51:03'] Lets be real there likely will be more painful times for Nvidia ahead. Gaming graphic card is a luxury goods, people are not going to shell out $1-2k for graphic cards during a recession when even 1060 can still run just about every game on the market. It has become a status symbol at this point
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 06:01:34'] Regardless of Nvidia's graphic card other uses, the driving factor behind it's stock price has been it's sale due to crypto mining. With the cost to mine significantly more expensive then it's actual value, mining will fall off. Less sales means the price will come down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 08:35:48'] Honestly they will get fucked if they do not make a special mining rig and try to get friendly with miners.Although Ethereum moves away, there are other chains that they could take on, Like Kadena which requires special hardware,ASIC, which they could take advantage of
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 09:00:49'] Gamer‚Äôs have been salivating for an upgrade, and most know that the cards used 24/7 for mining will be unreliable and not worth buying for gaming. The cards are still gonna fly off the shelves because there is still way more demand than they can produce. Then consider the ML and AI market which will become a trillion-dollar industry within the next decade, and Nvidia makes the cards that power these algorithms. It will be bumpy for the next few months, but I‚Äôm confident that by 2030 people will look back at the current ATH wishing they could have bought then.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 10:04:39'] I mean there was prolly a dude that thought nvidia was never gonna reach ath before crypto was known as well.

They are an integral part of modern life. They aren't going under. They may not recover share price quickly, but it is much more likely they pass those ATHs than not. Stocks go up over time as a general rule
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 15:40:19'] I‚Äôm sorry but you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about and have done no due diligence on nvidia as a company if you think they‚Äôll never see ath again.

I see this moronic argument so many times on this platform again and again or how ‚Äúsome company‚Äôs in dotcom crash never reached those levels again.‚Äù Yeah the dogshit ones didn‚Äôt and rightfully so.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 11:35:34'] As a miner myself, it is not dead and many miners are buying GPUs at these discounts, there are other coins that utilize proof of work that are rising to prominence.Also PC gaming, at home graphic designing and video editing, etc are all growing and all require GPU power.Not to mention Nvidia‚Äôs AI stuff..Any chip manufacturer is a sure bet imo

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 19:32:52'] Nvidia's customers will become the gamers again. But Crypto will probably bounce back. This is a temporary situation, in all likelihood. This just means gamers won't be out in the cold anymore - for now. I'd imagine there will be new regulations put in place to try and alter the Crypto world - anybody's guess how that will play out. My own humble opinion is that Crypto is going to change the world if it continues on the way it has so far. I would worry about the USA's hegemony, not Nvidia. The Fed won't be able to manipulate markets the same way anymore if the dollar stops being the world's reserve currency. That's why little countries like El Salvador are betting heavily on Crypto.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 04:10:49'] In short term for sure but I wouldn't hedge my bets that mining is dead. It's more then likely just going to move to other coins and while those coins aren't profitable right now it's likely going to change in the future. If you've regulations coming in you're likely going to see an uptrend in privacy coins. There's nothing backing the prices of most Crypto. People are greedy and people chase profits. Right now I'm running mining on phones that I've directly powered into a 5v the CPUs on my phone's Vs electronic costs are running at profit. If Nvidia bring out GPUs that pull coins into profitability people will buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 09:12:50'] Anegdote - when I was searching for 3080 on launch guy working in PC parts shop told me everything went for mining rigs- simply miners were purchasing large quantities at high prices.If mining market remains like today, all those GPU will flood gaming one. Even gamers were buying 3000 to game and pay it with mining. A year ago there was no ps5 in shops, no Xbox series x, no GPU at reasonable price. By the end of the year most likely market will be oversaturated with Nvidia 3000, pst and box widely available. There is miniscule number of gamers that will give 1k for 4000 when they won't be able to sell 3000 for fraction of what they paid,  just to use it for gaming.Nvidia is entering rough time if mining remains unprofitable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 08:21:03'] lower demand.  I imagine the old machines can be used for games. Supercomputers.  I imagine Nvda will have lower revenue growth for a couple years not able to beat past sales. But there may be other uses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 08:33:33'] As long as there will be demand for better graphics and AI, NVIDIA certainly has a healthy future. Whether it will ATH or not depends entirely on how they position themselves in the AI space
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 09:58:52'] I think they're a solid company that is on a good path as a business, but short term yeah the stock's probably going way down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 12:36:57'] There will always be proof of work coins to mine imo
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-03 13:19:02'] I‚Äôm not in the industry but from what I hear if ETH isn‚Äôt the most profitable coin to mine anymore the miners will transition to the next profitable one. I assume that would use the same equipment so demand would probably still be there, but it will be a decline rather than if ETH would remain PoW.

It's taking more share of advertising dollars as more ad spent shifts to streaming TV away from linear TV + there is extra upside from mobile ads based on Apple's digital privacy changes. When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear.

POST_TEXT: b'Link to article from [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/6/23059930/nvidia-sec-charges-fine-settlement-gaming-gpu-crypto-mining)\n\n"Nvidia will pay $5.5 million to settle charges that it unlawfully obscured how many of its graphics cards were sold to cryptocurrency miners. The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to gaming, hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isnt admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\n\nThe charges stem from Nvidias fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line spec'

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 08:47:49'] The fine amount is meaningless. One might also think that the reasons behind the fine are meaningful in that the SEC is openly saying, "Hey, you're not being forthright about the fact that the crypto boom is a key to your recent growth, which could matter if it goes bust." But one would probably be wrong, because warnings like these typically go unheeded, at least until the damage is done.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 06:51:12'] Oh cmon, anybody with a tiny bit of intelligence would know their growth was based on miners. How can they  claim they hid anything? Everything was out in the open and everyone knew the shortages and nasty prices were due to crypto.5mil is peanuts for them, but you shouldnt be able to claim ignorance because you put your fingers in your ears and refuse to  hear the news everyday.

If eth no longer requires mining and miners begin selling all their cards back to the open market, at presumably discounted prices, what effect will this have on sales for nvidia and how much would this impact affect the company overall?

NIO is completing NeoPark this year with One Million EV CapacityNow each of those NIO EVs uses 4 NVDA Orin Chips. For 500,000 EVs that would be 2 Million Chips.If each Orin Chip brings NVDA $400 (Have NO idea if this is even close to being correct)That would bring NVDA $800 Million just from NIO compared to NVDA current annual Automotive business of $566 MillionSo that would be huge.

This will be coming to an end soon as Ethereum is switching to a staking model. future growth will not come from crypto in the near to mid term as the exodus from ethereum will have a negative impact on gpu demand. This has already started.  Future growth should  come from gamers who skipped the 3000 series, render farms, datacenters buying gpu compute and general ai gpu requirements.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 10:59:01'] MehI probably won't ever buy it, but NVDA probably isn't interesting until the low $130's as that's the big area of demand. It's likely gonna hit at some point later this summer because Google hit a similar area of demand (and it took off faster in 2021, so NVDA is likely behind on this).Disclosure: I hold AVGO/AMAT but I'm thinking about making it AVGO and ASML.I've said so elsewhere and will say it again...I think a large reason why the inverse Cramer stuff has worked extra well this year is because this is the worst that the Nasdaq has been since 2008 (even if it's nowhere near that on a percentage basis) and a lot of what he likes is large cap tech. Yes, there's other stuff, but large cap tech is a lot of it.So, you pretty much could've just gone SQQQ and done great. I did it once on a feeling and sold too early because frankly, the fact there was multiple -100 + days was a major shock for me (which tbh, I THINK that's gone until July because quarterly OPEX is hedged up big time, and I think some of what was seen in May was major fund liquidations).

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 03:59:23'] The problem with NVDA is that it trades largely on investor optimism so anything that could derail the sentiment story around NVDA should be seen as a risk to the near-term valuation.I think NVDA is a great company and I really want to own it, but at this point in time it's priced extremely aggressively even relative to its own historical valuations. Given the market we're in I'm seeing lots of reasons why investors might want to be a little more cautious on the near-term outlook for NVDA, but so far this hasn't been fully reflected in the stock price. It's possible NVDA will keep going up, but it could also easily fall 50% from here should we see a larger shift in investor sentiment.It's probably a great company to own long-term, but at the current valuation you risk being underwater for a year or two before seeing any returns.

POST_TEXT: b'Hi! Rn I have some money to invest. And I found 2 companies intel and nvidia ( similar companies doesnt fit because my broker dont offer them) anyway which stock I should choose. Im not very strong in this field but looking from technical point intel looks cheaper.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 09:07:04'] They are not really similar. Nvidia designs chips for  GPUs and for AI applications. They recently entered the data center market. Nvidia doesn‚Äôt make their own chips, but have a contract with TSMC to make chips for them. Intel designs and makes chips for clients (laptops and desktops), data centers and recently entered the discrete GPU market. They are also expanding into the foundry business, meaning they will make chips for other customers. They also own Mobileye, which is expected to IPO this year or next. Before you buy either of the two stocks, I would advise that you learn more about the companies, and their financial performance. Intel for example, has been a dividend stock for a while, but they are going to have a negative cash flow for the first time in decades to fund their foundry business. As a result, the stock may not do well for the next couple of years till Wall Street sees tangible results.Nvidia on the other hand has been growing very quickly the last couple of years, but there are strong signs that the music is about to stop with an oversupply of GPUs and chips in general. The problem with growth stocks is that the multiple completely collapses once the growth slows down, so there is a significant risk of that in the short to medium term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 16:03:46'] Kind of a no brainer imo. NVDA is driving the future, INTC is "trying" to catch up. From a technical perspective, INTC will test the 42-45 range, but with the years of supply accumulated above that area, they will have a hard time clearing much above that range. I would avoid INTC, and start to DCA into NVDA for the long term (5-10yrs). Cheers, and best of luck either way.

That is very high for a tech company with a solid business model AND room to grow.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 11:35:42'] Like others have said they are similar, NVIDIA might stay down with eth switching to PoS if it ever happens, or the unlikely event the crypto implodes further. However NVIDIA GPUs are also in high demand for machine learning and AI.&#x200B;Intel has been around forever, since 1968, and is the largest CPU vendor, and involved in another of other chip type stuff. Intel is  likely a little safer/more stable bet than NVIDIA, but long term they both have a strong upside, NVIDIA will likely be a bit more volatile, but maybe that risk equates to a potential higher upside.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 15:49:02'] One thing to note is that with the fall of crypto is a reduced need for gpu power given that crypto mining is down. That means nvidia took a hit. Of course they aren‚Äôt a one trick pony.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 15:56:54'] Intel is cheaper and it pays a 4% dividend. PE ratio is very low, around 6 right now. That's a value stock for sure. Nvidia is high growth, no dividend (well .11%, so very low) with a PE around 40. Either one would probably be a good buy, especially with a long term time horizon. But something to consider...chips are very cyclical and don't necessarily do great in a recession environment. Plus, PC sales may be slowing tremendously. This may already be priced into both of these stocks. I would guess that there won't be much upside to either of them for a bit, at least through earnings, but at least with Intel you get paid 4% to wait. AMD is really taking market share from Intel though so there is some risk that Intel continues to lose market share. Assuming you can, I'd also look into Taiwan Semis.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-13 03:22:50'] IMO, you are going to see pressure on chip companies in the medium to distant future.More and more the chips will be designed by the big tech companies.

Google is in production with the fourth generation and working on the fifith."Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records ‚Äî And We Aren't Surprised"https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-recordsGoogle is now also doing their own chips for mobile phones with the Pixel.  They will start doing their own for tablet and computers is the speculation.Amazon is now doing their own for their cloud with their own ARM chip.Tesla is now using their own chips in the cars.   I would expect the same from Waymo.The world has changed.  In 2022 the big tech companies are so big there is a viable ROI on designing your own chips.Key is ASML and TSMC as well as Samsung.   These companies are making it so you can easily fabricate a chip.I do not see this trend changing.  I would expect it to continue.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 15:42:21'] I really couldn't care less about crypto stuff, but if one crypto mining company closing up shop is enough to have a material impact on Nvidia, there are some serious risks in their business model that people need to talk about more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 20:00:25'] I remember about January asking in one of these subs why Nvidia is so popular over competition. The overwhelming answer was crypto mining, which I didn't realize was such a big part of their business. Based off that, I'd say proof-of-work/stake (I can't remember) is going to hurt them quite a bit. I think they are heavily reliant on that niche market and spent a ton developing the tech. It will be interesting to watch it play out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 06:21:39'] To many people overhype crypto , crypto ain‚Äôt shit, all those scam alt coins and hacks stealing billions, so much for ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù . It‚Äôs like every week there‚Äôs some negative crypto news
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 01:22:28'] First off Ethereum mining is finished so everybody who bought GPU(s) or ASICs to mine are in a dilemma whether they should sell their hardware or look for another coin which can be mined profitable.Imagine regular gamers buying multiple graphics cards (sometimes dozens) just to mine because they heard it it's profitable, and this was from 2020 until now. And imagine big mining farms where you can find hundreds or even thousands of graphics cards, this was from \~2017. You can google it, just take a look at some of those pictures.About 95% of the mining-power (hashrate) was mining Ethereum so all the other GPU-minable coins combined can't "absorb" all of this calculation-capacity so these other coins became unprofitable overnight for most of these people (unless they have very-very cheap or free electricity).So back to the article it's not just this mining pool but about 80+% of all miners (based on calculations) will probably look to sell their hardware on the second hand market in the coming weeks/months and all this worth about between $5B and $15B, it depends on who you ask, it's between 10 and 30 million graphics cards.Also Nvidia inventory is full of new RTX 30xx cards right now that's why they choose to introduce in October only the high-end RTX 40xx cards first because they're much faster than the fastest 30xx card the 3090 Ti so they don't have in-house competition.The prices of second hand market will push down the new market prices because that's how supply and demand works, if I buy a used card because it's really cheap then I'm no longer looking for a new card. So I'm pretty sure their gaming revenue and margin will go even lower in this year.I'm not sure how this will affect the stock price because in one hand the Ethereum Merge is very old news, whoever is serious about looking after their investment should've known about this for months. On the other hand Jensen Huang always downplayed the effect of mining on the company.They expect the revenue to drop to $5.9B in Q3 (down from $6.7B in Q2), they told us that their inventory levels are high so this is already priced in. But they didn't mention anything about the second hand market after the Ethereum Merge in their earnings call.I would say it's not impossible that we will see something like what we've seen in 2018, maybe in a smaller scale because the stock is already down 60% from the top.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 18:27:35'] For those individuals not down the crypto-rabbit hole like I am, 1. the current ‚Äúplan‚Äù is for miners to fork Ethereum to keep a Proof of Work chain going.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 17:10:43'] Sell half and buy back slowly
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 15:31:52'] Locking in profits is good strategy.  You never know what could happen in 10 years, anyone remember IBM or Blackberry?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 14:01:43'] That is the big gamble. If you've got 10 years, I'd just leave it be.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 17:11:12'] That is fine.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 16:23:40'] I have a rather basic question : suppose I had some stocks which say double . Then when I sell them to put into Vti do I have to pay tax on my gains ? And thus at the end of the year , will have to sell a portion of the vti to cover taxes ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 17:53:18'] Take the win and move on. Stocks rarely survive 10 years in public markets
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 17:59:52'] Depends. Since it sounds like non-retirement, take your gains as you please and leave the original investment. If you decide to wait, yes there‚Äôs a good chance that stocks like those will grow, but you‚Äôll have even bigger tax obligations. Determine a year that you feel good about taking a tax hit and potentially increasing your annual income.Also; what was your original plan with these stocks? Was your plan to make short plays or are your eyes just getting big? If you have a sound plan that doesn‚Äôt involve selling now, stick with it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 19:43:28'] Sell all and put it in an index fund, then leave it. Market cap weighted funds will still give you significant exposure to these companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 04:50:06'] If you're holding for a decade plus, the index is a good choice. I only actively trade individual stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 05:43:13'] I'm still holding onto my Google, apple, and Microsoft despite the gains. My investing thesis hasn't changed and I don't think they are absurdly valued. All of the best investors encourage having a high school threshold for selling.I might take some Nvidia profits if I had it because it just seems absurd.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:37:21'] I was in the same position. I think its smart to hold great companies and not worry about their year to year performance. So I am still holding Google, MsFt, Meta. However I did sell out of Nvidia. I still love the company and will buy back in if it drops but I considered it way to over priced.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 10:32:38'] I cashed out of NVDA last week at $400. I love the company long term but their cash flow is many years away from justifying its share price. I wouldn‚Äôt mess with rest. They‚Äôre running hot, but not like NVDA lol.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 15:17:23'] People usually buy more mega cap stocks over etfs which is stupid because etfs are already heavy on mega cap stocks, definitely it's better take profit if a mega cap stock is trades higher than usual because with single stock picks beaten quality stocks should be bought like meta, currently mega caps will have the same movement potential with much higher risk than etfs, totally pointless.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 10:17:01'] Who are  winners and losers in this?  Nividia and Softbank may be the losers.  I would say companies like Apple would be a winner as having ARM as an independent company is better than having it as a part of a chip maker.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 19:15:53'] ARM would have meant a lot of share dilution, the deal was better when it was made but NVDA went up so much that the deal got a lot more expensive for shareholders. So its really not the worst that it fails. NVDA will be doing great anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 06:59:33'] How big a deal is this for NVDA future revenue , was arm just another chip maker they where going to acquire or was there more at stake here they lost?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 06:54:35'] I too call being rejected preparing to abandon the relationship.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 07:12:32'] Did anyone really think that this deal would go through?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 14:26:49'] They may have dodged a bullet. ARM in itself is probably just a temporary stopgap. The only reason we use it is because our batteries still suck. Otherwise, you simply cant compete with the breadth of software already available on x86/AMD64. With batteries improving rapidly, we might reach the point where high efficiency wont matter and everyone will look for horsepower again.We have seen all this before even within x86 generations. We have also see it in other sectors. When energy is expensive, people switch to efficient. When energy is cheap, they no longer care and just look for best performance.So im thinking that depending on how battery tech advances the next 5 years, its possible ARM goes out the window, and ironically, WinTel makes a comeback on.... smartphones.... wouldnt that be something? Id laugh.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 14:49:17'] This is a really big setback for NVIDIA. ARM more or less has a monopoly on the design of mobile processors. You can't build any device now almost that doesn't have an ARM processer in it, being cellphone, car, smart fridge, etc.Buying ARM at $40B or even $80B would have been a steal.I would be buying Softbank now, if it wasn't for that they will tank. Maybe I will buy Softbank later this year, as prices come down more.Disclaimer: I currently own $LCID (big losses, almost no sales, $60B market cap, and competition is coming out with self-driving cars and solid-state batteries) puts and cash.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 12:22:44'] You had me in the first bit, prior to the last word.  Abandoning a $40B division would be huge news.  Abandoning a $40B bid (which should be for something worth a vaguely similar level) is smaller (but still quite reportable) news.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 23:33:57'] ARM acquired by SoftBank didn‚Äôt make sense at all in the first place. Don‚Äôt know why NVIDIA tried to acquire ARM when ARM is literally the core of all trillion dollar companies. May be SoftBank will spin off ARM again as an independent company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 23:41:39'] I don't know if this is considered bad news since people have speculated this for a long time.However, if this is indeed bad news, this is the perfect time to break it to the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 14:27:19'] They're all high valuation high growth. Those valuations will all compress, so which one will have the earnings growth to outpace the valuation compression.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 12:01:26'] AMD has the most potential for growth out of the 3. This will be the first quarter with Xilinx included in earnings and they just bought pensando.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 15:41:12'] All 3 are good. AMD has the best growth potential for the next few years. NVDA is great too but is already priced in. AAPL is safe but will grow slower than the other 2 chip stocks
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 12:48:57'] Alternative: Buy a semiconductor ETF (SMH? SOXX?), and buy AAPL individually.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 13:57:17'] Looking for better growth potential? Go with AMD   Looking for a safer, less volatile option? Go with Apple   Looking for something in between these two? Go with NVIDIA   My personal preference is AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 15:04:55'] Intel for dividends. AMD maybe got the biggest chance at increasing revenue by robbing more corporate market shares off Intel in the short term. Anyway with a now steadier chip supply, start of the rise of arm chips for corporate servers, new chips factories coming up everywhere in the next two years.. I'd be very careful in investing in nvda or amd given their current p/e. They'll still make profits, the question mark is on how much. I see Apple as a safer bet because of its loyal customers and appeal as a "fashion" brand rather than just tech.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 14:04:07'] AMD I think has the most upside. AAPL is the safest. NVIDIA is great but I think it needs to come down more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 18:14:30'] Idk why when NVDA is brought up, most people only argue from the commercial stand point of their business and tend to not mention their enterprise endeavours. I'm quite interested in know how big of role their enterprise branch is. Anyone has insights to this? I mean, their quadro lineup is not exactly cheap and most servers requires more GPU than what a typical consumer grade computer would have. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure they have dwellings / collaborations specifically in the enterprise sectors.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 21:14:12'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 08:40:38'] Like how you stated the 3 biggest bubbles if there was a crash
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 09:35:40'] As someone who‚Äôs been watching all 3 recently, here‚Äôs my take on what will happen.1. Apple - at a near ATH (less than 7% off), which is similar to S&P500. Heck, they were at ATH just last week. I find the growth in Apple to be in short spurts. It tends to boom up, then trade sideways for a while. I think we‚Äôre gonna go sideways for a bit with Apple, especially with general market weakness. While Apple is a great company, its had a hell of a boom recently (tripled in value over last 2 years). Long term, it will go up I‚Äôm sure. But I might trade sideways for a while before then.2. NVDA - Quite a bit off their ATH currently, but also not quite at their bottom I don‚Äôt think. I could see them going to 200, maybe a bit less with poor market stability. Their P/E is still incredibly optimistic compared to the rest of the field. In order to maintain their P/E over the next two years, they‚Äôd grow 50%. It holds a high PEG value too, (2.92), meaning it is relatively overvalued even accounting for its growth. I think it definitely can go up, but I think it‚Äôs actually pretty fairly priced where it‚Äôs at. 3. AMD has taken a brutal beating recently. It‚Äôs about 60% off it‚Äôs ATH. It would need to increase 50% y/y to match its projected growth by 2024. Its PEG ratio is under 1, indicating it‚Äôs a buy. AMD is currently sitting at a 6 month low. It hasn‚Äôt been valued lower than 100 per share since July 2021. Since this valuation, which is before Semi‚Äôs really took off in Q4, AMD has acquired Xilinx, acquired another (albeit smaller) company, announced a 8bil buyback while completing nearly 3 billion of their last announcement. What this tells me, is that AMD is so confident in their company and they think they‚Äôre undervalued, so they‚Äôre buying up their own stock with free cash to potentially resell later or improve valuation.Of these 3, the greatest short play is AMD. It has the highest opportunity to increase 50% y/y. Next would be NVIDIA. Ideal growth at 25% y/y. Finally Apple, which I would be impressed with a growth rate of 15% y/y.I think the riskiest play, at this point, is actually NVIDIA. They‚Äôve been really overvalued for a long time, despite their market dominance. With greater market competition, they may struggle in the years to come. AMD is in the same boat, but just more undervalued across the board, and therefore has less room to fall. Apple is by far the safest play, I would say. But that doesn‚Äôt mean a 20% drop couldn‚Äôt happen over the next few months.Disclaimer: I hold substantial amounts of all three stocks listed for close to two years now. My biggest position is in AMD, for the reasons I listed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 18:04:16'] NVDA has an increasing AI play that is pretty cool. Take a look into their current projects.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 13:14:11'] Id say nvidia. I dont own any. But as a gamer, i can tell you there's a lot of hype around grapic card prices coming to an end. That can only mean a future of more sales...  jmho.  Not expert stock advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 17:44:14'] Apple no doubt!
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 19:46:24'] I am always surprised nobody mentions here that semiconductors are historically a very cyclical sector. If that still holds true, there will be an oversupply somewhere down the road, leading to crashing product prices -- which would wreak havoc on semiconductor stocks trading at high multiples.Maybe this time it's different. Or maybe reddit is blinded by confirmation and recency bias. I dunno, really.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 14:45:08'] AMD
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 00:46:15'] I own NVDA and AAPL both. NVDA still has high price but since I keep selling covered call+put options my real cost down a lot. The same to AAPL, down the cost. If a person can only buy one stock that must be AAPL. How could one build his/her portfolio without the greatest company? AAPL has stable ecosystem of products, huge growth potential of service business which would increase gross margin. Its free cash flow yield keeps growing and ROE is 140% in 2021 whereas Samsun has only 17%
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 07:25:04'] I think AAPL is the most overvalued. Sure they're growing rapidly right now but their products are are expensive and discretionary, so if the economy slows they will suffer the most. Also heavy exposure to potential Taiwan conflicts. Everyone thinks AAPL is super safe, and that alone makes it unsafe.  AMD is the best price for its growth in my opinion. But it's at 40 p/e... you might get it at 30 p/e in the next 12 months. Still AMD has a lot of exposure to consumer PC markets. It's more discretionary than NVDA.  NVDA is just too expensive, in my opinion because of the metaverse hype, but we are seeing the valuations contract. Maybe you get it at 40 p/e soon.

NVDA great verticals, sitting on a ton of cash, I can see them making a big move since ARM deal didn't go through, they will definitely buy something else. If they raise cash from creation of new shares (rumor currently) I believe this is confirmation that they will do something huge with the money. Sure they are trading at a high multiple but winners are expensive and NVDA is the industry leader.AAPL the obvious question is how much bigger can they get but great products and could they be developing software for vehicles and partner with an auto maker? Probably the safest out of these 3.

Ride it up to $35+ then sell then buy AMD which should be below $95. SOXL isn‚Äôt a buy and hold but but can salvage a portfolio quickly during a recovery like we just had.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 02:23:23'] Personally I would say all three are overvalued at current prices (Nvidia>Apple>AMD). I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll necessarily lose money on any of these long term but it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll beat the index.For those who can justify the high multiples (especially Nvidia) what growth rates are you expecting?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 19:52:14'] Personally I'd say not apple, they have a lot of shitty business practices and laws in the EU and in other areas are taking aim at them. Nvidia is an extremely powerful and diverse company. AMD is a very powerful company but only at CPUs and GPUs. Personally I'd recommend Intel, they're a direct competitor to AMD, their products hold a similar quality and price point, and they pay out a dividends while still having decent growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 21:43:09'] I haven't read other comments, but AMD for sure. EXTREMELY undervalued still at 100. They are better than Intel and nVidia, PC gamers/builds are on the rise. I bought a decent amount at 75 and Rick I bought more then. But have bought more at 95. They are still extremely undervalued at 100 IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:55:23'] Google is in no way shape or form behind in AI. The Google search engine has been using natural language processing to rank results for years now. This is why backlinks are less important than they used to be. There was a time when backlinks were the currency by which authority was generated, but since probably 2015, the Google spider has been able to make meaning out of text directly and rank it accordingly.OpenAI launched a UI to a natural language processing engine, much of which was built on the research Google has been doing for a decade and open sourcing. To wit, without Google, OpenAI simply would not exist.

Look which search engine had the MOST growth in the last month.https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-shareBTW, I think it is now pretty obvious that Fortune 500 companies are going to adopt LLMs.  They take massive resources to train and to run in production.   Google was so smart to develop the TPUs 8 years ago.  Now with the fourth generation in production and soon to release the fifth.   The TPUs allows Google to have higher margins in the training and running the LLM models.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 03:56:03'] dumb move
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 23:07:38'] You should recognise that although Google represents itself as a technology company, by revenue, it's an advertising company. About 80% of its revenue. I can't find what percentage of that is from paid search, but I imagine it's quite large.The search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.Now go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.Google can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.So I think google is going to face serious headwinds in terms of their core revenue drivers. They will survive, but its going to be painful. They got complacent. The tortoise overtook the hare while he was resting on his laurels.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 15:53:51'] not bullish or bearish on google, more concerned after learning how disproportionate a 1 percent drop in their search market share hits their earnings, and goog sitting at roughly 95% percent market share leaves a lot of risk to downside if they mess up even a little bit on ai search

Again, are you able to stomach 25%+ declines of more in some years? Or could there be a case of you needing the money and not being able to watch it negative since you started investing.3) Nobody's asking how much can you afford to invest, whether it is a one time investment, a monthly one and whether you have intentions to make huge personal investments in the next years (e.g. buying a house or starting a business).

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:04:25'] I'm seeing many already established, often outlandishly high P/E companies here that would have been a good investment some time ago.Full Disclosure: I own shares in the company that I will now briefly talk about. I consider it a great investment right now (I'm not responsible for any losses).Westlake Chemical Corporation (WCC). First let us talk about past performance and financial metrics. WCC over the last 10 years has shown a 10 year median return of ROE of 21,4% and a ROIC of 14,5%. When one considered the ROIC it seems like a company that seems rather cyclical and is rather sensitive to major crisis (ROIC 2008=-1.67% and 2019/20= +3-4%). That 14,5% is with the years of corona included. So the upside is a generally high ROIC, but a high variance of the ROIC. The company has been profitable 19 out of the last 20 years (with the year of unprofitability being the banking crisis in 2008). So the return side looks solid, even if I'd rather have less cyclicality.Let us consider the growth. The story here is similar. 10-year average growth rates are 16% for revenue, 19,7% on assets, 26,2% of FCF and 19,7% for EPS. It is nice that ROE is mostly greater than the growth rates, indicating that the growth is sustainable. This growth also seems not to driven only by aquisitions and the issuence of debt. There have been two aquisitions made and in parts financed by debt in the last 10 years and the business is far from overly leveraged ($4.88B debt and $2.23B cash on hand with a marketcap of $15.1B). The 10 year median margins I do not know enough about to compare to industry standarts, but they seem high with Gross profit margin of 24,4%, EBIT 18.1% and FCF-margin of 11.1%. Maybe someone more knowledgeable about the industry can weigh in here. The company is also buying back shares, even if not at an emormous rate.And all of that for a P/E of 6,8.To me that seems like a conservatively run company, by a management that makes sensible and careful business decisions, with good profitability and good growth and low debt. For me this is a "no-brainer" stock, although it isn't perfect, which is why i have just recently bought the stock and gave it significant weight in my portfolio. A personal problem is that I do not know enough about plastics and coatings, which is their business, but every other metric checks out for me.I would be happy to hear any criticism of the company, as it then might improve how I look at companies in the future. Good luck and thanks :)

When Meta was <$100 I would have said Meta. I liked BABA at $85,DR Horton at $60, Micron at $50, BAM & BC at $30, Salesforce at $135, and Goog at $85. If I had to buy something right now, it would probably be Whirlpool. I know boring but 5% dividend that looks very safe, aggressively buying back shares, probably the best value home appliance company with a good reputation, and trading at a fcf of 8x and a 5 year PE of 9x. I recently had to purchase a washer & dryer so my deep dive on home appliances put Whirlpool on my radar.

They are opening new plants/factories in multiple locations all over the world. Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. In comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That‚Äôs per company. There isn‚Äôt a company that can produce at Tesla‚Äôs speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it‚Äôs going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That‚Äôs 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that‚Äôs a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. I know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. Tesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years. That‚Äôs 14 years. That‚Äôs millions of teslas and counting on the road for years to come before any other company comes even close to producing cars as fast as Tesla. By the time the other companies catch up it will be too late. Tesla is KING!!!!

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 23:45:29'] I like Roku, it's already up 60% this year and has more room to go. It's taking more share of advertising dollars as more ad spent shifts to streaming TV away from linear TV + there is extra upside from mobile ads based on Apple's digital privacy changes. When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:44:49'] Nothing matters if guidance is weak. Markets like to be forward looking.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:47:22'] With high valuation you better put up optimistic guidance.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:55:02'] Considering it was up 5.1% before close a net of -1.7% isn't that bad.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:42:30'] Guidance for next quarter was below expectations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:41:45'] Overvalued. That's it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 20:59:51'] The stock market is the only market where people see a sale and run to the exit - WB.Don't buy or sale NVDA because its up or down this week. If you like the long-term prospects of the company, buy a little every week or month over several years, and hold until your view of the company changes.If you want to trade the stock, do it on momentum, not fundamentals. Skilled traders can make a good profit, but most people just confuse their luck with skill.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 23:50:36'] Guidance was lowered. Do you buy the earnings today or the earnings in the future? Right. That's why it went down, because the market is pricing in lower growth + fed pressure.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 18:15:08'] People just need to give it up. Everything is coming down no matter what they produce right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 18:13:51'] Not past sales. Poor outlook because of China lock down in the immediate future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 17:49:11'] Yes q2 guidance was supposed to be $8.44B instead they said $8.04B which is light. Means 2022 total year EPS won‚Äôt be net. 44 PE valuation no longer valid.Just to let you know the whole CNBC & Analysts scams are to say, no sp500 earnings are going to be lower but they won‚Äôt. So there is this whole forward PE lie. The PE is actually much higher with the lower guidance. They do this to rationalize that Q3 and Q4 companies can make it up. Also the excuse gives their investment banks cover to unload saying forward PE lie is low. When Q3 earnings can‚Äôt make up the difference then will come the bloodbath.So just beware all scams‚Ä¶ but recession like is never priced in until it actually happens

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 10:29:57'] I think this will benefit them a lot. Shares have been really "expensive" - obviously we all know share price doesn't dictate expensiveness, but for retail investors that can definitely be a barrier to entry.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 11:04:43'] Yes! Selling CSP's (cash secured puts) are back on the table! Doing it with the price at $500 was too rich.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:22:53'] I'm pretty warry of getting into stocks with suck high barriers of entry per stock, so a split down to $150-ish would make it much easier for me to get in to NVIDIA.Edit: Yes, fractional shares are a perfectly viable alternative, but my back-of-my-mind-buzzer prefers my shares to be in whole numbers.

(But then even some of those are still back ordered depending on the company.)But I think every ones forecasting is now all F'ed. Because forecasting random once every few decades events ain't easy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-02 11:16:43'] There is also a report that Apple shipped 5-10% more iPhones than expected last quarter, so the truth is somewhere between, most likely.   Though everyone is expecting a lousy quarter and it probably will be, any hint of getting past this by AAPL will send the stock up quite  bit very quickly. Plus, unless you believe Putin will wage war forever even without ammo or soldiers left, and the Fed will continue raising rates long after the economy has slowed down,  this is the time to BUY.  Everything except cryptos or TSLA, the latter because of its ultra high PE which is not justified.To me, the real golden goose is AAPL. My Colombian girlfriend's iphone died yesterday and boy did she panic. "I spend my whole life on that phone, I run my business on that phone, I need a new one now, please send $800". Then, as I queried her about fixing her old iPhone she ignored me and just bought a new one on credit for the asking price. She couldn't bear to be without it even for a few hours. Therefore, multiple her by a billion and contemplate the reality of today's world.    Besides basic food and survival, the iPhone is the top priority. I have seen homeless people with iPhones. In 2008, at the pits of that crash, I had 250,000 cash and decided to go all in when no one was buying stocks. I had to pick a stock though. I did the same mental math about "what is the last thing young people will give up even if there is a depression?" I decided it was the iPhone. I bought AAPl at $15 a share and accumuated more on steep selloffs and now have 55,000 shares. Warren Buffett also added to AAPL's value when he went heavily in, his first tech stock ever. So, in the time period when IO was growing my wealth with AAPL, through ups and downs, gold has been all over the place, cryptos were born, peaked during the covid lockdowns then crashed and now seem likely to die and disappear. and ten years from now if I dont sell any, my AAPL shares will probably be worth around 15 million dollars. So ,let this be a lesson. Want longterm stability and wealth growth? Invest in AAPL, and right now at $139, it is a bargain. No real risk at all.

POST_TEXT: b"[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/ftc-sues-to-block-nvidias-40-billion-acquisition-of-arm.html):\n\n* The proposed vertical deal would give one of the largest chip companies control over the computing technology and designs that rival firms rely on to develop their own competing chips, the FTC said in an announcement.\n\n* Nvidia stock was up over 2% on Thursday before the announcement, and did not move significantly on the news. The FTC complaint is not yet public.\n\n* FTC Chair Lina Khan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to lead the agency shortly after her confirmation to the agency earlier this year, has signaled an interest in more robust antitrust enforcement. \n\n* The trial before the FTCs own administrative law judge is set to begin on Aug. 9, 2022.\n\nThis is [not wholly a surprise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-latest-earnings-report-is-nail-in-coffin-for-40-billion-arm-deal-analyst-172042020.html) to people paying attention.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-02 17:17:03'] I knew it, when Jim Cramer was pumping the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-02 18:41:01'] Arm is currently owned by Softbank.Softbank is listed on the Tokyo exchange.Softbank's stock price is down today while the broader Japan index is up.Softbank would get around a billion if the acquisition doesn't proceed. Clearly the market doesn't think it's good for Softbank.Therefore, if anyone has followed acquisitions before - the acquirer stock price goes down and the acquired goes up.If this follows the rule, and what we see happen to Softbank, Nvidia's price should actually go up since it follows what tends to happen and it inverses Softbank's position.EDIT: ARM licenses their IP to other companies. They made a total of $300million for 6 months to Sep 30, 2021. People might ask why would NVDA go up?Well, it's because NVDA has to pay stock + cash to acquire ARM. Some cash would be forfeit, but they don't pay $10bn in cash and 44.37bn in shares (pre-split) which would be worth 56bn right now, and an additional $5bn or 10mil pre-split shares based on ARM meeting performance targets, and that would be worth almost 13bn right now.lSo NVDA may go up as they're not paying $10bn cash and up to 200mil shares, or over 70bn for ARM. We don't know how much ARM is worth as they're not publicly traded.

That should coincide with the expected price spike from the next havening, so I think it's still worth a look.* Tesla devaluation. The stans will hate me for this, but they are rapidly losing their edge (and Elon's attention). Ford Mach E is on par with the model Y. Rivian, Ford and GM all beat them to the punch on a truck. Cybertruck is years behind. The semi is finally coming out in beta. Build quality hasn't improved.

Stuff like muscle mass, height, etc.It's the kind of stuff we should be talking about today, because whether you like it or not, if we don't make rules now your kids will be bullied in school for not being genetically improved. It's absolutely insane what we are on the verge of.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 20:12:32'] I would look real estate ADJACENT. It'd be worth it to see which companies are expanding and buying commercial real estate, as any expansion COULD be seen as a sign of growth, or at the very least, a bubble period. If the company continues to do well, you'll see an increase in revenue, which can only be good for investors. If not, you can still hold out maybe an 8 month bubble? I mean, the rising stock price could last longer than that, but usually a company will know within its first year of expansion whether or not that was a sustainable cost, indicative of employee number growth, and the ability to still meet quarterly fiscal goals and market predictions.I'd pay close attention to metropolitan real estate, especially. It's a little easier to read about and stay updated on when any expansion like that will be having job openings published in their local news papers, and it's just easier to research that way, as there's just MORE business in metropolitan areas. So, condense your search down to one area that you can track thoroughly and frequently, and I think you have the best chance at finding the stocks that are right for you, instead of trying to follow market trends and analyses.You can take a look at the data, or you can just look around you. Both are still prediction.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:25:46'] Google invented this technology called Transformers with attention.   Here is the paper and it is excellent.   Love the title of the paper.https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762Google did also patent the important technology.https://patents.google.com/patent/US10452978B2/enOpenAI changed directions the day after the paper was released.   They used this breakthrough to create something called a Large Language Model.This type of AI is far from perfect but showing some amazing results.   Google had been holding back as there is a serious safety concerned.But Microsoft joining with OpenAI has decided to ignore any safety concerns and go full steam forward. Which has got Google to get going and also ignore the safety concerns as the horse is out of the barn.There is a ton of money to be made with this type of AI.   Many, including myself, speculate that most Fortune 500 companies will be using this technology and will be spending a lot of money to get their business into a LLM.  Their own on top of a general one.This type of application is also much more compute intensive than any other common Fortune 500 application.  So that means there is profits to be made by the big three, Google, Amazon and Microsoft.   Google margins should be a little better as they have the TPUs to leverage.   But this is also a big reason Nvidia is doing so well as Microsoft and Amazon will be use Nvidia for the inference.    But I suspect this is only in the intermediate term and you will see Microsoft and Amazon with their own TPU type devices so they can not be paying Nvidia the huge margins and instead enjoy for themselves.It is interesting that Google has the patent but they let people just use the key AI breakthrough for free.   But I highly doubt they are going to force anyone to pay them or even license.  It is not how Google rolls.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 20:52:09'] A lot of these stocks never any sense to me from an investor's perspective, and I'm saying this as someone who knows the EV industry well.* Lordstown - I have no idea why this stock ever appealed to anyone. I never even heard anyone hyped up for any of their vehicles. I doubt anyone but the most hardcore EV enthusiasts could even name one of their EV models that they've announced.* Lucid - At least it had promise with it's vehicle. But the problem is it simply entered the market too late and only sells very high end luxury vehicles. Also the Saudi backers are undermining the stock by forcing them to build a factory in Saudi Arabia, a country that's a good distance away from all 3 of the largest car markets (China, the US, & Europe) and where there's very little demand for EV's.* Nikola - The thing was clearly a scam from a mile away. And Hydrogen powered vehicles are NOT EV's, it doesn't matter to the consumer if the hydrogen is turned into electricity to run the car when there's no hydrogen refueling stations near them. IMO it's flat out false advertising to claim that Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are EVs given that it can confuse consumers.* Nio - Their battery swap stations make no sense. Tesla explored this many years ago in their early days but ditched it for good reason, it's way more expensive to scale then building out an EV charging infrastructure. And Battery-As-A-Service is a terrible idea to, which is why no one else has adopted the strategy. If it weren't for them pursuing these bad strategies then Nio would be a lot more viable IMO.* Rivian - This company simply moves WAY too slow to be successful. It took them 12 years to bring a single vehicle to market. Bottom line, if you want to invest in EV's just buy Tesla stock, it'll be a lot safer then any of these other EV stocks the OP mentions (given that they're sitting on a ton of cash and are making a profit, unlike the rest of these money losing EV stocks, most of which will probably go bankrupt sooner or later).

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 02:04:41'] >Intel goal at the moment is to gain enough GPU market share to beat NvidiaLol never got to happen.Nvidia doesn't have 80% GPU market share because the hardware is so great, they are at 80% because Nvidia is super strong in the next state of the art technology only achievable with Nvidia cards and very strong support for developers also mostly only available with Nvidia cards. Developers then develope games and other products with Nvidia GPU of course therefore Nvidia cards also perform often far better even when an AMD card seems stronger from the values, games still vastly run better with Nvidia cards. Same goes on for basically all industries require graphics cards or graphical services.I don't see neithe amd nor intel providing the same amount of tools and sources for graphical development and even then, nobody would double development cost including all tools, so most companies will stay with what the pipeline already uses unless intel or AMD provide VAST advancement over Nvidia which probably won't be the case within the next decade and especially intel has to recover from being kicked off the throne by AMD.>i would send a link to YouTube videos but Reddit doesn't allow to post YouTube links.Sure it does I did that often enough.

Not only is their core business a razor and blade model where they sell the tasers and then the disposable cartridges but they have expanded into body cameras and high margin software products which are growing very quickly. Their clients are recession resistant (3 to 5 year govt contracts) and they‚Äôve been delivering phenomenal revenue growth. The only competitor they have in the area might be Motorola but it‚Äôs not even close. They have the market cornered and clients continue to spend more with them every year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-15 03:42:44'] In my opinion auto dealers in general are overvalued everyone is basing their valuation from the pandemic days where people were forced to buy over MSRP and dealers weren‚Äôt incentivized to give out deals. Analysts that believe in these companies are hoping that consumers will continually overpay for their cars and that manufacturer incentives won‚Äôt come back so that dealers can maintain margins. When you have people underwater on their overpriced car it‚Äôs going to be hard to flip them into a new deal, some are taking themselves out the market due to the poor pricing and rising interest rates will decrease demand. Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs. Autonation for example had a random rally in their Q4 earnings despite net income dropping, a conveniently placed share buyback and the company themselves claiming that used cars will be more expensive for them to obtain. They‚Äôre now down -16% from that earning report. There‚Äôs still hard to obtain cars such as hybrids, EVs and enthusiast products but regular petrol models are widely becoming available without having to fight for MSRP.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 00:35:32'] If you actually just look at the history of Chinese aggression(or lack thereof), it becomes obvious that it doesn't matter if China actually invades Taiwan - all that matters is that people think they potentially will. The CCP has been proclaming thier intent to invade Taiwan since the 1950's. I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will continue to do so for the forseeable future, and thus TSMC's p/e ratio will remain at a discount relative to most of thier peers. You're only going to get paid that multibagger if you can convince others the risk of China invading is gone.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 01:05:30'] If they were a US company, sure they would have a higher valuation but that's only a small piece of the story.The bigger story is that their days of higher margins and growing revenues have stopped as per TSM's own financial release.For Q2 2023, TSM has guided to the following:||Q2 2023 (guidance)|Q2 2022||:-|:-|:-||Revenue|15.2 - 16bn (-14% YoY)|18.16bn||Operating Margin|39.5% - 41.5% (-17.5% YoY)|49.1%||Operating Income|6bn - 6.6bn (-29% YoY)|8.9bn|The finances of companies change quickly, especially for a chip company.The decline is a stark contrast to their 3-year history where they doubled their revenues.I think it will be some years before the next boom cycle begins. Remember you're calculating their PE ratio based on the peak of the cycle, and the stock price is looking towards the decline part of their cycle. You want to invest when their valuation is high (because earnings are at the trough of the cycle) and the cycle is beginning to boom.If you reduce their earnings by 30% (as per their -29% YoY guidance), PE goes up from 14 to 20.Another factor is that earnings is just an accounting figure - includes depreciation which was spent 5 years ago, and it doesn't factor in expenditure today.Their Q1 2018 capex was 2.5bn.Their Q1 2023 depreciation is 3.6bn.Their Q1 2023 capex is 9.93bn. This means higher depreciation charge going forward which reduces EPS.Their Q1 FCF = 2.7bn which is well below their net income of 6.8bn.There is not a chance in hell their capex is ever going to go back to 2.5bn.Their FCF for the last 4 quarters is 16.1bn, which gives a P/FCF ratio of 27.9.For comparison, ASML's capex in 2018 (full year) only increased from 0.60bn EUR to 1.32bn EUR.ASML's P/FCF ratio is 31.5 which is not that much higher than TSM's P/FCF.ASML's guidance&#x200B;||Q2 2023 (guidance in USD)|Q2 2022||:-|:-|:-||Revenue|\~7.02 - 7.56bn (27.8% YoY)|5.7bn ||Operating Margin|30% (no change)|30%||Operating Profit|2.1 - 2.27bn (26% YoY)|1.73bn|ASML expects full year 2023 sales to be 25% greater than 2022.Unless TSM's guidance is really bad and they out deliver massively, it's clear that they are NOT cheap when looking at their negative revenue growth expectations and lagging earnings numbers due to their capex increasing 4x in 5 years.ASML is justifiably valued higher as their revenue growth is still intact and capex has only increased 2-3x. (Reminder that TSM's higher capex is good for ASML, since they're one of ASML's customers).

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 01:52:39'] No, the semiconductor market had a veritable boom and that was reflected in the high price increase. But from all earnings reports, it has become quite clear that the boom is ending. It's a very cyclical industry and the problem is that foundries have to plan ahead through that. So TSMC invested a lot of money in new capacities as well as Intel did, but when these capacities start becoming operational, the market is likely to be down.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 02:01:28'] This post made me chuckle. Who would've thought that former chip giant INTC would have to be the "next" anything 20 years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 02:27:24'] For me, Intel is the Nokia of semiconductors, the upper management was filled by business people which made some very bad technical decisions. Now the train has left the station, and they were left behind, it's too late to catch up as the competition has become very fierce. They lost the design edge to AMD and the production edge to TSMC.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:20:57'] I remember when people were counting out amd and nvidia when intel dominated, so I can‚Äôt really say intel is done for especially since intel is still in better shape than they were back then. Intel still is building out it fabs and I‚Äôm really curious to see their next gen chips and see how they expand on their gpu market. Also want to see how their foundry business will compete with tsm. We will find out over the next few years. I like intel here in the 20‚Äôs. But they have definitely dropped the ball in recent years. They are taking steps to turn the business back around but we won‚Äôt see the fruits of that labor at least for a few more years. At this point it‚Äôs more of a long term speculative play than a short term bet. If they can turn the business around yes they are very undervalued but if not it will just keep sinking. It‚Äôs a make or break moment for intel
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:43:45'] the way people feel about Intel now seems very similar to how everyone felt about Face/Meta last year
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:03:55'] If you want to take a risk, yes, investing in Intel has decent potential. However if you want to play it safe, I would wait til next earnings before buying in. Their last 2 earnings were awful and the CEO said both times that the worst is over.It's really up up to this quarter. The stock will either tank or jump up. Personally, I'm feeling bullish on Intel but it's a pure feeling play. If Intel were to turn things around, now is the time. If it isn't now, then it's never imo.and also to be clear, Intel might be a good investment, but no, it's not gonna be "the next NVDA"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:46:39'] They will never become the behemoth they once were, and will steadily lose market shares in the coming years. However, they will remain an important player in a more diverse ecosystem. They will play an important part in the American semi-conductor strategy (being heavily subsidized by the taxpayers to build foundries to ramp up domestic chip production).   They still build excellent CPUs that equip a large fraction of the laptops and the PCs sold worldwide, and their ARC GPU is apparently quite decent. Event better than a similarly priced NVIDIA GPU.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 01:50:20'] Intel missed the boat on AI, just like they missed the boat on mobile processors 10-15 years ago when the smartphone revolution happened. They are behind both Nvidia and AMD at this point (AMD has AI specific chips coming out in the 2nd half of this year).AI heavy workloads don't need much CPU processing - Intel's bread and butter. The more the future looks like AI the worse it is for Intel. AI chatbots eating away at search means Intel's TAM will shrink (at the very least growth that would've needed more CPU's will instead need more AI specific GPU's and custom silicon from Nvidia and AMD. At worst the market for server CPU's will shrink). And it benefits Intel's direct competitors in that CPU space, AMD/TSMC.

They are hemorrhaging money and even though their runway is decades out, fading to nothing is not exactly something I would want to invest in.That being said I bought 5 at like 26 because I'll be damned if I'm wrong and a train comes and leaves without at least my toes being on the train.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 01:38:19'] The insight that Nvidia is growing is because of data center or AI processors. GPU for AI has different optimization and works differently than GPU for normal use, that gives Nvidia an edge over other GPU makers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 11:05:14'] Intel has essentially become a speculative stock now. It‚Äôs fallen behind the competition and doesn‚Äôt currently bring much to the table. There is a chance they could quickly catch up. They recently cut their dividend (resulting in more money for the company) and the US government is pushing for more domestic chips. If you buy intel you‚Äôre basically betting the management can make some not terrible decisions, which has been a losing bet for the past 20 years. I think it‚Äôs worth a small portion of my portfolio. If you want to put on your tin foil hats, intel might get some of the China market. Intel has made some recent trips to China very close to the Micron ban. Keep in mind the timing could easily be a coincidence.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 16:53:52'] 1. Focus on getting a (higher) income and investing as much of that income into the market as possible on a regular basis. That way you can ask /r/stocks, "What should I do with my $100-$500 in excess cash that I earn every single month that will compound into thousands as I increase my savings rate over time"?  If you're in high school or something, get educated and maximize your earnings potential.2. Rethink your priorities about wanting to 'have money' each month. That shouldn't be the goal of investing at this presumably early stage. You want to grow your portfolio by contributing as much as you can as early as you can. What is $30 in dividends each year ($4 a month?) going to give you? Unless you are retired or already have a very large portfolio, chasing tiny sums of dividends is pointless. If you want income, find a job, don't sabotage your investment portfolio by siphoning off the dividends!3. Focus on diversified strategies for your regular investments. My guess is you aren't doing a lot of research into individual stocks (if you are, my apologies) and randomly picking blue chips is a poor strategy. (Have you investigated the valuations of MCD? Its free cash flow? Dividend growth? Does it compare favorably to treasuries? Do you expect it to outgrow the S&P 500?)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 12:59:00'] Be careful just looking at dividend yield. Extremely high ones tend to be because of problems. You might want to narrow down what you're looking for specifically in terms of yield.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 15:37:47'] Vanguard knows their stuff. Here are the top three holdings in their "High Dividend Yield" ([VHYAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vhyax)) index fund:1. Exxon Mobil2. Johnson & Johnson3. JPMorgan ChaseChoose reliable companies like these and commit for the long run. Set your dividends to automatically reinvest, and leave 'em alone.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 18:10:35'] I like ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks / tech stocks with a dividend bonus, even though may be small - like Apple and Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 20:17:57'] ABBV, EPD( it‚Äôs an MLP), NEP. Do yourself a favor and reinvest the dividends automatically. The power of Drip cannot be understated.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 08:14:22'] Easiest answer is to look at the Dividend Aristocrat list. Vanguard offers an ETF for the Dividend Aristocrat as well. [List](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/dividend-stocks/dividend-aristocrats/)Edit: FYI IBM is over 5% currently

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 15:03:55'] I like ABBV for dividend yield and a bit of growth.If you are in for the long term, I also like JPM at a 3% yield and they will survive what happens in banking.  For higher yeilds, I like midstream $ET which is returning close to 9% of capital each year.  Keep in in a taxable account, you don't pay taxes until you sell, you have to enter a K1 each year.  It can be subjected to a special tax in a tax advantaged account.For a REIT, I like $VICI.  They provide funding for local casinos, should be pretty recession proof and a nice return.  Put it in a tax advantage account.&#x200B;This is for entertainment only, I am not an advisor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 12:58:55'] There's all kinds of things that pay dividends. There's individual stocks in mature companies, funds, and REITs. The dividends on the first 2 are 15%, but  if you want a Real Estate fund (REIT) it's taxed at your income tax rate.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 07:45:41'] In my personal opinion, not many people have been doing this level of analysis before purchasing. And, now, when valuations start to matter, buyers dry up and prices tend to fall. It‚Äôs been very difficult to justify its recent price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 18:01:52'] Nancy Pelosi bought some Nvidia calls so it‚Äôs a buy for me
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 11:44:32'] When investor confidence goes back up, which it will, I think the stock price will go up with it. Market has already showed it is willing to pay a premium for it and other tech stocks, and nothing has changed fundamentally
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 08:35:26'] Great analysis. A good company with exciting future growth doesn‚Äôt always mean a great idea to buy. I‚Äôm in the same position where I‚Äôd really like to own that stock, but 80 p/e means a huge amount of growth would be needed to even put it even with the rest of the market
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 10:47:28'] I use three metrics to determine fair value; sales, earnings, and free cash flow. Depending on which you use Nvidia is fairly valued between $187-$354.  If you have new money, look elsewhere.  If you own it, I would hang on, especially if it is a taxable account.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 18:23:14'] I'm not saying I agree with it, but if you look at the [Analysis](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/analysis?p=NVDA) tab of Yahoo finance, they have a projected next-5-year annualized earnings growth of 39.37% (compared to a past-5-year growth rate of 52.83%). If you really believe that, the current value is a steal (a quick-and-dirty DCF model arrived at something like a \~$520 fair value for the stock if you use that number). Although I do own NVDA indirectly via ETFs, that estimate seems overly optimistic. But I haven't done enough research to know how the analysts arrive at that projected growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 18:25:47'] It hasn't been trading on valuation for a number of years. If the crypto cycle is ending now and card demand backs off that stock could get cut in half just like it did in 2018. It's a rough one though because it's almost like another tesla. It's full of fanboys. There's no real logical valuation on either one of those but as long as people are buying it doesn't really matter. In the long run people are likely to get smoked on both of them if they just continue to hold but who knows when that comes
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 23:34:52'] I'm always glad to see people put thought behind investments, nice work.  I hope you question is sincere and you are not just being a bear, hiding in the shadows and pretending to want to learn.I do not have my research with me but there are a few things to consider, the first is your 20% growth rate.  If you look at the past 5-years, I feel like their demonstrated EPS growth was greater than 45% with the most recent year being closer 85%.  Additionally their 3-5 year projected is maybe 35% to 45%.  As a longtime holder, I know I have never seen a forward EPS projection of greater than 50% so there is room for them to surprise high.  IMO, this puts them at greater than 40% growth, not 20% as you state.  The second point I would like to address is time, you mention can they maintain this performance for a decade.  If you consider we are in the first 6 to 7 years of the 4th industrial revolution and each of the prior IRs have last between 50 and 70 years, yes I firmly believe we can assume another decade of their performance.  We all know they are at the forefront of some major 4IR themes like AI, automation, AR/VR but they are also already playing a role in the next wave of ARKG like things, which I believe is still 10+ years out, such as (forgive me for not recalling these items well, they are too far out for me to have spent much time researching) protein incubators, synthetic proteins, and biochambers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 07:53:19'] I do think NVDA is at a premium.But you can't always value a company using fundamentals and usual value models.Cars will use more and more chips. From 100 to 1,000 to maybe even 10,000+.Data centers will have to keep growing. Look at all the streaming companies DIS, HBO, NFLX, etc. More content needs to be stored and streamed.Internet and apps will need data centers.Emerging markets will start needing phones and modern infrastructure.Asian nations are building smart cities.Another good example is printer ink, they didn't have chips so they need a work around. Recent article lately.Hard to model that kind of demand.Also demand aside. Some companies trade at a premium for their history of growth and stability. Like MSFT, AAPL, O, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 08:00:12'] If crypto really crashes they could have some quarters of negative growth like in 2018 and if that happens it will go below 100
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 12:52:21'] They face a lot of risks from Ethereum going proof of stake and Intel entering the GPU market. I don't think their growth will continue at the same pace for long. I'd use a P/E of 20-25, putting their fair value at about $70-80 per share
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-10 11:09:09'] Your analysis is to the point. This is exactly the reason why I was trying to convince a good friend of mine to sell mid November. With imminent rate hikes and a resulting lower relative profitability of stocks vs bonds it was unavoidable that things would turn sour with the likes of extremely highly valued stocks like NVDA and such. Awesome company, absurd valuation. He did not listen, however his cost basis is somewhere in the low hundreds so I think he will be fine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 06:36:40'] Disagree. On the compute side, no one is using intel based processors for ML workloads. AMD is cheaper, and far cheaper still are ASICs, ARM-based processors, and so much of the ML community relies on cuda through NVIDIA GPUs. On the manufacturing side, intel fabs are several lithography generations behind TSMC. Intel itself uses TSMC for the latest generation processors because their fabs are behind. Investing in new fab tech is always a multi-year gamble ahead and we haven‚Äôt seen the customer base or the steep investment in new cutting edge fab techniques. What intel has going for it is xenophobic gov buyers who want American vertical integration, even if it means semiconductors are less efficient or several generations behind the state of the art.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 07:29:14'] It is really hard for Intel to compete with TSMC.  Simply because "everything" is much cheaper to make in asia.  Even TSMC says it'll cost them much more to build chips in the USA than their factory in Taiwan.  Another example is Tesla cars are much cheaper to make in their shanghai factory than their USA factory.  It also puzzled my mind when people says Tesla have such good manufacturing ability when Chinese are building cars at a fraction of the price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 12:53:35'] The fact that the government wants to use your tax money to invest in Intel should tell you how bad of an investment this is. Just look at GM.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:38:16'] 46% is in US index ETFs (VOO, VTI and QQQ are almost identical but I don't mind the "diversification" in management and a little bit of mid small cap).I'm not gonna judge the individual stocks. We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think "gambling" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.If you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.I think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important.

And if not. what other plays in the same sector are trading at better valuations?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:46:04'] AMD or NVDA to invest in?  Both companies are doing really well does anyone own both?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:06:14'] I‚Äôve been buying NVDA weekly since 2016 and will continue to do so‚Ä¶ they are greatly positioning themselves to become the leader in anything AI related if they‚Äôre already not. Now with this meta stuff along with gaming becoming more popular, I‚Äôve never been more bullish. This is my retirement stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:50:05'] Buy it. And AMDI‚Äôve been suggesting these 2 (and INTC and still do) for yearsCash rich, innovative, tech company breaking barriers**People told me years ago that the prices were already too high.**
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:32:11'] You could always wait until earnings on November 17th. The stock is priced for perfection and anything other than massive beats and raised guidance will probably send it down.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 19:50:03'] I watched NVDA for roughly 18 months, telling myself it couldn‚Äôt keep going up. It doubled in the meantime, then I bought it and it dropped 40% two weeks later. I doubled my investment. I think I‚Äôm up about 300% now. I just bought another 7 shares on Monday.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:04:11'] I just keep buying and it keeps going.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 19:14:17'] Lots of people in here saying to wait. It's been that way for like 4 years anytime am Nvidia thread pops up. At some point you either believe they will be higher in the future and buy or you don't. Waiting around in general will lose you alot of money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:24:18'] If I had some money to invest, Nvidia would definitely be at the top of the list. That thing is just gonna keep growing for years and years to come
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 12:23:07'] Some of the best companies trade at a premium at (almost) all times. Nvidia will play an important part in the metaverse, so I‚Äôd think it‚Äôs a good long-term stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:54:47'] Does anyone know why recently it jumped from $230 to $250 in one day? There was even some bad news about even more delays to the ARM deal. But the stock kept flying.Also, if I want to sell covered calls, what's a safe range to not get called.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 12:36:27'] The current PE ratio for Nvidia is above 80. The 10Y median PE ratio is 31.Now, either its growth, which is already insane, will start accelerating even more and earnings will catch up or its PE ratio will eventually revert to the mean.The hype around the stock can last for months if not years though so I think the question you'd want to ask yourself is: "am I an investor or a gambler?".
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:48:39'] Now people dont understand, that Nvidia is much more now than gaming graphic cards..I would buy more, it can just keep going upwards!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:57:22'] I bought it two years ago and will keep it for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 18:03:16'] You don't have to buy whole shares, fractional shares can be fine too if you just want to get your feet wet and then DCA or go big when there is a pullback.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:58:13'] Just put in $1k.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 16:55:05'] Not a buy because Nanci Palosi started unloading hers
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 12:37:33'] At this evaluation I would wait.Intel will have a new GPU which complete with the mid range 3070 NVIDIA cards.  If Intel opens the driver to let the card work in a shared environment then NVIDIA will take a hit on both consumer and corporate markets.The chip shortage may cause the price to drop after earning in Nov.I will wait to buy in at around 205-220 (I have an order of 800 shares at 205 but may need to increase it up a little - definitely not at 250 range).  I am not in any rush to jump in at ATH.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 16:27:16'] It‚Äôs a good company, but the valuation is too rich for me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 18:40:18'] NVDA has random pullbacks every year. Buy then and wait for it to run. It wasn‚Äôt very long ago it pulled back to 200. I considered adding but since it‚Äôs my largest position I added elsewhere instead.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 01:19:38'] It's undervalued until $2T marketcap.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 02:08:26'] I got into NVDA after the stock split and am up over 30% in a matter of weeks.I've read a couple articles casting doubt on the future of the stock but I will buy every major dip from here on out. This company is already doing extremely well but I'm expecting to see it absolutely dominate and that's why it's one of my retirement stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 06:08:01'] Yes easily, nvda will still be climbing for years. They literally make the most important computer part
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 17:52:08'] So no one really comments with the perspective of valuation, instead of just telling how bullish they are and their previous performance. Smh
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:05:49'] I was flogging the crap out of them just before the run-up happened. Now all the growth value is priced in and I'm not sure it outperforms the other high performers in the semiconductor sector going forward. So spreading the money around but making sure to have some Nvidia shares is a good idea.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 12:24:09'] I don‚Äôt know about valuation, but as a speculation I own and continue to buy. I like their focus on AI, their products, and their interest in acquiring ARM which I also love.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:35:40'] I sold a few shares, just to rebalance the portfolio.  But this stock has been on an absolute tear this year.  The only thing standing in the way could be chip shortage / supply chain issues hurting earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 12:41:48'] Intel is obviously trading at better valuations. Micron also has a p/e below 15 and good prospects.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:10:07'] RemindMe! 2 years

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 15:57:58'] I love the stock but it seems too high. I think some stocks that show good fundamentals should be a better return like PayPal
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 12:28:59'] If you're asking, then you don't know much about nvda. Still a buy short of a macro economic event but this clearly depends on the buyers views.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 16:55:54'] My buy signal is when the P/E drops to below 76.  Nvidia is a great metaverse play as well.  If I were you, I‚Äôd buy a bit now before earnings, then more post-earnings as long as the aforementioned P/E rule is confirmed post earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 17:25:27'] Currently have some ITM calls exp March 2022, I really love the company and want to own shares, does it make sense for me to exercise the calls?  I'm up almost 200% on these calls
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 18:59:48'] DCA into NVDA until there is a pullback and then go big.  It‚Äôs one of 5 top stocks to be building your biggest position in .  IMO
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 19:07:25'] I think AMD will catch up. They make CPUs too. Intel will also catch up with their GPUs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 19:32:00'] It is my largest holding. I own shares and also deep itm leaps for 2023. Leaps are already up 40% since the recent pullback to $208
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 22:28:56'] When I first started investing I was mulling over whether to go with AMD or Nvidia instead of just accepting I could go with both. Even though I don't regret going with AMD, I do regret not having bought into a lot sooner than I already have.    Sure they've had a huge run in the last year, but look at other companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla who just continue to go up and up despite their insanely highly valuations.    So yes the price may seem high right now, but if you believe in them long term you can easily argue they're still relatively cheap.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 23:12:22'] Unpopular opinion, wait a bit. Looking at the technicals its rsi is really high, overbought and it might dip soon. no one knows when of course but be patient, there will always be opportunities. I have 2r4 shares and up by 80% been wanting to add but not at this levels, it ran up so high. &#x200B;of course if you dont care about your time horizon or technicals, just buy anytime. I just want you to get more upside.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:48:08']  It's never a better time to invest than right now if you believe in what the company is doing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 18:45:38'] Nvidia is all about cryto right now. So you need to ask yourself if you believe in crpto or not?If not, then avoid it. Because if crypto falls, Nvidia will crash very hard. All growth will stop instantly because PC sales and general GPU sales are actually shrinking. Their rev will likely be slashed 50% or more.If you think cryto coins will continue to be valuable then sure. Nvidia will be like a crypto inflation hedge. As crypto inflates, it will take Nvidia with it.One caveat. Intel has announced that they are finally going to compete on GPU with AMD and Nvidia. They have always made GPU's but they never focused on performance before. But they can most assuredly compete. They have the tech and manufacturing to do so. Further its not really a GPU that makes mining better, its simply the parallelism that was built into GPU's about 10 years ago. There is no reason why you cant build that into any regular CPU. In fact, it a lot more efficient to place that feature directly on the CPU. I wouldnt worry about Intel yet, but you do need keep an eye on them. The good news is they have been mismanaged for over 20 years now and its hard to overcome bad management because they are usually entrenched hard in the upper echelons. For every Apple there are 100 IBMs, T's and Xerox's.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 16:56:22'] Overpriced as hell, if you're looking for other players in the chip industry it's Intel.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 20:22:00'] Nope. Tech stocks are all overvalued right now. Commodities and uranium miners is the way to go
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 20:38:40'] Nvidia goes up and crypto goes up. Buy!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 03:21:22'] People have lost their damn minds thinking 75x EV/EBITDA is an appropriate price to pay for a semiconductor play like nvidia
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 07:00:57'] Nvidia has invested so much into future technologies like AI that it‚Äôs impossible for it to fail at this point.

POST_TEXT: b'As the title says at the time of this post, both META and Nvidia are hovering ~170ish. This piqued my interest so I took a quick look at the financials and META (of course) has magnitudes more operating cash flow than Nvidia, a more favorable DTI, more long term assets... \n\nIt seems obvious to me that META is the better ticker, does anyone have insights on the price similarity? My only guess is that investors see Nvidia earnings as more of a sure thing maybe.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 02:30:25'] Lol people in comment section assuming FB is DECLINING and losing it's moat. This is the opportunity of a lifetime IMO. You guys realize FB grew 37% in 2021 and kept that growth? Despite ATT changes by Apple?"Fuck the metaverse": Yeah, but who cares its not even 5% of their business. It's a free call option at this price. Instagram alone is worth >300-400 bil. They have 30% NET INCOME MARGINS. Despite spending 10-20% of revs on R&D.Not everything is about growth. Valuation matters and MOAT matters. Nothing beats FB's network effects. I am especially bullish on  Whatsapp business which is ingrained worldwide (ex. NA)
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 11:13:04'] Can‚Äôt compare them but I like META more at its current valuation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 10:24:25'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 10:39:23'] First off, having a similar share price doesn't mean the two have similar valuations.  In this case, they happen to have similar valuations ($427B vs $497B), but that is a coincidence.  Share price is meaningles....look at market cap.The future prospects might be very different for the two.  I think both might be good stocks, but Nvidia might have more upside for every dollar of earnings, hence the similar valuations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 10:23:31'] I am heavily invested in nvidia and wouldn‚Äôt touch META with a 10 ft pole. Nvidia has a much better growth potential and I have great faith in their products/innovation. I don‚Äôt like METAs current risky investments in several fields that I can see them being surpassed in
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 10:14:43'] META is better PE wise but its growth nonexistent. NVDA grows and executes much better but too expensive for current market. I think NVDA is very worth getting into at 120, not 170. META I won't touch it unless I see how it's strategy can stop the stagnant growth. Even 170 is too high for negative growth and it's staring at 2nd privacy shock (from Android this time) in less than 2 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 11:02:39'] It‚Äôs not even close Nvdia is going to look cheap at this price in 10 years. I have been selling off diversification just buy more Nvdia. I think Nvdia will be the apple of the next decade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 11:31:12'] I own both. I‚Äôm concerned about Meta right now. They are pausing projects which is never a good sign for growth
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 11:08:43'] And you all blame HFs, CHs, and IBs for the reason retail trading is a losing game.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 11:16:52'] Already said in less than 2 years it'll get the same privacy shock for Android this time. That privacy shock from Apple also lasted longer than people thought too. I don't know how much you know about investing but you clearly were not familiar with even the recent earnings reports. Why argue incessantly then?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 11:20:47'] I dont think meta is the better stock
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 11:48:49'] share price in isolation has nothing to do with anything. i guess you could look at market caps of both.. but even that doesn't tell the whole story. what it really all boils down to is this: 1) what is the free cash flow per share today vs. the price of the stock today2) what do you expect the free cash flow per share to be in the next 1, 3, 5 years (etc)3) what is each company doing to increase 1 and 2 (are they using free cash to buy back their stock? are they investing free cash flow today to grow free cash flow in the future?)all these fancy terms, theories, charts, etc... what i've outlined above is really all that matters
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-10 12:12:43'] If you believe Facebook's earnings issues and political blowback are short term, then it is by far the better investment.If not Nvidia...but you have to believe it will keep growing at a very aggressive rate.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 05:19:40'] NVDA is expensive at 170 but their competitor AMD is a better buy at its current price
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-12 06:07:10'] I bought META heavily in thursday and Friday, Sure I am down a little it but I will buy even more if it goes down next week. I think this company is way undervalued because people hate it, they have tons of cash in their bank account and they have almost the whole earth on their apps/social networks. Even if they monetize whatsapp and some of the other projects they are working on, they will see a stock price jump in double digits. That's a huge positive for me. This company does not cost 475.15B, it should be double.

But it's time to be real about these companies and the SPY in general.

And I'd argue Google is also very, very richly valued.\n\nnVidia's P/E is 100. One day the music will stop. For those wondering, look at what happened to Intel and Cisco in 2000.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 11:26:37'] Google PE ratio today is ~28.7, how is this company very very richly valued? They have insane revenue and a much lower PE valuation compared to other tech companies
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 07:43:44'] It‚Äôs a fair and pragmatic point, which others have already raised.  I would argue that reliance on semiconductor companies is much higher now than it was in 2000.  Virtually everything in reliant on computer chips these days.  Cars, televisions, appliances, thermostats, vacuum cleaners, etc etc etc all require these, where 20 years ago many of these devices or tools were not reliant, or nearly as reliant in chips.  Tesla is a bit of a different story, but there is clearly a belief that Tesla is more than just an automaker.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 07:50:05'] The valuations are based on future potential. No one knows how it will end up, so you can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs overvalued because the future is uncertain. Tesla‚Äôs value is based not just on the cars but the potential of it‚Äôs AI, solar business, and this is just the beginning stages of EV. Nvidia is the best graphics company in the world. And we are only just scratching the surface with AI. Pretty soon everything will require a chip, from your bed to your fridge to your dildo.I‚Äôm saying the potential is there for many years to come so there is a good chance these are the next biggest companies in the world.

POST_TEXT: b'SoftBanks $66bn sale of UK-based chip business Arm to Nvidia collapsed on Monday after regulators in the US, UK and EU raised serious concerns about its effects on competition in the global semiconductor industry, according to three people with direct knowledge of the transaction.\n\nThe deal, the largest ever in the chip sector, would have given California-based Nvidia control of a company that makes technology at the heart of most of the worlds mobile devices. A handful of big tech companies that rely on Arms chip designs, including Qualcomm and Microsoft, had objected to the purchase.\n\nSoftBank will receive a break-up fee of up to $1.25bn and is seeking to unload Arm through an initial public offering before the end of the year, according to one of the people.\n\nThe failure is set to result in a management upheaval at Arm, with chief executive Simon Segars being replaced by Rene Haas, head of the companys intellectual property unit, the person added.\n\nThe collapse of the deal robs '

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 11:48:05'] >"No new information"They just revealed earnings after market close yesterday, indicating their revenue is down due to supply shortages, and lots of capex is expected.Their capital expenditures will put pressure on their dividend, as even if they maintain solid earnings, those earnings are going right into investing in new fabs. Those may take several years to pay off, so there are short term price risks if investors sell off due to a dividend cut/suspension.I bought a lot of shares today due to the dip, I think they're a good value buy, but it's certainly not "no new information".

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 12:19:12'] Their GPU sales are not going to help them for their next quarter. I personally don't expect much from their GPUs for 2-3 years until they get good at both hardware and software. If they can release a decent GPU with decent price and inventory, they can sell a lot since demand is high.They will release Alderlake this November but AMD is going to release Zen 3D and Zen 4 in less than a year so their superiority is going to be short-lived.P/E is low because profit is shrinking. It will take them 3-5 years to be competitive against TSMC and they have to spend a lot. By the time all those factories are built, chip shortage might be over. It is a good stock if you can buy and hold. If there is a market downturn they will be less affected than AMD and NVDA. I will buy around 45$.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 12:23:19'] Intc is a dividend company. Their shares dont move too much..  thats the difference between them and amd/nvda. Those last ones are pure growth stocks.So.. dont expect intc to hit 70 soon..

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 22:40:39'] Let's take away this "vision" everyone seems to be talking about and people like to buy into.Let's look at their almost non-existent revenue growth over the past five years, while competitors actually are growing their revenue. Let's look at their 35 % performance over the past five years, while the rest of the market has gone up like crazy. (Divs not included.)  Let's compare their debt to their cash balance and realize, that they've got about three times more debt than cash in a market relying heavily on cash.Let's look at their extreme amount of share buybacks, which is money not moving into RnD and (yes) diluting their share price as if they're living in a parallel universe. Not all buybacks are good buybacks.Intel is lagging behind with its technology. I like a good company story and sometimes do turnaround plays. Outside of this vision, there is sadly no sign on paper as to why this company should and will turn at some point other than some nebulous vision and it's brand name.I'll be buying in once the fundamentals change at least a little bit, but I'm not seeing it right now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 11:20:04'] For all those saying AMD is a better buy, do you even use AMD computers/Graphics cards? They have far more bugs than anyone else and many users are not interested in them due to these kinds of issues. Intel has a market perception of coding their drivers much better and being way more stable ie. less bugs.Specs arent everything, user experience and quality control matters.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 04:25:01'] In my opinions, If Intel sacrifice 10% of their profit i.e. reducing the product prices, to sell more chips‚Ä¶ they would kill AMD. Intel have room to do so, but does not AMD. AMD profit is not sufficient at the moment to absorb a lost in of 10% of their market share. [AMD earning 2.5B/year vs 20B/year of Intel.]
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 05:29:48'] While I am a long term INTC bull, they definitely are not a get rich quick scheme but rather a pure value play for me.  They have great revenue/earnings, demonstrate growth, have potential to demonstrate a lot of growth, great fcf, pe, ps, pb, solid dividend.  Their industry is being labeled essential to national security and all devices of the future will rely on products that they make.  They are consistently one of the biggest spenders on R&D every year, globally.  I don't see much downside at the current levels and given their long term ROCE, the stock price should reflect the same.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 11:27:15'] It‚Äôs not easy to turnaround a company like intel. If I‚Äôm not wrong, they are just buying time with no proper execution. We are seeing apple-blackberry story brewing between intel-amd.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 02:18:01'] ARM and AMD are going to keep taking away market share. Intel will go from dominant CPU maker to one of many. I think talent will be going to Intel‚Äôs competitors cause they pay much more and are already ahead.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 21:27:22'] No new information? How about their revenue miss? Lol.Intel is a value trap. Their future isn't bright. Their core technology is certain for death and they have been unable to break out of it. Now competitors all around them are eating their lunch - this has been known for a while. Their new leader seems great but also desperate - it's likely too late. Their foundry business will make or break them now and difference is they will be the underdog.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-22 21:54:51'] You're clearly not keeping up with the market.-%20 loss of revenue in the data center sector, -%2 in the consumer sector.Their execuse used to be COVID, then digestion, then Pat was talking about shortages even though they don't have that issue because they make their own chips, and now they're blaming shortage of other parts that make up consumer machines and cloud providers making their own chips.Reality is, AMD is eating into their market share. It's been going on quarter after quarter. Intel goes first, announces losses, then AMD goes up and announces growth.Intel is FAR behind TSMCs manufacturing ability and AMD's innovation. People love to say "BuT tHe Nm CaLcUlAtIoNs ArE nOt CoRrEcT!" it's not all about the raw hardware.TSMC has smaller size dies, better heat management, and AMD's innovation allows for more cores, better big.LITTLE implementation, better consumer software, and more stable TDP.Let's pretend I'm talking out of my ass and Intel and TSMC dies are the same. Fuck it, TSMCs is lesser. Does that change the consumer delivered performance? The server power saving? No, and that's what really matters here: Selling the product.Intel lacks hardware and software innovation and Pat isn't solving that. People don't wanna work there, and the ones that do aren't fixing that issue.

Also, you should never ask reddit for their opinion, just by reading the comments we can come to the conclusion that 99% of these investors have literally no idea how the market works as their advices are extremely dumb and short sighted.

POST: ['2022-07-14 19:49:36'] POST TITLE: b"Is nVidia ignoring customers wishes for more energy efficient GPU's?"
POST_TEXT: b'I saw someone mensioning it in the daily thread a few days ago and it made me think.\n\nThis is one of the measuresment that I put on a company. How well they listend to their general public customers, even though their proffesional sale\'s make up a lot of their revenue.\n\nI am from a country that can make alot of electricity from renewable sources so this isn\'t really something I would think about on my energy bill. It\'s just that low.\n\nSo are they? Are nVidia not responding to a market demand?\n\nNot to mention what I\'ve heard about their GPU\'s pricing. That\'s a different topic, something I\'m not looking for answears on right now. \n\nnVidia has dropped alot. I am seriously thinking about thinking about starting a position soon.\n\nEdit: For clearity, what I mean was: "*The idea was that customers don\'t require the performance increases they are putting out every year. They just want never versions of same performance but more energy efficiency.*"'
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 20:04:08'] I would say that is lower on the customer wish list. Performance is king in this market. Nvidia makes the most powerful cards consistently. And with that comes a higher power need.If you go to any of the PC subs or PC reviews, generally power draw concerns are only related to power supply capacity. Any mention of actual power draw as it relates to energy consumption is usually in passing. The other concern with high power draw is more heat. The higher power draw cards also generally come at a price premium and so the target market for that isn't generally concerned with the cost of electricity to power it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 19:53:54'] I thought the reason is they can't without being able to increase performance every year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 20:05:30'] They make various levels of GPU's and each year they go up in performance. With the increase in performance I'm sure they optimize energy efficiency as best they can. If the increase to performance was linear with the number of watts it takes to run you would need a nuclear reactor to power your GPU (editorializing but still...)I'm no expert but a quick Google search shows Nvidia's first GPU ever had a recommended 200 watts. A 3080 is under 400 watts. The difference in performance and capabilities between those are, well practically like Atari vs high end VR.If someone wants a more energy efficient GPU they can go for a lower end GPU and use software to reduce the output and therefore the power drain. It's something that already exists, you can run at 70%. Why would they make a new line of GPU's that are not better than the last when you can just buy one of the previous generations or throttle the GPU?That's like asking why isn't apple making a nokia brick phone that can last on battery for 10 days straight. Sure, maybe it's possible but that's not advancing technology/performance/capabilities/or the product line. It just doesn't make sense. If you really want that ^ go buy the 20 year old nokia brick which used to last for like 10 days.Tldr; the customer isn't always right, more often then not the customer is an idiot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 21:06:33'] I can't think of a scenario in which any of the main consumers of GPU would prefer the same performance w/ less energy vs. more performance. PC enthusiasts always want the shiniest new thing and undervolting your GPU isn't going to lead to any noticeable energy savings. CAD / 3D is fucking *slow* without a decent card. Machine learning consists of doing the same thing over and over again and Nvidia makes absurdly powerful GPUs for data centers to make this faster.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-15 08:41:04'] If rumors of the 4000 series and AMDs 7000 series turn out to be true then they will be huge power hogs while AMD will be much lower. As a long time PC gamer I can say this gen will be the first that power draw will be a factor in my graphic card buying. My current old and needing replacing gtx1080 draws 200w max and Im not going to replace it with one that takes twice that or more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 20:18:48'] >The idea was that customers don't require the performance increases they are putting out every year. They just want never versions of same performance but more energy efficiency."Yes we do require the performance increases they are putting out every year. And again, there are a number of them in the line. You are actually describing what they do. The 3050 is similar in performance to the 1660 super (3 year old GPU) and the 3050 is recommended 350 watts and the 1660 is recommended 470 watts.Performance increases inherently = power efficiency.Again, if performance increases were linear with wattage no one would be able to run them.Again, customers are idiots. They want the 3090 at 200 watts when that's just not going to be a thing *now*. Eventually they will release the 6060 or something which will be equivalent to the 3090 performance at lower wattage and drain.People want a rocket ship that runs on a AA battery and obviously if that technology existed it would be for sale. Eventually, what we consider to be a rocket ship today will eventually run on a AA battery, but no you can't expect a high end GPU without running it at what it requires for power, obviously.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 21:32:13'] People like OP are exactly why I recommend people mostly stick to investing in companies in which they have a reasonable understanding of  or they themselves utilizes the goods/services of. You don't strike me as either. Any PC enthusiast would understand that Nvidia's customer base would never choose to sacrifice performance over energy efficiency, there is no general market demand for this, and that its GPUs are priced reasonably for what they offer over their competitors (and that pandemic supply/demand heavily impacted their value over the past two years). If you can't bring yourself to better understand Nvidia, don't invest in it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-14 23:48:00'] Anybody who is interested in power savings is going to switch to Apple anyway. Take a look at the test results for the new M1 and M2 machines.

POST_TEXT: b"I have noticed that most people on here are very bullish towards Nvidia even at its current valuation but I haven't seen much talk about how Intel's return to the GPU market will affect Nvidia's valuation and future growth.\n\nIntel has the money and talent especially with Raja Koduri leading the Graphics department to become highly competitive with Nvidia if not a leader in the market. Intel will also have the advantage of using their new fabs in the future to produce their GPU's whereas Nvidia will be reliant on TSMC/Samsung.\n\nWith AMD also becoming more competitive and both Intel and AMD not being as limited to just the GPU market unlike Nvidia, should people be worried that Nvidia may have to lower profit margins and suffer from lower growth that could make their current price look extremely high?\n\nFor disclosure I do own some INTC and would be interested in NVDA if the valuation was more reasonable."
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 13:16:16'] As Intel themselves have said it: don't expect miracles over the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 03:47:14'] Nvidia isn't worried about intel because intel isn't trying to take on the GPU space the same way AMD does. intel wants discrete graphics first then low power consumption stuff mostly for laptops. They won't get any real market share in server or dedicated graphics for a long time. NVDA is still a great buy n hold stock, but if you own it get AMD too. That way, when one falls, the other rises.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 08:46:35'] >Intel has the money **and talent especially with Raja Koduri leading the Graphics department** to become highly competitiveDoubtful.  Intel is hemorrhaging their best employees still.  I live in the Bay Area and 2 of my friends that work at Intel in the graphics division recently moved to AMD.  Also, Raja gets a lot of hate for being a bit of a self-aggrandizer.I highly recommend Blind if you want to get a sense of a company as seen by its employees.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 07:03:45'] Intel won't touch Nvidia on the top end. They *may* scratch at the mid tier if the performance can sway the gamer / hobbyist market but imo, they're just going to raise the bar on the low end. Which Nvidia doesn't really have a stake in. The $500-1000 laptop space rarely has discrete GPU's because people buying those don't prioritize it. Would it be nice to have a dedicated GPU at that price point? Sure. If you're buying a $1500-$2000 laptop you can get a mid-high tier Nvidia GPU which will *probably* out perform the Intel Xe. Most likely Intel's part will be more efficient. Maybe more so in Windows 11. But if you look around, Intel isn't exactly known for their industry leading efficiency. Apple and ARM whip that ass. Intel's new 12th gen CPU set is pretty power hungry too. A lot of factors at play though. Price. Mining performance. Gaming performance. If they can provide NVidia 3060-3080 performance for a significantly lower price point, they'll take a bite out of Nvidia. But, by the time these roll around in 2022... Nvidia will probably be rolling out their 4000 series and mop the floor with everyone again.If Intel comes out with a bang and has RTX 3080 performance for say $499, with abundant inventory, they can definitely make a splash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 12:14:38'] Their chip lineup and video card plans are going to take a while if ever to become competitive across their key competitors in all verticals.    But the companies books look good. Given the "chip" pie is getting bigger, I dont think they need to be king. So even losing market share, I think they can make a profit. Even printing out chips for other companies with their shiny new fabs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 06:49:30'] If anybody underestimates Nvidia they're a fool. Not for tech, but for how vicious and vengeful they are
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 03:43:59'] What games will you be getting an Intel gpu for? I'm in no position to try to make jokes like that. Or maybe it's a valid question. I sold Nvidia a several months ago at a $7K loss when I panic sold during the temporary huge nosedive in the stock. If I had just held on to it I'd be pretty happy about it.I have a Titan RTX btw. The news about Intel's gpus have got me wondering if I could ever possibly switch from my Nvidia gpu to them. Or simply buy a second PC with a future Intel discreet gpu and use both brands.For those not familiar with discreet in this case, a discreet gpu is like a separate powerful gpu (graphics card,) not one built into the motherboard. Correct me if I'm wrong about any of that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 12:24:34'] Nah it's tough to dethrone. Amd was hot on the heels of nvidia and dlss is proving to be superior now. So this year AMD lost. Building fabs that can consistently do 3nm is really difficult. Intel can't get close yet and will need it to compete. Their 7nm isn't going to cut it. Intel was losing the cpu battle last few years vs amd now their latest chips might be enough to fight back a little. If they can unlock some synergies they could give some benefit. No one is clairvoyant, but betting on a challenger who doesn't have the capabilities currently is a long shot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 06:11:22'] I hate Nvidia.They make good products, but they are a shit company with shit practices.[They are forcing their partners to design cheaper shit for the Alchemist computers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-eB6UysSpw)In other words, Nvidia is scared shitless.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 06:33:09'] The model of fabless design + dedicated fab companies beats the combined Intel model.If Intel changes their business model, they lose their (only) advantage and are competing from behind. The later they wait, the worse it becomes.Nvidia on the other hand is transitioning from a combination of semiconductor and software. They're going to be increasing margins.Intel if they change their business model, their margins will drop.If they keep their business model they will keep losing because they're competing against pure play companies. Did you know that just 3 years ago AMD was less than $10 and Intel was $49? Now Intel is $49 and AMD is $155.NVDA was in the $200s pre-split, they would be $1300 nowAlso in 3 years, Intel's profit has declined, and free cash flow will decline further as they invest in CAPEX to catch up.AMD profit has increased more than tenfold, NVDA increased 3-4 fold
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 11:22:35'] I think Intel is undervalued. Given that they're one of the biggest players in the FPGA market.FPGAs are used in tons of industry equipment. Medical, auto, communication, manufacturing, AV, list goes on.FPGAs are going to become only more common in the consumer market. Phones, IoT, appliances.Just a techie, but it's something I personally believe in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 05:33:58'] Nvidia isn't limited to the gpu market they produce arm cpus, and they MIGHT be about to acquire arm. Apples M2 Arm cpu rivals i9 (mobile version i think) while using a lot less power. arm Is far more efficient than the ageing x86 we could see arm dominate the pc desktop market in the future. Nvidias cpu position is really strong if the arm acquisition goes ahead

If adobe puts out it‚Äôs own ai to do photo editing (and logically expands into film, graphic design, and all their other projects), they are shooting themselves in the foot selling fewer licenses to companies employing people to do these things.  If company x can use a highly tuned firefly ai to have 1 editor do the the work of 5, then who loses the sale of 4 subscriptions?  Adobe.  Naturally, I assume adobe will sell firefly subscriptions for a mint to cover the lost licenses but even doubling the subscription price would be a stretch and they‚Äôd likely get pushback from professionals who do not wish to be replaced.  Additionally, putting out a new tool only available by what would have to be a very expensive subscription bars people from learning it.  Adobe student subscriptions have been a loophole for years.  But when students graduate if they can‚Äôt afford licenses for the ai software they‚Äôre used to, they don‚Äôt buy so they either go work at a firm which is already cutting their staff or they pirate it or they find an alternative.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-31 16:59:20'] Nah they'll all tank super hard...Intel makes a very small fraction of the chips that go into modern electronics.  Not to mention intel does a lot of final packaging all over asia that would pretty much shut them down anyway.  It would take the US 5-10 years to even put a dent in the production capacity from asia locally.  And consider it wouldnt be just Taiwan,  you'd have a good chance of the conflict spreading to S Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and/or Japan, at a minimum you'd have embargoes and sanctions flying all over the place.  And honestly that would be the least of our problems, cutting out all that cheap labor for cheap clothing and other retail goods would make our current 8% inflation seem like nothing...

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 04:22:55'] I just cant forsee a conflict. USA has already said it would defend taiwan. War between USA and China would ruin each others countries economically within days. It would also be a stalemate. China's navy is still laughable as far as forward projection and vs the US is concerned. US invading china sounds stupid even as I type it. I think china has to probe to judge whether the US is serious but its not going to happen. As far as Chip stocks are concerned I buy intel from a valuation stance.I love Nvidia and TSMC but they are still a bit over priced imo. Nvidia more than TSMC (TSMC is actually getting pretty close to the price point I want)..

POST_TEXT: b"  \nIonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  \nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities.

This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.  \nYes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.  \nStock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 13:23:04'] It's tough to gauge where Palantir is at. On one hand, their software is pretty incredible and it really seems like there are almost no competitors. If their AIP platform takes off with the commercial side, then I think that will quickly become their central business. On the other hand, the fundamentals of the company on a free cash flow basis support the stock price if you make some very optimistic assumptions. Basically, they have to grow their free cash flow at 16% per year to justify the current price. Moreover, the company is known to issue large amounts of stock based compensation which of course dilutes shareholders. I don't think it would be wise chasing Palantir at these levels  right now. Disclosure: I am long Palantir.

I cant use VR at all because I get vertigo and know many other do. migraines too. so I thought Metaverse was doomed to fail from the get go. Anyway...Google have Deep mind, and have been in the game with powerful AI for a while, what trumped them is public access. ChatGPT was a master stroke in that regard and blew the lid off companies hording "their precious".I am in TQQQ on this, the reason is that AI big bois are propping up the markets but any one of them could take a tumble on a proper game-changing moment from leftfield. Ultimately it's the big names that will own AI, or buy it out, all else will be open source catching up. So open source is the place to look. but...Though its a bit like crapto post 2013, where it was almost impossible to pick winners, but if you threw enough at a bundle, one might moonshot. Its happening fast now , but the difference this time is the AI companies stock is not 0.001 cent, but already at >$200, so no one is jumping in.NVDA should have been predictable obvious one, and I am still seeing lots of investors poo-pooing it saying dont get in now , too expensive. But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. Same with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. my view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.meantime the biggest market yet to be breached imo is home robots. M3gan is the most insightful movie on this. Its way off though, the hype is not the truth with home robots yet. but AI first.

Xilinx is the leader in FPGAs.And $35,000 for a single Nvidia H100 GPU creates alot of incentive for data scientists & corporations to find cheaper alternatives, whether it's through training method or hardware (Founder of ChatGPT says large language models are already being phased out for smaller models that cost factors less).  AI is still in very early stages.  The costs will come down dramatically to the detriment of Nvidia.  In 2007, it cost $10 Million to sequence a human genome; today it costs $200.  For AI to be ubiquitous, the costs have to, and will come down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 11:12:58'] No I would not.I think you bought in Facebook a bit high but I do think the stock will see better days. Especially with the "metaverse" concept becoming trendy. Nvidia is great but I wouldn't sell facebook at a loss for it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 07:48:41'] FB has how many users? I feel their expansion has a limit. Expansion into meta has challenges, like proving they actually care about privacy and social moderation. NVDA is doing what for who?  Making graphics cards & AI for users like FB...  plus...There's more upside in NVDA, but the main question now is *when?*  If it comes 3 yrs from now, will you be satisfied tying up money there for 3 years?I view NVDA like the IBM of the 60s, and FB like the Xerox.. when it was a copier company. Both will reward, but how fast and how much?

So Im going to say, you might want to wait for the ARMs deal to produce something (right now it looks unlikely that NVDA will be able to complete the deal). If they do manage to get the deal through I believe itll rebound. If they dont itll continue its downward trend.

Guidance for Q1 was bleak, stated politely; revenue numbers equivalent to intel in 2012 if I recall correctly. Worse on earnings of course. Neither intel or AMD cared to provide full year guidance. This is because if things followed the trend of Q1 and Q2, its bad. Its okay for AMD, its flat out terrible for INTC. Intel is losing high margin product. Their debt is becoming more expensive. their dividend is deeply gouged and likely ought to disappear altogether. They are losing market share. They are announcing delays to product launches.

Times are dark for many in the space right now, but I'd reckon selling at the bottom or near bottom is probably not the right play. I'd argue there are better places for your capital in the semiconductor space, including the ETFs, but still, I'd at least ride it out a bit longer if you have a longer horizon than, say, a year.

The companies that make chips mostly for gaming systems & computers, idk how likely they are to get funds from this legislation but regardless I‚Äôm surprised it took the EU this long to pass this considering the US jumped on it quickly & we‚Äôre (our politicians at least) notorious for making issues out of non-issues.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 21:53:04'] Welcome to the hype cycle.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:44:59'] So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.The truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.I would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?The answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.In the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.Which brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.In 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s...

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 01:10:51'] Most of the 3d printing stocks I am interested in are companies that are still private. I would really like to get in on some 3d printed housing companies like ICON. I think for 3d printing in general, it might be too late to jump on that bandwagon. But if you find markets like housing where 3d printing could actually revolutionized the way things are done, it can be a nice investment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 02:47:27'] URNM for green energy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 03:49:25'] As already mentioned in this thread be aware of the hype cycles surrounding these topics!Apple has been rather low-key about AI but they are very serious about it I think. Mostly so to create an AI that can understand the user‚Äôs surroundings and can be used in both AR glasses and autonomous vehicles. Tim Cook himself has mentioned they see this as their hardest problem, but one they intent to solve. Other than that AAPL in general is a great stock to own.W.r.t. green energy I‚Äôd recommend Fluence (FLNC), which is a global leader in utility battery energy storage. The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play.

Its essentially a clean and portable way to power large projects. The company claims the Zinc batteries are much more efficient than lithium powered ones. In the past few months a few large hedge funds have moved in. Particularly Point72, steve cohens fund. He owns 7% of the company now and I see it moving higher eventually. It seems like a good company and I can understand what its goal is. Current price is 1.85. Experts have a low target of 3.00 (+62%), an average target of 3.25 (75%) and a high target of 11.00 (+494%). What do you think? Heres their website https://www.eose.com

Could just consider doubling that position, seeing as Tesla has and will continue to have by far the biggest market share in energy storage and probably AI/software energy (re)distribution too with AutoBidder and VPPs, both of which are way more important than energy generation for a green energy future, since solar and wind are pretty commoditized.

Picking individual titles of distruptive technologies is high risk gambling.Algonquin just cut their dividends by 40% and lost more than 50% in valuation. Investors left the boat en masse Be careful. I only have a tiny position so I'm keeping mine, still making decent dividends and I'm sure they'll bounce back in the next 20 years (my horizon).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 10:50:30'] My approach to AI stocks is a "Picks and Axes" approach. I have money in Nvidia, since their cards are almost always used in top-end computers. I have money with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft because many AI programs use cloud storage as a means to keep the data that they supply the AI models.Which company will best monetize AI? I don't know. Will they use an Nvidia graphics card and cloud-based information storage? I believe so.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 11:26:54'] I'm in both Algonquin and Brookfield.  Algonquin has a tougher slog ahead given that they're targeting traditional poles and wires investments and they've recently been denied their merger with Kentucky Power and reduced their dividend. Their capital will be quite costly in this interest rate environment so at this point, I'm not sure how they can deliver above market returns. But I'm sticking with it because I'm already in the green since I bought post-dividend cut and perhaps they will surprise us with something strategically special. If not, I'll just keep collecting the half-decent divvy and hope for slow gains.Brookfield has a narrow but solid strategy. They have a decent asset growth plan and have access to relatively cheap capital through Brookfield parent. They know how to manage merchant power assets and with the knowledge they are building on the renewable side, I think they will provide decent long term returns (but no crazy beta) over other merchant generators.I'm also in MSFT and AMZN but don't have any special insights/theses that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere.

I have a good number of shares at 78.Lots of small companies have been on a downcycle recently, so their stock performance isnt great. For the buy low sell high mantra, things are not looking horrific however. For green tech,I like RIO under 60, copper and rare earths. For more risky/speculative, I like TLGRF (battery anode + mining) at $1.00 usd or lower, which it is roughly at now. and I think something for the watch list is PYR; they might go through a reverse split in the next 6 months. if that happens, once the dust settles I will have to go in. There is no rush. I do not see the next 2 months as good for the market. I recommend waiting or DCA, and only after doing your own DD. These are ideas that I like. Two safe ones, and two risky ones.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 20:35:17'] I think we are in, how do you say, a bubble but a bubble with many smaller bubbles within in it. Sort of like a large bubble encasing many smaller ones. Anyone of these bubbles popping could cause a contagion effect. What is concerning is the fact this economy has been injected with cash from the actions due to the pandemic. Was injecting cash a good thing? Eh, hindsight is 20/20..am I right? Rhetorical of course, we simply don‚Äôt 100% know. I do know many folks and businesses alike are using these funds, wages and savings to push up the market all while collecting money from these investments. Might be an explanation to where some of the missing work force went. It‚Äôs very interesting using analytics and techniques to review market data but it‚Äôs human behavior at the core. Right now everyone who has skin in the game are at best trying to find what will pop first. With so much fear and confusion it‚Äôs like the fed thinks we need something familiar to happen in the market to know which way is up. IMO not gonna happen. This inflation is going to stick. Why? Too much money chasing too few goods. Slap the working force and unemployment goes up. Thing is, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the working class with the money. So I see high unemployment and moderate inflation 4-5%, but a big demand in growth for services. So I‚Äôll call it Flowflation. Ew, how do we get out of this? Policy to detach from energy costs and dare I say it drop interest rates and some how get the rich closer to us in terms of income.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:20:32'] The problem is that we are in a market that does not understand reality of economics anymore. It is a pure gambling machine based on technical analysis. https://talkmarkets.com/content/nasdaq-bitcoin-gold-among-beneficiaries-of-falling-rates-expectations?post=389768This is an article that sends shivers down my spine. First this part:"The market is thus betting that we have reached a peak in terms of rate hikes and that from here looser monetary policy should follow.The Fed, SNB, and BoE all hikes interest rates this week, but the message from these banks was the same: more increases may be required, not will be if inflationary pressures persist."Where on earth are people getting this idea? The Fed is doing something rather clever. They are providing liquidity at ever increasing rates. Meaning you can have money, but it will cost you. They are completely misunderstanding looser monetary policy.Secondly, the idea that you can read the market as an uptrend because of some technical analysis is ludicrous. Technical analysis works until it does not work, and then it does not work really badly. People have since 2008 only seen a market that goes up. That is scary as it implies we have a generation of "investors" that don't understand that markets can go down hard.It will burst, but it will be death by a thousand cuts.

The valuation of the market is fundamentally reasonable as it is backed by earnings. A 'bubble' occurs when an asset is being bid up by speculation and becomes detached from fundamentals. That is not the case here. Some argue future earnings will go down. Maybe. But where we are right now is not a bubble

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 16:01:05'] We‚Äôre still in the post Covid bubble. Prices have drawn back, but still well over valued, especially tech stocks. Add that to all the other problems we‚Äôre looking down the barrel at, and you have a perfect storm that could lead to another Great Depression level stock market crash. That of course would build in its self due to the number of people who are counting on the stock market or retirements.If your under 40, I wouldn‚Äôt count on either social security, or a 401k for retirement. Neither will be around much longer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 00:48:49'] As a non-US based in investor I think it would help US investors to look at things from the formers perspective to get a better idea of what‚Äôs happening. A lot US stocks are flat / down despite the run up in USD terms since the USD has weakened quite a lot over the past few months.As a EUR investor, the only thing that‚Äôs really ballooned again is tech when factoring in FX rates movements, and it seems to more based of potential changes in interest rate policy rather than fundamentals, because the fundamentals (both individual company & macro) aren‚Äôt trending amazingly well. My personal view is certain parts of the tech sector: APPL, MSFT etc‚Ä¶have taken in a lot of sideline cash in anticipation of rate pauses (or even cuts) and are currently overvalued. Great companies but not at a fair price. I had a big bag of MSFT, sold 60% this week. The rest of my holding is house money so happy to ride it out incase I‚Äôm wrong, but I think there‚Äôs more downside for tech in the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 20:29:20'] A correction and being down are two different things.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 04:03:33'] Tech companies have very good cash flows, but their potential growth **is already priced in**.They also face tough competition in many departments and the barrier of entry for competitors is low.If you're looking for good investment opportunities, looking at literally where everyone's looking and putting their money on is a double edged sword.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:41:31'] NVIDIA: Driven by AI bubbleApple: Probably because it is viewed as the safe haven for blue chips, and is continuously bought by 401ks and other retirement and hedge funds.Microsoft: A combination of AI hype and following apple, I'd imagineAmazon: Still down because amazon has flipped to losing money. All the other 3 tech stocks above are still making money hand over fist.META: Meta-verse cash burn fears seem to still be prevalent. if META dropped their metaverse plan, I think the stock could rise substantially from current levels, also could partly be recession ad-spending fearsGoogle: Recession ad-spending fears Tesla: Very hard to properly value, margin fears, PE ratio would argue that it still could be overvalued even at current suppressed prices. I think their valuation is heavily tied to future FSD success. If tesla actually pulls through and completes FSD, they are very undervalued at current prices

Indications show all these FAANG tech stocks will stay at this level or have more room to fall more.Back in 2020 the Feds basically forgot to charge interest so borrowing was free.

Tesla has fantastic and very forward looking leadership that made a very long term plan to start with very high end EVs, and bring the costs down overtime to sell much more volume to many more consumers. Just last year Tesla's Model Y became the 4th best selling vehicle in the world, and Tesla is projecting it to become the number one best selling vehicle globally.Despite whatever contraversial things Elon might say it doesn't change the fact that Tesla's leadership has been an unquestionable success for any long term shareholders.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 20:34:11'] Satya Nadella. Sure every tech company for the most part experienced a boom the last few years but he's directed MS into a sustainable position and a powerhouse in sectors such as cloud, and AI.CEOs like Jensen and Elon road what seemed like dependent roads to success. Crypto-mining booming Nvidia profits (yes their data center presence is very strong), and Elon taking Tesla to the moon through memes and hype which has since came down.

Reality is market just want to see abysmal Ballmer out as his last 5 years were total debacle. Satya has lot going and he did made some good decisions but lately he screwed up too. The way he executed layoffs is terrible. All employees are playing musical chair every day until March to see who is not laid off. He never able to revive mobile, lost big on AR, and I don‚Äôt know about other folks but bing still sucks. We don‚Äôt need bing. ChatGPT v4 and above can integrate with any UX and will work so not sure why bing need to be lump up with it. m365, GitHun and LinkedIn are much better prospect for ChatGPT integration. I think Sundar is downright poor CEO. He is basically Indian version of Ballmer. He became too complicit and results are infront of us.As much I hate to admit, Apple CEO Tim Cook is one the better in FAANG.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 00:28:55'] LOL at Tim Cook, he literally did nothing. Apple is all brand and it became so because of Steve Jobs and a good marketing campaign in the past. Revenue growth is less than inflation meaning that the company is losing money YoY without accounting for inflation.There are plenty of great CEOs that made incredible turnarounds, this sub only focus on the most well known companies, some of which have such powerful brands that don't require a great CEO to maintain their market position.Google CEO is also terrible. They literally didn't innovate at all, it's still just the search engine. All attempts to diversify were huge failures. Google Cloud is a joke. Youtube is just a good acquisition but that's all.Zuckemberg is losing money with that stupid metaverse and he's such a big weirdo and nutcase. He also allowed TikTok to take over their core business despite enjoying huge benefits as a monopolist in the sector with high switching costs.Amazon still didn't find a way to have decent margins on their e-commerce business despite the fact they had almost a monopoly for over a decade and it's been 30 years that the e-commerce platform has been created. And. AWS is slowing down.Nvidia is a meme stock nowadays that was extremely lucky to ride the crypto boom. What merit the CEO has to just be lucky enough to sell the GPUs that then found an application for mining coins? Just luck, they didn't create the GPU because of crypto, they produced them for a completetely different segment. Revenues have pummeled and people that praise it didn't even look at the balance sheet. I'll argue with anybody on here who tell me that Nvidia balance sheet is in good shape. In May 2022  they reported revenues of 8,3 billions....in October 2022 revenues 5,9 billions...they literally collapsed despite the inflation.May 2022 EBITDA 3,55 billions, Jun 2022 EBITDA 770 millions....LOLThis sub is just an echo chamber that parrot back what others say.In the real world, it's not even questionable that Elon is the greatest. Nobody has his track record. He made Tesla a powerhouse, he created SpaceX, he created The Boring Company, created NeuraLink, created StarLink, created OpenAI, created Paypal, ecc.Only clueless Elon Musk haters and trolls can put him behind the other Tech Ceo who literally did nothing and only maintained market positions thanks to huge and powerful brands that they inherited (they didn't create it).

Most importantly nvidia graphics cards are for whatever reason mostly incompatible with my preferred Linux flavor. I also believe while they are the cards that come integrated into a lot of laptops, AMD produces higher quality product. I was buying last year both. And I had a strong conviction that nvidia was overvalued and clearly even more so now even with the supply chain issues and my thoughts about amd were the opposite. I think AMD is a long way to go before reaching their peak.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 11:15:29'] Insurance is paper intensive, or it was 35 years ago. Back then, I worked for a company that outsourced work from insurance companies. My expertise was in back offices and computer automation. Actually, no one was an expert back then because we were just figuring out what it meant. Technology challenges were definitely a factor in those days.I have been retired for a decade by then, most of the low fruit has been harvested.  Forms are standardized, and data are scraped from them and jammed into legacy back end systems,  eliminating the data entry that occurred before. Obviously the internet changed that problem too. By the time I retired,  Gartner had coined the term "Business Process Management." Insurance companies were quick to adopt.  At its heart, there were rules engines, either procedural or AI, during the process flow of work. How much will the current versions of AI change things vs. what was already available to the enterprise is yet to be seen. Visions of underwriters disappearing may be overreaching? Or not.  If the past is an indication of the future, it will be a niche solution for a long time, and it will be slow to create shareowner value. Integrators or outsourcers may get a piece of the technology dollars, too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 14:56:54'] So obviously I asked chatGPT your question since it has first hand experience :) This is the answer:There are several industries that stand to benefit significantly from cost savings due to AI advancements. Here are some of the most promising:1. Healthcare: AI can help reduce costs in healthcare by streamlining administrative tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and predicting patient outcomes.2. Manufacturing: AI can optimize manufacturing processes by predicting maintenance needs, reducing downtime, and increasing production efficiency.3. Retail: AI can help retailers optimize inventory management, reduce waste, and personalize customer experiences, leading to increased sales and cost savings.4. Banking and finance: AI can help banks and financial institutions automate routine tasks, detect fraudulent activity, and optimize investment strategies.5. Transportation: AI can optimize transportation networks, reduce fuel consumption, and improve logistics, leading to significant cost savings for both shippers and carriers.Overall, the potential cost savings from AI are significant and span across many industries. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more industries benefiting from its advancements.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 12:23:59'] Insurance is one of the least likely to be replaced by AI. Claims processing and underwriting could perhaps be largely automated, but not actuarial sciences.

The machine learning that most refer to are black box. Ask this question on r/ actuary for more clarity.

POST: ['2020-05-17 13:52:55'] POST TITLE: b'NVidia  Know What You Own'
POST_TEXT: b'How many people really understand what theyre buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive in the future, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With whats been going on in markets, I dont like my chances but here goes:\n\nLets start with\n\n**How does NVDA make money?**\n\nNVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer  generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.\n\nSimply put, NVDAs profits represent the difference be'

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 17:08:03'] Anyone else notice a pattern while reading this?  Every time NVDA seems to be in trouble and at risk from competition...a new use case emerges for which their tech is very useful.  Gaming...Crypo..Machine learning.  Ever think maybe they are just a high quality company capable of adapting quickly to meet current market demands?
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 16:41:00'] What you are missing is NVDA's economic moat in the machine learning world. All the software runs on CUDA. The software stack that enables the AI revolution is what is going to put NVDA products in every data center for the ongoing future.I am a machine learning engineer and everything I use runs on CUDA. Being the backbone behind the AI revolution over the next 10 years is going to be extremely profitable for NVDA, just like the Windows OS made Microsoft the biggest home computer company, and iOS made Apple the biggest phone company.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 14:27:15'] OP does this mean you think foundries like TSMC are a better play for people who want to invest in the semiconductor/chip making industry? Since barrier to entry is high for manufacturers (I think), and TSMC makes most of AMD and NVidia's chips they should be in a good spot for years to come, right?
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 16:07:14'] I don't think you'll have a lot of companies left if you calculate them all this way.Nvidia over Intel every day though.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 15:44:56'] This is a post worth the read. Would love to see more like it. Makes a nice change from "should I buy airline/cruise stocks? They're really cheap right now".Ironic that people talk about investing in tech giants like Google yet seem unable to use it themselves.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 15:20:51'] Yea I always thought Nvidia is expensive. But i think whats even more expensive is Shopify.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 17:02:36'] Betting against hyper-growth stocks, even (if not especially) those that trade at crazy prices, is extremely tough and risky. These companies are often trading on a story. For better or for worse, sound financial analysis based on reasonable assumptions of future cash flows don‚Äôt necessarily matter for these stock prices. I would caution anyone from shorting a successful story‚Äîjust look at the the TSLA bears who continue to get burned. I made money on NVDA and TSLA in the past. The toughest part is knowing when to jump off the train (if ever). I‚Äôm long INTC and I think that‚Äôs a great value play. It‚Äôs a defensible business with great profit margins. Somehow it trades pretty cheaply.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 17:00:35'] I stopped reading after you tried to claim that integrated graphics processor from 2012 could run modern games the same as an Nvidia GPU. I‚Äôve can‚Äôt even use my intel i7 with integrated graphics on a 15 y/o game. Games are getting more power hungry as graphics improve. The only area where the gaming industry is reducing the load on PC‚Äôs is offloading some processing to cloud computers - and guess what? - Nvidia supplies the units for that too. Moore‚Äôs law is approaching its end and we can‚Äôt cram any more power into CPU‚Äôs. This is why processing units like Nvidia‚Äôs are the future. Nvidia is far in the lead.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 19:04:55'] I'm really not convinced in your analysis. There's a lot of pointing at Tesla sales being "too far" which is a statement that requires almost more analysis than this entire post. Second, you are negotiating that their deep learning segment is not as robust as people think. Who cares? This is not a core business whatsoever. It's like BMW offering station wagons saying station wagons aren't all the hype. Lastly, you didn‚Äôt mention the recent acquisition they made which is going to make their production more efficient by a decent a margin. Other than that, I can‚Äôt speak to much of the rest of your analysis, still great job. There‚Äôs a lot of useful information in here.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 14:11:49'] Can someone sum this up in a paragraph pls
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 18:07:16'] This is a great post. However, I disagree. A few things 1st: Total net income for trailing 12 months is $2.8b giving us a 4.52 EPS. Over the next 12 months, they're projected to double that to 9.33 EPS. Thus forward p/e ratio is only 36. The company has very little debt and pays a small dividend. This is exactly the type of company long-term stable investors look for. This is cheap for a growth stock. Not a growth stock you ask?AI is just getting started. Tesla will be fine. A few startups to keep your eye for future partnership and or acquisitions:[https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/how-ai-chips-will-explode-3x-by-2025-startups-like-hailo-syntiant-and-groq](https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/how-ai-chips-will-explode-3x-by-2025-startups-like-hailo-syntiant-and-groq) Gaming will continue to grow. Nvidia holds 72% of this market and growing.

A company that expects sales to slow, does not give raises during a pandemic.

The trend is your friend.NVDA May 29th $385 calls for the earnings gamble and January 2021 $400 calls for the stable growth play. Good Luck.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 17:20:35'] TLDR: Nvidia has been leading the way in consumer-grade PC graphics cards. The ones we play Fortnite with for about 5+ years without any rebuttle from their only competitor, AMD. Although AMD has been making strides overall as a company, only rivals Nvidia in one segment of grpahics cards, the budget-low end. Nvidia's long standing as the goliath in the market, secured them other opportunities like enterprise scale super computers that are in Universities and other places that need super computing. AMD's budget cards, although "good enough", secured them deals with Microsoft and their consoles.  Lets talk future: Nvidia's next gen launch is going to showcase the full capabilites this architecture was designed for. Nvidia will lead, again, in the enterprise and consumer sector with these graphic cards. AMD has a launch too, but they are still a generation behind as their best GPU, 5700XT is weaker than Nvidia's by 4 cards. (I gave you AMD boys the 1080TI, so RTX 2080 and up). With Mixed/Virual Reality, Content Creation, and Streaming on the highest incline, we can accurately speculate that this launch will be successful.&#x200B;TLSDR: If you have any thoughts of buying NVDA, do it now and not when its over $400. Selling all my positions of $T and dumping into NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 17:26:47'] NVidia is also entering the game streaming market. Product is much better than Google's Stadia, for sure.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 16:42:12'] "That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339"Very insightful technical analysis of NVDA. To say that the share price is worth $49 would put it around pre-2016 levels before the crypto boom. Going from 6566 employees to over 11k employees (2018) means they are doing something right. Along with the recent Mellanox/Cumulus acquisitions, this would definitely place the stock price at least much higher than their 2016 levels. Keep in mind that the company is founder led by (IMO) one of the top CEOs in American history for over 27 years. It is hard to deny that AI/HPC/gaming will only evolve and grow in the future so the share price today reflects that sentiment. Only time will tell if NVDA is worth the price it is today. But $49 on a 30b market cap valuation is just simply ridiculously low.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 15:35:32'] Everything in your post checks out. But when do you think the ball will drop? Semiconductor valuations and that of broader tech seem to have anti gravity devices equipped on them for the last 20 years
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-18 09:47:12'] I cannot believe you spent a few hours writing a post just to advise people to sell NVidia because it's very expensive in your opinion. Ironically, your opinion is different from most market analysts who are suggesting that NVidia is still a buy as it has room to further grow.I own NVidia stocks and am long on it, and I am glad I didn't spend much time reading your post but just read the last paragraph.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 15:15:41'] Ppl who are long NVDA just keep that in mind that for last 5 years NVDA had no competition in the high and highest end market. Just like Intel had no competition in most markets pre Ryzen era.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-18 06:15:01'] Well this aged well...another round of nvda upgrades. Bro, you‚Äôre fighting the wrong fight. Ive watched bears like you short NVDA for the last 5 years. NVDA might be overvalued, but many people think Nvidia‚Äôs gaming revenue and data center revenue is going to continue to grow fast and consistently. Shorting this stock is suicide
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-18 13:28:10'] I don't want to sound like a prick, but I have to say that OP's view on machine learning / AI is very superficial and non-technical. My educated guess is that OP is probably a BI analyst or Data scientist, who is more familiar with R, SQL, Tableau, than Tensorflow, cuda, or python in general.I am a ML engineer myself and I can say that the whole AI/ ML area will just vanish now if without Nvidia. We rely heavily heavily heavily on CUDA, tensorflow, pytorch, etc. None of them can steadily run on AMD graphics card. Everyone on my team has a company desktop top with at least one top notch Nvidia GPU for develop. For actual training, we have company-wide ML clould with hundreds if not thousands Nvidia Tesla cards. Will this be changed? Yes probably when specialized AI chips (e.g Google TPU) is a thing. or when the next non-neural network ML model is invented, which requires a huge paradigm shift in AI research, and I don't think that will happen in the next 5-10 years.Also AI/ML IS BIG now, and it will become bigger.All these being said, I don't have any NVDA stock now (sold all my postions late 2018). I am heavy on AMD.  IMO NVDA is good, but I just feel AMD has more growth potential.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 15:22:06'] This is a great post. You should consider a career in Equity Research (if you‚Äôre not in it already)
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 15:05:38'] Thanks man. Very thorough. Quite an eye opener. People don't seem to like it though.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 16:47:44'] Good write up.I‚Äôve been sitting on 10+ shares of NVDA (most I bought out of college). I bought more of AMD and INTC. 9-12 months ago, I stopped pumping money into NVDA and started putting them into AMD and INTC. As a gamer and photographer, I was really impressed with the price/performance of first gen Ryzen CPUs. I‚Äôve been really impressed with their recent GPUs. While I‚Äôm weary of the valuation of AMD and the overall market right now, I‚Äôm a lot more scared of putting more money into NVDA.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 15:25:56'] Nice read, thanks. As an Industrial Engineering graduate, I was shocked when I learned about the technical side of the ML, DL last year. Like that‚Äôs what you‚Äôll hyping up for the last 4-5 years?? I thought there were some crazy newly found algorithms.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 16:45:23'] Great post. Very detailed and well written. Your analysis is very interesting and seems correct to me - I haven‚Äôt looked much into nvda myself but I‚Äôve been aware of people praising it. I wish posts like these were the rule and not an exception.

They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs.Wrong and wrong.>	3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. 3DFX died because they failed to adapt to a market with live competition. Their greatest strength, Glide, became their greatest weakness when both the gaming industry and the GPU industry focused on DirectX and OpenGL.As a gamer back then, the choice was obvious. The final nails in 3dfx‚Äôs coffin were the reasons above, but they fucked themselves into a corner long before.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-18 03:51:55'] Nvidia still has high demand for their GPU's. They sell out even without mining and high price tag. A lot of people will be investing in powerful desktop workspaces for home due to coronavirus. The shift to remote work is going to be the outlier here. You won't be able to get a job without a fast or capable computer. So nvidia will have strong demand from both professional and gaming markets for their cards at all price points. Xbox and ps5 will fail at launch this year, due to the supply chains being effected and consumer spending. Sony and Microsoft are all shifting to cloud based gaming anyways, so the only console maker after this new line will be nintendo going forward. Nvidia is already in cloud based gaming with shield.I do not see nvidia losing market share because to be frankly honest, amd is not competitive yet. The features nvidia gives and the stability it provides is vastly ahead of amd at the moment. Maybe, rdna2 by amd will show us something new but I doubt it, after seeing the xbox and ps5 demos.  It's not overvalued and is still bull because there is no proven competition yet. They still command the market.

Nvidia is right in the middle of all of the major technology breakthrough trends (Machine Learning, FSD, AI, etc.) so it will continue to have a premium attached to its book value.Additionally, many expect the earnings to be good due to high demand for GPU due to stay at home increased video game playing.Bottom line, you might get hammered if you short, short-squeezes are a real thing.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 17:28:15'] While you question that such ‚Äúunlikely and positive events‚Äù have been extrapolated by current investors, your assumptions that the probability of those happening again is zero is extremely conservative and leading to your valuation bias. You did not provide a legitimate argument why revenue from Tesla will flatten when the whole world thing they will increase exponentially. Lastly, why couldn‚Äôt they attract similar business prospects over the next few years? You‚Äôre assuming that management (which has shown superb business acumen so far) is just going to sit in its hands. You may have the background of semiconductor companies sorted but your forecast is novice at best.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-17 21:00:25'] Nvidia already showed weakness last year. In fact the company may have reached his potential growth for the next 5 years. So you could expect big up and down for the stock. It is way overevaluated atm with a fair value at around 100.The price changes is not about you but about the whole investors pool, and if they keep getting disappointed by the company, this will lose a lot of its value over time. For now I beleive nvidia reached his almost full potential. You just need to look at the numbers for the past quarters, which is enough to scare new investors away.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-07 14:37:55'] ARM acquisition not going through was already priced in.In the recent ER Jensen was also not very hopeful. He kind of dodged it and the sentiment is long going on due to UK blocking and now US blocking. Multiple analysts who gave prices targets of $350 or $400 also added clearly that their price recommendation was based on ARM deal not happening.It is not a surprise in any way. NVDA is not gonna go down. Maybe for you it was a shocker but UK blocked the ARM thing almost 2 months back. US just followed it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-27 02:58:16'] Frankly, I'd put my money on AMD taking another slice out of Nvidia here in a month or two when they drop their next gen graphics cards. Their silicone process produces higher quantities of higher quality, more energy efficient components at a lower error rate.And while AMD has a bit of a reputation for rough GPU launches, they've steadily increased their professionalism and have hit several home runs with their CPU and the 5000 series GPU, not to mention their hardware presence on all the upcoming gaming consoles. With this, their hardware will set the standard for what type of architecture most games are programmed on. Games will be programmed to have their most functionality on AMD hardware. I think AMD is better positioned to be the leader in gaming graphics this generation, and has plenty of room for growth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 05:50:39'] That's to reduce inventory, not (only) to keep prices high. They had a huge increase in inventory, so it would be useless to keep accumulating chips or  selling them for a low price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 14:01:26'] Under ship means ship less than is purchased, but because of excess inventory already on the market, not a nefarious effort to keep prices high. Other chip makers would happily take AMD‚Äôs market share if they deliberately reduced their own supply.

That's not a Microcenter-paid promotion, it's confirmed to be AMD. How does one reconcile that with the author's implied narrative of "keeping prices high?"AMD has the unique ability to redirect chiplets between PC and server CPUs depending on demand. Undershipping one to meet demand on the other doesn't mean it's anti-consumer.

It allows us to compare the companys average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\n\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companys shares.\n\nSo we have nvidias equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billion'

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 23:08:24'] Since growth stocks often trade at higher ratios, a helpful indicator in order to find out whether investors are pricing in just growth (as it should be) or also euphoria is the historical PE ratio.The current PE ratio for NVDA is about 80. In the last 10 years the minimum was 12.79, the median 31.09 and the maximum 96.39. For the PE ratio to get back to median value there are two possibilities, either the company grows faster than expected (quite difficult since a generous growth has already been priced in) or the share price falls.Hope I give you another perspective on the NVDA valuation!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 07:22:20'] Here is my constructive feedback and saying this all in a nice way. Half your analysis is explaining EBITDA and other metrics. People can Google what EBITDA is and how it‚Äôs calculated if they don‚Äôt know. It made your write up longer than it needed to be. Also, you flip flop back and forth in numbers (billions and millions). I don‚Äôt think NVidia has 19782 billion is cash, I think you are missing a period after the 9 maybe. Also, use commas (or a space depending on where you are located in the world) between thousands (19,782 for instance). It‚Äôs so difficult to quickly understand the number without commas. Sorry to harp so much on format, but if format is no good people will not respect the content of your analysis. Another example is when you say Nvidea 5 year growth is 1.401%. I assume you mean 1,401%. Any analysis you post publicly should be much tighter formatting/reviewed. Good luck in your investing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 01:40:13'] Nice work, what i am missing in DD to be complete is a bear case and company's strength, regardless of price. Let me illustrate with an example -- we know that GPU market aint going nowhere, but the field I see NVDA in is also AI -- they have actually an amazing research team, and deep learning is almost exclusively run on nvda gpus (by retail) -- there could be possible margins there aswell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 22:58:40'] I don't quite understand why people compare valuation ratios with the industry average. Isn't it possible the entire sector is in a bubble? This is a genuine question. I would appreciate an answer.GPU crypto mining is more likely to die out than to grow. As far as I know, no new crypto project uses Proof of Work. That leaves us with Bitcoin and its cousins. If Bitcoin succeeds, mining difficulty will ratchet up and GPUs will not even be considered for mining. If Bitcoin fails, no one will want to mine anyway. And already, most of network's hashing power comes from ASIC rigs, if I'm not mistaken.For gaming, NVIDIA does have a pretty good moat in PC gaming, eventhough they have lost the consoles to AMD for now. And AMD is closing in. But, I think the bigger threat is a good game streaming service. If Google Stadia or a hypothetical Apple service becomes good, which I think is highly likely, they won't have any trouble catching a userbase, given their extensive ecosystem. While GeForce Now might be a good subscription model for NVIDIA, IMO it'll be difficult for it to compete against a service that comes with an entrenched ecosystem. While it is possible that NVIDIA chips power those game streaming services, it is also possible that they don't. With AMD closing in, and the larger trend of companies designing their own chips, no telling how that might go.I welcome critical comments.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-09 10:25:10'] >Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn‚Äôt as black and white, but that‚Äôs the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.In the short amount of time, e.g. daily trading, human psychology may convert or is more or less unanimous. And that can be captured neatly in a stock's price.But stock price is one dimensional.  Over a long period of time, the psychology on why someone or some institution buys or sells a stock becomes complicated.   The one dimensional stock price cannot possibly capture the psychology behind buying and selling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 06:00:23'] My critique of this DD is that it is not finished! You have done a great job at what you've done so far, and it's a really good base to perform a more thorough valuation, but there is more digging to be had here. The most important thing is trying to figure out how much money you think the business will make over time. It doesn't have to be 100% accurate, but there should always be a rough idea of how much you expect them to make. When you do this, it's important to factor in the risk of the business going under or being outcompeted (make sure you discount that from how much money you expect them to make). Also it's really important to understand how their business works. Personally, I know nothing about tech, but this could be a great play for someone who understands the industry better than me. Basically I think you've done a great job here, but you have more work to do! What I'd recommend you do from here is skim more quarterly and annual reports to see how they work on the more minute levels. Anyhow, you're doing amazing, keep up the good work! (:

Plus, strip clubs and casinos are packed and that's even with all the strippers making tons more from reels and onlyfans. Besides that, the NASDAQ went down 30% in 2022 and even after going down that much it was still up massively for the decade. So, the 30% down vision you have is still a bubble from when other people were screaming the same song over the last 30 years. Crashes aren't really crashes when they never crash down to levels seen in the prior crash. The NASDAQ is up so much since the 1990's it's crazy. All while having wars, shootings, and all the nonsense bears say will produce a crash. Wrong for too long equals wrong forever.

Initially, I invested in AMD back in 2016, primarily because it was more affordable compared to Intel, and I happened to get lucky. In 2018, I added NVIDIA to my portfolio as I had a deep interest in gaming and GPU/computer building. In 2020, I purchased an Oculus device, which allowed me to glimpse into an untapped future. Interestingly, Facebook, now META, has emerged as a dominant player in this space. It's possible that they will enjoy several years of success, much like Intel did in 2016.\r  \n\r  \nRecently, I discovered Roblox, a company that shares my vision and embodies how I envision the true metaverse operating.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 05:52:57'] Meta will have nothing to do with the metaverse. Roblox will remain a kids game. Neither will have any future in "the metaverse" because they aren't doing the technology that will actually drive people to the metaverse and out of the games there currently are.Roblox may be its own version of what could be considered a metaverse just like Fortnite and Minecraft but they lack the ability to go outside of their own game, the ability to take items out of certain games and into others is what will drive popularity along with being able to sell those items to other players. Decentralization is the way, none of the current infrastructure for any of these games incorporate this ability.There are few public companies that are pushing for this reality and building it. Anything less will just be what we already have and will not be disruptive or innovative.

Their margin are ok, but won't grow endlessly, as they need high investments to keep their edge.They are mature and dominate their market, so the only source of growth would be market expansion. Which means the market has to grow by a factor of 10 for them to be reasonably priced at the same margin.So I would ask anybody investing in NVDA 2 questions:1. which price do would you consider a fair value?2.

What I mean is semi conductor companies might not really want to establish too many fabs to influx the market with millions of chips it will not help them.Just buy AMD and NVDA and hold ...

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 21:52:34'] It's not a very smart product IMO. If I needed to deploy an NN (let's be real, that's the bulk of AI today), I'd rather use a product like AWS/GCP/Azure. Cloudflares's restrictions to their serverless tech (Workers) is simultaneously their greatest strength and their biggest weakness, making it next to useless to deploy ML. So Nvidia will have to rely on some server based tech (they claim A100 GPUs), which renders Cloudflare's Workers tech redundant at this point. If they do extend support to Tensorflow, they now need to rely on a C++ compiler as well, which takes away the biggest benefit (extremely fast cold start times) since you can no longer use a V8 isolate for an ML worker.Tl;dr: Current cloudflare tech isn't built for AI. If they evolve the tech, they lose the biggest benefit of the product.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 11:25:20'] I bought Cloudflare when it IPO‚Äôd simply because I‚Äôve been using their products for years and absolutely love them. This is great news for me as a customer and as an investor

That‚Äôs not even considering their AI and servers which is what really has the investors drooling over.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 22:04:28'] Nvidia may acquire ARM in the next couple weeks. I think that is causing the stock to rocket a bit
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 02:47:57']  I saw the live event yesterday, there wasn't really anything surprising. Gains were nice, above average, but it's semiconductor, 2x gains every 2 years is the norm, that's Moore's law for you. It does look like a solid generation though, some of the rendered videos they showed looked absolutely stunning, Ray tracing will really take us to completely photo-realistic computer generated videos. The eye works on ray tracing (photons hitting the retina) so it should work.Biggest issue I had was the announcement that the cards were fabbed on Samsung 8nm "Nvidia custom node".I don't really like this, that's a really old ass node. Samsung 8nm is really just Samsung 10nm with a new coat of paint. About 15% logic density over 10 nm, with maybe 5-8% performance gain.It's hard to compare logic nodes between manufacturers, performance is very hard, but for transistor density this chart is good,[https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm\_vs\_10nm\_vs\_12nm\_vs\_14nm\_Transistor\_Densities](https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm_vs_10nm_vs_12nm_vs_14nm_Transistor_Densities)RTX 2000-series was on TSMC 12 nm with 34 million transistors per mm\^2, Samsung 8nm is 61.2 MTr /mm\^2. It's a nice 80% density gain, but it's like really fucking old stuff. Smartphone were getting fabbed on TSMC 10 nm (comparable to Samsung 8nm), in 2017 with the Snapdragon 845 (thing that goes in all flagship android phones).In 2018 Snapdragon 855 was on 7nm.In 2019 Snapdragon 865 was on "advanced 7nm" N7P, about a 15% performance gain.In 2020 Apple will launch the next iPhone on TSMC‚Äôs 5nm EUV in a couple weeks.TSMC 5nm has a transistor density of 171.3 MTr /mm\^2, destroying Samsung 8nm @ 61.2 MTr /mm\^2. Being around 2.8x more dense and \~140% more performance per watt.Nvidia seems to be on lukewarm terms with TSMC, while TSMC's new best friend is AMD. After lawmakers banned Huawei from using TSMC, AMD quickly gobbled up all their reserved 5nm wafers. AMD is going hard pushing newer nodes, of course larger dies like GPUs do kinda need to be on older more mature nodes. Just so they can fab such huge dies without defects and get good yields. AMD also has CPUs, which are much smaller and can handle higher defect rates. AMD is pushing 5nm CPUs in 2021, probably GPUs soon to follow. While Nvidia seems to be trying to nickle and dime Samsung getting good prices on their refreshed 10nm node.Pros I think is that Samsung has a lot of capacity, they've really fallen behind TSMC lately, and they kinda suck. But obviously Nvidia can still deliver strong performance gains and will be able to pump out a lot of GPUs with all that capacity available at Samsung. Leaving all that performance on the table also gives them a really easy next generation. All they would need to do is move the same GPU to TSMC 7nm EUV (which they really just could have fabbed on today), and they would have an almost free 2x boost in performance over Ampere.Although...maybe none of this really matters. Their data center work-horse Nvidia A100 is of course on TSMC 7nm, and that's where they make all the real money anyways. Gamers not clogging up capacity on TSMC 7nm so the people who pay the real money can get all the A100s they want is a good thing.Nvidia has also been really successful in selling dedicated AI research hardware to gamers. The AI people are very happy, because they're getting everything they want, 24GB on 3090, 40GB on A100, vastly improved tensor units, hardware sparsity optimization, TF32. They're really happy about Ampere. Gamers get sold this as DLSS, RTX voice, NVIDIA Broadcast. I don't think they really realize the tensor cores will be sitting idle over 90% of the time in games, and they're really just for training and running neural networks. DLSS is really impressive though, the way AI lets you cast fewer rays and fill in the blanks with a neural network is very clever and does vastly improve picture quality. I think Nvidia has sufficiently justified the tensor cores existence to gamers and they have accepted them.It really helps Nvidia streamline their product lineup, I mean, the 3090 has36 TFLOPs FP32 (normal graphics)69 TFLOPs RT (Ray tracing)285 TFLOPS (AI acceleration)For comparison, Google's latest Cloud TPU v3, purely for AI acceleration has 90 TFLOPS per chip. Tesla's "Full Self-Driving" AI Chip has 74 TOPS (37 TFLOPS). Nvidia has really succeed in selling AI accelerators with gaming support to both data centers and gamers. It's good business and more focused development teams, good synergy.You're so performance limit by heat anyways, I think tensor cores takes up maybe 10% of the GPU, you can only create so much heat in a tiny area, throw in some tensor cores to space things out and it doesn't really matter for gaming performance. It could even improve gaming performance because it makes the chip easier to cool, just makes the whole thing a bit bigger really.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 00:06:08'] I hold a lot of NVDA, it is my best performing stockI‚Äôm not sure what to expect from gaming revenues. While I‚Äôm personally excited and will be upgrading my pc at the earliest chance, I am not sure how their gaming revenues will be impacted.If I put my investor cap on, NVDA should know that their new graphics card would be released in September which means next quarters results includes the sales of that card and future quarters.They guided to 4.4bn revenue which would account for ampere release which is up from 3.86 this qtr. however I expected more from NVDA with a new graphics card and data center growth expectations. Still I think nvda is great even at this priceIf they can eventually rake in 20bn annually, they‚Äôre not far off, at 65% margin and 4.5-5bn opex then they can achieve 8bn ebit not too far into the futurethat‚Äôs 43 times pre tax earnings and I think their growth runway is long so that figure should come down over the yearsI would say even 50x-60x forward earnings is fine due to how expensive other companies are.I‚Äôm more optimistic on their growth than fang stocks and ma/v.Yet ma is trading at almost 50 times and visa almost 40 times. Msft, aapl, fb and goog are approaching 40xNvda deserves the 100x
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 21:19:19'] I was thinking about this just today. I've been doing my DD on NVDA, and I haven't really come across a reason not to buy them. Usually there's two sides to every stock. People seem to like the CEO, they're dominating the GPU consumer space, and they have a bright future with AI and DLSS.Are there any legit reasons NVDA is a bad buy? In August alone they gained 100+ points.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 23:04:28'] Anecdotal evidence, but I feel this will be the case for many (millions?):I've been running a 1080Ti for the last few years, with no complaints. It runs basically all the multiplayer games I play at 1080p / 144 FPS. For this reason, the RTX 2080 launch was easy to skip. I had no need, and damn, was it expensive.Enter 3080 (and, particularly, 3070). "Only" $600 for a lightyear of an upgrade? With Cyberpunk on the horizon, I was finally itching for an upgrade anyway. This is an *easy* buy for me.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 23:29:48'] In my PF I have 25% Nvidia and 25% AMD. Both have potential to co exist and make profits even though they overlap in the GPU department. Nvidia is a big player in AI and data, their products are top tier and this is a massively expanding industry. AMD is coming up to releasing new CPU and GPU products and console releases, they will only increase their market share against Intel. Add to this the low power chips for laptops which are much cheaper and efficient than current Intel offerings, they may be posed to increase market share in this area, one that Intel usually dominates.

It's going for 500-ish and its performance is on par with the previous-generation 2000 dollar graphic card.You have mixed info here which gives you false conclusions. The 500 dollar card is the gtx 3070 which is better in RTX technology, rather than overall performance. True benchmarks are yet to come. And the "2000 dollar" part I just don't understand, because their equivalent 20xx series which will probably be close in performance is the 2080 card, which is around 700-1000 dollar range.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 12:27:58'] I see a lot of Nvidia fans on this thread but is anybody concerned about a 355B market cap with only 12B of revenue (in 2019)?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 00:09:15'] as a Nvidia share holder and someone who has only been buying Nvidia for the past decade and a halfThe RTX 3000 series look like an absolute home run. The hype and all the upgrading/new customers will propel this thing to reach ATH'sI bought like 20 shares a couple weeks ago at $505, and i honestly wish that i had dumped all my airline, gas and couple of restaurant stocks to buy 10 more shares of this stuff.I probably will do that when the market opens in about 6 hours.  I'll place a limit buy order at $540 and try to get 15 more shares at that price.  Will just settle at the $550 to $560 range if no more dips.It's a risky investment in a Roth, but in the long long run, it should be punching way above its weight.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 23:49:29'] From a PC gamer nerd, the 30 series looks fantastic value for the consumer. 20 series was a joke, price and performance wise. Big Navi is a threat ofc, as an AMD shareholder. Mostly I'm interested to know what the margins are on the 30 series. Rumor is that nvidia are consolidating price in anticipation of a stellar big navi release. Tbh I don't think AMD can put up the same value that this lineup can but we can wait and see. AMD and NVDA are both strong buys atm.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 00:30:53'] What was so special about today‚Äôs release? There was no surprise element except the pricing (bad for share holders). NVIDIA has priced GPUs much competitively than before probably they have insider info RDNA2. Console/2080Ti level perf should have been the baseline for next gen GPUs and Ampere did deliver on that. However, Ampere did not improve perf/w versus Turing (except in cherry picked RT+ DLSS benchmarks). 3070 ~ 2080Ti both have similar TDP. Similarly 3080 performance is 30%+ over 2080Ti but also consumes > 40% more power. In short, it reminds me of Fermi big, hot and power hog GPU. What am I missing?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 22:53:23'] Nvidia will continue and so will Amd
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 00:20:58'] One thing to note is that these new GPUS are already stronger than consoles, so Nvidia is going to convince some consumers to stay on pc.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 01:04:17'] Cheaper cards doesn't mean more profits. Really depends on how much they earn per card. But yeah they'll probably sell a shit ton.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 03:00:17'] IMHO, as long as you keep your SL in the right place, there is nothing wrong adding to your position.Everyone here will agree that is overpriced, but that is not a reason to not squeeze a bit more of profit.I bought while at consolidation for 489$, now I‚Äôm just slowly raising de SL until de bull trend ends. (I expect on election dates)
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 03:18:41'] Yea
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 03:56:52'] Nvidia will probably skyrocket once cards hit the stores. The 3070 and 3080 look crazy good. But on the other side, it is just too expensive now.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 06:04:55'] Nothing makes sense.  I don't think fundamentals like this matter, I don't think future sales matter.  We've rocketed from pre pandemic highs -- it was 294 in FEB 2020 -- today its already 550 and growing.  Get in but just understand it could drop and not reach these levels for a while.  Price no longer equals anything related to the company anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 08:18:20'] As someone who works in AI let me tell you the 30 series specifically the 3090 rtx is going to be very sought after for workstations to replace the Tesla rtx. I don‚Äôt personally own Nvidia but damn their gpus are the best on the market by far. I would not be surprised if they keep running. Furthermore, the fact they are releasing the 3090 for 1k less than the titan rtx and it has double the cud‚Äôs Cores is insane keep betting on this horse!

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 11:15:28'] I bought 30 shares of NVDA at $217 back in early 2017. Been HODL since then. I want to buy more but also looking at AAPL and AMD. I think $570+ is expensive imo
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 12:09:05'] Buy and buy more. FANGMAN to the moon. Only thing stopping these tech monopolies is a market crash. Even then, they‚Äôll rebound better than the rest.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 15:24:11'] I bought at $259 and held throughout their downfall. I‚Äôm still confident in NVDA
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 02:17:37'] I closed all my Nvidia positions yesterday.While I have zero doubt that the new card is a home run.  I do have some doubts on what it would bring to NVidia bottom line.  Gamers upgrade to newer cards at just about any price.  Setting a lower than expected price my just lower their possible profit.The fact that they said DLSS/AI gives more details than the actual original 4K frame is over hyped.  Render the new frames at lower resolution and use AI to fill in the details shouldn't make the new frame more detailed than the original 4K frame to begin with.  I think review will show artifacts with the algorithm.  Use trickeries to make up for shear power does work but rarely works on the first try. I am not even sure dumping the hot air back into the case is a great move.  Higher performance storage devices/RAM already run hot some of them already need heat sinks.  Again, let's the real reviews be the judges.If there is a decent correction,  I'll buy.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 02:24:45'] I see it as potential trouble for nvidia. Didn't seem like they improved the uarch performance outside RT much. Which would leave them behind RDNA/RDNA2 still in mm¬≤. That make the process advantage key, which amd has in TSMC 7nm.

POST_TEXT: b'Fed is speaking next week\nMany big cap tech results coming out next week\nAnd here we are at a week that ended with animal spirits rally.  \n\nOne has to wonder if this rally is a try really or a massive fake out and trapping liquidity for a lot of bulls.  \n\nLot of times the bottom feels like this.  You dont believe it and everyone thinks its gonna come back and retest.  Now way this could be the bottom.  While others are feeling the FOMO of missing the bottom.   There is always that split. \n\nBut this just feels overdone.  Big mega companies like Nvidia and TSLA have run 80% in a matter of weeks.  \n\nSo where do you stand ?  \n\nDo you think a massive drop is coming by end of March or you are in the camp that its mostly going to up or sideways for next few months and fed is going to be pausing if not cutting and lot of bad news will trickle and that would mean that the economy feels bad but the stocks market will feel good about that as all bad news will be out.   \n\nWhat are the stocks yo'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 11:53:01'] I'm in disbelief that this would be the start of a bull run, but I'm also horrible at timing the market. So like always. I have no idea.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 20:04:56'] All I know is I probably won‚Äôt make money whatever the market does
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 14:56:40'] I‚Äôll be hoarding cash by Wednesday.  That‚Äôs when J Powell speaks next, and I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôll only be a .25 hike, nor do I think it matters.  Don‚Äôt fight the Fed.  Don‚Äôt get mixed up in anything both big and new.  And then within a week, I‚Äôm likely back in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:06:14'] Not saying history predicts the future but the last time the fed raised interest rates and TSLA had a strong run it went south quick. Looking back at the 13-16 in December ‚Äò22.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 19:43:09'] It makes absolutely no sense that this would be a bull run, so it probably is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 11:31:31'] 3 options... Up, down or sidways.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:59:46'] The only thing I know is that I put around   $3k every two weeks into the market until I max out the contribution limit ($66k for this year) for my 401k/Roth accounts.  I am also holding cash in case the market turns south significantly.  With a 3.5% interest rate,   holding cash is not too bad.  I bought a ton of Amazon, AMD, DIS during the drop and together they went up around $100k worth so far.  I sold some Amazon $111 next Friday calls (8 contracts) for around 1.2k yesterday.  I also sold 5 DIS $110 next week calls (very much ATM calls) because I think I‚Äôll get some opportunities to buy back the shares bellow that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 14:35:04'] The market will do fine until consumer credit and car loan delinquencies go bad and credit deteriorates.  The tech run up now is a great way to make a quick buck but reality will set in, but timing is really questionable.  In retrospect I was too bearish because I like good values.  It is hard trading stocks when you like value but it goes up so slowly.  That said, I haven‚Äôt lost  money, just haven‚Äôt made much.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:14:05'] The FED's higher for longer narrative has failed to tighten financial conditions as we are back at the beginningof this tightening cycle at 6% inflation. They will need to do something more than sound scary now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 23:30:16'] I dont think we can expect massive rally. But if fed does +50 we can see blood. Also if you look at many indicators, we are really overvalued. Doesnt mean anything, just hints. And also, historically biggest drops comes around first fed decrease i believe ? Still long way to go, since we have  atleast two 25 ups comming.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:26:01'] I think the question to ask is‚Ä¶ What negative thing could happen that people are not already suggesting/predicting/expecting/guaranteeing will happen? I don‚Äôt know of anything of significance that falls outside of those categories, which leads me to believe the market will continue to move up for two reasons, it‚Äôs the markets natural state to move up over time, most people believe the market is going to go down because the economy has/is/will fall apart. I don‚Äôt believe this is the 1980, early 2000 or 08. I think it‚Äôs more 2014 or 2018. There are things going on but despite interest rates and a weaker economy I don‚Äôt see an alternative to equities.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 16:30:24'] We are due for a pullback but this bull market may run longer than expected since so many are predicting that we are due for that correction/pullback.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 05:06:06'] I think the market will go down, the macro is very bad. Fed still hiking into weakness. Stock market is up because of retail investors piling in because of FOMO. Bitcoin and very speculative stocks are up, it seems to be an irrational thing.Feels like September before the October lows when people were saying the bottom is in because of a technical retracement that called every bottom in the last 50 years. Just like then, I was doubting myself h but it glad I held on to my puts to ultimately profit at the October lows.Having said that, I am anxious and worried.Nobody knows anything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 11:37:36'] Next few weeks, no idea. But the tech bubble has a lot more deflation ahead. Makes little sense that so many unprofitable businesses are valued in the billions, and I expect more layoffs and bankruptcies as funding dries up. You also have large cap stocks like Tesla and Nvidia which are obvious bubbles. Not sustainable, and looks like a classic bear market rally.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:02:16'] Lots of worthless reactions about interest rates hike. Everything has been priced in so far.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 13:19:07'] Lots of times the bottom feels like this? No lots of times the bottom feels horrible, with consecutive weeks of gapping down. something like mid June, but going on for 2-3 weeks. You think the bottom is going to magically be at a technical point of 50% retracement that everyone anticipated that we'd bounce off of, right at a month where all strategists expected we'd rally off of towards the end of the year? Yes at the end September, when sp500 was around 3600, all the strategists made their sp500 year end target revision, and instead of putting something like 3600 or lower, they all put around 4000
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 16:52:44'] Fed looks at core inflation, December core CPI and PCE inflation ticked up from November. So we're heading into a FOMC meeting where the two latest reports in front of them tells them that inflation is still ticking up. Service inflation still 6% at an annualized rate. Institutions aren't buying into this rally, they're still buying into oil stocks. So I'm skeptical.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 12:51:30'] Bear run the rest of the year
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:06:09'] Fed is either going to keep on track or revise to soften rates.I don't think either is going to be bad for the market. I have been moving my 'recession' moves to tech moves the past few months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:41:32'] we either go up or down and we'll see either regret posts or I told you so posts
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 13:07:50'] Are you just ignoring the fact that Tesla, Nvidia and many other tech stocks were down 50% or more for 2022? So now you‚Äôre surprised they‚Äôre going up? You expect them to drop more? Inflation is already being curbed according to research with the higher rates, there should be minimal if any more rate hikes. I don‚Äôt think these stocks are going to drop.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 15:06:11'] I went back and looked at every attempted golden cross during correction phases and I found an interesting bit of info. In major corrections there is a fake golden cross before capitulation takes place. These major corrections need the extra optimism before throwing the knock out blow. In contrast tho for minor corrections the golden cross passes and is soon retested with a lower low before restarting the new bull trend. Opposite of the major corrections there needs to be that bear bait to help kick start the bull trend. So what does this mean for me as to what to expect in the coming days/weeks/months? In early January I went from 95% cash to about %30 cash, loading up on shares for many names. All of those names are currently big green. I‚Äôve hedged those shares with a mixture of long dated SPX/IWM spreads and some protective collars on the shares themselves. My goal here is to be positioned for long term moves but with an exit strategy that leaves me green. In sacrificing some of my gains I can ‚Äústay in the game‚Äù in case I did in fact catch the bottom of all of these names.The only name that is a big question mark for my  new positions is LCID. I bought LCID at 6.75 a share and there was some kind of meme pump Friday. Had to roll my covered calls out and my puts up but since I wanted these shares long term I‚Äôm not sure what to do here. I know how to navigate most situations now but never had this issue before. What are you supposed to do if your long term shares get meme pumped? It moved too far too fast. A happy problem to have but still a problem.

I sold my townhouse this past July at the top of the market and moved back with family to take advantage of the bear. I have around 100 in cash in case things do hemorrhage from here. Im sticking to the plan though. Ive been buying heavily through all the dips and Im finally in the green on stocks by a couple grand. I started investing just a couple years ago, went way too hard into crypto and still ass backwards there by prob 30k. I have a whole BTC, 6 ETH, and a bunch of dogshit lol. Back to stocks, I‚Äôm probably way too tech heavy and currently have recurring buys on SCHD and JEPI, $50 per trading day for each. I cant technically afford this making around 70k, but have the extra cash laying around from my townhouse sale. I have 80k sitting in Robinhood gold earning 4% which pays about $250 per month. If the rates come down or the economic landscape gets any worse I will pull it out for fear of anything shady happening with RH.

All of this debate about interest rates here is pointless. We could talk about random indicators that correlate prices, commodities, inflation cycles, lagging and leading effects blah blah - but honestly, you could be right and still be wrong about how the market reacts.From fundamentals, Tesla is overpriced. Does it matter? Did that cause the stock to not rocket up? Nope- the charts were screaming we were going to rocket but permabears keep shorting; just like it says now we are going to correct back down.  But it won‚Äôt stop permabulls from buying calls, or touting insane price targets or ATHs or how in a few years these current prices are a steal! God I wish I had their market crystal ball.

I also expect the ARM deal to fall apart (China is looking into making chips themselves and most likely won't help out Nvidia with the ARM deal).  Intel new GPU will have CUDA which has been exclusively Nvidia for years.  CUDA + QuickSync is a formidable combination for mid-price GPU.Apple has a dedicated AI circuit on its chip.

Monitor the price the rest of the week for reversal confirmation. But definitely should of atleast opened a small position at $210

But if you're like me  and it explodes upward right after dipping in, you didn't miss out. If it sinks, you can reevaluate and perhaps add more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-17 15:07:51'] It appears posters here generally didn't buy Nvidia shortly before yesterday's 4th quarter report. Unlike over in wsb is seems thousands of them bought it before the close yesterday in hopes of cashing in on a very good report. Except they got crushed.But here it seems 99% of all regular posters didn't fall for it,  so they didn't buy Nvidia yesterday. And they now can sit back a pick a low point to buy it. No worries about recouping from today's big drop. And if the 99% did buy it it was probably at such a low price several months or years ago that now they are living off the profits or at nearing retirement from the gains. It pays to be over here. Sry for the sarcastic mode, in a bad mood from buying hundreds of shares of NVDA yesterday.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-24 20:02:54'] Tried to reply to a comment that got deleted. Someone posted that their DCF valuation put fair value at under $200. This was my response.LMAO. This is completely useless without seeing your inputs in the DCF analysis. Also I feel like I see people specifically use GAAP EPS instead of Non-GAAP EPS just to make a company look more expensive. If anyone is curious you can look at a companies investor relations page and read their earnings release to see reconciliation between GAAP and NON-GAAP and decide for yourself how you want to value the company.&#x200B;Non-GAAP PE of \~56.8, FWD PE of \~48.3. This forward estimate (from yahoo finance) does not include revisions since their latest earnings release. Forward looking estimates will almost certainly be revised upwards and the stock will get cheaper on a forward basis. Not too expensive IMO for a company that just grew topline 60% YOY and bottomline 100% YOY.&#x200B;Here is what Argus Research says in their latest report for NVDA dated November 2020:"On our more forward-looking DFCF valuation, NVDA is valued in the $900s, above current prices and in a sharply rising trend. Our blended valuation is in the mid-$800s and also in a sharply rising trend.  NVidia operates powerful and profitable franchises. We believe that most technology investors should own NVDA in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven applications acceleration. We are reiterating our BUY rating to a 12-month target price of $600."

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 12:50:57'] Nice writeup, not too long and a good categorization of pros and cons.I have written about NVDA a few times before, I am long since 2019 with a cost basis of $139.50. For a long time, NVDA was about 5% of my portfolio (I prefer to hold about 20 high conviction, long-term companies in my portfolio at any given time) but recently, NVDA as a position has now fallen to more like 2-3% of my portfolio. I would therefore also like to add more (at least double my position), but I am apprehensive about the valuation (the obvious time to add would have been in March 2020, duh...).Anyway, I do believe that Nvidia can eventually easily get to $100B+ in annual revenues. I work in a "niche" field that's not quite cloud, HPC or gaming but has similar technology requirements and I foresee a version of the future where the ARM-based Nvidia DPUs dominate the generic backend compute that is still dominated by x86 today (Intel and AMD). This is also the reason why I am not nearly as bullish on AMD as I am on Nvidia. Also as a side note, we use Mellanox NICs and they are a great company/team and a technology leader in what they do (I prefer their NICs over e.g. Solarflare).To summarize, I am starting to think that I might have been wrong about the valuation with Nvidia and indeed missed some good buying opportunities during the last 6-8 months when it was available for below $500 (even after the post March 2020 recovery). Just to explain myself better, I do consider myself a value investor and typically the earnings multiple is one of the first things I look at. A lot (but not all) of my other 5% holdings are more classic "value".And just to clarify something, the thing is, from a purely quantitative POV,  40x forward earnings is not insanity... at 20% annual earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples up to 40 (or even 50) can be acceptable (see "Security Analysis" by Graham et al). It's all about what the risk is with respect to the company being able to maintain its current earnings growth trajectory.The $300B EV might be another thing that understandably turns people off, but obviously at some point Nvidia can start accelerating stock buybacks.FWIW, I am not adding yet at these levels, but I am seriously thinking about it.P.S. One thing about Nvidia is that it's not a SW company so it doesn't have SW company margins or ROC/ROA. However, part of its moat is the barrier of entry and uniqueness in the competitive space. Like you said, a risk is that the IaaS companies / cloud providers will use their profits to design and build their own chips (in that scenario, ARM is still a major winner though).

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 14:01:24'] I like NVDA and I'd like to add more before the price goes up. I own more Softbank than NVDA and honestly I thought NVDA got a really good deal on ARM, felt like it's worth more than what they agreed to. There's one element to the deal that's sort of gotten swept under the rug which is that there's a semi-autonomous Chinese sales office, which had full access to the intellectual property, that went rogue last year.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 16:23:42'] Great analysis. Definitely agree its hinging on the ARM deal. Its already priced in that they will dominate long-term, especially off of data centers. But if ARM goes through, it should hopefully surge to new highs right away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 16:41:55'] I really like the company and am excited for the ARM acquisition if approved, but I have a gut feeling that the valuation is out of whack. If ARM goes through I can see it holding is current price, but if not I think we will see a loss if buying at the current price. I of course could be very wrong, but it seems like buying now is buying at the top.That being said, anything in semiconductors is a good long term. I just bought 4 MU today since they recently announced a restructuring of R&D strategy

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 22:06:44'] I worked in the pet industry for almost a decade and it's always been a battle. Petco vs PetSmart. One will ultimately lose and I think it'll be Petco. I prefer Petco but they rely too heavily on in-store. The one major exclusive they have is orijen. But guess what? Mars acquired them and there's no way they bought them to keep in pet speciality. PetSmart owns chewy. The smartest thing they did because they don't really care for pets imo.What's the opportunity or outcome worth getting into this? It's also a SPAC and look how those have done the last year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 03:22:33'] "Anyone out there want to chime in on this?"I think there is a bit of a move to buying pet food at grocery stores and places like Target/WMT as part of an increasing move towards "one stop" convenience and I think that's had an impact across a lot of specialty retail. That's not saying that people aren't going to go to pet stores, but I do think that buying elsewhere has had an impact.Similar to WBA/CVS, Petco trying to adapt to changes by moving towards services - "Petco: We are ‚Äòbecoming a services business,‚Äô CEO says"  https://finance.yahoo.com/video/petco-becoming-services-business-ceo-150603247.html. WBA has been a "can't win" for years now. Peaked in 2015, too many stores, is down 62% since. Covid wasn't the beneficiary people thought it would be and the stock keeps heading lower. I haven't liked the business for years but at around book value with a good newer CEO, one feels like it's a little overhated. WBA isn't going to the moon (or probably anything remotely close) any time soon and neither is WOOF, but trading at around book (WOOF is at about book value) feels a little overhated for something that is not an exciting business at all but probably isn't going away any time soon. I don't own either.

POST_TEXT: b"Seems to me like tech has most potential for growth: AI, robotics, nanotech, biotech, etc, will surely influence society by A LOT. Based on the NASDAQ growth (or similar metrics) in the last 15 years this only confirms my hypothesis. It doesn't prove anything, but I don't see why that huge growth would halt. Are there any counterarguments for not investing into tech?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 15:55:16'] Sometimes, when something is popular, everyone tries to get into it. With so many competitors, they must drop prices to remain competitive, and the end result is minimal profit despite being a "hot" industry.Peter Lynch said "If I could avoid a single stock, it would be the hottest stock in the hottest industry, the one that gets the most favorable publicity, the one that every investor hears about in the car pool or on the commuter train‚Äîand succumbing to the social pressure, often buys."
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 18:42:10'] Not just tech but big tech. They are the ones with the money to ride out any storm and acquire competitors for pennies when they flail. Potential recession on the horizon and longer credit crunch will result in big tech only getting bigger during tough times.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 16:05:42'] I'll give a counterpoint or two.Many of the large tech companies have been operating monopolies over the last decade to 15 years. They took advantage of the fact that legislators were slow to adjust to new markets. There has begun to be some pushback in the last year or so, with the European Competition Commission taking cases against Amazon, Google, Meta, etc. It is unlikely that they will have the same free ride as this golden age again.I can also see adverse mental health effects developing en masse in the future from addiction to social media. Will these companies be held accountable for these? I appreciate the irony that I'm making this point on a social media website.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 21:42:41'] Layoffs means a company has grown to its potential. So they trim to cut spending.  While growing, they don't care about spending, they need to reach their potential at all cost and as soon as they can to beat competition.  If there is a new break through in tech, I will expect to see mass tech hiring again.  So basically layoffs is bad news.  Quite honestly,  I am not impressed with what they got.  Our transportation tech had not advanced as much.  Our battery tech is stuck on lithium for so long.  We're still so reliant on crude oil.  We still don't have substitute for plastic.  Chatgpt is not all that great. It can't even remember my name and my favorite color and hobbies. I have to remind it every day. Sometimes it forgets in 10 min. All it is good for is for students to do homework. Write essays and math problems.  Good for college computer science students for coding.  It basically exposes the flaw of our education system. School has been too focused on testing and memorization.  Homework is useless with chatgpt. Chatgpt is great for people who genuinely want to learn, at the same time it helps people who don't want to learn to not learn. The only impressive tech we got are screens. We got high resolution monitors, we got vr, we got projectors. Screen tech is very advanced and impressive. That's because that is where the money is at. I think tech companies growth slow down because we reached the peak of screen tech. Or near that peak. I don't think we got any ai that is near passing the Turing test yet. Tech layoffs is not a good sign in them continuing with ai development.  Definitely a lot more room for growth, but they will probably wait till after the recession to resume that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 00:38:26'] Thank you for the write up!So if the deal gets through all shares will be automatically sold to msft?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 14:03:45'] Thanks for the info - I remember your last post and the stock has gone up nicely since then.  You also mention "MSFT has never failed an acquisition in its entire history"  I have not been able to find any information on this.  Where can it be verified?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 10:07:37'] I think the deal is going to go through, but I also think that if it doesn't the immediate impact is going to be much greater than the impact after some time (let's say 3-6 months). The reason for this is that for anyone who bought ATVI after the merger announcement, as well as people who have held throughout, the investment thesis boils down to the probability that it will go through (so, let's say a 24% gain discounted for risk). If the risk that this gain doesn't occur becomes 100 % there is going to be an overreaction, because few if any investors are in it now for any other reason than the merger.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 07:10:37'] I would buy some ATVI if I didn't think it was such a dogshit company
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 15:39:36'] There was a chance this would have gone the other way. This is the classic ‚Äúsee I was right all along!‚Äù when the probability distribution of outcomes was far from certain.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 16:14:45'] Small AI companies are literally the inverse of what you want. Did you know openai started in 2015 and literally had a billion dollars to work with? Here‚Äôs the thing about AI, it isn‚Äôt cheap and it isn‚Äôt fast, a problem that is almost the worst case scenario for a small starting company. I‚Äôll say it before and I‚Äôll say it again to the people asking these questions as someone that studies comp sci, you don‚Äôt want to invest in AI. AI probably isn‚Äôt what you think it is, it definitely isn‚Äôt what most people think it is, is it an algorithm? Is it a transformer? Is it any NLP model? What‚Äôs important here is that none of this matters, what you want is a small computer technology company that has a good idea with a marketable product. Not just one doing AI because I can make an ‚ÄúAI‚Äù bot that tells me how frequently I shit per day. An example of this is something like Computational Fluid Dynamics, instead of looking for AI, trying looking for companies using AI to solve real problems
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 14:24:26'] I think it is not about having the best AI, it is about having a good understanding of future potential and application for AI.Further worth to consider is, that some sectors will benefit from AI and others will get disrupted.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 15:03:36'] Yup, any potential AI companies will be bought up by the giants (amazon, microsoft, google) etc. These giant companies have absolute monopolies in their fields and cannot be challenged without significant capital.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 17:44:32'] This is a bit like asking for "electrification" investments in the 20's, or "mobile" companies in the early 2000's.  It's a really broad topic, and really there isn't such thing as an "AI" company. It will become a ubiquitous part of everything we do, and disrupt entire sectors in different ways.You should be asking yourself how the world is going to fundamentally change in the coming decades, and position your investments accordingly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 03:36:28'] AI is a tool. Actually it's an entire plethora of tools. Just that company X has AI and large company Y has AI means nothing. "That's like saying company X makes cars and large company Y makes cars so company X cannot be worth investing in."AI in and of itself has no value. You have to look at what those companies are doing *with* their particular implementation of AI and judge whether that has an addressable market.

Their growth recently is crazy from the AI hype, and Im up way over 20% on them, so instead of gamble missing out on more upside by taking gains now, wouldnt it make sense to just set a trailing stop if like 10-12% and let it play out?\n\nI mean sure, I stand to lose 10-12% of my gains if they tank from here, but I could lose more if I sold now and they keep going up. Or am I thinking about this all wrong?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 10:49:34'] In what way do you think setting a stop is benefitting you here? The simple answer to why most people don't have stops set on all their stocks is setting a stop doesn't increase your expected return.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 13:26:11'] It seems funny how you get replies that ignore the word ‚Äútrailing.‚Äù To me a trailing stop in the situation you describe seems to make perfect sense.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:30:58'] Stop losses are pointless. The goal is to buy low and sell high. A stop loss does the opposite. If it is a good company and you believe it will go higher, you should hold it when it drops. If it is a bad company, you should not hold it at all.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 07:29:54'] Trailing stop loss is a perfect strategy in this situation, particularly if you've already racked decent gains beyond the 10-12% set. Stock goes up, you stay in the game. Goes down, you punch out. In your Roth IRA there's also no tax implications. I'm long NVDA as well. My feeling is the upside is just begining. But I understand sleeping better having the trailing stop loss in place.

Nvidia is up 19%, but this is month on month. Zoom out and you'll see it's still lost half its value year on year.People make the same mistake with "cooling" inflation.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 07:22:01'] If you have it before the split, your shares will be split. It's as simple as that. After the split, the price of a share will be much lower.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 07:22:25'] It‚Äôs not 3 additional shares. The stock prices splits as well so it‚Äôs the same amount of money you have invested. Divide the share price by the split and that is the new trading price. It‚Äôs not free money or free shares
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 07:55:54'] Wait till after splits to buy imo, prices tend to drop after splits
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 10:03:10'] If you buy the shares ATM price up until close of market on the day prior to the split, your shares will split like the rest.  1 share at 4x becomes 4 shares at 1x.  The June 21st date and wording is confusing, but the date of split is the important one. Otherwise you would have people losing value after the split, as you cannot have two market prices for one stock.Imagine this, I short 1 share of the stock on 7/18 and get $4X for it, and then replace that 1 shorted share T-2 on the 20th for $1X.  Doesn't work like that.Options, shorts, everything goes X times during the split.  One option contract at $X strike becomes 4 contracts at $X/4 strike.Please correct me if I am wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 13:02:00'] If someone holding that 1 share sells it after june 21st, its just going to transfer to the other buyer when the split comes
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 20:51:35'] Ok, so there‚Äôs some good answers here and some really bad answers here.  Here‚Äôs what happens with a stock split: any shares are split 4 new shares per each share.  The 6/21 date doesn‚Äôt really matter to you unless you‚Äôre a broker.  You can ignore that.  So what does this mean for you?  If you bought Nvidia tomorrow at open, you would still get the split of 4 shares for each share you held.  Doesn‚Äôt matter the date you bought, the record date is for the brokers.  I bought Tesla and Apple after the record dates, they still split.  This will too.  Otherwise it would be a mess to have some shares worth more than others, or it‚Äôd be really bad for investor relations for any shares bought for a month to just go down 75% in value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 07:22:29'] https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stocksplit.aspThe short answer is it doesn‚Äôt matter. You‚Äôre going to end up with the same value in your position no matter when you buy. Assuming you‚Äôre not buying specific amounts of shares
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 07:25:49'] The only thing you‚Äôd ‚Äúgain‚Äù from buying NVIDIA before June 21st  is the 3 additional shares! Your shares will split if you buy them before, and you‚Äôll have cheaper share prices if you buy after.  But it looks like they are compensating current customers with 3 shares per 1 share held.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 10:59:32'] In my opinion, you'd be buying NVDA at the very top right now, after it's had a really big run-up in a short period of time. I think it's almost always a bad idea to buy at the peak of a stock craze (and in this case, people are going crazy over NVDA) since the price usually goes starts going down at that point. If you're interested in buying NVDA, I'd wait a few days or weeks after the stock split next month.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 23:24:37'] Just buy as much NVDA as you possibly can.\*Not financial advice\*\*\*Just kidding, get rich\*\*
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 08:58:55'] What, you don't instantly make 300%?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-23 18:03:07'] True. You must have held the stick on June 21. Any purchase after is not eligible for the split. I held both Apple and Telsa before split. You just get more stock. The price is also split. So no gain.

POST: ['2021-05-25 15:08:29'] POST TITLE: b'Thinking about Nvidia'
POST_TEXT: b'Wondering if I should buy some shares of Nvidia. I have a large amount of cash sitting on the side just waiting for the right stock. There seems to be a lot of positive reasons to buy this stock and its a 22-2 bullish amongst analyst. I missed the boat on Apple and Tesla which both did a stock split and the stock continued to grow for a couple of months after the split. What are your thoughts?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 16:15:15'] NVIDIA long term is a strong play. You have earnings, stock split and ARM acquisition as three question marks with the ARM acquisition being the biggest in my opinion. If the ARM acquisition falls through it will cause a correction, whereas if it goes through I could see the stock pushing $800.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 15:44:41'] For me, NVDA has two, big short-term events that will affect the stock price, its earnings report tomorrow (will probably make it go up or down a few percentage points) and also their stock split next month in June (will also probably cause a big change in price, although not sure which direction). Also worth considering, fears about inflation have previously driven down NVDA's price the past few months and might continue to cause volatility in the near-term future. In a vacuum, though, I think NVDA should be a good stock to own longer-term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 15:53:14'] The split is nice and Nvidia is doing well, but my eyes are still on the ARM merger. If that gets the nod from regulators, Nvidia is golden. If it does not, growth becomes harder for Nvidia. The reason is that ARM as an architecture stands to expand into the desktop segment. Apple is transitioning, and Windows has the software support but is lacking the hardware. The merger would give Nvidia control over the architecture and companies like Apple and Qualcomm would have to pay royalties to Nvidia who could at the same time churn out their own ARM chips.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 15:26:26'] After the 4-1 stock split it will make it look cheaper and more appealing to people. I‚Äôm in Nvidia for longgg

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 16:13:11'] It's gone up 3x this year. Not exactly a screaming deal. The company hasn't fundamentally changed that much from a few years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 21:17:34'] Buy AMD instead, they just announced a share buyback and have strong forward guidance. Stock near support
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-26 06:36:04'] I'll be the bear here. I have puts on NVDA. They trade at a P/E of 90 and typically have a fair value estimate around $400 ($100 post-split). The split news has ran up the price in the last week with no fundamental change to the stock. There are a huge number of people who are buying it for the short term because they think everyone else will be buying it because it's cheap, all trying to sell after the split actually happens. Back to the point of fundamentals, their profit was lower in 2019 and 2020 than in 2018 - this could be fine if they were reinvesting it all, but they aren't. In 2020 their revenue was only about 25% more than in 2018 but their stock price is more than double. They're a great company, but they are too expensive right now. I would buy them if their P/E dropped under 50.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 16:02:29'] Why not go AMD! Same sector, same competitive edge, more affordable price. I believe they are going to go up up up just like Nvidia did
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-26 06:36:31'] It's a great company, and a safe investment, but doesn't change the fact that it's overbought. If you're trying to maximize your gains, I would look elsewhere.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 12:48:46'] It's important to note that investing in individual stocks carries inherent risks and may not be suitable for all investors. It's always a good idea to diversify your investment portfolio and to consult with a financial advisor or professional before making any investment decisions.  That being said, there are several companies that are actively involved in the development and application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Some examples of companies in the AI space include:  Alphabet (Google)  Amazon  Apple  Facebook  Microsoft  NVIDIA  IBM  These companies are involved in a wide range of AI-related projects, from developing advanced software and hardware for machine learning, to creating AI-powered products and services for consumers and businesses.  It's also worth considering investing in companies that are using AI to drive innovation and efficiency in their respective industries. For example, healthcare companies using AI for drug discovery and personalized medicine, or manufacturing companies using AI to optimize their production processes.  Again, it's important to do your own research and carefully consider the risks and potential rewards of any investment before making a decision.

Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out.

Let me know what you think.\n\n20% S&P index fund,\nXLK - 5%,\nXLI - 5%,\nXLP - 20.25%,\nXLU - 10%,\nXLB - 2.5%,\nXLV - 18%,\nXLC - 5%,\nXLE - 5.5%,\n5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM.\n\nEssentially were leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.\n\nRemaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.\n\nEdit: Just so we are all clear, the bottom 23.75% is for us to DCA into A'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 21:21:46'] so really you are increasing exposure to big tech.  that doesn‚Äôt sound like de-risking but rather adding risk. if you reduce financials, consumer discretionary and real estate you are naturally increasing everything else.  and by buying MSFT GOOGL AAPL AMZN etc you are doubling your exposure to that sector.if you want to reduce risk you should be owning less of these companies and diversifying more.

Most of the time, the winner of the last decade are not the winners of the next one, and by removing sectors you are taking away diversification and thus risk. For example Financials do better than during high interest rates as they can offer better spreads to their customer (the difference between the fed interest rate and what they offer the customers). In contrast technology does worse, as their ability to generate loses declines. In high interest rate environments, the hurdle rate for investment increases -  so people are less likely to own companies that start to make money in 10 years. Real Estate protects against inflation better than tech for examples.By reducing sector exposure and buying single companies that are in a single correlated sector, you increase your risk.If you want to decrease your risk, you would add emerging markets or other developed markets (Europe, Australia, Japan etc) to your portfolio. You can also add bonds for example.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 03:57:21'] I agree with others. If you really want to de-risk in the short term, you could shift into short term bond etfs. The short term (<1yr) treasury etf pays out interest around 4.4% with little interest rate risk. Ticker SHV.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 03:22:46'] If you‚Äôre going to go heavy on consumer staples and utilities, best to hold off or ease into positions for the time being. Not saying the idea isn‚Äôt good (or bad), just nows not the best time to be overweight on these sectors.Institutional money has the same idea over the past couple of months. They have inflated the valuations the components of XLP, XLV, and XLU to the point where they are no longer ‚Äúvalue‚Äù plays. These companies now have P/E ratios in the 20s even though they have single digit return on capital. These companies have low growth potential and low margins so overpaying for them makes little sense.If you expect a market downturn, it would be reasonable to assume capitulation in these overbought sectors. Thats when I would step in. We‚Äôre already starting to see weakness in XLV and XLP.

There's no timing involved. If you leave the crock pot on an extra day, no big deal. Your stew is still good. Leave a cake in the oven 5 minutes more than the prescribed bake time, you've got a burnt cake.

Leaving money in cash for a prolonged period of time while you wait for something you like - when stocks are already down 15-30% depending on sector - is not a good idea. Seperately, if you had the ability to market time and pick winners and losers - you would have sold ans re-allocated a year ago. Therefore you likely don‚Äôt have the ability and are just reacting based on fear and emotion.

Reddit has already decided and are convinced that NVDA and AMD are the better ones based on stock performance regardless of financials and valuation. Until Intel starts moving you are not changing that. Stop posting these INTC bull articles and talking trash on NVDA and AMD, its not convincing anybody and its a little annoying because it just makes you look like a shill. Just chill keep buying and stop trying to convince Reddit. These ‚Äúnews leaks‚Äù on future products and trash talking on NVDA and AMD everyday is just flat out annoying at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 18:27:11'] NVIDIA price so far has been boosted by the crypto trend and by the AI/data analytic trend. It is very expensive imo.Intel has been plagued by years  of under investment, loss of the technological hedge and of key clients like apple.I doubt a successful GPU will completely equalize the situation, nor really  make the two companies a 1:1 competitor.  That said, I consider for sure  Nvidia closer to the top than Intel, which with some good years of investments could still turn the situation around and make a come back technologically, especially now that chips are considered strategy by policymakers around the world .

POST_TEXT: b" \n\nHi all\n\nI'm not here to shit on anything. But I use to trade options on MPW. There were a few things that were yellow flags for me. Yellow flags meaning they might be issues or could indicate issues but alone are not enough to disqualify MPW for me.\n\n1. High premium usually indicates high risk. REITS that I have looked at usually have option premium more like a value stock. But MPW has premium rivaling Tesla and Nvidia.\n2. High dividends are concerns for several reasons. The biggest concern is fundamentals of the company. Another is a possible dividend cut.\n3. MPW recently wrote down a pretty substantial amount of money from one of their tenants going into bankruptcy. This was given in their last earnings report/call. This would explain the drop in share price in the last couple weeks.\n\nThen I came across some things online. The info to me turns those yellow flags into big red flags.

I feel like the phrase "It\'s priced in" is and should be incredibly accurate. So I\'m thinking after the stock splits, there may be a small bump, but I then fear a free for all with so many people selling the stock post split.\n\nObviously this is a good long term stock but, like everything else, it is currently overvalued.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how the stock will act after the split.\n\n(PS, have 6 whole shares of it myself)'
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 20:53:56'] I‚Äôd bet no significant change.  The shares are worth the same, your position will be same total dollar investment.  It will maybe entice more investors to buy nvda because the price is lower, even though it is worth the same.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 21:14:12'] Stock splits don't create/destroy any value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 21:09:26'] I think the biggest splits in the news lately had been Apple & Tesla, and they've both kept going up in price just like everything else.  I can't figure out the market.  I've only been about 30 percent in the last year.  I've missed out on some serious gains.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 21:15:37'] Stock split means basically nothing. The value of the shares are exactly the same. It's such minor news it's not even worth mentioning.If you believe in NVDA and think they are reasonably priced, there's no reason to sell. Especially because of a stock split. I'm up about +350% on NVDA because I just don't pay attention to the minor news. It doesn't matter when you're a company like NVDA with their market position.Remember too. If you've held less than a year, you're paying short term capital gains. After taxes, the value you hold in NVDA is not directly transferable to your net worth if you sell. For this reason, you should really be hesitant to sell great companies, even if their evaluation seems a little rich. If you plan to hold companies 10+ years (which I recommend that you do), the company will be overvalued for months, even years, but if the underlying asset is still solid, theres no reason to sell. Imagine if you bought aapl in 2005 and sold everytime you thought it was a little pricy or they had a stock split. Pain attention to the company, the market is secondary
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 21:01:41'] I‚Äôve got 281 shares and even more in my 401k as my largest holding. I got in fairly late too, I think this stock continues to move higher and the future looks good
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-13 21:39:15'] Just my opinion, but I think that its possible that there may be a sell off before the split. If everyone is thinking there will be a bump due to new investors with the lower price, then I'm sure hedge funds and large holders have already thought of that as well. Anticipation of a surge in value is exactly a perfect opportunity for someone to dump the stock at an all time high with plenty of buyers. I'm sure that in the future, the price may make perfect sense as the company is breaking new ground and profitable. But right now in relation to its price.... VERY speculative. Pricing in many years of growth.Not saying it will happen, but there is just so much optimism about the split, that I bet a downturn is not even in the realm of possibility for some.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-14 07:44:36'] Some recent splits of well known stocks have been a buy the rumor sell the news event (sells off near/after the split).
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-14 08:15:02'] A stock split is good for small investors as it allows them to buy shares in a company at a lower cost. Not sure what makes you think that the stock will fall post the split
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-14 07:35:06'] I believe it will run after the split, at least initially. Many investors think in terms of 100 for their positions or options so the split will open the door to some that wouldn't normally invest. I understand the conservative and bear arguments against a split rally, but hype alone should drive it up for a few days
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-14 12:54:24'] If you 100% believe it will have a small bump followed by a sell-off, then you should sell....and buy it back at the lower price. This insures you collect the moderate profits you currently have.If you are unsure, then sell some (maybe half of your stake). This way if it goes down, then you can buy more and get a better DCA. If it goes up, then you made some profits on what you sold and you still have some to ride the upswing.If you believe this is a good long term stock, then sell nothing. Hold on to your shares. If it dips due to a sell-off, then add more to your current position and wait until whatever your long term period is. If the company is good enough, then it will catch up to its "overhauled" value.What ever you decide, be sure to learn from your choice.My DCA for the stock is $151. I've had it for over 3 years. I consider it one of my core holdings and I plan to hold on to it for another 15 - 20 years, unless the fundamentals change.A stock split adds no value. The false psychology of equating a lower cost price with a discount is what drives the frenzy (if there is one). In simple terms....if you split/change a dollar into 4 quarters, then you still have a dollar's worth of value. There is no difference between the value of 4 quarters and the value of a dollar bill.Recall when TSLA split...the stock shot up 40+% over several months following the news and split.When AAPL split, it shot up for a couple of days and then went down. If I would have waited 7-12 days after the split, then I could have bought it at a better price. Instead, it would be several months before I saw any green.When TTD split a couple weeks ago, it slightly went up a point or two over the next 4-5 days and then shot up. I was hoping this one would have behaved like AAPL after the split. Nope. I miss out on this one.No one really knows how the stock's price will be affected by the market psychology behind a stock split. Decide on what to do based on the fundamentals of the company. If long term is your view, then the possible frenzy from a stock split will wash out in the long run...

Having said that, does anyone else think theres a lot of fear mongering here as well?\n\nEvery now and then there are comments like If you had bought QQQ in 2000 you wouldnt have recovered for 15 years. The same person in another thread comments Past return doesnt indicate the future bro. Sooo which one is it?\nCant we agree 2000 was a totally different time than 2022? It has been over 20 years since the crash but fear mongering is still there. \n\nToday, 60% of QQQ consists of companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Costco and more such. Are these companies similar to what we had in 2000? I dont think so. Also how would I l know, I was 5 at that time.\n\nWhat do you guys think?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 13:37:52'] Always that chance you buy at the peak. But, if you kept buying in after 2000 you would have come out ahead much sooner than 2015.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 17:02:29'] The top 5 stocks in 2000 were Microsoft, Cisco, Exxon Mobil, GE, and Intel.Step into a time machine and ask anyone back then what they thought of those stocks. You‚Äôd probably hear something like ‚Äúbuy and hold forever companies‚Äù, similar to what you would hear about the top companies you listed.People think of dot com and think of the profitless companies like pets.com. It briefly hit 300 million market cap at the most. The reality is that most market cap was in big companies like I mentioned above.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 13:39:27'] The ‚Äúpast return does not indicate the future bro‚Äù comment‚Äù can be said about both bulls and bears depending on situation so idk about that. I think the mentioning of ‚ÄúNasdaq didn‚Äôt recover for 15 years‚Äù is mostly a good faith effort to remind people equities don‚Äôt always go up. There are times when buying growth stocks make sense and times when it doesn‚Äôt. That doesn‚Äôt mean goog and the other stocks you named are going to 0. But if there‚Äôs better opportunity in different sectors you should at least be open to changing your investing thesis.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 14:10:27'] What's the alternative?Your retirement accounts depend on the broader stock market. Unless you're deeply invested in real estate and have that kind of capital, stocks are almost always your best option.If you bought at ATH, yeah, you're getting shafted regardless of what happens. And that's true for ANY company or in general. There's no easy way out. You can either sell for a loss or hold and let it continue growing.But this is why you just keep adding over time and stop making reactionary moves. Okay, you want to sell now and let someone take advantage of the cheaper shares because you have poor risk apetite? Go ahead. The winners of the stock market have always, traditionally, been those who held and held - not the ones who bought a few stocks at ATH, sold for a loss, and then missed out on the wave back to the top. This is for the broader market, btw. If you bought PELOTON, SNAP, ROKU at ATH, I'm sorry but you're screwed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 15:48:27'] If you were buying in the timeframe before it recovered, then you made a nice gain on those shares when it did recover.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 18:44:59'] It's not fear mongering when there are legitimate reasons to be afraid

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 20:07:48'] You should look up the Nifty Fifty large cap stocks of the 60s-70s and their crash in the late 70s‚Ä¶ basically a silly name for the FAANG of the era. Some of those companies didn‚Äôt live through stagflation, some still haven‚Äôt regained the valuation lost, and the rest did but it took a long time to recover. And these were large caps. I think the fallacy here is in thinking that 2000 was something that‚Äôs only ever happened once in recent living memory, or that it only took out small caps. Before the Nifty Fifty, you could probably point to how the 1929 crash of the Dow didn‚Äôt recover until 1954. The Dow blue chips were the original FAANG. While not the only factor valuation problems seem to be the common denominator to some extent in all these. Weirdly these events seem to be spread out every 20-25 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 16:06:21'] The problem is that people almost always assume the worst case scenarios(buying at exact peak) in such cases‚Ä¶also we experience periods like 2000-2015 every few decades where the markets essentially are flat in terms of overall return..those periods generally coincide with demographic shift and i don‚Äôt think we are there yet..we will see that period again from early 2030-mid 2040s.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 16:03:49'] The "Nasdaq didn't recover" isn't a prediction, it's a historical fact used as a warning. It's usually said when people say we'll be back in short term once this passes. We might, or we might not. The only thing we know is there is no certainty.So both statements are not incompatible. The past cannot help us predict the future with any certainty, but it can help serve as a warning to consider.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 17:46:12'] I don‚Äôt think it is fear mongering. Fear mongering are those click bait ads that say something like‚Äù this billionaire investor who called the the real estate bubble is worried about America.‚Äù I think every investor should read a little financial history and banking history with an emphasis on crashes and bubbles. I don‚Äôt think this is because one should cultivate a permanent state of dread but more to develop a certain base level of skepticism and what is possible. Personally I am tired of people repeating endlessly the ‚ÄúDCA and don‚Äôt think‚Äù mantra. I mean it‚Äôs fine and all but really there‚Äôs nothing to talk about, there is no intelligence required and it is just diligent saving and an assumption the economy skews positive over the long term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 16:44:09'] When people stop doing dumb shit?The 2000 peak led to a decade or more of dead money for those who overpaid.  It was remarkably similar to the early 70s peak where the index was propped up with coke mcdonalds Kodak etc at 40-50x earnings.  That led to a lost decade as well. . The 2021 peak was remarkably similar to both. People overpaying for the biggest companies in the world, spouting bullshit about how its different this time and its not about value or earnings it's about the future blah blah.It's comical. NOBODY on this subreddit would buy a small business from some guy telling you earnings weren't important and a shockingly high multiple that he was asking was ok because its different this time. If you're the only one buying you're very careful.  If you're one of thousands for some reason you're willing to ignore rational thought and history, and gamble.Comical.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 16:45:08'] The problem is that since the tech bubble, we've bounced from one bubble to the next without a true correction sans bailouts of the financial sector. The Great recession was mostly borne by households while the banks, investors and other financial stakeholders of the financial sector meltdown were bailed out/propped up. So we are in a new era if the plunge protection, bailouts and propping-up-stocks-first approach to managing the economy is off the table. Finally, much of the prosperity of the past 20 years is due to the gains of efficiency and synergy of globalization, which is on the chopping block due to our trade wars & sanctions. That and the "peace dividend" we've enjoyed are also things of the past.There are a lot of reasons why the past 20 years is very different than what the next 20 years can be, for investors.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 14:13:33'] Ah, let me scratch off "This time it's different" from my /r/stocks bingo card.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 19:51:52'] I would say this market is more similar to 08 than 2000, but I guess your post revolves mostly around tech and the dot com bubble. Either way, I can‚Äôt say we‚Äôre dealing with any kind of unforeseen bubble here. We‚Äôre dealing with an identifiable and measured foe, inflation. We‚Äôre not dealing with a banking issue or a mortgage crisis as a primary mover here. The feds need to control inflation so we‚Äôre not paying $15 for bacon. It‚Äôs not about the no documentation loan on the gardeners 3rd investment property at 0 down, who proclaims to be a landscape engineer making $15k/month and nobody bothers to check as long as he‚Äôs considered ‚Äúcredit worthy‚Äù. The only common denominator is what happened in 08 was totally on the feds as a consequence of unprecedented rate cuts to stimulate the economy after 9/11. The problem in 2022 was the feds keeping the rates low for such a long time and of course Covid basically put shit into hyperdrive with the printers. Ultimately, our government made a decision at some point, maybe politically influenced, that the American people should never feel the pinch of economic downturns. That we should always enjoy the spoils of our economy and help move it along as 70% is based on consumerism. I mean, if this doesn‚Äôt smell a little ponzieesh‚Ä¶idk what does.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 16:23:59'] Look at it this way. Stocks just went 12 years, 2009 to 2021 where the average annual return was 15% a year. Stocks over 50 year periods return 9 to 10% per year. So use logic: the last 12 years were not normal and therefore "return to the mean" is inevitable.Also, the fed is not a friend of stocks and is raising rates to slow things down. High interest rates become appealing for savers because "THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE" is in play. We are no longer in "THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE (TINA)" because we will soon find 5 or 6% savings yields (Think Treasury Bonds, and CD's)  at this pace of interest rate hikes.After we drop 40% to 60% during this current bear market, a new bull will be born, but it will climb back a lot more slowly as it always does. Recovery's always take 3 to 7 years, but can take a lot longer.  And the climb back will have several 5 to 10% corrections along the way.I lived through all crashes going back to 1987. If we do see SP 500 return to say 4500 to 4900, A lot of people will run for the exits again because they will be happy to just sell and break even. Some stocks will never get back to all time highs ever again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 17:07:21'] The "Nasdaq didn't recover for 15 years" comparison is one of the dumbest comparisons on this sub. The Nasdaq index had a PE ratio of 200 at the height of the dotcom bubble. There were many companies on the index with insane valuations when they didn't even have a path to eventual profit. It is not at all comparable to 2022.If you want to make a comparison, you can easily compare today to Volcker's rate hike period in 80s or stagflation in the 70s, but you will rarely hear about those because the google charts just show a straight line for those periods when you hit the max button.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 13:28:56'] Long US tech. There will be rough patches but it's the best. Just keep buying, maybe some TQQQ soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 17:42:42'] The overall market may take awhile and this why I don't have a lot of market index funds in my portfolio.If you invested in individual stocks and they are good companies you will recover long before the market does.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 15:28:06'] Its hard to compare. The internet boom/bubble was the last ‚Äúnatural‚Äù bubble. It occurred because commercialization of the internet was like electricity or the model T, a big technological deal. And, the bubble was funded with real, existing money, invested by rich people via VCs. Not by bank loans that might have been inflationary. Therefore, the boom, bust, recovery took a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù amount of time. The ‚Äò08 housing bubble was un-natural, created because lending rules were relaxed too far Gov borrowed $11T. $3T normal budget overruns. So, $7-8T of inflationary bailing out banks and others got us to 2019. Hidden by Fed subduing rates and manufacturers making packaging smaller for same prices. (Remember when ice cream went from 1/2 gallon to 3 pints?)PPP, extra unemployment and vaccine development cost about $3.5T. The extra $6.5T‚Ä¶inflationary.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 15:31:57'] Such comments don't even make sense. Recover?What did these people stop buying or something?Sure the money you had before hand took 15 years to "recover". So what? If a market is down say 30% by the time it's recovered if you DCA consistently you averaged 15% gains on the money invested since then and the rest still broke even eventually then also started making gains thereafter. Maybe these people just love to buy high sell low and will ignore the sale and wait until it's more expensive to start buying again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 19:55:17'] Going from ATH to ATH could quite easily take that amount of time. It has nothing to so with how your portfolio will recover and the wealth you can build yourself. I think people get to worked up about how long will it take to recover, it doesn't matter. You can make money up, down and sideways. The only thing that matters is being aware of direction. ATH is not an important number, it's just a number.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 23:00:11'] It was a completely different situation in 2000.   That was a micro issue.  The companies were priced wrong.  Today it is a macro issue in most cases.So it is not that Apple or Google or Microsoft are having issues but instead they are part of the world that is having issues.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 09:41:06'] The problem isn't in the stock this time, that's why it's so much worse.See, 2000 and 2022 are different. In 2000, the federal govt had the assets to step in and stop the drop. Same with 2008. Excpet 2008 was so bad that it rook all the gov'ts energy to stop ot from becoming a depression. Liquidity basically didn't exist after that. That's why we wnet from normal monetary policy to ZIRP and QE.The deflative power of 2008 was so bad those two policies didn't even cause a >2%, inflation rate for a decade. Then when it did, the feds started trying to raise rates and the executive administration at the time pressured the treasury to pivot so the market was green for the 2020 elections. After 2020 we went full on helicopter money...Long story short, there was a debt accrued for saving the economy in 2008. The govt never relieved that debt when it could have, and then accrued more debt in 2020. That debt will suck up liquidity again and cause deflation tk run rampant, and if it happens during a recession as we're entering right now, it can turn it into the very depression the govt tried to stop in 2008. Any economist will tell you deflation is far more dangerous than inflation.That's what everyone is afraid of. We have a ticking time bomb in the federal debt pile and just as it's reaching maturity we're entering a recession. This could nuke the american economy for decades. That's what's different.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 09:34:29'] I tend to agree with for the most part. Human behavior is an odd thing. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. That's what makes a market. But a lot of Bears tend to be nasty towards people who aren't bearish. I've seen personal attacks and nasty tones from Bears that would rival  r/politics.To be clear, I have zero issues with Bears or a bearish bias. There's certainly plenty to be bearish about. What I do have a problem with is the perma-bears who are seemingly rooting for others to lose their money. No matter your bias or position, be humble. There's always someone on the other side of your trade.I dunno, it seems like there's not a lot of civility in society these days. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 20:51:11'] Not sure you can talk about a recovery when we have not bottomed yet. The 15 year average forward P/E on the S&P is 15.5. The 6 great companies you refer to gave a blended P/E of 38.68. They deserve a premium but their growth rates don't justify a P/E over twice the S&P average. Until this bubble pops there is no need to talk about a recovery.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 18:49:01'] You guys are so bullish in this sub, it‚Äôs adorable. Now the posts are feel like self deception. Bank of England is shaken. Credit Suisse could easily default.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 16:03:15'] The scenario you are talking about impacted a very very small minority of investors.  Very few people bought, and only bought at the high, and then didn‚Äôt buy any more.  Most people were buying on the way up, then on the way down.  Did some ‚Äútraders‚Äù get caught?  Yup, but investors had cost averaging working to their advantage.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 18:41:05'] While I don't dare guess any timeline whatsoever (nor try to predict the inflation, the feds or governments actions, or a possible split world with a smaller western market due to russia-china+others in a partially separate economic sphere), it seems likely, almost inevitable barring great disasters or ww3, that the companies contained in QQQ and nasdaq (and similar tech companies around the world) will grow explosively due to AI and automation of the physical world.Once that ball really starts rolling, its nearly impossible to compete with or stop barring regulation or extreme taxation of automation.It's easy to think, it will take a long time. Decades, surely? But as we have seen in the past, technical revolutions can happen VERY fast and the next one due to its initially low and later non-reliance on human labor might be the fastest one yet, and if this turns out true, it's buy and hold or miss it.

This is the fourth "calamity" I've traded through and all are the same and each one is different. You have no idea how this is going to shake out. This one could take a generation to recover or we could be staring at new highs in 24 months (not likely). >Can‚Äôt we agree 2000 was a totally different time than 2022? It has been over 20 years since the crash but fear mongering is still there. Yeah it is different: no one was directly threatening global thermo-nuclear annihilation, China was shoveling endless streams of cheap shit unabated into the US, the thought of large-scale war on the European continent was an impossible nightmare, China had a laughable military, no one questioned the US dominance in nearly every aspect anywhere in the world, the Fed *lowered* interest rates in response to the collapsing markets, *deflation* was a bigger threat than *inflation*...yeah things were different, for sure.The "fear mongering" is still there because the people with the money today traded and invested through 2000, and it left an indelible impression on all of us...no one is "fear mongering", they're dropping a truth bomb.If you want to survive this, just follow price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-15 19:24:44'] It took 30 years to get back to its peak adjusting for inflation after the great depression.

Ease of noobs getting in the market, ie. Robin HoodBut those things don't change human behavior, just maybe increase the magnitude of the change rates ... sometimes making the changes faster, but something slower.Revert to the mean is a real thing

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 05:26:38'] I think what a lot of young people in the West doesn't understand the difference between nominal returns and absolute returns (adjusted for inflation).That is because this is the first time a lot of people experience high inflation.If inflation keeps staying high (no need to go even higher), most likely you will not see long before nominally Nasdaq will recover.If you are looking at inflation adjusted return ... that is another matter.From the peak of 1968, S&P took until 1992 to recover on inflation adjusted basis (it recover in 1971 nominally!!) .  And from 1929 until 1959 (1954 nominally).Inflation makes things look far better than they were, and because the last 20 years you didn't had much of it in US people are just ignoring it when making these calculations.

All were purchased on Monday. At first, Nvidia was rocketing up and had made a gain of about $50. Microsoft lagged and started dipping down. Now Nvidia is down into the red and both Microsoft options have lost about $45 each. \n\nI've been saying I want to hold the options so I could sell them just before the expirations but I'm worried that I might end up losing $200 or more. I could simply let them expire but then I get nothing out of it. Or I could sell them now and cut my loses but then I might miss a rise. I'm wondering what other people here think.

BUT‚Ä¶I play leaps and I only buy at a strike price that is AT LEAST 10% in the money.Anything this short term and THAT FAR OTM, is extremely risky.This is just what I do, and not giving you any advice what so ever‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 11:04:57'] I am not a financial advisor. Ive held MSFT stock for awhile. Expecting a 10% move in the next 2 weeks for a $2T company is a bit unreasonable. Doesn't mean it wont happen. Down $45 means their value has already halved.Anything could happen, and I suppose all of these options could print. My opinion though? Dump them and buy something else.Judging by the post, you might need to stop with options for the time being. You dont have a strategy to deal with them, but more of a hope and a prayer.A lot of ETFs have heavy positions in MSFT and NVDA. If you like the companies, find a cheaper ETF that you can afford the actual shares.Probably not the answer you want to hear, but I'd look at the loss as an educational fee and move on. No one wins every trade.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 11:13:10'] You should learn about the Greeks first before playing in options.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 11:19:01'] I'd cut my losses. It looks like you bought these pretty late into their rallies and a 10% correction would be considered healthy in both of these names. Obviously anything could happen but with time decay working against you your chances of breaking even or profiting are becoming slimmer. I'd recommend buying any of these names on a major dip and then maybe going 6 months+ out to give yourself time for the trade to develop. This is just my opinion and it's what I've been doing to make money in these names. I have a MSFT 200 jan 2022 call that's up almost 3x and an nvda call I bought on the dip after earnings that's for 2023 that's already up quite a bit

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 12:52:58'] Sorry, you expected MSFT to increase by 10% in a month? That would be a 200B increase in market cap, in a month.  The only options you should buy are ITM leaps.  They are expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for, you get a much more realistic chance at profit.  If you cannot afford that, then don't play options.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 11:46:31'] Learn the Greeks. You seem to have bought options with high vega and low delta. The probability of far otm options being itm reduces drastically once the event is over. Just take it as a learning experience and move on.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 13:43:50'] Buying calls on stocks like MSFT is bad moves.  Just buy shares.  Get off WSB and make money investing instead of gambling on OTM calls
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 12:27:08'] To be blunt - you have a very poor options strategy and you should look into understanding how the time decay aspect of it works. Learnings about the Greeks will help you immensely. These were both roll of the dice gamble types of trades and considering you're already looking to bail, it doesn't seem you have the risk appetite for that kind of move.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 15:41:26'] Playing OTM and hoping for it to be ITM is a dangerous strat. I‚Äôve lost hella money doing this. This is kind of why I prefer to buy ITM and longer dates. But every strat works until it doesn‚Äôt lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 16:48:25'] [Here is a full set of graphs with labels for different time periods, showing the performance of different US/international allocations in terms of return/standard deviation (risk)](https://imgur.com/a/tj0ygmE). Make sure to read the imgur labels for the first two as they cover different time periods.Takeaway: In some periods, either over entire decades or even 3 decades, a 100% international portfolio gave you more return, though with a lot more volatility (i.e., risk) than 100% US. In other decades, 100% US had better returns, and with less volatility than 100% international (but more than 70/30 split). But over the entire period, 100% US wins, in large part due to post-09 outerformance.But generally, if you want to overall do well across your lifetime, it seems a 20-30% allocation to international is suitable. Your goal is to get as high return for as little tradeoff in volatility (i.e., somewhere near the top left corner, unless you can get a lot farther to the top by going a little to the right). Such a split will make sure you're not at the bottom of the curve in periods like 1970-2006, but it may come at the cost of not being at the very top of the curve.Right now the risk/reward tradeoff is better outside the US based on historic PEs, and I do *not* mean just comparing PE of ex-US to US, but comparing the relative PE of ex-US/US to its historic levels. That is, the ratio (PE of ex-US)/(PE of US) over time. (Obviously the PE should be lower for Europe, but no reason to think it should be at some of the highest percentiles of cheapness in history right now). It's also important not to fall for the fallacy that the strongest economies = best stock performance. Higher GDP growth in the US does not mean it will have better stock returns, just like higher GDP growth in emerging markets doesn't translate to better returns. Though it is a good indicator. I personally take a concentrated bet by a big tilt not just to ex-US stocks, which are cheap, but small cap value ex-US stocks. This is the cheap of the cheap, the deepest value of the equity styles (large/mid/small and value/blend/growth). So I'm definitely pushing for the top/right parts of the curve since I'm accepting higher volatility.

As if the lows are going to be more certain than the peaks of inflation? Why is anyone going to step in trying to bottom-fish once prices start rolling down?  the demand for stocks depends on inflation, regular people have no interest in markets otherwise.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 08:30:17'] >U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year.There are still plenty of US households who have nothing better to do with their money than spend it on stocks. They can keep buying the dip because to them it doesn't matter whether the market goes down or starts to rally. It's opportunity cost that people are consciously making; buy more equities because there's nothing else that they need their money for.Additionally, depending on the size of your account and your account type, it may not be feasible at all to sell everything and wait for a better opportunity. Someone who has 6-8 figures in a taxable brokerage account isn't going to be able to sell everything without incurring a massive tax penalty for doing so. Many people who have these accounts simply borrow capital from their stocks and never sell; in a year like this, the best option for them would be to borrow less than they normally do or pay down some of their short cash position (High Net Worth individuals typically call this strategy buy, borrow, die, with the idea that you don't pay capital gains during your lifetime).Outside of Reddit, when I talk to people that I know (medicine, tech, finance, and construction industries primarily), wages are decent right now, bonuses are still on the table for most people (depending on how the rest of the year unfolds), and lay-offs haven't been any different than any other year (many Fortune 500 companies have annual layoffs in the fall as part of their typical business cycles). For these folks, it's business as usual. Lots of companies are still hiring strategically. On Reddit, there appears to be a different story brewing (e.g. wages are bad, layoffs are en masse, panic is setting in, etc.); this likely points to people being in different industries who are experiencing a different economy.I don't think that buying the dip will fall out of favor. I think that the people who are buying are doing so consciously.Good luck to all!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 09:01:43'] Going to keep buying personally my own opinion is we could fall more maybe down to 330-340 but i don‚Äôt think we will see the 40-50% more down people have been saying. I find it more likely we go through a period of time where the markets are relatively flat and pes that have been expanding since 2008 slowly catch back up to averages. I think dividend stocks with growth will continue to do well once the market bottoms and we go range bound for a bit. Something like a MSFT with a little dividend/ share buybacks/ decent growth I think will do decent especially if we see another 10% ish pull down. DCA into company‚Äôs that you use daily and understand and keep a minimum 25-50% in index‚Äôs and keep some cash on the sides and you will do great in the coming years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 07:56:21'] My unasked for bear thesis: not enough people are paying attention to the DXY, and it feels like by far the most important index right now. If ANY other index was surging the way we see DXY is surging, people would be tripping over themselves to be in it. I suspect that because "dollar strength", though, is such a nebulous concept for most of us nobody really cares.For you, me, and any other average investor, the 10% increase in DXY we have seen over the last 3 months doesnt really amount to much. We just dont have enough cash for it to really matter. Particularly in the face of high inflation. For these investment groups, companies, and banks with hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, though? That 10% increase in dollar strength is meaningful. It makes zero sense for them to move off of cash positions until they start seeing prolonged evidence of the dollar strength stopping its run. This last week just closed with the dollar increasing by its largest single numerical candle increase, and among its largest percentage increases, that it has seen during the bull run its been on since last summer. Its not slowing, its still maintaining. DCA is still, by far, the most effective method for us low money investors, and that's going to hold true no matter what. However, until we see the dollar strength show prolonged evidence of slowing it just makes no sense for the big money that determines the direction of the market to start pouring enough in to spark a new bull run. Just my thoughts, and what my personal investing plan right now is built around. Everyone is more than welcome to disagree, but I just decided it was a thought worth sharing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 07:34:29'] Buying the dip worked great in a high QE/low rate environment during an uptrend. people were trained that if they put $ into the market it would just go up.Now that the Fed is not pumping money into the market and NAIIM exposure is down to 26%, the 2 biggest sources of liquidity have been pulled. Until one comes back, the total market will continue to slide. Retail cannot prop it up by ourselves.It makes no sense to buy the dip for a hundred reasons right ow, but this is the biggest one.

In a bull market you can expect your dip purchases to go green relatively quickly. In a bear market you should be more concerned with DCA over a long period of time, rather than thinking you ever timed the exact bottom. expect to lose on every purchase you make in the short term, maintain cash balance to be able to slowly add to your position with the intention of pushing your average down as the market slides. Expect and embrace the pain and you‚Äôll come out ahead in the long run, that‚Äôs how I see it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 17:56:04'] The dip that keeps on dipping
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 17:57:22'] Buying the dip historically works when it's not a recession. Recessions are multiple months long and will often have more than 1 bear market rallies. A buying the dip strategy where the contribution grows as the price (and market) decreases toward a mean valuation will be a more successful variant to blindly buying the dip.  All stock strategies will have flaws as no one truly can see the future, but if the premise is simply buying something cheaper today than it was yesterday, then only time can determine the successfulness of the strategy. Since mean regression suggests a CAPE of 15 is roughly the 60 year average, that still suggests the market can drop below "fair value" due simply to the time in overpriced territory still leading to a short term unsuccessful strategy.Edit: Moreover, the mean CAPE over the past 40 years suggests a flaw in the value of 15 or the market has been inflated for nearly 40 years. This isn't to suggest shiller is wrong, but the market has a lot more participants with a lot more debt, huge passive index investing environment and more complicated financial products (think derivative, sub prime loans, shadow banking, etc) than we did 40-50 years ago. Either the CAPE would need to fall for a sustained period below 15 or a new mean should be used.

Bank of America also reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock and praised the company\'s robust financials.\n\nNvidia reported better-than-expected sales and earnings on Wednesday afternoon, and its data center unit outperformed its gaming arm for the first time. The company also guided for a strong second half of the year on gaming sales growth and continued data-center strength.\n\n"All growth roads" lead to Nvidia reaching a half-trillion-dollar valuation, the analysts said.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 18:27:46'] I wonder if nvidia will jump on arm systems. The nvidia tegra was not that popular but I think arm processsors are about to get even more popular with companies like apple going away from intel. Just an idea.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 20:27:00'] Stocks used by based on cash flow. You would think a 500 billion company would generate something like 20bil in fcf, but don't even Know how valuations work now days.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 15:22:50'] What? LolI read the OP as NVDA is worth getting on. I read your reply as though you own stock and will sell. Maybe I misunderstood?
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 15:09:47'] In my opinion NVIDIA has been running with out any competition (weak AMD - No high end GPUs for last 5 years) that may about to change in next 6 months. NVDIA can no longer demand for $1200 for Ti level card and $2500 for Titan. Before it used to be $600-700 for Ti and $1000-1200 for Titan. My 2 cents :)
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-21 11:06:25'] I got in around 380/share and keep thinking about buying more very soon.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 16:13:33'] I would go for amd since I'm very certain AMD will dominate the mid rage market very soon. But only time will tell. Just see how they took Intels market by surprise. I'm sure nvidia dominate the  high end market, and I know amd can't compete with that. But with better pricing and hopefully optimized drivers, big navi is going to take the lead.

POST_TEXT: b"So, I'm watching prices for various stocks that I'm interested in drop pretty nicely today, but my trigger finger remains immobilized. Adobe, dropping as low as $305 (new 52 week low), Microsoft dropping back into the mid 240's, AMD dropping to the mid 70's. Nvidia under $130. Seems like lots of great opportunities. Why not buy these puppies right now?\n\nI just can't. You know damn well that Jerome Powell is going to say something next Tuesday or Wednesday that's going to spook the markets again. Sure, the markets will likely overreact to the downside, and then recover a bit about a week later, but won't ADBE, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, etc, etc, all be EVEN LOWER after Jerome spooks everybody next week?\n\nWhy are people buying right now? Contrarian thinking?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 09:40:39'] TBF, the last FOMC meeting sparked about a +19% rally in the S&P 500 just because he said something like "We're at neutral."
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 12:45:02'] "You know it's going lower"No, you don't.  That's the bottom line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 09:59:23'] If they announce 0.75% it might rally. So who knows.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 11:46:04'] Usually, the day he opens his mouth, it actually goes higher. The market is forward looking, it goes down anticipating a disaster, and goes up the actual day of the disaster.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 10:14:44'] Powell could also get up there and do the exact opposite of what you expect. Or the market can say ‚Äúwe priced that in already‚Äù and skyrocket. If you knew, if any of us knew, our investment accounts would reflect that foreknowledge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 11:27:17'] Yeah when "we all know it's going lower" usually means shorts are about to get burned.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 10:02:57'] That‚Äôs the thing - I never have a clue what‚Äôs going to happen. Usually when I ‚Äúknow‚Äù something is going to happen, everyone else knows it too so the event is already baked into pricing. In my experience, that‚Äôs usually when markets show weird little pops because often everyone was more paranoid than necessary and baked bigger increases into the pricing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 10:34:00'] I just know there's been plenty of times there was a very strong sentiment by majority it'd move 1 way, then end up moving completely possible. Idea is stocks can move on magic short-term sometimes. RemindMe! 1 week
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 11:11:34'] Then put your money where your mouth and is buy puts since you obviously know which way the market is heading.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 17:54:08'] This is just a rumor, but a good friend from the FOMC Federal Bureau of Reserves told me Jerome actually is coming out next week in a tailored suit with rockets embroidered all over it.Not financial advice, just passing on my intel.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 12:36:06'] There are many reasons stocks are being bought right now outside of just "contrarian thinking" - some things you may not have considered:* Dollar cost averaging* Passive investments into 401ks and IRAs* Fund rebalancing/sector rotations* Short covering after a big dipPersonally I believe there are a lot of great tech stocks that are oversold and see these dips as a wonderful opportunity to get in on some companies which had inflated PEs last year. Don't really care about what Powell says because it's insignificant if you're DCAing over 5-10yrs
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 14:56:31'] After Jacksonhole speech, I was looking at the market. Market fell slightly, then reversed and went green for few seconds. Then we had that -2.5%ish day. I just wanted to say that nobody knows how day traders and algorithms react to his speech. Last time we fell slightly and then rally. BTW, don't buy a stock because it is down. Do an analysis and make assumptions about future growth and risk free rates. All those names can fall a lot more. And once you bought, hold unless your thesis is proven wrong. There will be a lots of ups and downs in this market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 10:05:26'] I just bought a little again today, and will continue to buy small amounts (some new some buying back in from when I pulled out halfish in April). If the market overreacts I will buy more again then.Every day we are more sure the apocalypse isn't going to happen in the market, I find that reason to slowly reenter. If something happens or appears to be on the horizon like a Tiawan issue, then I will pull out a bit again and slowly start reentering again.It's not about timing the best entry ever but instead just making calm exits when I am more uncertain about large events otherwise just constantly adding small amounts on any downturn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 10:58:54'] Why not buy on a red day? You're basically TIMING THE MARKET by saying to wait for Jerome to open his mouth. It could be a green or red day when that time comes, if green you've missed your chance to buy lower if red it's your lucky day for another nice market discount. Food for thought.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 11:45:11'] I was counting on the market mooning at the CPI report and it went straight down. Who knows man. I still think the market needs to retest those June lows before we move up again. I could see it going lower and I could see a melt up but macro environment makes that very difficult.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 09:54:10'] >  You know damn well that Jerome Powell is going to say something next Tuesday or Wednesday that's going to spook the markets again.That's the thing, I don't think anybody knows what Powell is going to do.  Predicting the future is hard, even if it's one man.  Further if everybody _knows_ this, then the results are likely already baked in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 13:28:33'] You know it is going lower? This very man you mentioned also gave me over 100% return on all my stocks not too long ago. Daddy Powell is going to save us all.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 12:44:30'] If he says he‚Äôs going to remain data driven and then issues 75 bps, it could bounce just because he said nothing new.  If it‚Äôs 100 bps then we go straight to 3600.

If prices are attractive for you then buy, if not wait. Who cares if prices keep going down you don‚Äôt think like that when you‚Äôre happy with a house/car/electronics price why would you think like that about a company?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 09:42:22'] I would disregard Adobe since they announced an Aquisition, but I agree with the sentiment. Looking at EPD after the rate hike. I think this is the last one for a few months.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 10:50:45'] Actually, I expect it to rally when he speaks. Right now there is a lot of fear and a lot of selling happening,A strong 100 bps hike would signal that we're doing something about inflation, so imo that would be good news and could spark a rally. Because it would restore confidence in the Fed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 12:49:37'] The fed really really wants that inflated s&p bubble to come down. That‚Äôs basically the runway of their soft landing. That long down stretch from Jan 2022 until it gets back to pre covid levels.And they haven‚Äôt talked much about Qt. So lotsa room to go further down.The fed in Simple terms wants average folks and assets managers to pull out money from speculative stock (and stock in general) and get more unemployment. Not an easy task.But heck what do I know. At this point it‚Äôs just a crapshoot finding that false bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 15:42:25'] The market doesn‚Äôt work on ‚Äúlogic‚Äù.  It‚Äôs illogical.  Take all the thinking, logic, analysis, data and chug it out the window.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 12:18:01'] IMO, i think the rate hikes are all priced in by now. Whats not factored in is the effect of the interest rates in the overall performance of the companies and the economy in general. I think we will rally maybe for the rest of year until December. I hate to time this but thats just my gut feeling.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 15:24:44'] Each time we raised the bps by 75, the market dropped on that day even though it was ‚Äúbaked in‚Äù. But anything could happen. Since today is another red day, it could be green when he announces 75. Who knows.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 17:14:05'] I think the move is largely priced in by now. If anything we could see upside when they inevitably announce a 0.75 rate hike purely because it‚Äôs not a 1.0 hike. Just like the market was hoping for 0.50 a few weeks ago, there are expectations for 1.0 prices in rn.Unless he says something super unexpected like‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwe fucked up the last 14 years, that is not sustainable‚Äù I dont think the announcement/speech itself causes the next leg down. That‚Äôll be later‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 10:30:46'] It must be so exhausting thinking you can time the minutiae of every FOMC meeting, every inflation announcement, to the smallest detail and still claim to have an edge over such ridiculously short time scales, probably with the intention of selling out in less than a year's time.Ever wondered what would happen if everyone worked like that? There would be no stock market, no economy, no investment, no wealth. Everyone would be a slave or a hunter gatherer.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 12:09:45'] Cause I buy companies based on the company and that companies fundamentals. What isnt part of my investment thesis in a company is what J Powell is going to do with interest rates the next day. Could the market go lower? Absolutely. Do we know for sure its going to keep going lower? No. If you look at history the best time to buy into markets is when things are red cause you will have better returns over the long term. ‚ÄúIn bear markets stocks return to their rightful owners‚Äù The people who walk away with the highest returns are the people who stay the course and continue to dca.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 17:06:28'] You have to think about these like assets not trading cards. Think about it like buying 50 lb sacks of oatmeal. Let's say you have a lot of people you have to feed. Currently those go for about 30 bucks wholesale. If you get a 20% off sale and they are $24 are you going to wait to see if they go 30% off? I'm not I'm buying some at 20% off and I'll buy more at 30% off and if it gets really crazy and we get 40 or 50% off I'll use all my remaining capital and then some. It's a lot easier if you stay connected to the fact that you're buying assets not news stories. Not headlines. Not knee-jerk reactions on the day some event happens. The one that blew up after hours today, FedEx. Trading 170s. If that thing gets in the 140s. I don't know about you guys but I'm buying. You just have to develop levels on the assets you want and why they make sense to you. If you're buying an asset for $200 and the only reason you buy it is because you think it's going to $250 you're going to have a lot of problems if it goes to 150. You're going to sell it and then you're going to wonder why you bought it in the first place. This is the cycle that blows up most novice traders. Buy stuff you actually want to own. It makes the drawdowns a lot easier. Just my opinion here but the one stock I would absolutely not touch is NVIDIA. I would be buying Intel hand over fist before I touch Nvidia. Why? Because crypto has driven Nvidia for the past 5 to 6 years. Eth going pos. We have no idea what that will do to the Dynamics of Nvidia but we do know what Nvidia looked like in 2015 and it was a hell of a lot lower than where it currently is. Will there be another alt that catches on? There could be will it drive cards like ethereum? Maybe, I absolutely would not front run that. that's just me though.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 11:40:23'] Nobody knows what will happen in the short term.   Sure it's very likely to go lower as the current price is about a 20% premium to the historical average and a 40% premium to periods of high inflation.  The local bottom however may very well form before FOMC.

Everyone who is afraid is likely to be liquidated on Tues/Wed and fresh vultures will be ready to swoop in and scope yard sale prices on good shares, which causes a rally.

They are already seeing the increases work in places like housing in certain areas. People need to be more patient and they are going to use all available tools at their disposal but not act rashly. They will operate themselves in a measured way and use many data points to make decisions not just one month's worth of data.

If they do, it could be the last of the jumbo hikes honestly. If there's any whiff of that expect a rally. Right now we're in a panic.Is it justified? Yes. We likely go lower, but the fed is aware that rate hikes hurt the economy and come on with a lag. They could make that apparent at the next meeting.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 19:47:13'] Hopefully the fed realizes now that their rate increases against inflation are useless against supply chain issues and lower income labor shortages. Demand will continue and keep pricing up because of that solely. Really the fed should shift soon and then cut rates while simultaneously dumping bags of mbs. I see no other way for them to have a chance at unloading them. If they keep playing with fire there doing ineffective rate increases and housing tilts bad then it will be a shit storm. Their timing overall has just been horrible with everything. I do think inflation is at a temporary peak but probably see another sharp rise in the next few years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-15 21:28:25'] At the June low in stock prices, the bearish sentiment was extremely dominant.  Now we are getting toward the June lows for many stocks, so I would think that bearish indicators would be back to high bear soon.  Bank of America's is pressed at zero again, similar to 2008.I would think buyers are wanting to see that indicator low, and they are getting it.  The next question is: if economic conditions get worse and worse, how much more is bearishness justified.Oil is down, but the ships off the coast are still waiting in long queues.  The Red Army is getting its ass handed to it in some areas for now, which is miraculous.  Containment of a conflict helps business find a way around the situation after a while.Usually the stock market is going down while unemployment has started rising.  We don't have any unemployment.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidia-reveals-cheaper-chip-for-desktops-new-gaming-laptops-that-could-avoid-supply-crunch-11610472725\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia said it would launch an even more inexpensive desktop graphics card, the RTX 3060  without the Ti designation  for $329, in addition to the new laptops. Nvidia said that more than 70 laptop manufacturers would offer gaming laptops that use the companys next-generation Ampere architecture. Nvidia said its new gaming laptops would be priced at $999 for the RTX 3060 model, $1,299 for the RTX 3070 model, and $1,999 for the RTX 3080 model.\n\nAs many gamers found this past holiday season, however, those list prices were pretty much meaningless as resellers scooped up available RTX 30-series cards and sold them at much higher prices, and remaining 30-series cards were only available from manufacturers who were bundling the cards into pre-made gaming rigs.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-13 13:19:58'] Let‚Äôs be real. No one will be able to get a 3060 just like the last cards. I don‚Äôt think this much supply constraints is good for Nvidia, I think they missed out on GPU sales big time because of all the stock problems. For myself if I didn‚Äôt play VR I would not buy the 3000 cards anymore since I‚Äôve already played cyberpunk at low settings and would‚Äôve just decided to wait for the next cycle.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-14 05:19:15'] Interesting ... "The Nvidia earnings report also included an update of its fiscal Q1 2021 outlook. It is lowering its revenue estimates by $100 million to a new range of $3.00 billion, plus or minus 2%. The reason for this change is possible headwinds due to the coronavirus from China. Wall Street‚Äôs estimate is for revenue of $2.85 billion during the period."

Guide is positive.  Upcoming chips sound good.  This is pretty much the dream ER.  I would have thought it would be up even more than 6% in this environment.  Some analysts saw $297-338.

Really bullish on YouTube Shorts and the cloud portion becoming profitable. AMZN - Pretty bullish on AWS, not that knowledgeable on the  cloud, but from what I've heard, AWS is definitely the best out of it's competitors. I think the retail business will become more profitable soon too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 11:35:56'] LEU- they just won a contract to produce high enrichment uranium in America. This is a valuable power source and until now is entirely produced in Russia. So the US government is basically building them a factory to start production. XPOF- they own a number of boutique fitness brands (think club pilates, pure Barre, etc.). They operate a franchise model, so they are asset light. They keep rapidly expanding too, domestically and internationally. CLH- they collect industrial waste. As more factories are onshoring, they stand to gain big. CECO- they make environmental control equipment. They are in the process of making the business a less cyclical, higher recurring revenue company. Interesting play on industrialization.

UUUU - They are upgrading their uranium mill to process REE. They will be the only ones in the US to process mozanite sand, due to being radioactive, which has much better margins.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 15:43:26'] No offense, but you've got a peak Reddit portfolio - mega cap tech corps.Look to diversify your holdings into other sectors and market caps (it's a lot less of a lift for a $100M market cap company to grow 10% than it is for a $100B company). Defense - China and Russia are arguably going to cause further ramp ups in defense spending. Look at major aircraft, drones, and ships. Credit Services - Americans spend money. and so on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 18:42:01'] 3-5 years isn't long-term in my books, but AMZN, MSFT, CRM GOOG all seem reasonable if you're looking for large cap tech names.As a decade long play I think SHOP is interesting, but I probably wouldn't buy it over $35.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 12:29:05'] 3-5 years, GNRC.  They have lots of temporary problems dragging them down now.  So buying at bottom or near bottom. But US power grid is not keeping up with demand.  It is easily disrupted due to storms, wild fires and heat waves which are getting worse.  It is also a target for hackers as hostilities with China, N Korea and Russia escalate. Good chance we will see prolonged power outage happen more frequently. This will drive high demand for generators in the next five to ten years.

I've mainly been looking for companies with sustainable competitive advantages and a strong piece of the market share pie.  Some of my recent buys have been Lenovo, Daqo New Energy, Adobe, and Lam Research.  Lam did get some recent bad news with the US restrictions on exports to China but still think they're well positioned for growth with the complexity of their chips.

I feel investors should really start looking outside the US. it's just a matter of time before the dollar collapses. Latin America is where I'm setting my eye. Also I'm Keeping an eye on the small cap CSV. It's a funeral service company that's aggressively aquiring all the mom and pop funeral homes. It's been really beat up recently. For chips I've been doing well with LAM research  and KlAC. It makes more sense to me to look into the Semiconductor equipment manufacturers. In trying to stick with a 15 or less holdings portfolio.

Talking about having 1mio, level 5 autonomous cars on the streets by 2021 and the new hardware, drawing pointless comparisons to other chips that dont even fall in the same category.Not only is that sheer number laughable considering Teslas finances and production capabilities, its also absolutely unrealistic. Remember: So far Tesla have tested exactly 0 (ZERO) miles of autonomous driving in California. Musk is grasping at straws again, after lots all around the states are filling up with unbought Teslas and the company is financially overexposed. In fact, unless he finds new financing, cashflow is gonna dry up in summer this year already.At the event he also said that he's commiting 100% of Teslas current capital to autonomous driving from now on - which means he atleast admitted to canceling Roadster 2, Semi, Pickup and Model Y. Couple of his other promises that of course never came true.Also a variant of the new 14 nm hardware was first introduced in an iphone in 2015. In Elons "vision" powering 144 TeraOPS at <100 W, while NVidias Drive AGX Pegasus is ALREADY pulling 320 TOPS at <70 Watt and 10 nm.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-20 17:04:37'] Not saying this is wrong, and might certainly come true.It might even come true because of totally different factors such as the fact techs are so plumply valued right now that letting a little air out of the bubble wouldn't be that shocking.  We also have the scenario that Nov 20 encompasses the election event.However, as a counterpoint to all of his analysis about how much Nvidia is paying for sales, he's ignoring the effect that can happen when one absorbs a competitor.  At that point you're not just buying a revenue stream, your altering the marketplace.  That's a way that big and mean players get to become even bigger and meaner, as they get to write their own rules.  Maybe they steer things so that buyers who used to be financially efficient using ARM designs no longer can do that, and have to switch do buying higher margin products.  Or any of hundreds of other tactics.  I recall a friend who bought two direct flooring competitors in one region, one selling ultra high end and one selling low end.  They each made 100k per quarter.  Even though they didn't really have overlapping customers, by owning both and accentuating the difference instead of minimizing it, combined they made 300k per quarter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 19:22:35'] Where do investors go from here? Great day today, now what? We still have high inflation, fed raises, war in Ukraine. Every rally to date has been wiped out. If you are an investor, buy quality and add to it. If you are a trader pay attention to the technicals, chart patterns, VIX.No one will ring a bell at the top or bottom of this market. Information is your best ammunition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 21:37:49'] Profit taking and down. We don‚Äôt see run ups like this and big money not profit take. Tomorrow will be down depending on what profit taking happens
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:36:37'] I just literally keep adding, every month, regardless. Eventually a bull market will arise and I'll be doing just fine. If you're in it for the long haul don't pay too much attention to these swings and just keep buying.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:30:08'] Probably a rally for a week or two and continuing the selloff
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 21:10:37'] I'd be surprised if we didn't at least get a slight pull back in the morning after the bell but the market will most likely end the day green. There isn't any other data coming out soon to sway the market until the next month's FOMC meeting and cpi numbers. If the next fed meeting goes well and we only raise rates a half point and then the cpi numbers come out confirming that inflation is in fact starting to fall, than there will be a huge probability that we see an end to this bear market. I'm not convinced yet, as Powell's last meeting didn't show any sign of him budging, mid terms elections are pretty much over with no "red wave", and keep in mind there is a real possibility that the next numbers might actually come in hot. So in other words, we go up or down. But seriously, be patient and keep your eye on the news.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:45:31'] I think inflation is abating due to low levels of consumer savings and improved supply chain logistics (in addition to interest rate hikes obviously). As long as the fed backs off the rate hikes before crashing the economy I think things could actually end well

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:07:28'] Spy broke through 3900 which was an important hurdle so it may retest 3900 today and face stiff resistance at 4k so i guess today we trade between these two levels.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 19:41:59'] Probably low volume of retail fomoing to send it higher. Maybe we get a dip but I‚Äôm not expecting a rug pull since it‚Äôs a banking holiday and most institutions will be closed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:57:30'] I think the general consensus is that this isn‚Äôt going to last, and doesn‚Äôt have any legs‚Ä¶ which is probably right. There‚Äôs a severe resistance level above formed by the upper band of the descending channel on the SPX. Technically, we‚Äôre almost certain to be headed for the 100 short term. After that, I know 4100 is on the top end of a lot of analysts range‚Ä¶ good resistance at 3900-3915. If we get two closes about that level it‚Äôs higher to that 41 handle, but if it‚Äôs rejected then we pause until next months data.. possible PCE or FOMC as a catalyst before that. Ultimately though, we should be down to 3200 in a realistic world. Lots of forward expectations have to work out perfectly for these values to be justified historically.Having said all that: tomorrow? Something in me says we should be lower for consolidation. But the indexes hit the highs of the day on the close; there are simply no more sellers and the buyers have taken control. Most people are expecting a consolidation day, and there‚Äôs still a lot of pessimism and bearishness‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôll say big up day tomorrow. +2.5% $COMP +1.8% $SPX +350 on the Dow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 22:03:33'] Guys chill, inflation was still high af

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 21:44:45'] 7.9% expected and 7.7% actual can only equal the 12th-best day in history if you have a bunch of people who have little experience that just entered the market 2 years ago.  We still have a long way to go, even if tomorrow extends the rally.  I am going to do some sector rotation in my portfolio by year-end but today isn't going to affect my outlook.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 23:01:51'] the market fundamentals have not changed.  we are in a recession and jpow is still going to increase the federal funds rate at the next meeting.  the move up was way too aggressive based on the cpi print.  this is algorithmic trading at work.  big bump at 8am then range based the rest of the day.  bear rally.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 12:30:53'] > Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has had a 1% tax rate and average pretax profit of $1.8 billion.  This is so disingenous. [AMD lost money every year between 2011 and 2019.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMD/amd/financial-statements)Do you know why their current tax rate is so low? They're still recouping and recovering from eight consecutive years of multi-million dollar losses. Loss carryforwards from the past reduce your present tax liability because your losses offset your earnings.I love when people who struggle with basics of finance suddenly become tax geniuses when they think they can gouge a corporation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 11:20:39'] Good theory, but this new tax doesn‚Äôt really stop companies from reporting rates below 15%. I doubt their tax liabilities will change all that much
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 12:55:57']  Companies have spent almost $4B in lobbying. I am sure it‚Äôs not to push for more taxes and regulations in themselves.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 22:36:39'] Last time these companies got that huge tax break all they did was use the extra money for stock buybacks rather than raise employee salaries or capital investments.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 13:11:01'] This stuff is always talked about in such a disingenuous way. The way these companies get their tax rates down so low is because they carry forward and write off losses and/or are able to write off business investments like R&D and expansionsI mean if you don't want companies to be able to do these things then say it, at least then people will know how decisions like this affect job growth, prices, and innovation. Instead it is all a big wealth envy circle jerk (which probably is not an accident)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 11:11:15'] Can't they mitigate the cost by passing it on to the consumer like with tariffs?This is probably going to kill the strategy of making big profits then reinvesting almost all of it to get a really low tax bill.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 14:29:46'] Corporations will not pay the tax in the end. Consumers, hence taxpayers will. Inventors, industrialists, and entrepreneurs got to where they are because they paid the price up front by risking their own livelihood and welfare, innovating, sacrificing their resources up-front, leading others to produce, etc. They gathered others, the people, to become employees, because those employees obviously couldn‚Äôt and still can‚Äôt do what they did to get to where they are. The workers, the people, the consumers, the ones that the companies employed, got them there, but it was the leaders/owners of those companies that hit the employees there. Corporations begin with one to a few determined people. It will be the people, the employees, the workers, that will keep the companies running by paying taxes for those companies. Yes, those same employees will pay the taxes on behalf of the companies. The money will just be redistributed by politicians, lawmakers, scam artists, liars, thieves, they are. Democrats never get the fact that corporate heads aren‚Äôt idiots. That‚Äôs right. We all know The Democratic Party is the ‚Äútax more, toll more, and take more party.‚Äù Businesses will move their companies out of the country, or just sell to foreign investors and cash out. Read Atlas Shrugged. Producers quit when their resources are taken. Champions stop playing the game when you make rules so that ‚Äúeveryone wins.‚Äù If they stay in business after being levied a 15% corporate tax, they will increase prices to cover inflation, thus driving inflation higher. A friend of ours showed us a receipt from a restaurant last weekend that had a new charge on it, ‚ÄúTemporary Inflation Fee.‚Äù Hmm. Who‚Äôs paying that? The restaurant? No the customer is. The rich are rich because they are always smart to figure out how to get out of paying more, whether it be taxes or more for their raw materials, if they are manufacturers. If restaurants pay more for food and fuel, they increase prices. As stupid as Trump was and is, he said something very honest that every successful business tycoon knows, but doesn‚Äôt have the balls to say, ‚ÄúPaying less taxes doesn‚Äôt make me a bad person. It makes me smart.‚Äù Do you want to give more of your money to the US government and let them manage it? Really. How good of a job have they been doing the last 20 years or so? We would be in jail if we stole like they do. The deficit is like an out of control water meter, spinning endlessly. The hydrant is open full blast and it‚Äôs flowing dollars with high pressure. WE are the source of those dollars. The American workers. So, WE will pay those corporate taxes. Not the corporations. Votes to raise taxes are votes to speed up the bleeding process toward the death of a democracy. Free childcare, healthcare, education, job training, food, gas, housing, etc, etc. Free? Who‚Äôs paying the bill? We are. We‚Äôre paying with our freedom to generate more money by giving more tax money to dishonest, disloyal, and disgusting people. Remember something‚Ä¶‚ÄùCompanies make money. Politicians take money.‚Äù Politicians produce nothing, but policies filled with words. Words that further enslave the ones ‚Äúfor whom the policies are written.‚Äù

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 09:52:13'] Nvidia won‚Äôt benefit from the CHIPS act because they get all their chips manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan. If it was Intel, Texas Instruments, GloFo or Micron this would matter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 11:25:57'] Is there any information on when he purchased the call options and what the expiry was?If he purchased long term calls a year or two ago, and they were set to expire soon, it's logical that he may exercise them regardless of what is going on in the world... seems strange that this is blowing up. This easily could be a weird coincidence.Don't get me wrong, I hate congress insider trading more than most, but this seems like purposeful misinformation to spread a narrative. He didn't go out and buy 20,000 shares. He exercised 200 call options, which we don't know how long he has held or when they are expiring.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 12:09:52'] I don‚Äôt understand how this affects stocks like Nvidia or AMD. They don‚Äôt manufacture any chips so they don‚Äôt get anything from the bill. The biggest beneficiaries will be Intel and Micron cause they actually have factories and it was already confirmed they will receive a lot of the subsidies. Most of this just seems like a lot of momentum trading and nothing fundamental on why these companies should be moving the way they are other then momentum and psychology that Pelosi‚Äôs husband bought Nvidia. I am staying away.

Like shit I don't doubt that he's had plays where he got additional information due to his proximity to Pelosi, and I don't think that's cool but it's not like I can prove it either. If people want to actually make it against the law for this to happen then reach out and petition your representative like actual participants in our democracy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 16:56:42'] Does this sub understand that exercising a call option DOES not alter your exposure to market changes in a position? If you own a call option at $100 and exercise that option you buy the stock at $100. So if you have an option and the prices to $110 per share your gain is $10 per share, the same as if you own the shares outright. When non-stories like this gain traction it detracts from actual issues with Congress‚Äôs record of insider trading and shady deals.TL;DR You stand to gain the same amount from exercising call options as if you owned the stock outright.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 17:09:06'] US wanting to make its own chips is not a news story - anyone could see this coming.

The CHIPS act is for semiconductors manufacturers, Nvidia is a fabless designer (TSMC manufactures for them) and won‚Äôt benefit from the bill.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 10:51:32'] I think OP is getting mixed up. The article mentions:>Intel's Xe discrete GPUs are a new generation of graphics processors introduced in late 2020 and early 2021.Those are not the same as the ARC models released last year to compete with mid range GPUs. The Xe are scaled up versions of their integrated cards, I thought even the Xe ones were integrated. Rumors I heard was ARC was cancelled cause they lose their 1200 developers in Russia. Intel has always had a lead in GPUs since many of their CPUs now ship with an integrated GPU which is good enough for most ppl. Its the dGPU market where their share is 0, and the Xe GPUs are also not sold for desktops, its only for laptops/prebuilt systems:[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/discrete-gpus/iris-xe-aic.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/discrete-gpus/iris-xe-aic.html)&#x200B;You can't go to Bestbuy and buy these things, so its not really a true stat just like how Intel sells the most GPUs annually since all their CPUs come with one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 06:24:56'] I think Intel is approaching a market that has consistently overcharged on their prices during the COVID and Mining pandemic, leading to an infuriarted consumer demographic. Intel is coming to the rescue by providing 'budget GPU's' at low cost, but good cost/performance ratio. Intel's GPU don't weigh up against AMD or Nvidia in terms of quality, but they took a perfect time to enter the market to fill a budget-niche. I am hopeful they can expand it in the future

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 08:02:35'] I just built a PC and although I went NVDA for my GPU, the Intel offering was very interesting. I didn‚Äôt want to take the early adopter risk, but if they can prove durability and keep costs relatively low they could really do some damage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 06:37:56'] Intel's dGPU (Dedicated GPU) release was such a dumpster fire that they canned the majority of future dGPU products, realigned the company's reporting to NOT have the AXG (graphics) division report its standalone revenue and earnings, and demoted the guy who was running the group.Their overly ambitious data center GPU (Ponte Vecchio) still hasn't been released and when it is, won't even beat out AMDs last-gen MI250X. It's already behind NVDAs H100 and AMDs forthcoming MI300.There *may* be reasons to choose INTC over AMD/NVDA, but I personally do not believe anything low-end, low-margin graphics-related should be in that conversation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 11:39:40'] I really wonder why this market share was only taken from amd and not the overall gpu market ? did nvidia stay put at respective levels ?  4 % in less than 6 months is... quiet a lot, especially considering how "stable" the market in terms of market share really seems to be (or was)
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 01:18:53'] No.And I say that as an Intel shareholder. Intel has seemingly killed off the consumer GPU unit already due to the overall economic conditions. They entered at the wrong time, a time they need to reduce expenses and not blow a lot of money into delayed releases and bad drivers. Intel needs a few more iterations to get the GPU right, but they also need the money in the current economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 07:24:54'] There's a huge market section, VDI, that is currently controlled by Nvidia.  However, Nvidia has been charging corp. an arm and a leg for vGPU.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 12:29:50'] >so what do you think?can Intel new GPU change everything in the chip market?High quality content here folks. IMO, no. Intel is taking a beating in the CPU market (which it used to completely dominate) and the GPU market is already fairly satisfied with Nvidia and AMD. Another competitor never hurts as far as the consumer is concerned, but I personally would never gamble on an Intel GPU and I expect they'll give up after a generation or two of poor sales.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 06:38:23'] If I recall well, intel is making these in third party fabs? If correct and can push to their fabs, perhaps they might be able to squeeze even better margins.Btw this is the most encouraging news for intel in quite some time.For nvidia, I doubt, they are way too advanced in ai for intel to compete. Maybe in low tier gpus but even there nvidia hopes to push gforce now in couple years (I already see it bundled with tvs) which will make these low level gpus irrelevant for anyone with good internet connection. So market they target is more in amd part.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 07:00:32'] I wouldn't say too late, but there's a bunch of lessons I learned that I wish I had learned earlier. Two examples:* Plans mean nothing, all that matters is execution. I invested in a small company with a great product and huge plans, but scaling up production is difficult and when it didn't work out, the stock dropped 90%. Likewise, there are plenty of companies (*cough* GM *cough*) that are talking about their plans everyday, but not executing whatsoever and going bankrupt as a result. So the lesson here is that, unless a company has an amazing track record of executing on plans, look at what they're doing, not what they say they will do.* Unlike what people say around here, diversifying by owning more stocks is not safer. As a retail investor, and especially when just starting out, you don't have time to truly follow more than a handful of companies. It's much safer to own 1 or 2 stocks you know really well, than 10 stocks you only know the basics of.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 14:25:04'] So I'm just a novice, but this is advice I get frommy successful father every time I try and talkstocks with him. People only enjoy tradingbecause they enjoy money. It is an unnaturalprofession. People enjoy hobby's via theirpassions.... Woodworking, skiing, cooking, etc. allof which can never be fully mastered and onemay spend a lifetime pursuing greatness in.Stocks on the other hand, are not interesting atall, well atleast to 99.99999% of the population,even 99.999% of an educated population, theONLY reason it is popular is because SOMEpeople make money doing it. So his point is, ifone can never be too good at something, whywaste the time and energy on something thatisn't your passion? The opportunity cost ofinvesting in individual stocks is that it takes timeand money away from perfecting your actualcraft, hobby, or profession. A boat craftsmanloses out on his primary skills every second hewastes trying to understand the stock market,especially "better" than others. Why not invest inthe S&P 500 and never look at stocks, and beable to advance your self personally andprofessionally, become more skilled, and live andenjoyable fulfilling life. Instead of reading 10k'sand worrying all the time. It's that simple.Specialize, find what you like or you are good atand grind endlessly at it. Stop and enjoy life,pursue new skills. There are some brainiacs thatgenuinely enjoy trading and finance, but from mypersonal opinion there are less of those in theworld than there are people in this sub. So yeah,take it from my main man, and myself trying tofollow on his footsteps. Enjoy life, never stopgrinding, pursue your passions, and don't let distractions get to you, because unless you're aprofessional, even investing can be a distraction.Good luck to all of you.

So yes these companies own Nvidia but if you own any number of stock so do you. As long as Nvidia keeps the majority of it's holdings Nvidia runs the show.

I personally think now is a good time to get the full position and not touch it for long time regardless of how market moves.

NVDA is a mature and modern company as well so there's stability in that.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-16 17:12:15'] all of the big tech stocks are due for an even bigger correction than they have already had. So far, the correction has only erased one month of gains. Let me say that again, one month. In the big scheme of things, one month of gains is nothing.So I fully expect that Apple, Nvidia, and the other giants Will at some point in the next couple of years take a big hit. They could easily go down 30%. But here's the problem, they could go up by another 50% before they do that.I like NVDA for the long term, definitely. But if you buy it now, be prepared to go underwater for a while at some point. If you really are in it for the long haul, you could buy it or dollar cost average into it and just never look at it ever again until you retire.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 20:14:48'] When investing in semiconductor companies look at % of revenues to different regions. China is a higher risk revenue region and the revenues should be discounted at a higher rate. KLAC does 29%. AMAT does 36%. LRCX does 31%. ASML does 17%.NVDA does 24% and AMD does 25% however their billing location doesn't match the end customer i.e. Chinese vendors then sell their product to other countries. I doubt more than 10% of their revenues are to China.The company with the least China exposure is TSM with only 10%. US customers make 64% of their revenue.

Just because a company is banned from importing our stuff directly doesn't mean a 3rd party can't buy and resell it, though this still isn't as easy as it may seem.For those who think this will just incentivize China to make their own bleeding edge chips, I'd say there's a reason that their military hardware like their J20 jet or this supposed new clone of the B2 bomber is still nowhere near ours.

And the US fought hard to make sure it happened.Xi changed all that.Just a few months ago, I would've said for sure he'd get his 3rd term next month. But now? I'm not so sure. It's still likely, but perhaps less certain.I hope for a near future when Xi gets the boot and China's like, "sorry, y'all, we're ok with just getting rich."

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 07:49:25'] Tech grew like crazy over the last few years because interest rates were low. They were able to borrow money for near free to put towards r&d and production. Now that interest rates are up, I don‚Äôt think these companies have as much room to grow in the near term. Not advice, I‚Äôm just a random internet dude.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 06:43:16'] Just buy QQQM if you want tech stocks
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 11:21:08'] I agree, people say Tech wont grow as fast as before, might be true however I think Google PE19 will grow more than coca cola PE27, tech starting to look fairly valued.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 17:57:41'] Honestly, NO ONE knows. But, like the overall sentiment in this thread, AAPL, MSFT and GOOGLE are going to be fine over the next 5-10 years. Are they going to double every 2-3 years? No. But, they have loads of cash and they have created ecosystems resulting in continuous income. Folks comparing these to Cisco, IBM etc in 2000s don't understand.I think we are at a point where a meaningful portfolio would be one where there is a good tech presence and a whole lot of non-tech bluechips.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 09:35:05'] I like MSFT, GOOGL, VOO and SCHD all in 25% amounts. Get massive exposure to two companies that I think are the future and 50% of my portfolio is index or safer dividend investments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 05:53:11'] I think GOOGL, AAPL and MSFT will do pretty good. The earnings may not do so well in the next year or two, but the price decline seems to be near a bottom of a U-shaped curve where the price probably will start increasing in a year or so. But try to diversify into a number of industries. The total tech shouldn't be more than 33 percent.

However Apple, Microsoft and Google would probably do fine. Chances are high however that growth relatively quickly stalls here. The pandemic pulled growth forward and we are already seeing a slowdown in that growth now. Just stay away from Nvidia at current prices. Operating Earnings down 77% last quarter, QoQ Growth in Datacenters is stalling and it trades at 3x historic multiple when they had good 15% growth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 04:52:49'] No. There's a good chance that we are seeing a regime change - people continuing to rely on "what worked over the last decade" may be disappointed.People should have a reasonable % of their portolio in tech, not have a tech fund. It's not no tech, but maybe you have 20-25% of your portfolio in tech (S and P 500 is about 24% tech), not 100% or anything remotely near that. Additionally, I think even with technology there has to be a little bit of a move away from the giant "household names"; some tech exposure should be finding medium sized tech names that are working/can work in this environment. I don't own it but look at Aspen Technology, which is up this year because of what it focuses on - look at the industries on its website who are the customers and look what industries have done better this year. The stock has also done pretty well over the last couple decades. You can have some major household names as tech exposure, but branch out a bit. Doesn't have to be that, but there are some things in tech that are working. The era of easy monetary policy that powered a lot of tech gains over the last decade isn't coming back for a while, which Powell restated yesterday. Not something I'm thrilled with but if that's the case people have to adapt. I'd love for this to be a period where we get through it, the pivot happens and the growth party starts again but the longer this goes on the more unrealistic that feels/I don't see the conditions coming together for that happening. Feels like best case is the eventual recovery looks more 2002 post dot com.Worth a read - https://citywire.com/pro-buyer/news/nothing-is-always-good-rajiv-jain-s-warning-for-growth-pms/a2391677 ("‚ÄòNothing is always good‚Äô: Rajiv Jain‚Äôs warning for growth PMs")

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 06:21:07'] If you have a long time horizon you definitely (most likely) make money at these levels. How long before they outperform? I think within 3 years. Maybe sooner. There is never a guarantee on any individual stock or any sector but those companies are strong and provide great products. I don't think their competitors are that close.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 08:11:12'] if you did that at the beginning of the year you'd be down like 60%. Next year will be massive layoffs, there's much more room to fall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 10:04:09'] Tech stocks can flatline for long periods of time and I mean years.  Go back 20 years and look how long Microsoft was flat and even Amazon.   A lot of stock strategists believe Tech is not going to lead the market in returns for the next decade.   I tend to agree because realistically what are their growth rates for the next 10 years?   Will it be higher or lower than the last 10 years?  If you think lower than don't invest it these.  If you think higher then buy these and hold for the next decade.  Myself, I am underweight technology because I don't see how they are going to replicate their past growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 05:56:40'] We‚Äôre in stagflation and the next leap in productivity is unironically AI robots, aggressive solar expansion. So if I wanted a risk portfolio I‚Äôd choose the leaders in those two.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 12:04:55'] I would be careful assuming the future will resemble the past.  Big tech was over owned and could be on sale for years.  For example, look at the Swiss National Bank.  They still own hundreds of B worth of big US tech stocks.  Unwinding that position will be a slow and painful process.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 15:40:52'] Depends on your timeframe. Could these 4 stocks beat the market over a 1 month holding period? Sure.Can these 4 beat the market over the next 10 years? Almost certainly not

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 11:49:33'] I don't think that there's going to be major reshoring across the board but I do think that there's going to be reshoring for some things. Near-shoring (moving to Mexico, for example) seems more likely imo.If we do get a fair amount of reshoring in the US, I think what will benefit most will likely be things that are fairly boring on the surface. WSC is a small name that I think will - where there's construction projects there's going to be mobile/modular offices.  I think if companies move supply chain to Mexico, CP (if the KSU deal is approved), UNP and OMAB, among others.

They both failed. US suppliers dropped the ball. One can add all productivity $ newly made in US last few years and compare that to gdp.  I suspect the reshoring effort increase will be minimal.TSMC used to have at least 2 wafer plants in East Coast. Supplier chain, high utilitity and wage cost forced it moved to Asia. Even the tax incentive being in US did not offset the huge cost variance.Automation and robots has actually centered in Asia for decades. These countries are strong in robotics. 1. Singapore, 2. South Korea, 3. Japan, 4. Germany, 5. Sweden, 6. Denmark, 7. Taiwan, 8. Belgium; 9. USA.  Japan has the heaviest concentration of robots. The robots are actually assembled by other robots. They are used in restaurants and worked like cooks. It uses 724 robots per 10,000 workers. South Korea now has more 630 robots, Taiwan has 325 robots.  #9 US uses just 200 robots per 10,000 workers. My robot stocks from some best small companies have a -38% rtn YTD performance.What may florish are some companies with strong North American presence in Canada, southwest, mid-west.

Mexico is the future for most new factory jobs coming to North America. There will be some niche industry's that move into the US, particularly energy intensive ones such as battery production (especially with the Inflation Reduction Act). I could definitely see states with low electricity rates, such as Texas, taking advantage of America's relative energy security. I suspect that much of Europe's energy intensive industries will essentially decamp from the continent and accelerate factory development in the US. Europe is a couple of decades behind Japan in this, but their demographics are similar and energy security virtually non-existent.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 06:19:49'] I think there are very powerful economic and political forces that will resist any widespread reshoring. Widespread reshoring will only happen in the short term with some pretty drastic populist protectionist legislation and will result in a large drop in the return of capital. Not only do I believe this will have a dramatic impact on the economy overall, more importantly the oligarchic nature of American Politics will strongly resist this happening, I think they would rather risk a populist revolution than allow populist legislation to pass, at least that has been the trend of history.If we can keep the boat of western democracy afloat and climate change doesn't cause to much of a crisis, in time reshoring will gradually happen as wages and standards of living reach some sort of equilibrium across the globe. This mean a reduction in real wages in western democracy in and an increase in developing nations.Personally I think we are screwed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 08:51:08'] As a data point, I'm 28. I find the metaverse weird, and won't personally use it until it is very very commercial. But I think generations to come may adapt this pretty heavily and quickly. I think this is just the next evolution in the web ecosystem. For the record, I have 0 shares in META and probably won't invest. However, I'm heavily invested in semiconductors that are projected to help fuel this jet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:30:04'] There is a new show in Netflix called "the future of". The gaming episode covers the metaverse to some degree. It's quite interesting and rather scary at the same time. Meta, among others, is working towards mapping the entire world. Inside buildings, homes, etc. As well as the outside world. In an effort to have an augmented reality "world" that you can view in real time with whoever is with you. Be it friends or strangers in the same physical location. I'm sure this doesn't cover everything, but its what I recall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:14:07'] It's not about metaverse being a mega hit. It's about Facebook being early enough to establish monopoly from the beginning and have complete control over a platform.All of their businesses rely on platform's (iOS, Android, Windows) consent to track users. If they mamage to catch VR, they will be safe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 08:51:29'] Those are valid concerns, but what you are missing is that it won‚Äôt stay that way. When we get regular sized glasses that are VR much of these problems will be solved. Not just meta but apple is focusing on this too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:21:43'] I remember attending one of the first Oculus events after Facebook purchased them. One thing multiple founders of Oculus mentioned repeatedly is that when a person has a positive experience in VR, meaning they truly experience presence with no motion sickness, then they will crave returning to that experience. In other words, when VR is done right, it will become addictive. I believe Zuckerberg also believes that which is why he is pumping billions of dollars into it. For the record, I don‚Äôt believe the tech is there yet, and I think Zuck knows that too. But when it is, there‚Äôs no chance in hell companies won‚Äôt capitalize on something addictive. On the flip side, the tech may not ever get to that next level, and just remain a gimmick. Investing in VR is gamble at this point, but if you do invest, plan to hold long term with the expectations that you may lose your investment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:10:41'] I think it will be extremely useful in areas such as engineering and medicine. Flight simulators are already a huge part of educating future pilots or gaming fans. Imagine scanning a person and then having their anatomy reconstructed in front of you to view for surgical practice. All those do it yourself YouTube fixes for washing machines and lawn mowers can be converted to AR or VR so you can actively see which parts to take off and repair step by step in your field of view. Being able to walk around something (engineering) and view it from different angles and interact with it and zoom in on it from the comfort of your house would be a massive educational tool. Yes you can do these things in person, but having a fully functional virtual airplane that has a complete working engine and all engine parts that you can practice working on and having the ability to autoscrew something in or remove panelling with the flick of your wrist and reset it to how it was before you started tinkering with it with the simplicity of a menu button click. Possibilities are quite literally endless for AR/VR.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:07:40'] Because people are becoming antisocial and don't really know how to communicate face to face, so why not capitalize on that market?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:00:34'] I'd imagine some uses for meta/omni verse via VR/AR that I would enjoy such as:* Visiting historical sites or natural wonders.* Go to a virtual "pet store" and just hangout with some puppies.* Go on a VR tour of the sea. I actually do this on Youtube and it's not bad.* See how new clothing might look on me on a AR store.* Taking a 15 minute break in my VR headset looking at a beautiful forest or other nature scenes.* Playing some COD, Minecraft, medieval fantasy D&D type of games would be great.* Check out a potential piece of real estate.These are some offerings that Meta, Nvidia, Photoshop, Unity, and Microsoft have envisioned. I would probably be willing to pay a $400 headset up front, and a monthly $30-50 fee to have access to good versions of these. (And probably $50-100 one time fee for good games).Is Meta the one that will win here? Not necessarily. I think Nvidia and Apple are just as likely if not more likely to come out ahead. I'm bullish on AR/VR in general, and have some invested in Meta.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:08:00'] VR and AR have a future. META is making sure it will play a part in that future by sucking in most of the VR talent in the market. Even if the metaverse fails, there will be a market for VR headsets, VR gloves and similar devices (Meta bought Oculus). Apple is also expanding into this direction, which means they both expect a profitable environment. Innovation keeps companies alive, I think META has the right idea.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:25:12'] Zuck is right, but a bit early. That being said, once it takes off, Meta will be way ahead of everyone. Companies will be rushing to figure out how to beat or integrate with the Meta Metaverse. The R&D investments Meta is making now are going to propel us into the next internet in the same way the FB made social media a mainstay, the key question is how soon Meta can profit from it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:16:02'] I know there are a lot of counter arguments here, but I wholly agree with your opinion OP.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 08:46:47'] There's a thing called VRChat.  It has many flaws.   It is so much better than the metaverse, and no floating torsos...and it's free.I think Zuckerberg has lost his mind in his desperate attempt to draw non-old people.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:42:43'] The ultimate maturation of the meta verse will be when your meetings will be 3D including all subtle facial expressions. Workplace personas and avatars will often be actual people without any augmented changes. You‚Äôll attend a live show and struggle to know if the band is live or projected.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:54:35'] read a book talking about digital worlds. Said right now the big problems is the metaverse doesn't fully take off until there are neural links. Out put is the problem, how do you transfer all your brain info into a virtual world, it becomes inefficient. Once neural output devices (that basically read your brainwaves) are mainstream, the metaverse takes off to what these guys think. That being said I don't think we are that far.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-24 08:11:37'] If the headsets advance to the point of being slim and stylish with solid pass through AR the next generation will latch on as their version of mom jeans, fidget spinners and hover boards - and youll be called a boomer for a post like this... theyll wear them everywhere because you can see with them better than your own eyes.   Gen Z will be shaking their canes at it saying "Kids these days!"... but that'll just make them want it more.  Millennials will finally have their Gen X moment and be able to say "see, you feel old too!".  And if that doesnt happen, It's already started to show potential to revolutionize gaming and casual fitness. Each Gen will test a new use case and perfect or monetize an old one that was proven out.  How far and where it goes will determine if it becomes the type of cash cow meta is dreaming of above. Theyre clearly shooting for something like that with this positioning though -  currently it's proving concept but largely costing meta money and feeding steam revenue.  Zuk doesn't have a bad track record and he's far from the only one betting on there being enough of a cance of this not just being the gimmicky trend stuck in the early 2020s zeitgeist to put some resources amd tallent into it.  Is it really a worse moon shot than self driving cars?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:27:16'] I don't see it yet either, but many much more tech-savvy people than myself with better visions of the future see it and that's worth a lot more.> I do not see how it can be more attractive than just regular video chats where you see the actual person.This reeks of "why would people need a portable phone when they can just call you back when they get home?" or "why would people need a touch screen in their portable phone when buttons work fine?"Perhaps it won't work out, but in a world that's becoming increasingly digitised I won't be surprised at all if it will.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:49:02'] I'm not going to do the research and math behind it but obviously Zuck thinks the probability weighted DCF is worth burning money. The way I'd go about calculating it is you say it'll take x years to get setup, another x years to build up a user base, and x years to begin monetizing. Let's say 7, 5, and 2 years. Now I would calc a DCF to that point in time 14 years from now. And within that DCF I would discount each of those CFs by my estimated probably of the metaverse actually taking off. So I'm my assumptions before that point I would build my DCF as if it is fact that the metaverse will be a thing in the future.Now that I have my NPV for the meatsverse 14 years from today I would estimate all of the costs leading up to that point, bring all the cashflows back (do not discount the capital outlays by probably because those will 100% happen since Zuck is 100% certain he wants to pursue the project (revenues can fail, costs don't, if anything they will be higher than anticipated)) and badabing badaboom you've got the NVP of the metaverse which Zuck obviously thinks is worthwhileSomething to note is that this is a project Zuck is very passionate about and his underlying assumptions shouldn't be trusted because he is looking through rose tinted glasses.But let's say bull case does come true and the world falls in love with the metaverse similar to the Ernest Cline novel "Ready Player One", the value of owning the virtual world that everyone has adopted is astronomical. Cosmetic micro transactions, transaction fees for third party developers to sell within your metaverse (like how apple and Google charge for transactions on their app stores), premium access, ad space within an infinitely large virtual world, hardware sales. If it takes off there is a lot of money to be made. Bear case, you spent a lot of money to develop really good VR tech that you can probably sell/license to try and recoup costs but I doubt it would make enough to justify the spend
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:08:29'] A lot of those kinds of assets are likely trash, similar to crypto and comics in the 90's, they're a speculation tool. Digital land and things like that are very unlikely to pan out unless they somehow get attached to something else that people value. They're a gamble, for now.WFH will likely increase significantly in the coming decades and having casual bump-in interactions with people will be something that we have to simulate. In that way the metaverse stuff makes sense, but is so fresh that it's unclear who will lead that revolution. It's unlikely to be an established company. The biggest horse breeder of the 19th century didn't become the biggest car manufacturer of the 20th century. I doubt the creators of an application for self gratification will ultimately create the algorithms that will spark meaningful conversations and collaborative innovation. If they could do that, I think they already would've.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-24 05:41:44'] Your edit and overall sentiment about the response to your post are stupid. If someone knew what could/would make the metaverse explode like the internet then why would they disclose that on this sub?! Just because you do not see the inherent value of the metaverse does not mean it does not have value. Unseen or unestablished value is still value. Asking internet people to be specific about how the metaverse is going to blow up is a stupid thing to ask on a public online forum
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:47:38'] It's new tech.  It's too difficult to understand the innovations and concepts that will be developed over the next 10-20-30 years that make it excel.When the internet started, it seemed like the only practical application was porn and shitty webpage blogs.  I'd argue it was smartphones in the late 2000s that blew it up and enabled much larger adoption.Streaming any video, show or movie.  Ordering practically anything with 24 hour delivery.  Scrolling through dating profiles.  Modifying your cell phone plan with a click of a button.  Setting up meetings or appointments using video conferencing.  And so much more wasn't imaginable in 1995.You have to have some "imagination" or allow for a scope of growth to be factored into all this.Like any disruptive tech, it's hard to imagine the possibilities because they don't exist yet.  People shit talked radio, TV, cars, etc. but they evolved to be a staple in everyday life.Maybe brainlink shit is possible in 20-40 years, they already got a monkey to play a simple video game with thought alone.  Would be cool to watch sports using very light weight headset or glasses, from any seat in the area or stadium.  Or walk/run through any territory.  I can honestly see some type of neurolink being possible within 50-100 years, some Ready Player One type shit.  And with how fucked up humans are destroying the earth, more digital experiences could be the way forward.  We're likely working towards the Matrix reality. Don't get caught up on the size of headsets, they will likely improve like 1990's nokias vs 2022 iphones.  The use cases can improve as well, we just can't think of all the possibilities.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:04:41'] The main thing people get wrong about the metaverse is the concept about ‚Äúalternative reality‚Äù. Meta WILL NOT be some immersive other world where you‚Äôre whatever you want to be (a green kitten or whatever).IN REALITY YOU WILL JUMP IN AND OUT OF THE METAVERSE JUST LIKE YOU CHECK YOUR MESSENGER.Metaverse is a fancy PR name for the upcoming improved tech, software and connectivity that will allow for a VR experience in your pocket, just like smartphones gave us PCs in our pockets. Think about Internet before and after the smartphone. It took a big chunk from the total internet usage. The reason - ease of use and availability.When small glasses will be able to give you instant pop-in and out of VR and also very importantly XR (clear view of your surroundings combined with a digital layer) there will be a lot you can do. Work, chat, share funny cat stuff, you name it.The second layer in Facebook‚Äôs meta push is that if there‚Äôs a single ubiquitous metaverse it will have strength to compete with national states in terms of influence. Think why did US block Libra - because it could have challenged the US dollar as an international in-meta currency.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 08:38:19'] No. It‚Äôs a gimmick.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:52:49'] I think you're missing a big point in that A LOT of people in the world are shy and would rather have an animated character as themselves. Like take VR chat as an example.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 08:46:09'] People said the same thing about the internet in the 90s
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 08:46:07'] This is why I recently sold my META at a loss. It‚Äôs become too much of a speculative investment from what I would consider a great business at its core. If Zuck is right about the metaverse all power to him, but it will likely take 100‚Äôs of billions in cash flow and constant reinvestment, where that money could be used in buybacks at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:15:04'] It's not.It's a gimmick that will likely attract children & sick pups who jerk off to anime girls in their VR headsets.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 09:23:13'] The particular job I do requires working with teams, sometimes in the hundreds of professionals that I am not particularly concerned with the minutia of their facial expressions, but having a work environment that we can ultimately be collaborative and ‚Äòtogether‚Äô, yet geographically opposite sides of the world and be productive will be a benefit. I‚Äôm also not particularly bothered about gaming, but virtual worlds for collaboration with like minded professionals is where the money is. Enterprise level virtual worlds.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:30:45'] Metaverse isn't just video chats with avatars. The metaverse is putting on a pair of glasses in the morning so that you can get google maps overlaid on your field of view while you're travelling, make it miles better than a GPS. The metaverse is sitting in an e-cafe with your friends, before deciding to play a VR game together that you can literally walk to from the cafe, and after that going for a walk on the beach while chatting and coming across others doing the same thing. The metaverse is scrolling through facebook while wearing your VR sunglasses as you're walking along. The metaverse is just going one step further than a mobile phone. It is about making tech a greater aspect of our lives through wearing glasses that make life a mix of reality and VR, such that you never actually need to take off the VR glasses. [These are the glasses that Facebook released recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkpFqbpa0Zk). They don't have any VR capability (yet), but you can see the kind of thing that ZUCC is thinking of having in 10 or so years. The point of the metaverse is to integrate facebook's software into our lives in such a way as to never actually come off it. With any social media currently, the second you put your phone away it's gone. With the metaverse, you'll be able to interface with social media just by having a pair of glasses on, making it much easier to stay online in perpetuity. The double-whammy that META have here is that they can use the hardware they're developing for the metaverse to host a facebook operating system, making them less beholden to the interests of companies that host their software and apps, such as Apple. It's all very dystopian imo and I hate the whole idea, but I think it will make a fuckton of money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:07:58'] Imagine instead of having to go to a physical store, ie wasting your time and money (gas, transit, etc.) When you can hop in the verse and browse the store of your choosing, fill up your cart, then just check out immediately, with the items shipped to your door or PO box or whatever. You might not like it, but generations younger than us will love it
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:01:38'] The concept of the metaverse or a virtual universe is inevitable, whether Meta is the company to propel it forward or not.The technical issues you mention, will be resolved in time, probably by augmented reality, with no more headsets down the road, just glasses.Imagine not needing to go into an office because you can have a face to face conversation in VR (or augmented reality).  Imagine not needing to go to a furniture store because you can see the furniture in your house with augmented reality.Imagine if you have an entirely different life on the metaverse.  Imagine instead of meeting someone in person to go on a date, you go on a date in virtual reality.  Now take away the current technological limitations, and fast forward a few decades (or less), and imagine that it's so close to real life that the difference is negligible.  The Oculus Quest 2 at that point will seem like the original NES in terms of quality.Imagine not needing to be rich because you could experience pretty much any luxury experience in a virtual environment.Your kids will no longer go to school in person.  Their classroom will be at home.Social Media will no longer be words, photos, and videos on a screen, but it will become real life.  We're already in an existence where 20-year-olds can make millions by posting youtube videos or instagram pranks.  The concept and boomer social construct of "work" will be an entirely different thing.Imagine a MMORPG (massively multiplayer online RPG), but it's in real life, with real money, where you can have an entirely viable existence outside of the current one you are in.Wild, right?

So we're going to build fantasy land where people can spend all their money?  What about real life?  It's a zero sum game.  We can build a Metaverse at the expense of our real world, but you can't do both.

Young people feel more at home on the online world than in real life. People work remotely and need connection. The price of everything is going up and the world is closing down, you ll only be able to see Russia in StreetView from now on. Avatars will be the new apps. Look at what people do in second life: they buy shit for their avatar all the time, it's a dress-up game, and that's what facebook 3d will be about. Few people will use VR devices, but 3d will be a natural evolution of people spending more and more time online.

I don‚Äôt remember if the 1% was from FCF or from revenue but either way, Mark Zuckerberg is dipping his toes in, and is not shoulders-deep in the water.Even without the metaverse, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp are strong enough on its own. The platform isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdying‚Äù as people still check their accounts, and the dedicated millennial-boomer users are always on Facebook. The younger generation prefers Instagram, and WhatsApp is one of the most used message apps ever. Through data mining your messages or history, Meta can cater ads to you, which is the main reason for earnings growth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:25:34'] Am I correct that there is no single metaverse, that there will be a bunch of different ones competing with each other? So to bet on just one of them at this early stage seems risky.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:26:47'] With a technology like driverless cars, everyone immediately gets it and assumes its just a matter of time.  With the Metaverse...well, most of the population isn't really chomping at the bit for its arrival...or even really understands what it is.  He's banking on the long game, which ends with him creating Ready Player One and Meta being the first and biggest.  Seems like a huge risk that's just as likely to flop, but when you're that fabulously wealthy its not like you're ever going to miss a meal if the dice you roll come up snake eyes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:38:44'] I see it, but it's a ways off. VR in its current incarnation has some special moments but a lot of downsides. But progress in the tech changes that ratio.For instance with current tech we have lifeless avatars that can't manage facial expressions. The hardware solution is difficult. But we could have AI predicted expressions that accurately convey our sentiment in the very near future. As for a billion, that's a low estimate if they get it right. Imagine a limitless world full of wonder, excitement, and connection. And then their are the AI applications. With everything tracked and stored, you could instantly visit with a VR copy of anyone. Imagine being able to see your dead spouse, a perfect recreation. It will have an AI curating everything you see. The best part is it will have a negligible carbon footprint and you can do it in a very small climate controlled room. When the world gets harder to live in, we will have this ready alternative.For this thought experiment you need to assume it will be more comfortable. That's a hurdle it will absolutely need to overcome. But once it's as comfortable as sitting in the non-VR room, with all the things there for you to see, why wouldn't you go? Have you imagined what a real VR movie experience will be like? To be in the room with the actors, see them from every angle, be part of the action. The beauty is that once some of the initial hardware problems get solved, AI based software solutions should do the rest. Honestly, I don't think it will be better. But I think it will happen, and it will be inescapable. So as an investment I get it. The world is sick, and this won't be the cure, but I could see it as a way to numb the pain. People will pay for that for sure.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:48:04'] Also what companies are going to be initially willing to invest the potential millions this would cost to outfit a large portion of their workforce to use the Metaverse  and move their communications to this new platform as early adopters? I guess that's a big part of the gamble, but can that much extra productivity really be wrung out of virtual reality meetings instead of  just renewing annual teams license subscriptions that they already have?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:55:44'] With the current technology we have right now it‚Äôs gimmicky.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:55:47'] So we already have all the necessary tech and infrastructure to make it happen. It really is up to the tech industry to ratify standards for how metaverses interoperate on that higher level. For example, something as simple as identity (web3) is a particularly popular solve for that, or 3D avatars which have no solid standard that companies can build on to make sure they display correctly across all sorts of experiences and engines.  I truly believe that it is more of a policy/agreed-upon-standards thats truly holding us back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 10:56:51'] what you're seeing/comparing is Metaverse (cartoony, fatigue, etc) in its very very early stages. It will take at least another 10 years of development before you can see what Metaverse will really be like.But with investments and time, the technology will be there sooner or later. Technology will continue to develop as it always has... to become more immersive and more life-like. Just compare the games of today vs the games of 20 years ago. In general, most ppl are not very good at imagining what the future will look like. metaverse is not a gimmick, its a future tech that WILL become widely adopted once the technology capabilities is there.Also, Meta isn't going all-in.Its allocating a portion of its free cash flow.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:06:37'] I‚Äôm not sure. My favorite activities in life are swimming, running through a forest, hanging out with friends at a bar or camp fire, playing basketball, and playing acoustic music with people in a room.I‚Äôm not sure the metaverse will ever take care of those things. They might get to a cool point, but overall, I think exercising/being mobile with a headset isn‚Äôt going to work out.I also get a decent bit of vertigo with the Oculus. I‚Äôm sure the tech will get better, but it does seem completely absurd to go all-in on it. I have zero interest in spending money on virtual clothing.I guess kids growing up in the digital age might have a different perspective, though it seems like most addictive/destructive things stray away from the most intelligent sector of the population.I can see cool educational applications for the metaverse, like running crazy dangerous science experiments, flight/machine training, surgery, etc. Is there great money in that? Not sure. I suppose if they could create a solid classroom environment, that would be a game-changer, so long the kid keeps its headset on. But otoh, Metaverse is a for-profit company, and I don‚Äôt think education and profit should directly mingle.I think the big thing is the internet became the internet because it was a non for profit open source platform for everyone to use. Facebook was the same. I can‚Äôt access the Metaverse without buying a VR headset (presumably Meta‚Äôs) and registering a valid account with them, including my CC#. I just don‚Äôt see how it will take off as the universal platform, unless it becomes very open source and free. The headset/hardware aspect of it makes it impossible, it my mind. I can run Windows OS on any computer hardware.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:10:55'] One AR/VR situation where it actually adds value is when you need someone to fix something that is far away. You basically scan the equipment and let him walk you through it - it is usually extremely important that it is 3d and that you can even "touch" parts and see where the problem is. Imagine having one person for whole EU or USA that can sit anywhere and still be able to perform maintenance of various equipment scattered across the country... just useful.  Regarding the META/metaverse, I agree with you. You get fatigued, it is not that much fun and we kinda know that it is a dead end - as you all remember 3d movies which are no longer being made, because it was just too lame.  So my best guess is to stay away from it as an investment, apart from the companies that deal with technical/maintenance simulations.

Now that the technology is here, and everyone could video call each other all they want, people don't even want to voice call each other. People text message.Sure, your boss or teacher may insist on you getting on Zoom, but really that's because they want to surveil you, it's not because people prefer video chat.Reddit (and much of the larger tech obsessed world) suffers from a logical fallacy that "any technology that can be imagined will eventually be realized, and that any technology that is realized will be mass adopted." Blockchain, VR, metaverse, etc... While those technologies will probably have niche uses and small communities of diehard fans, there is zero inevitability that they will ever get mass adoption.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:29:39'] I want nothing to do with this and I think while there are plenty of people keen on experiencing this its a little too far fetch of a concept that's going to blow up in their faces.1. Will anyone ever really be able to afford this ? Like most people on earth have a phone but are we going to have hundreds of millions of people able to pay for these vr sets and what ever extra incurring costs ? 2. People who can afford to go to exotic places or travel will just do it, why settle for some sub par or even end of the day above average visual experiencing when the real thing is well within their reach.3. We already know the damage of blue light and the destruction we are inducing looking at screens all day every day. Will people want to continue this ? Wil people be physically able to do this ? How long before we literally scortch our retina and brains?4. What about people who are concerned about privacy and data collection that is already rampant , will those people welcome another avenue for big tech to map every essence of our being to target more products we don't need ?It begs the question, is this one of the worst investments in human history?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:30:00'] When I worked at Magic Leap, the meta verse was more envisioned as additional content layers overlaid on the real world. So there could be an entertainment layer where you interacted with monsters while LARPing with your friends, and a transportation layer where you could get google maps overlaid on the real world. I can buy into this vision of a meta verse, it‚Äôs the delivery system I‚Äôm a big skeptic of. Goggles strapped to your face really seem a non-starter to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:34:42'] Just from the headline I'd say what you're touching on - because the Metaverse could, if successful, be something as disruptive and as world-changing as the internet was. Chances are it won't get there, but chances are it will. And if it does, it's gonna start a new era. Personally, I believe it will develop, on the B2B side at least. As for the Metaverse Zuck is envisioning, that's gonna be a whole bit more difficult. That said, the possibilities if it succeeds are boundless, and eventually everyone will have their part in it, just like the internet. There will obviously be places to buy and sell, there will obviously be the gaming side. There will be porn. There's eventually gonna be stuff like virtual vacations even. Ever wanted to explore Iran but either didn't have the money or were afraid of terrorism? Well, if the Metaverse as Zuck envisions it comes to be, you will be able to. And all of these are very superficial things. It really could span a range from "nich√© and mainly B2B" (which I am very confident will develop at least) to "literally a second life that everyone spends hours upon hours per day on".
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:46:23'] Right now, it's a solution without a problem.  Of course we're going to keep advancing the tech and someday it will be ubiquitous.  The problem with Meta, though, is I think they are too early.  It will take years or even decades for the tech and infrastructure to advance and for people to come up with the new 'killer apps' for it.  The other problem for Meta, at least as I see it, is nobody can really 'own' the metaverse.  There will be a lot of challenges for them to navigate to get there and also to stay there.  I would not invest in the 'metaverse' at this time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 11:46:46'] I completely agree with you. I don't see VR advancing a significant degree in the next 5 years really, and it's certainly not worth investing in its current form.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:09:58'] Imo it's the idea of virtual reality. For any reason if people want to escape their reality, they current have choices such as drugs, alcohol, other substance abuse or other entertainment options like TV or games, some go fishing, camping, traveling to escape. Imagine if you can achieve all of that in virtual reality, sure the current form of VR is far far away from that but I think that's the ultimate goal, if it will be legal lol. Examples of the danger of this can be seen in the Matrix or Inception movies, but with enough lobbying money in the US it probably will be legal to some degree.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:37:19'] Geez My comment is # 410 lol.The way meta wants to do it is very ambitious and imo will fail. I like apples version where it‚Äôs using its existing augmented reality apps to leverage them onto their AR glasses and grow from there. Seeing how it might work best and organically growing. The meta version is more like a holodeck in Star Trek. Gamers are the first ones to understand how it could become huge. You‚Äôll interact w others and be in that virtual space for many hours. It can be gaming. It can be education. Health. Therapy. Love. Fun. Social. Business. For sci-fi nuts like me , it‚Äôs very obvious the amazing opportunities it can have at every level of life. From having a boring corporate meeting on a nice beach with your boss on the other side of the world, to teaching kids history with interactive movie with a teacher infront. Meta versi√≥n going all In is definitely a bad move imo. They are turning into yahoo where it has tons of apps and side biz that no one knows and fail. Hardware wise also. The idea is no bad per se, it‚Äôs just fb doesn‚Äôt have the best track record for many things they are trying to do. They could be focusing on other things like a Shopify competitor, making fb watch a standalone biz to compete vs YouTube. Have a free email service and other ways to harvest more customer data outside apples privacy wall. But mark seeks to have been playing too much video games and want to do that full inmersive metaverse. And gave us a cartoon world in his keynote. So I think either Apple or some random company will do better. Like when zoom became the pandemic sensation on a tech we all clearly thought the big faang should have had.It‚Äôs plus it‚Äôs obvious meta wants to become the platform for it and charge people. Peope who distrust meta a lot. Metaverse in general = great oportunityFacebooks metaverse = big fail
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:39:12'] We‚Äôre not wired as humans to interact in a 2d plane which is where the internet resides. VR will allow individuals to experience the internet but in a 3x environment. This means business meetings, sporting/music events, gaming, shopping, and of course porn since it‚Äôs the internet.Imagine instead of typing this exact message out to strangers you can throw on a headset and step into a world of like minded individuals. With the internet we can be closer to niche communities than ever before. Curious if you will enjoy a trip to the city or a new hotel? Throw on your goggles and take a walk around or virtual your. Curious what you would look like in a new dress? Goggles and you‚Äôre in the store. It‚Äôs literally endless. 10 years ago I bet you would call me a liar if I described a modern phone or graphics card capability. Stop thinking of meta as a new item entirely and just realize it as the next evolution of the internet. My only concern is with how early fb is arriving S others have pointed out. They are burning through cash to set up the infrastructure required to operate in this universe. That coupled with the fact that Zuck is 38 year old who‚Äôs best idea originated from stealing someone else‚Äôs plan. It could fail in the short term (3-7 years) but in the mid-long term (7-20) it seems like AR/VR will dominate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:39:38'] I agree but to be fair it‚Äôs not just Zuck that‚Äôs spending a lot on this
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:43:01'] my opinion on this, with no research beyond what i remember from current events news at the time, is that everything "meta" related is merely a forced rebranding of FB in an attempt to avoid bad press. If you recall, right before they became meta, FB was getting raked over the coals in the press for data security, enabling all kinds of bad shit, being bad for mental health, ignoring internal content guidelines, letting big names get free passes on content, etc. There was talk about anti trust investigations. Suddenly that all vanished, right after they rebranded and got people to talk about something else. Flushing a couple billion a year down the drain on an eternal development project that is actually just advertising is a really good ROI that helped them side step much bigger problems.  I expect anything they make out of this to be about as fun as a mandatory HR training video.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:44:09'] The technology currently exists for haptic feedback when interacting with digital objects. It's janky as fuck at the moment, but it exists and can be improved upon:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyHT0t-mtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyHT0t-mtw)Companies are already using what amounts to metaverse technology for remote training:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ehSCWoaOqQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ehSCWoaOqQ)  14:26 time indexPut these together and you get a properly interactable environment. Surgeons could do practice runs on rare operations before cutting on a person (or the medical school could simulate unexpected complications). In addition, training people to perform  other jobs where the price of errors is high becomes much easier if you can put them into  a digital environment.Ultimately, metaverse technology should be able to allow  a person to do anything you've seen done in the holodeck in Star Trek (or seen implied off screen, if you catch my drift) with sufficient technological development.  The pieces and parts are all there to do what needs to be done but they're not developed enough to do it well yet.What Meta is looking to do is get in on the ground floor so that everything that comes later is built on their tech. They want to create the X86 architecture or the Steam of interactive VR so that their platform is the go-to down the road when it happens.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 12:54:21'] Being able to own something that you could never afford in the real world for a fraction of the price.The ‚Äúmeta verse‚Äù doesn‚Äôt belong to anyone, the fact that Facebook has just taken ownership of it is just insane to me.  It‚Äôs being developed non-organically and I feel like in the long run it‚Äôs really going to hurt it‚Äôs adoption.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-23 13:03:58'] >I've used VR headsets many many times and have owned one of my own...one of my biggest issues is that you get fatigued with that headset on your face pretty fast. It puts weight on your face, it makes you too warm, and my eyes get fatigued staring at that screen for an extended period of time.  &#x200B;All of these problems are a direct result of how young the tech is. All of these problems are being actively worked on and will disappear in less than a decade as long as money keeps flowing into the technology.Fatigue is a result of the weight, the low resolution, and the visual-vestibular dissonance.Weight is getting lower, resolution is getting higher, FOV is getting bigger, screen door effect is disappearing. Nausea and vertigo might be controlled with vestibular stimulation, but even if that doesn't become mainstream, it only really applies to games (Where you move around a lot but your body doesn't). That means sure, gaming might not be a thing you do for a full day at a time, but social apps and virtual office spaces might become something that's as easy to stay in as a real physical space, when all other problems are solved.&#x200B;>Furthermore, with a video chat, you see the actual person, not just some animated cartoony looking version of them. With a video chat, you see a person's subtle facial expressions, whereas the metaverse characters only pick up body movements and I don't see how they'd ever get to the point where they can pick up on every little facial expression that an actual video can pick up.&#x200B;Again, this is a lack of vision. People who try VRchat don't sing praises about Omegle. People who try Horizons work environments prefer it over video calls. Sure, they might complain about the sweat and heat and weight and resolution, but those are all problems that will be solved relatively quickly. The next generation Meta headsets will  capture your facial expressions with fidelity comparable to that of an NPC animation in a video game. Full realistic face scans will be next (and this will happen in this decade, the only limiting factor here is the processing power of the device or the streaming bandwidth)&#x200B;>I do think the metaverse can produce some really fun gaming opportunities, although I still feel they're a bit gimmicky. I have noticed that Mark Zuckerberg seems to focus primarily on the business application of the metaverse. I just don't understand how the metaverse can convince any significant number of businesses to buy metaverse equipment and get into the whole metaverse, when we already have video chat capabilities.The equipment is cheaper than renting an office, it's cheaper than paying people to commute. It's cheaper than flying people from different countries for in-person meetings (there are vital parts of the work that can't be done via Zoom but can be done with accurate 3D scans of offices and products).Startups right now look for talent all over the world. VR allows people to work in a shared space without the office expenses, the commute expenses, etc etc. This will be embraced by startups. Initially VR-focused startups, but eventually others looking to expand without increasing costs significantly.  >I believe Zuckerberg is a smart guy, but I don't understand how going ALL IN on the metaverse can possibly be a good idea. Obviously there are other players in the metaverse space (not just Meta/Facebook), but Meta seems to the the furthest along and they're pouring billings of dollars into this. The thing is, I think the traditional Facebook businesses are a solid investment. Their "Reels" are growing very rapidly. 50% of the time people spend on facebook is on videos...a lot of that is Reels. 20% of time on Instagram is on Reels. They're fighting back well against Tiktok. But the fact that they've changed their name to Meta and they're going all in on the Metaverse makes it impossible for me to invest.I don't know if Meta will be the ones to get to a VR future. Maybe. He's trying to fund his experimental business by attaching it to a profitable but fickle social media business. Social media popularity wanes with its social generations. New 18 year-olds aren't jumping on facebook, they need a social media where their parents aren't, and they're also the people who are going to spend the most disposable income in the next decade. There's a high risk that Zuckerberg won't be able to just buy the next big social media, and he probably knows it, which is why he's going a step further hunting the thing future kids will want to be in.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 07:30:56'] I bought so many shares on the dip. This report was absolutely expected and it's not about gaming, it's about crypto. They sold way less GPU for the gaming market because these unused GPU that served the crypto mining business were re-sold on secondary markets to gamers.Once the crypto crisis end (which btw was caused by the FED hiking rates so it won't last much longer), there is gonna be a huge increase in GPU demand. This is all temporary, nothing wrong at all with Nvidia business which is extremely strong and they are at the forefront of the AI revolution. Moreover with inflation at almost 10% the real stock price of Nvidia (in last year term) is 10% less than it's quoted today...so if it's 180$ now it's equal to roughly 162$/share last year.This is a company that I'll never sell for 10 years. One of my highest conviction picks along with Google, AMD and Palo Alto Networks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 08:12:42'] Tbh I'm surprised how well NVDA has held up. These headwinds were kind of obvious and even after this drop the stock is still trading at a very high valuation.NVDA sold off over 50% in 2018 during QT and the "crypto hangover". As a casual observer the macro for NVDA seems worse this time, but even after this recent drop NVDA has only gotten back to peak 2018 multiples. Back then it bottomed out with a PE in the low 20s, today it's trading with a 50 PE.I get why people like the stock and I've owned it a number of times over the last few years, but I can't bring myself to buy it at the moment. I might be wrong, but I still think there's a good chance this stock will be trading in the low $100s at some point over the next 12 months.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 11:07:07'] If you believe that renewable sources of energy are the future, then you need to also be thinking about who will best be able to monetize that energy. Energy has always been easy to produce, but difficult to monetize. First it must be created, then it must be transported to where it's needed, then it must be sold to consumers who want to pay the lowest possible price for it.So, who do you think will be best equipped to monetize the production and sale of renewable energy? I think it will be the same companies who have been monetizing the production and sale of fossil fuel based energy. The company that is making the biggest investments in renewable energy right now is Chevron. They are my long term bet... And Buffet's too.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 23:42:35'] Something in AR/VR, which will be potentially bought by Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon or Microsoft, since they are all investing in that area.Many are giving Meta a hard time about the Metaverse, but I encourage anyone to try a Meta Quest Pro to see where potential lies. Their mixed reality is very impressive for productivity and should be further improved over time with software updates and better hardware.Mixed Reality is easy to see everywhere, from classrooms and medical facilities to assist in complex task or training, to the next big thing after the smartphone as a consumer product in the form of glasses or automotive windshield technology (this could be any company from 3M, Corning, Nvidia, to Google, Meta, etc; it's very difficult to call with what information we have at the moment).I think to understand what might be "next", we need to think what might be wild, futuristic, highly likeable and helpful, and creatable.Perhaps even one of "The Big Five" (Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft), will grow even more rapidly than we can imagine at the moment.

If FED is raising rates, the market will have a hard time going up. If FED is cutting, the market will act irrational.At your age, you should think in decades. Buy slowly as market goes down. You will end up with lower average cost per share and then just hold long term as long as the company is doing well. If something major happens with the company than review why you bought and make adjustments.Just my opinion, but AMD is a bit less risky. INTC is going though some major changes. If it works they will be a great company to hold. I like the new CEO but I am not sure if the rest of the company has changed enough yet. Best of luck.

They have Batman.Intel - Chips, new factories, ceo that climbs on Kilimanjaro.Palantir - Psycho ceo, Cathie Wood sold her share. This is my speculation, either it fails or will be huge.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 05:57:19'] Energy. It‚Äôs in a long term secular bull market. This dip is due to triple withching in June. The period between now & the end of June is the best time to buy energy stocks this Summer before the next leg up.Edit: This is not a recommendation that anyone else buy energy, tho. To be long in energy right now means being willing to read news every day and keep up with your stocks daily on account of all the turbulent geopolitical factors. Most retail investors don‚Äôt do that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 05:31:43'] I think WBD is very cheap. Down about 50% since the spin off. Streaming is very crowded, so obviously it‚Äôs risky. I do think they have the best catalog besides Disney. Tbh, Disney is probably also a buy, but I‚Äôm not as familiar with it.

Incredibly risky I know, but I‚Äôm trying to get to the point where I can sell TQQQ and UPRO covered calls to fund my DCAs. Then once things rebound sell far OTM calls until I either get assigned or am satisfied with profits. Or I I just lose it all.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 06:26:53'] Save your money. Build up a sizeable emergency fund. If that is is done, then stay on the sidelines as prices are only going to keep going down. We're in for quite the storm, and you'll wish you hadn't wasted money buying stocks at these prices when youll get a much bigger discount later this year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 06:59:15'] $SPY personally.  Back in 2020 when it dropped ridiculously low I put in about $4000 into $SPY ETF and I‚Äôm still in.  I‚Äôve been adding to my position since then.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 07:00:20'] How likely is it that the Fed will actually hike rates by 100 points?I think it‚Äôs more than what people think since not only inflation hasn‚Äôt peaked, it‚Äôs going up faster than ever. So I‚Äôd consider 100 points and 75 equally likely.50 would be unlikely since it seems it didn‚Äôt do the trick.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 08:56:08'] So since we just went through (or still going through) dot.com bubble 2.0, I'm not expecting a lot of these tech stocks that were ridiculously overvalued to ever make it back to their previous highs. Some might but most will likely just rise to non overvalued levels.I'm throwing my money at SPY/QQQ. These will go back up, it's just a matter of when.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 09:07:43'] my $TWI has been on a solid, constant uptrend. i'd highly encourage anyone out there to read their last few quarterly conference call transcripts. short reads, but paints an extremely bullish picture. totally insanely undervalued in my opinion. the TL;DR is that they've had quarter after quarter after quarter of their biggest growth in like a decade with very little sign of letting up. revenues for this year alone are about 2x the market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 09:08:49'] $SCHD is nice. Maybe $SPY leaps
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 09:14:05'] Agree. In the Fall it was time to buy energy, now it's the time for tech. I opened a credit spread on Confluent (CFLT). Buy 1 $17.50c  Sell 1 $20.00c  Sell 2 $10.00p  exp 10/21/22The above should make up to 13% (41% annualized) with 46% cushion ($9.96 breakeven) through 10/21/2022.
