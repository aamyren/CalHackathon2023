POST_TEXT: b"Apple reached today a new all time high of $182.7 in pre-market. Lots of expectations around the WWDC event and their much anticipated VR announcement.\n\nWhat's your personal take on this? Is it just euphoria or is Apple poised to grow even further throughout the rest of the year?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 05:55:11'] Apple is a company I cannot value correctly so I simply leave it as its share in ETFs and no more.Initially, the company seems significantly overvalued. But then I see people taking on 60 month loans to buy the iPhone 13 Pro.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 07:27:58'] It’s funny cause most people own apple if they have a 401k.* If you are invested in the SP500 apple is 7-8% (Spy, Voo)* Total US stock fund apple is 6-7% (VTI)* Total World Stock fund apple is 3-4% (VT)So it’s safe to assume we’re all holding.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:07:54'] Apple is hard to value. In my head, I just feel like they are overvalued, but they’ve proven time and time again to always be consistently innovating to keep up with tech. I likely won’t be selling and just will continue to hold to see where this goes. I gave up valuing Apple back in 2019 and have been holding since.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:52:21'] Sell now and buy back in higher
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:35:55'] AAPL remains a solid investment, but I have no interest in trying to predict the behavior of it's price over such short terms as the rest of the year. Too many factors that influence price. Long term I expect it will continue to perform extremely well though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:55:42'] Someone should aggregate all of the "Should I buy Apple here?" posts from the past few years and all the comments saying the market cap is way too high to grow any further.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:51:35'] I bought AAPL at $47 and am seriously considering entering again this morning at $183.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:09:54'] I listened to the bears saying they'd buy Apple maybe at 120 or 110. I listened to all the noise about Apple's earnings tanking was the last ingredient for this bear market. Everyone who has bet against Apple since Jan 2022 has been wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 05:11:36'] Bought puts at 160

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 07:28:20'] I've been buying APPL for 5 years and will continue to buy it for the next 50 years. Anyone calling this stock overvalued is galaxy braining themselves.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 07:49:11'] aapl is the stock equivalent of a savings account these days.I own some shares but haven't bought more in a few years from the low mid 100s. rest is now in mutual funds and index.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:27:05'] I actually am convinced by the headset. I might buy my first individual pick, I think it has the same potential as the iPhone did back in 2008
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 07:29:38'] AAPL has done well for me - however PE seems to be getting up there.  That said - we are headed to a bull market, would you bet apple doesn’t participate?  I bet it does, but will also write some calls against it for some additional income.  I will also not be upset if they get called away because it has had a tremendous run.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:42:01'] Apple is a singular, amazing company. Stock trended sideways for two years. It is due for a jump!

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:41:32'] mega bullish on aapl.  not only do they have so much potential products and services they could come out with (car, AI siri, AR/VR, etc.) but besides new products, they have so many other tricks up their sleeve to keep the stock going up. they take that fudiciary duty seriously :)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:25:55'] Buy apple when S and P drops down or around 3800
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:23:23'] This aged well….
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:00:01'] If the stock bump has anything to do with the headset announcement, we're going to see a lot of unhappy people in a few hours. It is pretty much common knowledge at this point that the initial run of headsets will be $3,000 and geared toward developers. Apple have stated that their goal is for AR to replace iPhone in 10 years, but we're probably years away from an affordable AR solution from them (note I said solution, not headset. I remain 100% certain that AR/VR will never be viable as a mass-market product as long as the form factor is a headset)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:11:12'] I'm skeptical that VR/AR will have anything close to mass adoption. Meta did their best and failed. The cost isn't reasonable for the novel experience, especially as Americans are cutting back on discretionary spending and looking to prepare for the recession/depression.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 07:16:30'] Besides airpods, I'm not a fan of apple products but man i gotta admit they're killing the stock market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:56:59'] AR is really risky and unknown - im more interested in other things like the potential for glucose monitoring- if they can get that right it would take them to the next level.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:01:09'] It's forced to go up since it has such a large weight in the market index. Earning could be flat for the next 5 years and this still would be pumped. It's easy to keep the market green when this goes up. The same "narrative" about fundamentals could easily justify a 140-150 pps, but since this is the most bullish market ever we are where we are.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:47:14'] Almost 50% of BRK A/B is apple. Buffett must think it’s the way. The next biggest holding is less than 10% (BAC).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 08:34:27'] Buy and hold Apple for 10 years. There will be no regrets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 09:04:01'] Unrelated to value but gonna throw this out there cause everyone’s edging over the whole VR thing: I think if a company can make it cool it’s Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 20:00:59'] The VR headset is going to be an underwhelming product release.Sales for Meta’s headsets did incredibly well during COVID while everyone was cooped up and then sales dropped once people could go out and live their lives; I don’t see headsets as a good investment opportunity.In the end this wont matter due to Apple’s incredibly loyal fanbase, still a great stock to hold; I view it as a tech stock that can smooth out the returns of other tech shares one would hold in their portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 23:58:32'] Apple has a lot of cash and are generating more. However, the new VR goggles will not be big sellers, they are too expensive.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:14:04'] Honestly, that headset is worse than Google Glass.    I don't expect it to sell well.I can't see anyone in business with it, and teens will get laughed at for wearing it around.We'll see a surge of thefts of it.   Too easy to knock off a kid's head and steal it, so that's a no go.    It'll be a device that sits at home with nothing on it.   I highly doubt it'll hit mass market with how ugly  it is and with how obvious it is you're wearing it.Maybe it'll be cool to use for a while.   I just don't see it.Then again we all laughed when the iPad came out...   It did initially sell very well but has since tapered off a lot.    Only use these days is to play Netflix for your kids in the car on road trips.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 09:58:41'] Yeah, I can’t with this stock. I just stay away. There are other companies that I can buy to outperform that make me feel significantly more comfortable.

Yet the economic situation and consumer spending today is obviously worse than 2021. \n\nWhat do yall think about $AAPL at $175 today? Is there more room for $AAPL to grow or is it time to trim down some positions?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 10:26:51'] I don't own Apple but they've created an entire tech stack that farms money from their customers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 10:43:45'] I bought a hundred shares of AAPL. That evening I told my mother, an experienced investor, and she was horrified. ‘Oh, I don’t know, Apple has gone up so much the last year or two! I’m not sure it can keep going!’The year was 2004. Happily I decided to ignore mom and stick with Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 09:39:53'] Apple is one of those companies you just hold until you really need the money. No one can predict what will happen in the next few years. What we do know is Apple is going to continue raking in insane profit and people love their products.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 10:56:05'] I don’t know but I would certainly not bet against what is arguably the stock markets favorite pick in the last 5-10 years. Remember you don’t have to come out with innovative ground breaking products. You can improve on existing ones, expand on services,or just flat out produce products people want that are perceived as high quality.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 13:48:20'] Apples main growth will come from their services segment. Thats my opinion. They have a billions of devices in billions of peoples hands. They can rake in a lot of money from monetization from that. We are already seeing that in their earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 07:35:27'] I have about 5 shares of Apple. We all started somewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 11:54:51'] Apple needs another AirPods/iPad like product to jump start growth.Luckily, they've heavily rumored to be on the cusp of announcing an AR/VR product - like the iPhone and iPad, it'll probably be bulky and expensive for the 1st gen but then have a more streamlined and price-friendly 2nd gen.But even if they don't, it's not as if Apple will disappear - they'll likely continue to grow, just not astronomically as in the past.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 12:58:16'] I don't see a longer term for them yet need to see new products and I hope they are working on siri AI
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 10:21:11'] APPL is the richest company in the world.  It spends more on one quarter's stock buyback than the marketcap of the 50th largest US company.  It can get into almost any business it wants and dominate the industry $-wise.Its upside is essentially unlimited as long as capitalism exists because the rich get richer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 11:46:42'] whatever reasons people have being being short apple long term has been echoed since like the iphone 6
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 06:33:20'] Oh most definitely.  Apple is the best positioned to grow - they have minuscule market share in most of the world.  They'll hit $3T market cap at around $190/share (probably in the next couple months).  Look for them to be the first company to $4T market cap, around $254/share, depending on the pace of buybacks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 11:23:01'] AAPL is 85% of my portfolio. I worked for them for 5 years and got a huge discount on the stock. I continue to buy even today because they’re managed so well and people absolutely need their phones and MacBooks. If the AR goggles are what we think they’ll be - I don’t see how the stock doesn’t double by 2025.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 09:35:41'] AAPL $300 by 2024. It'll double because even if revenue is down for an entire year straight, Mr. Buffett loves it and we know he has the ear of Wall Street & Regulators. Ignore the whole "reliant on TSMC Taiwan" thing

Sell cc I guess and roll them up or down up to you.Let's be honest apple isn't a growth stock.  They want to treat it as one of course while claiming it's blue chip as well.You are or not a little pregnant not both.But since markets remain irrational longer than shorts can remain solvent don't bother shorting but could take some profit on selling cc or call credit spreads in case something stupid like hyper inflation happensSame thing with all the fang stonks.Treated like blue chip and growth when they ain't growing much

My philosophy is I rather invest in a company that make high quality with good profit and not make it up on high volume with low GP.   This too will sort itself out, but thoroughly impressed with transparency glass and use of their chip and sound tech.What I also like was the consistent usage of "Machine Learning",  not the AI hype.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 16:52:52'] $3500 is all I need to know to know it won't be a widely bought product.If you need another reason, I'd say that you don't want to interact with a person who won't take off their giant headset in the same way they won't put down their phone for you. I actually think the idea of non-isolation is a good one, but people still want to feel like it's just you and them when you are conversing so spending so much time and effort on that aspect, when it will never be enough, is rather pointless.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:38:39'] For what it's worth, the eyes aren't visible.  It's got a screen on front that redisplays your eyes, (or likely, an AI-assisted model of your eyes), and fakes eye contact with eye tracking.  The screen changes to cloudy colors when the user "immerses" themselves in another world, (like watching a movie, or sitting on a mountaintop.

I imagine their 3500 headset is likely impressive AF compared to anything, and will be used at high level design particularly with corporate accounts, and people who can afford it. If you think apples first real launch in a decade is bad news then idk what to tell you. The only bad news would be bad reviews once released. But given their budget along with timeline of patience and perfection because they have that luxury, I don’t imagine it’ll be bad.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 21:41:48'] https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/12/history-apple-stock-increases.aspAAPL historically sells off on most reports, be it fiscal or product announcements, and then—surprise surprise, rises in the subsequent months.Why?  Well for one, there’s the constant buy-back dollars that Apple is putting to work.Ok, what else?  Any trader that wants a guaranteed return will play AAPL as it’s been played for decades. They almost always under-promise and over deliver on their fiscal results outside of black swan events despite annual FUD tales of supply chain woes or poor planning / estimates—despite multiple pundits singing Apple’s unmatched skill at keeping their supply chain insanely healthy and diversified (outside of Covid—though Apple did much better than others).So yeah… nothing new to see here.  Headset is gonna ship. It’s going to sell however it sells.People will figure out what they want to do with it, and what it sucks at currently.Apple will iterate and if necessary make other choices if the AppleID’s say so.  Until then, focus on everything else was just released, as a gap in the Mac product lineup has been filled, and there’s a constant stream of tweaks and fixes that keep AppleID’s happy and using their devices.India is now unlocked and it’s the next major population target of growth and recurring Apple purchases. New phones for parents, previous phones handed down to children, locking in future generations to an Ecosystem that knows no limits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:02:46'] Wasn't sure the point of the announcement after seeing the price. Microsoft Hololens has been this price for 7+ years, and they aren't any close to a consumer product yet. Maybe that's one reason for the stock drop?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 02:32:46'] >The OS is called Vision ProThe OS is called visionOS> Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).No developer is going to want to buy this if the market share is low and consumers are not buying it. You don't need to buy the device to develop an app for it either. It's still 6months+ from being available to purchase too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 04:18:48'] If you look at what Meta is publicly revealing in their research lab, you'll see a mountain of AR research and devices. What's interesting is that they have yet to mass produce an AR-specific device, despite what they already have.  The Q Pro seems like it was meant to introduce the idea, while not throwing all their eggs in one basket.I think Meta is playing the long game on this one, and sees Apple as jumping the gun too early. Honestly I think Meta knows a lot more about this than Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 10:06:07'] Even at a $0 *growth* trajectory Apple has such a strong cash and balance sheet that hanging around these levels will naturally raise their stock value by buybacks and stock returns.There would have to be a full 20-30% market drop from these levels to take Apple down, partly because the S&P is is 7.25% Apple, lol.

But seriously, Apple and Microsoft make up 15% of S&P. I believe last time the index was this concentrated was in the 70s with IBM and AT&T. You see what happened to them.

New platform due to debut this summer, go on sale fall’23/spring’24, and then they’ll iterate until they cannibalize it themselves.As China’s middle class prices itself out of cheap labor, Apple has diversified their contractor’s factories into emergent markets, eliminating some /all of the import taxes headwinds for new / existing consumers in those markets.  India is the next big one, and Apple has just barely scratched that itch.Existing and future AppleID’s will continue to buy new and replacement hardware, adding services here and their from first and third parties of which Apple will always get some slice of it somehow.  Until there’s massive government regulation that overhauls *EVERY* platform owner.Apple is getting deeper into automotive and live sports programming, banking, personal identification, …what haven’t they gotten into?

But one can always try to speculate, so here goes.If the us defaults(hardly a likely or even possible scenario), aapl will probably go below 150, possibly even below 120 or so. But it’ll bounce back no matter what.Otherwise, if we get a bigger banking crisis which for whatever reason can’t be averted by the fed, Jpm, etc, they might drop as well.If you mean dropping due to actual devaluation of the company itself(and not macro factors), I just don’t see it happening any time soon, possibly ever.

The amount of sheep that buy into their products with little understanding that they are LEGITIMATELY being scammed blows my mind. I could list for hours all the cons and small scams that apple pulls on each of their devices but thats not what this sub is for. Why apples successful? People purely love apple for its aesthetic, "celebrity status" and easy to use OS, which masks the list of issues in its design and limited lifetime use. If only the cost actually reflected what you got.The swing to android has slowly started to increase as their phones continue to prove valuable and durable.Imo, and this is not financial advice. Ride the apple stock train but watch for the social clues to know when to jump. Proven by pictures, meetings and documents of hedgefunds, Apple talks quite often with big hedgefunds (such as citadel). Theres now way they would let Apple tank.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 19:12:07'] Don't put AAPL... Have you not learn anything in the last few big tech earnings? They have set insanely low expectations, so their earnings are guaranteed to be a beat. And stock price will rise after the report.AAPL EPS consensus this earning is a YoY decline, how do you think AAPL cannot beat this expectation? It is a guarantee beat just like the rest of the big tech. Get some call too to hedge
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 08:48:00'] Regardless of what I've ever thought about AAPL, they just go up. The stock is a gold mine.I bought 145 calls in 2016 and held to like 180 then converted it all to shares pre-split. Bought in again post split at 113

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 11:58:33'] $AAPL current p/e = 28.81. $AMZN current p/e = 133.93. Even though I am a current bear and believe we are overdue for a market wide correction; apple has more room to run relative to other over valued tech companies if you think the market will continue to rip.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 12:28:51'] > I bought a handful of AAPL puts yesterday for 5/12 $165 strikeWhy would you do that? Did you look at the daily/hourly charts? AAPL is in an up trend, there isn't a reason to go short (though I do agree I see it an overbought signal on the CCI). Overbought is one signal, you have to factor more than one signal into your decisions.Going short wasn't the move, it's a gamble if anything. With earnings at play you may get lucky, but at -20% you should close out because a positive earnings response coupled with theta decay will give you a two-punch KO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 08:04:52'] I think AAPL will go up heading into earnings. I bought 5 of the 172.50 calls expiring 5/5. They're up around 20% as of Friday's close.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 10:54:46'] It's typically easier to make money on the long side, just statistically. Second you have all of these other hints going on like the market is more than 10% off the all-time high. People are ultra bearish in the media but you don't really see it on the charts in relation to events. Intel for example, not the best earnings report, stock goes up. I'm sure there are people shorting this but it's really dangerous when you have that happen. You have to ask yourself with apple is business getting better or worse? From what I can tell they continue to grow. The final thing you have to keep in mind is some ridiculous number like 90% of options expire worthless. If the stock goes up you lose, if the stock doesn't do anything you lose, if the stock doesn't go down enough you lose
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 11:11:11'] Well, a few weeks ago there was some news that their hardware deliveries declined by 50%. So based on this alone I expect they will announce they beat on some metrics, but also they miss on other metrics. Stock will move in after trading hours higher, and then it will go down. Similar how the Amazon stock behaved.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 11:19:56'] They are, by market cap, now the largest bank in the world. 4.2 interest and nobody is racing to beat them.

Why wouldn't I?I am not an apple pay guy, but I bet I will be pretty quickly.I suspect by next quarter, the amount of outflows from traditional banks and inflows to apple is going to be bat-shit crazy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 15:05:36'] when buying a put, is there a rhyme or reason? do you just feel a particular outcome in your heart? I always ponder if special insight is needed to know which to go with.

There are better things to short outside of the top company in the world.It's really just Andy Jassy and team at Amazon that don't have a feel of what they need to do on the call to help the stock lol (in Big Tech). Now granted they may have been too truthful there and said some things that aren't great macro fundamental wise overall.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 08:37:13'] I wouldn't bet against Apple. I'm sure they got a lot of deposits with the new savings accounts.  Not to mention probably did well across all other businesses.

He says he's stuck in the apple ecosystem but he's not paying the current prices for new iphones. He will continue to wait it out until there's a good sale or he will be a used old model. Based on this anecdotal evidence it could up, down or sideways. I have no position on this company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 11:58:31'] I have no opinion on the stock’s direction. It’s overpriced and has developed a cult following. The company continues to perform amazingly and continues expanding its ecosystem but as an investment for the next while, I don’t think it’s a good idea. Despite this, I think you’re gonna be back next week to eat your hat because those puts might expire worthless. I am never going to be on the stock and I am never going to bet against it either. The stock moves illogically.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 13:17:03'] It's going to beat earnings, give weak guidance and end flat or down. That's the status quo this earnings season.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 13:30:13'] It’s an interesting play into earnings for sure. People are saying both AAPL and UBER should have good earnings. Longer term AAPL is a no brainer because they hold so much cash. When credit crunch hits end of this year, cash will be king for valuation. Short term it’s overbought, but it always moves 3-4% regardless on earnings it seems.

They saw Microsoft and Meta have a 3 day greengasm, I imagine they are throwing together an ER that will not disappoint l. INTC has shown us you can have the worst earnings report in your companies history by a large margin, and because they said AI, the stock did quite well in the run up to earnings and post earnings. AAPL is going to crush it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 14:13:48'] They had their worst quarter last quarter, and the stock is up 17% since. Insiders also sold $40M of stock since March. And everyone in this thread is bullish on it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 14:45:29'] One thing that I have come to realize about the world, is that sometimes, regardless of what the market says or the economy reflects. If the people are behind a product then it can not fail. Even if you offered most iphone users a flagship android and cash on top, none of them would take the offer to switch. Apple cannot die until something comes along to replace them and that product is no where to be seen.&#x200B;Source: im just some idiot on reddit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 15:04:19'] Buy Apple when it goes down and hold. Right now it’s high in my book I am up 125%. So I am selling some. It will go higher but PC sales will lag the stock in the market. When I buy I see a stock normally go down 10% but don’t sell.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 15:24:08'] I actually kinda like this trade and suggested it recently in another thread, but that's assuming you're trying to hedge downside market risk, not as a near-term speculative trade.My thesis would be that if the market goes up, AAPL will probably go up less due to its valuation and recent run, and if the market goes down AAPL will probably go down with some extra beta from current levels.But again, this would be put on as a hedge to derisk a portfolio long S&P500. It sounds like you're just speculating on the AAPL's earnings with options which isn't very smart honestly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 17:04:01'] The problem is that even if phone sales slow or even decline, apple is becoming larger software, though its only gone from 17% of revenue in 2019 to 20% in 2022, its CAGR during this time was 20% and that means organic growth, excluding iPhones user growth would likely be around 5% annually. I mean Apple pay transaction volume is at 650B, half of PayPal and roughly the same as Zelle. Along with this, they just started HYSA partnership with Goldman Sachs, if they charge GS a 1% fee of the interest rate of 4.15%, thats 275M in revenue which is extremely high margin. I mean PayPal, lower growth is valued at 85B, so with Apple Pay growth prospects it alone is probably worth 50B.I mean this is their best example but it just shows how they can just supercharge product development in services and if they lose in certain products, atleast they take a cut of competitors revenue lol. I think overtime they are going to become a better version of the Microsoft model of providing a platform with any enterprise product that may be a little lower quality than alternatives, but are integrated into the Microsoft platform so are just easier to use, though I think Apple being apple to take a cut of competitors enhances this type of model among other aspects.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 17:06:09'] Their most recent earnings estimate from Zacks was revised lower recently, and their historical options flow from the last week is bearish as well.With that being said, if we've learned anything from AMZN it's that EPS and revenue doesn't matter as much as what they say on the call which is hard to gauge in advance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-29 17:36:44'] I think what might help them out is that iPhone purchases intended for the holidays were pushed into Q1. I learned my lesson with Microsoft not to wait for the stock to drop after earnings to buy it. Also, if they have bad earnings, people will swoop in and buy the stock anyways. So, whether they have bad or good earnings, it will most likely increase, is my best guess.It could go either way or sideways, though.

Operating income at 22.7B.M3 and A17 chip yields are 50% on 3 nanometer. M3 yields will increase 5% per quarter. We will have some delays on product launches, also Dev teams shifted to working on the new OS.  M2 chip products are undersold and they stopped m2 production for 2 months to reduce over supply. M3 product launches will be constrained and delayed.Prices will increase this fall to make up for shortage in sales.I see sales are down and future sales need to be dropped due to production issues with m3/a17.

AAPL never seems to meaningfully pull back outside of the consequence of market pressures.As overpriced as AAPL is stock is compared to their book value, I think it's incredibly well managed. I would not consider shorting unless there were big changes in their c-suite.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 22:34:35'] My portfolio is also very top heavy with Apple, result of buying shares in 2013 and 2014 that are up like 450%. I’m not selling, fundamentals look good, ROIC is great, and I believe they’ll continue to grow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:14:20'] Don’t do it. The gains you will likely see from those two stocks in 10, 15, 20 or more years will probably be much greater than any given fund could ever produce. Neither Apple or Microsoft are going out of business any time soon. I think I read some article that said that every $1000 invested in Apple just 20 years ago would be worth over $600k now. While I don’t know if these same gains will be true for the future, I suspect both Apple and Microsoft will continue to outperform most funds. I could be wrong, but I wouldn’t sell. I’m actually trying to fix some past mistakes- my late father gave me a small portfolio many years ago, heavily invested in funds. If he had put the same money into Apple and Microsoft, I would have no financial worries today. The funds actually hold quite a bit of those two stocks, but the growth has paled in comparison. I only buy stocks now.

POST_TEXT: b'APPLE seems to be riding pretty high these days. yesterday I happened to watch the $ BRK.B  Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders meeting. \n\nWarren Buffett even made the comment that Apple stock performance was better than any company that  Berkshire owned. \n\nThat is why he is so high on Apple.  With apples buy back and the increase in dividends, I see APPLE hitting probably $200 before the end of 2023. Does anybody agree?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:47:29'] AAPL will definitely go up this quarter, unless it goes down, in which case it will go down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:17:36'] There aren’t a whole lot of companies trading at all time highs right now. Judging on the comments here you can look at it two ways. One is you own the best company in the entire stock market. The other is that if you buy today there’s not much room for growth. I tend to think that buying good companies is rarely something you regret, and it isn’t priced stratospherically high either. As far as addressing that Buffett bought at share prices less than 140 dollars amd isn’t buying at todays prices, it’s because apple is nearly half of Berkshires portfolio. How much more could he buy without being dangerously lopsided as far as diversification?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:10:05'] When you say BRK.B loves AAPL... They only have 1 buy above 160.  Only 3 above 140.  The other 97% of AAPL was bought far far below.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:58:11'] I expect the elite blue chips like AAPL to trade flat until the storm clouds clear, then start making new ATHs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 16:44:59'] Not to be downer but there are a ton of reasons to believe Apple is going to underperform over the next few years. A stock follows its company's earnings over the long term, or rather a constant state of expected earnings growth, of which Apple is truly lackluster. Top and bottom line growth projection are awful (single digit) when compared with the other megacap names like GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA yet AAPL is still substantially more expensive than its historical average.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 07:04:01'] Everyone is focusing on the financial or market results of Apple but no one is looking at the Apple products, which I think are becoming crappier, much like after the first time Steve Jobs left Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 15:14:27'] I have been seeing YouTubers, Redditors, and CNBC bring on a bunch of “experts” talking about this upcoming earnings. You would think with all this talk about it if Apple misses it would mean the end of the entire market. People are going crazy about it right now and this is my opinion.Apple has always had periods of booms and busts. One year would be really great and the next meh. It has always been like this. The last 2 years have been phenomenal for them so it wouldn’t surprise me at all if we see a slowdown in electronic sales. Right now computer sales have had a big decline across the world. We see this in the Microsoft earnings. Microsoft did really bad in their computers and general hardware in their recent earnings. With all this will it surprise me that Apple misses? No. Will it be the heat death of the universe if they do? No. Will it surprise me if Apple beats either? No. Apple has always had a history of beating peoples expectations and it would not surprise me if hardware sales do not decline as much as Microsoft’s due to the strength that the Apple ecosystem has shown in the past.Apple has also been moving more towards subscriptions and financial services. Very high margins and so far has been growing every single quarter. This can probably also soften the blow if there is a decline in the hardware side of their business. The way I look at it is whatever happens happens. If we see a beat I am ok with it. If we see a decline I am also ok with it. I can see it going both ways however I want to lean more towards a miss. Apple is currently approaching all time highs and I would love to see the stock pull back some so I can add to my current position.

I just bought more shares in case the price jumps after earnings. I figure I can add more if it goes on sale, but at least I have the minimum number of desired shares now.

You would think the company that makes the OS would be able to make it stable on their own hardware that they designed. Nope. Utter garbage. Not that their OS is great either, it's just so embedded in enterprise software that companies have no choice but to use it. Once everything goes browser based SaaS, their OS sales are going to tank as well, which isn't a bad thing for them exactly as they had enough foresight to embrace cloud services. MS cloud based services are pretty much the best around for enterprise but they are going to lack the staying power since migrating to other platforms won't be as much of a challenge as it is now.Apple continues to not give 2 shits about enterprise and focuses solely on the consumer market... but then again, as things move towards browser based applications it might not matter as much.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 03:37:20'] I think content creation is really there to add value to their products. Netflix has 31.6bn revenue and Apple has 394.3bn revenue.Chasing the competitive streaming dollars is such a poor use of cash. But driving more product sales and bringing people into the Apple ecosystem is far more profitable.Netflix would rather sell $1000 devices every 2 years than collecting $7 per month that can be shared by multiple people and cancelled anytime.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 10:21:46'] Whats funny is 1 billion dollars is nothing to a company like Apple. Thats like pocket change for them. If they can invest this successfully and grow their Apple TV subscription base this can be a massive win for them. I heard they got some good content on there too but I think the main issue is there is not a lot compared to other streaming platforms. This could help fix that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 05:43:01'] This is the way. All steaming platforms should adopt this model, just makes sense. Have your big movies get a huge pop in theaters, let word of mouth spread the hype to the losers who think they are too cool to go see a movie in theaters and you will gain users organically. Apple TV has a small, but GREAT library of original content. They just need to general public to discover it

POST_TEXT: b"Apple's recent financial performance and position in the AI industry have raised some red flags. Despite generating significant revenue, Apple's gross margin percentage has seen a decline, and its heavy spending on share buybacks might suggest a lack of better investment opportunities.  \nAdditionally, while Apple has been investing in AI, they seem to be falling behind. Their acquisitions in the field haven't yet translated into significant progress, which may suggest difficulties in integrating these acquisitions or a lack of strategic focus.  \nIt's crucial for us to keep a critical eye on these developments. What are your thoughts"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:10:35'] Apple is a big boat and very slow to course correct. But when they do, they rarely chase and instead typically navigate the boat to where they believe a product / market is going to be, or where they think a product / market should be.E.g. burning CDs… eh, they missed that market, let’s just sell a device where you never have to swap a CD, ever again, and get in on what goes onto that device. Thus iTunes and the iPod.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 12:08:04'] Long, and I mean long, time Apple fan boy and I share your concerns. I’ve been using ChatGPT professionally for a few months now and it has been life changing. About on par with the iPhone, the Web and PCs before that. It really feels like they (and Google and Amazon) bet on the wrong horse with their AI types. Though, to be fair to them and the rest of the world, almost no one knew LLM would be this useful and Siri/Alexa/GA have a different role to fill (practical, narrow field).As a shareholder, I’m not sure WWDC is going to bring us what we need, but as a fan I’m really curious about what their solution to VR/AR(?) is going to be. But I’m pretty sure it’s not going to be as much of an “of course!” feeling as the iPhone was.

In 2019 (before Covid) its 52 week low was $37. I understand that Apple has seen a significant amount of growth in the past two years but I don’t believe we’ve seen the bottom in it yet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 15:18:28'] Is it really or are you just parroting talking heads from the past.  What truly is innovative coming from the likes of AAPL to justify the high multiple?  It’s still a 22.17 P/E but does it really deserve a P/E over 16?  With manufacturing moving away from China we’re going to see compressed profit margins in 2023-2024 along with weakening consumer demand.A/R isn’t going to be as popular as the iPhone and I think the market is over estimating possible innovations that might end up being duds or products that fail to launch.There’s still plenty of downward movement especially after the Dec sales figures are released.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 16:13:11'] If you’re holding for 10 years, sure, good time to buy. But with their current difficulties in China and the interest rate rises I would be a bit wary. I think this upcoming earnings should show the difficulty they are facing. The chart also looks like it’s been undergoing distribution since beginning of the year.

Anyway, I've got half a position at about 135. Will happily buy more if it gets to 120 - between inflation and growth, don't see it going back to 80.See the thing about Apple - it's a cult. And it sells its (overpriced) products to the 500 million richest people in the world. And once in, most never come out of its walled garden. There's a reason 40% of BRK is AAPL.

If you've already owned it and averaging the cost, it doesn't matter the 52-week low is a good entry point or not. You may have bought more earlier and would buy more if it goes down further. If you haven't already owned, wait. The market will go lower.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 16:15:10'] Not aapl, but I am hanging on to what I got. Also, these tech stocks are just getting HAMMERED. I am moving out of some of my recession plays to a few techs. I think there is some opportunity coming up here. I bought Amazon today, but boy... META is trading like funeral home. They definitely have some headwinds, but damn. For Amazon, they are getting into healthcare, which might be huge. There is a possibility they spin shit off. I think there is a possibility that there is some C level good stuff that could happen and spike the shares. So, good bye Popeye's Chicken and hello Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 16:17:57'] I’ll buy more when it’s at its pre-COVID high.  52-week low is pretty meaningless with the amount of stimulus and how far prices went up over the past year and a half.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 16:20:36'] Sad thing is most large stocks that the big boys own and large etf’s own are down close to 52 week lows as well. There isn’t a safe stock outside gas and defense stocks but that rug pull is coming soon too

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 16:51:38'] Of all tech stocks, apple is by far the safest. This is a company that refuses to fail, is a market titan, and is looking at diversifying and expanding the company. 2023 will be horse shit for just about every company, but if you’re buying and holding I think apple is about as safe as you can get….

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 17:30:24'] It was the few high marketcap stock that held out really well this year - too bad it was also finally taken down
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 17:35:07'] Apple will probably go down a lot more before it goes back up. The Fed is still increasing rates and sucking money from the market. It is still the largest market cap company and a prime candidate for instructions to rotate out of as they need liquidity.We are not out of the woods yet with respect to the Fed and Apple will probably continue to decline until midway through 2023 or later when the Fed pivots.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 17:37:46'] It’s a good entry point but she’s going further down in 2023 as we enter the recession. Stockpile money and wait for the recession, stocks willl be going to pre-pandemic prices. Will pick up apple at sub $80

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 19:43:22'] I remember in 2016 when it was trading at a P/E of less than 10.  There were concerns regarding the sustainability of its earnings and cashflow.And now, everybody and their uncle believes it's the creme de la creme of stocks.Perception can alter drastically, and betting on the largest market cap company has performed woefully historically.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 19:45:34'] with all these tech stocks down 25-60%, without guessing which one to buy, would it not be better to just play it safe and get a etf or fund that groups them all together to take the guessing game out of the equation?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 02:44:06'] Being at a 52-week low means it's held up really well comparatively. Lots of stocks right now are near 3 year lows, lots of others like Disney near 7-8 year lows. Many stocks that IPO'd over the last couple years have been setting lower and lower all-time lows every day this week. Whether it makes sense to invest in anything right now hinges entirely on if inflation finally capitulates. When it does we'll be in for a fed u-turn and massive green in the market. Until then, there could still be massive amounts of pain in the market. If this doesn't come for another 6 months, you may start to see a wave of bankruptcies.

Also if there was a company that could threaten their position it would have to be from a company thats sort of trailing them right now (samsung goog etc)? its impossible for some genius working in their garage right tinkering to come up with something that would replace the smartphone. Even if some dude did come up with such a product, guess what? he would be bought out by APPL/other tech companies before it gets dangerous. thats what silicon valley is all about. we live in a tech/internet/cloud dominated world now. where pretty much almost every successful business relies on the cloud infrastructure. overtime the cloud only becomes bigger. buy pretty much any FAANG (not netflix) right now and its impossible for your portfolio not to be green in 10 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:25:22'] With Apple's cult like following and the fact that they're continuing to expand into new areas, I think it is one of the few big name stocks that nobody could go wrong in owning even at this price
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 20:32:29'] I don't like Apple for a few reasons.1- they just came in 10th place in a camera shoot out released by mkbhd on YouTube2-they are not releasing a Mac Pro3-they put a stop order on iPhone manufacturing because of low demand4-they are being forced by the European Commission to install USB c and a removable battery this will affect their laptop ports and accessories market, it will also allow longer term iPhone management5-they have been instructed to allow off appStore installs, which means less revenue6-they are entering the electric car market, which is already hammering Tesla, as it turns out, electric cars weren't all they were cracked up to be, and humans are figuring out new ways to make greener fuels. There simply isn't enough lithium in the world, but we can make fuel from hydrogen, algae, sugar cane, etc.As the world gets poorer, i see way less demand for Apple products.I think they will shrink to $1.3T in the new year. That's a $700m kick in the balls.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 14:21:37'] True Amazon is lagging in terms of return %,, could be due to their hyper focus on growth. They truly have the widest MOAT with a hand in multiple industries. Balance sheet would look completely different if they chose not to purse (for example) Whole Foods, or cashier-less stores. However, their vision comes with risk and doesn't always pan out in the short term, but long term Amazon will far outlast a lot of its peers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 15:50:06'] Is it me or has Amazon been going down hill ever since Jeff stepped down as CEO?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 17:19:11'] Not unless you're in it for the long haul.  Amazon has been building infrastructure fast and furious.  Their growing pains are tremendous and with that are the costs.  There will come a time when they plateau, after that there should be better returns.  Right now they're trying to do too much too fast IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 13:31:22'] As we all know the past 6 months is all that matters in investing. It will definitely continue forever, and there’s definitely no value in longer time frames. This is foolproof.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 13:48:27'] Google will fall more, it's an ads business and we're heading towards a global recession. You people should start noticing how the companies make money and not just their P/E or how much they fell YTD.Nvidia will also fall more because of China sanctions, Ethereum switching to proof of stake and global recession ahead. The stock was crazy overvalued after the massive rally post Covid (which I have contributed and made lots of money, but I sold everything months ago).I don't see much upside from Apple, IMHO the stock will underperform the market in the next 5 years. It's a huge, mature company right now with limited growth potential.Microsoft is definitely the best one among those because of their cloud business, their Microsoft Office business (which is extremely resilient even in a recession because companies can't function without it) and their expansion into gaming with Activision Blizzard acquisition. They are also active (and expanding) in some professional software for data management which can net good money in the future. Of course Microsoft is also a huge, mature company but it has more room to grow than Apple. And it's safe even in a recession because their revenue are more recession proof compared to Google, Nvidia and even Apple (which sells to consumers for the most part).

Recession incoming, and electric vehicle sales growing quickly sure doesn’t help.  There will be an epic short opportunity in the near future on these inflated oil companies.  It wasn’t long ago funds wouldn’t touch them, and once demand starts to contract the reality is that these companies have stranded assets.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 06:01:48'] I am very surprised that Google is as profitable as it is.  If I where a major share holder I'd clean house because they clearly have a siloed culture.  That is, every team works on their own project without much feedback or communication between teams.  No real product road map to speak of.  Plus, many of these teams have "Not Invented Here" mentality which has lead to a serious duplication of work.  In the last decade they have launched nearly half a dozen operating systems.  Another example would be Google Stadia's, which ran on a Windows compatibility layer on Linux, did not use any Wine or Proton code what so ever.  The engineers justification for doing so was so they could learn how compatibility layers work.  Because they clearly do not have a road map, and siloed internally they lack a clear vision for the company.  Hopefully someone eventually comes in and makes these changes because while it may be profitable, it's clearly not run very well at all.

And there is 100% chance an Apple Car is coming in the not too distant future (not guaranteed to be a hit, but given its track record...)Yes.  Buy, hold, re-invest divvies, never sell.  IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 05:33:54'] My buys in AAPL are from 2012, 2013 & 2018.....it was valued at some 300B during the crash of late 2012 to 2013 and some 600B during the slump of Christmas 2018. I can't get myself to put new money into a 2+ trillion dollar market cap mega corp  with 400B+ in revenue that needs to keep growing double digits and maintain margin in this new interest rate regime where the risk free return of doing nothing with your cash is 5%. What growth multiples are expected from a tech company in both hardware and software services when the risk free return is 5% with higher rates and  international sales numbers are being  impacted by a stronger dollar?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 23:38:43'] Yes. I would set up a limit order / sell a cash covered put and keep a cursory eye on it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 20:27:36'] Last time I consider buying Apple was when it's PE was 10 in 2016, that's when Warren Buffett bought it. Boy I missed that one it seems so obvious at the time and I still didn't pull the trigger. Microsoft was also selling at a PE of 10. My point is really good buys come up every once in awhile that's when you got to pour the money in an individual stock otherwise buy the index.Individual stock buying should only occur when there's a obvious smashing little risk opportunity. Something that doesn't require any analysis or intrinsic price computation. Don't settle for anything less.Also when they do come don't get cold feet and talk yourself out of it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 21:17:23'] Apple is already a massive company. It will become more difficult for it to maintain a high growth rate. We are also heading into a recession. As the FED continues to fight inflation, there are more headwinds ahead for the market. AAPL can still go a lot lower. We could see an opportunity to buy Apple at a great discount before this expected economic crisis is over ( a lifetime opportunity).It depends on the type of return you want to make, if you want to make high ROI, then its good to wait and buy in the middle of the upcoming economic crisis. It seems impossible today, but considering where things are headed, we could eventually see Apple fall below $100. That's only a 30% drop. Enough bad news can make that happen. I would like to buy AAPL at something like $92 (a 33% drop). See my assumptions https://decodeinvesting.com/ticker/AAPL/valuation?growth_rate=15.0&current_eps=6.11&future_pe=30.0

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 06:43:17'] It is not appropriate to make investment decisions based solely on the price of a stock, as this does not take into account the company's financial health, industry conditions, and other factors that can impact the performance of the stock.It is important to do your own research and consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions. This may include reviewing the company's financial statements, understanding the company's business model and competitive landscape, and considering your own financial situation and risk tolerance. It is also important to diversify your portfolio and consider a range of investment options to mitigate risk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 11:39:50'] It's a no for me. Apple's book value per share (equity) has been falling the last several years which portends that their growth is about at its limit. The share price should, in a sane world, hold steady or trend with the general market for the foreseeable future. You can "trend with the market" in much less risky ways than buying apple stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 11:51:10'] I sold a put to buy at 130. Expecting to be exercised and probably not the bottom of the bell curve but around the bottom 1/4th.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 13:44:41'] No. Incredible company but given the size I don't see Apple being a growth company going forward. Also, I believe Covid caused a lot of artifical demand. We are also entering a recession which will put negatively effect consumer discretionary companies. I'd prefer to see a PE closer to 12-14x. I think Goog and Amzn are better values at the moment.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 14:48:43'] I don’t think it was a bad move. It’s trading at a historically high P/E relative to itself right now while it’s growth will slow because it’s so mature. I wouldn’t race to get back into it right this second. Let the dust settle from this rally it’s hard to believe there won’t be a pull back on it soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 13:12:18'] I bought Apple in 2011, and then sold in early 2012. Then I realized that was dumb, so I bought it again in late 2012 and DCA’d through 2013, and I still hold today. Point is, you can buy back in again, and you’ll probably be fine long term if you just keep holding. Don’t overthink it, AAPL is a war horse.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 14:29:18'] if you made money, that's great, you cannot top tick every trade.  the real question is, did you reinvest in something cheaper or going to compound better than AAPL

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 23:17:32'] I'm super bullish on Apple, but I believe with all the uncertainty over China's economy and political brinksmanship, there will be opportunities to buy at lower price again in the future.Also I think it's 50/50 chance that Apple car will be a flop. So far all the news I hear about that project hasn't been good. I think if some big negative news come out it's going to kill the stock short term as well.However, in the long term I'm very bullish on their integration of cloud, ai, iot, and medical use for wearable devices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 12:56:15'] Their moat is their cash. They appear quite willing to spend whatever it takes on buybacks to give themselves a hard price floor. That seems to be a major difference that many miss when analyzing them. For most other companies, buybacks have to end eventually as a strategy to prop up a stock price, or more accurately, have a hard limit due to lack of liquid capital. As long as they’re willing to deploy the cash that way, they can create their own pricing floor at will.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 15:01:31'] You made a good move dude... There's a lot of muppets here who will insist you should continue to own stocks at any price, which I don't agree with at all. It's good to take profits when a stock you own gets a bit too pricey, then you can put that money into stuff you feel more comfortable holding. Holding a portfolio of companies you feel are overvalued because of some "buy and hold forever" philosophy to investing seems kind of silly to me. Imo if you don't care about fundamentals, you're not investing you're just hoping that line keeps goes up.Anyway, why don't you take that profit and put it into something similar like GOOG, MSFT or VOO? It's only a bad move if AAPL outperforms significantly from here which I agree seems unlikely for all the reasons you state.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 13:43:04'] Profit is profit. I have also sold AAPL before to trim down the position size. Put your profits into an index fund to be more diversified and don’t look back.

Here’s some perspective, I felt like I had the best stock when Apple hit 180, with all the talk, hype, the news of the cap they were about to hit, it just seemed to me like it was going to keep climbing like a powerhouse. Then when it fell back down, I felt like an idiot for not taking the gains while I was staring them in the face. Just recently closed position at 170, and while it’s not 180, it’s back up to where I was regretting not taking profits in the first place. All it took was a little time. Now I’m just happily waiting for a chance to open another position with Apple. Cheers man
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 18:54:03'] I bought AAPL back in the 90s after I can afford to buy my own computer (the translucent Power Mac G3) after Steve returned to Apple. Had always held and never sold.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-28 12:29:05'] Hey man it’s only been ten days since this post and it looks like you accidentally sold at a good time lol. Just buy back in
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 13:44:34'] Apple is just such a great ecosystem. I’ve never met a single person in my life who switched to Apple and decided to switch back; maybe they exist on the Internet.Every Apple customer is a customer for life.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 12:59:31'] Learn from your mistakes and don't sell good companies. Apple has a good competitive advantage over its competitors. Yes it is overvalued now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 16:47:56'] Apple is literally the biggest company on earth. What returns are you expecting from that long term?Seems like a good thing to sell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 13:06:43'] meh - you'll get a chance to buy it back. Just sell puts at your buy price and you'll be all good
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 13:11:56'] Don't sweat it. If you've been holding it for years, then you must have made out pretty well. Apple isn't Tesla - it's not volatile and isn't going to double in price anytime soon. So you can always get back in there if your interpretation of the fundamentals supports it. Personally, I would just sink my profits into SPY and forget about them. Anyway, at this point, I think the market is more likely to head back down than go up much further, so don't be too hard on yourself. And don't underestimate the amount of this current run that is being propelled by retail traders who may not fully grasp market dynamics and, IMO, the not-so-great trajectory of the world economy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 14:51:19'] I think you made an amazing decision personally. Your thesis is sound, the market is insanely irrational atm. You ALSO secured a premium on the sale, which is also cool.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 15:15:32'] I wouldve done the same
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 15:57:53'] You are just early bro. If you want Apple back I am confident the price will come back down to give you the opportunity to buy back in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 16:43:37'] I think it was a good sell.  I sold too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 18:17:24'] Nah, it's stupidly overpriced by all metrics. Also, market has been due for a bit of a pullback and you may get an opportunity to get it decently discounted - today had a very distinctly bearish tone

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 14:59:58'] Selling AAPL into this recent strength was probably the right call. You will feel better when you pick up the same shares at $110 next month.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 13:49:31'] You know what, not everything is binary.  You could have sold half, for example and remained in the name.  Played your hunch but not went all in with it.  The problem with building large positions is you have (hopefully) over time large built in gains.  You still have the company specific risk if you hold it.  If you sell it, you lose a quarter or more of your gains to taxes.Bottom line with your sale, remember no one ever went broke taking gains.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 14:47:46'] I have 2 CCs for apple at $155 for sept 16. I’m now pissed if I loose them. I’ve held and it held apple for years. If a financial tool to make money. If you didn’t want to loose them, don’t sell CCs on them. You also have the option to close and roll out to a further date if you want to keep them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 15:00:45'] I sold some APPL last month. Hated to do it, but I’d made money on it and tech is trading sideways rn. But I had too many positions to manage, esp in a volatile market and I’m consolidating. Prime target is AMD under $100. I need 50 more shares to complete an optionable block of 100. I want to do this with my whole portfolio. I’ll re-enter APPL later. Right now everything is at or near discount prices, it doesn’t hurt to consolidate winners into new opportunities, or even dump losers that are going to take years to recover. Last year’s trades are over. Take last year’s gains, cut last year’s loses, feel sentimental for a moment, then position yourself for a better run when the market recovers.  Congrats on the good choices thus far. Keep on investing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 16:45:52'] I thought about selling some during this run. I hold way too much AAPL since 2007 and I do think it will go sideways until they release the new glasses at which time I expect it to run to 200. The main issue is the tax hit. I’ll end up with a 6 figure tax if I sell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 16:46:39'] Not a big deal. I have no idea why it has the "hold forever" reputation attached to it. Its not like its been around a very long time. Also it is not as well diversified as a MSFT.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 17:44:56'] Do what you thinks best OP. Personally, I cashed out on all my American shares (I’m not American) due to the instability that has been brewing over the last few years, both financially and politically. I think it’s not a matter of IF there will be a recession, but rather WHEN will there be a recession. But that’s just my monkey brained opinion
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 17:54:36'] People who buy iphones don't make wise financial decisions. Recession or not they're going to keep buying the new phone, even when the new one is essentially a carbon copy of the previous one.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 17:58:30'] Back during covid I bought an ETF with 3x leverage at the absolute bottom. Bought TNA at 10.92 a share, had 768 of them, I was only a senior in high school so this was a crazy trade for me. It shot up rapidly, and within two months it was at 36 and change. Sold it for a good profit but had I held until November of 2020, the shares would have been worth 140 plus. Felt like such a dumbass, I’ve moved on, but occasionally kick myself. It takes time to get over it just accept you made money so it was a good trade, you never know what the markets will do so if you make money you are better than most!

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 18:22:11'] I mean, I would sell it since apple has seemed out of ideas for 4 years now, but not because you expect a recession next year.Their best idea has been M2 cpu setup whichis great on power consumption but doesn't live up to the PC comparisons they were making. The CPU is powerful on a mobile front, but not on a desktop front. Which means apples claims were smoke and mirrors again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 18:25:29'] You held for years, so you made money.What makes you think it's going to continue to go up?Personally I think we're due for a correction and AAPL will be part of it.I agree with the others.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 18:25:48'] But the resistance is at $178. It’s only about $174 now. Would it be smart to set a sell limit at $178 and take profits?

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 19:35:38'] Not dumb. It's rather expensive.  Selling expensive things and repurposing the dollars into good value things usually works well.Buying Microsoft in the year 2000 led to a 13 year rate of return of 0% because the stock corrected back to reality then took a long time to recover.The 22 year rate of return is similar to what you could have achieved buyifb a 22 year US Treasury BOND at the time.If you bought Cisco or Intel in early 2000, despite massive growth from both businesses themselves, shareholders are still underwater today. Why? Because you paid too much in early 2000. Don't pay too much. Sell to someone who will.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 19:40:00'] No matter what you decide when you make longterm predictions the worst thing you can do is second guess and switch course. Sure AAPL is a cash cow… but I wouldn’t say it’s out of the realm of possibility that things get worse before they get better. I sold about half my portfolio recently but did personally hang onto AAPL as even if a crash hits it’s safe to assume AAPL will be one of the first to recover. But either way there is no way anyone should feel confident in guaranteed gains in this current climate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 19:41:54'] Similar here, but I used the money from my shares being called away as a way to diversify more. Also I do think we will see another dip to 150s before we get above $200.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 19:46:53'] Set a target you will be happy paying for it and get back in. Do you know how much money they are about to make with a CAR?!??!? The accessories alone is going to put this into absurd territory. A good way people look at companies: Where can this company continue to grow? How can they continue to push profits to a new level? Apple just hired a major EV engineer. That’s one that *we know about*. The Apple car is coming. So are new charging docks, AirPods, airpod chargers, upgraded dashboards with integrated charging options, $8K heated seats, Colombian drug lord skin seats, all that. I sold my small position before the Googles earnings two weeks ago. Thankfully I didn’t lose out on much. Starting to DCA back in tomorrow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 19:53:02'] Aapl is expensive and I only own it through my Tech and S&P 500 ETFs. I own enough of it for the high valuation it has. The stock used to trade 15-18 throughout the 2010-2018 period.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 19:54:05'] It's why in general whenever something like that happens (and I would never sell Apple but if I did) - what I do is leave just a little bit in there.So in the off-chance I'm wrong and the stock skyrockets, you can still celebrate.I do this often with earnings reports where I'm very nervous about XYZ stock. I'll leave just a little in there before selling so I can still celebrate if I'm wrong. So whether the stock does well or poorly I feel good about it. If it does poorly then I knew I made the right decision. If it does well, I can still celebrate with the little guy still left.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 02:30:06'] Try using an Android phone for a year (or more if you aren't convince) and you'll know why iphone is the better phone. Android has the tendency to become laggier as time progress for no reason. My wife, relatives and I can testify to this as I witness them using it. Durability wise iphone will outlast the Android. You can easily use iphone for years without issues until Apple stop supporting it. Many craze Apple fans help support the company too by upgrading every year. These are the rich kids. Also Apple Macs and laptops are blazing fast too. I only heard great stuffs from people using them. I personally have not but is already impress by having the iPad 8th gen and iphone 13 alone.You have to stand in the feet of the users and not just analyze it from a company's financial perspective. The same can be said with Tesla stock. Understand Tesla car users and then you'll understand the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 02:45:32'] So you sold because “it felt like it has run up too much”. I think that you made the mistake of trying to time the top which is only possible on hindsight. The market will wipe its ass with your “feelings” unless you’ve got decades of market experience you won’t be able to go by what you feel you have to do some work.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-18 06:45:36'] Take this as a lesson that you are not smart enough to outsmart the market. Citing that 2% revenue growth is looking at Apple in a vacuum. They have had quarters where growth was very low and then it accelerates in later quarters. Apple is not a stock you sell so long as the company is executing as it is. I think most people on Reddit who are proclaiming that Apple is overvalued and they are selling will regret that a year from now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 06:33:24'] The thing with AAPL is they have so much cash they can buy any relevant company out if they want to and integrate it into their closed ecosystem. I can see P/E shrink in the next few years but longer than that it's a good dca stock.I would buy and DCA below if it hits 19 p/e, 131ish, it really all depends on how long Powell will hold the projected 4.6% fed fund rate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 13:24:36'] I’ve owned AAPL since right before the release of the iPhone. I knew the iPhone would be a big deal but never imagined it growing into what it has. When looking at the market share of the iPhone, I believe it’s around 56% in the US, it’s only going to grow over time because the iPhone market share for teenagers is extremely high at like 88%.I believe their AR/VR goggles will be a big deal as well and they are coming soon (all signs point to next year). They won’t be a big deal at first and it will take a few years to gain mass adoption but the technology will catch on, same thing happened with the watch and the airpods. Long-term, I love AAPL and believe strongly in it, short-term I think we’re in for rough seas until inflation is under control

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 14:06:42'] OP here: I see some posts here that seem to indicate that AAPL has to fall along with the broader market. Why should that be the case always? I see that AAPL is one of the most well run companies around. They make premium products and sell to the “masses”. My 2012 iPad still works fine. iPhone 6 is still working fine though Apple recently classified that as a vintage product. They have built a terrific ecosystem of software develops and accessories makers across the globe. I work is tech and I have not used anything other than Mac since 2009. And that is likely the case in many big tech companies outside Microsoft. Me and many I know are so entrenched in the Apple ecosystem with our iPhones , iPads, Apple Watches, macs, Appletv and apps that getting out is nearly impossible.  What am I missing?On another note: I have not bought Apple stock since 2013. All my investments in the last few years have been broad market ETFs. VTI/VUG/VIG/VTV.Also, I’m an active buyer. I only buy blue chip stocks that I believe I can hold for the next decade peacefully. I did trade some speculative stocks and lost. (PYPL, BABA, PLTR mainly). I decided that I’m a better investor and a horrible trader.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 15:16:07'] People have been saying Apple is too big for significant growth for a long time. They say it doesn't innovate, that it's overpriced. Every year, Apple stock crushes the performance of their portfolios. Apple is a great company, and very shareholder-friendly. It has been expensive for a long time as a result. I think being somewhat overweight Apple is perfectly fine. No one knows if it will continue to outperform the broader market, but I wouldn't want to be against it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 14:46:35'] Let me put it to you this way. AAPL is currently 5.5% of the total US market cap.Would you bet that in 10 years time it will still be 5.5% of total market cap or higher? If not, you are better off just buying the entire market for that hold period.I would not make a bet that AAPL will be anywhere close to 5.5% of the total market cap in 10 years. And if it isn’t, by definition, the total market will have outperformed it in that period.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 07:05:39'] It has a market cap of 2.25 trillion. It’s a massive company and growth will be harder and harder over time. As a stock, I think it will be a laggard over the next decade, and I certainly don’t understand why retail investors with so many companies to choose from want to pick the largest company in the S&P 500. Why not look for a lesser known business with far easier growth ahead of it?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 03:36:27'] Never sell AAPL!They have an incredible moat, teenagers overwhelmingly want iPhones and most Apple users become more invested in the ecosystem over time.I see no reason to sell if you’re holding it for the long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 07:05:57'] I'm not buying it at today's prices, but I also wouldn't sell it.Right now, I think there are better deals throughout the market, including its mega-tech peers (MSFT/GOOG). AAPL definitely hasn't sold off like it probably could.However, you could sell a small chunk just to diversify? VTI is already 5% AAPL as it is.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 07:37:49'] I think AAPL is badly overpriced and has quite a ways to fall. 110 minimum and maybe as low as 90 before this bear market is over is my view. But, you do have a sizable capital gain so selling may not be in your best interest. Can’t help you without knowing the details. You need to math this out based on your view of fair value and your tax burden.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 08:19:29'] Apple isn’t just a phone manufacturer they’re a technology company. In 20 years Apple will probably be the leader in a market that doesn’t even exist today. Computers > phones > cars > ???
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 13:01:17'] A great company doesn't mean it makes a great stock investment.  If you want safety buy a 30 year treasury bond at 3.5%.  If you want something that trades with the market just buy an index fund.  If yiu want to buy a growth company look elsewhere than Apple.    Over the next decade it doesn't seem likely that we will see a lot of growth from Apple especially compared to an sp500 index fund or other growth stocks with much better prospects for future growth.    Thr issue is Apple is already so big it is going to be tough to grow at the same rates in the future as the past.  Do yiu really think apple will grow at the same rate in the next decade as the last decade?  If an apple car ever comes to market there will be time in the future to purchase stock.    Other mega cap stocks with better growth prospects has to be Microsoft and Amazon with their cloud products.  Demand for cloud solutions don't seem to be slowing down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 17:02:07'] I’m also very heavy AAPL in my taxable account. Last year I was selling covered calls and ultimately was forced to sell 200 shares at $155 and had to take a tax hit. When the stock continued up to $175 I felt silly, but ultimately I used some of the proceeds to fund tax sheltered accounts.Unfortunately, I can’t give you a prediction on whether or not AAPL will out-perform the market going forward, but you may have an opportunity in the down market to diversify if that is important to you. Maybe there is a downside here I’m not thinking of, but if you have losses on other stocks you can harvest them while selling equivalent shares of AAPL at a profit that will break even for tax purposes. Just be careful if you DRIP that you understand that there may be some wash sale implications as a dividend reinvestment within 30 days counts as a “purchase.”

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 18:06:44'] They stopped innovating a while ago. Their valuation is also fairly high even during this nasty bear market which doesn’t make any sense. You’d think its P/E ratio would be lower. Interestingly, TSLA’s PEG ratio is lower than AAPL...
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 04:57:54'] Next year will be the usb c iPhone and I suspect a bunch of people will upgrade on that one.Also having followed Apple over the last two years it has a floor at 140 a share. I personaly always buy apple when it's user 150 a share and while I am currently in the red it's a relatively small amount. Everything else I own is down much more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 05:00:48'] AAPL in the long term is probably one of my favorite stocks. Their move to content distribution and vehicle automation is going to put them on top for another decade. The iPhone 14 was a flop so earnings will most likely be off with a slowing consumer market. I think we are approaching bottom next week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 15:17:13'] Man I don’t get it. They don’t innovate anymore and just sell the same shitty products over and over. One with blue text message bubbles and the other is computers that can’t play videya games

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 13:11:30'] If apple or MS don’t come out with new groundbreaking technology they will slowly fade to mid tier companies over the years. Just look at the changes in each decade. Something else will create a new market cycle and a few new companies will be at the top for 10-15 years. That said, times are different so with the cash hoard they have its hard to say that they don’t create that new technology themselves.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 15:28:12'] I sold my Apple shares at a slight loss yesterday.My thinking goes two ways. 1. If this recession really goes deep by this time next year, what we’ve yet to see is large cap S&P companies really badly miss on earnings. A whisper of a fart about iPhone sales slowing has them down 15% in a month. How much of a correction is coming when they badly miss on earnings expectations after people don’t get iPads and new iPhones this holiday season? 2. For my portfolio, personally, I am mainly an index investor. I buy VTI and VXUS in my Roth, and mutual fund equivalents in my other retirement accounts. If Apple falls, it tends to already bring down the rest of my holdings. I’m divesting to move to other things in my individual stock account. I’m absolutely a bull about that company in general though. I think they’re so diverse in revenue streams and will probably always have some areas that are explosively growing like wearables(the watch and headphones). If I weren’t so focused on buying the whole index I would be buying every dip.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 00:04:53'] Apple VR/AR headsets will take the stock to new highs. Data from AR/VR headsets will be the catalyst for fine tuning the Autonomous Apple car. Apple can lease the software to any car equipped with Apple CarPlay &/or if the stars align, Apple can produce its own car by partnering with an established car manufacturer (leaked to possibly be KIA/Hyundai). We already know they expect to release the VR headset at the end of this year or early next year 2023. I suspect glasses will be a year from now & they have already said their goal is for the  FULLY autonomous car in 2025. Apple typically overdelivers so I’m in it for the long run. There’s a reason the king of supply chains has maintained it’s high valuation IMHO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 06:40:13'] I wouldn't buy AAPL at this price. They're already more than 5% of the entire US stock market, which is ridiculous.And I (and the majority of the globe) use and prefer Android phones. Apple makes quality hardware, but they've been lagging behind on phone innovation and features for 5+ years. It's momentum and iMessage that grabs the teens, not an evaluation of features and value for the money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 17:00:11'] I think AAPL is a fantastic pick long term. Amzn and AAPL are the only two tech stocks I would consider buying. Amzn is a tougher pick because their PE ratio is terrible, but AMZN as a company is fantastic.Google can't innovate anymore. They've become bloated with rest and vesters and have a flawed incentive system for employee compensation which causes projects to get killed prematurely.Microsoft is slowly dying. They've underpaid their SWEs while hiring more and more incompetent PMs. They haven't shipped a decent product since the bill gates era. The only keeping them afloat is their moat and their sales team.Meta ..I.. just no.Netflix has maxed out its user base and can't really grow anymore. They're also losing users due to lack of content.Amzn and AAPL make the best products. Not only does AAPL make superior products, but they have mastered the art of American capitalism. "You want a charger with that? We'll.sell it to you for another $20"Amazon is absolutely dominating the cloud space and is slowly building up their moat as well. I suppose their online shopping platform.doesnt have much of a moat but their online shopping is so damn good.Anyways yes. AAPL good. AMZN too.

So Apple could try to make a pivot like Google did (seems to be going okay but not spectacular). However, that’s years and considerable investment away. Not saying they couldn’t, but for right now they seem to be totally fine letting you buy office for Mac, etc.You are of course correct that legacy assets like Bing/Windows are in scope and still represent considerable revenues for MS. But I don’t think investors invest in MS because of that. At least I hope they don’t.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 08:10:40'] Counter point. Global PC sales declined yet Mac grew theirs in Q3. Pro models are in high demand, cannibalizing the regular 14 and plus models. TSMC's revenue was up something like 30% in Q3. Foxconn also reported record sales. How is it possible that two of Apple's biggest supplier and manufacturer are reporting record sales while smartphone and PC sales in a decline? The answer is, iPhones and Macs sold very well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 01:28:31'] iPhones, iPads, Watch are all way too expensive. Apple has pushed the pricing too far. There’s gonna come a time where device revenue will stagnate.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 14:19:23'] Apple reaching it's all time high for the first time since  only December is not a bearish trend reversal indicator for the entire stock market. Apple of all companies is capable of making continually new highs in an irrational market. 29 PE isn't insane like some other particularly popular stocks, and my DCF shows that it's only slightly overvalued currently. Sure, it *could* drop, but at current valuations I would add to my position if it drops under $140-130.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:44:43'] ATHs are misunderstood. They present amazing buying opportunities. Stocks that break out to ATH, and hold it on retest, generally run.I am getting ready to buy AAPL once it breaks the ATH.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:34:23'] I love Apple but I wouldn’t touch it right now even with somebody else’s dick. It doesn’t make sense to me that it’s almost at ATH again right in the middle of a “technical” recession when in June it was just sitting at $135. Macro is still shit across the board so I think this has gotta be some kind of bull trap to lure longs in then pull the rug on them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:50:44'] I completely agree with this. I think this rally is happening because there is a belief that inflation is going down, but actually it is not. People believe fed will slow rate hikes, higly unlikely imo. Inflation will remain elevated till March 2023 because the first spike happened in March 22, and the prices we see now are going to be the new normandue to wage increaes. But of course, I am not an economist and this is just my personal opinion.When you see AAPL open red, just jump in and sell when you are comfortable. Easy 150$ this morning.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 12:24:10'] I personally think Apple is not a great buy at these levels. It has a high p/e and is exposed to cyclical risk. Also streaming and finance aren’t exactly the best markets to break into, depending on success level, obviously. I’d personally buy Apple on a pull-back.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:54:57'] Apple is basically more likely to breakout to the upside when it hits an all time high.  That's what stocks normally do when they hit all time highs. It's good to be cautious and skeptical.  And you're right about all the things you said. But that's what happens with pretty much every stock when they hit a new high - they tend to hit a few more too. Apple has probably hit 10,000 or more all-time highs in the past 40 years.Edit- lolz people don't like real information. Wow

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 15:13:24'] Been long AAPL since 2007. My best guess is AAPL trades sideways at least until the next earnings. Expect some sell off as it approaches 180. With $6-8 bill in sales delayed due to supply chains (they stated this the last two quarters), that will be realized as things improve. I assume that will pad the numbers even if they come below the revenue or earnings.If rumors are true, they will be announcing the glasses within the next 12 months, which will be the catalyst to take it to 200. Expect a higher PE until earnings/share buybacks catch up. Also, their services were 20% of their revenue Q2. With a happy and satisfied installed base of over 1 Bill device owners, I would expect services to continue growing. People expecting a 15 PE are deluding themselves. AAPL is a different company now compared to 15 years ago.Obviously there are macro and geopolitical risks but those are not unique problems to AAPL.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-16 03:10:54'] Apple silicon is one of the most interesting factors in why I think Apple is going to do great long term. So, I think they will likely grow in value over time.

I’ve done the same for Microsoft as well. Microsoft didn’t get close Friday but flirted with its new number for a brief moment this morning.Just started to learn how to use channels, trendlines, and look at resistance and support. Atm apple is in an upward channel. I don’t know enough about patterns and don’t want to actively learn about them atm when im watching a stock so closely to avoid confirmation biases. It also looks like a rising wedge to me as well but it seems to have broken it Friday and just reset a different one for today. Again I am super green to all of the above so I’m not taking any of this for more than face value. Just trying to observe, make informed predictions with the little I know and then have it tested in the current market.

Thanks for this. When looking at where to put my money right now though, I do feel like I’m getting a bigger discount on growth vs value. So that’s what’s kept me in blended ETFs. Whether that’s actually true or just my perception is another story.I also usually stay out of international stuff. But Europe small cap value is interesting
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 09:36:29'] I am sorry for the length of this post folks (1400 words!); this is more of a compendium of facts about small cap and value stocks. I figured I'd put it all in one place to share all the data I've researched more easily. Honestly, if you just hit the "show images" button on Reddit and scroll through all the figures, you'll get the picture(s).The TL;DR:Tilt this underrepresented asset class (small cap value) because it outperforms the broader market, is less correlated with global market trends, and is at relatively cheap levels. Accomplish this with an ETF like AVUV.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 11:25:10'] Isn't AVUV performing better than Sp500 and NASDAQ? I remember seeing the YTD for AVUV being -13% while the other two are > -20%.

AVUV is a great fund thus far and I have a substantial investment in ArcBest (ARCB), an undervalued freight company with one of the best EV/EBITDA ratios on the market.In the short term, stock price is a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine. Small cap companies with stellar financials are examples of this.

Small caps do well after recessions BECAUSE in the last few recessions, small caps got pounded down by about 60% across the whole index (not just one or two of them). Is the R2000 down 60-70% from peak? Nope. It's not even down -30%!Compare: even the March 2020 crash was -40%. Compare: 2007-2009 was -60%. Therefore expecting historically average outperformance upwards is ridiculous when we haven't seen anything resembling a historically average movement downwards yet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-08 19:37:24'] I get the impression that big tech companies are being pressured to expand in all directions to maintain the 'innovative' perception they have among shareholders, even if the expansion doesn't make sense. Is Apple trying to become a bank? Should Google get into grocery delivery now? I wonder if this really is the best use of Apple's money or just what happens when a company is making so much money it just expands in every direction (GE?). Why not just buy back more shares or put toward the primary business which are actually doing well. JPMorgan has a fortress balance sheet but I don't think they should be getting into self driving cars.Maybe unrelated but I see a sentiment whenever companies announce 'expansions' or 'new acquisitions' and everyone's first take is: "ooh exciting, idk what this has implications for but business is growing, buy buy buy."

There’s too much going on in big tech. It needs to be split up to be fair

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 03:43:15'] There’s very little risk in these short term loans. These are not going to compound over years to the point where the customer can’t pay and forced to file bankruptcy for instance.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:47:58'] The funny thing is that when these "if it gets this low buy all you can buy" prices are hit that means stocks across the board are showing lows. It also means that throwing a dart on a board won't guarantee you good returns. Some small cap today could merge with a medium cap and become a top 10 worldwide stock in the next 10 years. All the mega caps today could just be boring large caps in 10 years. Timing the market doesn't just apply to trying to buy and sell at highs and lows it also applies to thinking you can predict price movements in the future from volatility of today.Whatever is causing the low prices now could cause chaos for a decade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 16:02:30'] The quicker you realize that the market is 100% psychology and no one has any idea about anything the better you’ll be.The only way that $125 is a bottom is if there’s a critical number of people that think $125 is the bottom.Blew my mind when I realized indicators mean absolutely nothing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 17:04:34'] Still long on these 2.Microsoft still dominates the business segment. LinkedIn is a cringefest but there’s no true competitor with the same moats.Gaming? They got XBOX and Activision Blizzard. In Tech?  Most engineers use GitHub.Your customer or your company competes with Amazon? Doing cloud or hybrid? Azure is the most selected second option.Apple? If you have friends that grew up outside of the US you’ll find out that many non Americans are obsessed with status symbols. Many always want to show others that they wear / have only branded stuff - purses, clothing, and yes, phone.As long as there are Indians, Chinese, Africans, Latin Americans, Middle Easterners, (pick any non American ethnicity here) with money, Apple will always have buyers for their products.Yes, they haven’t innovated much. But their services segments are growing, and as long as brand conscious consumers exist, they’ll thrive. Plus they have cash - lots of it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:13:18'] That would be a steeper fall for Apple and something cataclysmic would have to justify that since it should be relatively safe along with MSFT for the time being. Google, Amazon, and Netflix have been taking the brunt of this shellacking in Big Tech. When I hear anyone say companies like Apple and Microsoft would have better valuations if they were down so-and-so, that tells me they’re regretting not getting in around those price ranges
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:10:35'] It all depends on expectations for future profits and interest rates. APPL has a P/E of 25, which is reasonable (if not slightly elevated, historically) but if rates increase let’s say by 200-300 bps and revenue guidance weakens due to supply chain shortages or weak economy overall then might have to go 20-30% lower or even more just to maintain the same P/E ratio.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 13:23:51'] The market is hinged on appl at the moment. Would ideally look at waiting to see how the sp500 reallocates its holdings next quarter. They've forecasted significant headwinds and production reduction which will lead to worse ERs in the future. I do expect at least 2 more major drops before any potential lasting recovery. But that's also tbd.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:57:53'] It can fall a lot. For many reasons. Historically none of them have had this high of a PE for a long time, that said their businesses are pretty awesome now so there is that. Apples PE ratio from 2010 to 2019 has been between 10 and 15. Now its 25 and has been around 30 since 2019. Why wouldn’t it go back to the normal? Markets can be irrational for a long time. One bad quarter and it can drop 30%, just look at netflix, fb and amzn. For me, Apple is to expensive to add at the moment. Plenty of other companies with just as strong growth and moat selling at lower valuations
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:30:55'] One could look at this through the concept of bond yields to earnings ratio.Apple's P/E of 25 was (go calculate new one) quite expensive if bonds keep doing their thing. That's the problem for a lot of this kind of stocks now. Throw in the thought that earnings might even drop, with China shutdown, recession, people not affording luxury goods...**A P/E of 25 represents the same yield as a 4% yielding bond. And the 10 year bond has crossed 3% already.** So if the "risk free" bond is almost the same, stock will extremely likely lose value as that comparison approaches. A drop in earnings will VERY quickly flip this situation to an even worse situation.**Your bonus yield for holding a stock over a "risk-free" bond would only be 1% yearly now. A lot of big money will not like this proposition.****Stocks with over 30 P/E are basically already break-even and in extreme danger. They would need exceptionally trusting investors who trust that earnings growth will keep happening and the company keeps outgrowing this competition from the bonds**And remember, we are talking about company earnings in a potentially very difficult market in the future. Not their current earnings! That is the difficulty.I myself have transitioned last year towards stocks with around P/E of 10. Could think of those that bonds would have to yield 10% to overtake them. Every stock will get hit in an accelerating manner as the break-even approaches, but cheaper earnings right now and their expected continuity helps dampen the fall.TLDR: with this justification could see Apple drop even -20%, IF they whiff on high earnings growth in the next earnings report and bond rise does not settle down. Though can throw in some "safety bonus" because it is Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:55:21'] MSFT is prob the top stock I'm hoping to fall to be able to scope in for cheaps, but know given it's such a powerhouse with super diversified income, don't think it can fall much more than $260, just a pure prediction from where it's currently at, which is $275. It has reached its expected earnings every single quarter, and has a pretty reasonable PE Ratio, certainly compared to most other tech stocks. Personally, wouldn't even be shocked if it's currently now at its floor.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:24:51'] 50% down is still possible. I don’t think it can go to 0
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:43:18'] I just looked this up this morning because I was curious. In recent years (like 2016-2020) when the market was “normal” apple hung out at a very stable P/E ratio oscillated between like 10 and 15. Perhaps reaching those levels again would be equilibrium.>but p/e doesn’t factor in growth Yeah but that doesn’t matter for a company like apple anymore I think they’re so big they’re just going to trade off the money they make
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 15:11:10'] If everything keeps taking a massive shit then probably 210-ish. Just eyeballing the chop at the end of 2020 + "bad thing keeps happening".e: $180 would be a bad time. BUUTT  $$$ on the way back up over the next 2-3 years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 14:17:06'] Looking at the historic price of Apple and their growth rate, their fair value should be around 95$. So it can fall a lot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 16:27:20'] All the people commenting about P/E ratios as if price isn’t merely a reflection of what someone is willing to pay for it. Stocks don’t go up or down based on P/E so please stop commenting this nonsense. If you sit around all day waiting to buy your favorite stocks as soon as it has a more favorable P/E, then you will never succeed. A better way to look at it is that a good amount of stocks are at or below their Covid 2020 bottom. This presents a situation where risk is minimized with easy invalidation for those who wish to actively manage risk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 16:52:09'] Who cares? If the company is really good the stock will do fine 20 years from now. Use bonds and cash for money you need before that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 18:35:12'] Just my personal guess here, I think that we are close to the bottom. I think that once the trend of inflation increasing every month more than the prior month shows its first sign of reversal (which could be as early as this week's report and if not then I think it will happen in next month's report), then I think that is when money starts coming back into the stock market again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 20:45:56'] The current PE is 28. I can see it dropping down to 230… before rallying past $400 in the near future. Or it could sit where it’s at for a bit then start to rally.What I am 90% sure about is that Microsoft will be the biggest SP500 company within the next 5 years. They have been very pro-consumer…In games they have found a way for Fortnite developer to bypass the Apple phone stuff and play on an Apple product. Microsoft is getting heavily involved in the USA military and DoD operations. Azure is becoming more and more integrated with Office. They have gaming by the balls when it comes to Gamepass (Activision and Bathesda). There is so much more room for them to expand.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 22:01:19'] Warren Buffet indicated he bought a lot of AAPL recently when it went closer to $150, and he would have kept buying if it didn’t shoot back up.I sold some AAPL in the fall from a taxable account for $155, hoping to proceeds into a retirement account and buy back in closer to $140. The way things are going I will probably end up reinvesting between $150-$155.I’d hate to try to call a floor on how fall AAPL could fall in the short term, as geopolitical concerns could really impact their supply chains and overseas manufacturing. However, if something like that does happen, I think they have the assets to respond quickly and will be able to right the ship.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 23:57:07'] How do you think we can come up with a somewhat serious number here?My feeling is that neither of them will fall too far, unfortunately. So I don't expect to see MSFT at attractive prices. I don't think 260 would be a very attractive price for them either.Apple I could see having some more weakness than MSFT, but I really don't expect them to go to 120 or so, which, I agree, would probably be an attractive valuation.But that's feeling. And feeling or emotions aren't your friends when investing. And trying to time the market doesn't usually work out. Just evaluate the companies, do your own DD, come up with a buy price based on the return you want and where you expect the company to be in X years. If the company is below that price, you buy and start building your position. If it's above that price, you don't.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-08 01:21:38'] They can go that low.  Both MSFT and AAPL.  2020 and 2021 false rallies and now inflation is going to see us go to $120 or lower for AAPL and has nothing to do with the companies financials.  If the Market crashes it will take them down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-08 03:46:10'] When the whole market crashes the could drop to pre covid. otherwise they will keep in the pe range of 20 -25 imo. all these other american established companies havnt fallen much. its mostly tech, but at some point its ridiculous when coke has higher pe than goog, msft, aapl...

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 22:17:20'] For a rough estimate on how far things can fall, I look back to March 2020, when the world was in full covid-19. Apple fell to $57. Microsoft fell to $137.Now, people can shout that those numbers are ridiculous because Apple and Microsoft are so much bigger than two years ago. But that's the whole point: big drops are based on sentiment: the belief that the good times are over for a while, and that even growing companies will shrink.I would back up my truck and start loading up on Apple as it approaches $60 and Microsoft $150, then DCA is they keep dropping from there.

The fed still hasn’t stopped buying bonds and hasn’t started selling assets to unwind, yet and look at what’s happening.  If the s and p was to follow what happened in 2008 we’ll have one more rally and then a nice drop.  Before it’s all said and done I can see Microsoft dropping to 100-125 and appl touching 50-65.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 06:23:12'] Personally, I'd base this fall on time rather than how far. There's nothing wrong with most of the companies falling. The longer they stay behind the curve the more likely stocks will fall. They want all the money we made or been given in the last 2 years.Forget about the stock price, is apple a good business? Is Microsoft a good business if you believe they are you buy however you still need to consider current climate so having said that you either stager your buys over time to offset and further declines (which it will) or you wait until economic climate turnsBut as an investor and not a trader I don’t care what the stock does in the short term matter of fact I don’t really care that much about the stock as long as it’s not over valued I care more about the business sometimes the stock will lag behind the business if a business is good and it’s getting better then what the stock doesn’t in the short term means nothingMicrosoft will still be Microsoft in 5 years but even bigger with all of the cloud services. Apple will still be apple and everyone will still line up to buy their phones an Amazon will still be AmazonWhat we are seeing is more macro economics coupled with geo politics rather than any individual stocks or even the stock market.

I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).\n\nSo, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:\n\n1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.\n\n2.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:50:33'] TSLA was my immediate thought, but backward.I commute just over an hour each way by car, almost entirely interstate freeway. Buying a Tesla has been a game changer for me. I charge at home, so I never have added stops and don’t spend $800/month on gas anymore. I use the basic autopilot for nearly 2 hours every day. Passing acceleration and driving up hills (I live in the PNW) are cherries on top. I love the car. I also believe the company may be equal to biotech in terms of being absurdly difficult to properly value. There are a number of potential revenue streams (monetizing the app by opening the charging network to other makers, monetizing proprietary charging hardware/hook up, potential ad revenue via app, and a ton of other things), but there’s also the very real chance that none of those things materialize or fail to be meaningful. There are also Elon’s Tweets, which have a massive impact on stock price movement. I love my car, but won’t have direct exposure to the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 09:17:19'] I've been exposed more and more to Apple products in recent years and I am slowly seeing the light. MacBook batteries don't drain, the phones are slick and IOS is slick and the OS equally is slick. It feels like a richer and smoother product compared to windows. There is also native terminal! Its all on face level however. Windows is better, PCs are better, android is better and google is better. But you need a lot of computing knowledge to get there. But overall I can see *why* people buy the products and stay with the products. Tesla has lost all hope from me as a stock holder. All other companies are making EV's , and there is push backs on tesla. Unless they make serious bounds in auto driving there isn't much for Tesla to go. Elon equally name is tainting tesla as a company. He got political and really, even myself, got swept up in his pr campaign when he was first coming around. There is future for tesla for sure. People keep buying them and driving them. But other companies are going to essentially stop teslas growth. Equally, conservatives hate ev's and liberals hate elon...who the hell do you have left?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:49:14'] >I never owned a single Apple productThis is so funny to me, you absolutely think they are overpriced but have never owned one.For phones, the pricing is similar for a similar product. For computers it has always been like that. I have owned Mac's and PC's for 20 years. Mac's always last longer with less issues.The problem is people see a low end PC price and think it compares to a Mac. Look at specs. Mac doesn't make a low end computer.This us vs them for Mac/PC, iPhone/Samsung, XBox/Playstation is so absolutely ridiculous but somehow people believe one is actually better than the other. They are all very comparable.

It’s still the most misunderstood company on the market IMO, and I’m glad it is.There was a time where I considered investing in Apple and Nvidia, but the 2020 breakout for Tesla was just too evident, and the next breakout is even more predictable.This might sound strange but inevitable things are actually inevitable. Look at technological trend and where the demand will be. The recent deal with Ford revealed a lot more than what was in the news headlines.

POST_TEXT: b'Apple ([AAPL.US](https://AAPL.US)) has told some of its contract manufacturers that it wants to increase production outside of China. India and Vietnam, already home to a small portion of Apple\'s global production, are also on Apple\'s shortlist to replace China.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore than 90% of Apple products are manufactured in China by external contractors, such as iPhone, iPad, MacBook, etc. Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked about Apple\'s supply chain and said: "Our supply chain is really global, so products are everywhere, and we will continue to think about optimizing the supply chain."\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple announced in April this year that it would start producing the latest iPhone 13 series at Hon Hais Chennai factory in India. Under this production plan, all of Apple\'s best-selling models are now produced in India through Hon Hai and Wistron.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:40:46'] One of silver-linings of this massive supply chain bottleneck is that companies are just now realizing the huge costs of 'eggs in 1 basket'.I think the next few years will see mega-companies prioritizing logistics over the pennies saved per unit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 12:13:05'] Expect this to continue as China has been too tough on covid shutdowns and is too close to Putin plus presents a Putin-like threat of their own in the future.  Tim Cook has briliantly navigated the China-US tarde wars and other conflicts and made sure Apple was never punished by either the US or China, nor ever used as a bargaining chip, but now Cook sees it being a lot safer to diversify production. Plus India is a huge market for Apple and like china has a massive supply of cheap tech savvy workers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 12:02:18'] If you have a large position like that and are thinking of selling to diversify, sell covered calls on AAPL at a strike price you’d be willing to let some of your shares go. Collect premiums, reinvest those into other stocks, all without having to sell your position at the price it is now. If your shares get called away, you’re selling them at a price your comfortable with all while already having reinvested the premiums to diversify. Win win win.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 13:30:56'] Not sure what your goals are or what the rest of your portfolio looks like, but you've got a nice nest egg going here.My personal opinion is AAPL had a great quarter, but it's obvious they have been slowing down. 9% growth isn't magical. Their 3yr Revenue CAGR is just half that of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. They are growing slower than others &they have a higher P/E Ratio than Google, slightly lower than MSFT, and a much better one than Amazon. I think the market is heavily pricing in growth from something else (Apple Car? Hoping they can grow their higher margin software lines? etc. All legit possibilities, but not guaranteed)With that in mind, You might want to trim *out* of Apple, but I'd still hold most of it. Not sure how risky you want to be, but it may be worthwhile trimming about 25-50k a month and buying VOO until you get down to 500k in Apple or so. Slowly DCA out of AAPL and into the S&P basically.I'm not going to recommend you any specific stocks, but I do think they are slightly overvalued and in the long run it's worth slowly getting all of your eggs out of a single basket. I still like them long term and definitely worth holding a significant position there.If you're more income oriented, could easily put some into SCHD or JEPI along with VOO. Maybe eventually aim for 100k in each of those along with your remaining 400-500k in Apple and you'd have a lot more downside risk protection in the long run IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 09:07:07'] I wouldn't see the point of selling such a great position. Let your winners win. I'd start making a new position in like VTI or something like that though to build over time. And when Apple gets back up maybe sell some then and move it over. I wouldn't sell it when it's down right now though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 09:34:59'] omg that's huge. But on the other hand... 7 years. How much did you invest in total?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 10:41:32'] Buffett disclosed in the annual meeting today that they bought more Apple in Q1. You are in good company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 13:15:11'] Honestly? I know this is r/stocks, but I'd probably put some part in  VTI or SPY. Broad exposure, still substantial gains over the years, significantly lower risk than individual stocks, that sounds about right regarding potential family responsibilities.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 23:22:23'] I mean, contextually, how much of your net worth is in Apple? Like, is 730 the entire portfolio or is it 50% of the portfolio? I have a sizeable apple position, but I also have a paid off house and 401k that is it's own investments. So the downside is low risk  terms of will it have a devastating impact but even I eventually want to diversify to lower the risk of my NW.  Basically, answer changes massively on context. Do you own a home? Is your current income enough to easily pay your family's expenses? Do you need the money in the next short while (e.g. planning to buy a home?) If so, are you comfortable taking an equity backed loan instead of selling equities?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 12:03:56'] I bought in around 2008, but pared along the way. Still at about 50% of my portfolio though. It is risky to hold so much in one stock, so I plan to diversify more. I have been selling covered calls that then have been called away. Also have been selling enough the last few years to not have a huge tax hit in any one year. I would DCA average out of it over time and into other picks or ETFs to diversify.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 12:18:40'] You have about 3400 shares that are generating about 775/quarter.   Selling the shares will likely result in a decent capital gain hit, so if I were you, I’d likely invest the 775 into a VTI, SCHD or something low cost.   3-4 shares a quarter but after 10 years, you’ll keep the aapl, and have built a 125-150 share position in VTI, that will also be generating a small dividend payment.  I know it’s not sexy, but at this point aapl is prob one of the better shares to keep in your portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 12:51:35'] It’s hard to diversify away from them because they’re quite a big holding in VTI and VOO by cap weighting. I would look into some non-tech stocks.  Energy sector but mid to large cap for stability. XOM has a good dividend. Consumer services like TGT/Walmart. Or VXUS could be a good way to diversify outside of the US market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 18:40:49'] In a similar situation. I didn't have a family when I started and now am on a huge pile of AAPL. It makes so much sense to diversify but then I think about the time I did and it went 3x in a year. I feel like I could lose it all and still be a good dad and husband. Maybe I couldn't set my kids up with a killer inheritance, but they'd be fine. Is this stock your retirement or 529? If not, I say let it roll. Apple will be higher in ten years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 21:00:59'] I would suggest reading up on the following topics:* **Creating equity collars via options contracts** (ie selling a call and using the proceeds to purchase puts). There are potential tax consequences to this strategy that require extra attention. You really don't want to convert a long-term cap gain into a short term cap gain due to lack of attention.* **Building a completion portfolio** (ie diversifying by steering additional purchases or proceeds of sales into positions that round out your exposures). You'll want to pay attention to the cost basis of specific lots when planning sales. You'll also want to pay attention to correlations between Apple and any new positions (eg Energy or Healthcare is going to help more than a consumer discretionary or tech related firm). * **Exchange mutual funds** These funds facilitate diversification by permitting a stock owner to deposit their shares into a fund in exchange for shares of the fund. Your cost basis in the new fund shares will be that of your deposited stock. Sometimes they have fairly high net worth requirements, and they often have lock up provisions. I'm not crazy about them, but suggest that you learn about them to be aware of the pros and cons versus other strategies.I strongly recommend that you explore working with a professional wealth manager that is willing to help you draft an investment policy statement and talk to you about the concept of risk buckets. It can really help keep things in focus.I further suggest that you try to avoid firms that are really into a boiler plate process at the expense of personalized advice. They are more likely to try and convince you to simply convert things over on their terms and to gloss over details that have huge tax implications at your expense. For what it's worth, one of the well-worn clichés in investment management goes something like this: *If you want to make a lot of money, having all of your money in one great stock can get you there. If you want to keep a lot of money, make sure you're diversified.*I know that my post reads like a homework assignment, but I think those topics will serve you well. They're also potentially tricky. Feel free to dm me if you have questions.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 21:21:01'] You're sorta inspiring me to stick with just $GOOGL instead of getting into AMZN and TSLA as well. I love the sole laser focus idea you had with Apple, but with Google instead.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 01:01:29'] you could buy a share of BRK-A.  But they are stingy and don't pay a dividend.  They also own a lot of AAPL.  GOOG and AMZN are looking cheap too, but could get cheaper.  Smart thing to do though is just put it all in VOO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 03:58:21'] \- if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.Nothing at all wrong with Apple, - you'd be hard pressed to find a better company to diversify into. There's a few like Coca Cola, Walmart, P&G that just do exactly what they say on the tin. Stocks that you can sleep at. night to.. so just keep the status quo.Like Buffet says - Diversification is a protection against ignorance,

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 07:35:53'] Alibaba is my biggest holding for many reasons, they are extremely undervalued, I can go into more detail if you wish but they will 100% double in the next 3-5 years imo
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 11:34:23'] Apple is on 50ma weekly chart and has been bouncing there for years now. They haven't let it break under there. Check it out
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 16:54:12'] Similar to you I am 80% AAPL now. I added to my position in BRK.B and GOOG a few months ago. I want to buy more BRK.B but currently sitting at only like 2% cash. I’m thinking about trimming my other small positions and consolidating them into BRK.B in the next year or so. I also thought about I-Bonds but the $10k limit isn’t going to help me do what I need.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 08:15:17'] If you're wanting dividends but don't care about growth, check out r/dividends who will suggest income funds like QYLD, KBWD, or SPHD. If you want something strong and sturdy to go into, think HD, KO, or 3M.If you're feeling like you want to be risky without going into options but still give dividends, COF, WMT, or JNJ.Or just say fuck it and put it all into ETFs that have performed strongly even during recessions
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 09:26:00'] You keep on holding for next 10 years. Never sell your winners and pay taxes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 10:59:27'] My personal advice is that’s a killer position to have. Apple just had a stellar quarter and is being brought down by the broader market. If you can, I’d say hold, but you know your situation better than anyone of us.Edit: also if supply chain constraints ease in 0-5 years, Apple will be a huge beneficiary as they have been hindered by suppliers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 08:26:07'] Im here for the downvotes, but seriously GME is a worthwhile company to put a few bags into.It's seriously primed to explode once the shorts are shaken off in the next year or so.if anything, its a safe hedge play. Its got tonnes of cash flow, 1b+ of cash on hand, huge overhaul of executives (top talent from amazon and other tech companies) and the board is not being paid bonuses with cash anymore meaning they're vested in its success.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 10:08:05'] Sell a small portion every year so that you dont pay as much tax but consult a tax agent first. Diversify to ETF VOO or VTI.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 03:12:24'] Dam i should’ve bought moree
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 12:02:54'] I would trim the position slowly, certainly not by 25k-50k per month as others here have suggested and certainly not into VOO which is basically all tech. I would wait for AAPL to come back to ATH's (which they will almost certainly after their latest quarter) and go for value/dividends. You're in your 30's so that 730K position can grow handsomely just by reinvested dividends over the years. You made a smart (or lucky) decision, held it through some volatility, and it certainly paid off. Don't take on any more risk than you need to. You should be able to take a couple mill in 20 years and live the rest of your life comfortably off the dividends.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-02 03:57:27'] Speak to a tax professional who knows your specific situation. You don't want to be stuck with a six figure tax bill for 2022. Remember that if you make a certain amount all capital gains is taxed as regular income.Assuming you can squeak some sales by at a lower tax bracket, I'd unload some of those AAPL holdings per year until it gets to a reasonable amount. If you're investing for retirement, no single stock should be over 10-20% of your total investments. Put that money into Vanguard total stock market, admiral shares or similar.

In contrast, long-run inflation expectations were little changed from May at 3.0%, again staying within the narrow 2.9-3.1% range for 22 of the last 23 months. Long-run inflation expectations remained elevated relative to the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 11:56:21'] I dunno how ya’ll are feeling, but to me it’s kinda crazy how different the vibes are in the market for 2023 comparatively to 2022. I did not think any green that happened during 2022 would last and every morning when I saw green I was highly skeptical and just assumed it would end red lol.Now in 2023, I feel the complete opposite. Any day I see even a bit of red I assume it’s instantly gonna get bought up and that we will end green.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 13:44:10'] Why do people constantly say the market topped when there is just one red day? Shouldnt those type of calls wait for multiple red days in a row lol.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-07 18:42:30'] Why are you looking for dividends? Think about it this way. If a company pays you cash what will you do with it?I’d much rather the company keep the cash and reinvest it. Look for a company with a good return on assets. Share buybacks are better then dividends. Not taxed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-07 19:22:51'] In this economic environment, a stock that is at 52 week lows with a high dividend is likely not being run very well. You aren't thinking clearly here, you just want the best of all worlds.If you want a high dividend and a good company, the share price will be high enough right now. Oil stocks come to mind. I like Enbridge a lot and they have a huge moat in Canada. That's my biggest dividend payer and I'll hold long term until something changes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-07 23:47:12'] ZIM or AAPL
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-08 04:14:55'] The one with the smallest dividend and best return.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-08 07:19:44'] AAPL clearly the best, MSFT second.  AAPl at 169 today, a nice bargain, almost inflation proof plus they are the strongest dominators on earth, including for mastering the supply chain.

POST_TEXT: b"Mentally its tough to keep buying with non-stop red days. Heres a long term perspective to consider.\n\nAAPL is now down 30%, but a return to all time high means a 183/129 = 42% return. If youre happy with an average annual return of 10%, then buying now means AAPL has 4 years to get back to ATH in order for it to be a good investment for you. \n\nObviously a faster return to ATH gives an even better average return. (I oversimplify the math a little by ignoring compounding)\n\nA similar analysis on these blue chips shows that a return to ATH in,\n\n- MSFT: 4.5 years\n\n- GOOG: 5 years\n\n- AMZN: 8 years\n\nWould equate to an average annual return of ~10%. \n\nIf your time horizon is more than a few years, these are great times to be in the market.\n\n\nEDIT: Most people seem to think I'm legitimately asking the question in the title. I'm not, this is a way to mentally reframe the market outlook without any real analysis (just simple math). Enjoy the stock sale."

Not only will the multiple compress as growth slows (Apples average multiple is around 15), but their earnings will erode as well. Same thing for Amazon, who also has the problem that logistics will eat lots of their margins. Google will see growth slowing due to advertisements stopping from many of the unprofitable tech companies stopping.Microsoft is probably the best bet, but they are historically overvalued as well. I think it is more likely that they decline an additional 30% from here, than rising back to ATH in the next 3. In 4 years.. maybe

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-17 03:17:23'] It can. But if valuations become and stay somewhat reasonable/fair, I don't think it will unless it absolutely blows expectations out the park. I think 150-160 is more likely than a new ATH.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-17 03:48:25'] I think the best part of apple is that they've got so much cash they can just endlessly buy back shares at lower prices and keep reducing the total number.  That really limits downside IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-17 04:15:47'] 100% a great question and solid analysis, IMO. MY take is that why not buy the S&P 500 Index Fund ETF, VOO or SPY, which hold all of the stocks you mention above as their 4 biggest holdings (more or less)?On top of that you get a piece of all the other great companies in the US, like: Home Depot, Visa, Berkshire, United Health, etc...If I were compelled to buy ONE of the big tech companies, right now, I would choose Google. I just think that their search engine is a part of every young persons like, many times a day, I think YouTube is an unbelievable platform with fantastic content if you're looking in the right areas AND I think the Cloud is on the verge of profitability, which will add another HIGH margin business to their bottom line. Not to mention that they are going to be rolling out wearables and that could be another moat for the company. There is a lot to be excited about for the long term with current market prices and, personally, I think that we still have a little bit of pain to go through to get to the bottom, which means outsized returns for both the intermediate AND long term!Best to you and solid post.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-17 05:47:37'] This is flawed reasoning.  Is 4 years some sort of magic timeline?  If it only returns 20% by year 4 then 100% in year 5, does any of this analysis matter?

On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.\n\nA lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher.

Combined they have 2.7 billion people. Their new SE will be the most popular 5G phone in these countries this year. I said this years ago when Apple was developing their custom chip for Macs and I will say it again. This is a massive innovation and has long lasting implications. The M1 is the most efficient chip on the planet and their US computer market share is around 10%. My MacBook Air replaced 3 computers when I bought it in 2021. In a few years we will see massive adoption as Apple continues to make the best computers that are reasonably priced. Finally, we have new products coming out. Apple wants to control the hardware that you need to access the internet whether it’s on the go or at home or at work. Their next device will almost definitely be innovative and everyone will want it. Mobile devices are here to stay and I can’t imagine anyone coming even close to the system that Apple has built.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 21:51:46'] There a couple of reasons. A lot of tech companies are simply being priced on growth and not enough on fundamentals. Now the market is getting more risky and many stocks like Netflix and fb are falling from their sky high valuations everyone wants something stable and solid with good fundamentals but also a strong moat. Apple has a lot of cash, solid fundamentals and a great moat. I heard that during the pandemic apple was one of the few companies that had enough cash that even if they had to shut down all sales of all products online and in person they could pay all their staff for like 2 years on full salary. That is tremendous financials. They’re also expanding more into services sector and producing their own chips and leaving intel behind.

If I recall, they made more last year on airpods than spotify made top line.   Apple is also considered a 'safety' stock due to these attributes. The higher yields and cost of borrowing mean nothing to a company like this, as they generally only issue debt to conduct share buybacks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 08:37:14'] This is probably an unpopular opinion, but is anyone concerned about AAPL’s products? I recently purchased both the latest iPhone and specced out MacBook Pro and I’m pretty underwhelmed - especially with the phone. It feels like there’s been a gradual decline in quality since Steve Jobs passed. I know they’ll probably continue to dominate as they have a lot of brand loyalty… but it does start to wear thin. Good friends of mine used to queue for every iPhone that was released and they’ve stopped bothering with the last two releases.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 09:33:52'] AAPL is always a great pick as long as you believe the company is still on the right path. Very glad that I loaded up on more shares when it hit $150 a few weeks ago
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 10:55:25'] Until I see a legitimately competitive walled garden ecosystem with as high quality HW, SW, and durability, along with the trust that Apple has earned from their users, who are insanely loyal... Then I'll be a permabull on Apple. Subjectively speaking, I think they are the most extraordinary company in the world, especially from a management perspective. Their product roadmap has been ingenious and their ability to strategize their revenue to fund their R&D is simply delightful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 11:35:35'] They have more cash than anyone. Best company in the world.  Period
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 12:29:12'] I expect both Apple and Google to have more regulatory issues in the coming 5 years. They are monopoly like in several of their products. For example app store, google search, google maps etc. So risk that Apple is peak multiple on peak earnings right now. Would chose other FAANG-companies before it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 13:54:00'] Well being that apple controls the entire Senate and house of representatives, plus they have the most demanded status symbol known to human kind... That might be enough to drive them to a $1 trillion market cap stimulus and that means it has to be a $10 trillion market cap post stimulus due to the extra zero needed to be added to every price post stimulus.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 14:46:54'] The fed tightening is an X factor for sure, maybe the tighten too fast and raise interest too fast and we get a recession. But ask yourself this, for how long?The war in Ukraine matters little for Apple's business. It's not a huge part of their sales and any supply issues that come from that won't be huge; Apple has been dealing with supply issues for the past 2 years and navigating them easily.For the 10 year yield, Apple has opportunity to grow more than 2-3% per year within that time frame so how many people are really going to care about the yield? Some for sure especially those closer to retirement but would you really trade the potential in Apple for a 2-3% yield over time? u/Malamonga1 also correctly pointed out that this changes the DCF model so that higher returns are to be expected which I think can happen with what I discussed. Companies have shown that they can pass their costs onto consumers so unless we have a financial crisis, Apple's costs are going to be passed on. Even during a financial crisis their products are quasi luxury and luxury goods tend to fare better.The fed tightening is an X factor for sure, maybe the tighten too fast and raise interest too fast and we get a recession. But ask yourself this, for how long? The big companies like apple have had the best debt levels in years, in the sense their interest rates are low and debt service is low. They have stupid amounts of cash to invest so they are primed to easily weather recessions.Lastly, Apple's potential is what really does it for me. Increase in revenue from services, potentially licensing hardware, content for movies and shows, electric vehicles, glasses, and whatever other product they'll get in to. I don't think people understand how much money apple makes compared to how many products they have. Glasses alone would increase their revenue by billions. And then there is of course the potential for innovations that tech companies make that can make them money in ways we can't think of right now. And, if you look at their revenue, you see crazy growth in in 2021 and that's likely to continue in 2022 and that's WITH supply chain issues.One more thing as well, share buy backs and dividends. So yeah, I'm for Apple as an investment and they're current multiples don't scare me away based on what I see for their future. I just DCA small amounts every once in a while when I can and don't plan on stopping.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 15:57:35'] Because yields are still low now. My guess is that stocks will begin to fall later in the year as inflation doesnt subside n rate hikes continue.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 16:32:23'] I'm not selling but also not buying.  I wonder if Apple is seen as a safe haven stock.  Normally in high inflation, interest rates are also high so people can put it in something safe like bonds or a savings account.  But its TINA and so ppl are picking big tech.Also a lot of bears think Apple revenue was pulled forward because of COVID and they'll go back to 1-5% revenue growth which I don't think is going to happen for various reasons.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 16:56:50'] Apple is to the smartphone like Coca-Cola is to soda. Even if someone out-innovates Apple (some new device we haven’t thought of), Apple will refine it and make a better version that will be another money making machine.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 08:48:26'] Not all dividend stocks are 0% growth. Look at KO: 12% annual growth and ~3% dividend yield over the last 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 09:46:33'] I have stocks that are down 75%. Why? Because I thought that they were good value when I bought them, and having reevaluated in light of the fall, I think the potential gains as a factor of the odds of those gains outweighs the risk involved. I could well be wrong and they could go to zero, but it's based on my analysis of the relevant markets as updated by recent events.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 11:27:00'] I'll raise you this: Why would I start a position in a  stock I expect to return 5% per year when I could just buy the index and beat that on average?And if I wanna be really defensive I can just buy 10 year bonds for 3%  return.Obviously it's a bit different if I'm already in Apple from years back, so I'll talk strictly about starting a position here.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 08:23:51'] Why are you worried what other people think? If you believe in Apple stock, keep buying it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 08:34:54'] Let people think what they want to think lol. Everyone is at a different stage in their life which means people have different strategies. If I was near retirement, less volatile stocks with a dividend payout would be more attractive to me than an extremely volatile growth stock. If you're invested in a growth stock that trades flat, you should be upset since you could have been in that dividend-paying value stock you mentioned since you could have been getting some form of return during this time of uncertainty in the market. Obviously if you're young and have time on your hand, just ignore the noise because these flat years mean nothing in the long term. Just note that not everyone's strategy is long term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 13:05:01'] Well, the thing is that apple is certainly not 5%. The share buyback alone is 3.5% and a growth of probably 7-8. Not enough to justify a pe of 30 though, I think that is the problem. It seems that past performance is reflected in current pe for most of the stock darlings, and it's conflicting with the future.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 14:08:28'] Apple is an iconic brand. They consistently release products with specs that don’t stand up to the competition and still blow them out of the water in sales.

The people making their phones make like 5 cents a day and our country has collectively decided to turn a blind eye. This is a fucking juggernaut of a company, they could drop 20% in the next 2 years and I would just keep buying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 15:58:26'] I remember when people avoided Apple stock like the plague. Every analyst and pundits put down the iPhone every chance they got. Negative news 24/7.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 16:06:14'] MSFT for sure.  It is a beast.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 13:18:19'] AAPL for shorter investment. They are making good use of design updates and Apple silicon should continue to be good IMO.MSFT for long long hold.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 22:25:10'] You could go with some narrower funds, like XLC (22% FB) and VGT (20% AAPL, 17% MSFT).That gives you significant exposure to all 3 along with lesser exposure to stuff like Visa, Adobe, Google, Netflix, Disney, etc.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 18:34:45'] AAPL and MSFT, Maybe about 1800 into MSFT, 1200 into AAPL. Apple is a status brand, it's reliable, their products are good, and they're hyping the Apple car a lot, I think they're pretty safe and offer a good amount of growth over the next 5-10 years.MSFT is beastly. As someone who wishes they could add to his position, I think they're poised for some serious growth, especially with their cloud computing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 03:15:15'] I work in tech and I have a self-managed portfolio of tech stock, which includes MSFT, GOOG, FB, and TSLA. AAPL is overvalued is my opinion and I don’t like how concentrated their revenue is around the iPhone (58%) whereas I like that MSFT is more diversified and that they are the #2 player in cloud. FB is sitting on an advertising gold mine, but as we’ve seen, they face a lot of scrutiny and I believe they need to mature as a company. I like GOOG because they’re still king of the hill in ads, but also because they’re #3 in cloud. I like TSLA because, well, I own a Model 3 and it’s the best car I’ve ever driven by far … the stock hasn’t done too badly either. 😏 You might also want to consider an index fund so your risk is spread a bit - my favs are FNILX, VOO, SPY and SPXX.

AAPL has stopped innovating and only churns out slightly improved cameras on iphone. Their new M1 processor is ok but ppl are not flocking to buy them. Everyone already has an iPhone and no one overly keen on 2000 phone with no new innovative feature. FB is losing revenue due to Apple enforcing privacy features, political backlash, also its 20 yr old tech, now they are trying out Metaverse thing with virtualization, more cartoonish looking gimmick.

They’re making smart moves like building their own processors, but they’re still very hardware driven overall.- MSFT has seen tremendous growth in software and services with no sign of stopping anytime soon. They’re up considerably in overall Windows users, Teams monthly active users, Xbox service subscribers, and more. They’re also establishing long-term partnerships with companies like Sony and SEGA among many others to utilize their Azure cloud service on long-term contracts. MSFT has continued to raise their dividends for investors year-over-year and as their net income continues to rise, I expect the dividends and stock price to as well.Disclaimer: I own securities in MSFT and AAPL.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 22:39:42'] Googl. Three reason for that:1. Monopoly on informationIn this day and age, information = power = money. Google is the strongest, most UNBEATABLE name in information gathering/utilization/creation etc. That means Google will forever have demand and a huge competitive advantage.This impacts many different fields that I don't have time to write about. The two most important ones though are advertising and AI. On those two topics, Google has an unchallenged lead, and will continue having an unchallenged lead basically forever. There's just no competing with Google's quality and quantity of information at this point.2. Income diversification: Although this point is true also for FB and MSFT, it is truest for Google: a US/dollar collapse will not affect Google as badly as most US based companies, because it has guaranteed non- dollar denominated income from across every continent, which will continue streaming also in difficult economic times. In a stagflation environment (which is the greatest risk right now for many countries including America) you want to have this kind of diversification. 3. R&D:Google's R&D team is creating some fascinating research on a wide variety of topics. In the last year, for example, they used AI to solve a long- unsolved question about the 3D structure of protein folding, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. With superior data, superior engineers/ AI experts, and a company policy of allowing their workers to pursue interesting problems, Google is slowly gathering more and more breakthroughs to its name.

AAPL is safe too I would say.I personally own FB and MSFT and buying more FB, I think the company is a serious money making machine and underappreciated by the market mostly due to all the negative sentiment around the brand and continuous fear of anti - trust hit. They still have a few billion left for stock buyback by the EOY too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 03:55:51'] MSFT.  They're safe with a good dividend and growth that's accelerating. Being Amazon's primary competitor says something, but Microsoft is also doing its own thing rather than trying to play catchup with the former like other big tech companies. Apple is safe as well but I think you'll grow impatient with how much slower the price action has been lately and they may be in the congressional crossfire of regulations and breakups.  No to Facebook. It's dirty money that no amount of Meta can convince you that you'll one day fly like Neo in The Matrix.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 04:23:02'] I'd look real hard at buying as many shares of the QYLD ETF as you can (130 at this time) and collect your monthly dividends from it. Reinvest the dividends, and your position should grow pretty quickly.QYLD ETF is an index fund that sells covered calls on the top 100 Nasdaq companies, and pays the dividends using the covered call premiums. If you just want to park the money, this is a pretty compelling place to do it.You won't make giant gains due to the nature of covered calls, but you should make pretty consistent profits. I'm looking at this myself, although I like to be active with my positions.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 10:58:08'] i started buying AAPL in 2015. This came after realizing a had a trading addiction. I was destroying myself financially by YOLOing before Robinhood made it fashionable. I disabled options trading ( except for put writing/ covered calls ),  and studied both Bogleheads and Buffet. So I have benefited enormously from AAPL - there were a lot of pullbacks during the last 6 years, and sideways trading periods. but I took on the Buffet notion of stocks as owning assets in a company and not as abstract symbols where you focus on the ups and downs of price, but look at the long term.   i held through it all, ignored the 2020 crash and just kept going about my life.. obviously the time since then has accelerated everything greatly.  My apple shares unrealized gains are spectacular. Are we finally "too toppy" at 180 and a 3 trillion dollar market cap? Maybe, but i find it hard to pull the trigger. Not just because I still believe in AAPL for the next few years, even if there is a pullback, but also because it feels like selling would be going back to the old me that tried to time the market. Maybe I am foolish but until Berkshire dumps its 40 percent portfolio share of AAPL I might reconsider.. until then maybe it is better to just remind myself that stocks are going to  both down and up but the real question is .. what will it be worth 5 years out?

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 07:37:43'] I find it funny how everyone says their sudden run up isn't justifiable and not based on fundamentals but yet we have stocks like Nvidia who has a PE ratio of like 266 who has had crazy runs (and keeps getting more analysts recommending to BUY) or any other tech stock. Even Microsoft has a higher PE ratio then Apple as well but no one seems to bat an eye on their run up. Apple has had slower growth this year compared to Microsoft and Google so it seems like after consolidation Apple has broke out. Yes, Apple's PE ratio currently is higher than it's been at 31 and growth for the next two years is going to be sluggish but the prospects of Apple's next wave of innovation and the flight for safety is driving this run up. Apple has developed their reputation that everything they throw out on the market turns into gold so it's probably safe to say the new AR glasses which will come out in the next 18 months most likely will be the new hot thing along with a gateway to the metaverse and whatever that entails. Then the Apple car which isn't coming out soon but if it does come out may just revolutionize driving. The apple ecosystem is a titan. Then other aspects like strong stock buyback over the years and a very healthy balance sheet has ensured Apple to be the safest stock.I think Apple stock will stagnate for the next two years as growth will be somewhat limited in the next two years and YoY comparisons won't look too good but once their next wave of products start to hit in 2023 or so Apple may just add another trillion or so. This is a long term hold and you don't bet against Apple.

I've been trying to buy an iPad for months now, the latest ship date is late January. iPhones are short too, which means lower revenues.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 10:36:38'] I've sat through 3 AAPL splits, I'm up more than 1000%. The only time I ever lost money on AAPL was when I had to sell some because I needed the money, and then of course it would go up. If I had tried to "trade" APPL, covered call, etc, I doubt I would be where I am at now.I add to apple whenever there is a dip or they make a new product announcement, when they make a new product announcement I buy the amount of stock equal to the most expensive product they announce.

Its like 0.2% of my portfolio so I’m not sweatin it, I just think now at 170+ it is extremely overpriced.  It could run right up to 200 I suppose.

Bought 140 more shares, bought 20 more shares, bought 15 more,It split again 4/1. We have 840 shares, just over $150,000. It’s our largest holding, it’s truly been our steady rock solid investment. And all the while, still an Apple fan, love the leadership there, love the direction they are going. Buy and hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 00:31:58'] It's way overpriced, at least from a relative valuation standpoint. This is at a P/E of 33 after a 60% earnings bump due to covid. Could stay flat for five years and it would still be fairly valued.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 11:29:22'] Apple is staring at a massive upcoming bump in the road and I'm surprised no one here is talking about it: [https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/)This is not some minor hiccup. This is a major chunk of revenue that is likely going to be greatly diminished before long. Revenue that had the highest profit margin and lowest overhead of any of their revenue generators may be going away. Once more 3rd party app developers understand that they do not have to give apple 30% of in app purchases anymore, your going to see a lot more "light" versions of apps show up in the store that are baseline functional, but will require in app purchases directly through their 3rd party sites(bypassing apple and their skimming off the top) to unlock the full featured program. As it stands 70% of in app revenue that apple was taking was mostly from a handful of free to play mobile games(such as EPIC's Fortnight) that can now offer customers the ability to pay for in app purchases directly from the developer, cutting apple out of the purchase. Some will even be willing to incentivize costumers doing so by charging them less to go direct, rather than through apple's portals.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 07:01:10'] I trust some of what the news outlets explain, AAPL being a safe investment during interest rate increase fear and other fears.But also need to remember, it is still December and people are still probably tax loss harvesting. I don't plan to sell anything out of AAPL (It is the smallest position in my portfolio with almost 8% anyhow). I think people would put the money into AAPL (instead of an ETF or cash) while they wait to take it out and invest back into the companies they sold out of (assuming they still believe in those companies and only wanted to reduce taxes).It is possible that AAPL will correct downwards near the end of the month or the beginning of January.Just my thought though, I am not a trader so I don't bother selling even if I think something will go down.

My guess is we see a bit more of a rise on the back of Christmas/EOY market rally, but that on the next few bigger market slump days it corrects to a plateau in the mid-160s-ish — something still much high than what its been at the last 6 mos but not quite to the current price degree.Macro level, I think it continues to go up and up. As others have said - AR/VR, cars, etc. There’s a lot of room to get investors excited about new growth despite the giant market cap. I think it remains that there are few things safer than betting on Apple in mid-long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-12 12:19:24'] Holding for the long run and scalping its options for short term profits. It’s a safe stock to both hold and trade, since the contracts are cheap and long term prospects are still positive.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 20:15:32'] I don’t see Apple or Google dropping that much… the reason I don’t see it is because the whole market would need to drop 40-50% for this to happen. So much is wrapped into these two companies in the SP500, especially for Apple.Google has a higher chance in my opinion to drop more. Apple could like any stock could drop that much… but this would knock down SP500 3% by itself. Every paycheck, there’s a fight to make these stocks go higher….For perspective, the SP500 would need to drop further than what it did for COVID’s bottom. The PE would be roughly 10 for each… which is possible, but I think the internet changed things and people know anything under 15 PE is a bargain. A 50% cut for each would most likely result in the SP500 going back to 2014 levels.I hope it does because of my time horizon, but there’s a lot of innovation going on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-20 23:10:52'] Something would have to happen to make them drop 50%. And that something would turn off the buyers or else it wouldn't have dropped 50% in the first place. So to answer the question, no, you probably wouldn't buy it. There are numerous stocks that are down 50% from their highs right now where people said they would buy it if it dropped 50%. How many of them are backing up the truck after the drop actually happened?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-21 07:43:38'] Agreed if they hit those prices, I'm buying but the probability of hitting those lows is less than 20% in my view.  A collapse like in 2008 is needed and we don't have that condition.

But if I had to guess, I'd say 140-150 makes far more sense.As for potential "super cycle" - what makes you think that?What's more, how big do you expect a company that's already valued well above 2.6T at this point? You know, unlimited growth isn't really something that exists.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-30 18:01:17'] $110 before $190.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 02:01:37'] Who knows. I have been buying it all bear market long. Just trimmed all my $145ish shares when a high cost limit order went through on a rally. I am holding all my $131 shares and hope to load up on more in the 130s.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 04:23:26'] I think it will be fine long term.  But right now AAPL is pretty pricey compared to some other options.Take Google.   Last quarter put up 13% growth compard to 2% for Apple.   But Google also has a P/E of 22 versus Apple with 27.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 07:22:33'] Just own it and hold it.   Timing is anyone's guess but over the longterm this is likely a $300 stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-31 20:50:05'] It will test ATH but there will be a lot of sellers around 175 and 180. There needs to be another catalyst to breakthrough ATH. Probably the new glasses next year. Long term absolutely hold.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 14:23:47'] They are still generating 27B+ of FCF. Those are phenomenal numbers in this market with high inflation and other macro factors($ is still too strong). They grew sales in Europe and Rest of APAC minus china/japan. That shows how much potential is there for Apple. I have been holding AAPL since 2017 and have been buying with DRIP as well. Only once I lost few hundred shares as my Covered Call got invoked as stock ran up too fast :-) I aint even doing that again. just keeping these stocks until I feel Apple has lost its brand value.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 13:47:56'] Overall very happy with this report especially since we seen companies like Microsoft, Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm all do a terrible job in hardware sales.iPhone sales actually increased from a year ago. Big surprise for me. Mac sales had a massive decline. This is what people were expecting considering previous earnings of the other tech companies we saw from computer sales. iPad also declined but not as bad as I was expecting.Wearables and accessories was flat which still shows there is resilience even in this slowing economy. Services increased again. This was to be expected and helped soften the blow from the declines in other divisions like Mac and iPad. Declines of sales in the Americas, China, and Japan. However increases in both Europe and the Rest of Asia Pacific.They also announced a 4% increase in their dividend as well as a massive 90 billion dollar stock buyback. Overall I am completely fine with the quarter especially giving the low expectations people had which you can see in the expectation’s Wall-Street had. Thank you Tim Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 16:27:03'] No one's talking about Apple's new HY savings account, which literally [flooded Apple and Goldman Sachs with nearly $1 billion in 4 days](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2023/05/01/apples-new-savings-account-draws-nearly-1-billion-in-deposits-in-the-first-four-days/?sh=3cc572d44e4a) a few days ago.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 14:03:17'] Annualized, these numbers make Apple a top 50 economy in the world. Their market cap puts them into the top 20. What is this reality we're living in?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 13:38:09'] A pretty decent quarter, all things considered.  Mac and iphone revenue was down from last year, but not as bad as expected. A 90 billion dollar buyback is huge, but honestly, kind of expectedEdit: I was wrong, iphone revenue was up

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 18:20:42']   Based on the information provided, this news appears to be bullish for Apple. Apple reported earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, which is generally seen as a positive sign for investors. Additionally, the stronger-than-anticipated iPhone sales are also a positive indicator for the company. While Apple's overall sales fell for the second quarter in a row, the positive news on earnings and iPhone sales suggests that investors may be optimistic about the company's future performance.

"I do not think it likely that the outcome of this litigation would substantially affect Disney's (DIS) share price," he said.

He said the Fed is committed to seeing the unemployment rate drop 1 point or more, and in 12 out of 12 times that has happened, it has induced a recession and the S&P has dropped.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 11:05:32'] So $MVST Microvast is up 10% today despite being investigated by Schall Law (potential investor class action suit) for not disclosing ties to the Chinese Communist Party?

How the hell can we expect ANYONE to be able to what will happen several quarters from now, a year from now?Recession, soft-landing, mid-cycle downturn... no one damn knows which is why you should focus on investing in something that looks undervalued to you and you're willing to hold for a long time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 09:23:36'] Should bears APOLOGIZE for being so wrong so often? Especially with their vitriol spewed against bulls. I get not trusting there to be a soft landing given past events, but the fed has navigated this absolutely flawlessly.

Lost money on CRM and AVGO.Added some calls in USO to play the OPEC meeting this weekend. Had calls in MP and TECK already and added ALB. Those all did well.Anyways, hope this big move into cyclicals isn't just a big head fake.Sold my last call in NVDA... it was good to Sep but I think NVDA drops before it goes up so took my 800% gain.Had a great week overall.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 06:24:45'] I don’t really play options , but anyone thinking of doing puts for hotels or airlines for later this year? Feels like consumer will be tapped out after this summer travel season. Could be good opportunity. Possibly move into the XLP now, since it’s been underperforming and follows the same logic. Consumer will be spending primarily on staples. Should be interesting to see the impacts on the economy with student loans coming back. Just some thoughts/ideas.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:26:51'] There's 0 risk in this market. Another 3/4 green week for QQQ. Every single dip, instant V. We are making history with the single, greatest most unstoppable QQQ/tech rally ever. It's not even debatable. Every other rally had pullbacks/ temporary setbacks, but this just goes flat and consolidates rather than even having a real red day.

Or is r/stocks more of a swing trade subreddit where people sell as soon as they get 25-100% gains.It is just weird seeing people sell for 25% gains you zoom out and see that same stock is up 300-600% in 5 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:34:36'] The run by the S&P5~~00~~ has been great this year but I think everyone realizes it's mostly been driven by tech. So I was curious to see how much of the gains can be attributed to the big 6 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, GOOG, META). I did a calculation were these 6 tech stocks had 0% gains this year. Based on my calculations (which could be wrong) these 6 stocks alone have contributed approximately 327 points to the S&P500 this year! If these 6 stocks had no gains this year, then the S&P 500 would be at approximately 3823, which interestingly is the same price the S&P 500 was at the beginning of the year (3824). This is all based on yesterday's data and might not have been calculated correctly. In the same time the S&P500 equal weight index was negative YTD (-1.00%) yesterday.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 13:59:32'] Today  I added to BTU, AMR, a micro-cap, and sold some AMD. Commodities are wrecking a lot of people it seems, but it is a risky category. One day I'd like to share the story about this microcap because the amount of incredible DD and the story of how government officials/IR are accidentally leaking very very material information is just so entertaining. If the stock quintuples like there's a reasonable chance of happening, I'll be happy to tell the tale.Why has BTU been so disappointing? They have so much cash, like $1.8B right? That's about half their market cap. Well they completed their surety negotiations (surety referring to the fact that all coal companies have to post collateral for future 'reclamation' of the land) and other debt covenants were cleared. Problem is some $900M is required as collateral going forward, $500M has to be posted as liquidity requirement, and the management is choosing to hold onto another $400M for their own conservative cash management. So suddenly the amount of available cash is not so high. So the buybacks have to come from high FCF going forward, which requires thermal pricing not to melt down. Now I think at today's prices it is a good deal, but... so are other coal names. Had so much cash not been tied up, sure, it would have been an easy double, to $35-40 a share. But the imminent catalyst is really much less exciting. Long term holders will likely see excellent returns in all coal names, but right now, with thermal pricing going down the drain, being optimistic is difficult. At least their small buyback (5-7% of float a quarter?) will be able to suck up even more shares. There are some technicalities about convertible debt but tbh I don't fully understand it. Some credit experts on Twitter are saying BTU is never going to get favorable terms on that to be able to take it out.I'm not adding a lot of BTU, as I have a comfortable sized position--enough that I don't really care if it keeps falling. AMR I have a very large position but at a cost basis I'm very happy with (148). I'm willing to hold AMR for 2-3 years no matter what. I would care if AMR falls another 20% from here though...

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 11:17:50'] How does this ever stop/ pullback? It can't even go more than 50 cents without the V taking it right back up. It seems the real strength is not the extreme rally in QQQ, but the fact that there is a V protecting every drop. Even the days where it's red, it's maybe $2, but the green days are massive. Since  March 13th there has only been 1 day where QQQ fell by more than $5 in a day while today is the 10th day where this is up by $5 or more. I've seen many crazy rallies over the years, but there would always be a pullback/retrace to the mean, but you have '23 where this simply isn't allowed to have normal pullbacks.

Keep moving the date, and we never have to have a debt-ceiling crisis. This is why inflation is going just stick around, and even if earnings go down YOY, they just need to move the goal-post, and market goes higher.

There are still many stuff I cant really understand but I'l guess what I need to do is research and make a plan to diversify my portfolio with risk management."
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 08:45:46'] I like high yield dividend vanguard etfs if you’re just planting your money to sit and walk away.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 08:35:29'] Stocks, even ETFs, aren't "low risk." They're just lower risk than trash stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 10:39:43'] Don’t think big company = low risk. The risk is in the valuation, if it’s trading at a really high multiple, doesn’t matter the company, ur taking on more risk. That’s the issue I see a lot of new investors make these days
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 13:20:32'] 10 years... I'd be looking new emerging market/ tech or so old it can't die. Like 100+ year old companies that know how to survive. Also full shares are the best way to buy stocks. Aside from what others have recommended here's some  ideasStocks: Intel it's cheap at the moment. MSFT, Vale, NGLOY, AMKBY, Shell, Ford, FCEL, HXL, RS, AA, KO... ETFS: BATT, REMX, XDNA, IAUF, MPW, MAIN..10 years allows for a lot of growth or a lot of failure. I wouldn't consider any company with a market cap over 1 trillion safe for 10 years.... Except Microsoft. I dunno something about em.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 18:54:06'] Think about it like this. What do you think people will be using, doing or buying in the next 20 years? That is really a big part of what you are asking. I am betting Microsoft will still be the gold standard for home PCs OS in 30 years so I am investing in that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 10:43:02'] Cut Apple and Google and stick to ETF, etfs are arleady overleveraged on faangs, why would you get in even heavier into fangs? I know people are fanboys about these stocks otherwise they wouldnt be in the top but think for a minute, its wiser to buy a medium cap stock like Sony or Disney for example and mix it with ETF, thats the idea of diversification.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 11:29:35'] I would argue that you aren’t using a low risk strategy. VOO is heavily exposed to AAPL and GOOG as it’s cap weighted. Buying large companies like AAPL and GOOG increases your weight in those companies and your reliance on them to continue to grow. A true lower risk strategy would be buying VOO, a foreign etf, and a small/mid cap etf. Diversification is the key to lower risk. Having said that, if you want low risk just buy bonds. It’ll hurt your expected returns greatly but it’s the only true low risk thing out there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 14:13:44'] Good timing sir. You’re getting everything on sale now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 08:27:42'] Blue chip stocks are by definition more risk adverse so this is a fair play. I would also look into stocks yielding higher dividends so to your point your money isn’t just sitting there.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 13:54:47'] Commodities with a dividend.  Some miners are cheap and have dividend. If tech has solid earnings you will survive. No earnings ? No way. Good luck. I saw this in 99.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 13:56:34'] An index fund that at least tracks the S&P, I personally prefer international exposure also. Individual stock picking itself is pretty risky no matter the company, imo. You might think companies like Apple will be around forever, but I'm sure people thought that about many companies which are now relics. If you're looking for low risk, then an index fund is your best bet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-05 12:29:15'] Food and food inputs. Forget tech for now. Reason: the pandemic created a shift away from services to products as services were limited or closed. This increased demand for products, a lag in supply and combined with government stimulus caused inflation. Prior to the Russian invasion inflation was quite bad and with the invasion our governments are less likely to raise interest rates to slow demand, so prices will continue to increase at the current rate of inflation (stagflation) or increased inflation (hyperinflation). As prices across the board (food, oil, real estate, rent and luxury) increase, which sectors will the lower/middle class allocate their money? My bet is on food and not big tech. Also looking at the technical analysis of big tech you'd be catching a falling knife.

If you can understand and have confidence in the company stick with it imo, and it’s hard to understand many companies so mostly you just end up investing in a few stocks, if you want diversity I say just buy sp500 etfI’ve only started investing last year but because I wanted to put my money to somewhere viable, before even opening up my brokerage account I spent 7 months reading books and researching peoples mistakes etc lol currently I own 4 stocks and it’s been alright.I work and been around computers all my life so I have AAPL, MSFT, GOOG and MU because those companies, I was able to wrap my head around. Other than that I own VOO and VTV, VTV because my portfolio is so tech heavy And VOO is tech heavy aswel so I needed some ETF that covers other defensive sectors Just my 2 cents

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 07:02:11'] Down, they are going down. Nothing has changed to cause the economic environment to somehow recover like nothing happened. If anything IMO the only reason the stocks recovered this much at is because US removed the debt ceiling for the next year and a half, giving them permission to print as much as they can in that time frame.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 04:14:02'] AAPL all time high today. 20,000 % gain in my initial investment 23 years ago. A couple months ago, I transferred a couple hundred shares and started a DAF. I couldn’t stand seeing less shares in my portfolio and rebought the shares, they’ve gone up by 11% since. I can’t seem to bring myself to rebalance year after year. Although it’s worked out am I being dumb?It’s my largest holding by far and it seems to have operated against conventional wisdom. Also, if I sell a bunch, I’m hesitant to be liable for all those taxes at once.  I probably should talk to a financial advisor but before I bought the shares I had a broker who dismissed my ideas including buying apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 04:46:48'] I for one think Nvidia will not be fairly valued until each share costs a bajillion dollars. And if you disagree with me, I think you just aren't able to comprehend AI like I am.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:11:37'] Does anyone even care about a stock that isn't Apple? Or tech? You don't *have* to buy the most well-known company on earth ya know...Anyway CF, a nitrogen fertilizer producer, had a nice day today. Not exactly sure why. I see Dutch TTF (European natural gas prices) are up 20% for July's contract, while BOIL is up 6% in the US. A differential in natural gas prices (an input into nitrogen fertilizer production) would benefit CF as European producers pull back. But lower gas prices are better in absolute terms.Ultimately oil stocks pulled back. A unilateral OPEC cut is going nowhere. Saudi Arabia is not going to single-handedly tighten the entire oil market without the help of the rest of OPEC and Russian compliance. Today's price action won't say much about H2, though. Even the cuts from April took a while to actually hit oil production data: watch the 'cargo loadings' data to see if OPEC exports are falling or not. It takes 1-2 months for oil to ship from S. Arabia to US, for example.Small cap value gave up some of its Friday gains.

Feels like my cash is missing out on these equities rallies, but even with endless QE/MMT it just feels like something could still go wrong to cause a downturn?  Sure seems like they're going to avoid massive problems by printing/spending infinitely (budget is up 40% since 2019 and I don't think they're ever going back to prepandemic spending).

POST_TEXT: b'Really curious to see how this one goes. All big tech have missed so far but obviously went up anyways. The thing I see about MSFT, GOOGL, META is that theyre not consumer driven like Apple and may be somewhat more immune to inflation and recession fears than Apple, which does have services, but are not as big a piece of the pie. \n\nApple is gone up near vertical over the past month in the face of an onslaught of bad news. It sits at a 2.5 trillion market cap. The other aforementioned tech stocks have fallen from their highs but not Apple. In fact, its only about 10% from its ATH, which I think is absolutely insane given all thats happened over the past year and half. \n\nSo what do you think earnings will bring? Will the Apple spree continue even in the face of a miss? Really curious to see your thoughts.'

POST_TEXT: b'Apple dominated the headlines during the Asian session today with reports of the company lowering iPhone production on weaker demand and COVID lockdowns in China causing supply issues. \n\nDespite the strong bounce from its October lows at 134.37, AAPL still underperformed the broader market. With US index futures currently pointing lower, there could be more losses on the cards today. \n\nFridays bounce is an indication of significant amount of demand around these level, and longer-term investors may continue to find shares attractive at the current valuation. However, if todays news is able to fuel a break lower, the stock could have a new low in its sighs given that the next major area of support appears to be at the YTD lows hit in June. \n\nAll trading carries risk, but it will be interesting to see if AAPL looks at risk of a new low this week, or if it can continue to hold support above the October low.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 01:41:21'] My behavior towards Apple drove me to sell the stock awhile back. Before I replace my iPhone with every new model, then I move to every 2 years etc. now I only replace when it goes bad. The increase in price I could not justify replacing a perfectly good phone with the latest.

If Iphone can be ~50:50 in 1st world countries, no reason Macs can't be. * Any other uses of Apple Silicon (AS is so far ahead that they could for example resurrect servers or offer a cloud offering and be competitive if they ever wanted to)* iWork... Desktop Pages/Numbers etc are decent. It wouldn't be that crazy for Apple to start competing more with Google Docs/MS Office.* Phone...they've only saturated 1st world. 3rd world has YEARS of growth ahead.* Gaming...their chips are best in class across the board. Culturally they DON'T understand gaming so they do boneheaded things (like refusing to bundle Arcade with a controller). But it wouldn't be that crazy to envision a world where they wake up and decide to compete.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 11:36:10'] Apple is sitting on a lot of cash so they can also do buy backs if things ever slow. Will it continue on it's trend maybe but will be a constant performer and a good base for a portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:02:53'] Apple's stock has good years and some flat years, but it will continue to grow as time goes on.  It is a good stock to buy when it's at a 2 or 3 month low.  You can also look at ETF's like VGT and QQQ that provide a grouping of stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 17:52:30'] Smart move by Apple is how they are trying to grow services. That way they don't have these cycles with hardware like the iPhone.If you notice the total revenue is growing for services. Like apple music, apple tv, etc. Services are also higher margin.Another thing is if they really make an apple car or someone else makes a car and uses Apple's ip/services. That will make another revenue stream.Apple healthcare maybe a thing in the future as well.Plenty of growth. Also people are mixed on buybacks. Saying it is not real organic growth since they are just sinking the float. But to me that smart. Shrinking the float reduces employee stock options from ballooning the float. Reduces dividends paid out. Increases EPS.Not like the big tech can do big M&A now that Europe and US are on this anti trust/tax.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 19:32:23'] I bought a couple of years back (haven't been investing for long). Despite most people saying at the time that huge companies can't grow much more, I thought it would be a good investment given the company's direction. My investment has roughly doubled and I am happy with that.That being said, you may want to consider that putting your "spare cash" to buy 1 or 2 Apple stocks might not be as worthwhile as directing that money to educating yourself further. Investing in yourself even prior to entering the job market is likely to have a more long-lasting effect on your wealth than 2 Apple stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 16:58:53'] Everyone is focusing in on innovation (of which Apple still does plenty of) but I think the true power of AAPL is the brand itself. It's one of the most powerful and trusted brands in the world.They can literally go into any market and rabid fans will follow them where ever they choose to go. Doesn't matter what the product is. If there's an Apple label on it, people will flock to it.There are only a handful of other name brands that even approach this level of power.So yes, they have plenty of room to grow!

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 14:04:45'] Eh, short term (1-3yrs) I envision a correction. It is at a point where it is a 2.5 trillion dollar company with net profits of a little under 100 billion in the TTM. P/E ratio is historically high at close to 30. However since it is immensely popular the downside isn't extreme. Maybe at most corrects to 1/2 what it's at, at worst before it reaches a floor. Most likely putters around the $150 price point for awhile. Buffett (Berkshire) while narrowing his position to 40% of his portfolio (was 50%) is still a HOLDer. However if he sells off I expect many to follow. Long term I absolutely believe in the company. (5-20 yrs)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 17:58:06'] Apple is continuing to grow its user base at insane rates YoY, it’s gaudy to stupid!They return over $100B to their shareholders annually while still growing this mid to high single digits, and are doing the apple buy the float every 7-10 year pace which means another split in 3 more years. So yes keep buying shares, apple options are so liquid that trading apple is really safe with options. DCA and buy and hold this one! A lot of people hate they missed the finest company to ever invest in.

They just have more existing assets that have yet been fully monetized.It is why Google is up over 4 times more than Apple so far this year (72% vs 16%) and Google should continue to out perform the other four.  But you want to own all five, IMHO.   I actually like Apple second to only Google.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 06:11:10'] Will AAPL grow much more than the NDX, of which it's a principle part, is perhaps a better question.If you can only afford a couple of shares of AAPL you can't be diversified enough. Personally I'd favour an index fund for such a small amount. Ymmv, of course.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 06:50:13'] Dividend growth? Apple pays 0.59% per share. It's hardly a stock you should use for income. Apple is still growing. It grew revenues by 28% last quarter and that's even with the supply and labor shortages that cost them $4 billion in additional revenue.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 12:56:24'] I truly don’t understand all the optimism in these responses. Apple’s stock has been flat since June, and that’s with the launch of new iPhones and incredible Macs. The clowns here will tell you that’s “priced in,” but all I see is a stock with 0 growth for half a year. And I express this negativity as a huge Apple fan typing this very sentiment on an iPad. Great company, awful investment this year.If you’re holding for 30 years, Apple is a solid buy. But if you want faster profits, Microsoft is the way to go.

What I am pretty sure that if you buy the shares because some random person on Reddit told you so; well, when the shit hits the fan and the shares drop a few percent, you will panic and sell it, losing money in the process.The right question you should ask is how to invest with a specific goal and specific time duration. Then maybe then you can ask if Apple is a good business to invest in your context.You are young, time is on your side. Try learning about investing and building wealth properly.

If they already have a monopoly in this sector (outside China) where will the additional growth come from? Ad revenue is the main one but as entrenched as they are it feels like therr are vulnerable points like changes in regulation or technology which makes advertising less valuable etc etc.From my limited understanding they are invested in other sectors too such as AI so what is the expected growth in this sector and what percentage would google take? \n\n\n\nApple - Smartphone giants, smartphones seem like they will always be a huge part of society.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 11:06:45'] Well Google and Apple are two companies that see their services and products consumed at a ferocious rate. Both companies are quite profitable as it stands. AMD fits into your thesis in the sense they make it possible to consume the services (via personal devices) of Google and many many similar products. I am in no way an industry expert but I believe Apple is seeking to be more “chip independent”.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 13:44:42'] Apple and Google are the first and fourth largest companies by market cap.  Almost every equity investor in the world owns them either directly or via ETFs or mutual funds - nothing unique about them being popular here.  AMD is also broadly popular among all equity investors and a top 100 company by market cap. Maybe slightly more hyped here because there’s more gamers on Reddit generally.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-29 14:30:43'] As a millennial I have grown up with Apple products. The computers we had in computer class when we were in elementary school were OG Macs. I’m 28 now and there is no other operating system I am fluent in. ( I work in the entertainment industry) If there is one thing I’m confident in, it’s Apple. That doesn’t mean they will have the best returns in the next 5 years over other companies, but I feel incredibly safe with Apple. I use their phone, iPad mini for work, MacBook Pro, AirPods and Apple Watch. If they had their own home security cameras I would own those too. I am fully enveloped in their eco system and so are most people that I know. I too will continue to buy shares of Apple. It’s a company that I feel I can’t live without and in the end when I cash out, Apple gains will have paid for all of my Apple products.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:36:52'] This is the costliest mistake that retail investors make. You know who benefits from this? All the institutional investors who wait patiently for retail investors to throw in the towel and sell your shares to them at a big discount. There's a reason institutions are referred to as the "smart money".
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:23:04'] 🤦🏼‍♀️ dude….these are blue chips….they will go up once inflation settles. Especially MSFT and AAPL….why didn’t you just hold?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:54:58'] Panic sell at a loss and buy back in at all time highs. This is the reddit way. You've learned well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:36:35'] That was a silly move
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:37:47'] Or you could have just held since there is nothing wrong with the companies and they will bounce back eventually. If anything, you could have averaged down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:53:36'] If you are on margin, makes sense to sell some but if you had a cash account. It was best to keep holding.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:48:34'] Why sell off. You should have added to your positions avg down you had solid companies in your basket. I have all the same except for PayPal but i have been adding on. in 5-10 years these positions will be worth so much more its not like you pton.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:27:45'] that is the C Wood way.buys PLTR at $25. sells at $10. buys SE at $150. sells at $60. sells Apple to buy HOOD and COIN at the IPO. most times, it is just better to hold quality stocks rather than selling for loss and do something else with that money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 09:46:25'] Why tf did you let it fall that much
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:01:29'] I am not a fan of individual stock investing, but the chances of Google, Apple, and Microsoft coming back to previous highs at some point is probably in the 99% zone.  They own 90% of all the market share of OS for computers and cell phones so how would they not eventually retrace? Now will they outperform and index fund over one's lifetime is less likely, but getting back to where they were before is near certain.If I was the OP I would put all of my money in those 3 (since they love tech) or VTI and stop thinking about it.Think it was the great economist Irving Fisher who said (paraphrasing), "It is the duty of the of equity investor to endure losses from time to time and to do it without reproach of their investing plan."  That means you are not doing anything wrong when your stocks are down so don't change you plan it it is otherwise a sound one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:30:47'] Sorry fam but… your growth stocks like Google and Amazon are splitting soon and if you are in for the long haul, bad move. Even more so with your dividend stocks that are still paying dividends through all this “turmoil” like Apple and Microsoft. PayPal was your only solid move, but you should have did that over a year ago.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:38:27'] Ugh. Redemption selling. Only when other's following will the bottom be found. Smart move, it's likely to keep dropping. There is always a level off when people buy the dip, but \*me thinks\* we're in a super bubble that will take a while to pop and at times seem to recover.As with all opinions, it is an opinion, it just happens to be mine.  I think you made the right call. Tech stocks like that are going to be the last thing on the mind of the many people thinking about food and energy. You can always buy back once one redemption selling has been completed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:50:47'] And people doing this is why things continue to drop, causing more people to sell which causes the prices to drop, causing more people to sell which causes the price to drop……
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:54:56'] I don’t know what your cost basis is but in the long run I’m quite sure cashing out of those names will be a bad move for you. You sold while all these names are at deep lows. Now you owe taxes of any gains, plus even if you timed the market perfectly on the way out, you have to time it perfectly on the way back in.

It sounds like people in here are really just projecting their own portfolio’s pain and uncertainty. DCA is only a good strategy until it isnt all tech is in a sort of reckoning right now and all those names are seeing increased regulation anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:22:02'] I agree with your decision unlike most people on that sub. Here's why:Stocks like AAPL used to trade with a PE of 12. It is still trading with a PE of 23. I am not saying it will go to 12, but it might go to 16/17.FED will start the quantitative tightening next month removing 9T of its balance sheet every month. It's gonna be the opposite of printing money. That 9T is just the start, it might be more in the future.Corporate investors are 80% of the market. They now have access to better bonds unlike during Covid. They can have a really good bond giving 5% return with low risk. Those insitutional investors prefer a 5% safe over a risky 15%. So the bond market is now taking investments that was previously in the stock market.I still don't see a crash for the stock market however.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-16 10:36:58'] Look at all these comments laughing at you...

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 13:22:15'] Today I bought AMR and a little more of a micro-cap. I saw a comment about BTU disappointing--totally agree, I'm also disappointed. But I'm also not selling. Coal stocks are highly risky but I'm looking for multibaggers not a little 10-20% return. My initial thesis was that we would immediately see certain steps taken by the company that would lead to a massive re-rating, but instead we found out that they will still keep an enormous sum of cash locked up for the time being (even though they are no longer contractually obligated to). On top of that the broader commodity pricing is deteriorating, with both met and thermal pricing in recession, weak Chinese demand, and extremely cheap natural gas. [That's why AMR + ARCH + CEIX is also trading down, not just BTU for being a shitco-al company] I'm willing to wait for the cycle to turn up again, and I still don't buy recession fears. Hence I buy moar. Regarding met pricing, there are seasonalities causing the underlying commodity price to fall. We exited 'restocking season' in late April, and demand should be weak until monsoon season ends and India picks up the slack. (End of summer) Also keep in mind that there are different qualities of met coal, with the lower quality material coming from Mongolia/China earning a discount to premium Aussie coal, for instance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 10:00:40'] Most bulls think inflation is disappearing soon.  Bears think hyperinflation is coming.I'm a rare bull that thinks moderate inflation is basically here to stay for a while but extremely unlikely to spiral out of control.  Basically Fed will step in periodically to prevent that if needed.  Otherwise they let it just play out.Regardless this post isn't about that.  I learned a very important lesson about gold.  After the Ukraine invasion, I bought a small amount GLD, like $10k at around $185.  Now it didn't actually run THAT much from pre-invasion which was like high 170s so I thought this is a good inflation hedge. Well despite many high surprise prints in CPI after, it just kept going down, down, down.  I bagheld that mfer all the way to $150.Just goes to show A) don't invest in crap that doesn't produce anything and B) more importantly it's impossible to know how much inflation is already priced into it so don't buy it as a hedge for that.  Unlike companies which earnings power can push through inflation, gold cannot do this.Have no idea where it's going from here but I finally got a chance to dump it green at $189 for a miniscule profit and couldn't be happier.  It's a pure gamble as to what goldbugs want.

However, the Fed is facing criticism that it waited too long to pull back and now confronts inflation running at an 8.3% annual pace.>Bernanke said he understands why the Powell-led Fed waited.>“One of the reasons was that they wanted not to shock the market,” he said. “Jay Powell was on my board during the Taper Tantrum in 2013, which was a very unpleasant experience. He wanted to avoid that kind of thing by giving people as much warning as possible. And so that gradualism was one of several reasons why the Fed didn’t respond more quickly to the inflationary pressure in the middle of 2021.”LOL they are buddies.  You really think Jay and Bernanke are going to shit on their intelligent and cautious approach?

POST: ['2021-10-23 12:47:06'] POST TITLE: b'Should I Buy AAPL Shares'
POST_TEXT: b"Hello, I am currently 19yo and I have a surplus of scholarship money that I was hoping to invest. I am a big tech guy and I have been following Apple for a while. Their new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple announcing the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years.\n\nToday, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.\n\nEDIT: Wow this post blew up. Anyways, with earning reports coming later this week, anyone know if AAPL \\*historically\\* tanks or skyrockets after the earning reports are released? Would like some sources and may hold off until purchasing shares after they're released. Also considering my age, I will just dump"

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 13:19:53'] I got in on Apple when the shares dipped to like $112. Haven't regretted it yet.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:36:22'] AAPL and MSFT are both good buy and hold stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 13:32:11'] For a long/medium term l hold, yes. Otherwise just buy S&P500 etf
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:06:43'] Before you burn through your scholarship money on buy and hold stocks, how are you on emergency funds?  Do you have enough money to pay first and last month rent deposits? Pay for unexpected car repairs?  Unexpected medical bills?  Unless you're fortunate enough to have parents who can afford to pay all your bills now and in the short term future, I would think carefully about tying up all your cash as a young unemployed student.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 12:55:21'] Yes. They have solid fundamentals and good management. I would suggest diversifying, even how awesome Apple is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 22:12:06'] Going to mention an angle others haven't, in the US excess scholarship funds are TAXED as normal income. So if you decide to invest it, be sure to save some for tax time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 13:00:58'] My only suggestion is to be patient and not invest all at once. Buy on down day or even better a market correction and save some liquid to buy more when/if it dips lower. I'd do it in 1/3 chunks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:27:53'] Better then a bank account lmao
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 10:14:25'] Yes, you should. Buy and hold, DCA, I have been through a few big ups and big downs on earnings. Buy half ahead and half after if you are worried. Or buy all Monday morning and never look back because in 3 years they’ll split again and you’ll never think about selling. Apple has been an uncomfortably generous portion of the portfolio for some time… uncomfortably for periods of time followed by generous runs after the continuous DCA(dollar cost averaging - monthly buys).Good luck with your venture into the investing world!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 22:52:23'] In the long run, it will not matter if you buy at $145, or if they go down after the earnings and you buy at $135, or if they go up after the earnings and you buy at $155. You’re 19 - if AAPL manages to continue even half its gains over the next 30 years as it saw in the last 30, you will likely be a multi-millionaire if you’re consistent with investment and most importantly NEVER TAKE OUT THE MONEY.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:47:03'] Are you done with school, or is the rest already paid for or at least accounted for? I wouldn’t invest anything unless my expenses were covered.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:08:50'] Buy apple for as long as you can afford to. My only regret in life is not buying more but to be fair I put those funds into tesla and that's done stellar for me for the past 2 years
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 12:57:36'] AAPL always rises
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 06:51:23'] Tech stocks may take a beat this coming week. Be cautious
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 06:51:32'] You won’t regret it as time moves on. Facebook is also in a spot where it could be a good buy. Down from $390 to $320 right now and could go lower. Amazon may be in a good level to buy, especially if it gets closer to $3000 or goes below.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:59:49'] If you’re buying because of the chips, forget about it. Everything is already priced in. If you’re buying because you want a stable company and exposure to blue chips then go for it. My portfolio used to be 60% Apple in the really early stages 😆

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 23:26:37'] I think they're worth 10% of anyone's portfolio honestly. Even if you want to VTI and chill like the boys over at r/bogleheads allocating 20% of your portfolio in individual stocks you like isn't a bad idea.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 00:13:17'] if your investment thesis is based on advice from reddit you probably should not.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 00:35:40'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 06:52:18'] I would put in in AAPL MSFT NVDA GOOGL or maybe just VGT QQQ or something.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 07:29:28'] 50/50 on this for you. Right now with production having issues due to REM, I see it being flat for a while. MSFT is a smart, slow play. Another one that is going to be performing well over the next three quarters is Tesla. But that is my opinion and not a recommendation. Truly what you should do is find some up-and-coming company with a low market cap and see what it does.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 08:10:10'] Apple is a buy buy buy.   Always has been.   As far as buying stocks go it’s one thats  on the safer side
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 08:31:29'] Sure
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 08:55:44'] Aapl historically tanks after earnings reports. Also October is when employees stock vests and some sell during this time
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 09:05:38'] Yes
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 09:07:20'] You don't have to invest $10,000 at once. Just buy 2-3 shares per month for the next decade and diversify the remainder into other (non-tech) stocks or ETFs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 09:51:03'] Yes, buy some AAPL but be diversified and don't feel like you have to keep stocks forever. Remember to clean up/out the non and under producers. Also, the best I've done over the last 5 years is related to buying new stocks when the market and prices are low/down. That and my mutual funds have enabled me to be retired while maintaining a consistent comfortable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 09:52:05'] Epam
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 10:09:25'] MSFT
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 12:06:01'] If you are looking long term, YES. Not sure how much you are looking to invest into the stock, but AAPL is what I would consider a good base portfolio stock. Likely 10, 20, 50 years down the road it will still be a great company and continue to grow.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 12:58:15'] AAPL is a great long hold investment. If you are just starting out with stocks, then at least consider a Tech or SP500 ETF. You will have AAPL but with diversification - which is solid investment insurance. As for when to buy, market timing is almost impossible, imo. The old market saying "It's time in the market, not timing the market which counts." is very true. If you are planning to hold long term, then buying before or after this weeks earnings almost certainly won't make any real difference 5-10 years from now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 17:36:27'] APPL is the safest and best stock to buy.  Doubled after a year or 2
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 23:51:47'] If you can buy in, completely forget about it and check it back in another 10 years then yeah go for it. Another extreme case is buying TSLA
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:24:15'] AAPL isn't the worst company to invest in.I would diversify though. So that if any one position tanks, you don't lose a huge chunk of your s#@&t.I recommend Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Amazon...AMD and Nvidia have a higher ramp for future growth than Apple (imo).
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 20:37:40'] You can never go wrong with Apple. Just remember though “buy high” and “sell low”. This is how you beat the Market long term.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:21:10'] Probably better off investing in an tech ETF that has apple in its holdings, since there is always a chance Apple stops innovating and/or someone comes out with a product that changes the game completely(like the iphone did to the cell industry).....i think in the next 50 years advances in genetic engineering is where most of the growth in tech lies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 23:50:23'] SHIB FTW
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 14:50:35'] Buy TSLA. They are Apple of this generation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 17:05:52'] I will never again own any woke Anti-American company stocks. I sold mine and wish Apple, Facebook, and the others would collapse!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:11:06'] Yes. I’m heavy heavy in aapl. Just ignore the people who say diversity.  If you have a trading plan in place, then a 5, 15, 20% correction will have very little impact on your position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:33:15'] Scholarship money you’ll need for school? You just want some cash? I don’t think appl is going to have a break out. Maybe qyld and just enjoy the income before you need the cash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 17:33:07'] I want to say it’s about as high as it’s ever been and the App Store lawsuit could be a big hit to revenue in the longer term…But I bought AAPL when people said it was too late to buy, and oh wow it wasn’t.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 22:17:28'] Buy TSLA
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 23:02:33'] You could do that. Or you could buy rice and feed it to local wildlife #RiceTips
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 05:50:08'] I don't think I would enter AAPL at this price point. Why not set yourself up with a Roth IRA and buy a diversified, managed fund? Regardless of what you do, I think there are better values out there with more upside potential. Apple has a lot of issues to boot (manufacturing concerns over availability of fab time and labor, work culture in the time of the great resignation, etc).Relevant story here: I was buying precious metals in 2004-5... the dealer I was working with tried to interest me in a platinum eagle coin, but silver was only ~$7/oz and gold was a little over $400... I asked him if he thought the price of platinum would rise as much as gold or silver and he said (and this is why I liked the guy) there was almost no way. Don't be fooled into thinking that a high priced asset is what you should be holding - what you really want is larger percentage growth.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 15:13:17'] Apple is the single best company in the world. If I were forced to buy one stock with all my money - that is where I go. High upside and really safe.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:56:23'] And Nividea
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:51:32'] Buy VEV . Great long term investment!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:35:11'] I majored in global economics and I'd wait for the next crash before buying apple. The longer the inevitable crash is delayed (which has been awhile), the worse the crash will be. Other than that, AAPL has good fundamentals. I don't know if they still have cash stuck in Ireland, but that is one of the few liabilities worth noting in your decision process.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 12:57:51'] Right now apple is really cheap. It has potential for 200 bucks price range.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 14:27:09'] Here is the correct answer to your pondering. Can you think of anything better?? I know a certain digital coin my go to 150 k or might drop to 30k...but people will find out on their I-phones. You sir? Have figured out the future and will inevitably be very successful.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 13:12:21'] No need to. Plenty of exposure to Apple via standard index funds (VOO, QQQM, VTI, etc) so why buy individual shares at all? DCA into VTI and I guarantee you you’ll see better returns over a 1-3 year timeframe than you would going all-in on Apple instead. (If you are really deadset on getting additional exposure to Apple, specifically, as an individual stock, prob cheaper and more effective to just buy LEAPS or long-dated ATM calls on any big red days moving forward).
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 14:43:07'] Hard to say , they basically print $ with how sticky their services are but they are expensive as a company
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 14:44:41'] Now ask yourself “should I breath air?” If your answer is yes. Then yes you should buy APPL.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:16:03'] Does a bear shit in the woods?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:23:10'] You should look and see what’s about to happen in the market. Don’t just invest money because AAPL’s coming out with a cool lens or laptops. What is your strategy? What do you predict AAPL will be at next year, or a few months? Do you want to make money or just invest in AAPL?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:25:02'] Apple is a very good long term investment. If you're going to buy apple, plan on holding shares for at least three years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:26:16'] Always yes.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:26:17'] You've gotten at least a couple of recommendations to dollar-cost average (buy small chunks at a time). You really should look up DCA vs lump-sum and do some reading before you take that advice at face value.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 15:55:41'] Large cap growth companies have a historical and theoretical reason for underperformed the index.  Especially at the current value-growth spread.  I stay away from megacap growth for that reason.  Look up factor based investing for more info.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:04:38'] thanks for the due diligence gonna try buy some more AAPL shares next dip now
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:17:48'] No doubt in the longevity of the company. It’s one of the strongest companies to invest in. Just $ cost average in. Maybe 1000/1500 a month over the span of a year could be a good idea if you think you will hold this money for a minimum of 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:32:02'] Were I you, I'd anchor a portfolio with a broad fund first, like VTI.  Then you've some exposure to most American stocks, weighted by market cap.  That makes AAPL about 5% of your portfolio by default.  Then you can put some money directly into AAPL if you choose, to weight your portfolio more heavily in that direction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 16:40:52'] Yes. When it goes bad no

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 17:27:34'] If you are into tech, look into PLTR, ASTR, LILM, RKLB, SOFI. More room for long term growth.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 18:52:08'] Always
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 19:59:26'] Buy and hold for at least 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 21:23:28'] You want a company that’s a bargain right now and continually moving forward. Paypal. Didn’t have a stellar ER but still very good and on the rumours of buying Pintrist, it dropped but it’s a phenomenal value below $250.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 10:58:55'] I don't own aapl, but I bought some for my kids profile. It's their college money and been in for almost a year now. So far been doing well, so hopefully better in 4 and 8 more years as thats around the time they start college.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-24 21:30:18'] You should buy AAPL, but not because they released M1 chips. You need to understand what their main income is and have to be bullish on future product categories.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 21:49:40'] I wouldn't buy AAPL unless it touched $80, not sure I'd buy it then.Price/Cash Flow around 25, basically multiple metrics around the same values as 2007 that are historically high for the stock.  In addition, declining Shareholder equity trend.  There are better buys to be had.I'd rather buy QQQ (11% APPLE btw) and not bet on one FAANG STOCK.  I see no reason to believe Apple will outperform any of the other FAANG stocks.  I mean, if you had done this so far in 2021, the only one it outperforms is FB over the last 52 weeks, so it didn't give you anything extra.  I much prefer small/medium cap tech stocks that haven't grown as much if I was going to bet on individual stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 10:04:35'] That’s not how it works. The stock price will reflect the buyout price, minus some amount that reflects the risk of the deal falling through and/or the time until deal closing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 10:49:02'] In addition to what others have said, if your strike price is above the acquisition price then your options will immediately go to zero. So you could lose everything even if your speculative thesis is correct.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 10:56:21'] I sincerely doubt Apple would buy a narrowband gen1 LEO operator. For now, the catchup PR value response to T-Mobile’s SpaceX outweighs the cost of the minor addition of an L and S band chipset, and frankly could have been done 5 years ago, but when people realize the satellite capability is basically text messaging and that they have to be outside with a clear sky in all directions to even use that and that it really is an SOS service for backpackers, even the PR value will depreciate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 11:57:29'] That’s not how it works at all.When you have such a lacking understanding of the stock market you shouldn’t be buying options either
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 11:52:06'] Only Redittors are speculating that will happen.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 14:04:25'] I thought there was info that came out with GSATs financing that made it less attractive to AAPL
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 20:35:07'] Lololololololol no, that’s not how it works. *If* Apple were to buy it (why?) they’d probably pay cash because it’s a rounding error for them. But even in a stock deal, you’d end up with like 1 share of Apple for every 80 or so shares of GSAT you had pre acquisition (or whatever purchase price they negotiate).
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-11 22:09:43'] Too much hype on GSAT. It's a niche safety feature for a very small portion of the userbase.AAPL owns warrants to purchase shares at ~$1.01/share, a large discount to the current price.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 22:09:04'] Buying the biggest companies in the world has historically not been a winning strategy over the long term, no matter how impenetrable their moats are at the moment. (I'm sure someone will share that graphic of the top market cap companies over time) The amount of runway for $1T, $2T companies just doesn't compare to what is possible with $500M, $10B market cap companies. I don't want to just buy the past winners, but buy the future ones. This is why the core strategy of my portfolio are large tilts to small cap (value) stocks, which is both riskier but also has higher rewards in the long run. They are also a hedge when big tech hits a wall, like happened post-Dot Com. [Take a look at 2000-1](https://i.imgur.com/xIpUKyL.png) in this table of small cap value versus the broader market in down years.I like buying big tech 'tactically', as they do have rock solid balance sheets and moats, so when they do dip (irrationally), I buy them. This rewarded me greatly in 2022, as I doubled down on - GOOG (+25%, 2% of port.)- META (+60%, 2.6% of port.)- MSFT (+17%, 2.8% of port.)- AAPL (+19%, 1.9% of port.)- SMH (+24%, 1.4% of port)- AMD (+12%, 2.5% of port.)Yes I didn't time the bottom perfectly or I'd be much richer. I had opened up positions on these in 2021-2, and either averaged down from expensive levels or bought when I felt was too cheap. AMD/MSFT were among my worst timed purchases. But these are not necessarily long term holds since I already have exposure through index funds and I think they are fairly to over-valued now.

POST_TEXT: b"I was taking a closer look at AAPL since the Bloomberg article and I noticed that their valuation pre-pandemic was ~$80 and they now sit at ~$150. I did a little surface level research but I can't find anything immediately obvious that would justify roughly doubling their valuation in this time period.\n\nSome tech catered to the shifting economy (e.g. WFH), and it's understandable why they took off from 2020.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 21:27:58'] In that time their revenue increased 40%, gross profit increased 50% and FCF nearly doubled, a good amount of which was returned to shareholders.

Reason for this is frankly pretty depressing - debt is possibly at a point of no return, politics getting more and more problematic, and likely either party will only increase debt, 500 basis point increase in fed rate after a decade of almost 0 rate has consequences that haven’t even been revealed, social security will be an issue pretty soon (Stanley druckenmiller predicts sometime 2025-2035, my vote on it being earlier than later), de-globalization and de-dollarization has only just started. Those are just the things at the top of my mind, I could come up with more. Btw I have never once held gold anytime before so I’m not a long term gold bull just trying to sell the idea. I’ve only just recently started a position in this asset class. Some would say in this case you should get bitcoin instead but i personally have doubt about bitcoin and would rather go with gold that has historically proven itself.

There's risks, but they are on the verge of  solving a lot their operational expense problems (livestock management, feed sourcing, labor cost). Given their relative historical valuation, they're a good option to pickup for the long term

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 02:04:27'] While your end conclusion might be right, this analysis is unfortunately very flawed.First of all, they have been buying back a lot of shares. I mean tens of billions worth of stock every year. This means that every share outstanding now owns a larger part of the company's revenue and earnings. So while you are analyzing the growth of total revenue, you should be looking at the growth of revenue per share and earnings per share. That is, if you are comparing revenues to Apple's stock price.Secondly, not every $ sold is valued the same. As an owner of a company you shouldn't focus solely on the top line *(=Revenue)* but rather on what's left for you once everything is paid *(=Net Income/FCF depending on your angle)*. In Apple's case, the revenue stream that is growing the fastest is Services. And because their gross margins on Services is somewhere around 70% while it is around 35% for Products, every Service revenue $ is double as valuable (compared to Products). This is the same phenomenon we are seeing with Amazon and their AWS cloud segment which is highly more profitable than the E-Commerce side.There are naturally other factors in play, such as interest rates (*desperate need to find returns on this newly available piles of cash causing multiple expansion*), politics (*Right-to-repair & limiting the power of Tech giants*) but I haven't investigated Apple deeply enough to chip in on those issues.In conclusion, Apple (along with other tech giants) have witnessed huge multiple (P/S, P/E etc.) expansions during the last few years and could very easily be overvalued. However, a simple analysis of a company top line doesn't tell us anything of value.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 01:14:45'] In the short term weak Chinese economy and further chip shortages could be problems. In the long term, my biggest fear is that the Apple Car is going to suck. Right now we're hearing pretty bad news about the car -- the guy in charge isn't even a car guy, and they are losing talent to other companies. But I'm still long on Apple because I believe there's a huge synergy in cloud, edge, wearables, AI, and health care. Apple Watch will continue to gain functionality to the extent that it could replace some doctor's visits. But the Apple Car problem does keep me up at night.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 03:46:44'] While I understand your side of the argument, one thing you seem to assume is the product portfolio is constant.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 03:31:15'] It's certainly an interesting theory, and probably true to some extent. However, my thoughts:1) The transition from Intel-based Macs to M1 is still mid-way through. There's still the 27" iMac replacement due as well as the top-end Mac Pro. There's a ton of people holding out for these. Self-employed designers and filmmakers, right up to small and mid-sized studios who probably last updated to the 2018 iMac Pro.2) Going on from that, there's still barely enough stock to meet demand of the newly released 14" and 16" MBP which are absolute game-changers for the company. Once supply chain issues are worked out, these will sell like hot cakes.3) Potential new product categories - though they may not launch this year, any announcement of AR Glasses or a Car will bound to create a ton of buzz around the company and drive interest.4) A ton of apps are dropping support for iOS 12, including mammoths like WhatsApp, Netflix etc. The iPhone 6 is locked to iOS 12, and a huge amount of people are still rocking those. They're now feeling pressured to update to a new iPhone to continue using their favourite apps.I think the 2020 surge of sales was definitely beneficial, but mostly for the MBA and MBP and mid-range iPads. Stuff that sells itself anyway.

I get 10+hr battery life from a base MacBook air. It never gets hot even without fan. This also allowed for apple to reduce the prices.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 05:45:09'] People have been saying they are overvalued for a decade and yet they still out perform every year almost. I’m not betting against them. Especially while they continue to dive into the health tech sector and have an EV reportedly coming in 2025, all while having a TON of cash and great margins. I’ll be buying more this year per usual.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 06:21:56'] I think the real concern about Apple's valuation isn't what revenue or profit growth they've experienced in the last few years, it's the reasons why the market has given Apple a higher valuation.In short, a lot of hype over products that are at least a few years out (at a minimum) from entering the market have driven their stock price up. The Apple car being the biggest example of this, but Apple VR/glasses hype has also driven up the stock price. There's major risks with both of these projects that aren't being acknowledged by the market. People are just assuming that because it's Apple of course they can make a car or a robotaxi work, or of course people will want to buy smartglasses from them even though Google Glasses failed miserably in the market despite all the hype before it was released.Whenever the EV bubble pops Apple is almost certainly going to see a big drop in share price because of this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 07:24:48'] Great Explanation. I can't say it any better. I agree with you fully
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 07:46:48'] The free cash flow yeild for apple is pretty good tho with 3.6%
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 08:14:54'] I agree. 2020 and 2021 we can all agree is an anomaly, not just for Apple. Apple has historically been a mid single digit growth company. Their primary markets long ago reached saturation. I’m expecting Apple to return to mid single digit growth, and multiple compression back down to the mid teens. Which is in line with what you would expect to pay for slow growth, and Apple pre-2019 when rapid multiple expansion started.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 10:32:18'] "our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH".Great post and I agree.  Year 2022 may still be great (and not CRUSH) for Apple when they will announcing some new products (metaverse related, autonomous driving, and/or more health wearable products).APPL is my top holding (#1 and being a long term investor of APPL) so naturally, I want APPL shares to be up and up overtime.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 16:27:48'] That dent in the Chinese market is no accident
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 16:11:29'] Bearish on AAPL as well. There’s a 4 day inventory for semiconductors right now that’s going to wreck AAPL if there’s a distribution supply issue. There’s no room for error. Sure, they may have inventory sitting in storages for now, but is it enough to supply projected sales? No. October 2021 showed their vulnerability when they lost $6B in revenue due to chip shortage. 52% of net sales are iPhones alone. I’m not going to think there’s enough in WIP Inventory to supply what they need eventually. They probably estimated the inventory life for semis at like 24+ days.Plus, if and when Taiwan gets invaded, US is probably going to sanction off trade to China and given that China represents 10% of current customer segment, that’s a blow.Their stocks are overvalued - doesn’t make sense how they can all of a sudden gets so hyper overinflated between the periods you pointed out. They got money pumped in so hard and now it’s holding high at its current inflation. I expect declines in AAPL and it’ll feel the impact of the market correction of this and next year. If China conflict happens (maybe after Beijing Olympics), it’s going to drop even more.No thanks
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 00:23:39'] No one should hold AAPL outside of an index ETF. All the exposure you’ll ever need.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 20:28:53'] It's going to correct alright.  But before it corrects down 10%,  it may run up to another 15% first.It's best is to leave them alone and save cash (from a W2 job) on the side for a possible correction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:42:29'] I definitely wouldnt sell out of the positions. Both are wonderful companies. However it never hurts to take some profits especially as valuations get out of control. Take some gains and let the rest ride.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:50:19'] My basis in AAPL is something like $6 a share. If I applied this logic I would not be up 2400% or whatever it is now after holding for twelve years through several splits. This is not a company you liquidate. Sell shares if you need the cash, otherwise just hold indefinitely.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:53:45'] MSFT and AAPL are lifetime holds. If there is a correction buy more, pause and buy more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:48:56'] In the same is boat with my apple shares up 40%. However I just sold out of AMD and NVDA because I was up about 25 and 35 % on those positions and look what happened today. Trying to not be greedy cause I got screwed with SE. I know it’s not the same but I wanna make money not loose it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 21:55:06'] Let me tell you a story, a year ago when apple was 120€ and correction was "just around the corner" and crash is happening I didn't buy apple waiting for it. Point of the story is, if I had done the right thing I would be +50%, but instead I'm at about 0% average on the stocks I bought. Don't sell apple, 10% correction is nothing to it, there are millions of idiots like me waiting for it, if the -10% happens it will be very short lived and I would not bet that you will get it at that.Apple should be super long, let it run, they have plenty to go, I would consider selling once they start going sideways for a long time (years).
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 20:16:56'] For what it’s worth I thought the same about NVDA and cashed out in June, I’ve been waiting ever since. If you are comfortable with your gains now and don’t mind missing out on a further uptrend, there’s nothing wrong with selling.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 08:32:59'] Don't touch Apple and MSFT. My average cost for Apple is 93 dollars,  I just add whenever price drops. Companies like Apple and MSFT are for life.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 01:22:17'] Just keep them, don't try to time for a potential dip that might or might not be coming, it's not worth the risk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:57:14'] If you want to be in these companies for the long haul but want to take profits the smart play is to sell a small portion of your stock say 25%
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:39:23'] Sell 25%.  Taking money off the table is always a good thing.  Don’t be too greedy… pigs get slaughtered!
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 20:10:33'] I trimmed apple before the post earnings dip last quarter. I waited for it to dip more and it never came. Now it’s way beyond where I should have bought back in. Timing the market is a fools errand. Just hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 21:05:23'] If you think it’s going down sell some CCs against a portion of your shares, if it drops you made money but keep your shares, if it rises you can roll them for profit. If it rises too high to roll then you’re in the same boat you would have been if you’d just sold
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 22:34:16'] Tom Lee thinks faang will outperform in 2022. He thinks there will be a 10% spy correction early in the year but he’s never drawn direct correlation with it to mega caps. It’s also hard to wrap your head around what such a thing could look like. For example if spy rallies 20% in q1 and then drops 10% in q2 and then rallies 20% in q3, how bad do you feel about that 10% correction in the middle of an overall 30% gain in the market? As for your allocation I wouldn’t worry about such small percentage allocations. I’d say you’re fine. If you’re long stocks then it’s pretty much all the same result and results improve as long as you stick to the high liquidity. Spy and faangs plus Tsla and Nvda are the most liquid trading products in the world. More money goes through those on a daily basis than anything else. Makes it a lot harder to get investing wrong if the entire financial market is in on the action. Really easy to get burned when no money is flowing in something by contrast. Something to think about for ya.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-03 19:46:31'] I've no idea how AAPL has gone on the ride it has in the last month or so.  The expected earnings don't justify it... most fair value estimates are <$120.  The 'I-Car' has been rumored for years now and there's really no solid info on when it will happen or even what it is.  The AR/VR thing seems more promising in the near term - but knowing AAPL if they have it in the works but they are unable to make it more than just a gimmick... they won't release it until they can.  AAPL isn't into being ahead of the curve, they focus on making the stuff that already works better.Don't get me wrong, I own AAPL.  But the current price is something I'd expect mid-2022 or later if all things work in their favor.  Don't know if the price will drop with any significance - but this to me seems bordering on 'irrational-exuberance'.

I hold ARKK in my IRAs, and max mine the beginning of the last year, it fell by 25% through the year, now I max my for 2022, it average down to 15%. So understand your own strategy is the key. To hold until you have substantial gain, even after tax. Otherwise it is meaningless.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 05:48:31'] If you can, the best way to rebalance is with new money. Add new money to other things.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 07:16:58'] Timing the market will hurt you in the long run. The main problem is the taxes you pay on the gains. If you buy a stock at $100 and sell at $200, you would pay $15 in capital gains or more if ordinary income. So you'd have to be confident that the price will come down to at least $185 or below to come out ahead. Unless the stock drops below $180 or more, the risk of missing out on bigger gains isn't really worth it to me. This is true especially with solid companies like AAPL or MSFT that just grow over time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 08:16:39'] If your plan is to just buy back in a few months I would just hold unless you absolutely need the cash immediately.

Some Nasdaq100 and S&P 500 are overpriced today ... might need more then 10%.   If  market hit 10% and looked like a bottom, I would look for stocks that were hit hard, maybe 20% down, and which  don't look like value traps.   It's not so much the drop but why the drop that is important.

There are other stocks trading at less than their cash value (many SPACs), so wouldn't expect those to fall.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 16:35:25'] Investing in stocks requires careful consideration of various factors, including an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance, investment goals, and thorough research.    In the event of a market decline, investors often look for opportunities to buy stocks that they believe are undervalued or have strong long-term potential. However, the choice of a specific stock to buy during a market drop would depend on individual investment strategies and preferences.    It's important to conduct thorough research, analyze the fundamentals of a company, consider its industry outlook, and assess other relevant factors before making any investment decisions. Consulting with a financial advisor or investment professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances is highly recommended.    Remember, investing in stocks involves risks, and it's important to make informed decisions based on your own analysis and understanding of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 19:35:53'] This might be stupid but let's see. Is there anyway to know how much money was invested in stocks last year during the downturn compared to now. It seems everyone is hoarding cash or parked in treasuries/money market funds waiting for the next crash whereas last year this wouldn't have been the case with the lower yields. I don't see how we can have any sort of meaningful crash when there is so much money on the sidelines waiting. Are people really waiting for SP 3300-3500 to jump back in. It seems any dips we have from here will have so much buying pressure with all the cash waiting on the sidelines. At what point do people start fomoing when the market is dropping.Cramer is even saying to keep some cash and wait for a drop from the debt ceiling. If everyone is doing the same thing is it really going to happen?It seems like if this debt ceiling gets resolved and the FDIC came out and stopped short selling against banks or guaranteed deposits this market could take off. With so much money on the sidelines I could see a massive fomo rally.

POST: ['2022-02-21 18:27:46'] POST TITLE: b"6 reasons why AAPL isn't a pandemic stock"
POST_TEXT: b"**tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.\n\nIt makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.\n\nAAPL is still up \\~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?\n\nHere are my 6 reasons:\n\n* **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.\n* **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic\n"
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 18:51:44'] Agreed except for the car. Apple does consumer electronics and software very very well, but cars are a whole different animal. The insane amount of testing, regulation just to validate a compliant car design is on an entirely different level. Apple has never had to worry about human safety in a high speed crash event before. As a former Ford engineer, I can tell you its a pain in the ass and not very profitable even in the best of economies. I think theres a better chance they cancel the project rather than bring it to market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 18:57:54'] Apple will be one of the last to get taken down as the market corrects to its mean.  When institutional money managers suffer losses buying PLTR or PTON or some other profitless junk then it's hard to escape blame.  When they go down holding AAPL then they cannot be blamed because the market took down even the most solid of stocks.  Few will question why they thought it was a good idea to hold a stock that had gained an unbelievable two trillion dollars in a couple of years.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 19:04:31'] My question, however, is why has AAPL done so much better than MSFT this year? Both seem to be very strong companies, but MSFT has been quite stagnant for a while now even on fantastic earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 19:50:30'] If you own AAPL - This is post is going to have wonderful confirmation bias.  But remember that no stock is fool-proof.  Both GOOG & MSFT aren't sitting back and letting AAPL run.  That competition is likely to gain momentum over the next year +.(GOOG - Currently much improved Pixel hardware & sales... and industry leading AI that in the near future could be game changing)(MSFT - Moving to free OS upgrades on supported hardware. Much improved Surface offerings & service offerings)Full disclosure - I own AAPL stock.  I have an iPhone 12.  But my go to 'PC' hardware is hands down Windows based - I love my $700 Surface.  And if GOOG keeps making better phone software I could easily see in the future transitioning to Android - this after having been loyal to AAPL since my iPhone 4.Not saying OP's wrong.  Just remember the perils group-think.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 18:53:49'] Huawei would affect Samsung sales more than it would affect Apples, especially with the SE models being an affordable entry phone into the ecosystem.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-22 06:14:33'] >Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying "Apple products are overpriced" is no longer trueYeah it is. Where do you think their profit margins come from? They're the definition of "overpriced".Then there's bullshit like the 999$ Pro Monitor stand, 19$ Cloth and other overpriced nick-nacks.You buy a PC to have it configurable and easy to evolve. A MAC is bought once then dumped after its lifecycle is over.Yeah they might have cheaper stuff now but for those prices you can easily buy something much more powerful. Last time I upgraded my phone I did look at the iPhone SE and I ended up choosing an android from Motorola anyway - had much bigger capacity, screen, better sound and was faster. For all things audio there's nothing that is better than sony. Apple's earbuds took off because of branding - like much else they have - celebs were seen wearing them and they were easy to identify regardless of sports regulations forbidding their advertisement.M1 is legit a great improvement but it has a few catches: - programs have to be recompiled so they'll work on the new architecture.- industry will catch up to it eventually - a time benefit for apple but a cost benefit for everyone else as Apple's R&D spending and gearing up for production balanced it out- Apple is a pure garbage company when it comes to developers for their platforms: an increasing number of applications were "stolen" i.e. copied of ideas and deployed by them without their extra appstore fee they charge everyone else + they'll use stuff like privacy or other seemingly good topics to push against competition for ad revenue or any other sources of revenue. how long will they keep it up until devs get fed up with it and see themselves as targets & guinea pigs? microsoft got slapped for one big case like this in the 90s, Apple so far is staying clear but a reckoning will arrive.I've been involved with IT all my life and while I commend Apple for their achievements I wouldn't buy any of their products if I can help it - and fortunately for now I can. Microsoft or other industry players copying some of Apple's choices just piss me off on the regular - i hate the hamburger menu dumb-down ui, the constant push of form over function from the boxes and designs and they definitely shot themselves in the foot with the windows 11 look.They're a good stock to own tho, for now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-22 11:44:37'] Also…Apple does absolutely MASSIVE stock buybacks. On buybacks alone, it has concentrated earnings a great deal. Apple has spent more than $467 billion in the past 10 years on buybacks. In fact, since August 2018, when Apple first hit a $1 trillion value, its stock is up 252%, compared with a market cap increase of about 200%. The disparity is a direct result of its buyback program, which has reduced the company's share count from about 19.4 billion at the end of June 2018 to about 16.4 billion now.Why more cash-flow rich companies don’t do this is beyond me.

If you bought the day after earnings then you were late to the game and buying the news. That said it'll be gaining plenty leading up to July assuming the market generally trends upwards and I'd expect more movement post split then pre
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 16:55:36'] Google is already up 6% and it was less than a week ago we found out about the split.I would expect Google share price to continue to appreciate faster than the overall market going in to the split.The split will mean Google can join the DJIA which is a nice tailwind.But just overall Google is just killing and you want to own.I thought Apple had a great quarter. Google put up over 3 times the growth rate of Apple!!out of all the FANGs you have Google growing by far the fastest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow.Google still has tons of assets that the have yet to monetize or fully monetized.Take Android. Over a billion devices activated per year and Google does not charge a cent. They could do a nominal license fee of $10 and add over $10 billion of revenue which really would be profit as it would not add any new expense.But Android is just one example. Google has so many others which just make a massive runway for Google. So if growth starts to slow Google has plenty of levers to pull to keep it going for a very long time. Plus Google keeps adding new ones.People forget that Google is half the age of Microsoft and Apple. It is only a matter of time until Google passes Apple. They already blew past Microsoft. Google has more revenue and makes a lot more than Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook or Netflix. FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.Google is also going to do a 20:1 stock split which means they can now join the DJIA. Probably replacing IBM but it could be CSCO (Cisco). That will also give an additional strong tailwind.But the other thing really going for Google is the financial engineering. Google bought back over $50 billion in their own shares in 2021. That means less outstanding shares which then just increases EPS as there are less shares.Google had over $65 billion in free cash flow in 2021. They also have over $140 billion in cash just doing basically nothing. Google could really increase their buyback and that significantly decreases shares. So share price appreciations with Google basically doing nothing. Why they call it financial engineering.BTW, in the past people would say there is this law of large numbers. Which was such a croc. It was the reason given for Apple growth slowing. Well Google has finally put that to rest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow. They are now an over $250 billion dollar business. Will be well over $300 billion next year.I am old but I have never seen a more amazing company. The fastest in history to get to 1 trillion market cap. Then the fastest to $2 trillion. Amazon is actually three years older than Google and why the records are with Google.People think Google genius is with their technology. But actually the most genius thing they did was using the dutch auction for search. That was just brilliant. It will also help them with the government as Google does not set price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:03:56'] There will be a run up Google but much closer to July when the split happens.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:29:36'] Google has NEVER traded the way that Tesla has and thinking that it will is a mistake. It can move in a big way, but a big move for it is more like jumping 30% over a time period of a few months, and Tesla has pulled 50%+ in a month.If the worst of it is over for the Nasdaq, this can trade $3300-3500 by July. I'd be really surprised if it was more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:37:59'] Plenty of time before July. People are waiting to see what happens after rate hikes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 11:39:06'] I think the wait for the google split has a lot to do with it. AAPL and NVDA both split within 4-5 weeks of the announcement, GOOG on the other hand won’t split for another 5 months. It’s pre split run up should start mid June, possibly sooner. I feel your pain though, grabbed some shares as well after the announcement and am down. It’ll recover though and a great long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 13:15:13'] We're those splits occurring when the market trend was bullish? Because the trend right now is bearish, with signs of it possibly going either way. People might be hesitant. All those other stocks also weren't 3k prior to split?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 18:04:33'] My guess is AAPL, TSLA, and NVDA announced their splits during a raging bull market, and GOOGL announced it during a downtrend.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:50:40'] GOOG/GOOGL is an almost 2T market cap stock. You arent going to get 50% or more run up to a split. Too big of a market cap for that kind of move.Also it is two stocks while stuff like TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, CRM were just one stock to focus on and pump.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 18:23:43'] First, Google already went up earning, and it holds up better than the market currently. It's a giant company so you need BIG big money to move the stock.Second, we are in a different market environment. Sentiment changes and right now the market worries about a lot of things. If Google has done this last year, maybe you would've a similar run like others that have done splits. The market doesn't have a big appetize for speculative plays right now. It values stocks where they're deserved, and punish those severely that don't put up good results.You made a risky gamble and assumed everything should follow precedents when we are in a different mood. This is what happen after a market euphoria. Retail traders thought they were making easy money and thinking this could go on forever. A lot of people got destroyed speculating on garbage small caps suggested in this sub. Unfortunately, you may have to go through one too, to learn that timing the market, especially using risky strategy like buying OTM option, will cost you dearly when you're wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:50:03'] $AAPL & $GOOGL are great to hold , $TSLA is a bet on Elon Musk, $NVDA is a dominant chip company and a much better value thankfully but it’s unknown to me if they are investing enough , $CRM is a stock I like but it’s a question if they can maintain or grow market share
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 02:39:30'] I don't get it why people are afraid that in a recession a monopoly like Google will be affected more than it's market. Guys, when things go bad you cant afford looking for scraps to spend the (cut) marketing budget, you go for what you know it works. Google will bounce up when the market calms down in volatility, probably after the first rate hike. I can tell you when th going gets tough the marketing spend is the first to take a hit, no more events, sponsorship and so on. You have to stick to the basics and google is as basic as you can go.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:43:03'] A better question would be: why would a stock go parabolic after a split?  The answer to that is either the stock action had nothing to do with the split or people are stupid.  If the action had nothing to do with the split, then your question is answered.  If the answer is people are stupid, then what we can see is stupid people dump more money in the market when everything is going up than when they are getting burned by their other stupid speculative trades (see all the hot tech companies that are down 50+% right now).

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 21:16:08'] I would roll out of those calls before THETA takes you to the house of pain.I saw you bought 3600 2023 calls. Depending on what you paid  based on what I saw today for the jan it needs to move 900 bucks to break even. Considering it just touched or came damn close to intraday ATH and we were in a what is will be a volatile time after a record run up...It's not impossible, but I'd roll out of the shares at a reasonable opportunity over the next month
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:05:41'] At a 20:1 split many retail customers can’t even afford a few shares so will probably wait till closer to the split or the split if it doesn’t start rising.Also big money can’t even move the stock too much because of the price. It’s easier for big money to drop their stake in a more expensive stock temporarily and buy lots of shares of a lower priced one than the other way around.Lastly .. you can never look at what another stock did as a guideline to what a current stock will do.There is too much reverse psychology and misdirection going on.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 04:31:27'] Whelp general consensus is people are much much hesitant this year and waiting for Fed Ted talks to guide their investments.I would say IV will continue to spike hard last few weeks before split and then spike even harder post split.  That should accommodate OTM calls because let's face it, no one can afford ITM calls right now. I plan to buy one huge Jan 2024 when the next Fed Ted talks go through to see where the sentiment is, then throwdown on it and let it ride.  If it spikes like crazy presplit and post split, I'll probably sell.  If not, theta will guide my way through whatever the hell is gonna happen this year

The other fields are trillion dollar industries each (except satellite internet I believe) and amazon has a good shot of nailing a few of those and that’s all they would need. As an investor amazon has the potential to print so much free cash flow by end of this decade alone that it’s worth jumping in now, it’s a risk but better odds then most risks imo.

Share price is low enough that I can actually get 100 shares easily and then sell a covered call on that. If you are willing to sell a long dated contract you can do fairly well on the premium collected. Just as an example Jan 2024 $15 strike price for .87 per share. Price currently 12.74 and dividend is .15 per quarter. So 3 dividends for .45 plus the  .87 premium is over a 10% gain right there. Tack on if the call is actually exercised and you are look at another 2.26 per share all in less than a year. That isnt something to sneeze at.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 18:20:40'] Lately it is $AMR. They are a US-based producer of metallurgical (abbreviated 'met') coal that exports to over 25 countries. Met coal is a key input used for steel production--don't get confused with thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity and whose use is generally more controversial.The company is highly undervalued, even for a cyclical coal mining company. It is in the process of reducing its share count by about 30%. To quote some statistics from mid-March: "It has a market cap of 2.6B and has 300M in net cash. Its 2022 FCF was $1.3B. They have $1.2B remaining in share buybacks authorized, having already done $560M in buybacks since first authorization (beginning 2022 I believe). I'm seeing FCF/EV yields of 30-40%." [Read that once more: it generated half its entire market cap in FCF last year]It's roughly fairly priced if met coal prices were at $200 a ton, which is the average from 2010-2020. However, actual met prices are currently much higher thanks to surging demand from India/China, as well as bullish sentiment about steel usage in the US thanks to recent fiscal stimulus. [By contrast, thermal coal prices have less of a runway ahead of them barring a terribly cold winter in 2023/4]. We can't replace met coal just yet to produce steel, unlike thermal coal for power generation. Thermal coal can be phased out provided we make the right investments in nuclear/solar/wind/geothermal/hydro/natural gas/crude oil/..., all of which are better for the environment than thermal coal. I believe scientists are still experimenting ways to find cleaner ways of producing steel, like using hydrogen or other new materials. But that's a few decades away.2023 hasn't posed much of a slowdown at all for AMR, and it locks in contracts at great prices well in advance. Management has made clear they have *no* plans of expansion or M&A and are focused on share buybacks.I own shares at $153 a share, and it's roughly 1.5% of my portfolio (and will likely become close to 2%). I've been slowly buying in since January of this year.A similar company to AMR is ARCH, which is also met coal + thermal coal, or CEIX. (BTU is another company I'm excited about but it's a much riskier play than AMR. I'm equally bullish on AMR/BTU and can say more if people want)

The market panic of an expected recession by the end of 2022 and it's main competitor Dicks Sporting Goods DKS lowering guidance crushed the stock bringing its forward PE down to 3X and PS to .25 or something. I mean, the valuation was totally crushed at that time bringing the market cap to just ~1B or something and even if expected sales and profit was going to be low, you could still give it a forward guidance of 4x or 5x as historical PE in the sector is between 9 &14. I was pumped to buy it with a margin of safety and just hold it forever and buy every dip and waiting for the recovery. The way the stock acted since then is like "what recession?".Edit: Academy not American

I didn't honestly believe it would get to $30 so I held myself to that and pulled the trigger.I'll continue holding for the next 2 cycles (2029) to try and prove my theory that they have $200b MC potential, and whether I win or lose, I'm OK with it because I believe in this industry as a whole and it would feel great to prove Jim Cramer wrong.There's huge upside with the right scenario playing out, and massive downside if it doesn't.I'm well aware of the regulatory hurdles, and I'm definitely biased as I used to work with the CEO before he left to start CB, but I have faith if anyone can build a startup into the #1 digital asset exchange in the world, it would be him and his team.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 19:53:52'] MDT - Medtronic. Hold for at least 10 years. Their ROIC took a huge hit (12% to 5-6% over the last 6 years) with the 2016 Covidien acquisition, but they're in the midst of a restructuring. They're not a stock to buy and sell in 3-5 years, but they would be a great buy not only in terms of storing value, but they can only go up over the long term. They are extremely well-positioned to take advantage of the AI revolution in the area of robotic surgery, and their moat is extremely wide. They are on the cutting edge of innovation in everything they do and over the long term, since their products are so vital to enjoyment of life and lengthening of life, they are sure to only grow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 09:03:23'] Speaking anecdotally, but our company has been cost cutting in 22’Q4 and 23’Q1 via lay offs and between Q1 and Q2. We have reduced spending on orders in anticipation of lower demand (with a noticeable difference in Q2 - our purchases for raw materials has been down nearly 30% from Q1). I won’t comment on the industry I work in, but our main customers are large publicly traded companies in the SP500. Not to sound doom and gloom, but I believe Q2 earnings will take a hit despite a good outlook from companies on its current Q1 reports. I anticipate a recovery would be in the late ‘23 leading into ‘24.

The only bearish case I see for stocks on this sub is P/E too high and they miss out on great compaines try to short it and get blown out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 05:34:55'] The Fed punching air right now as 250,000 new jobs were added, more than the 180,000 that were expected. They cannot even engineer a recession in this resilient market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 06:01:28'] WBD looks to have hit the pivot point, even if some of these figures are hard to swallow (like taking on an additional 1.5 billion in debt). Streaming guided up is pretty bonkers, and overall it looks like the tanker is being slowly but surely steered in the right path. I am not a fan of going in the red on FCF, but the business should weather.The WGA strike is important, and also short term noise as a shareholder. I hope the studios make the right concessions that help writers to end the strike quickly. Seeing how many items were struck down by studios in pre-strike discussions was upsetting.Gaming is the ace in the hole, and that content stream will lean on Gotham Knights & Mortal Kombat 12. That additional cash should flow nicely in the second half of year earnings.Still going to hold as the thesis has not changed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 11:57:58'] The irony is that we're up because of the job report (i.e. no recession, or "mild" recession), but it also means that the Fed will go higher for longer, which isn't good for equities.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 13:53:46'] ### Atlanta GDP Now: 2.7% for Q2> The GDPNow model estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the second quarter of 2023 is **2.7 percent** **on May 4**, **up from 1.8 percent on May 1**. After recent releases from the US Census Bureau, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Institute for Supply Management, the nowcasts of second-quarter real personal consumption expenditures growth and second-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth increased from 1.3 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, to 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, while the nowcast of the contribution of the change in real net exports to second-quarter real GDP growth decreased from 0.38 percentage points to 0.31 percentage points.It's true jobs got revised down in the earlier parts of the quarter. I'm not sure how much that matters for forward-looking stocks. Market is not going to care if Q1 gets revised down to 0.5% growth or something, and Q2 comes in strong. In any case, even if jobs growth slowed down in February/March, the unemployment rate *decreased* and wages came in hot, so it didn't appear to have much of an impact.----Irrelevant portfolio comments: Nice strong day. Coal names benefited from the rising market, with AMR rising nearly 6% and wiping out my losses. Very excited for Monday's earnings. If I had to pick the stock I was most bullish on in my entire portfolio right now (at current prices), it would be AMR.BTU + 3.6%, FCX (copper) +3.6%. Small cap value boomed for once, with AVUV +3.1%.

Driven a ton by small banks ~$31B!!!  I feel like this completely debunks the whole credit crunch by regional and small banks thesis.Even if deposits went down I wouldn't actually be worried as long as credit was flowing heartily like it is.  We expect that deposits might shrink and that just means bank profits shrink a bit due to more expensive funding costs like brokered CDs.  But even then, excluding foreign institutions deposits, US actually went up 😂!I actually have had many long back and forth arguments with CRE doomers about office loans.  While class D properties have really taken a hit in values, many banks actually have pretty conservative LTVs and can absorb losses.  Moreover, it doesn't matter as long as banks are willing to renew loans or borrowers can refi elsewhere...  "It isn't a loss until you sell" actually applies to debt too.  It isn't a default as long as coverage ratios look healthy and the debt can be serviced (even with reduced occupancy), with loans extended or renewed.  Vacancies are slowly improving and eventually they will catch up.

I'm 30% cash and hopefully can get to maybe 50% or a little more for the Fed correction.\n\nAnyways I like AAPL long term but if its gonna go to $100 or lower .... Someone online said AAPL may hit $50 a share this summer.... Then id rather cash out tax free now and buy back in for more shares at $100 or even $50 if I'm really lucky!\n\nHow's my plan? Monda"

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 22:37:09'] If it's in a Roth why do you care about the short-term upside anyway? Even if AAPL contracts in the near term, who cares? Park your money and keep buying more shares if it goes down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 22:32:15'] I wouldn't listen to people online.  Now the 2nd quarter earning season does start in 2 weeks Tuesday (Apr 13) with the big banks starting with $JPM.  So I do think this is a pretty good time to take some profits. But you have to ask yourself why are you selling and what are you going to do with that money and what is your plan if Apple stock does not decline as you are planning?If you have a plan B...such as Dollar Cost Averaging that money into a fund or ETF like $SCHD when stocks start to fall after this earnings season if Apple doesn't fall as you are planning  than I would say sell.  Plan A is buy Apple back cheaper.  Plan B if your wrong is DCA into $SCHD or whatever index fund.No one knows what will happen.  Now there are going to be a lot of comments here saying never sell Apple, stocks only go up, etc etc etc. But yeah stock historically go down during an interest rate hike cycle and there is nothing wrong taking profits.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 22:46:05'] -90%? Lol share some of those drugs please. Markets have never and will never drop that far. There’s a reason why Apple won’t ever drop hard and that’s bc it’s proven over a long period that it’s basically invincible. People regret not buying it at $50, $60, $100, $120, $150, etc. There are too many buyers waiting on standby for it to tank. AAPL sentiment is not changing anytime soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 22:53:45'] I can't even fathom what extreme event it would take to make the market go down 90%. If that ever happens, I'm sure there will be much bigger issues to worry about.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 22:34:43'] Sounds like you got it all worked out bro! Nice flex. For what it’s worth the risk with Apple is only in your own diversification strategy. I’m selling lots too, not because I think it’s going down, but because at $3T cap, I think it will take decades to 2x. Upside not worth the heavy percentage of the portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 22:18:45'] lol someone saying apple will go down to $50 or $100 doesn’t mean it will go down that low
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 23:28:59'] It’s a Roth. You’re not taking that money out for—judging by the tone of your post—~40 years. Doesn’t make sense to try to guess when stocks are going to drop and sell and buy back in—at best, your added returns will be minimal (especially as future trading mistakes catch up with your good calls). You don’t know the future, but Apple at $100 seems unrealistic, and $50 seems downright insane asylum. You could be waiting a very long time—perhaps forever—to buy in at those levels. What would make better sense is to decide what percent of Apple you want in your portfolio, and keep it weighted at that percent. If the stock dips, buy more apple. If it appreciates higher than, say 5%, then sell. By keeping your exposure constant you’ll always sell when it spikes and buy when it dips.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 12:35:45'] I had more or less exact same arguments when I sold for $110 a bit more than a year ago xD No regrets as I put it in ETF anyway so the money made good buck either way (albeit less). But I would feel horrible if I parked any non-trivial amount of money in cash. That would be a waste of money and believe me or not - a bit more than a year ago, in the middle of pandemic, stock crash felt way more imminent than now during the recovery.Plus _cash_? During 5-10% inflation? Madness, imo.What exactly is your plan for this 50% allocation? If you really just want to play timing the market and load up on cheap stocks after correction - use margin, once the market crashes down load up on margin and deleverage during the recovery. Of course strategy works if and only if you expect you can time the market (_both_ end of growth, _and_ bottom of correction), but you seem to think you do, so margin should be safe, no?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-02 12:36:26'] When you sell apple, most likely on other side is 1. SPY 2. Apple itself via buybacks 3. Warren Buffet How many shares you want to sell to bet against them ?

That said, I not sure that Apple will be one of those companies (these are VC guys looking for Unicorns). You might be able to make a case that apple will be a safe place to leave your money as lots of people might start look for 'safe' investments. Whatever that means.

However, the idea that the S&P might fall by 90% is absolutely dumb. I'd bet everything I have on that not happening.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-03 08:25:15'] What it sounds like, is you want to take some profit in case AAPL goes back down. With the EU battery reuse laws i would agree with you. So go sell your most expensive lots with long term cap gains.  Then if it goes back down you can rebuy it lower in a month. If it doesnt put the money to use elsewhere.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 14:25:34'] So many questions.  Yes, I can imagine any of these stocks dropping 50% from here.  I don't think it's likely, but it's certainly not impossible.  They would be great buying opportunities if that happened.  No one knows where the bottom is, analysts included.  "Recession" isn't a binary state, so saying stocks will fall to 3000 if we have a recession is sort of like saying I'd wear a size XL if I became obese.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 14:17:59'] 3000 yes. 2000, unlikely.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 14:25:12'] I'll make you a bet. If AAPL and MSFT dip under $200 combined.. not quite 50% I'll buy 100 shares of each.

When I saw Burry do the same thing I got a nice dose of confirmation bias.Don't get me wrong, AAPL is a brilliant company. But it's priced for growth that I don't see happening over the next 12 months. I think QE and free money pulled a ton of their growth forward last year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 00:58:28'] Apple maybe because they're overly reliant on iPhone sales and politics could crush that and half of the world's mobile gaming revenue.  Google and especially Microsoft less so since most of their money comes from software that isn't going to be impacted by supply chain problems and also isn't overly exposed to any single country.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:22:05'] Here’s a general feature of all stocks; the lowest they can possibly go is zero. For MSFT and AAPL that risk is indefinitely small (especially considering they both hold lots of cash!). That they’ll slide 50 % from here also seems improbable but not impossible. I’d buy both if they get anywhere near those levels.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 15:02:01'] Overall there are a number of stocks  that are currently in the process of reverting to their pre-covid valuations, Apple and MS could easily follow this pattern and hit 50% down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 05:30:35'] If you have a lot of faith that AAPL will outperform the market, it's better to have individual shares.  If AAPL goes up 5% this month and you own the shares outright, you'll gain 5%.If you only own VOO, ignoring increase/decrease of other companies for simplicity, the value of those shares will go up a significantly less amount since the value of the ETF is based on the sum of all their holdings, of which AAPL is only a portion.Personally, I like investing in ETFs but also invest in the big names like GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-01 05:56:44'] Yes and no. One friend says to never allocate more than 5% of a company in your portfolio. Another friend says diversification is unnecessary and carries 60% of his portfolio in Apple. Both have done very well over the years. Pick your poison.

I started working when I was 16 and opened up an etrade account the day I turned 18 and bought $10,000 work of Amazon, I basically put my entire life savings in it...this was 2012 when they were priced around $300 a share. Fastforward to 2017 after continuing to buy more Amazon and basically nothing else...I was 22 years old with about $210,000 in amazon stock. At this point I wanted the money because I was thinking about a house and I just didn't feel comfortable with that amount of $ on one stock. I kept the amount of $ I had a secret from everybody until I finally told my parents asking them for advice. My dad is a business owner but doesn't have mch experience in stocks but he was basically like "what the fuck..." when I told him. He sent me to his financial planner and they helped me slowly sell some of the shares so it didn't overwhelm my tax liability. I still own some amazon shares to this day but I felt good about selling some of it and diversifying.&#x200B;What i'm trying to tell you is look into the future about what you need money for and base your decisions off of that. Do you feel comfortable having $210k in apple stock when you ant to buy a house soon?

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 02:24:54'] I would say if you were going all in on just one of those Apple seems to be the right one. I wonder if several of those will actually face the same gov’t breakup risks, so if in a sense diversification wouldn’t actually give you much diversity. I think Amazon is a bigger and more amazing machine than almost anyone has fathomed, spinning off one amazing revenue generator after another. Microsoft’s Twilio attack interests me. And I do wonder if IBM’s AI and cloud shift may give it greater upside than some of these others. I fail to understand why someone else can’t quickly take a big chunk of SQ’s business (small moat). Just thoughts...

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:07:46'] From mid September 2012 to February 2016 the S&P returned 40%+ while apple returned 5%.  We could absolutely see that again over a 4 year period.Apples average PE over the past 20 years is under 20.  Currently its at 37.  This might make sense if they had 10%+ growth year over year but its revenue growth has been much lower than AMZN/GOOGL/MSFT/etc.  If we see it return to its average PE we could see a drop of \~40%.  Now do I think that happens?  Probably not, but 20/30% is definitely reasonable if we see any bad news.Apple is a fantastic company worth owning, but its gotten way ahead of itself IMO.  I think its very realistic to predict it could underperform the S&P over the next 5 years.  Its much harder to predict another 5 or 10 years of 10%+ growth per year unless they have a new revolutionary product.  I would absolutely diversify, if youre completely sold on tech there are plenty of other better companies to buy, and you can still keep a considerable chunk in Apple.  One thing you could consider is selling covered calls on Apple with a January 15 expiration to delay gains until 2021 while also having some protection on the downside.Edit: 2012 not 1012
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:54:36'] Wow... interesting thread with such an odd mix of advice - some good, some just outright bad. I’ve put a fair amount of thought into this as I have an ongoing similar problem.1) - YES - diversify!  You’ve been fortunate, you’ve done well, but holding only one stock puts you in a risky position. 2) - when you sell some of the apple, you’ll be making a wise lateral move into another position or 3. You will still be in a position for great ongoing gains - there are many good investments to choose from. You are not stopping capital appreciation, you’ll simply derive it from other sources. 3) - Presuming you don’t hold these shares in a tax deferred account (IRA, 401k), You will pay a taxes. This is the bummer, as it takes the wind out of your sail and reduces your compounding gains. This is what you need to review and plan for. (If you are in a tax deferred account, you’d be in great shape and can sell all you want this year). Make a plan. My completely blind plan for someone in your situation, presuming you’re in a taxable account, is to reduce this holding to 20-30% of your portfolio over 3-4 years. I’d encourage you to sell 1/4 of your position shares this tax year, and another similar percentage next year, adjusting as you need to based on the gain or loss in the APPL position. You can use covered call options to do this and to generate additional income. That’s a whole other thread, but well worth learning about. Last obvious point:  talk to experts and don’t rely on reddit beyond getting a broad range of opinions. Consider a good advisor. Some of the trading firms can be very very helpful with basic advice and review without signing up for a managed account (plug for Schwab - their customer service has been great IMHO). Also, talk to tax advisors so you’ll know your tax liability and adjust your plan as needed.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 02:36:08'] can’t go wrong with any of those names you listed. But maybe consider ARKW or ARKK. Also may be worth allocating into VOO depending on your age.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 03:30:10'] Yes, but keep in mind that the best way for you to diversify might not be by selling but by investing into low fee index funds in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:02:12'] Here's why I think holding on to the AAPL stock is worth it (obvious reasons you probably already know but just to re-state it because we can forget this easiliy).1) People don't leave Apple. Almost every teenager I know has an iPhone and they would never leave for an Android devie.2) Strong products - Apple has a reputation of their products being reliable and long lasting3) Conspicuous consumption.  Apple products carry a premium price tag and people love to flaunt their consumption. Hence I think another reason they are so popular with teens4) Accessories.  Airpods are insanely popular.  Watches too. Apple keeps making hardware that people love and that sell like crazy.5) Services - not only the app store but banking as well...Apple has their hands in so much&#x200B;Hold your Apple shares. It's going to be $200 a share by next fall excluding any major bad events or news. I think you are fine if you want to start buying some other things to diversify, but don't dump Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:07:51'] Yes, sell it all and buy AAPL calls.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:10:30'] clearly it's worked up to this point, but this would make me a little uneasy. I'd still keep a large chunk in AAPL, but I'd move at least half to index funds.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 03:35:13'] How much did you start out with in AAPL?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 04:11:53'] I asked the same question a few weeks ago. We have a significant amount of Apple shares as well in a diverse portfolio. Our neighbor a money manager advised us to keep every share and try to buy more. Why? Apple pay. Our idea was to find baby Apples. Low entry cost with big returns later. We added Hyliion and AMD to our longterm portfolio in August.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:24:58'] Put it all into SPYG. It’s still heavily weighted in Apple but has other good tech holdings.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:26:50'] I would, as safe as Apple seems you never know. There have been several companies “too big to fail” throughout history which did. So I don’t think it is wise to have more than 10% of your portfolio in one company, personally. But also, I don’t have this all figured out, trust me.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:42:25'] People diversify their personal portfolios because they can’t afford to lose their entire retirement account due to one stock going belly up. Most people also don’t even manage their own investments, so a financial advisor is making safe investments (to save his ass and yours) for the long term. So basically, you’re looking at 3-7% yearly growth. Now if you analyze stocks and know a lot about a specific company, there should be no issue putting everything into 1 stock. The reason you own $213k of Apple shouldn’t be merely because it’s a seemingly strong company, but because you see it as a forever stock. Make sure you keep up with earnings, what the true value of the company is, and sales/business statistics. Research whether Apple is a long term viable option in the tech industry and evaluate its possible shortcomings. My suggestion is to keep this Apple growth account, as it will probably make you a millionaire one day; however, get a Roth or 401k and invest those in some safer options (ETFs).

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:09:43'] Personally one of my favorite plays right now is Chewy. They are literally the Amazon of Pet services. Let’s be honest consumer preference has shifted towards convenience (delivery, ease of dealing with customer service, etc.) and because of these Chewy will dominate for the long haul. Chewy has A+ customer service.. you get in touch with a HUMAN BEING almost immediately.. and resolve your issue quickly. Usually refunding and sending a new product, etc. It’s also worth noting adoption rates have sky rocketed through Covid-19 and subscribers have continued to rise. Pricing is aligned with store pricing (outside of coupons) and delivery is almost always free unless you’re doing a very small purchase. Subscribe and save options, and so on. I’d love to share more DD if you’re interested in them but I recommend you do your own DD (this is your hard earned money). I told some buddy’s of mine who play in the market to get in last week and up 13% already.. ER is going to blow the top off. Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:57:23'] I'm in a very similar boat. I have $210k in my Roth IRA and have been holding since 2011. I've thought about selling 100+ times over the last 9 years but have luckily held strong. They have the strongest brand in the world, new services bundle, wearables, health monitoring, AI/AR, and a recent push in India where the middle class numbers are growing like crazy makes me want to stay long for the next 10+ years. The amount of cash they have on their Balance Sheet + future earnings give them the ability to continue making strategic acquisitions. Stay long my friend.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:49:48'] Yeah, I'll PM you my bank info. You can diversify about 100k into that. 🤣

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 04:55:24'] My problem with Apple is that they're currently the largest company in the world at ~2.1t market cap. How much more room is there to grow? This is probably some sort of logical fallacy, but I'd personally rather invest in say Alphabet, which still has a ~1 trillion buffer for growth by comparison (treating Apple's current valuation as an upper bounds).
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:35:31'] A very smart financial professional and good friend had me divest all my Apple stock in 2012 and diversify to index funds. Biggest regret of my life. I started investing again in AAPL stock. I do think you should have other investments and funds, but hold on to the AAPL stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 04:09:06'] You should diversify in something else than tech
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:29:16'] I know several of the Apple earlier employees attained director or higher title. Most have diversified to other better things. They all told me no American company will stay in top positions forever.  At 0.66% yield you can do not much to live onThe exception is one person who has a cost basis of $1 (before the split). He worries about tax consequence.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:49:51'] I think putting new money into something else is a great idea. I wouldn't sell any of your Apple stock, but I probably would not buy more until you diversify a little bit.  I think SQ, MSFT and AMZN are all solid choices.  You might want to consider an ETF like QQQ, VGT or VOO (which all also contain Apple in their holdings).  This would help you diversify more broadly.  But I don't think you can go wrong with the stocks you've mentioned.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:22:22'] It’s ridiculously risky to have all your money in one sector, LET ALONE one stock. Let’s say Apple gets hit with antitrust action, or it’s revealed that execs have been inflating sales figures. Suddenly you can lose $50,000 in one session. If you want to reduce risk, you need to do some serious rebalancing. There are all sorts of online tools that can help you but maybe start with putting 50k in a Vanguard Target Retirement Admiral Shares fund.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 08:28:07'] I would gradually (2-3 year time frame) sell about 70% of your position and move it to some mix of index funds and different asset classes/industries.  Allocation will vary based on your investment timeframe/risk tolerance, but you have a decent start.  For long-term holds, I would suggest:Equities:  75%* Large Cap Growth (APPL would fit here): 40%* Large Cap Value:  20%* Small/Mid Cap Growth:  15%* Small/Mid Cap Value:  5%* International: 10%Fixed Income:  15%* Short term bonds:  5%* Midterm bonds: 60%* Long term bonds:  35%Cash: 5%Commodities/REIT/other inflation protection:  5%Again, your age and horizon are important factors here but the above template will do the job if you stick with it.  Further, spread the money around in a few different industries if you are buying individual equities.  Tech is a big driver but it is still cyclical.  There were years not so long ago where tech was treading water or growing slowly.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 08:52:27'] Yes, diversify yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:06:54'] I don’t see apple going anywhere anytime soon so just keep it in there.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:23:02'] Love your strategy. The guy who created and sold CHEWY did this with his profits. If it were me I'd be 100% in Amazon for the call selling potential, but otherwise I couldn't agree more with your strategy. I just hope you're selling tons of calls for extra income.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:18:11'] I'm in AAPL, QQQ, and VTI.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:47:23'] If you want to be seen gains 10 years from now like you are today, probably. Apple is still going to perform very well. But I honestly think a Amazon and Facebook and NVDA are where it’s at now in terms of FANGMAN.Edit I’m also massively overloaded on AMD
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 13:25:14'] I can't believe you have over $200k in a single stock. Yes, diversify - you'll make more money and be safer. Apple aren't going anywhere (i.e. they're a safe bet) but they're also not looking likely to have another iphone on their hands any time soon, and thus they won't have that incredible growth they once did.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 13:45:03'] No matter what you have and how good, you should not have any one stock be even close to 20%-30% of your portfolio much less 100.At the very least diversity into some QQQ and SPY ETFs and consider moving into the other big tech money makers like FB, Microsoft and Google. Then look into recovery stocks for small high and medium risk stocks like Southwest Airlines and Delta, JP Morgan, Citi and Goldman Sachs.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 02:22:12'] Depends, is that your entire portfolio or only 1% it doesn't matter about relative terms of money it's all about how much of your portfolio is in apple, if above 5% id diversify
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:59:14'] I'm in a similar boat.  Let me just give it to you straight.  You're probably going to lose a lot of money if you diversify.  AAPL is that good.  Ignore the last month.  Go pick up a hobby.Plus, somebody needs to tell you this - SQ, MSFT, AMZN don't make your portfolio diverse.  *These are all overvalued stocks in the same sector.*  You are just making this harder for yourself.  You have an absolute beast of a pick.  Stick with it.  You know the stock.Remember that one of the key components to picking a good long stock is buying something that is *undervalued*.  If you are shoving more money into your portfolio, *start keeping cash for a future opportunity.  When things go down, buy more.*
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 03:53:32'] I don't think you have to diversify yet. But there will come a point you wish you had. If develop a plan to start before it's too late. What's your target number for retirement? Or whatever goal you're working towards. When will you have"enough" in aapl that is trajectory plus other investments will get you to your target when you want to get there.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:31:26'] The right answer is yes....but the results say no. I have owned apple for a long time, and now I can't sell it or I would pay some extreme taxes...so letting that ride for a while, but it is only about 8% of portfolio. Now if you really like Apple look at the long calls....out to 2022.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:31:49'] Probably depends on your age, tbh. Best bet would be to take some money off the table like others have said and put it in indexes. But do what you feel comfortable with. Asking a bunch of internet strangers probably won’t do anything but aggregate a bunch of peoples views.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:35:17'] Sell covered calls on your shares and then use the $$ you make there to diversify and buy other stuff?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:39:09'] You could make bank on selling covered calls with that much Apple
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:48:06'] Its your entire portfolio?  Yeah its been a wonderful stock but you should move into conserving your wealth at the same time.  I would sell 150k minimum and just put into a few etfs.Apple will continue to grow, probably at a higher level than the market, but i worry about anti trusts
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:50:34'] Uh yeah if it's your entire portfolio you should at the very least pick 9 other companies and put it in other things.  Other people might have different thoughts but no more than 10% of your assets in one company (at least with regards to just stock) is generally smart just in case.  It would be further smart to put some of that money into non-stock things if you're doing this for retirement, but if it's just gamble money to buy a dream house with you don't necessarily have to do that.  (and if it's retirement not gamble money, ETF's are generally a good idea)
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 05:59:57'] Investing and 'diversifying' into Amazon and Microsoft is more or less the same as just keeping Apple shares. They are all tech stocks traded on same platforms and markets. If one goes down, the others will follow.I have 60% APPL, 20% MSFT and 20% AMZ. I just like psychological aspect of having multiple stock I can look at and follow. Also keeps me more interested in news about them.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:04:44'] At a sum of 213,00 as an actuary my advice would be to analyse your liabilities (do you have rent to pay, living costs, bills etc.) and find out how much risk you’re willing to take on. Based on that protect a part of your wealth (could be 50% or 70%) in dividend stocks and reinvestment funds and as for the rest go hard if your valuation of apple is that it’ll go up.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:10:31'] I'd slowly start diversifying into other companies you know and are interested in. For me that would be AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AZMN, WMT, UPS and 1 or 2 risky but smaller positions, like NIO (Chinese EV man.) and a biotech stock of choice.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:25:28'] The main concern for me would be how easily it would have been to invest in a company that didn't perform well, and you would have no failsafe. You seem to want to keep everything in Tech, which isn't fully diversifying but it's also what seems to be hot. The question is whether it's a bubble or if it's here to stay.I'd start moving some funds to electric vehicles, now that the auto industry seems to want to make the change instead of waiting for the government to force it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:25:32'] You aren't diversifying if you're simply selling Apple and buying another big tech company like Amazon or Microsoft. If I were you, I'd put the majority of that money into something like VTI. Boring, but you won't run the risk of losing a ton of it. It's fine to hold onto some Apple, but right now, you're one bad news day away from losing a lot of money.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:36:08'] It depends, if the stock drops 10% for an entire year can you be okay with possibly losing 20k? Not a sarcastic question but a personal one only you can anwser. With Apple risk is low espiciall with the split I think the demand for stock will eventually drive prices back where they were pre-split. However, there is always the human factor of who the hell knows what will happen and can you take that stress? I would diversify into some other tech stocks (Alphabets undervalued or other blue chips such as BAC). If youre looking to double your money short term but with risk, invest in vegas stocks as things continue to open up. I recommend Wynn.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:36:19'] I have much more exposure to SQ than APPL and sold MSFT
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 06:42:56'] I can't think of a reason you WOUDLN'T diversify; Apple is great but considering you've already made a ton (assuming you owned this before Q3 2020) then it would be smart to hedge your risk. Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon. Those are my next largest investments behind Apple & Penn National :)

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 07:27:12'] I normally would say yes but Apple has been killing it. Owning tech that also owns a bunch of other shit is diverse alone lol 😆
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 07:55:04'] The long answer: diversification is mostly for protection against bad decision-making. If you’re confident in your abilities to select winning stocks, don’t worry about how many stocks you own. Personally, I think AAPL is very overvalued at current prices, and it has lots of near-term downside. It is, however, one of if not the best company in the world, and long-term downside is as close to non-existent as you can get. If you plan on holding your portfolio for more than five years, Apple can create a lot of wealth for you. If you do want to diversify, I’d recommend purchasing some shares in Berkshire Hathaway. This would maintain a decent level of exposure to Apple (Berkshire’s largest holding is Apple) while also giving you indirect exposure to some of America’s other great companies (Amazon, Visa, Costco, you name it).The short answer: maybe.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:16:24'] Wow!! How did you get so much money?? If I had money like that I never even bother with stocks lol
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:24:17'] This is similar to me. I have a number of shares from ESPP and my current holdings are about 10x my cost basis. It’s my single largest holdings, but I diversify elsewhere through 401k and IRAs. It’s crazy to think years ago I almost sold for 2x my cost basis to pay off my student loans. Really glad I didn’t.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:25:13'] Nah just keep making money hand over fist my guy
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:26:16'] Depends on your risk tolerance
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:38:31'] Sell covered calls
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:40:12'] I made a lot off Apple, I start to sale after 20% profit.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:40:21'] Bro sell some of that shit before it falls today
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:40:42'] Absolutely buy into more different things. It doesn’t matter what stock you’re talking about, all in on one company is a TERRIBLE idea. You don’t even necessarily have to sell your current apple stuff, just don’t put new money into it. I’m assuming at current pricing you have a little over 900 shares?Sell some conservative covered calls and use those premiums to buy other companies.If you really have no idea what other companies you want to get involved in, you could consider some of the more popular etf’s.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:42:07'] Depends on how much money you have

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 09:59:36'] Bruh the event just keep it now and watch for the next couple of hours it should rise and then sell
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:02:22'] Yes 100% and I would do it soon. Way to much risk for a company that’s been growing mostly do to multiple expansion. Nothing really wrong with Apple but way to risky. Enjoy the gains ;)
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:10:30'] Apple has a really rich valuation. However, I think it will be a beast in the future and continue to pay a consistent dividend with room to grow another 20% to 30% over the next few years. But there are better risk reward stocks IMO with fairer valuations and more room to run than Apple. (FB, GOOG, MSFT, SKWS, DBX)
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:11:52'] My advice would probably be not to ask for advice on the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:19:04'] To truly diversify you need to select something that isn’t correlated to Apple Buying other tech companies doesn’t diversify youIt just increases your exposure to the sector
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:20:09'] Never bought aapl, does it pays dividends?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:25:35'] microsoft yesamazon maybesq maybe (higher up and downs)
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:30:10'] Find an index fund with very low fees, put your feet up, and enjoy your future. I started watching the market in the seventies - a horrible time - and learned that eventually the market comes back, but individual stocks may not. Gulf + Western was a cash cow way back when. How’d you like to be holding what used to be $213,000 of that?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:32:46'] depends what your goal is. I like the buy one strong company strategy since a singular company will outperform (or underperform) the general market. So if you have a good one it's worth it to build wealth. Now if you want to be more conservative obviously diversify.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:36:30'] How long did it take for you to accumulate that much apple?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:40:28'] Yo just gimmie some pls :)
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 10:41:31'] Honestly, if it's long term, i.e. you're not actively trading it, I don't think it's a huge issue besides you being at more risk if something bad happens to Apple specifically. Assuming nothing bad happens to Apple, you're just magnifying your gains and losses compared to the QQQ etf that's tech heavy. The benefit of the QQQ is that if Apple happens to crash, QQQ won't crash as much and will still have other stocks to make up for the loss.Like everyone knows, the only way to increase return is to increase your risk, and you're clearly doing that. You just gotta be aware of the risks you are taking.Another note is you need a plan for when to cash out, if at all (like not cashing it all out during retirement age to keep it for your kin). Especially in retirement age, you'll want to decrease your investments in stock in general (or invest in safer stocks at minimum) when you're starting to take from the portfolio/your investments to live off of, because if there's a recession, you'll still need to withdrawal from your portfolio to live...Edit: Now would be a good time to cash out and buy the dip later... If you want the extra profit.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 11:14:51'] How old are you and what’s your goal? That’s what matters. I would diversify into mostly growing companies and a few safe bets
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 11:23:27'] Microsoft and Tesla bro
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 11:24:30'] I feel you, I've got 185k of Bll, been such a winner it's hard to sell. Slowly sell and diversify. This way you'll feel ok about it whether it goes up or down
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 11:26:03'] No, very bad time to start diversifying. and tech(including apple) is kinda on a bull run. Except you got some specific value investments in mind
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 11:28:58'] Diversity will help you sleep at night.  Amzn, would be a good choice, Msft too both have a small dividend.  I'd do a four/five way split.  Maybe set some in an index fund; Vanguard 500 or something similar.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 11:29:00'] You could park some money into VTI (Vanguard's total stock market index ETF) which is extremely diversified in nature. Over time, it has very consistent returns. It's definitely a buy and hold stock though, so keep that in mind.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 11:37:40'] I read an article about the founder of Chewey who sold his company and put the whole fortune in two stocks - Apple and Wells Fargo

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:15:04'] depends on how much your portfolio that represents
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:15:47'] You don't have to do it all at once, but yeah. It's probably a good call.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:22:12'] Apple is like my family mascot. Mom bought apple in 1989 and kept buying. She's seen a +1000% return. She has some positions in Tesla and energy recently but almost all Apple. She uses it now as a hoard that she liquidates anytime she needs cash.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:26:07'] It’s like the biggest company in the world. I don’t see too much upside from current valuation but who knows, it could still 10x from here somehow anyway
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:49:48'] Yes. Diversify those stocks into my account. So it’s more balanced :D
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:53:42'] Yes since Apple is already a tech giant and cash rich company, it has very less room to expandYou can diversify by putting your money into 1. Moderate-Low Dividend Stocks (Eg. Walmart, Johnson, Coca-Cola, Starbucks)2. Tech stocks (Eg. Microsoft, Roku, FB)3. Real Estate ( Eg.willow )4. Entertainment stocks (Eg. Roku, Netflix, Amazon)
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 12:55:03'] Tesla is the new apple now and it has so much growth ahead
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 13:02:53'] Just sell half and buy amazon. Personally I think amazon has a better valuation compared to AAPL. Amazon will be worth 2tril in the near future. Don’t try to manage your money too much unless you have the discipline to sell at the highs (eg. End of august) My most profitable moves have been the ones I mostly ignored. Eg. Appl 10 years ago.LULU looks good too
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 13:35:18'] i would put half in Tsla.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 15:00:41'] Without knowing your overall portfolio value one can’t answer this question.  If you have $100m portfolio then whats $213k?  if your overall portfolio is only $300k then yes you need diversification.  A percentage would have been more valuable information than your dollar amount.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 15:08:37'] Just curious, what is your average price? I would never advise to invest everything into one stock, it makes you way too dependent on one entity. But then again, it is likely that Apple will grow in the coming years.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 15:33:32'] Worthless post without saying what percent of your portfolio and net worth it is...
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 15:36:02'] this is one hell of a flex. congrats.consider opportunity costs. for new money going into portfolio, would make sense to add a different company if expected return is higher than your expectations of apple’s return. otherwise, why not buy more apple.would sell apple only if it is a busted growth story in your mind. it is so unlikely apple would ever go to zero. it has more cash than many governments. even if it is in decline like, say ibm, you would have many years to get out before it would ever go to zero, so there’s very little risk in my mind. as i see it, it’s only a question of opportunity cost versus other investments.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 15:40:26'] Ride that Apple long time!
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 15:50:43'] Based on your interest in tickers, Amazon would be the safest and best option...  that’s the number one company id be throwing all that money into and I have 92% Apple portfolio 😅 but if you’re going to diversify then you might wanna do some research in other sectors and spread your investments out

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 16:34:31'] Moving from a top 5 tech company to other top 5 tech companies isn’t really diversifying.. so I’d say nah don’t bother

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 16:40:32'] I love SQ, MSFT, and Amazon. Cant go wrong with those companies either. I wouldnt sell to diversify because of taxes. Just use your next pay checks or dividends to buy the others.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:00:22'] I bought SQ before the crash, I think what is happening in the world is making it strong. Would definitely diversify portfolio. As others have said, different industry is also worth investing.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:14:20'] Thats alot in one stock but the house that Jobs built isnt going anywhere.Personally I would buy realestate.I pulled 300k out out my mutual fund portfolio  10 years ago to buy  properties then got back into stocks as a day trader.Staying in stocks I think the video game and online retail sectors will be huge and have plenty of room to grow with that kind of capital I would diversify into the 3 A's, Alibaba ,Alphabet ,and Amazon
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:19:38'] Are you an AAPL employee? I have the same concern but with MSFT. I wouldn't consider diversifying your position by getting more tech.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:37:03'] I wish I would have held on to AMD. I know it's a meme stock but I really liked their vision and road map. One of those companies that I have always been a fan of and believed in. Back when it was in the single digits I loaded up with 1000 shares, which on my grocery store salery is a lot lol. I knew it would rise but unfortunately I fell on hard times and had sell way too early. I cut even, actually I took a small tiny profit, but looking at it now makes me sick lmao.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:44:34'] I wouldn’t diversify OP. Naysayers here are trying to make you poor like them. If buffet recently took a larger position in Apple, that’s a sign you’re doing something good. I would like to gain your fortitude to dump most of my networth into a solid stock and hold for years.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:51:59'] Yes, you should give half of it to us and diversify
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:56:33'] Well it depends how much 200k is to you? How much do you have in cash reserves and cash flow? 5k 50k 200k 500k 800k or 1M sitting in the bank? Unemployed? Making 350k/yr? Ultimately it’s a very personal question that depends on your own financial situation
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 17:59:54'] How much was your initial investment in Apple and how long did it take to build to this?
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 18:16:54'] nah, you're fine
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 18:18:37'] Um don't diversify now while it's at a few month low. But otherwise, yes.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 18:19:28'] When ppl say to diversity they mean diff sectors, stocks, bonds, real estate. A smart man told me once how much would I bet for 2:1 odds? Stocks have worst odds. Remember IBM, GE, XOM seemed unstoppable at once.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 20:54:28'] I had 100k in apple and i diversified because you can gain jist as much with a welth of good stocks also, maybe even more.  There is no guarantee apple will blow up, and they are depending on huge upgrade numbers.  It can happen yes, but you can also be missing out on better gains also.  Look at Roku, chewy, twlo, Nio...  these are solid plays for long runs. I added farfetch, docu, twlo, Band, zoom, Pins, pltr. Ayro,   work, spt, Tsm.  And i made more with these then i have with apple in the short term. Apple may hit 3trill, but it also has a huge panddmic and people are tight eith their money now.  So i dont know. Just my five cents and couple stocks for you to review.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 21:04:47'] Depends on how comfortable you are with the risk (and I guess age in that sense).  Apple should continue to be a sound investment.  That being said, if you do purchase some of the other, also reliable and growing, stocks you avoid a situation where you are all in.  If Apple were to crash, your portfolio has a tough road back
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-13 21:24:40'] Keep doing what’s working but I’d definitely branch out into better growth stocks and diversify at least a little

POST_TEXT: b"I was watching CNBC tonight and it was the Chartmaster segment with Carter Worth.\n\nAfter him they had a frequent analyst guest on but I forgot his name.  \n\nAnyways the second guest was talking about AAPL and that it's historic pe is about 16 and that he thinks it could even get down to 10 PE?!\n\nSo I figured it out and if I'm correct this puts AAPL at a little more than $60?\n\nThis would mean about a 60% fall from here.\n\nWhat's your opinion on this?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 18:17:35'] If Apple were to hit $60 it's very likely that earnings plummeted, a P/E ratio of 10 seems low.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 17:53:21'] I think a 10 PE seems extremely unlikely.  If there was a literal depression - sure.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 19:06:22'] Reason you hear people claiming something might be even worse than historical norm, is because its going to be worse. You see it happening already. Look at Target. Future earnings are becoming worthless if not massively able to negate assumed levels of inflation, cost of financing, labor, inventory, etc. Their earnings were bad...but they lost 1/4 of value over 1Q of bad earnings.They were also like major factor in todays drop. Retail is down, not horrible, but relative to shit not even adjusted with current inflation, let alone future, and markets were looking to them as a key guage (and wal mart too) in what to expect this yr. But marginal demand from consumers as we start to watch our paychecks shrink, profits become worth less, expenses cost more, etc...eh.Apple @ 60ish doesn't sound insane if next yr they can only sell half their phones, which cost 25% more to produce (exaggeration...just saying tho)
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 19:40:39'] Stop watching Jim Crater
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 17:50:15'] This is why using historic pe is not particularly useful and misses a lot of the picture
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 23:45:49'] This guy should change his name to Carter Worthless..I watched his video from 2019 and he said to sell AAPL at $64ish (presplit)! For some reason he's super bearish on AAPL.. maybe to swoop up our shares on the cheap? Another gem: on Dec 13 2021 he said it was time to buy the shanghai index etf (FXI) @ $37 and now it's $29.. Last summer he said to buy WMT and sell COST while they both do the opposite what he said.. lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 18:56:03'] It could happen if apples growth slowed to negative or 0 like Cisco today. Personally though, I believe apple is still growing and expanding rather than contracting in terms of their business. The services business is new and growing, so are the AirPods, and potentially they could make new products in the future. So yeah 60 or 200 are both fair guesses
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 19:54:07'] Then tesla will be $90.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 20:11:49'] Apple also had revenue growth of 1-5% and 90% was related to hardware.  There revenue stream is now more diverse.Ppl also thought smart phones would eventually reach terminal value like what happened to computers.  Android and samsung were bigger threats.   Tim cook was a bad ceo and only good at supply logistics.  Apple not innovating.  Common criticisms back then.  I think apple is overvalue but the apple 5 years ago is not the same as today.  Their ecosystem is incredibly powerful and moaty.  The black swan for apple would be china.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-19 00:25:42'] My take: if everybody runs in one direction (out of tech and into energy, oil whatever) it's usually a good idea to go the opposite way if you can stomach the volatility - you'll come out ahead long-term!
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 17:50:12'] Wouldn’t surprise me. Maybe by 2023. I honestly feel like we are headed for one of the biggest crashes we’ve ever seen
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 18:04:46'] If you look at Apple's charts.  $60 after all the splits would only put it down to Oct 2019 highs.  Why is this unreasonable?  How many other stocks have we seen fall? Apple has a lot of headwinds.  Where are they getting their microchips from? At what price?  There is regulatory headwinds.  How long until they are broken up? They have a near monopoly on smart phones and their e-commerce store.  I don't think $60/share is unreasonable at all.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 17:53:18'] Uhhhh no lol. Definitely possible but unlikely. Using 60 dollar December 16, 2022 puts delta as a probability proxy the market has given it a 1.2% probability by then.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 19:13:50'] Apple spent years at 12 PE.   Then the stimulus and low interest rates came and it jumped to something like 30.   I wouldn't be surprised to see it come down to Earth unless their services revenue keeps growing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 18:04:28'] Look at any other leader in that space, Nokia, Motorola. Blackberry. Apple has been living off its legacy for years, but those margins won’t survive the next recession
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 19:10:13'] Yes it is possible. And not even all that irrational to think it may get there. It was at 11 10-11 years ago.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 19:20:37'] That would be great, I’d love to buy Apple at 10 p/e.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 20:46:24'] My magic 8 ball says maybe $60 or maybe $200
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 20:53:11'] Apple hits $60 if China declares war on taiwan
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-19 00:46:01'] Also I think apples growth in the long term is not going to be as rapid as, say, Alphabet. Hence why Apple is trying to move into cars to get extra source of revenue. They had these record quarters thanks to people literally spending stimulus money on iPhones.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-19 07:22:33'] Wouldn't that put us in one of the worst market recessions in history if it hits that point?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-19 08:33:41'] Hey again AAPL to 116 is likely in this downtrend. There will be many small rallies. That’s the first target. 53 would be the next but that would be silly. Spy would need to head back to 250 for that. Either way. Like I’ve said in previous posts, go learn the strat. Promise you it is worth your time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 18:22:18'] If apples growth rate falls below 5% that can absolutely happen
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 19:21:18'] they might be hit by supply chain issue.  i dont know how bad it is.  they might have reduce sell for their product this year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 06:21:24'] I’d actually prefer the overall market to languish around these levels for the rest of the year seeing as I’m a middle aged accumulator.I’m an optimist about the economy in general and have been for many years, but I do think we have quite a long ways to go to get through this era of tightening and high rates.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 15:50:19'] Commodities part 3:Food related commodities.Here is a list of food commodities that have peaked during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The % shows how much it dropped since. (A non negligible portion of those also peaked during or after the Pandemic).Wheat  -50%Palm Oil  -55%Canola  -40%Sunflower  -60%Rapeseed  -62%Butter  -35%Corn  -22%Lean Hogs  -35%Beef  -18%All right, so, to be honest it was hard to find correlations for the food commodities, they are all over the place, but here are the ones that shown a significant increase after they bottomed in the beginning of the pandemic. The % shows the increase since then.Orange Juice  +200%Rice  +50%Sugar  +200%Potatoes  +1500%Feeder Cattle  +95%Live Cattle  +100%Salmon  +135%Ok two things I wanna point out here, 1st is that, unfortunately, food got more expensive since the beginning of the pandemic and it doesn't seem to be improving which is not what I was expecting.Also wtf is going on with potatoes prices! I use trading economics for this whole series of comments and ... [see for yourself](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/potatoes). Since it was a bit to hard to believe I went and checked on some other sources [like this one from FRED.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU01130603) who tells a whole different story but still talks about higher prices. Enough about potato prices.Here is a list of the other food commodities that I was getting tired of trying to fit into patterns because I was starting to lack imagination and I just want to move on with my life. I added some notes with each of them.Milk: Bottomed in March 2020. seesawed up and down violently and is now in it's average historical price trending down.Cheese: Moves in tandem with milkCoffee: Traded rather low for 2 years until March 2021 where it dramatically increased, it has been seesawing downward slowly since, still quite elevated.Oat: Rather low for 6 years until Nov 2020 where prices got outta control and reach it'speak a year later, now back down to it's lows.Tea: Seesawing up and down but nothing really worth noting here.Poultry: Constant progressive increase since March 2018, it's declining but still twice higher than 2018.Eggs US: Nothing special here until March 2022 where it started to take off 4x to reach it's peak in end of 2022 it has fallen sharply since almost back to trend.All right, that sums it up. I recommend when doing a fundamental analysis of a company that you always consider what commoditiesthey benefit/depend on. Also, I'm disappointed to notice that foodcommodity prices are still rather elevated compared to metals and energy which have both dropped significantly since the post pandemic and Russian invasion.Last note, it seems Trading Economics track future contracts prices so it may not exactly be in direct correlation with the increase/decrease with the food you buy at the grocery store.

AVUV up 1.6%. My $170 sell order for Apple almost hit (just a trim). AMD popping. SBUX I am very bullish about long term. So the Chinese reopening has been a bit muted, but what the commodity experts/analysts have been saying is that while Chinese industrial/manufacturing activity has been muted, Chinese consumer activity is booming. People are going out/about, spending, traveling. This is bullish oil, but it isn't until factories are running full steam that commodity demand *really* picks up. Point being, I think the post-lockdown SBUX spending is going to be huge. And as all the US economic data is showing, slowdown or not, we are *not* seeing a consumer slowdown in spending/earnings. [See comment from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/130fbuf/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/jhz9u4a/) So not worried about US sales going down for SBUX.

I expect money to exit the USD safe harbor as interest rates stabilize (and therefore USD to weaken), but I'm also an idiot, and money leaving USD doesn't necessarily mean it's going to flow into Yen. Basically I wanna gauge if I have better chances of a good exchange rate if I exchange now or closer to the trip date.I will probably just exchange some now, and some closer to the actual trip date to hedge

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 09:49:26'] A fun sanity check for everyone who warns about volatility decaying returns on TQQQ, especially when referenced for use in longer term bets.YTD is fairly volatile, with ups downs and flats. QQQ: 20.55% (×3 = 61.65)TQQQ: 60.95% ( - 61.65 = -0.7%)Expense ratio: ~1%.It's really not that bad, as long as there is a *net trend* between your buy and sell. You can even set up an excel sheet and check it out - all that "×3 down then ×3 up and you're net down!" Really disappears when any significant *net* trend develops.Food for thought.

It basically shows liquidity and behavior of stocks at the margin NOT necessarily the belief of all market participants that determines fluctuations in price.Edit: it's brilliant but obvious when you think about it.  Buffett is the largest holder of AAPL outside passive investing.  If AAPL tanked 50% tomorrow, HE WILL NOT DUMP.  If it moons 50% in one day he also WILL NOT DUMP.  Despite being the largest holder, he has zero impact on its price.  He will also never short companies.  So in the long-run people like him buy when it reaches absurdly low levels.  But in the short-term the price is driven by the most emotional and news-sensitive segment of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 08:51:25'] If you are only torn between those two, then Amazon, easily. It is undervalued, unlike Apple which is overvalued at the moment. Besides, Amazon stock has been stale for over a year, while the company invested huge ammounts of capital in itself, so now is a great time to take advantage of this before the stock price catches up to the company's true value.

Also Apple hired loads of people from those other companies. &#x200B;>Somehow it is almost twice as fast as my last years i7 with almost 3 times the better battery life and fans don't even turn on.Because the software is optimized for it and it is a different architecture. The processor itself is not twice as fast. &#x200B;>i absolutely can not wait for their AR/VR hardware and even car chips. Just imagine how much tech IP and leverage they have in chip designing now. I don't even think most people are valuing AAPL's silicon in their models.Getting into low margin industries is not Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 02:24:31'] > “We believe this ban is narrowly focused as it applies to only CII operators,” they wrote.China uses its government procurement process as a means of industrial policy. This is just a way of helping with import substitution, at the margin.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 05:05:08'] This cold war between the US and China is just starting to gain momentum. Expect more bull headed driven actions to occur. I really don't see any chance of an amicable detente.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 03:15:09'] Down 6% in pre-market. I expect a much larger drop when the market opens since the market can be overly dramatic. This has minimal impact on Micron for now, but of course there is a risk that their other products will get investigated as well.The silver lining here is that their dependance on China is much lower than it was a few years ago.Edit: The NLST lawsuit however, might be a bigger short term issue for Micron.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 03:45:58'] Micron not only loses 11% of their revenue. They also sell to other companies who then sell products including Micron chips to China which are also banned. Microns revenue is already at 2018 levels which will now be significantly lower in the next quarters.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 15:17:26'] China will definitely ban US low end chips if it can, as the US will definitely ban exporting high end chips to China. Sell while you can.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 04:53:12'] This is a way bigger deal for the overall stock market than people think.Since Trump set out to destroy Huawei, China has not done the same to any American company. They held back.This is the first or one of the first explicit moves to ban an American company in China. From here, things can escalate very quickly into other companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 05:03:32'] 6% drop is nothing. Semiconductor companies have been on a crazy bull run. Anything is going to get the stock up.I would not be surprised if the drop reverses during trading and markets think this news is bullish.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 04:08:14'] Amazing how these companies are so big yet manage to keep growing. It will be interesting if they can keep this growth for the next years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 04:23:33'] MSFT is a train in the portfolio especially with dividend reinvestment
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 18:36:31'] Makes sense, Apple's primary business is phones, computers, and other electronics, and in case you haven't noticed, there's a serious chip supply chain issue at the moment.Microsoft and Google, by contrast, are mostly software companies - their electronics are a side business.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 09:19:51'] Doesn't pass the smell test. Apple had a PE of 13 five years ago and Google never traded under 20. Not sure if you're talking about Microsoft's "brand" or market cap. Brand is subjective but if market cap Microsoft had the largest market cap in 2019 too.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 22:11:06'] Hmm I think the PE ratio is not true as well. I remember APPL trading for 12-13 P/E ratio in 0218, and everyone was saying APPLE was gone when they decided to stopped reporting iPhone sales number or so
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 17:29:15'] not true. Microsoft was more valuable than apple in march of 2020 and also most of 2018-2019.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 11:49:25'] Apple just demolished FB and SNAP. I imagine Apple will have an amazing run in 22.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 21:04:46'] Apple also has pushed out less impressive products imo. Every iPhone since the 10 has been more or less the same. The debacle with the TouchBar and donglebook pro, Apple seems to be moving backward to fix their own design flaws instead of leading the industry in pure innovation. I love Apple but would love to see them drop something that’s a total game changer
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 14:02:01'] This alone should be a warning sign.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 17:31:44'] What is P/E and how does it relate to those stocks?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 08:47:06'] I personally believe Apple will make a come back in their next earnings. Tim mentioned in the last earnings that the new M1 chips are selling very well but not included in this earnings.Whoever is #1 doesn't matter for me. I own both MSFT and AAPL as well as Google.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 17:46:58'] China is the \*source\* of the supply chain so their supply chain issues are less serious than those of the US. The Chinese real estate market will not suffer a disorderly collapse. You have it backwards. The country that's about to suffer a crash of the stock and real estate market is the US.

POST_TEXT: b'Apple perhaps is one of the most popular stock being the highest market cap and found it many investors portfolio. After dipping due to the in-app purchase lawsuit with Epic Games, I couldnt resist and bought a few shares of my first $AAPL stock ~$150 planning to hold them for many years. \n\nIs $AAPL always a good buy at any price? Especially the iPhone 13 event is coming next week, it could dip even further and when Apple Car is ready it can be huge in the future EV market. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on $AAPL in the long term since their main source of revenue is currently from iPhones compared to Amazon as more diversified business?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 08:17:39'] No. It's Saturday. Wait until Monday.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 23:12:05'] Got me 420 shares…started with 15 around 7/8 years ago.  It’s split twice and I’m holding for life:) Buy now it dropped pretty good today!!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 22:47:10'] Holding Apple long term is a fantastic investment. Don’t get caught up in the ups and downs of the market. Long term you won’t be disappointed with Apple. Just do some due diligence to ensure you’re making the best choice for you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 07:25:11'] "planning to hold them for many years." If you're planning on buying and holding anytime is a good time to buy APPL.I'm expecting the stock to go down in the coming weeks after the new iPhone presentation (not much, but probably back to 130's)
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 03:20:12'] Dunno if any more dip this September? Oh well u know what they say… timing market something beat something something
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 00:49:00'] Apple is the top holding in most index funds so it depends if you’re already holding those and, if so, how much additional benefit you think grabbing individual shares on top of that would actually give you.  What are your motivations for holding Apple in general? If you’re just trying to game a product release, options are prob the better move. * sidenote - no stock is a “good buy at any price” if you meant that question literally, OP.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 13:27:30'] Apple usually goes down on their event days
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 23:11:39'] AAPL this coming Tuesday has their iPhone 13 release so getting in now especially with that dip today not a bad idea IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 10:38:50'] Is apple a good company? Yes! Is it good to hold on to? Also, probably, yes! Is it good to buy ‘whatever the price’? No, definitely not. Find what you think Apple will grow to become and measure that stained other companies. Is Apple the best investment still? For me it’s not, I stopped buying shares. I have to constantly look at my “analysis” to remind myself to not buy more but that’s where I’m at. I felt there are things available for a better price than AAPL. If we have a big correction I’ll probably scoop some up but I’m holding off for now..
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 05:09:45'] It's always a good time to buy AAPL.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 06:56:43'] I’m a long time AAPL holder. Can’t remember how many I bought at the time, but thanks to all the splits over the last decade I topped off around 1600 shares. Trimmed that by half because I was too heavy in one stock, but buy and hold is always a good strategy.  I like AAPL long term and don’t plan on selling what I have left anytime soon.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 07:23:41'] I’ve taken to following a rule I’ve seen posted on this sub - If Apple dips more than 2% then add a little more to my portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 15:08:11'] 10 years ago was a good time to buy Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 01:53:34'] I own 113.73 shares since split last year. Currently up 27.88% after down day

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 13:46:16'] When is it not a good time to buy Apple should be the real question.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 06:09:32'] Wait...just wait. Look at the annual chart for AAPL. When it drops from ATHs it takes several weeks. So wait for it to drop more then start buying shares on the dips. AAPL will pop a bit next week in anticipation of the iPhone event and then drop for another two weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 00:34:14'] Yes.  (Disclosure, I own 100 shares, which I only really plan to sell either if I'm starving or if something *very* strange happens in Cupertino.)  AAPL is probably one of the most solid value stocks ("boomer stocks") out there.  Could the iPhone 13 cause a dip?  Sure, but it could also cause a spike, unless you know something I don't.  Value stocks are marathons, not sprints.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 11:18:01'] Ofc, I bought more yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 11:43:51'] Could be, apple has always been a great long term investment and just this week their stock dipped
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 13:22:21'] It’s still one of those blue chip stock so buy and hold away. TSLA, on the other hand, need to buy in when they have a dip due to Elon smoke too much weed.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 17:36:58'] This stock is move slower than my grandma Cadillac
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 02:21:13'] I hate AAPL. That being said, even I bought calls for $160 strike exp in december cuz i know it's always a solid investment and has been on an upswing lately. Hoping i dont get burned in 3 months.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 16:18:21'] buy this dip for sure !!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 04:43:21'] Too expense, not much upside potential relative to the market, high potential downside. Sentiment is too hyped. A lot of people sitting on millions in gains on these shares. Skip it, especially since if you hold a large cap fund, you are already exposed to it and similar companies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 04:01:32'] I just sold mine. Maybe losing the Epic lawsuit doesn't matter, maybe it is a big oof for Apple, but I don't want to stress about it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 06:31:26'] It is priced like a mid cap growth stock and it's a 2.4 trillion company. Valuation is stupid. Retail is blinded by last year's result, and mindlessly project it into the future like it's sustainable. Right time to buy was 2018, now it's not worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 00:04:08'] Yeah depends on your time horizon but if you’re playing the long game, then yes it’s a buy. Unless you think you won’t be typing this on an iPhone or MacBook in a few years time (lol)
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 18:33:09'] They just lost a law suit that will shave $$$ from their bottom line. Buy mid late Nov not sooner
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 00:40:43'] The smart thing to do is a high dividend US etf.  Tech is valued at insanity, Apple makes most of its profits from a single stagnant device with elastic demand.People wont like this opinion but you need some cynicism.  Things could easily happen, China banning iphone, a recession happens and people stop upgrading every couple of years, etc..Though Ive never known how people can waste so much on a device every year, even when times are good.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 03:58:49'] If you don't have any yet then yeah great buy in imo. All though there could be some more sell off in the not so distant future, just a guess. SPY correction though might make everything cheap soon...and yeah yeah I know SPY correction doesn't mean imminent crash. It does point to major sell offs in house hold name stocks like FAANG stocks and Microsoft. If you track the SPY you can time your long term buy ins pretty well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 04:12:21'] I am a new investor who started April 2020. I am probably making every mistake there is to make, but I sold most of my high return stocks this summer expecting a correction in September or October, turning full bear in the short run.Yet I could not resist buying Alibaba and Apple on the dips.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-14 10:32:05'] Yes buy on the current dip. People are waiting to see if it will test 145 or something but anywhere around here is a buy.  Cook just disclosed 40% growth in iPads and that means every other sector of hardware is growing as never before as well.  Services may take a hit from the epic lawsuit (not right away but eventually)  but Apple has plenty of time to make up for any slowness there by growing other sectors, like advertising which it has never really exploited, but if they take a hit on video games, they can make up for it with ads.  And btw these will be ethical ads, that is no datamining.  I still see $200 within a year and SWKS is also a buy, a key Apple supplier which for no good reason is a bit beaten down.  Instreaming media, VIAC is a steal, T a bargain buy and Apple may make a  big move with an aquisition, though that would be first for them. They usually only buy small strategic companies but if they want 100+ million of streaming subs they need to buy a chunk of Hollywood and VIAC is the obvious target.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 15:43:57'] Apple is a great company that will most likely edge out the SPY for returns over the next few years however [it is my LEAST favorite large-cap tech stock](https://viz.wiijii.co/chart/?id=-MjpvHnVGjOvgLGqdaIb).

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 00:08:03'] Looks like sentiment on this sub is uniformly bullish on mega cap tech.   I would urge you to be skeptical of what analysts say AND what randos on this sub say Keep in mind that 1.7 annual returns could involve huge melt ups and crashes,  not a steady 1.7% pa.  Also remember that whenever valuations get too high,  or indices get too concentrated in one set of companies,  it tends to unwind regardless of the business quality.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 09:26:56'] That’s a pile of nonsense. Those companies are at the core of the world’s economy, and as the world becomes more digital these companies grow along. This analyst should be ignored.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 07:02:22'] The idea that we should not expect any innovation over the next decade seems a bit silly. It’s very hard to imagine them continuing to grow at this crazy rate, but 1.7%?  Sounds like the strategist is just trying to get some attention.

I've been moaning about large cap valuations for a few months now, but even I don't think large cap valuations are so excessively high that you would only expect to see a 1.7% return over a decade assuming interest rates remain relatively stable. Most experts can barely predict what's going to happen in the economy 6 months out, let alone 10 years. Any predictions more than 2 years out should be ignored completely.A lot of analysts are seeing opportunities in small caps relative to large caps at the moment so my guess is that some are painting an excessively negative picture of large cap returns to scare investors into following them into small caps. What I would say is that flat year for a stock like AAPL is absolutely possible at this point, even two flat years wouldn't be unthinkable given its valuation, but flat for a decade? I very much doubt it...
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 03:38:35'] The problem with her logic is that the mega caps will not only print money but expand into other areas. EVs for example, cars will not be the same in the next 10 years. TSLA is already a computer on wheels and it improved with every update. All of the mega tech have a play in an industry that will go through the biggest revolution in history. Then there is AR/VR, cloud, more people buying and using mobile computers. Bottom line is we are spending more time using a screen and becoming more dependent on these companies. So unless everyone slows down their usage and these companies stop expanding into other areas I don’t see them stagnating.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 05:04:59'] remindme! 10 years
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 05:52:39'] The analyst's 10 year preview is a fancy excel that they keep polishing every time a company will publish results. It's useless for such a long time prediction, kind of like the 5 year projection of ARK which is pure hopium. I work in dev at a bank and got the chance to speak directly to some of the analysts in the field, many of them will cover a company but have absolutely no clue how does that company actually make money as they only look at financials or know the industry from reading various reports. Don't get me wrong, these are smart people but their method is flawed like many bank procedures which haven't changed in years even though everyone can see the problem the change is very hard in a huge strictly regulated company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 06:17:22'] Don't fail to look at the products and the pipeline, dependable revenue. This market is different given we are in a technological renaissance of AI and AR. It doesn't feel like it, but this is comparable to early internet days IMO. It's just the beginning and big tech is on the forefront.

Depending on your age, 30% of your portfolio focused on big tech isn’t really a big deal.  If it grows faster than the rest of your portfolio you may want to consider trimming back but I would really only do that if your portfolio becomes large enough that a single asset downturn could cause disruption to your retirement plans.  At that point you start considering more diversification to reduce volatility of the portfolio.  That being said, Apple/Microsoft are the two largest companies in the indexes so whatever...

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 16:53:34'] AAPL market cap hit $1T right before the pandemic. That valuation was based way more on their existing ecosystem than future bets.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 18:25:17'] The hard and honest truth - you gambled on AAPL getting a bump today, probably off of the stimulus news, and now you're learning how quickly options let you light money on fire when the market moves against you. I think that you'll be lucky if your calls break even, and if you do make money it's likely going to gut you over the next few months in the process. To me, today proved that the market is drunk on stimulus and that more money is going to do little to support it the prices we see, even now. I could be wrong, it could turn around, but I'm not counting on it. Sounds like you learned a $3k dollar lesson, either learn from it or double down and make it $6k/$9k/$12k (judging by your position I'm guessing $12k was your investment or thereabouts). If you believe in AAPL long term, roll your calls out into LEAPS or close out the option position and buy shares and then forget about it for a while or average down if you have more to spend (and want to).

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 22:08:00'] I just don’t get why folks just don’t buy straight shares instead of calls. It seems to not work out most of the time. But what do I know. 4 shares (just starting my journey with AAPL).
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 19:15:56'] If you want to buy it at a discount, sell a put instead of buying a call. Price drops, you’ve got your stock at a sweet set price (strike minus premium). Price goes up, buy it at that price knowing you can keep the premium from the put. Plus, I’d rather sell a decaying asset (time) than buy it. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 17:37:24'] There's two ways of looking at it:1) Historically Apple has had a P/E of 15-20. Using 2021 forecasted earnings, a price of $90 would still put their P/E at the high end of that range. Still feels very pricey at $116 from that perspective, especially in an environment where we know interest rates will eventually go up.2) The 200 day moving average is at $114. That should be near term support. But if it breaks that... look out below. I don't see the next support until at least $100 and then $90 to $70 beyond that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 17:54:16'] I first bought AAPL in Feb 2015 and everyone thought I was crazy because it was so overvalued. 8 months later it was trading below where I purchased, so I bought more. Then when it hit 1T mkt cap, people told me I should sell, so I bought more. At nearly 2.5T and a declining 1M chart, everyone told me to start selling my shares, so I bought more. AAPL is not only still a growth stock, but a growth stock that invests more in both R&D and investor returns (i.e., divvies) than basically any company in the entire US. And because they care about investor returns, they'll simply engage in share buybacks if the stock price starts moving too far away from where they want. Moral of the story, always buy AAPL, but don't expect short-term results. Long-term play, so go buy some Jan calls at like $140 strike. Bet those will be cheap tomorrow if there's a moderate pull back after today's big move in tech stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 20:34:53'] AAPL literally had their best quarter maybe ever in the last ER, and nothing has changed fundamentally about the company since then. I think it goes without saying, but I'm definitely in the BTFD camp on AAPL.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 09:16:59'] AAPL is a cash cow with a pipeline full to the brim with every major growth theme: AR, VR, EV, 5G, fintech, streaming, and gaming. If it weren't already 12% of my portfolio, I'd be a buyer here. It's going to bounce back.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 19:18:30'] This year bounce should be happen most in amzn, fb. AAPL probably will be back to its all time high by year end but won't go over it until more infor for their new products focused around augmented reality.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 20:19:11'] I need to buy some more AAPL soon, thank you for reminding me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 20:02:55'] By June imo those should absolutely print as im guessing the squeeze will squoze by then. But im personally absolutely convinced that this market crash isn't about interest rates as cnbc would have us believe. I truly believe it's whales taking money out to either cover gme, get in on gme, or increase their long positions as this is a once in a lifetime event. Also a nice side effect for them will be to punish the common folks 401k's and try to blame that on wsb to force some more regulations on small traders. Just my conspiracy theory opinion tho...
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 19:37:33'] I am going to keep buying as much as I can right now, and I'll keep averaging down if I have to.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 08:14:20'] Apple is one of the safest stocks to buy, any dip is just a discount. If you buy and hold don’t worry about the drops, remember it isn’t just Apple, the whole market has been red these past few weeks. Apple isn’t going anywhere. If you’re going to buy options, it’s better to buy ones that are months or years from expiration, but since you can’t predict downturns that makes them really risky. Imo just buy the stock. Personally I’m completely rebalancing my portfolio so I can “set and forget”, and AAPL is definitely on the list.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 09:23:49'] AAPL is long long long...bought in 2006 at $92...split twice already...up over 900% going to buy more if dips below $110...by 2026 it will split again...great stock to be long on
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 21:04:14'] AAPL is probably the greatest company in the world.Between the apple car, apple AR/VR contact lenses/glasses and their incredible phone and software innovation, I believe it will only widen the gap toward world domination.If there was only 1 stock I could own for the rest of my life it would be apple.Even at a $2 trillion market cap I think they are criminally undervalued, they should be trading at 100’s of p/e, like everyone else with a disruptive and highly growth focused business model.They are going to continue to develop products we don’t even know we need until they make it, then everyone on earth is going to have to have one. TLDR, yes it will bounce soon, and then continue the worlds craziest bull run for the next 2 decades
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 18:11:39'] The market is stupid so I’m gonna be more stupid and double down on the dip 🤷🏻‍♂️. They only have 200 billion in cash they must be doomed/s
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 17:13:13'] I'm going to say no, it won't bounce for awhile. Which sucks for me since I'm holding. I thought people saying it would drop to 90 were just being trolls, they might have a point. Oh well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 04:29:49'] When everyone says the stock can only go up, be cautious. Don't forget, AAPL broke $100 for the first time in July 2020. Pre Covid it had only just crested $80. It's a great company, but that doesn't mean it isn't overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 20:40:15'] It's a relatively slow decline compared to other stocks I own. I've been buying calls for July every time it goes lower.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 21:01:37'] I don't like Apple products (I live in a cold country for one) I will say however that to users inexperienced in the world of tech Apple is a must. Even if they won't be huge in 50 years they will for the next 30 as the older generation continued its dependence on their products. So ya if you ask me it's a steal right now. PE is always high in tech especially with the risk removed like in apples case. Tech is getting slammed everywhere, just use some good TA and find a recent entry point. For me I'm thinking call options 6 months out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 22:00:28'] I am total fan and wait for the right timing to jump on that train. However, what we actually see is not a correction that only subjucts APPL, its the whole tech sector that is on sale. So in the near future it maybe hard to find enough buying power on the market to shift it back into a range where p/e actually seems to be expensive compared to e.g. energystocks and with an outlook on higher t. yields.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 22:46:52'] Apple is actually now trading at its fair value of future cash flows IMO. So anything less than $118 is a deal to me on Apple. I currently hold no shares though as I have most of my money in FB and LMT.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 22:56:19'] Doh sell sell sell, but serios, its the market right now, quarter numbers are not reflected on chart. Buy and hold
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 23:04:39'] Love AAPL for the long term just not right here. They’re the largest component in QQQ and right now the Q’s are weak and over the past 2 weeks had a reversal where they went from trading above support to now trading under resistance. They’re sitting around 300 now and look to drift down to the 238 level. Down around there is where AAPL gets really interesting.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 00:03:26'] My favorit Analyst said today...inflation is coming, but how could you be that dumb to thing People will stop buying iPhones and Tablets? No they won’t stop and AAPL also had one of his best quarters in History
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 00:41:36'] Apple is seeking at a discount because institutions are offloading some shares. But it’s due to bounce back, the company is solid as can be. If you can, I’d suggest you average down until bond yields reach per-COVID levels.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 00:43:18'] Well...It will bounce back, eventually, it doesn’t have to be in the near future, it’s a gamble, good luck. There’s still plenty of room for it to correct. It was under 400 pre split and that wasn’t even that long ago
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 01:19:28'] I've been waiting for an Apple bounce since September 2, 2020. It has sucked watching it go sideways for 6+ months while EVs/hype stocks 2x or 3x. Should have dumped Apple for oil when it became clear Apple had no upside during that timeframe.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 03:58:10'] There's still a good case for Apple and most other big tech companies being way overvalued. Maybe great companies like this "deserve" it but I think there are reasons to be careful.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-24 18:26:27'] It's called hindsight... Apple almost went out of business in the late 90s. Ipod saved their ass and then Iphone. If you want to replicate the same over the next 20 years, then you need to make a bet on a company that is basically almost about to go bankrupt that will end up innovating over the next 20 years.... Investing in Apple today will probably be a safe investment and grow a bit year over year, but nowhere near the growth rate of the last 20 years... UNLESS they create a new vertical that they dominate.

DCA, DRIPS, and investing unexpected additional income for 20 years.  You might have ended up with 10% of OP's $27M projections but that is a sh\*\*ton better than $0. The compounding would have been a very reliable source of passive income...  But, 20 years is a long time and its too late to go back and do it again... hindsight IS 20/20 but no better time to start now what you regret not starting yesterday.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 22:55:30'] The way this is calculated by the way is taking the premium attached to at the money call and put options at the ask for the expiration next Friday. This is then added to the current stock price and then subtracted to come up with the weekly risk range. Generally if we fall out of this range you can consider us to be oversold or overbought. If we hit the upper or lower risk ranges at the start of the week it could set up nicely for a good risk to reward trade for the opposite direction. When important macro news occurs like Fridays poor Cpi print, you can see big deviations away from these ranges.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 13:19:53'] I have high hopes for AMD - they're branching out with their GPU to phones successfully which proves that their rDNA architecture is actually scalable and effective and work with arm CPUs. I feel like laptops are ultimately going the way of arm over x86 because they're so much more power efficient (which matters a lot to the every day user) and Microsoft is taking a major interest in getting windows 11 to run flawlessly on arm. They're also taking Apus very seriously and their performance is getting to the point where you won't even need a dedicated GPU for gaming. Their willingness to cooperate with Samsung, valve and their use in consoles gives them good potential to expand and proves that they're easy and willing to work with anyone despite the architecture.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 22:11:03'] I know people dont like to hear it, but you need some contrarian opinions instead of just hype.I dont believe in AMD.  I owned it from 7$ to 100$, but its way too overpriced now.  Its trading too close to Intel, during a chip shortage when Intel is getting many tens in billions in subsidies for its fabs, they're releasing a GPU, and its moving to a chiplet architecture more similar to AMD; which will be released before the chip shortage ends and before AMD fully capitalizes on their short lived advantage.When the fabs are operational then you have AMD with a lower margin product who buys chips from a country we arent unsure wont be taken over by China.  National security is taking stage, and that affects OEM's like Dell and HP as well.Also the investment into Xilinx makes no sense, they face a 1/3rd stock dilution to buy something overpriced that they have no means of making more profitable.  What is AMD going to do to aid them, give them TSMC's phone number?  AMD makes its money because they own the right to use x86, thats always been their only ace.  Even with that they made stupid decisions, like releasing Bulldozer while Ryzen was being produced, to seemingly make a tiny amount of money and tarnish their own brand.  For some reason the rollout of Ryzen and their GPU's were extremely slow as well, I still have no idea why they were so conservative.  They stand on the shoulders of giants, they arent a giant themselves.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 14:04:36'] I love both companies yes. And I have owned both of them for long periods of time. Both companies I expect to perform well for a long time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 13:14:18'] Nope, well yes and no, they are extremely overvalued, if they cant sustain the stimulus induced 10x multiples they are trading at they will plummet, which they are currently doing. Good companies, bad valuations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 18:29:14'] To me AMD is scary, trading at a crazy high  PE. On top of that, Intel is basically challenging every step to take them out. Is like that is there sole purpose.  I have 200 shares at 77, but I would not recommend anyone to touch it. AAPL is like a bank stock.

POST_TEXT: b"Looking at MVIS, there has been alot of internet hype about the stock. It's tough to nail down exactly why it is rallying, but I suspect its purely due to short squeeze mechanics. The shares available on iborrowdesk have shrunk to as little as 59 shares available and the fee has jumped to 59%. Considering how heavily shorted this is and how short sellers have learned how to better control these situations after GME and other meme stock run ups, the smart money is saying its going back to where it came from. \n\nI can remember playing BBBY back in August and similar mechanics were at play. MVIS has run up from about 1.82 low to now to a high of 7.27 or almost a 4 fold run up. BBBY ran from about 5 bucks to  30 for a 6 fold run up which really only stopped because Cohen sold his stake. So there may be more gas in the tank. \n\nMVIS also had a similar run from about $1.80 to $7 back in 2020 leading into 2021. From there it was able to achieve a price of 24 and several months later 28. However"

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 01:49:29'] Yea, please short with all you have, no brainer
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 01:40:51'] This is a curious post, and even more interesting comments!I’m commenting here, because I genuinely want to find out what exactly you folks base the bearish attitude on. First let me say that I am well aware of the fact that this current run is completely unsustainable. It’s a short squeeze, plain and simple. The stock is highly shorted and it was only a matter of time until something like this was going to happen. However, that’s not why I invested. Someone here mentioned that this company seems to have a die-hard following of “apes” since 2017. That is only partially true.Yes, there is a number of people who have been following the company very closely since 2017 (some even way before that). However, these are not the “apes”. They (and myself) aren’t invested in Microvision for a short squeeze. A squeeze is nice, but in the end I don’t care that much about it, other than the fact that it’s nice to see my portfolio increase in value at incredible rates. I’m aware that it will go down again. No, the reason some people have been invested since 2017 was that with the new leadership, the company took deliberate steps to create a product that it anticipated would be in high demand in the future. They focussed almost all resources on that product and began working carefully towards a set goal. In the end, they came up with a solution that, at least on paper, is better than the alternatives of the competition. Ever since I bought in, the leadership announced goals and went on to either meet those targets or even beat them. They have a lower cash burn than the competition, while having more cash on hand. They have received feedback from potential future partners and customers that their product was by far the best of the bunch, and they anticipate high-volume deals and wins this year. This year is make or break. Either they deliver or they don’t. If they don’t, I have to rethink that investment. However, so far they delivered on all their promises. I believe they will deliver on that one as well. The goal is to create a situation similarly to what exists with airbags. There is only a handful of companies in the world that make airbags. It’s a quiet market segment, but these companies completely dominate an industry that is essential to us. Microvision wants to achieve the same with LIDAR and ADAS. It took and still takes a long breath and a lot of patience, but I think it’ll pay off in the future.Now, there are a lot of proper “apes” around. They see a stock that’s currently squeezing hard, and we have a lot of people pouring into r/Mvis from r/wallstreetbets, but the people who have been there longer, and who have actually done due diligence on the company are not in it for a squeeze. MVIS has nothing in common with BBBY, GME or AMC. It actually has a product it sees demand for, and a plan mapped out for its future. So I’m genuinely asking: what makes you folks think this is a shit investment? I don’t mean this as clapping back. I’m genuinely asking for a detailed response, because I’m genuinely curious. I understand being bearish in the short term, and I understand being at least cautious in the mid- to long-run. As some here have pointed out: it’s a very competitive field and there’s no way of knowing who’ll win. All I can base my guess on is the fact that Microvision have made smart moves, produced a more cost-efficient and all around superior product, and have so far delivered on everything they have promised. So…yeah, I’m genuinely curious and in no way hostile or judgemental: what is your basis for a bearish attitude?

Buying the whole basket rather than the individual stocks might provide an easier buy-in as well, since one share of QQQ (with exposure to all 4 companies and more) could cost around $300, while buying up just one share of each could cost over 5k at current prices.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-13 09:42:03'] Depends on your level of risk tolerance. I would never recommend anyone put 100% of their retirement into individual stocks, but if you want to contribute a portion to individual holdings, have at it.Investing in individual stocks carries far more risk. While the stocks you mentioned have a very low probability of crashing completely, you still take on that burden when investing in them. $VTSAX offers enough upside with minimal risk in relation to tech stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 19:31:45'] I think it’s a great time to buy! It could even go lower next week, but this is a great entry point regardless.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 19:32:23'] Wait until after the Fed talks this upcoming week because could drop more then.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 07:02:12'] If you think it's a good opportunity and you have a long time horizon why wait? You'll never catch an exact bottom.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 21:33:08'] As long as the fundamentals didn't change for the worse, if you like those stocks at higher prices you should like them more 6% - 20% down
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 22:32:20'] AAPL is the king. as always.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 21:32:37'] Seems like everyone know exactly where we going and where is the bottom, I never herd on Market crash with certainty before, everyone bearish until they miss the bottom, and it’s happen in less the 1 second, specially from this Dip

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 05:56:18'] Buy when others are fearful…. If your time horizon is 10-20 years…. Personally I moved money to SWPPX (tracks SPY) and some target date funds on Friday at close…. My time horizon is next 20-30 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 06:25:10'] seasonality made me dodge a bullet with EFX there
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 07:33:18'] Don’t try to time it. You will be waiting to “time the bottom” perfectly and miss the reversal. Then you’ll wait for the “next decline” and have missed out completely. If you think the stock is fairly priced and are a long-term investor, buy and hold. Don’t worry about short-term fluctuations.
POST: ['2021-06-08 07:15:21'] POST TITLE: b'The curious case of AAPL'
POST_TEXT: b'Apple is currently on day two of its WorldWide Development Conference. \n\nTheyve announced some relatively significant changes to the iPhone and had a really successful year in 2020, blowing their projections out of the water. \n\nWhat should we expect for this stock over the next year? Financially, Apple has had an incredible year but the stock price has been pretty stagnant since the stock split. \n\nWhat gives?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 10:32:02'] How is no one talking about the fact that during their last earnings call, they said the semiconductor shortage is finally catching up to them and due to this they will see a $4-5billion of dip in revenue. Stock prices dont rise when revenue is expected to dip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 09:43:58'] They are weighed down heavily by their existing market value. A $2 trillion company requires a tremendous amount of capital in flow to significantly move their share price. The lack of movement drives traders and investors away from the stock - which makes sense, because if you were chasing growth, then you'd much rather invest in a company that can rise 1000%. For Apple to rise 1000%, it'd need to be worth the entire GDP of the US. Just a matter of not enough potential returns on investment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 08:01:52'] Apple and other big tech had a massive run in 2020 during the pandemic. You can't expect that to happen forever. Eventually it will break out of the trading range it has been stuck in. If you own shares, hold them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 08:46:09'] There's not going to be another year of significant increase considering 2020 was such a huge year for almost every tech based company. Things have to level out eventually
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 09:56:28'] I'm just going to hold, got the DRIP set to buy more shares over time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 12:24:30'] Have owned a few hundred shares for bout 9 years and only up 500%... ain’t going anywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 10:26:41'] I'm buying on any dips. Price targets range from $130 (Goldman Sachs) to $185 (Raymond James and Wedbush).It is rare to have a company with such a strong brand, that is growing, and pays a dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 14:35:28'] I'm bullish on both AAPL and MSFT but if somebody put a gun to my head and make me choose between the two id pick MSFT

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 14:02:37'] Just buy and hold, currently buying under $130, anticipate it will be at least $150 by year end.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 14:03:53'] >Financially, Apple has had an incredible year but the stock price has been pretty stagnant since the stock split.Maybe diminishing returns? How much bigger can the biggest market cap stock in the world still get?It takes A LOT of net buying pressure to drive a $2.1T market cap upwards. This is why large market cap stocks like these have very low volatility.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 10:01:19'] Look at Apple over the last 10-12 years.  It always rises again.  The patterns are clear.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 12:33:37'] I have been buying aapl as just a way to store cash over time that should match/beat inflation
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 10:57:56'] There's regulatory question marks as well. I think overall it's a great stock but it's definitely facing some current-day headwinds.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 23:36:39'] For the next year I think Apple needs to start accepting the fact that they may not stumble into any high growth venture that can move the stock much in the foreseeable future. They need to continue to optimize efficiency with thier core products and services. The need to realize the cash they have sitting around is being de-valuated at a very rapid pace and there is risk of higher interest rates going forward, so maybe it will be wise to chip away at the debt.I think they will continue the course with the buybacks and they will chip away at the debt a little faster. I dont think the stock price will move much in the next year but I wouldnt be surprised to see a 10-15% bump given relative "safety" and fPE assuming it is realized. At the same time, I do think that tech is in a bubble due to speculative stocks and though Apple isnt one of them, if the sector goes down, everything goes with it. Apple will weather the storm better but if it finally deflates then it might hurt the short term valuation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 11:03:45'] Significant changes? I found the keynote and state of the union to be incredibly underwhelming and the upcoming video sessions seem pretty lacklustre too.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 11:43:08'] Must be frustrating holding Apple past September 2, 2020 while EVs / other hype stocks have doubled up since then.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 07:24:07'] In order for them to have significant grow their market cap would have to expand, because they are so big already.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 11:25:27'] This...but also, why do people keep acting like AAPL hasn't had solid returns 12mm??  A year ago, it was trading at about $88 a share.    53% returns in 12 months is making investors "curious"?  Would you pass on a 52% return over the next 12 months?  Stop these posts.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 01:31:56'] Aren’t they still going through the court case with the makers of fortnite regarding their App Store policies? If they lose the case, that’s a pretty big hit to their revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-09 02:52:54'] What did you see that was "relatively significant changes to the iPhone"?I watched WWDC and did not see anything significant.  Lots of more cosmetic type stuff.  Not super surprised as think the iPhone is pretty mature at this point.But maybe I missed something?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-08 07:58:51'] I'm going to break from the typical bias of this sub that AAPL is like a savings account. News came out yesterday that apple techs lifted a woman's private sex video from her iphone and posted it to her facebook. They payed an undisclosed amount to her. Apple was supposed to be all about privacy akd security; will people think twice now about either 1) sending their iPhones into apple repair chains 2) switching to android? Apple is being sued by Epic Games for anticompetitive practices in their app store. Should they lose then their future revenue growth is threatened.There are threats to this company. The price has run up very aggressively in the past couple years, and there's room for it to fall.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 11:35:13'] List of larger regional banks I'm seeing with insider or hedge fund buys post SVB-crash, it's not an exhaustive list: TFC, ZION, SCHW, USB, GBCI, FFIN, SFBS, PNC, FITB, PACW, KEY, CFR, WAL, PB, BOKF, SSB. This shows the confidence some of the big money have in the overall sector. Note that FRC isn't on the list, and some fund owners who had positions have actually sold (Ensemble) or did not add because of uncertainty (Wedgewood, read their quarterly letter, it's great overview of the sector/timeline). Given the importance of regional banks on the health of the US economy in commercial and residential mortgage lending, I don't think it's likely that there will be such onerous regulations that it will have long term detrimental effects on the sector, maybe some token legislation targeted at the specific problems at SVB, if at all.

I used to trade BOIL and owned FCX and VALE throughout 2022, but I got out of them at $90, $42, and $18 respectively and have no plans on going back. I also owned LIT at one point but got out a while ago. Yeah, they can seem like plays that make sense when looking at macroeconomic/industry trends but there are just so many variables and so much volatility, I don’t think they make good longterm holds and I don’t trust myself enough to enter and exit at the appropriate times.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 17:54:47'] [Interesting point on the oil markets.](https://twitter.com/ALikhodedov/status/1663223453430824976) About 2 years ago in May of 2021, Citi Bank's notably bearish Ed Morse put out estimates of US production at different oil prices. [Here is the graph](https://i.imgur.com/F5OhE8T.png). May 2021 to year end saw oil average $72; 2022 saw oil average $95; 2023 YTD is $75. Note that these levels of WTI aren't even *on* the chart.Let's assume 2023 ends at averaging $70 a barrel (despite $75 YTD). We should be producing about 15.5M barrels a day based on that prediction. Where are we actually at? ....12.5 mbd. [Here is US production basically flattening out](https://i.imgur.com/qttz0Ov.png). And we are now seeing rig cuts as my comments the past few days have indicated--this doesn't hit production immediately, but rather future production. It's the completion of DUC wells that directly impacts production. Yes, production increased after an insane 2022. Do you think after H1's horrid crude oil price action oil companies are jumping to drill? With interest rates at 5%?Okay, so Currie et al. at Goldman Sachs got the oil price rally totally wrong. Here is a [timeline of his failed calls](https://i.imgur.com/ihMkzE7.png). Ed Morse's price predictions have been mostly spot on--he's calling for $76 by year end. But Morse's supply call is way off--US production is not going to save the day. If $75, $95 is not enough to get production beyond 12.5 mbd, what will it take to go hit say 15 mbd? Currie will win the longer term supply argument, in my view, and ultimately prices.

POST_TEXT: b'Critics argue that stock splits are non-events, that splitting a $400 stock 4:1 results in 4 shares trading at $100 each. Research shows splits add value.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 10:49:10'] Could this simply be because the stocks that are splitting are the ones beating the market on average?
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 09:01:38'] Reminder that Apple also did a 7 for 1 split in 2014 when their share price was ~$650 and its approaching the same level already.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 10:31:35'] My main criticism towards the study is whether such information is priced in before the actual split. Did the past stock gain 15% in a week on announcing a stock split, and then proceed to beat the market by those figures?

AAPL wouldn't split if they were at $80/share.So while AAPL may still continue to go up it won't be due to the split itself, it's just already got a lot of momentum behind it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 10:50:23'] Tiny retail investors who are able to finally jump in and buy a full share with their $120 after the split aren't going to be moving the market on a nearly $2 tril company. Yea retail traders may be able to move the market on a smaller stock like a Hertz or Nikola, but Apple is the largest company in the world.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 12:43:00'] People keep saying it’s a 4:1 split so it’ll be $100 a share.  It’s more than $400 right now, surely the split means the shares are already worth more than $100? Wouldn’t it more realistically split to (at time of writing 445/4) $111.25?

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 08:10:41'] They keep saying AAPL is over priced. They been saying that for years. They keep saying wait for a pullback but at a 4-1 stock split would put the price at $100-$110. Yall think a pull back would cause the price to go down to the $60-$80 range? I just don't see that happening.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 11:09:24'] Stocks split because their price is growing. Stocks that grow fast in price before a split have a big chance to keep growing after split. The growth after the split does not have to do anything with the split.Correlation != causation

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 19:05:09'] I'd say one of the main drivers for Apple right after the stock split will be new investors eying the cheap shares not really knowing why it's so cheap.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 19:47:21'] How about this. If you bought before the stock price hit $400 you’re doing good. Hell if you buy at $450 you’re still doing good if you’re buy/hold. Everything depends on your time horizon.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 06:07:55'] That is looking at it backwards, they don’t do well because they split, they split because they are companies that have already done well, and presumably continued to do well. Stock splits aren’t non events, they help to maintain the investability of a stock, both for small investors, and for the sake of 100 share batches for options, but behind a little media coverage, they are events that don’t matter much. Investors that can’t afford a share because it’s $450, don’t move markets much, and most big institutions that are dealing with options, aren’t going to be prohibited by $45k batches.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 06:22:29'] It's easier to play around with options for a $100 stock vs a $400 stock.  This creates volatility that some companies don't want.With so many new traders on RH,  FOMO buys will most likely to push the stock price up right after the split.  However, the same people who FOMO buy are also the people who panic sell.  So they'll sell when the China-US trade war gets worse especially when China retaliates.If you are in it for the long term, evaluate your entry and exit positions base on the company fundamentals.  The market gives and the market takes away.  For every APPL, AMZN, FB, there is an IBM, GM, Sears, Exxon (at one point it was 6% of the S&P like AAPL is today), and the entire list of companies associated with US steel industry.On the other extreme, we have Eron, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Andersen consultant etc.

Each time it goes up to $400 or some crap and they split again. It’s a LONG term investment. Buy in now, it splits 4 ways, you keep holding and it keeps growing.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 16:56:23'] Except now with most brokers offering sliced shares the more affordable argument doesn’t hold up however qty of shares is very good if you are an active trader and want to let the broker borrow your stocks and them pay you or sell options contracts to collect premium. Especially on good named companies. 25 shares will get you to that 100 so that’s one good argument. I think Apple has hit its top til the split. We will then see more people file into it but be careful around earnings or other events. Once a vaccine comes into play a lot of rotation will occur. Apple is def a good stock to hold. Wish Amazon and them would split.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 18:40:25'] Different circumstances in 2020.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 20:25:50'] This is not applicable to 2020 where entry traders can buy fractional shares. The whole idea of a stock split is that it brings in shmucks like me who have 13k in my robinhood account.This actually makes Apple more expensive to add to ETFs, since they are charged a price per share, which could in theory make it less appealing.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 20:26:20'] But now with the capability of buying fractional shares, doesn't it make your last point moot?

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 21:07:02'] This is some terrible advice. If you're investing based on stock split, you are not "investing"!

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 23:55:36'] You should also consider the effects of DOW induced selloffs. Using someone else's numbers, "The 4-1 split will reduce Apple's weighting in the Dow from about 11.2% to around 2.7%.". This is because DOW is price-weighted and AAPL is currently the highest weighted stock in the index.This should not be considered as financial advice, but I wouldn't invest in AAPL just for the potential positive effects, which may or may not be included in the price already.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 05:34:34'] Buying a stock on the basis of a stock split is silly. Stock splits do not create value, as they have zero effect on cash flows. If you want to buy AAPL, go for it, but make sure it makes sense on the basis of expected future cash flows.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 18:52:09'] This study is pretty old. And considering the ease of access to fractional share trading through things like Robinhood I don't necessarily see stock splitting behaving the same way as in 2003. However, from a psychological perspective we do prefer to make purchases in whole numbers so maybe that'll be a driving force for some to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 22:30:05'] No one noticed OP is basing his views on an almost 20 year old study?!  You keep on buying bud.  AAPL hasn't had any innovations in a long while, I bet you're going to be wishing you chose to use relevant and recent data in your decisions though.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 17:03:50'] I hope this doesn't become a trend. More shares mean more commissions. The only people this benefits are tiny retail traders. Any serious investor isn't going to struggle to buy a $400 stock. It's almost like they're trying to position their stock to benefit from the current Robinhood FOMO for large cap tech stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 22:36:18'] Wow this is stupid and the comments urging everyone to buy apple with both fists is alarming to say the least.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 14:04:31'] This is retarded.Correlation does not equal causation. Only stocks that are doing well do splits. Generally ones that were going parabolic did it the most back during the tech bubble.You could have titled this post “Buy AAPL, it’s a good company” and it would be more relevant than the split.Also as fractional shares exist now, point three is moot. Even if it did matter, small retail is not gonna move a near 2trillion market cap company.You should be ashamed of this postStill, buy AAPL, but because they are an amazing company. Not because they did a split

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 14:25:21'] I’ve owned AAPL since the iPod days, up between 2400-3200% (not a typo) depending on which lots you consider. While future performance is not guaranteed to match this, AAPL is a hold for life stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 13:30:38'] I think it depends on your timeframe for holding and how close you watch the market. If you’re going to hold it for 20 years, I don’t think a $10 difference in price is a big deal. If you just want a temporary place to put your cash, I would wait for a pull back. September is a seasonally weak time for tech stocks, so waiting a few weeks might get you a better price.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 14:51:12'] AAPL has risen to above its previous split price in its past 5 splits within 4 yrs.  Buy and hold and buy some more.  AAPL is a cash machine!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 13:25:43'] Just my opinion but I would just buy and hold. You won't time it right and if it is rising in price you shouldn't sell it anyway. People generally sell the winners and hold their losers. It's a terrible strategy. You also won't know when to expect a correction and the stock could rise from here, correct 10% and you could still come out behind depending non how much it rises before it corrects.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 17:14:38'] Never bet against AAPL
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 17:57:15'] A way to compromise this is to put in half of your planned investment into the market right now, then use the other half as a reserve pool when different stocks pullback. So if APPL goes up, you managed to get some money into the stock and can't be totally left behind, and if you can't get the rest of the planned investment in there, you have other strong candidates that you'll catch on pullbacks.If you have a portfolio of \~10-15 stocks, in my 4 years of experience they're rarely all moving up all at the same time, and I feel better at spreading out my chances to continue to average into positions.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 15:13:55'] I know this may get hate because it’s not “it’s AAPL hold” but I trimmed a sizeable portion of my AAPL position after being up 40% and rolled that cash into other plays which are currently netting me higher gains. I love the company but based on absolutely no fundamental or technical analysis I just feel like it is ripe for a correction in the near future. I’m sure they will continue to be great as years go by but I treat apple as my cash reserve due to its stability and sell when I need cash for other plays.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 15:14:27'] Sell a CSP on AAPL get the price you want or collect free money if not. Cash sitting won’t make you money. I literally Sell a CSP on AAPL every month for free cash and I rarely get assigned and when I do it’s AAPL. Right after I start Selling CCs. Rinse, Wash and Repeat. Beats buy and Hold AAPL every year I’ve done  it for 12 years. Worked especially well in 2014-2017 when AAPL went literally no where
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 20:37:08'] AAPL investors are loyal and solid. It would take a major overall market correction or a mishap within Apple for it to really drop.  If you want Apple, you need to buy apple. Be content with a few percent dip, if you want the feel good. This upcoming week could present an opportunity. Buy waiting for Apple to just dip for no reason is like waiting for the united states to have a genuine political discussion. Full disclosure: I don’t own any. I like other stuff and there is too much opportunity out there right now.  Will put some in my blue chip account whenever the market eventually crashes. Not holding my breath.

I don't yet own any shares of AAPL and I bought the contracts to lock in the price in the hopes to exercise all of them. Now I'm unsure of the best strategy as my liquid has dried up and my portfolio has not performed to expectations. So now sorting out my best plan of action and your post is relevant. I'm thinking of selling 2 of the contracts and exercising the other 2  and want to (of course) sell the contracts at their peak.    Thoughts anyone?

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 20:06:34'] IMO 20% cash position is good to hold in general. Opportunity cost is real! Basically when there's an urgent investment you want to make (maybe a dip) you can use that cash instantly. Then when you start adding more money to your portfolio, increase the cash position first before buying new stocks. Just my personal philosophy, 20% may even be a bit high though - if you like the general idea play around with the numbers to your taste
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 22:51:39'] DCA over a 3-6 month period. Or DCA into the QQQ as it’s 10% AAPL and 10% MSFT and gets you exposure to many other great tech companies. Full disclosure I have 100 QQQ, 150 AAPL and 100 MSFT.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 23:44:34'] Why not both?Imagine this - You wait for a correction and it comes in let's say 1-2 weeks. But it ends up going down to 155.  You end up buying the stock at higher price than right now.Buy a portion now to take advantage of any increase right now, and if it corrects then just put more money in and take advantage of that too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-25 14:05:12'] I think this is the overall consensus on AAPL since I spent an inordinate amount of time studying it: AAPL is slowly phasing into more of a value stock than a growth stock. WITH THAT BEING SAID, we shouldn’t look for much immediate spikes in growth. But when it comes to the bigger picture long term, it’s current value is very good. You could say that for a lot of stocks, but specifically when it comes to MSFT and AAPL, these are damn good prices.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-25 14:42:57'] I bought, today, 3 Call option contracts of AAPL. Strike price: 120$, exp. 07/16/2021 Break Even Price: 132.40$.I feel it has a lot of great potential. The chances that it ends out of the money are very low in my opinion. Between 130$ & 140$ is the most plausible + it might print money if it goes above 150$.Wish me good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-25 15:35:03'] If it follows its historical stock growth trend then the 'fair' price is about $85; that doesn't account for things like low interest rates, the M1 chip and 5G supercycle, increased margins from a move to a subscription model, increasing smartphone market share, etc. I think it's a bit overvalued right now, more than AMZN and MSFT, but with good reason--it has a very bright future, and a pristine balance sheet. The valuation presents a problem, though--in the last few years its revenue growth has been slow, and it's managed its stock growth through buybacks, something it can't justify at its current valuation. At least it's nowhere near as overvalued as several of the other small/mid-cap tech stocks (or cyclicals with negative P/E's). No one has ever lost money going long on AAPL, long-term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 20:28:25'] Ah yes, another method of having people irresponsibly acquire things they actually cannot afford. Because putting customers into debt is fun! Seriously, our nation is plagued right now with irresponsible people trying to live above their means. People can’t afford groceries but everyone in the house has iPhones. Can’t pay bills, but they sure as shit have an iPad. This is just another way to encourage irresponsible spending. Instead of splitting the cost up into four payments.. just save up that money and don’t pay any interest or fees on it. It’s called patience and responsibility. This is why our country is screwed up financially. People refuse to live within their means.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 20:43:38'] For those curious… They’re making money whether they try to act like they’re not. Everything you buy, they’re getting SOMETHING. you pay it all? Great. You don’t? Even better! Now you’re in debt and most companies would charge late fees extra. But the best part comes when they get to sell that debt to debt collectors. Either way this is literally designed to put people in debt. Stop living above your means people. Instead of paying four payments.. just out that money away and save up. Do you really think APPLE is doing people a favor here? No. It’s a get money scheme. They know people will spend far above their means and end up owing more. You’re incentivized to purchase above your means. “Oh you can buy that couch instead of that cheaper one, because you get to pay it off. Well, since we can make payments let’s get those expensive lamps too”.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 10:50:43'] I think today Apple is somewhat to expensive, I wouldn’t buy simply because I do think the market will go through a big change. Not only Apple but all tech companies will see a big shake once the shortage of semiconductors levels put in a year, maybe 2. With Intel and TSMC(this one been the main supplier for apple chips) announcement of 30-40B on fab space in Arizona for 5nm fabs and government pushing for trillions in development, I think we will hit a point where supply is greater than demand in like 4-5 years which will make US supply chain more independent in this field but will also hit the market in terms of having too much capacity that we don’t really need. This will be pivotal, the supply will sure become more useful in the future but short term it might affect us in a negative way. I think this will hit all big tech companies, Apple included, but Apple also has the advantage of moving to ARM earlier than any other company of its size and having already amazing integration. I think this will make them recover faster companies others, they simply will have already adapted to where the market wants to go, since IMO ARM is the future of computer architecture. TLDR: 2 years for supply to level, 4-5 for us to see too much supply and not enough demand, and then recovery. I already own Apple shares, I wouldn’t buy today unless I’m think in short term, but I would buy in the future after this transition periods.PS. I’m not a financial advisor, I’m a EE & Materials Science person, My comment is based on my industry experience, education, trends, and what I personally believe is the future pf semiconductors and technology market.

They have their pick of the litter on the supply side in China with allocation and bespoke production, with insane economies of scale (ask anyone of their vendors.. Goertek, Quanta, Foxconn.. nobody is writing bigger checks with greater demands of their suppliers than Apple). Cash prepayments. Huge volumes. The luxury to try and fail and recalibrate.When I think of amazing execution in services, software, and hardware, there's no one I know who does it better than Apple. It's one of the largest digital infrastructure companies for the world. It's Apple's world, and everyone else is just trying to chip away at it. This ground-level of dominance is extremely hard to unseat.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 07:38:25'] As always, it will be about guidance. I am sure Apple will crush the top and bottom line as they have been for the last few quarters.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 10:19:49'] It is a great company. That’s why it is the most valuable company in the world!
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 10:39:58'] the current trend is, it doesn't matter if earnings are good or not, algos control the stock price and everything tanks after earnings
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 10:49:18'] my bet is that it's gonna drop after earnings no matter what. its been happening with every tech stock. its already run up a few % the last few weeks so im my mind a good earnings has already been priced in
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 13:04:53'] Buy and hold forever.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 13:05:14'] What time can we expect results?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 16:33:48'] I am just grateful they didn't tank the moment earnings began lol. Probably gonna look for a good chance to grab another share over the next week or so.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 10:15:50'] Will probably dip slightly if they mention anything about the chip shortages

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 09:11:20'] Apple hasn't innovated in years.  Latest innovation? Copy tiles.It is not gonna sell well.  Their products are too good.  Don't need replacements for years.

POST: ['2022-02-02 08:23:11'] POST TITLE: b'A quick price action review as to how TSLA and AAPL performed when they announced their stock splits'
POST_TEXT: b"With Google's recent stock split announcement, I got curious as to the specifics of how previous large cap tech stocks performed when they announced their stock splits leading up to the actual execution.\n\nSpecifically, the ones I remember were AAPL and TSLA. So here are the results:\n\n**TSLA** [announced](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split) on Aug 12, 2020. Trading to begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on August 31, 2020.\n\nDuring the 19 days, it moved 51.23% - https://i.imgur.com/Q4zTd8G.png\n\n**AAPL** [announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/30/apple-stock-split-announced.html) on Jul 30, 2020. Trading to begin on a stock split-adjusted basis on August 31, 2020.\n\nDuring the 31 days, it moved 24.01% - https://i.imgur.com/lhLvvOq.png\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you think we will see [similar price action](https://i.imgur.com/5lMFaet.png) with GOOGL?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 10:40:25'] It was also during one of the craziest bull runs. Mathematically, stock-split doesn’t matter, but practically, more people can afford the shares and options are still traded per lot

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 14:48:23'] Stocks tend to increase after forward splits all else being equal.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 09:09:00'] As much as I'd love it, and as much as it'd actually make sense (YouTube apparently isn't priced properly in Google, it made more than Netflix and apparently the way things are priced in there, you're getting YouTube for cheap), I don't think there's much chance at all that Google trades $4k before splitting.Best case is probably that it trades $3300-3500 before splitting, and that is probably going to be dependent on 13700 being a panic low that sticks for a while for the Nasdaq-100.If it does trade $4k, I'll take some of mine off (I have 15 shares at a $1126ish cost basis) and will ride the rest for the rest of time as long as all goes well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 12:03:14'] Two things:1) The labor Market will stay very tight and unemployment low because of significant demographic issues2) a sustained and ubiquitous lack of supply of housing will mean that house/rent prices are never going to go down until something significant changes (eg. New regulation)Both of these will mean that the Fed’s ability to reduce inflation will be significantly hindered and inflation may be higher for longer and this will not be good for stocks. Agree with this? Disagree? Why?

I am going to stick with commodity producing companies amid this market uncertainty. Also the Fed is going to pause rate hikes. A bad side affect about the Fed trying to kill demand is the Fed is also killing supply with increasing interest rates and killing jobs. Manufacturing & construction are down. So for everyone that thought inflation was caused by supply chain breakdowns and not money printing; what happens to prices when supply also goes back down?  J-Pow better kill jobs faster than the falling supply of manufactured goods.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 10:06:06'] Why playing the VIX has been terrible: Even though VIX is less than 18, VIX futures the next month is 20.5, 15% higher. The month after that is 22, 24% higher. VIX and options premium is already predicting more volatility coming, so there is a high cost to buy the VIX at 18. What that means for something like UVXY is holding costs of 1.5x15% = 23% per month if VIX stays at 18 and doesn't move up, you only start making money if VIX moves up to over 20 within a month and over 22 within 2 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:23:55'] Apple is only 45% of their investment portfolio in publicly traded stocks. They own a shit ton of other private assets and entire businesses.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:27:50'] It’s a bit more complicated than that. 45% of Berkshire’s portfolio isn’t in Apple. ~40% of his *publicly-traded* portfolio is in Apple. Berkshire also owns many private companies as well. Many of them are household names like Fruit of the Loom, Geico, Duracell, Dairy Queen, etc.Others are huge companies that aren’t household names like BNSF (1 of the 7 Class I freight railways), GenRe, energy companies, oil pipelines, etc. They also own many “small businesses” like local jewelry stores, a furniture market, and a newspaper in Omaha, Nebraska (Berkshire’s HQ)https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Berkshire_Hathaway#Operating_subsidiaries
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 19:11:24'] He just answered this question, and said he’d own more of apple if he could. He says it’s the best business by far and there’s no reason not to own as much as possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 20:58:51'] Warren Buffet said outright that he is not a fan of diversification via individual stock purchases.His philosophy:If you want to diversify, buy a low cost ETF. But if you know what you are doing and understand a company, their business, their market and their risk and come to the conclusion that they trade significantly below intrinsic value + margin of error -- then go in big. You probably don't have that level of understanding for 10-20 companies.So the question is: do you understand the company you hold better than the market? If so, then what you are doing is ok.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:19:30'] It wasn't 45% when he bought it, it grew to become 45%. To sell now would be a waste since he'd have to pay taxes and find a new place to put the money. Warren won't sell until he thinks Apple is no longer a good holding or if he needs the money for something else (unlikely as Berk has a ton of cash).
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:00:10'] It is risky. But Buffett and Munger have run concentrated portfolios before. GEICO used to be over 50% of Buffett's net worth. The actual risk is dependent on their analysis of AAPL. Warren seems confident in the investment, often talks about how he wishes they could own the whole company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:57:39'] If you have something that you think is the best thing that could possibly exist, would you sell it and buy something else? Everything else despite exhaustive research is inferior, so what would you do with the money? Berkshire has exceptional profit in this business and they’re raking in mega dividends amd getting huge returns. Don’t pull your flowers to water your weeds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:16:26'] Personally, I am totally for globally diversified and factor ETFs with regular rebalancing.But half my net worth is in a single company as I bought it for cheap and had enormous gains. Even now, I think I will "never" sell it. and I still read and watch every single detail about it. Either you stockpick like Buffet and put the work into it. Or you diversify via ETFs. But if you own 20 or so stocks, you just as well can go for the ETF.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 20:59:26'] Buffet and Munger have both said they don't believe in diversification. They'd have gone over 100% in one company at times if it was possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:33:55'] Because WB generally owns enough equity in these businesses that he can exert some control over them - Berkshire Hathaway acts kind of like a publicly traded PE firm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:57:03'] Find advice from credible resources to learn how to invest in your tax bracket or hire a financial advisor.  The advice these moguls give only really works when you have a lot of money like them.  I had all my money in 1 stock from 2020-Now and have seen a greater ROI than I probably would’ve gotten investing only 15% max in blue chip stocks during the same time period.  I risked it all and it’s paid off so far.  You need to grow your money to throw your money.  There are 2 types of investors, those who risk it all to get to the top and those who steadily climb their way there.  Both are respectable paths to financial security and you have to figure out which one you’re more comfortable doing.  The best decision is an informed decision.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:07:54'] For your average investor it’s risky. For Warren Buffet, Charles Munger, and the leadership team they’ve built to take over after they’re gone, it’s a calculated risk. Based on whatever analysis they’ve run, a 45% concentration is an acceptable risk adjusted return

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 10:46:47'] Many retail investors are exposed to dangers that they either ignore or misunderstand, or they overestimate their own knowledge and competence. They rely too much on mathematical formulas and too little on sound judgment in their own emotional biases. This leads them to buy high-grade stocks at very high prices when the market and the economy are booming, and to sell them at very low prices when the market and the economy are depressed. They do not appraise the intrinsic value of the stocks before buying or selling them, but rather follow their whims and biases. They will twist or disregard any factor to make the stocks appear cheap or expensive, such as using a higher or lower interest rate, projecting a faster or slower growth rate, or anything else that justifies their wish to buy or sell the stock. That's the face of fundamental analysis in retail domain.The main lesson is: spread your portfolio among 20 to 30 stocks and avoid extreme actions

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-27 17:37:09'] It's called asset allocation.Instead of having cash sit idle, Apple created more shareholder value.\#1, the cash was used to purchase marketable securities which as they matured past one year, are no longer considered 'short-term marketable securities.' Apple bought U.S. treasury bonds with them. They also invest in other treasuries across the world. It's not like the cash suddenly disappeared. They're just being used to generate a higher return through other investment vehicles.\#2, they increased dividends. Last year, they paid out nearly $15 billion in dividends to investors.\#3, last year, Apple spent nearly $90 billion in stock buybacks. The past decade, they spent nearly $500 billion. That's where their money is going to. Buying outstanding shares, creating more shareholder value, and making use of their cash. Their profits are locked up in other countries to avoid corporate taxes. It makes sense from this perspective.\#4, Apple gets low interest debt from banks. Lower than the U.S. treasury rate. It's like if you had $1,000 and you can either put it in U.S. treasury for a 5% yield and then borrow the $1,000 from a bank for an interest rate of 3%. Why wouldn't you borrow and then deduct interest expense? That's why Apple's current liabilities have gone up (which will affect their current ratio). They have been borrowing money and using their cash stack for buybacks and marketable securities.The thing about ratios is they are formula-based. You need to figure out where the money went and this is why you compare their overall balance sheet and also check their 8-K and other additional info disclosed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-27 17:13:21'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-27 17:13:43'] You need to divide the price by annual earnings per share and not quarterly. Which makes the PE close to 20. Current ratio speaks little as you don’t specify what is the nature of current assets and liabilities. For instance, a large portion of current debt is a lot more alarming than deferred revenue. Most of these ratios are good indicators but also have a lot of subjectivity to them.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-29 16:36:28'] AAPL went from $100 to $500 while EPS went from $9 to $13. I read that 2019 Q4 was not so good . The only reason they have better numbers is because of the lock down.Iphone12 had worst reception ever by Wall Street. They depend too heavily on the Chinese market and things could get bad very easy .If WeChat gets banned about 80% of Chinese say they would move to Android. Last week Tesla was forced to recall 50,000 cars on what they thought was an unjustified decision by Chinese government. Right now French cheeses taken off the shelves of stores or markets in muslim countries . Things can turn very quickly. Years ago AAPL had a similar scare years ago.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-14 08:33:56'] I see so many people saying "Never sell Apple". These people just completely ignore the valuation. It's at a 32 P/E after a 60% (!!!) bump in covid earnings, which is likely to be an enormous drag on earnings growth the coming years. Street forecasts 5% CAGR into 2024. It's very overvalued as is. Doesn't mean you can't possibly make money but your safety cushion has been severely thinned at this valuation.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-14 14:53:48'] If you’re hearing about it all over social media it’s time to sell, I made a prediction on tradingview in October last year that apple would run to $180 once it broke out of its consolidation which it did- so maybe my opinion is a little biased towards being right. My other reason is because large cap stocks have been seeing a pump recently- Tesla Nvidia now apple have all done the same which is strange cause they all pumped directly after the other starting falling from highs. Their earnings have actually been getting worse each quarter as well which is opposite of what you would think from price action. I believe it will dip back to the $120-$130 range next

However, the probability of you winning the market by timing is lower than time in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-14 17:20:25'] from what i've heard apple hit the three trillion dollar mark at around $180 stock price and a lot of people were waiting for that to sell off. from what i've learned it's a fairly overpriced stock not too overpriced, but it is a little.  According to the one month moving average convergence devergence graph its a hold coming close to crossing as a sell, if you look at the one week graph it's a sell, if i were you i would have sold at $180 if i were making call options, you can always hold apple stocks though, you will be fine. but that's just my personal opinion and i'm not giving any financial advice.

Not to mention with all the supply chain constraints causing a delay in production and a fear of rising interest rates could really cause some P/E compression. I’ve taken profits on AAPL at $180 and will wait until after the FOMC meeting tomorrow before thinking of buying back in.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 15:30:37'] india is very price sensitive market and 400+$ phones made only 3% of total smartphone market. Earlier apple didn't really take india seriously indian premium smartphone market was dominated by OnePlus. Plus iphones were produced in China and costed a heavy import duty. Few years ago apple started manufacturing in India and got to save on the import duty, this allowed them to be competitive at pricing, especially during sales. Plus average price of Android smartphones started going up. Fall of OnePlus and premium image of apple has allowed it to become most popular expensive phone and do record sales here. Hence apple has started taking india seriously due to the growth potential.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 17:25:00'] Pretty much every company that becomes a mega cap or blue chip tends to start out as an IPO with decent publicity and the underwriters being established big banks. The companies that “make it big” have access to the best possible channels for funding. Their “small cap phase” was private and had solid VC backing. You pretty much never see a public micro cap or small cap make that transition and grow into a mega cap, because there’s probably a good reason they didn’t get that type of backing from established players.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 09:42:28'] There will definitely be consolidation in streaming, but I see Paramount as the one that is most likely to be bought by a larger player. Netflix is too big to be swallowed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 10:58:06'] Apple is all about making high quality products for their loyal consumer fanbase sucked into their ecosystem. Apple TV makes quality shows over quantity so they wi not buy a company that specialises in pumping quantity over quality

New shows are going to be what drives Apple TV and they can spend money on creating content not buying Netflix if that is the direction they want to go.  Also it is rumored that Apple is going to win the NFL Sunday ticket which will drive a bunch of new subscribers so it is too early to say it hasn't been a clear success.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 11:04:25'] Abs not.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 11:23:50'] Not a shareholder, but i agree with others that i don't think buying Netflix would make sense for Apple. Why:* Netflix has a huge user base. But Apple already got this thorugh their ecosystem, similar to Amazon through Prime. So that is something they don't need to pay for. And imo part of Apples success is also the lock in effect and synergies they have through said ecosystem. But i really don't see the average Netflix subscriber convert to Apple hardware just because they bought it.* Content. Existing IP with the potential to expand on it as well as building a base to keep people hooked is what Apple lacks. But so does Netflix, at least relatively speaking compared to many other streaming services. Since everybody is doing their own streaming service now and pulling their content, Netflix has to spend a lot on creating new shows and movies. Also where as Apple seems to go for quality over quantity (in line with their brand), Netflix pretty much does the opposite. Sub par content imo could even hurt Apple more than help.* Netflix even after the drop is a large company. I don't think Apple really does those kind of take overs, they usually just do their own thing or if anything go for smaller companies.So basically Netflix imo is the opposite of what Apple wants. I am not sure if they even want to buy something right now or are fine with the slow and steady growth. But if they do, then they'd want something like Amazon buying MGM. Smallish and with memorable IP like James Bond.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 12:00:33'] Apple already has their own streaming service so I don’t see the reason to acquire them. Granted if they were having problems growing say Apple TV it would make sense and probably be a good play.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 13:01:36'] If Apple is ever going to make a large purchase it will be to buy Disney.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 19:37:49']  Nope. I don’t think it’s likely and I’m happy about that.  I’m quite happy with Apple’s low key and slow approach to building their library.  They had a slow start but some recent shows (Severance, Pachinko) have been killing it.  CODA winning Best Movie Oscar was a huge win too. I think we’re starting to see an improvement in the average quality.

Rigs targeting crude declined by 11 to 575 this week, according to data released Friday by Baker Hughes Co. It’s the biggest weekly drop since September 2021.

This is 'up by more than a fifth from what it had forecast in October.' Here's a [table of break-even prices by OPEC country](https://i.imgur.com/AammJke.png). "The assessment aligns with the view of Bloomberg Economics, which estimates Saudi Arabia needs an oil price above $80 and perhaps closer to $100 to meet all spending commitments and ensure the stability of the social contract between the government and the citizens."

Why is this important? As [another thread](https://twitter.com/econ_713/status/1657883709238829057) from a different author points out, "The physical oil mkt is slow-moving. A tanker loaded in KSA [Saudi Arabia] will take ~44 days to reach the Houston Ship Channel. Thus, cuts that ‘start’ on May 1st will not impact data until mid-June. This leads inexperienced pundits to prematurely pronounce that the cuts ‘aren’t working’ or won’t matter. These are amateur takes, & the key data to be watching [right now] is *loadings.* And these data confirm that the cuts are real & will print mid-June.

Why does this matter? If prices start to rise, "any large gains in oil prices could unleash as much as $40 billion worth of buying in US crude and Brent alone from trend-following commodity trading advisers" and shorts turn long.- [Visual from Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/energy-oil-gas-stock-picks-roundtable-f0171204?mod=hp_HERO): Energy sector with [historically small](https://i.imgur.com/zyVDTYh.png) share of S&P 500. ## Global Demand- [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-20/hedge-funds-ultra-bearish-oil-bets-signal-us-recession-angst?srnd=markets-vp) on refining demand + inventories: "Refineries are processing the most crude for this time of year since the pandemic began. Air travel is rising just about everywhere, and gasoline demand in the US is now at the highest level since December 2021. At the same time, fuel inventories are below seasonal norms for gasoline and diesel in the US, and OPEC+ cuts and Canadian wildfires have limited crude supply." - IEA raising forecasts via [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/iea-says-oil-price-downturn-ignores-looming-supply-crunch-2023-05-16/): "Prices were pressured lower by muted industrial activity and higher interest rates, which, combined have led to recessionary scenarios gaining traction," the Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil report. "The current market pessimism, however, stands in stark contrast to the tighter market balances we anticipate in the second half of the year, when demand is expected to eclipse supply by almost 2 million barrels per day (bpd)." The IEA raised its forecast for global oil demand by 200,000 bpd to 102 million bpd, noting that China's recovery after the lifting of COVID-19 curbs had surpassed expectations with demand reaching a record 16 million bpd in March."

Here is [me in September 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x762ow/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_sep/ind1cfn/) warning that the gloom over European natural gas was extremely overdone. Indeed, prices have [tanked](https://www.ft.com/content/ba8f7a30-954b-4620-b8f1-40de771e77fb), with "European natural gas prices fell back into their normal trading range for the first time since the start of the energy crisis on Thursday, falling below €30 per megawatt hour to reach the lowest level since June 2021. The price of benchmark TTF fell as low as €29.75/mwh, down more than 8 per cent on the day, to levels last seen before Russia started squeezing Europe’s pipeline gas supplies ahead of its invasion of Ukraine." Just [look at this chart](https://i.imgur.com/DsGSL4T.png) from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-18/europe-gas-futures-fall-below-30-for-first-time-since-june-2021#xj4y7vzkg).- Me in November pushing back against [imminent skyrocketing of energy prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ynb88z/winter_is_comingenergy/iv8ffwc/)- [Me in late December](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zwmp18/putin_bans_sale_of_russian_oil_to_the_west/j1wvci8/) arguing that the threat that Russia can sabotage oil markets and send them to new highs is gone.- [Me in July 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wa0lut/blackrock_energy_crisis_hits_europe_stay_away/ihydv8w/) arguing that European stocks are very cheap and (by extension) suggesting not to sell out of or avoid Europe. And this was when energy prices were through the roof. The Europe ETF $VGK is up 14% since then, the German $DAX and FTSE 100 would hit all time highs. Japan too, recently. - But I am generally bullish for the long term, as [argued in this October comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ygqxb1/5y_perspective_on_global_markets/iuapp8i/).- Am I positioned for this thesis?

In general I got wrong how much crude would fall, but the one claim I was consistently right on is that natural gas markets would tank. Both Henry Hub (US) and TTF (Europe). And tank they did.- My start of year predictions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zzwrcp/rstocks_2022_roundup_looking_ahead_at_2023/j2gvesp/) on the broader market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 13:57:12'] I'd appreciate someone's input on the discrepancy in valuations reported by Morningstar with that of an ETF's fund documents. Consider [AVDV, an actively managed Avantis fund](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf/) that tracks small cap value companies outside of the US and in developed markets. It is extremely diversified within its segment, [with 1336 companies](https://i.imgur.com/bE0NH1A.png) and [none with more than 0.75% weight](https://i.imgur.com/Au4jmmc.png). The weighted average market cap is $1.7B--where by weighted they multiply each market cap by its weight in the ETF, not simply averaging the market caps. This is stated in [their definition](https://i.imgur.com/g4UPsTi.png). They go on to calculate similar weighted valuation metrics:- Weighted Average Book/Market 1.06x [i.e., B/P]- Weighted Average Profits/Book of 0.32x. [i.e. E/B]- An implied E/P ratio of (1.06)*(0.32) = 0.34- An implied **P/E ratio** of 1 / (0.34) = **2.94**- An implied **P/B ratio** of 1 / 1.06 = **0.94**.On the other hand, [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/avdv/portfolio) states that the **P/E of AVDV was 7.16** and the **P/B is 0.84**. [Here are all their valuation metrics.](https://i.imgur.com/zpIuixB.png)Why is Morningstar giving a P/E ratio that is 2.4x higher than the fund documents? Is this because Morningstar doesn't do any weighting and literally just averages the P/E of every company in the ETF no matter its weight? Does it have to do with the treatment of negative earnings companies? Simultaneously, Morningstar has a P/B ratio of 0.84 which is *lower* than the Avantis document's implied 0.94 ratio. So Morningstar has a more expensive P/E ratio but cheaper P/B ratio.Both sources indicate this sector and ETF is extremely cheap, but I'm very interested in if it is as cheap as implied by Avantis.

POST_TEXT: b"I've got about 5.5% AAPL and 11.1% MSFT.  I'm thinking of adding some CRM since I dont have any and don't see much appreciation in AAPL at least short term.\n\nMy AAPL shares in question are in my ROTH so no taxes.  Should I cut AAPL to 4% or so and diversify into CRM?\n\nI notice CRM at the top if many growth funds and indexes, below AAPL and MSFT of course."
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 17:38:15'] Nope. Where were you when CRM was in turdville all year? It was literally the dog of the Dow from November 2020-September 2021.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:27:16'] CRM is a good business. At 118 PE, I doubt it's good enough to justify selling AAPL for it, considering that even if iPhone and iMac revenue stopped growing, they are increasing their services revenue like crazy, and they have barely started monetizing their cult-like ecosystem.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:00:52'] I have more Apple and Microsoft then salesforce but I have a hefty amount of each! I work with salesforce so I wanted to have a decent size of my portfolio in it. Idk if I’d sell Apple for it but having all 3 is my plan.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 17:57:00'] You can diversify and add CRM in a Dollar Cost Averaging way so that you can get CRM at different prices.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:37:49'] I’m bullish on CRM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 16:16:54'] I have both. CRM has had better revenue and earnings growth than AAPL over the last few years, and is not as vulnerable to supply issues as AAPL is. However, it's trading at a very high multiple right now. I don't see either company as undervalued, and I doubt you'll see much growth in CRM in the near term (but who knows...). I think being overweight on CRM is a good idea, but I'd recommend DCA'ing into it, because it may not go anywhere for a while.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 16:56:19'] I own all 3.  Don't sell AAPL.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 13:06:17'] AAPL and MSFT are both in my never sell category. I would try and get some funds elsewhere, but if you think it will trade sideways, go ahead.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 11:41:24'] You’re buying at the top. Last time it hit its ATH, it fell for like 9 months.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 11:43:37'] 20% of my portfolio is in APPL. Not selling. Difficult to find a safer stock. I will keep it until retirement in 22 years. Use new cash when available to buy CRM, that is my advice.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:32:59'] I wouldn't buy CRM at this level but I would note that...1 part of the reason why it was a while before it got into as strong of an uptrend it's been in was because it doesn't go anywhere when it's in the process of working on mergers and 2 it has a nice longer term cup pattern that it broke out of (yeah, I know, TA, blabla...).I'm kicking myself a little for not making my position a full one (it's a half one) but I think it's ran too hot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 00:59:36'] Don’t sell AAPL. I think they’re going to 200 in 22 (depends on chips shortage) new MacBooks are flying off the shelves AAPL is supply bound but the margin on their own devices is higher then Intel-based ones. And this is not priced in IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-31 12:02:32'] CRM is business to business software company and unless you have some quality industry information (I.e. from competitors, people who are using CRM software) that it will sell more (than analysts expects), there is no reason to buy it unless it’s PE and CAPE is attractive I.e 15. (That is not the case).

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 09:59:20'] Lots of people seem to be complaining on how stuff is overvalued and what not. It seems likely to be true but the indexes are still off their highs. Look at what happened to Tesla from 2020-2021 and how it destroyed shorts and was exuberantly priced, same thing can happen with Nvidia and it can stay higher for longer. Markets can stay irrational longer than individuals can stay solvent. If someone regularly DCA's from their paycheck they get to average in the lows and the highs and general 30+ year outlook is that USA should go up or we have bigger problems. And we are NOT Japan... Also there is a strong possibility that high beta growth stuff was expensive before but got overshot to the downside and is just finding a reasonable floor, we don't really know.

What this means now is that they can still make an announcement via 8K in this upcoming week (apparently they need to get 13 signatures physically signed), but they cannot start the actual buybacks until the earnings report is released end of April. There is a blackout period that starts April 1st. Some were hoping they would both announce the resolution and initiate buybacks before today, but it looks like that will have to wait. Patience will be key here.It looks like BTU had large buying right before close today, likely in anticipation of big moves coming up. Quarter end selling might have also impacted today's price action at least early on (BTU is not an ESG name funds want to have on their portfolio). There will be selling pressure from Elliott Management looking to exit their position, but shareholder returns will likely bring in plenty of new buyers, including BTU itself, to bring stock price up. I'm roughly equally bullish on AMR/BTU, with the risk of BTU not executing on the capital returns making up for AMR having less upside.

Because 3800 is the new bottom.  SPX will not only end green, it will never go red this year.

But, they're also still raking in cash while their shares have dropped 80% from recent highs. Their EPS is 3.61 while their share price is like $9.50. Their P/B ratio is like 0.27. ok so they don't have a bright future, who cares? they don't have to be around long to earn back my investment, at least if they paid a dividend, which they don't.

POST_TEXT: b'Im newish to investing and just turned 20 so dont have tons of experience, but I was looking at every recent earnings call for Apple and each time they beat, but the stock drops a few dollars everytime. Im just curious as to why?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 08:23:01'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 10:55:22'] earnings have been a complete crapshoot this quarter.  completely unpredictable.look at Alphabet yesterday.  -3% AH following the earnings release & conference call.  Today is +6% (I'm guessing the price target upgrades fueled the run).I have 50 shares in AAPL which I plan on holding thru earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 13:29:16'] I wouldn't expect much volatility from Apple unless they surprise us with a huge beat or terrible miss.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 08:23:32'] It’s very common in AAPL to drop after earnings. Usually because everything is already priced in and more is expected from a company of that caliber. That’s just what I personally think caused it to drop, but there could be several other factors too.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 09:06:57'] If price spikes up prior to earnings then it's likely to drop after unless they smash the absolute fuck out of estimates
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 09:57:28'] Honestly I have no idea, but given the fact it’s slowly climbed after each earnings I’m not worried
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 12:00:32'] Doesn’t matter if you’re long
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 09:04:23'] Numbers are pretty much known befor the earnings calls (people can do basic math). So people buy BEFORE quarterly numbers and the beats are priced in. Consequently you'll see a selloff right after to take short-term profits.You'll see such patterns also with other companies (e.g. used to be quite a predictable pattern for Tesla...though this time - not so much)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 08:41:43'] Because we now live in a world where a beat isn’t enough. Analysts expect guidance that also beats. They need beats that beat their beats. We are just about at a juncture where a 1% beat on estimates is considered bearish outlook. It’s like when I was in grade school. Analysts (parent’s) expectations were A’s across the board. I post my quarterly earnings (grades) and I’ve got the A, A-, A-, B+, A. But guess what? Even though I met analyst expectations, I still got downgraded to a Scold and had my Nintendo confiscated for the summer. A++ or go home.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 14:38:22'] $AALP only up. Just need a bit of patience
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 17:38:32'] Welcome to the markets :)Remember just because you interpret something as positive doesn't mean the market will. News doesn't move markets, people do. There were more people selling the news than buying it. Why? Could be a million reasons. It's better to wait until earnings are out to gauge the reaction, and then make your move.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-28 05:36:10'] Lot of newbs here — a tip: most companies’ share price rises in advance of earnings, and then drops after earnings. There are a variety of reasons but the two main reasons are: profit taking aka people selling shares (buy the hype, sell the news), and also because the market is typically pessimistic — if Apple has a stellar quarter, what’s to say they can repeat that success next earnings cycle? Retail sentiment rotates elsewhere as a result in the short term. All this being said, if you invest in. AAPL, just buy shares at a regular time interval and add 30 years. You won’t regret it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-08 07:00:58'] Usually there’s a run-up before the event and then depending on the product, it’ll go down or up. Sometimes it might do pretty much nothing as it’s priced intl;dr: Maybe up or down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 04:59:37'] BRK seems like a defensive investment,  when tech goes up, investors sell BRK and buy tech.When tech goes down they sell tech and seek shelter in BRK
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 05:17:00'] BRK is much more than it's AAPL holding. Apple is around 150b of BRK, which has a market cap of 779,28b.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 04:53:36'] “Exposure” is a pointless metric in investing. Hold good companies to maximize the reward. Hold diversified funds to minimize the risk. But they aren’t remotely the same. And “exposure” doesn’t do anything for you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-09 05:16:04'] VOO or QQQ are index ETFs with the goal of replicating an index they're tracking. Shares are created and redeemed as needed precisely to ensure the market price does not stray far away from the NAV.So it's a little different from buying shares of BRK for exposure to AAPL, as the two have no such mechanism to couple their prices.

Technical analysis suggests that this run up is starting to be, if not already, overbought. It may correct down, sideways, or continue bullish upward momentum. Nobody knows and if they say they do have them buy you a power ball ticket 😊The fed is starting that taper, talks of rate increases, etc. Personally I'm neutral to slightly bearish for the next 3 to 6 months as that's when the taper is thought to end. You can use options as well too:Sell an OTM covered call at a price you'd be happy to let your shares go. This is assuming you have 100+ shares and have options available on your broker.Hold, buy the dip. Time in the market usually beats timing the market. Either buy shares or sell an OTM/ATM cash secured put option when it drops. (again, assuming you want 100 shares and have the $$$ to buy).If you're not comfortable with options that's OK. I would suggest that you make sure you understand the risks and limitations of options.Obligatory: not financial advice.

They could afford it and if they were successful, the ad revenue would become a significant part of their business. The linked article shows ample evidence that Apple is moving towards launching a search engine offering. Has this been factored into Apple and Googles stock price?

If Apple was to introduce their own search engine, this practice would obviously cease.How do you come to that conclusion???It’s worth 10B dollars a year to google, does not necessarily mean its worth 10B dollars a year to Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 13:10:55'] No. Apple cannot compete wit google on a search engine. No company can. Maybe in a 100 years or if google goes bankrupt. The sheer amount of data google has collected throughout years of being the top search engine is too much for anyone to even come close.That is exactly why google is having another round of antitrust case. Most likely apple is the one that started it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 13:55:32'] Apple is capable of a lot but I don't think a search engine is one of those things. Google has 20 years of data that simply can't be replicated. At best, Apple cracks something in AI that allows them to skip decades of user input but the biggest news out of that most likely wouldn't be a search engine (woot Skynet!).My money is on services and health, especially if those can combine at a corporate level. Imagine in 10 years if Apple can get a true barebones Apple Watch that can be sterilized. Instead of a wrist tag for everyone who gets admitted into a hospital, they get a watch instead that monitors basic vitals and ties you to the hospitals network. Apple could make money on each unit sold and charge the hospital a subscription based service to manage them.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 16:50:17'] I have thought for a while now that it would be a good move for Apple to buy DuckDuckGo.It would be pocket change for Apple to buy them, they both share a focus on privacy, and it would save Apple from having to start from scratch.DuckDuckGo does not have much market share right now, but if Apple bought them, made them the new default search engine for Safari, gave them access to greater financial resources to further improve their quality, and used Apple's massive marketing power to market them as the search engine that respects your privacy (unlike Google); I could see them taking a good bit of market share away from Google.I can already imagine Apple doing some commercials similar to the "I'm a PC/I'm a Mac" commercials but instead with Google and DuckDuckGo with a focus on privacy. This would really hurt Google quite a bit if it happened.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 16:45:38'] If Apple really gets into the search + ads business they’ll really be killing their current privacy focused ecosystem. Or they’d need to invest a lot to educate people that all ad companies are not bad - example: DuckDuckGo

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-24 22:27:48'] Apple won’t monetize a search engine like google does because of their commitment to privacy. And that’s a major reason that if they create an engine it won’t be as profitable. It’s infinitely easier to get paid for another company to handle the search needs. Why would they make their own search engine? I just...I don’t see that happening.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-25 00:20:51'] This is a crazy possibility. Can you imagine in 50 years everyone using apple like today's Google . Apple has a unique grip on the masses and consumers. But Apple can never block Google if you think about it. They can make it harder for people to make a custom homepage. But not having Google seems like it could be a deal breaker for many apple users. But maybe apple loyalty causes a huge competition of Android vs apple
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-25 01:05:51'] No, it's not about Google stopping Apple from making a search engine. Think about how many people don't know how to or won't put in the effort to change their default search engine. You might think it's a small number, but it's actually quite a lot. With safari holding a significant portion of the market, the amount of ad revenue and data tracking can be huge simply by changing the default.This especially holds true for businesses. Many employees don't use Chrome as they don't want to sign in and have their employers know what they're browsing. So they end up using the stock browser, internet explorer or safari. If you can get the default search engine to Google instead, you now have knowledge of what the company employees are searching, hence what the company wants. That's a huge market for business right there.

They are a very quickly expanding USA battery manufacturer with a MC ($393) of less than cash on hand ($500m) and what I estimate will do $400m+ in revenue next this year (200-250m projected for 2022). Got a factory in Tennessee that is starting cell production this year to fulfill a $330m order for a 1.2GWh BESS order. Also will qualify for the IRA stipend of $45k/kWh since we do both cells (35k) + packs (10k). We expect over $1.5-2 Billion long term from the IRA just with the one USA factory. Oh and the DOE gave us a $200m grant to build a separator factory in partnership with G fucking M (General Motors). To help them fulfill their performance and safety goals, especially in their Ultium line of cells (think premium). We also are the sole cell supplier for Iveco’s new eDaily van… an electric version of Iveco’s normal (gas powered) eDaily… the most popular ($$$) commercial van in all of Europe. Anyways check back in with me in 2025 and 2030… things will be different

POST_TEXT: b'Everyone wishes they invested in AAPL or GOOGL (sorry if those are bad examples) at IPO, but it seems like the nature of an IPO has changed in my brief time watching the market, and I\'m wondering if anyone can either support or refute my theory. IPOs these days seem to be much bigger promoted events now, with higher prices for shares, meaning that "getting in early" is much less accessible than it once was.  Add in all the ways day trading has evolved over a generation, and it just seems like a different world.  The idea of "had I invested $10 in AAPL when I was young I would be a millionaire!" seems impossible now, but its very possible my lack of breadth on this topic is making me misunderstand the situation. \n\nApologies if this is the wrong sub, or if this question is just blatantly moronic. \n\nThanks.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 00:44:06'] I've been investing since the 1980's.  You're correct that IPO's have changed.  There's much more private equity around, which is why companies go private much later in their growth cycle than they did 30 years ago.  That means finding the $1 billion IPO that will grow to $10 billion is almost impossible.However, companies looking extremely overpriced early in their growth cycle has always been a feature.  All the megacap companies appeared overpriced by any standard valuation metrics early in their public life.So trying to forecast which companies will build the enduring sustainable advantage and take over an industry was just as hard then as now.For example, why did Google dominate search instead of Yahoo?How did Apple takeover smartphones instead of Nokia or BlackBerry?And Amazon?  Who would have predicted they'd take over online marketplace and cloud computing?There were lots of IPOs and startups in the 1980s and 1990s and most I remember that were hot for a while have either been acquired, failed, or gone nowhere.Identification of future megacap winners was just as hard then as now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 21:01:58'] I feel like most comments are missing the point.Venture capital has almost undoubtedly made it easier for companies to stay private longer so, when they do go public, they are much farther along in their growth. To name just a couple examples: Uber IPO'd at something like an $80B valuation. There's only so much higher a taxi company can go and, unsurprising, they're worth less today than at IPO. Same thing with Snowflake - they're a miniscule niche database vendor who IPO'd at 1/4 the price of industry juggernaut Oracle so likely the very best return you could hope for is 4x.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 21:34:29'] If you had invested in Apple when it was first trading in 1980, you might have sold that stock during the 90s when the company was really struggling. It's easy to look at Apple now and think it was an easy stock play, but Apple went through some really lean years and its survival wasn't guaranteed.On the other hand, those who believed in Apple in the 90s, invested in it despite its problems and held on as it skyrocketed, crushed it, IPO or not. Don't get fooled into thinking you need to be the first one in or you'll miss out, even if others are hyping that. You'll lose a lot of money that way (check out the charts for Rivian and Canoo).

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 20:42:54'] You could have slept on Microsoft for 10 years and then another 10 years and then another 10 years and still multiplied your money. We just havent had enough time to see things become hyper successful since like Facebook, which still IPOd only 10 years ago.If you had invested in Apple at IPO, youd have sold it when it was on the brink of bankruptcy. If you had invested in Apple when it was rolling out the first few generations of iPods, youd have done well. I know a story of a couple that sunk 10K into Apple after a tech show in that era and theyre millionaires today.These days, IPOs are mostly vehicles for exit strategies for CEOs and other early stage founders to get a return on their investment, not invite the broader market to share in their success.I do think weve been in a crummy economic cycle for a few years that doesnt have the spending or enthusiasm to really drive success of new hotshot companies. But that doesnt last forever. And it doesnt mean there arent great companies that arent still making money. But investments take time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 22:09:12'] The people who made out the most on apple were investing when people thought it was an irrelevant company on its way to bankruptcy. People who buy the right beaten down tech growth stocks now  (even more so 4 or 5 months back) could stand to win similarly. The problem is, Apple didn’t look like a good investment at the time, and there was no guarantee they would do well. Even people who invested in Apple when it was already a huge, 200 billion dollar company 10xedIt wasn’t about getting in early. If you got in early enough, in fact, you might have sold out in despair of Apple being a crap company. Not so different from getting in early to Snowflake, or DoorDash, etc. Now I’m not saying these companies are Apples. All I’m saying is, you don’t necessarily get rich from getting in early. You get rich from buying something that has value when no one sees the value in it, and by getting a bit lucky. Even stocks that tanked like C3 AI. If you bought it at 100 or above you were down 90%+ at one point.  If you bought it at 9 bucks when everyone had given up on it, you’re already sitting on a three bagger a few months later.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 22:45:14'] I'd say another factor is M&A. Multinational corporations now have access to enough information, analysis, and capital to identify a great company and either acquire before it becomes a competitor, or build out a better service/solution before the company gains enough market share to compete post-IPO.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 20:25:58'] No.Listen, you have to understand how bad most tech investments went in 1999-2000. The amount of money lost was astronomical. The few going well were outliers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 20:27:01'] Well, you might have had a similar viewpoint in 97-98-99. With the exception of the Covid flash  crash and subsequent subsidy-palooza, it's been a 12 or 13 year bull run since 2008. IPO's get pricey when money is easy. Money has been easy that entire time. It's only now starting to get back into normal historical range.Another problem is hindsight. Google looked pricey when it IPO'ed at $85/share. From 2004 that would have been something like a 50 bagger, or a 70 bagger if you managed to sell near it's 2021 peak. ***But in 2004 you were paying $85 for a company that earned 10 cents. Y***ou need some real understanding of the franchise to project a 21% CAGR for two decades and make those numbers look like a bargain.That wasn't clear to see in 2004, even though Google was the dominant search engine. Yahoo was the undisputed search king only a few years prior, so it wasn't hard to think maybe someone would displace Google in a few years down the road with an even better algorithm. We had recently witnessed Microsoft obliterate Netscape Navigator and Novell Netware. Cisco had just handed US Robotics and half a dozen other hardware manufacturers their hats.The days you are talking about with cheap Apple were days it was left for dead. Today there are no doubt a few of those left for dead companies that look like roadkill and will find a path back to success.Gamestop was labeled a zombie business prior to the console cycle, and they survived (so far). Before the squeeze they were just another disrupted retailer selling physical media in a digital world.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 00:17:05'] Sounds like survivorship bias to me. Realistically how many AAPL or GOOG can there be? AAPL, GOOG and the likes are the exception not the norm. 20 Years ago, there were the AAPL/GOOG equivalent in IBM/Dot Com stocks. The failures in IPOs are not publicised enough because no one wants to hear a story in failure, everyone loves to read about an underdog surpassing all expectations, so there’s very heavy survivorship bias in your judgment. Take a look at all the unicorns that have come and failed, how many “Next AMZN” have there been and how well have they fared since then.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 00:48:53'] I think a lot of people are missing on the fact that SPACs do exist.  SPACs funnily enough are an important avenue for some companies to raise funds and go public but with that being said, there's a tonne of shitcos to dig through when looking for the hidden gems.  There's also the fact that people harp up on about ETFs and index funds etc quite a lot so those who invest in riskier and smaller companies are often shunned or downvoted in subreddits like this.  What the others said about IPOs is true, it's mostly a money grab for companies further along development.  One of the companies I'm invested in did a seed, series A, series B and then SPAC round.  I guarantee you that if they did a Series C round, the company would probably go public after being worth 10-50x what they're worth when they SPACed.  If you want to see young companies using money from public investors to grow, look at SPACs but make sure you have a lot of time and conduct heaps of due diligence because for all the gems that are in that group, they're hidden beneath a mountain of shit companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 22:07:13'] It is not true those who put in $10 in Apple at early now has $1M valuation. I actually owned 100 shares of Apple stocks when they were shipping Apple 2 probably in 1981. Paid $27 and the sales were sluggish. After John Scully fired Steve Jobs  I sold it for $24 around in 1985 with a net loss of -$300.  Each trade had $250 commission. So -$800 loss not 1 million dollar valuation.When Google was working on another search engine, we already had Infoseek, Yahoo, Microsoft and several other established companies.  I felt Google the asking price was absurd. In fact, Infoseek is still the basis of search used by my employer even in 2010s.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 21:39:36'] I don't think it's necessarily harder to "invest early" as you say but I do think there are fewer unique companies arising and becoming publicly traded, that have stock worth buying. Because at this point in the corporate landscape so many needs and niches are already being filled by existing companies, so it's harder to find that diamond in the rough that has a new product/service/idea that makes you think "huh, I would definitely use that and they are on to something. I should invest in that".Not to say that new stuff isn't being created regularly, but rarely is it taken from inception to execution by an independent entity that then goes on to becomes publicly traded. More often stuff like that gets bought out by a larger player at some stage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 22:36:50'] A lot of recent 2020-2022 IPOs are down quite a lot below IPO price. They’re down 75% or even more. This is similar to IPOs in the late 90s being up 1,000% minutes after debut and then all tech collapsing 80% by 2000.So it seems to be the challenge is the same - can you really find the Google in the sea of Pets.coms and Geocities.coms and America Onlines.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 21:57:01'] If I recall correctly in order to go public **before** a company had to be "profitable" for 2 earning quarters with some other established data to be considered ready for ipo.  You and I know most the companies launched never made a penny start with Twitter.  I believe the best example is ipo etf  from Renaissance Capital which owns 84 different name new stocks unveilled in recent years. They are:*Airbnb*  *Snowflake*  *Royalty Pharma*  *BioNTech*  *Rivian Automotive*  *DoorDash*  *Palantir Technology*  *Li Auto*  *Roblox*  *Bill.com*  *Coupang*  *KE Holdings*  *Nu Holdings*  *ZoomInfo Technology*  *Unity Software*  *Coinbase Global*  *Bentley Systems*  *Xpeng*  *Full Truck Alli..*  *Robinhood* These are all highly pumped stocks that enabled the ipo etf peaked at $76 in Mar 2021 and not even 2 years it tanked to $28.69 today with a return of -62.25%. Can you spot any of them thinking some quarter and who knows when it will be profitable 2 consequately profitable?  These are from the easy money days.  Much of that money is incentives from the government to people got locked down to play Spacs and stocks. Today no one will invest in those check writing Spacs knowing many of these companies do not even have a good product in volume productions. Nikola is one.These are the bottom 14 of 84 of ipo etf portfolio sharing:*Doximity*  *Peloton Interac..*  *On Holding*  *Albertsons Comp..*  *Procore Technol..*  *Ryan Specialty ..*  *Inari Medical*  *Dun & Bradstree..*  *agilon health*  *Legend Biotech*  *Marqeta*  *SentinelOne*  *Shoals Technolgy*.I have no knowledge and will not want to throw money into almost all of them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 04:24:52'] Companies IPO when they are far larger now, especially in the US and to a similar albeit lesser extent in the UK. This is because VC funding is far more accessible. Here in the UK a regular private investor can invest small or large amounts into EIS, SEIS and VCT companies or funds, and not only be directly investing in early stage high growth companies, but also be given gigantic tax breaks for the privilege. (There are caps on this that mean it’s pretty much useless for institutions though).Because of this companies stay private a lot longer. Monzo was sat at $5B last year, and despite banks pushing them, haven’t announced an imminent IPO. Interactive Investors who were heavily funded by the MMC EIS, were at $1.5B also with no IPO plans. Scale this up to American proportions and you have tech companies and others worth $50B+ and quite happy to stay private. The UK receives more VC funding than Germany, France, Spain and Italy combined, for scale America received almost 8x this figure. The UK is one of only three $1T tech markets on earth, America has singular tech companies worth double that. I don’t think most American investors appreciate the sheer scale of the money sloshing around their market, ready to fund any half decent growth style company there is. If you look at the top ten VC firms for capital raised, deal flow, early stage and late stage, all of those lists are 9/10 American.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 11:21:16'] yes. IPOs have gotten harder bc everyone wanted to be early. But that was always dicey. Right now, “investing early” is probably looking for cyclical small cap opportunities that people have left for dead. esp companies that are on the cusp of going from losing money to making money, as that is often the start of a bull run when institutions will start to take positions. They are called cyclical bc they always come back. you can be earlier than the early guys there. offshore drillers was early two months ago and I think it is still early but some  have gone up 3x in the past month.Gold and silver may be “early” because they have been left for dead. Same with some copper miners, because copper has gone up but some small caps on the toronto or australian exchange have not gone up. same with uranium. there is a youtube channel called Crux Investor where guys from institutional backgrounds sit with companies of junior miner companies and really grill them. Some CEOs and companies seem to have “it”, where they hit their goals and they have assets that investors or other companies will want, and they have a clear plan to monetize them and unlock the value in the ground. no other sector will have their CEOs pay to sit down with an interviewer and get grilled like that in hopes that retail will listen. there is incredible alpha to be had there and some of those stocks have outperformed even in this environment where commodities stocks have suffered from recession fears and retail selling small caps (and it is really mostly retail participating in these small caps). You can be the smart money that buys from the dumb money here. I like Canadian nickel companies, African uranium miners, and any lithium or copper that has been dead money for the past few months and with the right management and assets.Some countries like Vietnam, Pakistan, South Africa, etc are going through huge issues and eventually, when things cannot get worse, will start to get better. I think it would be good to be invested in those countries at that point.lastly, and I am only in one bc I hate them, but SPACs with good structures that are in themes that will do insanely well in the next bull market have interesting warrants and decent deal structures. I’m not going to say anything beyond that bc I know lots of people got burned by Chamath and Ackman but warrants can be had at good prices and the market will turn around by 2027. buying premerger when retail has left SPACs for dead.Right now, I am going to start watching Norfolk and Southern, specifically NSC/SPX chart, because NSC seems to track the S&P pretty well, with little deviation. If it vastly underperforms like it did in the covid crash, you can basically the S&P with a higher dividend yield and at a discount. That would be a buy and hold forever scenario if investors dump on the aftermath of the spill.Roaring Kitty explained deep  value investing pretty well: If you don’t have one or two companies in your portfolio going bankrupt once in a while, you might not be taking on enough risk.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 12:56:41'] Yes!! Absolutely. IMO. Others may disagree.  IPOs as of late have been non profitable companies trying to raise cash by selling shares at high overvalued prices. Coinbase was an exception and was profitable but was still over valued. Rivian would be best example. I’m not sure when we will see the next Walmart, Amazon or Apple happen but my guess is it will be AI and possibly meta. They hopefully ditch the meta verse and stick to AI.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 13:32:50'] When a new generation has been excluded (late to the party) from the hyper growth names like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, etc - they are forced to manufacture volatility, which leads to the wild price action we have seen in recent years. Mainly, in my opinion though, the ability to raise capital & remain private longer than was thought possible just 15 years ago is the single biggest reason. In many cases, IPOs have become last resort for a strong company, and just a way to game the system and create individual wealth for weaker ones. A company like AAPL or AMZN IPO’d and immediately put the money to good work. They were ready to blast off, and the cash infusion made it possible. Feel like we don’t see that situation anymore
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 15:26:07'] the cost of going public, and of being public, has gone up dramatically in the last 20 years.  A huge driver of this is Gramm-Rudman, which was passed in response to Enron.  My current employer estimates that the legislation costs it somewhere between $1m-$10m/year in compliance (the cost of being publicly traded).   That cost gets passed on to our customers, and it also means there are a lot fewer IPOs, and the IPOs are much, much bigger companies.  Small companies are pushed out; medium sized companies wait.Plus we're in a bad investing environment right now.  All IPOs are basically on hold until we get better economic conditions.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 15:34:34'] Or you get the VC’s privately investing, who then wait for the IPO for public to invest and when price target is met the VC’s will cash out, effectively dropping value.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:38:56'] The nature of tech start-ups and the way of doing business in general has changed a lot in recent times, thanks to low interest rates. The low interest rates have caused a boom in private investments. &#x200B;20 years back, if you were a startup, you had to worry about profitability from day zero. There wasn't so much venture capital to go around. These days, companies like Uber (which had been called a startup for almost a decade) run on VC money, incurring losses year after year all in hopes that in future, they shall be able to monetize their big customer-base. They cannot IPO because then they will have to worry about things such as Quarterly reports and free cash flows. An early stage startup is better positioned to have investors who believe in their vision long term to be able to sacrifice a lot short term gains for creating long-term value. In the past, there was only so much VC money and you eventually had to figure out a path to profitability and give the VCs their exit and turn to the markets for raising more money.&#x200B;It's good in a way. With the low interest rates, there have been a lot of tech startups burning through cash in the name of growth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:25:11'] It's always been hard, I don't care what the asset is. Look at some of the big runners. With every one of them it was really easy to sell after a bit of a run-up even though they kept multiplying. Apple traded at a lower multiple for decades. To put that in perspective we now have Intel at 25. Let's say they do something right and the stock gets up to 50 or 55 or 60 now we're getting back to where it's recent highs were. If you owned it at 25 what are you going to do? See that's the problem and that's what everyone did with apple and Amazon and Nvidia, bitcoin, tesla. The list continues but these assets ran. It's just hard to hold on to because for every example like this that keeps going countless examples trade range bound having an investor buy the object around 25 ride it up to 50 or 60 and then a few years later find themselves at 30

POST_TEXT: b'Investment bank UBS has upgraded AAPL to a "Buy" and raised its price target to $142, based on a stable iPhone backdrop and the possibility of Apple entering the car market. \n\nIn a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, lead analyst David Vogt says that a "more stable long-term iPhone demand backdrop with better [average selling prices]" and Apple\'s "likely entry into the auto market" are driving the UBS revision on AAPL shares. \n\nThe analyst says that, based on analysis, aggregate iPhone demand in 2021 and 2022 should be relatively stable. He doesn\'t believe there\'s a "supercycle" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million. Looking ahead to 2022, Vogt also raised his 2022 iPhone shipment estimate to 215 million, up 10 million. He attributes the bump to the "stickiness of the iPhone ecosystem."\n\nhttps://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/31/ubs-upgrades-aapl-to-buy-raises-price-target-on-iphone-stability-auto-opportunity'

Now, it's effectively written in stone that it won't happen.On the other hand, given this crazy injection, another single 25bps may not be enough in the long run. The Fed really shot itself in the mouth with this rescue mission. People are on edge. We were going in the right direction, but now I'm not sure I can see beyond the smoke and mirrors. If anything, I no longer feel confident I understand the fundamentals enough to project what the most likely outcome is. In other words, I think the Fed just introduced a shit ton of volatility in a climate that really needs firm footing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 08:01:40'] Solid Economist article talking about the risks that these bank troubles are bringing to light and potential exposure, looking at the underlying issues rather than the troubled banks and their individual assets.[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deep-rot-america-banking-industry-104028781.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deep-rot-america-banking-industry-104028781.html)Below is an excerpt explaining the near term issue for some banks and the longer issue for any that take advantage of the asset swaps:"Insured deposits are the stickiest because they are protected if things go wrong. So Ms Jiang and co-authors looked at uninsured cash. They found that if half of such deposits were to be withdrawn, the remaining assets and equity of 190 American banks would not be enough to cover the rest of their deposits. These banks currently hold $300bn in insured deposits.The newfound ability to swap assets at face value, under the Bank Term Funding Programme, at least makes it easier for banks to pay out depositors. But even this is only a temporary solution. For the Fed’s new facility is something of a confidence trick itself. The programme will prop up struggling banks only so long as depositors think it will. Borrowing through the facility is done at market rates of around 4.5%. This means that if the interest income a bank earns on its assets is below that—and its low-cost deposits leave—the institution will simply die a slow death from quarterly net-interest income losses, rather than a quick one brought about by a bank run."

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 03:27:35'] It’s interesting how the Fed’s $300b bailout of the banks and the Swiss Fed’s $50b bailout of Credit Suisse have had such different effects on the market. Proportionately, $50b is a *much* larger amount for European markets than $300b is for US markets, looking at GDP, total market cap etc. Yet despite this proportionately larger bailout, European markets are at -3.5 to -4% for the week while SPY is at +1.5%.Why are European markets trailing US by 5-6% this week when proportionately, the $300b injected here should have less of a stimulating effect than the $50b there? Shouldn’t the proportionately larger sum injected in Europe cause European markets to surge faster than SPY? Europe hasn’t even had an *actual* bank failure, while we’ve had three banks fail this week alone.

This level of volatility in the fixed market is the equivalent of a VIX at 75 in the equities market.If you take a look around there are legitimate signs of a significant deterioration of financial conditions over the near term.I would suggest now would be a good time to take a second, or third, look at your risk profile and be prepared for what’s to come.I’m mostly long equities.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 15:18:11'] Reposting this since I didn't get any answers last thread:Could someone please explain the second paragraph about delta hedging in simple terms:> Some might wonder why a banking crisis is hitting oil so hard, as it is unlikely to impact crude demand and production. But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.So financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.The firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works? (What would be the price of the sale? Would it be higher or lower than the current market price? Who gets the right to buy/sell?)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 12:23:45'] I think hedge funds will squeeze regional banks until the Fed has to full on drop rates.  Not stop hikes, drop.The only investment that will exceed inflation will be tech.  Tech will hit obscene levels then we will have a massive deflationary bust afterward because inflation will rise obscenely.This does not bode well at all for anybody.  If I am wrong then this will just crab but digital assets lead QQQ and that's already shaking out.  Fed credibility is donezo.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought Ill try to do that and post it here. Thats my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, Ill try to answer everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Apples business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apples stock using discounted free cashflow. \n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.\n\nFirst lets review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. \n\nFor the valuation: \n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 13:14:16'] You should look into Buffett's financial statement analysis of businesses. You don't have to follow the guidelines exactly but it gives you hints to what great companies have in common in terms of financials. Look deeper into their 10Ks and see if the company aligns with your goals. There is a great 3h audiobook on that on Youtube called how to analyse financial statements by Warren Buffett and his student David Clark.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 12:48:51'] I like Apple very much. They have created such a strong moat with their brand which is really important. With the new M1 chip, the Macs and iPads have gotten a new life. The services segment has so much in store and it will improve Apple’s margins that are already solid. Financials are brilliant and they are really good at exceeding expectations from Wall Street. They have a huge warchest of money that they can use to improve the business. This huge pile of money makes their balance sheet healthy. Even dividends are growing if you’re into that.I have to mention Tim Cook. He’s such a good CEO. He’s worked a long time at Apple and knows the company very well. If the rumours of the EV and VR are true, it makes Apple an even tastier (no pun intended). I’m just gonna buy and hold. Simple as that. I’ll get rewarded for that sometime in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 14:18:45'] From our research, AAPL has accelerating EPS estimates over the past 12 months; its current price level and upward movement is supported by the estimates. Our metric isn’t a predictive indicator if this will continue, only that the current price and trend is supported. If estimates continue to accelerate, the price should follow.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 02:00:38'] is AAPL a gud buy?Yes it is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 19:18:02'] as a consumer, I have never regretted buying their products.  I’ve seen them deal with issues by replacing an older computer with a brand new model (5-7 years more current).as an investor, i made plenty of money trading them but then lost as much expecting them to keep growing at the same rate as the first 6-8 months when instead they dipped and i had way more shares.ultimately I know I want to be long their stock when i can buy more and hopefully one of my options will work out to get it at a good price point.I just got word they will be releasing an m1x equipped macbook with 10 cores and plenty of ram storage and video options so i’m looking forward to that as well
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 00:47:25'] I’ve been holding AAPL since 2008 and In fact, I started with this as a stock and I can only tell you that best way to go is long term And DCA. Another 5-8years, I am good for retirement.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-27 10:29:44'] AAPL is the best buy amongst mega cap techs. It is now selling at a 15% discount from its recent high and since then has been building a base around this 125-127 level.  The next big move should be up-up-up and all Apple has to do is just keep executing as it is doing.  The Epis lawsuit has been a drag recently, but realistically it is probably nothing more than a temporary PR cloud, the changes of a judge determining what Apple can charge on its platform is nill. The judge in this case has been pressuring Apple to compromise, but to allow unsecure aps to be sold on IOS without going through Apple's strict guidelines would defeat the whole purpose of IOS, that is a much safer place to be that Android or Windows. IOS has only about 1.2% of the malware, Android is around 25% and Windows is up around 35%. So bottomline is Apple is going to stand firm and likely defeat Epic. If they do compromise it will be a slight reduction, no lower than 25% and that won't hurt them much.  At 125 I consider APPL around 50% undervalued with very little downside risk especially since they have 100 billlion allocated for buybacks and love to buy their own stock whenever it does down.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 12:40:07'] I liked your analysis to be honest so good job. It’s a tough one because Apple seems quite pricey at the moment but it’s a market leader with a strong moat and has a lot of potential for innovation. Makes the stock attractive even at a premium.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 04:45:53'] People don't seem to have cottoned onto this yet but AAPL is making a very slow transition into services.Every quarter, that number is slowly trickling up, as they move money into it. This is exactly what they did when they slowly moved money from the iPod to the iPhone.Buy and hold, AAPL will run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 07:09:50'] Lol at people saying they are waiting for the next dip. Just buy the stock. When you buy a stock you are investing in a BUSINESS first, and making returns is a result if/when you sell. You are worried about saving like $10 a share to make $100 a share in the future if not more if you just hold it. LONG!
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 12:40:54'] When I play around with a few variables in my DCF valuation, I end up getting around $90-100.00 fair value of equity. I’m a bit more optimistic, but it’s good to see someone else in the ballpark of my guesstimations.I think the main difference is I see a bit more growth expected in the near term and a bit more profitability assuming their services business keeps expanding.Regardless, it’s Apple. I think DCA is a perfectly fine option.Edit: damn drag-texting

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 15:32:32'] This place is not a good one for getting a level headed unbiased opinion on AAPL. Too many people preach blindly buying apple and that it's a "savings account." There's a lot of forward looking innovation and success already baked into the price, and I never see anyone mention any threats to this company, just MOAT. Having said that, I'm not bearish on the company, but there are dips to capitalize on. You just missed the dip.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 09:52:42'] Here's the thing about Apple. There's a lot of questions about growth and innovation especially since Cook is the operational CEO not the visionary CEO.But it's definitely *not* a bad buy. Apple is never a bad buy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 10:19:29'] Curious about the Apple push recently with Cathy’s Ark and Bill gates foundation selling their stakes recently wouldn’t that be more of a sign that they don’t expect much growth in this stock anytime soon ?
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 14:18:18'] You don’t take an analyst estimate and then discount it. The estimate is already built from a discounted cash flow model. What estimated growth rate and P/E ratio did you use for your future estimated price? You think the largest company in the world is going to double again (from current prices, not your estimate) in 5 years to become a $4 trillion company? From your estimate fair value you think it would triple in 5 years?
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 14:27:08'] Apple is always a good buy
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 16:48:27'] very good job. Straight to point, no bullshitting.I'd like to add that apple has a strong brand, very smart engineers, and their ecosystem is very hard for consumers to "quit". (these are good moats). I'm not sure how to valuate these intangible assets, but it reduces my sense of risk, so I'd be willing to pay a premium above my intrinsic value calculation. I'm just not sure how much extra I'd pay; haven't thought about it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 16:56:50'] I think you've just done a DCF for 10 years into the future and got a share price of 90, but then you've said that you think the share price will be 240 in 5 years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 14:57:16'] Nica analysis. People have a positive vibe around AAPL and always in the bull camp. But, as investors, we need to stay considering the risk. The problem with Apple is the iPhone unit sold is declining - the growth of both revenue and earnings is due to increase in price rather than volume. Still, I will keep AAPL. Another thing regarding M1 and M2 (M series) processor, it is really interesting to see how this tech could boost Apple revenue other than iPhone.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 12:54:07'] Never heard of it
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 19:55:33'] I dont think the world is ready for a 4-5 trillion company.  Apple is coming off a supercycle.  Hardware still makes up the majority of its revenue.  Apple is up from 80 last year. I dont think apple can continue taking 30% cut on app revenue.  I think apple will be flat for this year until we get a better idea of its prospects.  Just my amateur opinion.  I do own apple long term tho.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 17:25:25'] Not a good time to buy, big portion  of 40% of their service revenue is at risk. Most likely scenario is they lose some where around half of it. Their earnings will be affected until expectations adjust. E.g., see https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21369460/apple-fortnite-app-store-services-business-model-epic-games

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 00:22:00'] Realistically stock picking, especially a mid-somewhat large cap isn’t easy, heck even for large/mega caps. Just quickly looking at this stock though there’s a couple things I **personally** don’t like… it lacks volume, average volume seems to be about 300k, it’s a South Korean company, long term chart looks ehh. The P/E can be “great”, earnings, financial statements, PRs, etc and the stock might not move how you would expect it, I do believe being a *by the book* trader/investor is great, but it has been a bit out of touch these last several years. Social media and social perception is a huge thing these days. I do think fundamentals will come back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:20:48'] How much do you have invested? Under $1m? Yes do the concentrated portfolio with 4-6 stocks. Companies you can stay on top of. A more diversified portfolio or etf portfolio you sacrifice substantial gains. Of course exposure to risk is much greater but this is how big money is made.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 13:04:55'] If you’re interested in learning about investing, I would say start by listening to as many diverse approaches as you can, and see what makes sense, what ideas seem to repeat across different approaches, what types of assets people use, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 22:06:27'] This guy is a billionaire. When you have billions of dollars you can afford to "just keep buying stocks you like when they're down" indefinitely.It seems like a terrible example to be basing any conclusions about anything on.There is absolutely nothing conservative about his situation. I'm no stock wizard but conservative is usually investing in stuff like ETFs where someone more experienced sells bundles of stuff packaged together. Picking individual stocks with no real experience it's just another form of gambling. Even the most conservative form of picking solo stocks from gut intuition is still very volatile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 01:42:18'] Conservative? Then I *think* the most important variable is moat. Which is hard to put a number to. But you can kinda tell who's got it, who don't, and who *really* got it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 12:15:40'] Apple didn't end their partnership with Intel. Tim Cook literately announced that they still have some very exciting products with Intel down the pipeline at the end of the keynote today.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 12:32:51'] The market is so forward looking that it not only anticipates the dip, it buys before it happens to get ahead of it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 12:30:50'] one of the biggest? they didnt use Intel in their phones or tablets, only their desktops and laptops.Dell, HP, Lenovo, all use more intel chips than Apple
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:19:29'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 12:29:46'] Apple makes up something like 3% of their revenue. they're also a very difficult customer to work with as they make a lot of demands. Over time this may actually be a good thing for Intel.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:18:47'] * They didn't end the partnership. There are still macs with intel cpus in development* Apple working on arm-macs has been predicted since months and was more or less known . Good investors would have this rumor already priced in * macs are just a part of the overall sales. Other companies will still need to buy intel processors* AMD is ahead right now but investors hope that intel will drop better cpus in the future* marketshare right now and prediction of marketshare in a few years* cpus won't go away. huge need for laptops, modems, iot, server etc. There is a tough competition but intel is in a good position overall
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 15:11:12'] this was already HEAVILY rumoured a month ago. so probably priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 20:45:29'] Can we please not call a 1% change a jump?
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:18:06'] I don’t even keep up with the news that much and I heard of Apple creating their own chips a long time ago so perhaps this has already been accounted for.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 15:39:27'] Not entirely sure, but couldn't it have something to do with the transition away from Intel taking "at least" two years? Whereas some analysts expected a shorter time frame?
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 13:49:32'] This move was announced months ago.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:38:03'] Aapl may have underestimated how many people buy Macs because they can bootcamp/parallels Windows and run dual OS on 1 machine.  Literally 50% of the people in my last company had MacBooks but ran Windows on it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 14:47:19'] I think it's been said, but he mentioned they will continue to develop INTEL based macs for the next couple years or cycles. That is why it jumped.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 19:39:23'] Apple is a teeny tiny percent of Intel's profits.  And apple is only (eventually) getting off Intel CPUs, but Intel makes more than just CPUs.  They make other hardware, software and services that Apple will probably still buy. The 1% "jump", if you can even call it that, is probably  the market reacting to the news that Apple wasn't going with Intel's  rival AMD.  If Tim Apple had announced that they were switching to some kind of Ryzen chip, *then* Intel would have been down.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:27:17'] Buy the rumour, sell the news.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 18:48:13'] It was common knowledge they were switching to ARM, that was already priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 19:53:09'] It's because the street has known this for a long ass time. It bought Intel's mobile baseband business last year because Apple has a history of insourcing components or acquiring smaller companies which make one of their parts. People have been thinking Apple will insource its Mac basebands for years. Intel's PC products have always been lower margin than its Data Center Group so when it says "we're shifting away from basebands into other higher margin products" investors like that, because Intel is at the point where it can't grow revenue much further since its fkn enormous. So sacrificing a little bit of revenue for higher margins is often seen as a plus for mega-cap companies since higher margins = higher cash flow = higher dividend/buybacks, which the majority of mega caps are aiming for.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 15:56:46'] That news was already priced in lol. Stonks only go up
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:29:41'] Intel never figured out mobile, now they are paying the ultimate price of growing complacent. Growth today is a bull trap. I liquidated 10 years of positions. This is Boeing bad.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:15:15'] I moved to AMD for my newest PC and pretty happy so far.. sorry intel!
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 14:29:51'] This surprised me too. How could they not take a dive from it? Even 3% is a sizable amount.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:20:29'] Because these news are old and it's priced in
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:25:20'] It was already known that they would be replacing the chips. It was already priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:46:59'] Yes, I think that‘s not that bad for Intel. Intel last year revenue was 80bn $. Apple‘s share in ut was 2% to 4%. i.e. 1.5 bn to 3bn $. That‘s not much difference. Apple puts lot of pressure on its vendors. I think intel now can take steps that genuinely helps intel in long run. Intel‘s main focus is on IoT, Autonomous cars, Cloud conputing etc.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:52:09'] Losing....Losing.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:58:56'] they will go back to intel, people will want it.  ARM is ok but not if your doing high end computing.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-23 04:47:23'] Apple is a big customer for intel, but maybe not not the most important. - those titles go to Dell, HP, Lenovo and other primarily Windows manufacturers before Apple. Intel gets a gross [$3.4bn](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/technology/apple-macs-intel-chips.html#:~:text=Intel%20sells%20to%20Apple%20about,C.J.%20Muse%2C%20an%20Evercore%20analyst.) (Paywall) for its chips, out of a total gross of $71bn. That's around 4%.There's [opinion pieces](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-this-case-losing-apple-as-a-customer-would-be-good-news-2020-06-15) out there that surmize that Apple really isn't the best company as a customer, being extremely demanding and needy, and so with them being a relatively minor force in Intel's income, eliminating the partnership would allow Intel to free up resources to do other things. It seems those buying the stock might be in mixed agreement here.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:19:33'] Intel received some bad news today. This means that in the future, Intel is more likely to receive good news. This is very bullish.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:26:45'] Apple is the smallest and probably most annoying customer Intel has. The 3% revenue cut is nothing against the 10% more workforce that Intel now has available since they don't have to deal with specifics to make things allegedly "perfect" anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:08:10'] Because they don't make money off apple. It was already known yet not official. No reason for the stock to move at all to old news.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 15:49:20'] The reason shown in my brokerage account was that “Apple is only expected to drop Intel chips 2 years from now.” What an optimistic market 😄
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 15:54:38'] I read it will take like 2 months to transition into using the new chips.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 13:01:10'] In short time, this is good news for both $MSFT and $INTC since more people will opt for Wintel machines, not wanting to go through pain of transition. Who would buy new Macs when it will be obsolete in 2 years.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 17:52:12'] Obviously Apple was holding them back.  Intel makes good chips and dominates AMD and now that they dont have make sure their stuff is playing nice with Apple tech, they can redistribute their workforce to other areas of development.If the world had to pick intel or apple to keep around id like to think intel takes the cake. Apple is a brand, without the best of the best in their stable they ain't shit.  Having GE, Samsung, Intel as your components makes you technically superior.. Without hardware superiority they're literally just overpriced shit. Look it as the value that Apple owned has returned to Intel.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-22 16:39:00'] Intel is screwed, a semi company run by an accountant. Lisa su is getting ready to absolutely trash them. Jim Keller, a legend, walked out on the train wreck.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 13:51:29'] Honestly, there's a very good chance that such a portfolio would outperform the broader market in the next 5-10 years. These are well-run companies with diversified revenue streams. Obviously only buying a few companies is risky, compared to an broad ETF--but these are some of the best companies in any index. Let's be real--these companies could go the way of IBM or Blockbuster, but not overnight. You'll have time to modify your portfolio if the need arises.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 10:36:05'] Apple stock is at the same price it was last August…it’s moved sideways with Amazon for the last 6 months.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-30 05:39:18'] I'm reading a lot of negative comments on this thread about this strategy. Does everyone realize that you can walk into every office in the world and every employee will have GOOG or AAPL phones and log in to their MSFT workstation? It's not a coincidence that the dominant operating systems and cloud service providers are in this position. The whole world depends on these companies. Every successful business and every failed business will dish out money to these companies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 11:07:28'] Have you considered that this might be too volatile for you? Having a tech-only portfolio means that when money is moving out of the tech sector, and this could last months, which means you could be seeing a lot of red. Most redditors and their tech stocks got burnt badly in Feb/Mar for this reason and have not recovered.While index funds have not performed as well, them being diversified across multiple sectors gives your portfolio more stability. There is also no guarantee that tech will continue to be the most dominant sector on the off chance that inflation and interest rates go out of control.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 14:48:43'] Though these arent bad picks, I personally dont recommend it. Im a tech guy too but I play it much more defensively at a time when valuations are high. Remember its not just comparing valuation, there is also macro conditions to consider.For example, right now, the entire market PE is in bubble territory with the S&P500 PE hovering around 45. Even though we can explain this rationally with covid earnings, low interest, bonds being dead money, inflation, and other things, markets are not rational.So for me personally, I play defensive when the macro indicators are bad. Thats not to say I dont like AMZN, GOOG, APPL or MSFT, but that I dont trust valuations.Right now I am basically running 25% cash, and I would say 50% of my actual portfolio (not including the cash) is defensive. Consumer cyclicals, consumer non-cyclicals, blue chip with low PE+Div growth, real estate and I even have some fixed income (preferred stock for REITs I consider reliable long term).I would suggest you take the macro indicators into account. I also highly recommend a div paying strategy and letting the pot of cash build itself for dips and crashes.Now if markets PE starts to look good again (sub 30), then I would probably switch the strategy to what you are doing and just buy high growth cash cows. Which is what I basically did last year in the crash and in the financial crash though I didnt buy tech specifically this time around.As a final disclosure, my 15 year performance is absurd using the flexible strategy above. Most dont believe it but its basically about 30% yoy growth... Not saying everyone can replicate this but as it turns out, like great chefs, great investors can come from anywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 13:06:17'] Yes, I think having only 4 stocks in mostly one sector is a terrible idea.

These companies have tons and tons and tons of runway.What people do not get is they really have barely even got started.  Take Google.  They have so much room to further monetize the assets they have collected.The big four are more and more going to do their own stuff instead of using others.  Take chips.  Google has already been doing their own network processors and AI silicon and that will continue to spread.   Same with Amazon that is already started to do their own processors for their cloud.   But it will be one thing after another.    These companies just have resources unlike pretty much anything before.   Plus they are not shy about owning the entire stack.   https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/09/google_processor/

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 16:18:38'] I mean, if you have 80% in VGT, that means that you already have 16% of your portfolio in AAPL and \~13% in MSFT although there's none in AMZN and GOOG. 4 of the 5 biggest holdings in VTI are the companies that you've mentioned as well. Can you not just reduce VGT to 60-70% and split the money between GOOG and AMZN? Also, spread those investments out over a couple of months or even half a year. AMZN is quite pricey right now although they obviously have a good thing going.But yeah, I also work in Tech and I get what you're saying. Those 4 companies are so dominant that it's hard to see any challenges for them in the foreseeable future unless they f\*\*k up big time!It's interesting to see what will happen with AMZN now that Bezos has stepped back.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-28 22:29:56'] I love each of those stocks toy mentioned and I'm significantly paring down my portfolio and keeping all of those.That being said, I would say play a happy medium and keep 50% of your portfolio in the vanguard ETFs and 50% in the stocks you mentioned. Still get some diversification but still significant exposure to the tech behemoths.Just be aware that at some point you'll need to rotate out of one or more of those stocks if signs of long term weakness / slowdown pop up
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-30 23:04:00'] The main problem I see: where’s FB? 🙂Honestly, it’s not my strategy, but if you don’t have any other ideas for picks and just want to expose your money to the market, it’s probably a fine idea. I’d recommend ETFs with large holdings of these securities over holding just these individually, though.Either way, I personally would say don’t sell your ETFs, just add on the individual stocks over time to get heavier weightings in them. That’s just me, though.

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-28 05:18:37'] There's a few ways of interpreting this:1. The tech bubble has gone too far, and we're all doomed this year (not like all those previous calls of doom every year for the past ten years).2. It's testimony to Germany's lack-of-modernisation. It's perfectly reasonable that a collection of world-leading tech companies with global reach will beat a collection of high-to-mid car companies with significant (and growing) competition.The question is: which is it?

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-28 08:21:01'] Not sure how relevant this statement is.  The largest publicly traded German companies are traded on US exchanges. You should really compare the largest publicly traded US companies (MSFT and AAPL) vs the largest German companies (VWAGY and DMLRY). They both have market caps around the $57B and $59B range or about $120B collectively.  This is about 1/20th of what MSFT and AAPL have. This is still irrelevant as these companies are in completely different industries but in their industries they are both at the top.  It really just shows which industries are more valued/desired/used or whatever you want to call it.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-29 11:09:08'] You're comparing apples (pun intended) with oranges.  Germany practices a kind of Capitalism called "Renish Capitalism."  This naturally impacts share prices.    We can debate later about whether the average German is happier than or lives better than the average American.  For now, here are some of the differences."In recent debates about the nature and future of capitalism, the United States and Germany are typically understood to represent opposing models  with  deep  historical  roots. In  the  realm  of  business  culture (Unter-nehmenskultur) and industrial relations, American business epitomizes a market-based, “hire-and-fire” model of capitalism in which labor unions were never very powerful and have become virtually insignificant. German enterprises ... are still marked  by  a  socially  based,  corporatist  culture  (“Rhenish  capitalism”) founded  on  strong  unions  and  labor  participation  in  management  (co-determination,  or Mitbestimmung).  Methods  of  finance  and  control  provide  a  second  point  of  contrast.  Shareholdings  in  most  large  American corporations are publicly traded and widely dispersed, salaried managers seem all-powerful, and US companies resemble commodities, easily bought  and  sold.  In  Germany,  a  “relationship-based”  system  predominates, in which large shareholders are more common and more powerful, while companies enjoy close relationships with banks, creating significant barriers to takeovers by holding large stakes in each other. A third element  concerns  their  respective  strengths  in  manufacturing.  American manufacturers still generally adhere to the style of mass production taken to its limits by Henry Ford, using specialized machines, narrowly defined skills, and closely supervised work processes. Their German counterparts excel,  as  they  have  historically,  at  more  flexible  forms  of  batch  or  customized  production,  relying  on  general-purpose  machines  and  skilled workers from  COMPARING U.S. AND GERMAN CAPITALISM  by Dunlavy and Welskopp

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-28 23:02:42'] The one thing I always keep in mind is that a stock’s value is only worth what the next person is willing to pay for it. If two companies are larger than the entire German Stock Market, the question becomes, do you have more FAITH in Microsoft and Apple growth, or the growth of the German economy?
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-28 07:51:39'] Europe may have us beat when it comes to quality of life and social safety net, but their economic growth and innovation is soooooo wack. Investors there are way too conservative and don’t have much of a risk appetite, so tech startups have a hard time raising the money needed to grow. On top of that, over-regulation when it comes to starting a company slows everything down. Between that and their less intense entrepreneurial culture in general, that region has become the economic equivalent of the complacent union employee who’s just collecting paychecks.

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-28 06:58:11'] Just to add some points. Many German companies are never going public and are quite small compared to US juggernauts. The intention behind this decision is simply to avoid problems with shareholders and publishing results. Companies like Trinamic or Beckhoff are only known to a few but they are quite influential by either developing new business models or new technology. It was the foundation of Germany's development after WW2. The reason for the low importance of shares was the absence of large pension funds, which are pumping money into the system, because Germany's pension system was organized collaborative, hence the current generation is paying for the pensions. The notion of badly educated simpletons, the sum of prices of  shares is mirroring the success of an economy  is not just exaggerated and a mono causal explanation, it's stupid. The market for shares  can be a symptom for success and too much money at the same time. When investors and pension funds have a problem to find investment objects and the money is pushed into the stock market it becomes usually a problem for everyone, when the market makes a correction again. But worse is the characterization of  European countries as "socialist", which is marking a typical US stupidity, by expanding the definition of a term until everything is fitting under the umbrella of this propaganda shit. I have no understanding for such idiots whether it is coming from Sanders or the GOP side. When shares of US companies are getting higher prices the reason might be the stream of money from Asia, because some investors might fear instability. It's the reason US bonds have a relative low yield. Only German bonds have or had  a lower yield.

These three stocks performed well over the past 5 years, but you are throwing diversification out the window if you are investing your whole portfolio in 3 large cap growth tech stocks. Yes, the returns of the three stock portfolio look fantastic but i wouldn't invest solely in individual stocks (especially only 3) with anything but speculative free cash especially those as correlated as these three.You mention chasing returns with small cap stocks, but that is all you are doing investing in 3 stocks based on their previous 5 yr performance.You never know what the next black swan event will be, and that's why diversification is the way to go.

If we could all do that we’d all be billionaires by the end of the year.You’ve essentially picked out the major stocks that performed the best over the past five years, compared them to the market as a whole, and concluded that the best performers performed the best. This line of reasoning suffers from survivorship bias.Had you chosen to compare the market as a whole to for example the 10 biggest companies, and not drawn the line at the biggest companies that also performed the best, your result would have been quite different. It would’ve included Exxon Mobil and Wells Fargo, both of which has lost about 50% of their respective value in the period. You would’ve had Berkshire Hathaway, which is basically flat for the period (+31%). Johnson & Johnson sports a meager +50% increase for the period. General Electric has lost more than three quarters of its market value since 2015. JP Morgan is up about 50% and Novartis is down around 15%.The total return for the period, assuming no rebalancing, amounts to about 44%.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-24 23:19:04'] Cool retrospective, doesn’t offer a plan forward. Maybe the idea is you identify a few excellent blue chips but it seems all you’re doing is reducing diversification and raising return. On a risk-adjusted basis this isn’t doing anything, in fact, this is far worse than the market.

POST_TEXT: b" \n\n# 'Fortnite' maker Epic Games sues Apple over App Store policies\n\nThe lawsuit comes after Apple removed 'Fortnite' from its App Store. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n *Fortnite* developer Epic Games is suing Apple after the company [removed the game](https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html) from its App Store. In [a lawsuit](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf), Epic accuses the iPhone maker of anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior. Epic brings this suit to end Apples unfair and anti-competitive actions that Apple undertakes to unlawfully maintain its monopoly in two distinct, multibillion dollar markets, the company writes in a court filing, pointing to Apples control over the App Store and payments processing for in-app purchases."

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 15:48:00'] Apples position of preventing gaming platforms that it feels 'hurts' their gaming position is one of the dumbest moves Apple has ever made.  I'm a sub at r/apple and 99/100 they get behind any move Apple makes... not in this case, the overwhelming sentiment that moves to block Microsoft xCloud on their platform is asinine.  I wouldn't be surprised if Apple backs down on this stance in the near future... they won't risk people abandoning their hardware on this dumb mountain.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 14:05:16'] Let's hope so..  I'm down to buy a few more apple stocks before the split 😝
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 16:58:32'] Probably not this news in isolation, no. However, it's not been a good couple of weeks for the App Store in general if we also include the Microsoft xCloud and Facebook Gaming controversies.Also, last month Tim Cook and the other big tech CEOs (sans Microsoft) had to attend a [congressional hearing on anti-trust](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/). Tim was grilled on the iOS app store commission structure in particular, so it'll be interesting to see how this latest news plays into the bigger picture. I would think we'd have to see congressional action to see significant price action on the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 18:15:41'] Gotta love these posts. People should gave to disclose financial interest on silly ‘questions’ like these. Something like ‘ I hold no positions and do not plan to trade these securities for the next (48?) hours’.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 16:02:23'] Epic Games went against Apple's ToS.I'm not an Apple user; however, if the app store is required and you can't side-load applications, e.g. similar to installing an APK in Android, then Apple may have a hard time defending this anti-competitive business practice. Otherwise, Apple has every right to control a 'safe' App Store so companies like Epic Games can easily distribute games for a fee.I don't believe we'll see anything noticeable until a verdict is made.

First of all for the consumers safety, but also because every app would in a second become free with in-app purchase, and Apple should get some payment. Just not fucking 30% lol

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-14 08:25:51'] the big dip will be if epic wins (because it will have an impact on apple's 30% cut on in-app microtransactions store wide, not just with fortnite.)wouldn't expect too big of a dip simply from announcing the suit.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 14:44:57'] cool. less iPhone sales I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 23:54:07'] This is ridiculous for many reasons.First of all, if EPIC doesn't agree with the AppStore's Terms & Conditions they shouldn't have placed Fortnite there in the first place back in the day. By doing so they've agreed with these terms and they haven't changed since then so what's the deal now?Second, no matter how much is Fortnite popular, it's just a game. One of many. This is not going to change anything.EPIC is clearly doing so because it's a hot topic since Apple was questioned by the US congress lately. They knew it's going to happen because they had a video ready which they posted only a few hours after. Nice try, EPIC.To me the way more interesting case is Apple preventing Spotify and others getting access to their exclusive API. Users are not able to control 3rd party apps through Siri, or they don't have the same level of user experience using AirPods or HomePod. This is way more serious.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 14:16:02'] I wonder if apple will finally open up iOS to allow downloads from web. They are facing heavy pressure about app store antitrust issues, as well as TikTok and WeChat being banned and American companies can't transact with them. This would basically make iPhones useless in china as there would be no way of downloading wechat. If apple allows web downloads, the iPhone wouldn't die in china if WeChat does get banned.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 14:16:54'] How many millions of people are effected by this though??? What happens to those people who have Fortnite already on their iPhone?Pretty disturbing.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-13 19:00:02'] Spotify came out in support of Epic’s lawsuit earlier with a statement calling out Apple for not allowing competition and screwing over consumersThis lawsuit has A LOT of support from big names app developers (it might be possible for other companies to follow along and also sue Apple for anti-competition behaviour) I don’t personally think this will have much of an impact tmrw but I do think Epic will have a strong case and will possibly win the suit so in the future yes this lawsuit could possibly make the stock drop but tomorrow? No I don’t think so

I also use Amazon Alexa (not really AI, but who knows what's considered AI now), and it's incredibly limited in terms of what it can understand (most of the time it's obvious it doesn't really understand what I'm asking).So ya, until I see AI in my actual life, I consider the whole AI mania to be massive hype.

It's not always about whether a company might completely disappear but rather a question of the opportunity cost of having your money in that company versus somewhere else. If other companies come along whose stocks are better supported, you're wasting opportunity. If the stock performance including dividends is not better than inflation, you are losing money. Stock prices aren't where they are strictly because of fundamentals. They are where are because the demand exists. So, will Microsoft or Apple go bankrupt in the next 10 years? No. Could you lose money if you kept your money in them for the next 10 years? Definitely.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 21:14:40'] They’re here to stay. Even Google can’t compete with Apple phone wise, and Microsoft is on every computer that  isn’t Apple. Apples gonna make plays into the electric vehicle world. Microsoft competes with Sony in gaming consoles.  Anything is possible but both companies in my opinion will still be successful for the next 50 years and probably stay on top for another 25.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-07 09:45:44'] nobody knows. it's unthinkable right now, but did anyone think blockbuster would ever go bankrupt 30 years ago? how about polaroid almost a century ago or sears around  the same time? (and on a related note, <a famous film company that we're not allowed to say due to over-moderation and has a name similar to a certain kind of bear> is a shell of it's former self too)time change, and so do companies (especially as high level employees that shape the company come and go). would anyone say that apple is better off under tim cook than it was under steve jobs? that seems exceptionally unlikely. also, with apple specifically don't forget that their positive image is more of a 21rst century thing. for a long time they were viewed as a joke. that didn't really turn around until they used intel chips in their computers, and made the iphone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 21:17:04'] Never say never! But it’s extremely doubtful. Both companies have >$120bn cash on hand. Microsoft owns most every business and school’s OS for the foreseeable future. Apple owns the world of smartphones and their global market is still rapidly expanding. Not to mention if Apple is successful in releasing a high end EV it will only help.As much as I’d like to see Microsoft or windows again, neither company is going anywhere short term. They’re both to the point now of conducting buybacks for the purpose of increasing dividends.Nothing is for sure but the probability of either going under anytime soon is very low.I’m on your same boat of *too big too fail*. I hope of we’re both completely mislead someone could correct it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 21:25:01'] "Never" is a long time, but you are probably correct at 47.Just to compare, think of companies like Xerox and Kodak that had their heyday in the 70s and eventually died or became a acquisition that was a shadow of their former glory. Even more recent, companies like DEC and Sun. Sun was near the peak of it's awesomeness in 2000 and 9 years later got acquired by Oracle for single digit billions.Apple and MSFT are in more of a solid situation than a company like Sun was, but 40 years is a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 21:39:06'] Its not impossible but its extremely unlikely. As of right now there would have to be some major external force to push them to bankruptcy right now.

They don't have any moat except contemporary being popular "luxury" compared to a ghetto Android.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-17 18:48:47'] 5 years sure, but over 20 years is pushing it. In 1989 the top 20 companies by market cap are no longer the top ones today. Things change which is natural. If you believe in tech, just go spy or qqq because youll get exposure to the up and coming companies without needing to guess which ones are going to be the new top dogs in 20 years. Although if i was going to bet which current companies will still reign in 20 years, it would be aapl, msft, goog and amzn.

POST_TEXT: b"Greetings. I'm seeking to source ideas from the wisdom of the crowd. Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:  \n\n\n* **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier. \n* **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty.\n* **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts. Recently started in the hobby but I have the impression that having Shimano component could make-or-bre"

Not only is their core business a razor and blade model where they sell the tasers and then the disposable cartridges but they have expanded into body cameras and high margin software products which are growing very quickly. Their clients are recession resistant (3 to 5 year govt contracts) and they’ve been delivering phenomenal revenue growth. The only competitor they have in the area might be Motorola but it’s not even close. They have the market cornered and clients continue to spend more with them every year.

The move was prompted by high deposit outflows at the bank due to a broader downturn in the startup industry, analysts say.  SVB also forecast a sharper decline in net interest income.All of that spooked a number of prominent venture capitalists, including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Coatue Management and Union Square Ventures, who, according to sources, instructed portfolio businesses to limit exposure and pull their cash from the bank. Other VC firms have asked portfolio companies to at least shift some of their cash away from the bank, while a number have indicated they will stand by SVB.Throughout the day, our liveblog will have the latest developments on the fallout from Silicon Valley Bank.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 11:00:57'] I think it is not the question that why fed wants to break up something; it is the question that why the banks’ risk exposure are so terrible that even raising to a normal rate in history would blow things off. Financial institutions are a bunch of kindergartners who just dont listen, and they know they’ll get bailed out when they screw up—that’s the real problem in the economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 13:28:12'] The TastyTrade guys were talking all last year about the inherent risk of having raised interest rates this quickly, and how higher rates were bound to sniff out a pocket of weakness somewhere in the markets. After 10+ years of ZIRP and QE, there was bound to be mal-investment somewhere. Crypto was the first domino, now this SVB fiasco is probably just another canary in the coal mine.Doubt we've seen the lows in the market unless this remains contained. The real question is, how much counterparty risk is there at SVB? In other words, how much potential contagion is there to come from this?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 18:17:04'] >Many venture capitalists echoed the startup CEO’s sentiment that the SVB collapse felt like a self-fulfilling prophecy created by unnecessary panic. Some likened it to a “Twitter-led bank run,” as the tech community took to social media to spread information, and, often, panic. One prominent technology CEO told CNBC that numerous startup founders were using Twitter and Meta ’s communication service WhatsApp to send each other rapid-fire updates.>One venture capitalist said it was as if someone screamed “fire in a crowded theater where there is no fire.”>“And then when everyone rushes to the door, they knock over the oil lamp and there is a fire and it burns down the building,” the venture capitalist said. “And then that same person [is] standing outside being like, ‘See, I told you so.’”https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/10/silicon-valley-investors-and-founders-express-shock-at-svb-collapse.htmlTbf it seems like the management practices were pretty shit but it's also possible it didn't have to blow up so spectacularly.  Big banks are probably happy to see less competition.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 07:43:18'] Ironically, SIVB going down means a likely slowdown or even pause or even cuts if there is contagion, directly curing the problems it was facing. Even now bond yields are crashing, boosting the value of treasuries in other banks and making them less at risk. That is if there is no contagion, it will likely boost other banks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 15:11:08'] Amazing that mainstream economists ignored these risks.  William White, BIS, wrote about them as far back as 2006.  It's exactly what we're seeing now:"This implies a delicate balancing act for the monetary authorities, in which tightening must be slow enough to avoid destabilising financial markets, but fast enough not to destabilise inflationary expectations."[https://www.bis.org/publ/work205.pdf](https://www.bis.org/publ/work205.pdf)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 06:30:23'] With everything that’s happening with SVB, I’m curious whether this would be legal:Hedge fund shorts/buys puts on SVB.Hedge fund asks its VC startups to withdraw all their funds from SVB.VC startups start pulling out their funds from SVB, causing a bank run as SVB doesn’t have enough short term liquidity to meet the requests for payment.SVB becomes insolvent. Anyone who shorted/bought puts on SVB makes a ton of money.There’s no insider trading violations because the hedge fund ordering the VC startups doesn’t hold any position at SVB?

POST_TEXT: b'Wondering how investors handle their longer term held stocks.  Do you sell occasionally and take profits if you feel the market is going to take a downturn or do you just hold through the waves.  I have a lot of aapl and several other stocks and Im thinking of selling a few hundred of each and re-purchasing during a dip. \n\nI own appl at $70 (I sell CCs and puts to reduce my cost basis).  When aapl has dipped to $120-$130 I tell myself I should have sold at $170 taken profits and rebought.  Since this sell will be long term capital gains the tax wont be a big deal so not worried. \n\nAm I the only investor that holds through the up and downs? Should I sell some and rebuy?  Thank you in advance.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 22:48:08'] Data supports the latter. Most people are terrible timers of the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 20:21:14'] If you knew that you could sell and buyback cheaper, then obviously do that, but you don’t know that, and it’s quite painful to sell and watch it go higher, as it’s psychologically quite hard to buyback at a price that is higher than what you sold at

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 20:11:40'] Never try to time but if say MSFT ran up to 400 and had a inflated pe there becomes a point where the future growth is so priced in the outperform from MSFT to say spy is so marginal I would rather hold spy for the diversification. It’s all about the future growth rate compared to the 10%ish the spy does and what the future growth rate is valued you at for the individual company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 22:23:54'] I only recently bought AAPL, starting at $135. My average is $150. Plan is to hold 20+ years through thick and thin. I would have loved to have bought in at $70! I think it has the potential to still go much higher. Apple isn’t going out of business anytime soon, and they are probably working on things we have not even imagined yet. If/when it ever gets to $1000, you might regret selling it. If it were me, I wouldn’t sell more than 10%. Maybe I’m too optimistic. I don’t think we’ll see the same exponential returns it has had in the past, but it’s still a top pick and worth holding, not for years, but for decades, depending on your age.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 05:17:53'] All stats and data suggest you’ll lose money when actively trading and managing your portfolio. Sell if you can’t stomach the huge swings. Otherwise, use times of falling stock price to fortify positions you have conviction in.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 04:52:24'] Mixed approach: have mostly long-term holds and swing a FEW volatile stocks. If a company is falling hard or going bankrupt, get out and stay out. Even Arch Coal went bankrupt and its stock became worthless.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 09:03:28'] So let's say you bought at $150 in Nov 2021 and sold at $170 in Dec 2021 for a profit. You'd still make more than holding all the way to Apr 2023 which is only $160 now.Long term investing doesn't work when it's not a bull market. I'm not saying to time the market. I'm just saying holding long-term doesn't guarantee a winning strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 12:59:35'] It just depends on how attentive you can be. If you want to swing trade and can check on your portfolio regularly enough to do that, then I'm always going to encourage it. But there is also nothing wrong with dollar-cost-averaging or holding on to stocks for a while if it's a solid stock. Whatever you find makes you the most successful trader bud.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 03:17:29'] Not sure the news is covering this enough but there seems to be a straight up banking collapse in Europe. A bunch of big European banks like Deutsch Bank, Barclays, UBS, Commerzbank etc are nearing or greater than -10% right after European markets opened (Deutsch Bank is at -15% and still free falling).What happens if one these big European banks implodes? I think that unlike SVB, these banks *are* system critical, like the European equivalent of JPM or BAC. And I may be wrong, but I don’t think Europe *can* afford to bailout these banks. For example afaik the Swiss gov acknowledged that UBS is so big in proportion to Swiss GDP, tax revenue etc that the Swiss central bank literally cannot bailout UBS.Will the Fed offer to help bailout a failing European bank, to prevent a chain effect on our banks? Can the Fed even legally do so with what’s in some way our money? We can afford it I think (see how much the Fed added to its balance sheet just last week alone, it’s more than the GDP of some European countries), but would Americans even be okay with it?

Drilling rigs in the US increased but barely:> The total rig count rose to 758 this week—88 rigs higher than the rig count this time in 2022 and 317 rigs lower than the rig count at the beginning of 2019, prior to the pandemicBut, and correct me if I'm wrong, more bullish news is that frac spreads rose significantly. In other words, more drilling crews 'completed' the work on drilled but not-completed wells. This means more oil can come online in the immediate future, but on a slightly longer time scale, means the DUC (drilled but uncompleted) well inventory decreases.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 03:07:46'] Question about the lending program of the FED.The FED hands out a loan to the banks and the collateral are the long duration bonds of the banks.  The banks need to pay the loan back + interest  and the depositors can withdraw their money.The FED isn't buying BONDS like during QE but they are handing out loans so depositors can withdraw money and spend money in the real economy?  Is this a form of QE?I understand, if the FED didn't take action this would cause a lot of panic in the financial world.

I hope I learned my lesson this time about “sure thing” puts, because the stock market is dumb and I’m dumb too for thinking a negative earnings stock would ever have a down day.It’s 95% returns in the past three months. So annoyed that this stock is almost 100% returns while my good, safe, fcf are taking hit after hit.Thought I’d rant to people who get it.

POST_TEXT: b'Good evening everyone and thank you so much for reading my posts. There are debates everywhere abou TSLA valuation so I am not here to go into that. It should be noted that TSLA now has a market cap higher than the combination of Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda all combined. It should also be noted that Toyota alone sells nearly 10 million cars and Tesla 500k..\n\nThis post is not about that thoughhowever Cathie Wood says that TSLA should be worth 3,000 easy, in her base case. \\[Mind you she just dumped along with insiders that sell every day of the week check form 4\\] Whatever is the case if TSLA is 3,000 a share it will rival the largest company in the world AAPL. Nearly 2.5 trillion\n\nTSLA is thought as of the car/tech of the futureMany believe that APPLE is the best innovator It has been rumored over a year that Apple has plans to possibly team up with a car manufacturer and make an APPLE car.\n\nSo the question is simple. If both cars come out, both cars are near the same pr'
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 19:16:26'] I have a hard time believing Apple will make a car.  Software, electronics, and AI for cars I can believe, but not a full vehicle.  It goes against Apple's very business model, which is high margin.  Tim Cook has gotten rid of profitable products simply because the margins are not high enough.  Right now Apple could make an Apple branded monitor with the same design motif as its laptops and sell tons of them.  It would not even have to stock them in Apple stores, maybe just a demo model with ordering online.  It got rid of monitors because the it is a low margin product.  In fact because of low margins, Cook has basically disassembled what used to be the Apple hardware ecosystem with its printers, routers, monitors, and such.It does not make sense for Apple to get into a business that requires huge capital outlays, is very cyclical, and often has low to no profits

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 08:25:02'] on the car front, i'd expect both will be nice vehicles at comparable price points. that means it depends on which one makes a nicer looking convertible. my eclipse isn't going to last forever.i'm not completely sold on the roadster and hate how the top is just a glorified sunroof [with a permanently fixed back](https://images.cars.com/cldstatic/wp-content/uploads/tesla-roadster-oem.jpg) rather than something that completely retracts.on the color front, it's definitely an added bonus that where apple historically has been big into color choices, it seems likely they'll have a nice orange.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 18:50:59'] You’re right with the view in the car front for Tesla. Tesla is still much more than that with its battery tech. But we’ll have to see how that materialises too. Tesla has to be evaluated as more than just a car company.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 20:47:45'] Of the two options, Apple.  I like that Musk has forced the world’s hand into going EV, but at this point I didn’t think I’d ever buy a Tesla.  I’m probably 5+ years out from buying a new vehicle, and I fully expect better options at that point.That said, I’ve had Apple hardware I haven’t been too pleased with.  So I probably wouldn’t buy their car either.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 23:09:35'] I'll go with one from VW, BMW, Mercedes or Audi once the battery safety issue is completely resolved.Connected EV first and foremost is a car. It took Tesla 10 yrs trials and errors to mass produce an economical EV and Tesla still has car quality issues besides the industry wide battery safety issue. I just don't see how those phone companies can catch up quickly. Yes they know infotainment, software, telecommunications better than traditional car manufacturers for sure, but they have never had any experience building a robust car. On the other hand, traditional car manufacturers aren't just waiting there to be disrupted - they are working really hard to reinvent their own industry right now.

They’re definitely on the move.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 18:34:35'] I’d pretend to be really interested to evaluate the specs……(and then ignore or justify vehemently all the contras related to Apple) - Apple, all in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 18:48:54'] Where will Apple get it’s batteries to build its car? Literally the whole EV revolution is battery cell constrained. Tesla has locked up all the major contacts with cell manufacturers and are in the midst of producing their own cell. Unless Apple is awaiting the fabled solid state batteries it’s going to be a long road before they can touch Tesla’s numbers. Even then the solid state battery will need 2-3 years at minimum to ramp up and that’s optimistic.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 18:35:22'] Honestly I would be concerned about an apple car, and wether or not they have some plans to make it obsolete. Or not last  like how they have sent software updates to your I phone to make the battery not last as long to encourage you to go out and buy the new one. Not super ethical.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 04:36:03'] None of them because both will have a business model to sell you SaaS and apps. Now most people buy a car and are able to sell it with all its technology. With Apple or Tesla you will sell your car without the most important features like self driving. We should buy electric car from legacy maker. Alternative: Tesla and Apple car should be way cheaper to account for less resale value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 23:54:53'] esla's you have to take them to them to get them fixed, and I would imagine apple will be the same way, so neither. I'm gonna stick to public transportation for now, and if I do ever get a car, it will be one that I can shop around for mechanics when something goes wrong.&#x200B;As much as I like Tesla, the idea that you should have to wait a month for a part is ridiculous, many many people with a car need it to get to work, and if they don't have their car they can either uber/rent a car or be fired for not showing up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 19:49:29'] AAPL for sure. Why would I buy a Tesla ? The cars are so ugly anyways. If I wanted style I would rather buy BMW or Audi. If I wanted cheap I’ll buy Japanese. So AAPL wins against TSLA

POST_TEXT: b"Noob here, sorry if dumb question. It seems like Apple did great in earnings and is dead-set on making this EV thing work. Why isn't its stock budging? I'm tempted to YOLO my life savings into it but I know I'm too dumb to actually have the whole picture"
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 15:21:07'] Yoloing into AAPL isn't even yoloing tbhEdit:(unless they're options)
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 15:15:06'] Apple is a weird stock.  It can stay flat for a while and then have a nice catalyst. If you look it over the last 4 years, it’s generally up 50% or more every year. I think there’s some good catalysts coming (EV, AR, their new M1 chips, increased services revenue, etc.)  Analysts have targets of 160-175 which is pretty nice at the current price.   Not sure what to think about your YOLO. If you’re a long term investor, AAPL is going to do fine.  If you want faster growth, maybe look elsewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 20:05:42'] Apple has enough cash where if they’re not the next best thing they can buy the next best thing. That in itself makes it a safe bet
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 19:46:32'] Huge AAPL guy, they’re cash position alone is worthy of investing in if you’re looking for a company that would have to blow it big time to go under.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 22:21:43'] It’s just did a 4:1 split, is at a bargain price, it pays a dividend every quarter, has billions in cash on hand, makes stuff people use, has a huge deal with providers..If you had to put money in one stock, AAPL is the safest by a mile IMO. Set it and forget it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 19:28:41'] Just ducking hold haha it will go up if you wait. Buffet trimmed some profits from AAPL but still has it  9% of his portfolio 🤷 also, I'm holding microsoft.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 20:24:49'] It has a huge market cap. It’s harder for a stock to move when it’s already such a big company and kicking ass in many areas. So when they get great news (that still hasn’t come fully to fruition), it’s not going to pop like for instance a penny stock would.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 23:58:02'] You really can't YOLO into AAPL, as it's not really a YOLO. Apple is worth more than the GDP of most countries. You buy Apple and just let it run. Enjoy your 100% gains in 2-4 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 15:49:14'] My guess is it gets pushed down a hair more before shooting back up to 145 - 150 and going further once something is announced with an EV partner - seems the market doesn't like uncertainty with the ev talks even though its all just pushing headlines right now really wont have any impact for sometime but it seems that whoever they choose will send it up so who knows. That could weigh it down till it leaves the news cycle or till its announced maybe later this year. In general seems that the stock likes to go up and then retract and lately looks like volume has been decreasing, I see that as short term investors getting out..Short of any developments if your a Max Pain theory believer the options contracts seem to have it hovering at that 132-135 range for the next couple weeks....

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 15:43:14'] It takes a lot to bring up the price of a company at 2 trillion dollars. A 10% move is 200billion in market cap which in itself is more than most companies are worth.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 15:24:42'] AAPL is basically priced for perfection at this point. It's going to take a lot for it to move up significantly. Don't you remember that run it made after the split announcement? Nothing fundamentally changed about the company.

It's not safe if you need the money immediately (which is what an emergency fund is for).  I'd say don't spend your emergency fund money on stocks at all.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-19 18:18:08'] Depends on your time frame. If you absolutely, positively HAVE to have the $5000 available in the next year leave it in cash. If you don't need it for 5-10 years and are willing to accept a 95%+ chance of having a lot more money in that time period vs. A 5% chance of having a little less... then put it in Apple and don't worry about any temporary corrections.

POST_TEXT: b"AAPL's forward P/E ratio is 28.9, much higher compared to its 5 year average of 15.9. The stock is much pricier compared to how the market has valued it in the past few years. The latest bull run to $150 has a lot of high expectations riding behind it. It's going to need to do more than marginally beat earnings estimates to support its current value. How do you think the price will behave after earnings tomorrow? Are we going to see a repeat of the past few earnings? Curious if anyone has some insight to share."
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 13:57:22'] Many companies are above their 5-year average PE ratios right now so why is that statistic relevant for Apple? Just an exuberant market right now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 14:05:03'] Apple is not the only company that is valued higher than their previous 5 year average; that can be said about most companies.A lot of new investors and money entered the market last year and that new money has to go somewhere so you really can't compare Apple or any company to their previous 5 year average anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 18:21:37'] Apple hasn’t disappointed yet and I’m certainly not betting against them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 13:52:07'] I'm a professional so I'm going to make a 20 minute YouTube video stating that AAPL will either go up or go down before, during, and after earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 14:07:48'] If TSLA was any indication today, we are once again back to good earnings affecting the stock very little. If the earnings meet or beat, I expect very slight green after hours.As for current valuation being justified, I am slightly nervous. My doubts don't stem from their core hardware business. The iPhone, iPad and new Macs should continue to sell very well. Just looking around, I know a bunch of people who got a new iMac just now (women seem to LOVE the color options).My concern is Apple TV+ turning into a money sink. I canceled it because I don't have time to watch their content as it's not good enough. I also have no desire to have multiple stagnating subscription services. Everybody has Disney and Netflix, and Netflix just got crushed a bit.Where does this leave Apple? When will it start to show in the earnings and what will be the consequences of it? Producing content is expensive, and without content the service is dead in the water.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 20:38:09'] Apple will eventually make a big splash in the automotive industry. Battery and sensor  technology. Packaging Apple Music with iCloud and Apple TV at a competitive price to increase subscriptions to all and poach from services like Spotify.

Every year they put out a new or upgraded product to sop up money from folks with disposable income, e.g. Air Max. Their M1 chips are fantastic and many folks are chomping at the bit to get a pro-level ARM laptop. They can easily raise prices of their phones every year and people keep buying them.I know services is the key to their future growth, but that's got nowhere to go but up.I don't like playing earnings with options--been burned too many times.

Its now around $134, so 130x - 500x.I did better - I bought AAPL in 1985, and my split adjusted cost basis is about $0.11/share.There's more though - AAPL paid dividends for a while in the 80s(?), and also more recently. Re-investing those adds quite a bit.I'm not an Apple millionaire yet, but my $500 investment is now well over $600k

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:03:15'] I don’t know why you would sell, you’re just solidifying your losses. If you bought Apple for the long-term you’re fine. Set it and forget it
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:03:05'] Lol “buy high, sell low” - how novel.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:08:54'] You put money into one of the best managed companies in the world. Be happy you now have a very small piece of that company. Hold onto it. Look at their chart over the last 15 years. Take a deep breath and have a glass of whiskey.... and remember, be sure to keep enough cash on the side so you don’t have to sell in a panic!
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:06:26'] It’s ok. Breathe. Stocks go up and down, but good companies make money, so they trend higher over time. Apple will be fine. Don’t sell - you’ll regret it when you miss a rally and kick yourself for crystallizing your losses. Stick it out.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:02:11'] I would just hold, unless you’re trying to day trade it’s not worth selling at a loss.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:46:10'] You thought it was worth buying at $115, why is it suddenly not worth holding at $105? The market fluctuates. That's the nature of the beast. AAPL is a good company and will continue to make money in the long run. Be patient. If you can't handle it, wait until it moves back up to $115 and get out and put your cash back in savings. You don't have the stomach for investing.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:08:15'] Hold and average down. Expect their price to shoot up again when iPhone 12 is announced and the day before they release their earnings report.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 11:55:38'] >The way I see it, it would have been better to sell at a loss a week ago, saved $1,000 bucks, then buy again once AAPL started to gain.Google "wash sale rule". If you sell for a loss and then rebuy within 30 days, the irs thinks you're trying to harvest a tax loss and will just go ahead and add your loss back to your cost basis.Regardless, trying to time the market in this way is exactly what leads to buying high and selling low. You can see today that selling a week ago would have been beneficial but what if the stock had started going up again right after you sold? We can't see into the next week today, and you don't know if the price will start marching back up starting tomorrow or continue into the toilet.Because we can't predict the future, unless there is a relevant headline or announcement that changes the long term outlook of a stock, **you want to use times like this to buy more and lower your cost basis**.Unfortunately it sounds like you don't have more money to buy more. You can avoid this in the future by starting a new position with a small buy and adding to it over time, and learning about indicators like RSI which can help inform you on when a stock is likely overbought and oversold. You went in with 100% of your cash when the RSI was above 70 which is a huge no-no.But that's the past and your job now is to 1. learn from this experience and 2. not panic sell.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:08:59'] ^this, + you never know when the trend reverts, there was some good news about apple: 5nm chips, more affordable watch, apple one (Spotify is afraid it will take big share of earnings), apple fitness, expected price increases to 140$, iPhone will be announced in 2-3 weeks. I think it is now more of panic selling.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:56:57'] You just discovered the age old wisdom of buying high and selling low, if you now do this every time you buy into any stock you will get a guaranteed return of -25% p. a.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:06:09'] It’s not a loss until you sell. It’s Apple, you’ll be fine. If you can, buy the dips! Average down
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 16:09:09'] These types of posts are disappointing.It appears that you haven't invested long term but I'm guessing if I reviewed your post history, you talk about investing long term.You panicking suggests you invested money you can't afford to lose.You need to understand a wash sale before selling and immediately rebuying.You FOMO'd (Fear of Missing Out) at an ATH (All Time High).  A slight pullback was more likely than not.Lastly, you are trying to time the market and you will fail 90% of the time.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:12:25'] Yeah after you sell it, I'm 100 percent sure it will rally then you will fomo and then you will enter again then it will tank again. Buy high sell low is the strategy. Lol. I mean it's Apple. The chances of Apple of going bankrupt is like zero.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 12:03:38'] Never invest money you are not comfortable losing. I don’t invest money by the thousands or hundreds like some people can. I invest maybe a hundred a month or so. But I do so little because I look at with the mindset of never seeing that money again. Rule 1. Can I invest this $100 and be okay as if I just set it on fire? If yes then I’m good to invest that. If no then don’t invest it.Rule 2. I don’t invest to short or make quick profits. I like to think I invest for the years to come. Example, some people buy Tesla stock short term for quick profits...I bought some Tesla a few years ago for $300 and people called me a retard when it went down to $180 something. I considered selling when it hit $600.  No way it could go up further right? I decided to hold on. Enjoy the ride. Then it went up to almost $2,300 then split. Key point is only invest money that you are fine with losing. Worst case is you do for sure lose it. Best case is you strike gold.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:05:49'] You don’t lose anything when buying stocks unless that company bankrupts. Do you think APPLE will bankrupt soon? :)))

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:32:36'] Feel your pain dude. I'm in at $126. But it's Apple, with 5G around the corner their one of the best tech companies on the planet and are sure to capitalize. Just DCA down. I'm waiting to see if it goes sub $100 and may pick up more. That's what makes these red days a little easier
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:36:20'] I bought MSFT early Feb at around 185.  By March it went as low as mid-130s.  Now it's upper 190s which was 15% down a few weeks ago.   Just hold unless the reason why you bought AAPL has changed.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 12:15:02'] Don't buy stocks in one big chunk unless it's some sort of day trade play, DCA down over the longest period of time you can. Especially during the choppy Fall months/when we are clearly in the middle of a correction.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 11:04:39'] When buying stocks, think of the money you're putting into the stock as being "lost" and anything you get back out of it as a bonus.  That way I feel good about any money I have left from the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 11:05:28'] I would absolutely hold. Its Apple we're talking about, not some random company you took a gamble on. The tech sector has been doing worse in the last couple of weeks, and Apple took a hit as well. But going forward, once things calm down a little - it will bounce back. You are considering selling too early, hold it for a year or two before you make a decision on these blue chip companies.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 11:34:38'] THERE WILL BE RED DAYS. You can't panic every time there is one.When you bought those stocks, were you planning on holding long-term? If so, then this week is a blip in the grand scheme of things.Do you think AAPL will **never** recover? If so, then sell immediately. I obviously think it will recover and go back up. Look at any of it's chart thats longer than a month.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 11:52:35'] You’re panicking, it’s natural. Apple is a good company with a strong brand, plenty of cash and promising technologies.Do NOT sell out of fear. You’ll make much more long term holding it out and maximizing your gains by not paying high taxes and trying to time the market.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 11:57:17'] yup I bought 30 grand worth at like 130 dollars a share..I am down 4 grand lol

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 12:46:01'] Unless you need the money right now, don't touch it. It'll be up again in a few weeks, and you will have not lost anything. :)
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 13:06:05'] you haven't made or loss anything unless you actually get rid of it. Do you NEED the money right now? Were you expecting to buy and sell within a couple weeks originally?  Just let it ride...Apple will go back up, give it time.  If you sell, you will have lost thousands..only to buy at a lower position with less money.  Again, you haven't lost anything, only virtually.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 14:44:21'] Good strategy. Buy high sell low.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 16:00:32'] The rise was unjustified. The stock doubled but the underlying numbers weren't even remotely close to that. Also, it absolutely beasted after announcing a split.Let's see if it fills the gap at 96. I'm in for a bounce if it reaches there.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 18:15:12'] Nothing is a loss until you actually sell. just ride the wave
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 22:08:09'] First lesson you learned I guess is to spread your buy. Don't put all your money in one go, buy some today, then next month, then in 3 months and so on, this will allow you to have a better control over your average cost, take advantage of the market corrections and teach you patience.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-19 00:35:06'] Apple isn’t a stock you look at each week, and think “I am losing money”. You only “lose” money if you sell it. It is a stock you look at again in 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-03 06:24:58'] Apple recently announced their plans to enter the automobile industry.. Tesla's stocks were as low as $10 back in 2010. The current price is +$850 so hold and see what happens in the next decade!
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:04:35'] I bought 10 stocks the second the split happened at $130 a piece and now they’re $110 a piece. I feel your pain
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:03:49'] I’d just hold onto them. As long as you have a long time horizon and a willingness to buy more when the price drops. With this year. The price could go up another 100% for no reason.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 10:04:46'] me too bro. i feel ur pain
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-19 02:47:48'] Apple as a business is fundamentally strong. I believe that you would most probably make profits in the long term.I think there is a better alternative to your proposed solution. As you already hold the share of Apple, you could do a covered call at a price lot higher than what you would be comfortable selling the stock.For example, if you had bought the stock at $118 and you are happy to sell the stock at $200. Sell a 45 days to expiry call option at a strike of $200.Possible scenarios at the expiry of the option:**Scenario 1 - Apple is trading at a price below the strike price of the option (let's say $130 as an example)**You get to keep the premium received on selling the call option (minus the brokerage charges) and nothing to lose.**Scenario 2 - Apple is trading at a price above the strike price of the option (let's say $210 as an example)**Profit made = $200 (strike price) - $118 (price at which you bought) + **premium received by selling the option** \- brokerage charges\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The only lost opportunity in this trade setup is that if Apple really shoots up a lot more than the call option strike price, you lose out on the extra profit that could have been made by selling it at that price. To increase your odds of such a thing not happening, you could select a strike price that you think Apple stock most probably cannot reach till the expiry. In the above example, Apple reaching $200 in the next 45 days has very little probability. This would allow you to make some money (premium).Finally, as a trader one must not care about which direction the stock (or market) moves. You must be able to make profit in any scenario.Hope this helps.

You'll miss the reverse.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 12:38:30'] I'm buying more since it's correcting and on sale now.  Holding at least until iPhone announcement day when it should/might go back up.  But Apple is a long buy and hold play.  Congrats on owning shares of a good company.I know all that red makes it looks like you're losing money, but you'll make it all back and more when the stock goes back up.  Which it should, solid company. Do some research on the share price analysts are giving it $140/share or more?  It's not like its going down because of a bad inherent company flaw. More like a tech sector  market correction. And if that's stressful now, please consider the market will be volatile the next couple of months at least until after the election, maybe into the new year.  FYI - If you do decide to sell, check out Investopedia for a definition of a WASH sale.  My bad attempt is if you sell and lose money, you have to wait 30 days before you can repurchase at a lower price, or they'll add your original share price into your new shares.  Google it for a much better, but important, explanation.  As Tim Allen said in Galaxy Quest:  "Never Give Up! Never Surrender!"
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 12:43:15'] I think the real question you should be asking yourself is this "Why am I investing in a single stock in the stock market?" Did you buy AAPL because of it's fundamentals? If so, those haven't changed.When did you plan on selling? If AAPL would have had a 5% gain would you have sold? 30% gain?If you were to sell now and buy again later, at what price would you buy? When would you sell? Why would you buy and sell at these prices?Was this something you planned on holding for a long time? If so, what does it matter what the price is right now?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 12:57:41'] Keep In mind that if you sell a stock for a loss (like you would) and then buy again within 30 days, you are violating the wash sale rule meaning that you would have to pay capital gains when you buy and it goes back up but you wouldn't be able to deduct the loss so you could pay an effective tax rate of 50-60 percent when the stock does go back up... at least thats the way I understand it but someone pipe in if I've got this wrong.  In this case, even if it went down another 10 and you avoided that temporary loss, you would have to pay even more on the way up.Its a heads they win tails you lose for the government.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 14:42:47'] Do you have at least 100 shares? If so, you can start writing call options way OTM and slowly collect premium to help offset the losses. September’s generally the worst month of the year for the market (but past performance isn’t indicative of future performance, etc)
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 14:46:20'] You should probably hold. the problem is by the time it is obvious that apple is rising again you may very well miss most of the rally. It is true if you literally already knew about the upcoming decline you would  have been better selling(technically better opening a short rather than selling since that would let you keep the long position so it will convert to a long term capital gain sooner) but it is difficult to predict and if you mess up the timing it is easy to lose more income trying to time the market than just hanging tight.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 19:25:52'] Don't sell your AAPL if you plan on rebuying it. If it doesn't dip any harder you are just losing out on gains and further losing even more money when you rebuy less shares at a higher cost.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 19:51:15'] You don’t know what the market or AAPL will do next week. Just decide if you want to own it now. Another way to look at it is:Would you buy it today, at this price, if you didn’t already have as much as you have?Or... if you sell it, what will you do with the cash? Sit on it? Buy something else?You unfortunately learned some good lessons:1) don’t buy after huge gains unless you are ready for a pull back.  2) think long term - don’t be a trader, don’t watch the price every day, unless that’s your game (and you know how to play it). 3) don’t compound one mistake with another (sell now, sell low). 4) Think of your long term approach, your broad investment options, and diversify! (index,  ETF’s, your own basket of stocks?). Long term, you’ll be fine.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 23:16:28'] 2 scenarios mate:1. You dont look at apple stock for 1 year and this wont matter in the slightest that it dropped. 2. You sell now based on firm understanding of the market, their 8/10k fillings and marco economisc combined with a bit of human physcology and throw in some techinal analysis and theeeen you buy in lower when youve made a calculated assessment of when apple bottoms out..Number1 scenario is almost foolproof (maybe extend the 1 year to 5years)Number2 leaves a lot of fomo risk, i.e. you seeing it bounce up in 5 days buying in again and then selling when it drops the day after.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-19 05:03:12'] Well I would say depends on your level of confidence and experience. Many people are saying aapl is different and will continue to grow. Some people are saying it was already at 2 trillion market cap so how much more can it grow. Can it double from there ? Nobody knows. I would say if you are new and have not looked at historical averages aapl trades at are not much confident. Go with index funds or etfs. Way less risk than just buying a single stock at it's all time high valuations.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-19 05:25:33'] I wouldn’t sell if it’s long term. But based on TA and a look at the charts. Apple has more room to fall. It lost its support level of 107.89 on Friday....nothing but air between there and the $95 area which was the gap up from earnings. Not saying it has to happen but there is a lot of weakness on the chart so just prepare yourself for it.

You just didn't have any idea that the value could possibly go down?Here's an investing pro-tip: for every position you enter, have a plan to exit. The plan could involve a material change in the company's operations, the stock price, global economics, or whatever. Just come up with a plan for when you will sell. Then stick to that plan.I tend to buy and hold my investments and I've been in this exact situation MANY times. I always hold. But my investment timeframe is long-term. I can't even imagine selling a position that loses a few percent after a week.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 13:03:48'] Nothing wrong with selling now, staying out for 30 days so that you can take the loss on your taxes, then buying in at a later date. The primary risk is that it jumps a lot between now and when you manage to repurchase it. Next earnings is October 30th, although they will probably do an iPhone announcement before then, and I'm personally waiting to hear news about the first ARM powered MACs, as my trusty 2013 MacBook Pro recently took a spill and now the audio is crummy.

POST_TEXT: b"Okay, somebody school me here.  I have a theory, break it apart.  Educate me.  That's what we are mostly here for.\n\nFed Rates increase, makes it more expensive to borrow money and develop for businesses like AAPL.  Valuations drop, etc.\n\nAt one point, AAPL was considering developing their own semiconductors, wireless components, etc, that they currently outsource from AVGO.\n\nWith the fed increasing rates this year, does that have the potential to further solidify AAPL's dependence on AVGO for another year, making AVGO a good buy at sub $600 right now?\n\nI remember reading a report that around 15 B or 20% of AVGO's business was from supplying AAPL.\n\nBut anyway, with the current climate and increasing fed rates this year (which might even be as low as 0.25% so potentially negligible), does it make it reasonable to assume that AAPL may hold off on spending on that semiconductor development for a while, making AVGO a pretty good shot at below $600 entry right now?\n\nHopefully I'm making sens"

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-13 15:04:21'] Avgo is the primary wifi chip provider for aapl. Previously aapl had started an attempt to create their own wifi development team. From what I've heard last from inside the industry most of the wifi engineers on aapl has been transitioned to other projects so in the near term aapl has suspended their wifi development. If I recall correctly aapl has also signed a multi year deal with avgo to still continue using their wifi chips.

That said, each of these companies have beat the market during the extended post-2008 bull run.

It's probably no coincidence that these two are the only FAAMG stocks beating the market YTD. Then there's also TSLA, NVDA, NFLX and AMD each of which have had monster years so far.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 01:35:09'] They are overvalued but were considered "safe" (except for FB) so they are the last to reach top. That's typical of bubbles: first they kill speculative fare, then small caps and growth and finally they shoot down the blue chips. At that point the whole market starts to tank since there isn't anything else left to park money into.For the past year they've been parking money into real estate and commodities which also became overvalued, so the only option left is to go abroad for those funds that are allowed to invest internationally. Though we have splendid bubbles in foreign real estate and in some emerging markets such as India as well.I think that they are gradually repositioning in expectation of a crash next year as the Fed starts tapering off and then increasing rates.Of course retail will be the last to know. When the market starts tanking in earnest and hedge funds are done taking their short positions then they will push doom and gloom through the financial media to scare retail into panic selling. A trick as old as the world but it never fails.It should be interesting to see how crypto fares in all this. I think that it will crash and burn despite the propaganda that it is "digital gold". The "everything bubble" will likely end up in the "everything crash".I also expect that the China story will start to change. After all, it is the only major market that looks undervalued (at least in the tech sector), though Chinese real estate is not a good place to be. All that depending on some toning down of geopolitical tensions.

Biggest reason they stopped growing is because they made bad calls and couldn't innovate. Apple (M1 chipset) , Amazon (AWS) , and Facebook (Metaverse) have not shown any sign of not innovating.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 11:46:39'] I picked up three shares this week but I'm holding off on buying more for a while. I just started investing recently so I want to see if I can snag more for a better price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 06:51:28'] >They are reducing advertisers ability to track you. While good for consumers, this is an argument against strong stock performance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 06:34:01'] Do you believe it’s worth 50% worth more than januari 2020? if so it’s worth your buy. If you think it’s going to crash more (which I think tbh) I would wait a while.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 12:42:50'] Apple historically has never really been a bad buy. I’d say now or next week is probably about as good as it will get.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-08 19:42:28'] it’s a good time to start building a position perhaps enter into 1/ 4 of your intended position now and build over the next few weeks

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 07:00:06'] Yes!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 13:57:21'] I bought last month. It’s down a bit now but sure to go up. Apples going no where.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 05:35:34'] AAPL will probably recede as the old bond influx goes back to bonds from equities. Apes should expect the tide to go out, affecting all ship. The tide will swing back, but do your own DD and watch the vine your swinging from and be discerning. Personally waiting for the talking heads to scream and cry before I go banana picking.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 07:15:12'] Good friday??? The fuck is that???
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 15:14:12'] Grab a drink, for I have some labor market data to share. Folks, we've been glooming about bank credit, Fed rate hikes, and inflation. But despite all that, we have *fantastic* trends in the labor market that all of us should celebrate.----I posted a few months ago about how tech unemployment actually *decreased* from Dec 2022 to January 2023. [Here is the comment I made in mid February](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/112uzdy/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_feb_15_2023/j8po699/). The summary:> In January [2023] the tech unemployment rate fell to 1.5% from 1.8% in December, according to CompTIA's analysis. That same firm released their update following today's job numbers. It seems it went from 1.5% to 2.2% in February, and then stayed constant at 2.2% in March. I can't access their full report. But even despite that, job posting increased to 316K.> Tech industry employment, covering all workers employed by technology companies, experienced a **modest decline of an estimated 839 jobs last month**. Telecommunications accounted for the largest share of the decline at -3,100 positions, which was offset by gains in cloud infrastructure, tech services and software.            > > **Employer job postings for tech positions increased by 76,546 month-over-month, to a total for March of nearly 316,000. This represents the highest level of employer hiring activity as measured by job postings in seven months.**> > **Technology employment across all industry sectors increased by an estimated 197,000 positions** for the month, according to CompTIA’s analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics #JobsReport data. The **unemployment rate** for tech occupations held **steady at 2.2%**.So yeah, there is no reason to doom over the tech sector's labor market. Unemployment is 40% smaller than the overall unemployment rate; this is among some of the highest paid occupations; layoffs concentrated among large tech companies that overhired but offer incredibly strong severance packages.---In other good news, we are near/at [*record high* levels of Black prime age employment rates](https://i.imgur.com/ej2Pxmj.png): "Now at 78.1%, 0.6% above the pre-pandemic peak, and now just 0.6% from the all-time high in 1999." For the first time years and maybe even ever, [Black employment rates are higher than White employment rates](https://i.imgur.com/0YxTRwY.png), although age differences in the population between demographics plays a major role in this. If you adjust for age it's slightly lower instead. Here are decades of [Black unemployment rates](https://i.imgur.com/BauLPwl.png).[Prime age employment (across all Americans) highest in *20 years*](https://i.imgur.com/2z9WD0R.png). As pointed about by Joseph Politano on Twitter:> - Highest prime-age employment rate in decades. > - Highest female prime-age employment rate ever. > - Highest Black prime-age employment rate ever. > - Highest Asian prime-age employment rate ever. A strong labor markets benefits the disabled too: Just marvel [at this chart](https://i.imgur.com/XaC4voE.png).----Wealth inequality. Is inflation hitting the poor the hardest? Probably yeah. But guess what a strong labor market does? [Increases wealth for the poorest Americans](https://i.imgur.com/CgBD15v.png).> > Wealthiest 0.1% of Americans saw 5.0% of their wealth disappear from the quarter before the Fed started hiking rates in 2022Q1 to 2022Q4> > The next 0.9% saw 7% of their wealth disappear> > In contrast, the least-wealthy half of Americans saw their (much smaller) wealth rise 17%--Arin Dube points out:> It took around 12 years for prime-age (25-54yo) employment-to-population rate to recover after the recession following the financial crisis.> It took around 3 years after the recession following pandemic.---Is inflation eating away at wages? Not at the bottom quantiles of earnings! [Figure](https://i.imgur.com/uyBYew0.png).---Takeaway: Don't bet against the American consumer. More of us are working, across all races, ability, genders. Our wages are going up, especially those at the bottom quantiles of earnings, and faster than inflation for those lower income earners. That's a lot of disposable income ready to pour right back into the economy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 14:13:48'] I have a question about shorting a stock with low price. For example if you short a stock at 0.50$ and goes 0.25$ do you get +0.25$ per share or +100% cause the price got down in half? If it's the first, why people keep shorting stocks with low price? Do they bet on reverse split or even a bankrupt?

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 10:00:19'] Apple’s desktop and laptop market share is going to skyrocket once they release their full line up of M1(X) chips. I fully believe Apple is the only company that’s capable of their level of computing power for the prosumer market for the next 2-3 years. No one else is even close to having the type of integration that Apple offers.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 08:27:37'] AAPL is always a solid 12+month play. It's one of the safest places to park my money, I feel, when I'm too busy to be actively trading.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 11:52:10'] Now is a great time to buy aapl.  Their last quarter had huge sales.  +30-40% yoy.  Their servers had trouble with new activations over Christmas because there was “increased volume” - do you know how many activations there has to be to slow down all of their servers?! A ton. Plus, there’s this whole “stimulus” thing.  The 70% of people who don’t have to use it for bills immediately, will spend it on upgrading their phone or buying Apple products.  Apple has great revenue, and great margins, and a great fan base, and great brand recognition, and a good dividend, and a great R&D sector (don’t think massive innovation, think about how they expanded beyond just iPods since 2004 & are now in web services, maps, advertising, finance, data security, cloud services, fitness, etc).
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 08:38:04'] I think it's a good time to long now. $AAPL earning will come out soon and is expected to outperform predictions.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 08:30:22'] If you're going for years and decades, but it any time. Personally, I'd use DCA and just keep buying it over time. New architecture, move towards fitness, wearables etc - Apple will do well in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 17:12:52'] Apple has been beating the snp500 and nasdaq since 2011. Its a buy and hold in my books. M1 chip in phones and macbooks (faster and more battery efficient), apples ev car, and apple fitness are reasons to keep holding. Apple is a powerhouse brand, it has social status appeal; i dont see that changing anytime soon, they are dominating the phone, tablet, laptop market, and making $$$ off their services. Look at all these bs ev stocks skyrocking, apples ev as a product will crush those chinesse ev’s techwise, and id argue that they would give tesla some tough competition.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 08:40:57'] Just buy in a schedule and don’t worry about timing. AAPL has given consistent returns now for two decades.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 12:21:14'] Their M1 CPU is something that changed the computing era. And I'm not talking about one of the last iSomething Intel crappy processors that are always identical.Go view some youtube videos about these new Macs, they are just stunning.Microsoft is already working on the ARM version of Windows and many more will get this path, as the advantages are enormous.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 13:42:03'] Its my largest position and I really think they have something with the new cheaper SE 2020, I know a lot of people who bought that phone, price for value is great.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 17:33:09'] the best time was yesterday, the second best is today. APPL is a long hold for a couple years. It just constantly goes up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 08:08:50'] I’d say so, if you have any doubts don’t put as much in and go for an etf instead.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 09:52:03'] Android accounts for 72% of the market share where as iOS has 26%. So if Apple is worth 2 trillion today what would it be if took more of the market share and was 50/50 with android. Sky’s the limit for Apple
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 10:46:51'] I'd make a few regular purchases over the next 3 months
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 18:18:31'] at this time last year, i was extremely skeptic on apple due to them not doing anything new and innovative in quite some time with their updated products mainly being slight improvements rather than major leaps. on top of that, there has been decaying market share in the mobile market.now, with the rumors of them looking to get into the autonomous car market, i definitely see a lot of potential upside for apple as a long term hold. that's the biggest news coming out of apple since the iphone was first announced.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 18:32:37'] Buy now before earnings and then buy more after earnings. You have 6 days.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 12:18:41'] I am going to go all in on Apple. They will come out with something big once again and they have too many followers for them to ever go under. Even babies want Apple products.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 11:45:42'] I don't like AAPL as a brand or their products, but I'd never bad mouth the value they bring as an investment historically. Like some other commenters have already pointed out though the company has grown to a size where its fair to question whether or not they can continue substantial growth.The brand is practically a cult following, and I think they have a huge edge that someone who is a fan of the company isn't just going to have an iphone but probably a tablet, macbook, and all kinds of apple accessory nonsense. I dont think there's anything wrong with going long AAPL as a long term investment at this price point, but I'd personally prefer to park my money in a company that has more risk and upside for significant growth over a period of the next several years
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 10:16:50'] Apple stock is good, but $GME is better
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 09:46:09'] You can always sell cash covered puts at a price that seems reasonable to yourself, worst case you dont get the shares but make some money off the premium
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-18 16:11:44'] No. AAPL growth is slowing and its overvalued.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 14:29:15'] Microsoft is more of a safe play. Of all the companies in the world, i can't imagine a scenario that Microsoft fails. Great diversification, great cash flows and consistent growth.Apple has more potential upside imo. Their main cash cow has been their phone division and anything that comes with that (accessories, apps etc). They can expand a lot more. However, if for whatever reason their phone division goes south 10 years from mie, they will be in much worse place.Another good and safe play is Samsung. They are even more diversified than Microsoft, probably the most safe a hardware company can be
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 23:05:17'] Lol...I bought $MSFT in 2016 when they traded at $56 I remember reading some "experts" who said that Micrsft missed the mobile phone market and how consumers were turning from PC to mobile/tablets....and now Microsoft is a growth stock lol....point I would not count out companies that sit on billions in cash they can afford huge R&D depts and buy up start up competitors. AAPL M1 chip and their dedication to top down system optimization would make them interesting in the EV space

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 13:14:08'] The way I look at this is AAPL owns retail, Microsoft owns business. Without Microsoft business would literally screech to a halt. Now more than ever. This is why I own both.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 10:14:29'] Microsoft lost a lot of developer mindshare in the 2010s.Meaning that the people who write software have long ago switched from the Microsoft platform, developer tools and stacks.Most modern software development (at scale) is being done with Java and Javascript.  AWS is pretty dominant in cloud hosting.  A lot of micro services architectures leveraging Docker and open source stacks running on linux.A lot of the workstations used by developers are latest and greatest Apple MacBook Pro machines.This is just my “man on the ground” perspective.I’m sure Microsoft has a lot of “cash cow” products that they continue to charge for but I don’t really see it as a “growth” company that can innovate.  Once developers have switched their workstation platforms and have gone full open source as far as the platform they deploy their software to, you’ve lost innovation and control of the future.  Like it or not, Microsoft Windows is not going to be the operating system that powers cloud platforms of the future.  It’s not really about Apple versus Microsoft. It’s about open-source versus licensed platforms and developer mindshare.  Through extremely disingenuous business practices, Microsoft has managed to alienate a huge share of the developer population. They will never use Microsoft platforms or tools again.  They treat any mention of Microsoft tools, stacks or platforms with suspicion.  They know that with Microsoft there is always a catch. A huge problem that Microsoft has is that of licensing software at scale.  You need to license every running instance of Microsoft software.  This makes it impossible to scale up because every computing unit that you add you have to pay a license for to Microsoft.  Modern software has to scale up and out.  This just becomes impossible from a licensing perspective with Microsoft. It’s much better to go with a free open source stack.Microsoft has licensing terms built into their developer tools that can rob you blind.  They also force you to keep using their platform by locking you into their ecosystem from the time you have a MVP. (Minimum Viable Product)  This is built-in to the software lifecycle when you use Microsoft development tools.  Microsoft also creates artificial problems and gaps for which you need to buy another Microsoft product.  They do this purposely in order to get more of your money.  It is though they have perfected the art of capturing your money.  The more needs you have and the more problems you need to solve, the more money you have to pay Microsoft.This has driven many developers over a tipping point where they never want to have anything to do with any Microsoft product or platform in the future.  Ever again.That’s a terrible reputation to have as a business with your core audience.  Ultimately a successful software business (SaaS, platform, tools) is built on developer mind share.  Ensuring that developers use your offerings to build new software. That is not happening with Microsoft. There is a lot of old software that was built using Microsoft tools but nothing new.I’d say long-term bet against Microsoft.  Bet on amazon AWS.  Bet on Atlassian.  Bet on IntelliJ.  Bet on Mirantis / Docker.  Bet on companies offering IaaS to open source software scalable stacks and software architectures.  Like amazon AWS.  Don’t bet on companies whose whole business model is capturing licensing revenue from every part of the software lifecycle.  Don’t bet on Oracle or Microsoft.  They are thinking about software in terms of nickel and diming you for every little thing.  License costs for every component of your architecture.Developers are moving to a free open source model where the software they write will run on architectures that are made up of open source software components.  This way, it might cost money to develop (the tools cost money, your Apple laptop costs money) but to run the end product you won’t need to pay any licensing cost.  You will still pay for IaaS costs, but nothing else to run the software that you write.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 17:50:45'] I won't change because I agree with you. Apple only relies on stagnating sales of iPhone. They've got tons of cash but don't know what to do with it
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 11:12:34'] I hold Apple. No Microsoft. Microsoft has only ever bought and suffocated the technology into pure crap. They may have a stranglehold right now, but the next gen of devs aren’t going to deal with their shit. Apple products are expensive, but a lot of the software is free and generally, it’s decently written and just works. VMware, azure, and others like this won’t be around forever. I’d choose VMware over azure, but I’d also choose neither of them other other more open platforms, that I can actually own and take control of. As for the office tools. Those will die out as soon as the next gen of IT takes over the dinosaurs in place currently who were taught it’s a Microsoft world only. Open source licensing is the future despite what both Microsoft and apple would have you believe.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 16:15:01'] Microsoft buys innovation. But frankly from an in house innovation perspective besides maybe azure they pale in comparison to apple. As a company it has a more mature workforce and ppl consider it to be a good job to rest and vest. The Microsoft brand is also iconic but not exactly alluring. Apple has vertically integrated products. They have much a better brand. They haven't been buying as many companies as microsoft but are sitting on A LOT of cash. Every product they seem to release either becomes a sensation, an eventual revenue source or ppl forget that it failed. From an engineering perspective the company is a lot more focused on innovation, internal R&D, has more 'innovative' teams and is the go to destination for engineers in the hardware space compared to microsoft. From a business perspective their future products will all probably have some sort of subscription model which is great cash flow and people love the brand enough to get into it , see Apple Card.This was purely me saying stories tho. Msft seems to be a better buy right now marginally but apples brand is too strong to count it out.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 19:36:48'] 40 years is a long time.   Either stock should be fine, but I would lean toward MSFT. Having said that, 40 Years is a long time. Both of those stocks are huge and have much less growth potential than smaller stocks. For that time-line, I would recommend something else with more growth potential.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 14:26:30'] Microsoft has a wider market.Apple has the stronger brand and products.Think Coke v Pepsi. Sure Pepsi has more sodas, frito lay and a bunch of other snack foods under the sun, usually salty ones that make you thirsty. But Cokes brand is so powerful they dont need to diversify as far to be competitive, their branding changed the color of Santa Claus's coat in the public mind from green to red.Apple has their technology products (hardware) that average a 2 year turn over rate before buying a new one. Short of the surface line of computers theres not too many real examples of physical hardware from Microsoft that people would purchase like that

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-11 15:12:56'] The majority of it is due to PE expansion. As interest rates continue to fall, chasing yields means PE ratios tend to rise.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-11 15:13:49'] Apple was severely undervalued when it was at a sub 14 PE. It has annual revenues coming in larger then most large cap companies entire market value. People finally woke up the fact that the company basically prints money and is arguably the most shareholder friendly company to ever exist. They buy back 10’s of billions of dollars of stock every year and pay a fast growing dividend on top of that and have one of the stickiest ecosystems and moat. People will say they lost their touch and can’t innovate anymore but I strongly disagree. Airpods alone are worth ~100b if they were their own company. Apple Watch is incredibly useful and is becoming more health related with its capabilities....I mean that thing can tell when your dehydrated, blood pressure...pretty soon it will be able to tell you if your blood sugar is low for those people who are diabetic (It has an app but you need another separate device it links too afaik). Their services are growing very fast, AppleTV has been pretty successful on its own as well. They adapt to changing landscapes and overcome by simply doing things more efficiently and better imo. They’re now making their own ARM chips for macs and getting away from Intel which I think will increase their margins. They may not making something new and fantastic every single year or even every two years...they take their time and do things right. So once in a while they have a huge hit (Airpods, Watch) that just owns the market and makes shit tons of money. They play the long game and run their company as such. Time of the friend of a wonderful business and the enemy of a mediocre one. Who knows what they will bring to the market in the next decade but I can almost guarantee it will be a hit and I want to be a part of that. Disclosure I hold Apple as 31% of my portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-11 15:25:47'] It may be overvalued. However, market conditions and company performance and fundamentals all play a role in this valuation.Over this past year they’ve seen continued success in their hardware, captured iPhone market share in Asia (which has been a challenge), and have shown growth in their services. Going forward, iPhone sales may be stagnant but their wearables are still growing. Services will continue to grow. They will improve margins and performance on computers by switching to their in house chips. They will likely continue to perform well in emerging markets, and they probably have a plans for the company that have not yet been disclosed to the public. All of this alone, may not justify their additional 1T in one year however we are in very strange and uncertain time in the market. Any headline can cause stocks to soar or tank. Investors want stability and steady growth so they look toward ETFs, certain value stocks, and FAANG. This inflates Apples valuation even more. Even compared to the rest of the FAANG they have the least exposure to risk. I mean they Have cash reserves greater than Netflix’s entire Market Cap.Also the hype from the split has attracted a lot of retail investors, but I imagine that has minimal effect on their valuation. I personally think they are overvalued right now, but I will always hold APPL and add little more whenever there is a slight dip

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 05:07:30'] They generated 260 billion in revenue in 2019, which if you are to take a 2 Trillion market cap, is about 7.5 multiple, which is high, but you can see similar p/s in similar companies. I think to really question that is to question tech as a whole. Which, could be fair, but doesn't speak specifically to AAPL.They killed earnings during this pandemic and if there is another stimulus, I expect them to see another bump. Growth has been phenomenal. Cash on hand is ridiculous. Buybacks. A significant portion of sales is international. It could be seen that they have a great path forward in terms of security and services. You could argue they are overvalued. I think it could also be argued that it is a great place to put money right now and possibly one of a few safe havens for anybody interested in finding growth.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 11:00:04'] PE expansion is the macro reason culprit, but it's not APPL specific, it's across industries. **TLDR** For APPL specifically, the answer comes down to growth and potential of *services.*AAPL's iPhone sales are shrinking (or at best, de-celerating). AAPL's key to growth is services, which is largely the app store (which is also the center of monopoly accusations). Services is rapidly growing and APPL takes a ~30% cut of any sales through the app store, including when customers subscribe to other services, be it Spotify, New York Times, Headspace, etc. This 30% is essentially pure-margin--AAPL doesn't have many costs associated here and it's essentially acting as a gatekeeper to iPhone users and taking a big cut of revenue from other companies. This, in my opinion, warrants an increased price to earnings ratio as this is a super high margin part of the business that has huge growth and potential.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 12:37:11'] You are looking for a logical reason for an illogical market. This is the worst way to trade. You'll end up justifying prices that are to high or to low by looking for conformational evidence.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 15:55:35'] The US dollar is effectively worthless with all this borrowing, keeping your money in a hard asset like stock is accelerating valuations.  The stock market realized this and is basically buying whatever stock they think will be around in 10-25 years.  Those that the market thinks will be around have surged, those they think won’t are dying, think Ford, GE others.  This era will mark a sea change in valuations for ever.

Apple music overtook spotify as #1 music service in US. Services business is much higher margin than hardware and doesn't suffer from hardware upgrade cycle effects.Alongside, new hardware like Airpods, ipad mini etc. are dominating their categories. Again these are lower priced products so can be upgraded more frequently by the customers than a $1k+ phone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 15:51:37']  So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.How to use it?1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore themThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 13:33:54'] I started buying at $141, then again at $136, then again at $134, then again at $121, then again at $117. My cost basis is now $129.70. I personally think AAPL will be back in the $140’s before too much longer. Seems like a safe stock to hold long term. Look at the 1-year and 5-year charts for it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 13:27:58'] Depends on your amount of capital and individual risk tolerance. Different for everyone. Apple will continue to increase year over year. Can never have too many shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 21:49:22'] 1. As long as AAPL keeps innovating, and maintaining Brand Identity as the premium technology and personal carry hardware company, you shouldn't stop buying AAPL. 2. Don't try to time the market.3. Do not hope that a stock price falls so you can buy it cheap. If it falls you don't know that it's gonna rebound. Hope stock prices go up. That's the problem you want.4. If you're waiting for APPL to drop - it's dropped. AAPL is on sale: 15% off all AAPL shares is a pretty good deal. So ignore number one and consider this a good time to buy more AAPL. 5. Don't take my word for it: Duetche Bank target = $160, CitiGroup = $150, Morgan Stanley = $164, Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha, InvestorPlace and a bunch of other premium services call it a strong buy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 19:07:08'] I don't agree with the thought Apple will always go up. Don't get me wrong, Apple is a great company with solid financials. But, that alone is not enough to say it will always go up. That being said, there are far worse things to buy than Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 18:58:18'] It's not just "how much is it valued at" but "compared to what?"When you look at any individual stock, you should look at the position that stock has in the overall market (as as a retailer such as AAPL compared to Samsung).  * How is the market position?* What is the strength of the currency by which you'll be buying the stock?* How does the overall market look?It's a comparison, what your dollar can buy you versus the number of shares that AAPL you can acquire.  Look at your other stocks, and compare them that way - by ratios.  Look at the AAPL stock and compare it to the overall market.  Those give you two barometers that are price independent.  1 AAPL or 1 WMT?  Now what if it were 10 AAPL for 1 WMT?  1 AAPL or 1 VTI?  Again, what if it were 10 VTI for one share of AAPL?Berkshire looks expensive now, but since there hasn't been a split ... same can be said about TSLA, but there has been a split (and it's still over $600/sh)My AAPL position this past year is up to a bit over $50K, with an average buy-in price of $68.  I use WMT above) because my buy-in price there was $113, so two of WMT for one of AAPL back in 2020?  I'm going to sell WMT, but not buy AAPL at this time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 20:18:22'] Honestly, if you're a new investor; I'd keep putting at least 50% of your portfolio/weekly funds into it until you can prove that you can beat it consistently with other picks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 14:24:03'] Please read books with valuation metrics. So many young, naive investors are going to get burned in the long run. It's honestly hard to watch.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 14:19:39'] If you are investing long term then it is safe to buy Apple at any level as long are you are consistently dollar cost averaging on very strict time intervals ($200 a month, or $100 every two weeks, etc.), just keep an extra 10-20% of your total portfolio off to the side in CASH. Then when you get a big downturn you have the capital to buy those dips. Just remember to never sell.Short term investing or even perhaps momentum investing those are entirely different strategies. That is where doing your research comes into play and what value you think Apple stock should be compared to where it current is. And in that case you would probably want to do Options. That way you can look at different news and try to forecast what you think is coming and then try to hedge your bets with different strategies, because IMO Options are pure gambling.You can also try to use the volatility as a gauge. It is like the calm before the storm. Low volatility generally means the price is too high and others are thinking the same thing. You can probably grab better deals during periods of high volatility. There will always be some news that breaks that you didn’t uncover during your research.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 20:54:56'] Look at AAPL's historic P/E ratio and compare it to it's current P/E ratio. Arguably, it's overpriced right now, but so is everything else. You got in at a good price but personally, I'm waiting for it to hit $100 or less before buying in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-17 12:52:04'] the thing is, it might not drop below where it is.just because drops are inevitable doesn't mean that future drops won't come after a run up. if the price runs up to $175/share, maybe it has a "huge drop" that brings it down to $145/share. look at TSLA for an example of this. it just had a MASSIVE drop a week ago, but it didn't bring it anywhere near what we could buy it for 6 months or so ago.ideally what you want to be doing is making projections of what the value will be a year or two from now, and as long as it's under that price, just get a little bit whenever you can.that being said, ideally you'd have some kind of a percentage limit in mind of how much of you're portfolio you're willing to dedicate to one company. i personally try to avoid letting one company represent more than 20% of my portfolio. (sure, it happens some times, so this isn't a set in stone hard rule).

At 34.82 a share, you'll collect an annual dividend of 7.47%. Reading in to some recent Form 4's filed by 10 executives, new pricing, exc. VZ's cash flow will not only stay consistent but growing. I think VZ is a great play, esp the lower the cost goes now that people believe DISH and AMZN can compete against VZ.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 13:46:37'] During a market downturn, many investors look for opportunities to buy stocks at a discounted price. Some investors may look for companies that have a strong financial position and a history of steady growth, but whose stock price has been affected by the downturn. Other investors may look for companies that are undervalued based on their fundamental metrics, such as their price-to-earnings ratio or their dividend yield. Ultimately, the specific stocks you may consider will depend on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and overall investment strategy. It's important to conduct your own research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.

POST_TEXT: b'Anybody have an opinion on Disney and AAPL at the moment. I just cant help but think these two stocks are an absolute steal. Ive just started investing in the last year and bought 10 shares of apple and two of Disney so far. Im fairly optimistic that Disney could be in the $300-400 area in a couple of years. No DD there thats just optimism on Disney+ and parks and cruises being bag at 100% capacity eventually. Apple is apple and although Ive lost money on it so far I cant help but think itll recover and be huge again as well. Im a long term holder on almost everything I buy. I know my holdings are very minimal but wanting to grow the right way and everybody has to start somewhere.'
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 10:52:27'] AAPL - yesDisney - I think it’s a bit hot. But long term I think you’ll be good investing in the Mouse. Your 3-400 range would put Disney at a market cap of 500-750 billion. That’s a big jump from their current 260 billion.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 14:00:55'] Disney is one of my biggest holdings. It's an absolute monopoly on the entertainment industry. Remember they bought out 21st century Fox and [40% of all movie revenue in 2019 went to Disney.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/29/disney-accounted-for-nearly-40percent-of-the-2019-us-box-office-data-shows.html#:~:text=Disney%2Dproduced%20films%20account%20for,represents%2038%25%20of%20the%20market.) Disney+ is in it's infant stage, and of every competing streaming service, I believe Disney has the IP's and content to compete with Netflix. Right now the movie industry is in a downturn because of COVID, but that just means now's the time to BUY AND HOLD. I truly believe the sky's the limit here.

Do you think AAPL is worth more than Barclays, Lloyds, BP, AZN,GKS? It depends on your investment strategy but look for the next Disney. The easy money is off the table at this point. I would point to emerging markets as many  "investors" are light in that area.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 10:57:31'] AAPL has room to run but DIS (up $5+ today and +$20 for the month) is too hot to handle right now. In fact I plan on dumping DIS at $150 and then buying on the dip.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 14:40:44'] I think there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding Disney's future. Movie theaters may not fully rebound. This means the big blockbuster investments Disney made in Star Wars and Marvel may not be as lucrative as they once projected.Moreover Disney has not handled the Star Wars IP particularly well. The last movie was terrible (and I say that as a pretty lenient Star Wars fan who enjoyed Force Awakens). People are excited about Disney+, but Disney is competing in an ever expanding range of entertainment choices for kids. Kids today have anime, video games, Twitch, Youtube videos, etc to entertain them. Studios from Netflix and Amazon are going to continue to knock out decent hits.I'm not saying Disney is going to be a loser. But to me they certainly don't seem as attractive as they once were.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 14:43:52'] I had appl and sold it, since then I was able to turn 3000k into 12000k. I don’t know why appl isn’t moving but I learned not to sit on a stock and wait for it to go. What I think is going to happen is appl will move very slowly over the next year. It’s about the 5g not the device. Unless appl comes out with something stellar like a new thing we didn’t know we needed they are not going to be a fast moving stock. They are going to be more like a safe bet. Not gonna gain much not gonna loose much. Now currently the movement is all about EV and EV related. Disney and appl went after entertainment. Until we get back to huge Hollywood movies and free movement around the country they won’t do much. The EV market is big risk big reward. I would be cautious after January for any stock until the new president is in place. It’s just the safe play.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 15:00:53'] Overly optimistic on streaming.. it's not an easy business and requires tons of $$$$$$ to be spent on content. Disnrys+ numbers look good because their signing up discounted+ free accounts, emerging markets they are charging less than USA..
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 16:02:08'] I sure hope so. I bought a few shares of AAPL right before the Share redistribution and I haven't seen it in the green yet overall.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 16:18:52'] So your thesis is that the worlds most valuable company (apple) which has nearly doubled in value over the past year (without doubling their earnings) is set to go up soon? Doubt it. Companies actually grow slower when they get bigger. Apple is a great company and will continue to gobble up tons of monies but I’m confident you’ll have to wait a long time to see that principal double.  Disney... I wouldn’t touch with a ten foot pole. They have ass tons of debt, and are valued nearly at the same spot they were this time last year right when Disney plus came out??? Pre pandemic?? During the end of the longest bull market in history?? Thats actually looney.  Both are 2x overvalued as far as I’m concerned. And seeing that apples past 3 months they are -10% I’d say the market agrees with me right now.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 16:33:14'] Disney is up 33% over the past 20ish months. That’s big growth for a company of their size, and it was done while losing untold billions throughout the pandemic. Why exactly does everyone here seem to think it’s a steal?AAPL is up 150% over the same period. I think there are far too many novices in the market right now that have only known stocks to go up up up up over their entire investing tenure, which has been all of 8 months.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 11:33:08'] AAPL went sideways after the split - they have had some judgements against them regarding them slowing down iPhones, and now there is news of pushback at child labor laws in China that might hurt them. they are at support, but may find a new floor if one more piece of bad news hits them.  I'm tempted in improving that position but I might sit back and watch the trends to see where it goes.Disney, I haven't looked at in a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 12:41:17'] Personally I think most of apples growth is behind them, but Disney is solid

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 10:23:17'] Interesting article on hacker news, apparently the staff at Meta dont use their VR headsets much either. I cant use VR at all because I get vertigo and know many other do. migraines too. so I thought Metaverse was doomed to fail from the get go. Anyway...Google have Deep mind, and have been in the game with powerful AI for a while, what trumped them is public access. ChatGPT was a master stroke in that regard and blew the lid off companies hording "their precious".I am in TQQQ on this, the reason is that AI big bois are propping up the markets but any one of them could take a tumble on a proper game-changing moment from leftfield. Ultimately it's the big names that will own AI, or buy it out, all else will be open source catching up. So open source is the place to look. but...Though its a bit like crapto post 2013, where it was almost impossible to pick winners, but if you threw enough at a bundle, one might moonshot. Its happening fast now , but the difference this time is the AI companies stock is not 0.001 cent, but already at >$200, so no one is jumping in.NVDA should have been predictable obvious one, and I am still seeing lots of investors poo-pooing it saying dont get in now , too expensive. But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. Same with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. my view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.meantime the biggest market yet to be breached imo is home robots. M3gan is the most insightful movie on this. Its way off though, the hype is not the truth with home robots yet. but AI first.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:58:24'] This is why AMD bought Xilinx.  Xilinx is the leader in FPGAs.And $35,000 for a single Nvidia H100 GPU creates alot of incentive for data scientists & corporations to find cheaper alternatives, whether it's through training method or hardware (Founder of ChatGPT says large language models are already being phased out for smaller models that cost factors less).  AI is still in very early stages.  The costs will come down dramatically to the detriment of Nvidia.  In 2007, it cost $10 Million to sequence a human genome; today it costs $200.  For AI to be ubiquitous, the costs have to, and will come down.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-25 05:04:32'] So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.How to use it?1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore themThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-24 22:07:44'] Support and resistance at different levels, right now it is at $120/- and the market could push it down to $110 or lower.Analyst expects a 3 trillion company by next year (source: https://financialpost.com/investing/already-the-most-valuable-stock-in-the-world-apples-market-cap-could-reach-3-trillion-analysts-say), can't time the market but best to get feet wet first and buy more when it dips further.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-06 15:48:18'] Hold, never sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-07 02:32:27'] The answer is yes.  AAPL is a long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-06 16:15:32'] You own apple, you don't trade it
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-06 21:22:54'] Since apple seems to do so well and be such a safe bet (along with MSFT, amzn, google, disney, nintendo) is there a reason not to take my 401k and put it into these instead? It seems like the money would grow faster in the stock market. Am I missing something that prevents most ppl from doing this?? I get 401k compounds interest, but still don't think it comes close to % growth in a year
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-06 13:26:58'] Bought Apple in 2012, sadly I only have 1100 shares left, don't fucking sell it until it doubles, then don't sell more than half.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 09:44:21'] It’s 45% of my portfolio. Wouldn’t be comfortable with that high of a percentage in any other individual stock but Apple is consistently growing, finding new markets & expanding their share of existing markets. I’m comfortable not looking at that position for a decade or 2 so I’m holding.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-06 18:53:08'] I sold puts on AAPL last year and got assigned in November. It had ran up 100% already then. I have been selling calls against the shares since then. My shares are up 30% since November even after the huge run up. AAPL is hard to beat.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 08:00:42'] Inflation is getting entrenched.  As Dimon said, Fed is losing control.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 10:39:31'] I still feel the biggest hurdle in taming inflation is the housing market. The surge in the amount of wealth created in home equity in such a short amount of years and people locked into ultra low mortgages is really staggering. We have been looking to upgrade and move to a new area but don't want to pay much more for less space. There is no reason our current home went up 40% in 2 years and similar homes are still selling in under a week with the higher rates.  Dual physician household with young babies and don't feel comfortable buying $2+ million 3000 ft tract homes in OC and having the higher property taxes etc. Makes more sense to upgrade our current home and pay for private school. It's hard out there for first time home buyers and current owners wanting to move and the issue won't be fixed anytime soon.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 05:48:03'] Thoughts on what’s the end point of all this? Evidently people still aren’t getting laid off no matter how much and how fast Fed raises rates. Obviously a strong labor market is a good thing for Americans and America. But maybe this means Fed is just gonna keep raising to 6%, 7%, 8%, 10% etc, until *someday* something breaks. In the meantime we just bleed.Tbh some part of me feels disgusted at hoping for layoffs to start just so we finally have a sign that the recession people have constantly talked about for the past year is finally here, and we can move on and hopefully a new growth cycle starts in the next year or so, and I can stop losing money. Maybe I’m just not cut out for the stock market and should just stay out of it

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 07:33:12'] I'll be optimistic and suggest that this is a pretty severe overreaction. This month's reading is slightly higher than last month, but the overall trend is still clearly downwards. In fact, if you disregard last month's number, which everyone agreed was fantastically low, today's PCE YoY number is still the lowest YoY we've had in the past 16 months (tied with July).    [https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\_core\_pce\_price\_index\_yoy#:\~:text=US%20Core%20PCE%20Price%20Index%20YoY%20is%20at%204.71%25%2C%20compared,long%20term%20average%20of%203.23%25](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_core_pce_price_index_yoy#:~:text=US%20Core%20PCE%20Price%20Index%20YoY%20is%20at%204.71%25%2C%20compared,long%20term%20average%20of%203.23%25).Of course it would be nice if today's number was lower. But it's not exactly a high number, especially when you view it in the context of the last 1.5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 09:02:13'] we are in a slow grind for the next 5 years imo.  Super low interest is not likely to come back.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 09:13:39'] u/MrRiklemanI disagree that TINA is dead.People are piling into stocks still because they believe that nominally stocks will outperform cash and debt.If Fed is targeting higher inflation than 2% as many influential economists predict, then 5Y or longer real yields are still extremely low and stocks are better nominally.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 06:57:01'] $SQ has me so confused. I bought in at $80 a bit ago thinking if good new came from the earnings call we might see the upper end of the price targets. I can’t tell if the numbers that came out are good news? Seems like people got pretty excited yesterday. I told myself I would cash out if it came back to $80 and tuck that cash someplace else but now I’m wondering if I should stick it out a bit. Pretty new to investing. I get the numbers but am I wrong is $SQ confusing RN. Should I hang tight? If you think so why, what do you see?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 02:43:10'] Hello everyone, I have a trading account that I started back NOV 2020 that some of my friends and family said they wanted me to trade their money.  It’s not big and they are all lifetime friends (about 5k for 2x people and 1k x 2, 12k total start) Well I’m doing quite well and mostly sell premium in slow movers aiming for 10%apr.  anyway, one wants to double their initial investment.Im trying to figure out a way to easily caluculate their share without having to basically “cash out” the account on paper each time one makes a contribution, but obviously I can’t just add 5k to the initial starting value of the account.  I was trying to figure out how to come up with a share/dividend system but I’m not sure if I’m thinking about it right.  I’m thinking to make every share worth $100 and each time someone makes a contribution, it I “pay a dividend” which is immediately reinvested.  I’m betting someone will say something about taxes, well I’ve told them I’ll be charging the taxes when they withdraw the money and im personally keeping track of the amount each year in a spreadsheet.  But the tax rate is pretty close within a percentage point since my income is in the 50k range.  Am I overthinking or do I just need to reset the total numbers anytime there is a contribution to the pot?Edit:  calm down guys.  This is play money for them.  They are doctors and veterinarians.  This is play money for them.  They lose this amount in a single Vegas trips from time to time.  This isn’t life changing money for them.  If I told them “I need 5k to fix my car,” I’d have it in my bank account by end of day.  This is more of another excitement play for them and they get a laugh at it.

POST_TEXT: b'From Bloomberg:\n\n#### Apple Tells Suppliers iPhone Demand Has Slowed as Holidays Near \n\n*Apple Inc. (AAPL), suffering from a global supply crunch, is now confronting a different problem: slowing demand. The company has told its component suppliers\nthat demand for the iPhone 13 lineup has weakened, people familiar with the matter said, signaling that some consumers have decided against trying to get the hard-to-\nfind item, Bloomberg News reports.\nAlready, Apple had cut its iPhone 13 production goal for this year by as many as 10 million units, down from a target of 90 million, because of a lack of parts, Bloomberg News reported. But the hope was to make up much of that shortfall next year, when supply is expected to improve. The company is now informing its vendors that those orders may not materialize, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.*\n\nLooks like Christmas is cancelled, folks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 01:19:49'] Ballsy. Starting to see some spicey calls out of Goldman lately, getting up there with BoA. Just copy-pasting the article below since I was curious (analyst’s view, not mine)………….In his sell rating on Apple shares late Thursday, arguing that the current iPhone upgrade cycle looks more like a typical redesign cycle rather than the “supercycle” some were hoping for. Hall has been bearish on Apple’s stock since April 2020.“As a result we continue to expect iPhone replacement rates to resume their ongoing decline in 2021,” he wrote, helping drive his below-consensus forecasts for the full year and particularly the second half of the year. “In addition, our negative thesis on Apple is based on [average selling prices] remaining roughly unchanged in 2021 as consumers shift toward lower priced iPhones and this seems to be beginning to play out in supply chain orders.”The analyst is worried that Apple is cutting production orders, while customers are beginning to prefer lower-priced iPhones compared to their more expensive counterparts. On the shorter term, however, Hall does believe that Apple will report a strong holiday quarter given “solid consumer demand.”And while the COVID-19 pandemic has limited people’s ability to spend on things like travel and eating out, potentially leaving them with more spending money for electronics like Apple products, the analyst believes that a shift to out-of-home spending as the economy starts to reopen could be a “negative catalyst” for the Cupertino company’s shares.“We believe the shift of consumer disposable income toward vacations, restaurants, and other outside of the home spending as re-opening occurs is likely to act as a negative catalyst for Apple’s stock just as COVID lockdowns represented a tailwind,” writes the analyst.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 03:54:41'] Analysts and other commentators have no special insight into what's going on. Analysts have a spreadsheet that was created for them in the 70's, and all they do is change the variables in them and report the number that it spits out. If you're going to an analyst to get deeper insight into a stock, you've gone to the wrong place.Another thing to note is that commentators and headlines just report on some arbitrary metric and then they create a headline around that. "Insiders are buying - it's a sign!" Yes, insider buying can sometimes be a sign, and it's actually one I use myself when I do research, but it's stupid to make that a headline because anyone who's interested in the stock has most likely already looked into insider buying. Another one is "This CEO's compensation is elevated compared to earnings, an annual meeting might bring that up!" - No, the annual meeting won't bring it up. It's just one metric a headline picked out because they can put an exclamation point after it. If you're motivated to buy a stock because of a headline by a commentator or, god help you, Motley Fool, then you need to take a breather. Their job isn't to sell the stock, it's to sell the headline. Same goes for analysts - their job isn't to sell the stock, it's to sell the analysis.Bearish and bullish analysts make the headlines because people click on bears and bulls. There's only one actor you can trust in the markets, and that's you. No one else in the markets is looking out for your best interests.

Usually they beat guidance/consensus estimates, but for Q3 they did not.Supply chain issues are impacting iPhone sales, while FAANG peers are largely unaffected.The stock has had a good run compared to FAANG peers. If you take a 3 year view, it has performed as well as any FAANG stock. It is sitting at a similar P/E ratio to FB and GOOGL, yet expected earnings and revenue growth are significantly lower than those companies (which is expected, as they're predominantly software and easier to scale). Therefore it's healthy for the APPL stock to slow down for a while.If you'd like to feel good about the APPL stock performance, just look at AMZN and FB which have fared worse, placing APPL in the mid-range for FAANG performance. The APPL stock performance has beat the NASDAQ 100 on the 3 year view, and year-on-year, is only a little under the NASDAQ 100, which is good for a company of its size.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 09:11:16'] Well have you ever considered the fact that 85-95% of their products are made and developed by companies like Microsoft and Samsung? Even the cameras on their phones. Their processors aswell. The only thing unique about Apple products are the inferior Mac OS and their IoS. They're stagnating on the stock market because their entire business plan is "This is an APPLE product, it's worth 1000$."  Even the new cars they're building are using AMD products... They're just... Reinventing the wheel, and normally worse than their competitors. And they're losing at that because of their shady business tactics, the way they treat customers, and well, the insides of their products. This isn't advice from a stock standpoint, but, just the knowledge of a computer/technology fanboy. Like seriously the last "innovation" apple has had in their phones was "ooh a shiny Samsung camera!" And "emojis that mimic your face!" I'm impressed that the just overall name "apple" is what keeps them afloat...

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 19:54:54'] I think buying those companies is like having a money printer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 00:59:10'] I will be happy with MSFT returning 12% annual for the next 5 years minimally
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 00:57:13'] These four have plenty of growth left. Anything in the cloud space still has a long, long ways to go. You may not see 40-60% yoy numbers but these companies also have incredible margins on portions of their businesses. Unregulated monopolies are some of the best businesses in the world.I actually think in a pullback these will fare better than a lot of people think. I sold a lot of my value stocks (LMT, VZ, BTI, MRK, etc) and feel much better sitting in Amazon and Microsoft.I think TSM is a great business and is a juggernaut right now. One option is you just buy a small bucket of stocks and don’t look at this as either-or. The two industries I know very well are cloud tech and semiconductors and I own more of Amazon than anything else followed by Microsoft. Or, you can just buy a low fee index fund (VT) and not touch it for 30-40 years and I have a feeling you’ll do pretty well.

Btw, if I had to only pick 3 that I think would provide the greatest returns over the next 10 years: probably SQ (if you can get it closer to 210), SE (under 230) and NET.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:34:00'] Honestly you nailed the four companies that everyone should own.   I know it is very difficult to believe but honestly it is still early.  These companies still have tons and tons of runway to work with.   They have incredibly valuable assets that have yet to be monetized.For growth I see Amazon and Google continuing to have the strongest growth going forward.  But Apple and Microsoft will also continue to enjoy strong growth but see it more easily for Apple.You are also going to see these four competing against one another more and more.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 00:10:07'] All of these mega tech companies are near-monopolies in their primary products and those products have a very high technical entry barrier.   And combine that with the amount of cash they generate,  they probably can buy any other company apart from each other and a handful of other companies.   They can throw money, resources or buy their way into any new technology and snap up any company that remotely threatens their bread and butter products.   That said, it is hard to look apart from them in the tech sector in the longer term.  The only real reason to doubt them is Government intervention.  They all are too big for their own good now and there is a possibility of Govt regulation negatively impacting them.

And for the main sectors that they are involved in, I can't think of another company that I would rather invest in for those sectors.I think that Google will lag behind those other three over the long-term and I think there are other investments in the advertising sector that will have better growth than Google, so Google is the only one of these that I no longer invest in. I replaced them with Facebook and Pinterest for my plays in the advertising sector.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:39:49'] Why not both?  I own both.Edit:  I see you already have AAPL. If that’s the case and you are happy with your allocation, DIS it is.Still has a tech component of it with Disney+ but it has business lines AAPL does not have.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:47:46'] Apple. I’m going to go with the Best company in the world. They are #1 sales in: Phone, Tablet, watches, Headphone, App Store, Accessory for products, and with their dedicated computer chips are now the best selling laptops for the price. They’re getting into EV and it will further explode. Apple is always the answer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:39:15'] You'll be averaging up on AAPL? I like the idea of going non-tech since you're tech heavy but I feel DIS is expensive at the moment... although I do love the mouse and watch it every week with my daughter
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:41:19'] Half and half two strong companies
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 20:42:38'] ACTC at 28... :(I'd go for the AAPL at market open. You should be pretty close to 100 shares if not over it, which means you can sell covered calls for some extra income.DIS isn't a bad long term hold though and you may consider adding some later.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 22:04:52'] I mean. AAPL is at a $2.03 trillion market cap. If it were to double that would make it at $4.06 trillion. DIS is at $353 billion market cap. If it went up 300% it would be at a $1 trillion market cap. Imo, the question comes down to how high will Apple’s market cap go? People thought $1 trillion was impossible, then Apple did it, then $2 trillion was impossible, here we are. Will it soon hit $4 trillion?IMO both are expensive rn. Especially Disney. And this ain’t advice obvio.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 21:32:26'] I have owned Apple for a long time and am always happy to buy more. I owned Disney for over 10 years and had kept reinvesting until this winter. I know it’s at a great price right now, but I cashed out. I don’t see why Disney is valued where it is, and I don’t think now is a good time to buy into it. That’s my personal opinion, but since you asked, I’ve shared. If you want to stick with some pretty solid performance, get more Apple. If you’re looking for something in entertainment, look at SIX. It was at more than $60 before the COVID shutdowns and is dancing around the mid $40’s right now. I think there is room to grow there.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 22:04:39'] Buying the dip on Apple.  It’s coming back.  No brainer.  Mark this post, 3:1 split early 2022.  Post Covid buying spree is coming.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 05:11:37'] Por qué no los dos?!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 21:29:54'] I like both and own both. I have more Apple than Disney because it’s just been a strong horse for me over the years and the dividends is a nice bonus in recent years. I think Apple still has a solid growth story and it’ll continue to expand its subscription model. They might expand their product and services. Not sure what. You have Apple so I would add more to Disney to balance it out. I don’t think Disney will go back to dividends but those were nice and the only reason I held on to Disney at $85/share for so many years. It had done literally nothing until it added Disney plus. That recurring revenue stream is going to be a key business driver. I think the movie distribution industry is going to change a lot post COVID and Disney is poised to win here with their platform. Aside from movies, they have amazing content that they could spin off from just the marvel universe alone (eg Wanda Vision, etc). Parks will reopen eventually. P/E on these companies are high but who knows what investors are looking for anymore. Long term, I don’t think you can go wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 07:38:55'] Buy more of both

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 21:07:44'] Honestly neither, they’re both very overvalued from a historical perspective. If you absolutely had to pick one I would go with Apple. Cue someone to tell me why this time is different and something magical happened to Apple’s business in 2018 which made a mid-teens PE diverge to a mid-thirties. Similar with Disney.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-09 22:22:45'] You should’ve gotten Apple at 116 on Monday! There’s still time she could still head back this week before skyrocketing again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 09:04:08'] personally i'm more optimistic on apple right now than disney. disney is letting their politics interfere with business as they remove classic movies like dumbo and peter pan from their service (which in turn means it's probably only a matter of time until they black list the movies for bluray sales / park appearances / etc.). they're also removing people from high profile successful shows like carano on the mandalorian.at some point, if they continue going down that route it's going to bite them in the ass. nostalgia is a powerful thing and disney is opting to throw the things people are nostalgic about in the trash while kneecapping their new content.they're not going bankrupt or tanking any time soon, i just don't see room for massive growth above and beyond what they did this year. i picked up some shares this time last year, but don't have any plans to get more. aapl on the other hand while having the same politics isn't letting it interfere with their business. they'll continue to grow, and if anything comes from the "apple car", that stock is going to explode. (yes, i realize they probably won't "make" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)as far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 04:17:15'] I bought both
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 04:59:25'] Dis has exposure to several sectors all in one. Cruise line, resorts, theme parks, streaming, e-commerce, brick and mortar. It's bounced back from last year and has hit ATH all while running at partial capacity and shutting off dividends. Not saying it's a moon shot, but if you're already into AAPL, might as well pick up some DIS
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 18:02:33'] Little worried what happens to Apple stock at least in the short term if the Apple car goes the way of The Apple television that never materialized.

I’m too embarrassed to  even admit to them here.  But I also am holding some winners.  My hope is over time my winners and better picks will yield gains that will offset the losses.  I have a threshold point at which I will sell all most likely.  My goal was always just to capture a certain % increase over my principal for fun and then shove it into an index fund.  Disclaimer: I know nearly nothing about trading and do not claim to.  Hence my experimental portfolio.  Mostly I put my investment money in index funds and have a split between that and cash atm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 16:10:08'] Took a super quick look at those two.  It’s currently a challenging environment for unprofitable companies.  Probably will remain that way for awhile.   There are other companies that have taken it on the chin a lot more than these two.   I know that doesn’t help but you’re not down 70-90%.These situations sucks.   Sometimes it’s better to move on and sometimes it’s better to hold.  No one knows.   The only way to look at it is this:  Today would you buy the stock?  Is the story the same?  And if so what would your target price be?  You need to look at their financials, growth prospects, current market environment, and make a new decision.  If you’re down 40% you need them to go up 80% to break even.  Is that even possible?   Dunno I’ll use PTON as an example.  Personally I would bet 100-1 that it will never see +100 ever again.  Probably not 50.  Personally don’t think it will ever go over 20.   So if I bought it at 80 and had the above beliefs I would have to suck it up sell it and move on.   I would not buy the stock today so why would I hold the stock? Anyways GL but that’s the thought process of dumping a loser. It happens.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 15:04:00'] When you buy something you believe is undervalued you should consider selling it when it sells for a fair value or sell if it's overvalued.A -40% decrease should only mean you should try to find more money so you can buy more. Because when you bought it was already cheap so now it's super cheap.But it's easier said than done, I have also bought a stock that went down and I started to question the decision. And that's when you have made a mistake.And with new technology like CRISPR, it's cool stuff but it's hard to say which companies will dominate it and if they are selling at a good price.I prefer very easy stocks that I likely can explain everything to a very small child.

That's about the average length of a business cycle.If you need access to your money sooner than that, you should have that money in a more conservative place.

For example, one of my first stock picks fell 50% within a year of me buying it, but I held because I believed it would grow within the next two years. By the end of those two years, it was up 58% from my original cost. Stick to what you believe and don’t get discouraged, but be willing to change your mind when it makes sense rather than getting caught up on recent performance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 19:41:17'] So with the nature of capitalism, the strongest will survive, so the entire stock market will survive.  Therefore a total market index fund will likely survive and continue to grow over bear and bull cycles.That being said, many businesses fail or get bought out.  Many lose their former glory and never recover.  You're buying an ownership interest in a business.  If the business does not turn a profit or never lives up to it's promises, the stock market will correct the price quickly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 00:51:51'] Health warning, I’m not a professional, just a Redditor.I don’t think you should *always* but it depends on a few things.I see my cash as an asset that will grow and I will move it to the place I think it will grow the most. I have two categories. Long term growth and short term.Recently I sold two holdings in two companies that were perfectly fine stocks, but I had lost a bit on each, a legacy of the last eighteen months. I didn’t expect any short term growth in either. I used the money to buy stock in a company I just knew was temporarily undervalued and would grow quicker short term. I was right. My strategy is to let that growth continue to happen, likely sell, then re-evaluate where that money goes at that point. It may go back to the original stocks or something else. We will see.That money, at that time, was just more useful to me to take advantage of that specific opportunity. On the other hand I do have other money in stocks that are sitting, in some cases, with slight losses that I am content to hold for the moment, and likely long term. I anticipate those stocks are every bit as likely to grow as any others I could move the money to, and they anchor my portfolio in reliable stocks that I am confident in, and are unlikely to significantly crash. I think it’s important not to panic sell in most cases, but instead to constantly evaluate where your money is going to do the most work for you at that time. And on top of those judgements it’s important to have balance. I could conceivably have just moved ALL my money to that stock I mentioned above to reap short term rewards, but I’m also aware that my judgement is fallible, I don’t have all the facts, and events outside of my control could intervene and undermine my analysis of the short term viability of that stock. So my long term stock picks are my anchor to protect against volatility.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 01:56:52'] You should hold long term if you think the long term bet will make you more profit than multiple shorter term bets, opportunity cost and all. Personally I only have an advantage on long term predictions, because my short term bets are a crap shoot depending on the market's mood. So for me, I make more by holding stocks more than 3 years (and I been bagholiding CRSP for a while). And my reason is simple, I think I can predict technological progress better than the market, because the market is usually sus on new things and they give it too much risk.Now, when you're investing in health stocks in particular you should be aware that they live and die by the FDA trials. Especially companies with upcoming, not yet proven drugs, they'll slide downwards for years because trial progress is usually hidden. But the day the FDA publishes trial results, if it's positive the stock can jump by 5x. Or drop by 80% if negative trial outcome.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 03:02:20'] Patience is definitely the key, I started investing (gambling) in 2020 and since then have put in £60k. Through impatience, slowly but surely, I’ve whittled it down to 15k. I now look back at stocks which I sold because of fear and found I’d now be 2-300% up on them, god knows how many times this has happened. I cry myself to sleep thinking of the what ifs. I should probably give up but I feel now that I’m addicted (to disappointment that is). Ps I am finally finding patience and just waiting with the stocks I have and hopefully one day I’ll get my money back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 04:59:04'] There is no “right” answer, there will be approaches for your time horizon. Define for what time you are investing and that will start to narrow your options. Nobody can tell you the one hidden secret answer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 05:20:54'] That's the tricky part.  Figuring out which individual equities to purchase is hard enough, but pales in comparison to figuring out when to sell.  Nothing lasts forever, just check out the 30 year timelapse of the world's most valuable companies.  It's a constant leap frog boom bust cycle.  Surely apple, google, and microsoft are going to be around for a very long time, but are they really going to be the world's most valuable companies 10, 20, 30 years from now?  Who knows?  The point being, it makes a lot of sense to just buy ultra low costs indexes like voo/vti etc. unless you are an industry insider and investing is your full time job.

I'm always looking to hold for five years plus, but I will sell before if shit hits the fan.I'm not emotional about things...I hate selling at a loss, but it's better to sell at a 20% loss than a 70% loss as I "average down"
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 06:22:09'] First, what do you mean “to the end”? Second, here’s an idea. Pull out a blank sheet of paper and examine what you would do with that business right now. If you would buy it now then hold the stock. That’s what most people say, and it’s true. But the question you are probably wondering is: my stock is down 40% and it’s getting trashed, so what does everyone know that I don’t? I don’t have a good answer. Here are a few random thoughts:1. When Buffett talks about holding, it’s easier when he’s investing in Coke or whatever. Coke is almost always worth keeping and buying 40% lower. 2. A smaller stock is usually more volatile than the blue chips - if your stock is a small cap then the 40% dip might be fine. 3. The broader market drives a significant portion of your individual stock’s attention. Just because the whole market is moving in response to macro events doesn’t mean your individual stock is getting riskier - UNLESS macro climate uniquely impacts your stock. For example, do bank failures uniquely impact your stock?4. Be honest with yourself about your thesis. Are you just hoping? An example: if I’m buying Okta, do I really believe that here growth is going to continue at 40% y/y. Well, that’s a guess. If IRL that user growth is not happening then you can’t hope for it to happen.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 09:43:15'] I always sell any losing positions before the end of the year in which I bought them.  In taxable accounts, this creates a tax-asset that can be used to offset either current income or future realized capital gains. If you're an American, this figure will appear on Form 1040 Schedule D of your tax return.Usually, one sells the losing position and uses the money to purchase replacement shares in a similar but not identical investment. With ETFs or mutual funds this is a simple operation -- for instance, exchanging VTI for VOO or VV -- but with individual securities it's a little less straightforward. Since you mentioned wanting to start investing in index funds going forward, you could sell your position in CRSR and use the money to buy an index fund. The loss will then be realized, and will show up on the 1099-B your broker will send you at the beginning of the following year (again, assuming you're an American).  A 40% loss definitely hurts, but in your position I would consider selling, realizing the tax advantage, and moving to index funds as soon as possible. After all, a position that has [lost 40% of its capital will require a 67% gain just to break even](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Percentage_gain_and_loss), and all the while you risk losing even more of your capital by maintaining the position.There's no shame in taking a loss occasionally with your investments, particularly when you're young and don't have a family depending on you. Best of luck.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-29 15:20:08'] I base my trims on the quality or my perceived quality of a stock. Longterm stability, profits and all other metrics you naturally use.High risk 1-2% average up when gaining.Regular steady blue chips stocks 3-5%Growth but winning ie GOOG, CSU, types 5-8% I do believe in letting winners run.

Plus if you do FanLines on AAPL it’s broken and if it doesn’t get back above MA soon it’s next Fanline is $90. I personally am a longterm AAPL Bull but the shares I bought last year I’ve been selling and keeping my under $50 Shares. I think it will get momentum going again but June is historically the second worst month and it’s been a hell of a run. Nobody got hurt taking profits.

You cut down on apple to get more risk (for more reward, on more speculative plays), not the other way around. Apple is as safe as it gets. And for that reason it won’t get you a 10x.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-30 12:14:43'] I would take some profits and put them somewhere that will grow over the next few months. Maybe XLF. If apple dips sell the xlf shares and buy more apple. Financials look primed to keep growing in the short to medium term.

POST_TEXT: b"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity\n\nOver the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.\n\nThe reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\n\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\n\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:16:25'] The market cap is just so huge takes a lot to move now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 09:47:57'] The question around Apple is how can it maintain high growth if it has become so big?  Eventually it will get to a point where even if they make new products that are highly profitable, because they are so big already that may translate into single digit growth.  They would need monster success from new capital deployed just to keep up a modest growth rate.It does look like Apple still has a lot of growth potential though.  They are far from 100% of the phone/pc/device market, and there are still ways they can capture more revenue from its users from the app store, fintech, streaming media, and so on.  Eventually it will start reaching a limit, but I don't see that limit yet.  The bigger risk around Apple is its dependency on Asia for production and sales, and how China may upset all that.

Raised full year guidance on the last ER. Haven’t done too much more research into them, but it’s kind of funny to think a store like that has been outperforming the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 07:21:40'] Look at the 5Y chart on the S&P.  The pricing action really looks almost exactly like the "disbelief" part of the market cycle where it slowly climbs the wall of worry.  Especially September to March action.With labor participation still well below historical highs, potential relaxation of immigration, inflation clearly not spiraling, there is absolutely no reason to believe the economy cannot keep growing.  With trillions of cash on the sidelines wanting to desperately find an entry point... hard to argue we haven't seen bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 17:55:42'] There was no reason for this rally today. Inflation going to come in hot again. Anyone that thinks inflation has been conquered hasn’t been grocery shopping within the past month. Used car prices also creeping back up. These no reason pumps are hilarious. The refuse to let this market bottom and we are probably going to be stuck on this range for the next few years with no real growth as inflation continues to run rampant. Disinflation my ass.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 11:40:52'] Today's rally in equities correlated with a relatively large decline in longer term yields. Perhaps Costco's earnings acted as a bellwether of what market participants may anticipate coming up for the economy. ISM data may have contributed as well.There's been talk that indicates that a possible recession would actually be bullish for stocks. Today price action seems to be suggestive of that theory.

POST: ['2023-01-11 07:49:25'] POST TITLE: b"Netflix is the worst FAANGM investment and it's getting worse"
POST_TEXT: b'Source: The FAANMGs: Google Is A Buy, Netflix Is A Goodbye\n\nNFLX holds $6.1 billion in cash equivalents and has $13.9b in long-term debt. Of the other five companies, with $41.8 billion at the end of last quarter, META has the lowest level of cash and equivalents.\n\nNFLX had $21.57 billion in content obligations at the end of last quarter, and $4.3 billion of that will be spent within the next year. Herein lies a major stumbling block for me when I consider NFLX as an investment.\n\nCompetition within streaming companies results in enormous capex devoted to content creation. It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers, and that includes the likes of Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, each of which is now in competition with NFLX.\n\nHowever, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet have a great deal of FCF to potentially devote to content efforts. For example, Alphabet generated $69.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow. Trailing 12-month free cash flow for NFLX was a relatively paltry '

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 09:03:00'] Netflix literally only joined that group because they didn't want to call it "FAAGM"
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 09:23:03'] Honestly anytime a company gets worked into an acronym that’s supposed to signify a good investment or a company becomes “holy”, it concerns me. It’s good for the stock price in the short term but it can also cause a bubble to form. That’s not universal but what I’m saying is companies change. It’s been about a decade since Cramer uttered the word FAANG and not all of those companies are what they were. Amazon has a PE over 80, both Facebook and Netflix had >70% plunges, and there are newer companies on the block which would be better fits. Plus Cramer. Eww.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 13:40:41'] Cash/assets or quick ratio is better than looking at aggregate cash holdings. Just because a company has more cash than another doesn’t really mean anything since you have to adjust for the size of the business. Just an fyi, cash/assets makes more sense when comparing companies of different sizes..

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 16:23:18'] Netflix’s recurring revenue and sub base could be stickier than you think. To the effect that they may even be a recession resistant name since you could argue it’s the last subscription to cut. I also think that their content ecosystem and developed brands is strong relative to competition and they have the best penetration to introduce better targeted/marketed content to the biggest audience. The data they have on viewer preferences is the best and I think they are able to leverage this against competition that may need higher per sub investment to develop the write content mix.I would also reframe your point about their competition. You could argue they have a competitive advantage as a pure play in the space. The other big names are diversified and while that brings resource and expertise I think in the end, higher capex properties, like media production and distribution, may be candidates for divestitures/spin offs. Not to say bigger players couldn’t win but it’s not a sure thing just because they have deeper pockets.

Not to say it isnt justified given their performances are phenomenal but all upside predictions are pricing in growth using assumptions and it is very possible they can drop a significant amount still. Although they are cheaper than before i wouldnt compare to previous levels as it wouldnt mean much. I prefer to pick my investment without using as little assumptions as possible: I picked META at $92 (250B cap at the time, 180B assets,  $105b tangible, 60B cash and marketable securities, strong FCF on a TTM, strong rev and margins close to peak) but im getting ready to sell incase things go south since things seem to be going to well for my liking.  I also chose to invest in DIS (got in at $90ish) instead of NFLX although retrospectively i would have done much better doing the opposite, but i still think it is better from a risk/reward perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:29:10'] Yeah, I don't see where Netflix goes from here. Before, Netflix was gobbling up all kinds of collections of movies and TV. Then they were expanding into making their own originals and many of those were really successful. Then the pandemic happened where people were consuming tons of TV. Now? All three of those are still going on, but I don't know if it's quite enough to maintain the massive growth of the past. Users have such high expectations of Netflix, so Netflix has to spend so much money to keep up, especially when there are competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 02:59:36'] Just my opinion, but streaming isn’t going anywhere and Netflix is optimizing for higher monthly payments. This will work because they have good addicting content. They may not grow to the moon, but they will continue to grow.Google however, is a one-trick-pony (search) masquerading as a conglomeration (Alphabet) - None of Google’s other ventures amount to anything.  The problem Google has is that ChatGPT and other AI is just about to upend search in a huge way (it’s really, really disruptive and yes, it’s that good). And once someone else wins search, Google is effectively dead overnight. Don’t think Google is dead overnight? I present to you that Google itself killed Yahoo as the default internet “start page” practically overnight. That’s *how* Google became Google.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 05:17:20'] I have a great degree of respect for Netflix as a tech company because they have been a legitimate innovator in terms of building a very intelligent SoA system, tons of microservices, their architecture and blogs are very fascinating reads to see how a world class organization handles it's data and systems. They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.However today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.Middle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.Netflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. I think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience. A true event that they have to capture at the designated time because otherwise they feel left out when their peers are talking about it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 06:03:41'] It's even worse than you lay out.  NFLX debt and content obligations are so much more crippling than most realize.  And their debt is all rolling over into a terrible credit environment.  Their clueless execs have pledged to keep increasing content spend, which they can't afford, and soon, won't be able to finance either.  And content costs will be bid up by their much richer competitors.  They hit customer saturation several years ago, and hid it with their silly metrics.  They hit price saturation at covid re-opening.  So they can't grow subs, and they can't charge them more... but they have to.  Their funky and false way of claiming "profitability" won't hold up to tougher scrutiny.They're doing their usual shell game of pretending there's growth with the shiny object of ad-tier.  But you don't make an ad-service that requires customers to sign up and pay.  That's why they had to refund all their advertisers.  And the ad-tier will cannibalize their existing subs/pricing anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 11:15:46'] >It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers.It's not a vicious cycle, it's theoretically a virtuous cycle when done correctly. In fact, it is the bedrock of Netflix's business model. [Check out Netflix's flywheel](https://jenvandermeer.org/2020/06/09/netflix-business-model-teardown/)You cannot compare Google and Netflix. They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)Also, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).Their gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. TLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't. Very different companies.

POST_TEXT: b'I just started a year and a half ago rather late in life unfortunately (45) after being left high 5 figures by 92y grandmother.\n\nAnyways I\'ve got a diverse account(s) and am wondering when you know to trim a position, especially ones that have done well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 16:11:35'] If you sell AAPL, all or part, what are you going to do with the proceeds? I'm not even talking about taxes, let's just leave that out of the equation right now...So far AAPL has returned you some 45%. What stock has the LT history, marketshare, and name recognition that AAPL has that you think will be a better parking spot for your cash? You need to have an answer to that question before you sell. Even if your answer is "imma get hella weed & blow and pimp my ride like its 1999" thats fine, its your money. But if you're like, just going to sit on cash, leave it where it is. Someday, AAPL won't be the largest most successful company on the planet, but that day isn't tomorrow. Maybe learn some ThetaGang option strategies or something...
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-23 15:34:39'] If you plan to hold AAPL for the long term, then you don’t sell. “Taking profits” are for specs and short term trading/ investments. As per your question of when to sell out of a position: if you can put the money after sale to better use elsewhere, then you should sell. For instance, you invested in Co. A and over 5 years it has returned 1% and you see that the long term prospects of the company won’t be changing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-24 06:06:05'] I totally understand not wanting a position to take up a lot of your portfolio. I assume you want to diversify it right?I would say to base it on your taxes and how much you can put into retirement funds.If you dont already have a 401k or IRA or Roth IRA, then cut as much as you need to max a Roth which will be a big advantage later on.Then its just a matter of how much more tax you want to pay. Long term capital gains have brackets and in theory, you could pay 0% tax if you make no other income. In such a case, definitely take advantage of that by selling enough to have $40k of capital gains or whatever it is now. Cant beat tax free! After that it becomes around 15% or so.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 11:19:02'] Though AAPL is a ‘hold forever’ stock, having in excess of 40% total portfolio allotment is a bit much.  Traditionally, $AAPL’s best performance is from May through August each year.  The annual upturn in performance combined with the coming tax increase may suggest it is time to trim back your holdings and diversify.  You might consider selling 1/5 to 1/4 of your position in tranches through the summer.  Keep some or all in cash until the inevitable November / Thanksgiving downturn in the market.  Remember - the bears come out for Thanksgiving, while the bulls come out for Christmas.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 07:20:07'] Well if you're going to follow Cramer, he also says "own Apple, don't trade it". Your intention doesn't seem to be about trading it to buy back on a pullback, but in having portfolio discipline.  I wouldn't necessarily be scared at 11% concentration, but you need to determine what your risk tolerance is for you.If you do decide you want to sell, perhaps consider selling covered calls (presuming you have at least 100 shares).  It allows you to capture a little extra upside, and if it drops...you got some premium while your holdings drop back to a non-outsized position.  When it rises again, sell more calls.If dropping 100 shares is too much, I would wait until it finishes another strong run (obviously hard to call a top).  AAPL is trending up but isn't at an all time high.  Unless you're losing sleep over it, I would wait to see what it does after earnings this week.  If it has a strong pop after earnings, probably your time to trim.  If not...again, you're probably back to a position you can leave alone until it becomes an outsized part of your portfolio again.At the end of the day, do what works for you, and whatever allows you to sleep better at night without worrying/thinking about it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 05:45:01'] In a better place than you are today.Honestly with growing focus on privacy and tech, Apple is set up to be king of the world, especially as they build their own chips with embedded AI capabilities.  A lot of the compute will now happen directly on the device.  They’re already a closed loop system.  And other tech has far more (intentionally or unintentionally) invasive practices.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 08:38:04'] At this point their massive values might limit their potential upside. And past performance doesn't predict future etc.It's much better than two randomly chosen companies, for sure. They are great and hugely profitable businesses. But it's impossible to say if they will over/underperform the market over the next 5. Also with so little diversification, maybe one of those will do great and the other one stagnates, eating all the sweet growth. I would definitely go for a fund that holds those two, but also other things. (And I have.)

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-11 06:35:13'] No one says that if you pick great companies you're guaranteed to gain over 9 months. 9 months is a tiny amount of time when it comes to investing.

Just don’t blame other people for giving bad advice, blame yourself for accepting bad advice and buying apple when it was clearly overvalued.  It will grow into its valuation, but that takes time.

I'm sure you can at least sell it with some profits within the next 6-8 months. Especially with the traditional events happening in September and sales increasing around Christmas/holidays as well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 09:28:46'] AAPL is a great stock and I will never own it for the exact reason you are basically discussing. This has a massive float and market cap and will be a slow mover forever. It will go up, but I do not buy stocks that cannot 5x in 5 years maximum. This will never 5x. Apple is for the rich or for people who are extremely safe and conservative and scared of their own shadow. You could also use it to hedge a lot of high risk plays. If I had half a million dollars, I would put it into AAPL bc I would be down to make a certain 250k with it in a couple years. I would never put 500 dollars into AAPL because  wtf is the point. However, as a buyer of Apple, you should know this and should not be expecting decent gains (like 35% maybe) for another year. Wait for a FB dip (they come all the time) and buy that instead. FB will 3x in 7 or 8 years. AAPL will not.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 11:01:45'] anything I see a price worth buying I just add on to my holdings. I don’t particularly try to anticipate how low it will go. If it drops to 180 next month, just buy more, it’s that simple. Also for most ‘small time’ investors like me (i would define those as people who are buying stocks monthly/quarterly etc with your paycheck), I think a regular DCA into stocks is just a steady way to go. Sure you wont see explosive returns, but in return I get a good sleep everyday knowing that since I’m not capable of beating the odds ill just be content with following the benchmark or buying stocks that I researched on / have knowledge about. Why don’t I get into TSLA or SE or any other explosive stock is just for one reason, I don’t know its business model at all and buying the stock is literally a gamble for me.P/S: I usually invest 1k usd a month into a global ETF, and only add to some individual positions as and when I have extra cash lying around.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-18 12:47:44'] MSFT just has the more solid business model. I have owned Apple pretty continuously in some amount since the dip on it began, but I never really have liked it. I just see it as too closely linked to having a devoted base that is willing to buy new, somewhat overpriced products. I know they have lots of good stuff going for them (good products, lots of cash on hand, some other revenue streams) but they just are not as embedded in as many irreplaceable areas as MSFT. So, I will probably buy more MSFT if I think its little dip has more or less stabilized, whereas I would not buy back into Apple unless I felt like it had really reached an attractive valuation.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-19 00:45:45'] These stocks are no lower then they were in august. So I believe we have very different opinions on what a dip is.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 05:08:37'] Nothing wrong with some blue chips. The other 80% depends on your risk profile. The blue chips can offset loses if you're risk heavy, or they can provide long term fairly stable growth and dividends to offset higher volatility elsewhere

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:00:10'] I bought AAPL 150c 10/15 in mid-July and it's been nothing but crap for me
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 15:49:50'] It's already struggling to get over 150
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:00:53'] The likelihood that Apple rises 10-15% within a 3 month period is highly unlikely unless they come out with some big news. The TSM price hike in chips will result in a higher price for the iPhone 13, however, this won’t stop consumers from purchasing new products. IMO, the Fed will have to taper earlier than they intend to, which could result in a 5-10% correction like some analysts are saying (if you were buying shares this wouldn’t matter, but your up against Theta). I personally would buy this same strike, but after the Jackson Hole meeting tomorrow, and further out. (Not financial advise, just my opinion). Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:38:04'] AAPL is a toss. It could slow down in September and October and ride the following months or the opposite. I’m betting on shares instead of options.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 19:04:04'] Apple at $165/share would make it a 2.69 trillion dollar companyI don't think they will be able to add on another 250 billion into their market cap by EOY...good luck
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:14:14'] Quite the gambler you are. Buy shares instead of options so you aren't constricted to time frames.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 18:06:10'] I’ve been playing aapl for the past 6 weeks- trying to catch a break out- and it’s been going no where. Burning theta every day. It’s consolidating, and technically could go either way… however, I think it goes lower. They’ve been selling all the pops and it’s been far weaker than other tech stocks. Not only that, but September is a very weak month for aapl (all tech stocks, actually). Plus, we have a potential breakout in bond yields- which doesn’t bode well for aapl.I really thought it would make one last attempt to break 150 at the end of this month, but it’s not looking good. I’m giving up on it for now. I think the best approach is to revisit the trade in October.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 19:34:17'] Got out after it broke trend. Money better spent elsewhere for now
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 06:47:48'] Could you do PMCCs between now and then on that option, to lower your cost basis on the premium you paid? One way to hedge against your fear it won’t get there.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 15:56:58'] Why not just buy a few shares and hold them for 10 years?  AAPL will be over $200 in 2023 I bet.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:13:51'] I’ve been selling covered calls 2-3 months out   Sold some $175 November calls for $120 a contract. Seems like a win win
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 17:01:19'] Pretty sure Tim Cook just sold around 5 million shares if that means anything to you. Market's hanging by a thread rn as you can tell just by looking at the yearly chart and seeing the occasional panic drops that always rebound the next day. I could see it continuing to climb, but all it takes is some big news (Interest rates/inflation/jobs report) to shake things up. Still I think you should be fine, but what do I know I can't speak for the market
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:20:09'] Well at least they are options..New iPhone should be out before then may run...good luckAapl doesn't do anyone wrong

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:27:36'] You're trying to time the market. Not very satisfying
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 15:54:10'] 150 is where it resistance is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:05:00'] I bought some calls prior to quarterlies, and, wow what a mistake. Seem the market thinks they’re priced to perfection. If you don’t lose too much to time decay they’ll pop right before the next quarterly results.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:26:12'] covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 21:43:39'] Well, I like AAPL long term but this is a risky and speculative trade. Could pay off but the odds are not on your side.You could have opened a bull call spread at $145/$150 for the same expiration date for a $2.70 debit. This trade will yield an 85% return so long as AAPL is trading at $150 at expiration, more or less where it is today.For comparison, the $165 call closed today at $1.79. So you would need Apple to close at $168.31 in order to get the same rate of return as the spread trade. That means to get the same return, the stock price needs to be 12.2% higher than it does for the spread. The risk/reward is pretty unfavorable.I like the spread, but I would not have bought the $165 call. There’s too much uncertainty in today’s prices to make that a safe bet. I’d have been more likely to support this trade a year ago when the market was 25% lower.Having said that, AAPL is a rock solid company and this could print if the economy stays on track and AAPL has a good earnings call and blowout iPhone launch. Blowout because analysts’ expectations are already set so high.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 10:19:03'] They’re raising prices to cover the increase in the cost of chips. By how much is anyone’s guess. As is what affect it will have on the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 16:18:33'] hell, im waiting for it to go back down to $119.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 18:09:06'] Reddit thinks it won't hit 150, so take out a loan for aapl
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 19:01:06'] I added a few more shares today.  It's Apple, it goes up over time every time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 05:38:57'] U.S. employers added a whopping 517,000 (estimates of 188,000)  jobs in January. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest since 1969.After population adjustments, labor force participation is still a soggy 62.4%, well below its pre-pandemic 63.3%. The labor force shortfall of about 3.5 million workers is constraining job growth, as high as it is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 11:07:12'] Now that I think about it, Amazon has been a pretty bad investment over the last 5 years. It seems like each time it goes on a run it misses earnings and falls back down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:11:15'] 517k jobs in a month is great and upward revisions to prior months. Maybe this is the new normal-we had large periods where rates were 5-6% or higher and the economies went along great. if employment stays put, the fed may pause if inflation stabilizes-which it seems to be doing and not cut. Zero percent rates were bizarre and I believe some countries even had negative interests-where you had to pay to keep money?Hopefully it all works out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 08:35:29'] We are so back
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 07:27:48'] Apple up 4%, lmao
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 08:25:05'] 517k jobs in one month is quite the number. I wonder if this si the roaring 20s all ove ragain and we are looking at new ATH again. It is so odd-but it is what it is. No matter what you throw at it-good news, bad news the market rallies furiously. Look at AAPL today -almost touched 157 on earnings misses. TSLA is hovering around 200. it seems like a bullish frenzy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:33:39'] The BLS did do some revisions to how they categorize jobs by sector, but I don't think that should impact the total number. There is a good chance this is partly just statistical noise. Even still, if we *halve* the jobs added count and include the 71K added to previous months (which would have happened without any revisions to methodology), this is a monstrous report.I continue to be a macro-bull but slightly closer to just mildly bullish for the stock market. Definitely more room to raise rates a bit more. Soft landing still looking good since wage growth slowed slightly. A 2023 recession just got pushed back to Q4 or 2024 in my view.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 07:49:01'] I remember the old days when companies have awesome earning reports and the stock plumming. I prefer today's market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:14:29'] I'm starting to think terminal rate could end up closer to 5.5-6% if China demand for commodities drives inflation like I'm anticipating. Pharma, Oil, and Healthcare are already at a crazy premium though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 08:06:04'] Interesting question from Twitter (Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg) that I'm paraphrasing:If economic activity is heating up but inflation is cooling down, is the reduction in inflation due to the Fed?"Rate hikes haven't kicked in yet" folks, curious your explanation too. The transitory explanation for inflation said it was all temporary supply chain issues. Then we all said transitory was wrong because it turns out we just had a booming economy flush with money. Then why is inflation cooling? (it unambiguously is based on monthly CPI or core CPI reports, just not as quickly as we'd like)If this is all due to the Fed mostly, you'd expect economic activity to be cooling down more severely.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 08:19:07'] I'm sitting this out. Made some money off the Oct lows but completely missed this one. I feel awful that I missed the boat, but I cannot chase this thing. I have respect for people that can pivot quickly and not hold on too hard to fundamentals.

We have **disinflation** while jobs are still strong, showing that yes Chair Powell can in fact plausibly, gently land the beast known as the US economy.Forgot who said it yesterday but G.O.A.T.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 12:03:12'] For those of you who don't understand why Apple is up today. Tim Apple basically said that without supply chain and forex issues, iPhone sales would have been flat YoY. That is a huge accomplishment considering the current environment. What's more, Lucas said that 1Q24 revenue will be relatively the same as 4Q23. Meaning, sales were not lost but just pushed back. Also, services was 20% of total revenue with 70%+ margins. It grew slightly but it is too hard to ignore at this point and the PE expansion is justified. Look at some of the other software companies' PE. With 2B installed base upgrading every few years and buying up other products/services in the meantime, Apple did great considering the environment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 05:57:38'] Payroll number and disappointing earnings/forecasts should pretty much kill the rally.  The Fed says they're going to keep hiking rates and for whatever reason no one listened.  You aren't getting to 5% unemployment with blowout job numbers.

Those two scenarios seem like they'd be incompatible- either no recession and rates stay at or above 5-5.25% through year end or growth collapses and rates cut imo. If you're gonna trade SQQQ, that risk reward is looking decent here. But for retirement, as always just DCA and ignore trading.

If it were to trade twice cheaper I'd still think they are quite highly priced. But here's what I found, a quick trade, they seem to nail Q4 earnings consistently prolly because they do advertising and Q4 is Christmas quarter.So I kinda expect them to have relatively good earnings, like 450m$ Rev and maybe above 50m$ in net income. Could the stock rise the 15 of February (it's their earnings date)? Is it a good earnings play? What you guys think? I don't know for sure kinda wanna try.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 06:45:04'] Services PMI is going to remain resilient over the next couple months. Quite a few companies have jacked up prices and a tight wage market means increased overhead, despite the layoffs that already occurred. The US is predominantly a service economy which is why JPow is concerned about this.Anecdotally, there have been many increases in costs for me the last month or so. Streaming services, electric bill, insurance, etc that have not yet been counted services PMI. Others are planned, like Microsoft announced increases in Xbox (probably game pass) that haven’t happened yet.And there is the fact that many subscription services are wants vs needs, and very easy to cancel at a time where consumers have exhausted their savings. So to justify keeping these, or paying more, people will expect wage increases.What does all of this mean? Sustained inflation expectations all around.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 08:02:24'] Yields starting to climb again after job report, wondering how much upside stocks have left when none of it was from good earnings, but rather multiple expansion.I'm just not seeing the justification other than "just DCA because at some point it will be higher, who cares about multiples or return on capital" as the risk/reward ratio has been increasing rapidly.Yeah, I'm still going to put money in, but it's not going to be towards equity indices.

The other 3 are big caps but they are around their all time high. Baba is the most volatile and yet the most undervalued (relatively). I would consider it, it's a safe bet long term, but I would still wait for a dip. I would also keep an eye on Facebook, that's also relatevely undervalued. If you want more risk (and more reward of course) look into Solar Wind.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 01:28:54'] Don’t sell.  Dips happen because it is the nature of stocks.  I have held Apple for 7+ years now and do not regret it.  Went through 7-1 and 4-1 splits and lived through many dips.  Dips only matter when you sell during dips.  Good luck.  📈

Im waiting until we really know their plans in the EV space. Not saying the stock will go down much, but the growth potential just isnt there In my mind. Not a financial advisor.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 21:20:18'] I'd probably write a 4/30 covered call 10% up day of earnings and hold, or sell before earnings.  Depends on where you think AAPL is gonna go.Real way to play AAPL is to invest - hold shares, when it tanks buy LEAPs and ride it up.  Second best way is to buy options and sell into events and earnings.  I made decent money buying low IV 4/23 calls last Friday and selling before the 4/20 event, and I'm looking to jump in on IV crushed calls tomorrow or Friday and sell them before earnings when IV is up.  I'm holding a lot of shares and LEAPs and intend to just hold but flip weeklies on events, never hold those weeklies through the event tho

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-27 01:20:03'] There are a lot of surer and more profitable bets than shorting AAPL, including just holding long SP 500 and holding long AAPL. At best, AAPL will fall 30% and that's the limit of your winning (unless you use margin). The more likely scenario is that one of your prediction fail to materialize and the opportunity cost eats away your theoretical winning. Shorts have been slaughtered in 2021 due to the massive liquidity keeping businesses with way worse fundamentals than AAPL afloat (Hertz, GME, AMC, etc.) tl:dr, there are easier fishes to fry.

What's the best way to express your idea in the market? How and when are you going to exit the position? You want to think these things in advance.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-17 06:11:48'] October 16, 1987; I was a stockbroker playing index options in my own account. I had in my hand an order for Nov OEX Puts; that day was expiration for Octs. I decided to not put in the order, as I figured the markets would calm over the weekend. We all know what happened Monday; that trade would have given me a seven-figure gain by Tuesday. It hurt like a fucker at the time, but I survived. Onward we trudge.

You don’t sell a lotto ticket after scratching it 3/4 of the way. You go the distance and scratch the whole thing. Next time, size down so you can go to broke if you need to. You don’t sell lottery tickets. You either win or you lose. No in between. Get 20 @ .10 next time instead of 75.

Failure is not predictable and persistence is key.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-16 21:55:48'] This is rough. I bought shares a few weeks ago on the same sentiment as you - I'm wishing I had dipped into the options.It is a missed opportunity, but on the bright side it's an opportunity you recognized for yourself. Your brain still works and new opportunities will present themselves. Short term I'd be cautious not to rush to try to "make up" for this. I am curious who was on the other end of that trade that was able to take advantage of your limit order. Was it your broker? My guess is some sharks knew the news as soon as it came out and were able to act quickly on a surefire huge win. I guess my questions would be at what time did the news come out and at what time did these options trade? Someone somewhere got a cheap, quick, easy win...who?

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-17 00:45:23'] Basically ask yourself what could you have feasibly done different to realise those gains? Was there any way of knowing that a decision was coming out? Ask yourself, if you were so certain, why didn't you just roll onto a later expiry. If you were so certain in Jan what changed? Or did you let the emotion of the losses cloud your judgement. As mentioned it's a lesson in trading use it.

Check out the chart after 12/19/2017....it was literally almost never that low again and hit a high of .0266. Do you have any idea what 3,333,333 shares is worth at .022? $73,333.32. That's what my $2k investment would have been worth. It's small comfort, but I tell myself:1. I wouldn't have sold right at the high. I likely wouldn't have sold even halfway to it, as my "oh crap" capital preservation instincts would kick in2. I'm lucky to have made any money. Never put any $ into a lotto penny stock that you can't afford to lose (though, that's also what motivated me to sell at .0007).In the end it's just money. It's a tool. You just have a slightly smaller shovel to do your digging with. Keep your longer term goals in mind and stick w/ the plan. You'll get there. The worst thing you can do is "revenge trade" and try to make it back with another home-run play. Stay the course!

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-17 08:15:10'] We’ve all made trades where we made big mistakes and lost money. We’ve all made trades where we made big mistakes and didn’t make money when we could have. We’ve made good trades and bad trades, but you can’t hold onto any of those. Live to trade another day and if you’re trading style is too stressful for you and causes regret or FOMO, change your trading strategy. Living with regret or false hope is not a happy way to live. It’s just money , and it’s not worth sacrificing your happiness because you COULD have made money, but didn’t.  I COULD have chosen a different career path. Who knows how much money I COULD have made had I chosen otherwise. Or maybe I would have made less and dealt with other struggles instead. I’ll never know because that’s not the decision I made. Life is just a series of outcomes based on the decisions you make- some will be good, some will be awful, and some will be great. You have to be okay with any of those outcomes and trust that you made the best decision you could knowing what you knew then.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-17 11:28:57'] Man.. I’ve screwed up too many times majorly so far, and I’m still young enough to make plenty more mistakes. I screwed up first with bitcoin. Missed out on several million by getting out before it was popular. I screwed up on AMD right after that. Had 2500 shares I bought at $2.34/ share. I sold out because I was bitcoin bitter. I screwed up buying silver the day before it crashed.. I’ve made several other big screw ups, but you get the point. There are so many things we do right, but one thing I have learned is that you never make a hasty decision. When your gut is telling you something, dig into why it is doing it. When you’re compelled to act.. take at least a second while you’re coherent to reconsider. How do you go on? The same way you did before you made the mistake only with a little more knowledge.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-16 16:06:18'] We all make mistakes. I have an extremely good track record ever since taking investing seriously until I did 30 hours of DD in a week. I knew everything there was to know about RGSE. I bought in at .37 and .56 before their climb to .80 back in November. I didn't make a true exit strategy. I didn't sell and now am bag-holding down 80%. Went from looking at almost 80% profit to 80% loss. Company could now be on the edge of bankruptcy and I could lose a massive chunk of my portfolio.  It's part of the life. Mistakes are costly and they do happen. It's why it's so important to make true strategies and hold to them.&#x200B;Just because you mess up one time doesn't mean you're a bad trader. It doesn't mean you won't ever make money or you're stupid. It means you just didn't cover EVERY SINGLE basis and part of the plan.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 05:47:20'] I'm older -- so I'm going to drop the 10k in SLG.monthly dividend that I can use or re-invest.  During the next 5 years I see an economic recovery so the stock going back up to it's pre-pandemic level.(current dividend would get me a little over 3 grand over the 5 years.  if the stock price goes up $20 gets me another 3 grand.  if it goes up $40 to the pre pandemic level I've almost doubled the money.  Not to mention their dividend would probably go back up to pre-pandemnic level and the 3 grand in div would be higher as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 23:51:58'] SoFi. Wouldn't be surprised if this is perceived as one of the most risky stocks among the recommendations, but I think the upside potential is enormous and I love using their products. Because of their status quo breaking initial offerings/welcome bonuses/great marketing, 50% of the people I recommend SoFi to switch from their current banks and every single one (only 8 so obviously minimal sampling) has sung it's praises to me. Them upping their apy on checking and savings every few weeks since I switched last year has been mind blowing and competitively significant. The company and products are easy to love and they are growing rapidly so I gotta hope the stock performs accordingly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 10:03:56'] Google, Microsoft, Amazon, they're the most obvious bets... However, the tech sector will be facing issues over the next few years. Even Satya Nadella said it.There's a couple of other choices like Realty Income, VICI, Agree Realty which I think will do well over the next 5 years although you'll a dividend-reinvestment plan. They will do good if we face sub-optimal economic growth and higher-than-average inflation which is where we're heading towards in my opinion.If we're seeing another round of the 70s, energy companies will outperform over the next few years. Think Philips 66, Marathon Petroleum, Valero Energy, etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 00:50:40'] Tesla.Their numbers look better by the quarter (particularly when comparing to where all the others are heading) and their energy business is just getting started. The world will build up massive amounts of storage for renewables over the next ten years (at least) and anyone who has a turnkey solution and can deliver in a timely manner at scale will make bank.Plus, I like that they are constantly innovating and trying to break into new markets - or even creating new markets from scratch - instead of doing 'same old, same old' like everyone else. This occasionally fails (as it to be expected with speculative endeavors)...but when it works ...oh boy.

Out of about 60 million houses only 6 million are less than 10 years old. They are going to need A LOT of maintenance. There’s also a housing shortage, new houses need to be built and contractors tend to like Home Depot. They also offer a dividend which is pretty solid. On a personal level their app/website has really easy online ordering, I’d say on par to Amazon but for actual home maintenance stuff.

Currently really expensive at the moment so could probably find a cheaper stock to dividend pump, but if I have to hold it for ten years I trust Cat to kind of make up for it. Especially with how it’s been constantly on the rise for years now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 11:34:55'] Coke because as long as population grows I just don’t see how you could mess up an easy money maker like a bottling company. I mean it’s possible a ban on bottles but not probable. But then again Chevron not only has a lock on demand as population grows but it also has a lock on supply as it’s a non renewable resource. But eh 5 years isn’t going to change much now you want a non renewable resource that in 40 years will be in more demand than gas check out soil I don’t know what companies sell soil like the kind we can grow food in but we are running out and when it’s gone no food so that’s more important than gas water anything

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 11:43:20'] CBDNF. A little company that no one knows about. They did $1 million in revenue last year but bought a company in December that does $50 million per year in revenue. They quietly announced completing the acquisition but did not announce how big it actually is. The stock is $.05-$.07 now. I expect it will be over $1.00 in the next 12-18 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 13:11:36'] I think there is plenty of good retail growth opportunity ahead for engaged investors.  One of the best examples is 5G/6G integration happening all around us invisibly, and it will continue through the rest of the decade.  That’s my play. Nothing today touches on everything, everywhere all at once like ubiquitous fast, wide, and secure wireless.  It will continue to do so for some time to come.  My 5 year bet would be QCOM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 13:16:05'] Many good ideas here that I agree with, but I'll throw something more controversial: INTC (Intel).  Why?  It's really cheap from a P/E perspective which reflects that the market thinks they'll lose significant market share.  The worst case scenario is kind of already priced in.So it leaves you with a very realistic upside risk IMO.Plus: even if they loose market share (I think they will, a little), the Cloud market is growing exponentially (demand) whereas CPU/GPU performance is no longer growing exponentially, so the CPU market will have to grow exponentially as well, follow my logic?  There's going to be a need for MUCH more CPU in the future.Also: In the meantime, you get paid a very nice dividend, so even if the stock doesn't grow, you've made money.I've read their last i5 is faster than the best AMD by the way, but that's not even my point.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 03:21:14'] Well at least nobody can make the argument that this market doesnt give you chances to get out of your positions, what an insane runup in some of these names.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 07:50:34'] Its looking like WBD Hogwarts Legacy is a massive hit. Sold 56% more in opening week in Europe than Elden Ring did last year. Outside of Call of Duty and FIFA, the biggest game launch since 2018's Red Dead Redemption 2.I didnt have WBD releasing a GOTY candidate on my 2023 bingo card as everyone was focused on their debt and them canceling shows last year. No one mentioned the potential of their gaming studio segment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 08:15:28'] DOJ is siding with Norfolk Southern in a Supreme Court case that could block lawsuits against the company. So looks like that company will get away with what happened in Ohio. I'd make a thread on it but when politics are involved those threads get locked/deleted.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 10:00:49'] Several stocks I own are selling off or are at attractive prices. Adding to CLFD, UFPI, FCX, PSCE.- CLFD has been trading around low 60s even after an excellent ER, mostly due to analyst fears about backlog falling and seasonality. Fundamentally very strong company that is very cheap right now.- UFPI is trading down some 8% just because... it was reclassified as a mid-cap stock instead of small-cap? This company has been thriving the entire time, pays a dividend, does share buybacks, consistently beats earnings, ... It's still up some 16% from my cost basis (I was up 31% a few days back), but I think cheap.- BTU is selling off on seaborne thermal prices falling, but... has nothing to do with the thermal prices it has locked in, or with met prices, which are rising. I'm likely not adding more since I already am loaded up (at slightly below today's prices). But if you missed a big earnings report bump, now could be a good time to enter. There will likely be some analyst upgrades coming up soon, and surety/reclamation announcements in the next 45 days- PSCE: Small cap energy ETF, trading down with crude. I'm a bit of an oil bull, and this ETF is a bit of a bet on crude oil since small cap US energy firms are more sensitive to its daily fluctuations. It has traded at a huge discount to its larger cap peers in $XLE, for good reason, so far more upside here than in XLE which is still near ATH despite short term crude sell-offs.- FCX: Copper has a bright future ahead. This stock is probably closer to fair value than the other stocks listed here. A 3-5 year DCA in my view. Copper undersupply cannot easily change, and I'm not betting on gloomy demand.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 08:18:30'] Why do some of the most influential economists think Fed will err strongly on the side of caution and tolerate 3%-4% inflation?  Why do they think 50bps talk is jawboning rhetoric and not reality?*IMO it has everything to do with the complex sociopolitical climate we live in today.* Americans have been fucked with emotionally now for a long time.  They suffered massively from the GFC, a deep and painful recession that they felt were caused by greedy elites and neglectful politicians.  Mainstreet paid the price, not Wall Street.  Obviously the reality is more complicated but that's the perception.Then came Covid.  The powers at be rightfully told us all to lockdown and we listened.  It was depressing and soul-crushing but it needed to be done and most us responsible people were careful, despite many deniers, anti-vaxxers and loonies not listening.Now Fed wants to crash the economy for the long-term health of the economy, sure sounds reasonable.  But again regular people pay the short-term price?  Hellll naww.  **We can't handle another crisis, we have reached the limit of crisis fatigue**.This is why even though the economy is actually super strong, tons of signs of underlying health and promise, ridiculous liquidity in the banking system, sentiment is at all-time lows.  Imagine telling people before this era unemployment would be near 60 year lows 3.4% and people are this gloomy.And this is why Fed will jawbone 50 bps like they have been, they're going to use rhetoric to its maximum.  But push comes to shove they're going to protect jobs, at least for the foreseeable future.  How will they deal with debt in the system?  By letting it inflate away.  Someone has to get fucked, this time around it's credit markets and bond investors.As Harvard economist Rogoff has said:>I don't think we're going to have a soft-landing by the way.  I think we're going to have a soft, but not the landing.  They're [the Fed] going to allow inflation to be elevated for longer, but they're going to *say it's going to get back to 2%,* we're just taking longer.  **That's going to be the rhetoric.**And this is why you stay fully invested and BTFD.  Debt is trash, cash is trash.  Puts are NOT *Da Wae.*Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.

I’m sure SPY will reach ATH again *someday*, but lots and lots of popular stocks certainly won’t ever again. And if it takes idk 5+ years before zero rates come back and SPY can finally go back to ATH, maybe it would be better to go all into bonds/fixed income instead and collect that 5-7% a year?

What seems more plausible is we are just going to side ways trade for a while.  Those who timed the bottom in tech crushed it.  But they probably lost a shit ton of money trying to do that on the massive sell off.  Don’t buy into that crap.  Only people crushing it are the algos.  It’s apparent rates are staying strong here.  Doesn’t mean stocks can’t keep going up because, honestly, the stock market is unpredictable.  You look at industrials, energies, and healthcare stocks = all been crushing it.  Nobody ever talks about the other 90% of the market here.   If recession is in the table or worst the SnP hasn’t even gotten started on any meaningful seal off.  It’s performing extremely well considering all things.  Just don’t size up or dca more than you can afford.  Don’t get caught up in the day to day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 23:17:34'] Ask your uncle and/or cousins how/where he bought the stock, and if he has any records, account numbers, etc. When you get your check, is there a brokerage name on it? If it’s housed at a major brokerage, then it might just be easier to open yours there, or you could have them transferred to another brokerage. Make sure your own account you open is just in your name though. I’m not sure if your uncle has to release the shares to you if he’s a joint owner of the apple shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-10 21:10:42'] I had bought a lot of AAPL in 2011 and after and at the time, it was a lot of money.  However that same initial amount, isn't so large now as our incomes & saving rates have grown quite a bit.  Until recently AAPL was my largest position due to its returns however some ofother buys since then started catching up ..and this year, AXP became my largest position. Back in 2011 & 2012, AAPL was some  50+% of my portfolio.Today it's my second largest position at 3% and my largest position AXP is just slightly more in a few basis points with tech tanking and financials ripping. As you grow in your career and family life, you make more money, save more, invest more, have large distribution events etc so making those risky calculated bets when you are younger made sense to me.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-30 16:49:03'] It's of course incredibly important to not put all your eggs in one basket... but 'bubble bursting' on the tech sector is not something that would play out like the .dot com burst in the early 2000s.  Speculators were literally lining up to give anyone with an Internet idea their money, the sector was full of junk companies.  Now you have companies like MSFT, AMZN, etc that are incredibly solid companies that will rise and fall with the markets and independently based on their own performance... but the likelihood that one day everyone is like this 'Internet/Computer' thing is going nowhere and just pull their money out of the sector is very unlikely. But adding an ETF that isn't tech heavy as part of a balanced portfolio is a good idea... I'll be watching/researching the ideas here.

If it dips for some reason over the next week, I would hold through earnings.

There’s been a few jumps recently and they did hit an all time high. I suspect we’ll see a correction after earnings but I could be totally wrong.  The 2% gains over the last few days makes me think we’ll see a drop. After seeing GME though, I have no idea what will happen.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 18:42:13'] 30% in two stocks is exceptionally aggressive/overweight, IMO Great stocks though, so if you're dead set on doing it, these are good choices.I get that GOOGL is a high dollar stock, so one share can immediately throw off allocations.  But AAPL doesn't need to. IMO, I'd rather see you buy 1 share of GOOGL (get the class A stock) @ $2317, then 9 shares of AAPL at a total of around $1150 and maybe 5 shares of HON to help balance you out a bit more But again, my humble opinion.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey! So Ive been trading for about three years now. Ive done penny stocks and options where Ive sat and stared at charts all day, tried to hold long term investments with the little money I had, and basically turned 400 into 600. \n\nThis was mainly meant as practice for when I graduated university so I was familiar with investing without risking much and Id like some opinions on my current idea for an investment strategy. I opened a brokerage account (not IRA) on Fidelity after switching from RH and plan on either doing: 100 in SPY, VOO, AAPL, and AMZN or just 200 in SPY and VOO. Then eventually try and hold in the money SPY calls 6 months to a year out once I build more capital. \n\nIm also aware that Im young, inexperienced, and dont really have anyone to go to with investing experience. Any advice Id appreciate!'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 08:42:03'] This is the best advice you will ever get: when you get a job, put some FU money aside to cover 3 months of your expenses. You do that then proceed to max out your 401(k) with whatever broad based market index fund if you can. If you can manage that, open a tIRA and max that with whatever broad based market index fund. If you can manage that, open a regular brokerage and max that with whatever broad based index fund. Stocks, Options, or whatever. Pfft. You’ll get a better return if you focus on your career and keep dumping money into your index funds.

POST_TEXT: b"I have the feeling that borders and economic isolation could become a bigger issue than we currently anticipate. Countries are realizing that there are irreconcilable differences in their political ideologies and that domestic production is crucial for security reasons. At first I obviosuly thought of the Russian market which is quite small and shouldn't concern us too much, but it seems like the current events are also escalating the fundamental differences between the US and China. An economic isolation of China would be a huge blow to companies that have a large customer base there. I am mainly thinking of everybodies darlings like AAPL or TSLA but also the other way around like BABA or even TSMC. Basically highly globalized companies whose revenue depend quite heavily on foreign markets.\n\nI am aware that this is a somewhat doomsday scenario but would enjoy your opinion on the topic!"

I mean, seriously, how many 5 year olds can say they've outperformed the S&P 500? Not many, that's for sure. In fact, I'm thinking of just copying her investment strategy. I mean, who wouldn't want to follow the lead of a kid who's making investment picks based on her love of cheese pizza and vanilla milkshakes?    Of course, it's worth keeping in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results, and that no one – not even a 5 year old – has a crystal ball when it comes to the stock market. But hey, if your daughter's portfolio continues to beat the S&P 500, I might just have to start taking investment advice from her too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 07:43:47'] children generally do better stock picking since the brands they're interested in typically are main-stream things all kids at that age like. since kids like it parents buy it and the companies do well. older people have developed their own tastes and also are typically "out-of-touch". also, if kids jump on something it normally does well. if they complain enough their parents will buy and if the parents have deep enough pockets they might sink in a lot of money to keep their kids happy. so, yeah, I would trust a kid to know what's hip and what to invest in
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:09:54'] Yeah... if you like the product other people might too. Good product is foundational to a solid profitable company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:30:25'] Wow OP this is a great idea for young kids. Absolutely love this. I’m sure they don’t quite fully understand what they are doing but it’s a great way for them to learn and invest at the same time. Not for nothing but I bet you here portfolio does well for a long time. She’s clearly picking the biggest and smartest companies out there! When I have kids I plan on copying this method
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 09:53:28'] Do you lead her to say a specific brand? Using your examples as my examples: "Can I buy YouTube stock?". Do you just go like "uuh sure" and buy GOOG, or do you kinda explain how it works to her? For cheese pizza, do you tell her she can't invest only in cheese pizza, and do you just buy the pizza stock you like the most?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 10:34:29'] AAPL is generally always a good buy. They just had a split so now is a good time to buy in lower than before. They have a lot of stuff coming up with Macs, health and fitness, augmented/virtual reality, gaming, and potentially the Apple Car and Apple Glasses that everyone mentions.

It's vaccine looks highly likely to be approved, but it's my impression the recent gains posted are taking that into account. But... who knows? The Novavax vaccine will be the first one to market distributed at refrigerated temperatures, which will make it hugely popular in the developing world where they don't have the infrastructure to move vaccines around at -40.

They also have a Uranium mining interest that they are spinning off into its own entity, so for the price, you're ultimately getting both Lithium and Uranium pure-plays. Price spiked up on its inclusion in the Nasdaq recently. I don't know if its a very long term hold yet, but I grabbed a few hundred shares as an informed bet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 16:42:39'] I just read the 2022 annual report for USLM- US lime and materials and one of the risks mentioned was  "We quote our lime and limestone products on a delivered price basis to certain customers, which requires us to estimate future delivery costs. Our actual delivery costs may exceed these estimates, which would reduce our profitability.  Delivery costs are impacted by the price of diesel. When diesel prices increase, we incur additional fuel surcharges from freight companies that cannot be passed on to our customers that have been quoted a delivered price. Material increases in the price of diesel could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s profitability."  I personally view this as a major concern.

I'm not sure that psychedelics will be shown to cure all of the ailments that the bulls claim it will, but if they hit on even a couple stage 3 trials for some of these mental illnesses, this could easily become a 10 bagger or more from its ~$1.80 price before a big pharma company buys them out.

I've came from literally nothing (no savings/stock/etc.) and lots of debt just a few years ago.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 09:53:51'] Whoop! Back in the green again! Feels good after almost a year of seeing red. Some of these run-ups are honestly a bit perplexing though. NVDA jumping up on seemingly little news? O doing great even though the real estate market is still shaky? I'll take it though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:03:27'] Well, I am happy and scared. Happy because I am up like 35k YTD ( I was down by almost 200k around Christmas). Scared because I can lose it all again if the fed turn hawkish next week or/and if Apple/Amazon/Goog have disappointing earnings....
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:11:40'] Any bears out there capitulating here? I'm as close to letting go as I've ever been. Seems different than August run-up. The only positive thing from a bearish perspective is that everything turned crazy bullish so quickly. As long as everyone was convinced bad Q1 it was never going to happen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:23:18'] Back to green on $NET after some dca-ing, valuation is still totally silly but glad to be buying down here not at $200 lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 13:07:02'] There are a few technical points on the SPY chart that make this a little different from the previous bear market rallies. The ‘golden cross’, SPY closing above the 200dma combined with actual economic good news (inflation, GDP, earnings so far being better than expected) - these all create momentum.Whether you believe in technical analysis is irrelevant - enough people do, including algos and market makers, that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:13:24'] How long you all have had Tesla shares? I think selling any other shares when in profit makes sense but doesn’t directly apply to Tesla. Would you really sell all your Tesla shares today if you are in profit of say 30%?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:15:34'] I'm a little confused by this, but what are the SEC laws on disclosing short positions when you are an influential investor? (Say Bill Ackman or Hindenburg Research)Say for example, you do some DD and discover some organization may be doing something really suspicious. (Using public information only, no insider info on company financials)Consider the following alternative approaches:1. You go social media and publicize your research. (The stock presumably falls) You *then* initiate a short position.2. You initiate a short position. You *then* go on social media and publicize your research. The stock falls and you take profit.3. You never publicize your research, but cryptically announce that you are taking a short position. Are all of those legal? Does it ever risk 'defamation'?Does your capacity to influence markets impact legality? If you're me, instead of Bill Ackman, market won't care. But clearly Ackman (Herbalife), Einhorn (Lehman), and other investors have run into hot water with the SEC related to their shorts. Was this just unfair targeting or were laws broken?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:23:31'] How the fuck did TSLA end up being my top performing lol. Picked it up at 110 and feeling good.Now can someone tell me why this was stupid? As in what made 110 price point an inflection? Because my DD was just it looks low?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:46:16'] Last time Powell and FED talked they said they want jobless claims to go up and don’t want market rally.Since then, jobless claims is lower than before and market is in a rally.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:58:05'] I really wish I bought more in Dec 2022. I did buy stocks but companies were doing a lot of holiday sales so I bought stuff like a new phone, clothes, computer, etc that was 30-50% off. When I should have instead went all in on the stocks that were on sale and 30-50% off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:00:22'] Saudi's will probably deny the deal now - I doubt they want to acquire something that went up so much in one day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 07:44:08'] I'm up 62% on NVIDIA, should I sell or hold?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:10:04'] If this holds it should be a pretty significant technical breakout
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 15:50:06'] I'm trying to figure out if now is the time to take some money off the table with growth stocks. Valuations have risen but at the same time, they are more attractive than some traditional/old-school companies with equivalent valuation multiples. Does anyone have any thoughts on if we will continue to see this rotation into tech or if the entire market will pull down from here?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 14:39:50'] LoL guys I've to tell you this one:  a couple of days ago I saw a guy writing in the Tesla investor sub that he was tired of waiting for the bottom, and that the P/E of Tesla was still high when it was at 100$.. he was pretty sure that there would have been a long way to go till the bottom.. he sold a huge amount of shares (I don't remember how many.. but more than thousand ) at 100$. Today I was checking the price and was like: "LoL"
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 16:05:14'] > GOLDMAN SACHS (Hatzius): All major economies (except the UK) now look likely to avoid recession this year.Wow what an insane claim! Would never have predicted that the UK is a major economy.I made a [comment all about the UK](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10iymjh/an_update_to_eurous_macro_situation_ft_eurozone/j5hm7zk/) a few weeks back.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:19:48'] I sold out of $PYPL.  I was fortunate enough to time the bottom and sold out for over a 20% gain for holding the stock for just a month. The bulls are getting too greedy here.  I might trim some other positions before close.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 05:32:05'] would not be suprised to see INTEL around 15/share by end of year. This thing is completely dead and unsalvageable. Intel is the new GE, the new Sears. Dumping all my shares at open (never had so much conviction to dump an entire position in a value stock before)

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:20:17'] In a win for Team Recession, the very first Atlanta Fed GDP Nowcast for Q1 2023 *real* GDP growth annualized is 0.7%! That's a *75% decrease in growth quarter over quarter* (I'm trolling here). Granted Q1 is still ongoing and the actual figure gets released April 27th.  Generally the estimate gets more accurate closer to the reporting date.In that time, we will get 2 more revisions to 2022 Q4 GDP, on February 23  and March 30th, that will tell us if the 2.9% that was achieved was accurate or not. The final Atlanta GDP estimate for Q4 was 0.6 percentage points (at 3.5%) higher than the realized first estimate. The *very* first Q4 estimate from the Atlanta Fed was 3.1 percent back on October 28th. Will this mean cooler inflation? Will unemployment go up? Find out in Season 2 of 2023!The landing just got a bit harder.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 09:13:45'] Tesla went up 70% in 14 trading days. This is purely hype. Tesla will go below 100. RemindMe! 6 months
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 09:18:17'] According to my personal inflation gauge (how many upvotes bulls on the /r/stocks daily are getting), we are no where close to taming inflation. And how can the job market be good if massage therapists from Google are getting fired? Has Mr. Powell's models and "eCONomists" taken into account the soft PP(I) data?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 08:35:38'] Our economist are so damn good now.  I think we’re heading into another golden age.  Innovation will quickly come back.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:05:35'] What are people thinking about Powell's speech next week?  Part of me is fearful because he may point to jobless claims going down as a reason to hold higher rates longer.  But part of me is hopeful because he might have to start admitting that a soft landing is becoming more probable.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 05:26:39'] This kind of cracked me up this morning: BERNSTEIN: : “We have written ..

But this time we REALLY mean it. .. the magnitude of the deterioration is stunning."Cuts target to $20. Underperform. $INTC
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 07:27:48'] I really don't know how to interpret this INTC collapse for AMD.  On one hand they are likely going to experience the same horrible consumer environment but on the other hand they are taking data center share, which Intel openly admitted.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:56:01'] Could somebody try to explain to me why someone would purchase shares of individual stocks instead of an ETF with large holding of the stock they’re interested in? For example, VOO or VTI instead of buying MSFT, AMZN or AAPL? Would you purchase individual stocks ONLY if you believe they will outperform the ETFs you’re looking at? I could purchase 3.5x more shares of AMZN than VOO, which would make 3.5x as much money as VOO if I held both for the same amount of time, assuming they magically increased the same amount in that time frame. Not that I’m planning on throwing all my money into one stock, I’m just trying to understand the mindset of buying individual stocks over an index fund or etf. Does the answer change depending on how much money you actually have to invest? Do you focus on lower price per share stocks/index funds when you have less cash to invest?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-20 15:54:48'] I just bought ARKF and PYPL last week.  I actually have more $ into ARKF because of the bucket of Fintech companies.  Actually PYPL is more than 3% of ARKF but I bought the PYPL first.  Holding both for the foreseable future.  I've owned AAPL for a while and it's gone a little sideways in the past 6 months.  It's my personal feeling though the numbers will be strong again for the next few quarters when they get their stores open fully and when the stimulus money arrives.  I think Apple does well for those 2 events.  Then I'll look at selling 10-20% of my shares.  If they turn in another dream Q like they just had and still go south, that may be sentiment, not execution.  Guy on CNBC talked about (I believe) Microsoft looking to possibly buy PINS.  He said they'll have to pay a LOT more than they originally thought.  I have no idea if that is already in the price.  It's very near an all time high, maybe on a big dip.  I recommend doing some DD into them being bought.

If you sell it, there is no telling if price will go further down and it is notoriously difficult to "time the market" when stocks are this volatile. Short term strategy: market is down, sell to cut your lossesLong term: get ready to buy on the rebound, the May low is the bottom threshold
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-21 02:47:11'] Seems like it may hit $100 this week (based off my basically my asshole). No reason to risk it. Apple is a consistently healthy company with no reason to believe there will be a long term down trend.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-21 08:38:28'] Apple rose because of the stock split and now it’s balancing out to pre-stock split news. To me, it’s stabilizing. I wouldn’t be shocked if it went down to $90. But for long term investors, it’s just another day. How fast are you trying to sell?

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-21 02:07:01'] 2 years ago the price of apple was 225 & i bought the top before they announced their earnings. It went down from that high to going as low as 140 I believe in a matter of 3 weeks. I pulled out my money on week 2 as the stock was going down because I needed the money & so took a 800 loss which was a lot for me at the time being new to the market. The stock did hit the 225 price after a year so chances are your money is going to be tied up for a year or so until you break even. My advice is if you don't mind waiting a year or 2 then do nothing, but get more seed cash to invest in other stocks or take your loss if it's a comfortable price you're willing to give up & invest in another stock as you surely recover from your loss quicker than holding AAPL depending on ypur experiece trading & investing.

Why should I trust a bot to use sources I trust? Why would I trust a bot not to be influenced by subtle sponcon? This stuff is solving for a problem most people aren’t asking, in my opinion. There are other uses for AI of course but I don’t think it’s going to revolutionize search the way they think.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 06:01:36'] These chatbots are a gimmick right now. Useful for certain things, but mostly a toy. As people become aware of their limitations, and how inaccurate they can be, the novelty will wear off. I think we are far away from this technology having a meaningful impact on these businesses.And although this might be naive of me, I have a very hard time believing a company like Alphabet wasn't fully aware of this as a potential threat to their business model. They've been working on AI themselves for years. Do you think nobody in the company thought, "Hey guys, if AI gets integrated into search, that could hurt our search business."My take on this whole thing? Alphabet hasn't been in any rush with AI because they know how complicated it is and they want to do it right. When they saw the release of ChatGPT and then Microsoft do their thing, they mistakenly rushed something out to show they're working on it too. It was more of a PR blunder than anything else. What they should have done was taken the high road by explaining the flaws in other companies' products, why it is such a complicated technology, and reassure their investors that what they eventually reveal will blow their minds.

There's really only two underlying search engines in the world.  Google makes one, Bing makes one.  Every other engine is based on either one.  Google represents a little over 90% of all searches.  So they're not going to get beat by better technology at this point.  In order for Chrome to become the most popular browser it required the US government to force Microsoft to give them their data and to not compete.I think BardAI's presentation not going well is going to mean Google isn't going to be able to "defend" against this.  The fact that BardAI in their presentation just gave false information is pretty bad.  I think people will be pretty excited to play with ChatGPT on Bing and I think it'll cause some people to permanently convert over to it.  I could see Bing being up to 20% of all searches in the next two years.I think the big thing with ChatGPT is that it's really really far ahead of the rest.  It's going to be incredibly useful in Microsoft Office (which is a major product for Microsoft).  I think Apple is honestly hooped.  They haven't really had a successful new product for a while and it'll be a few years of R&D before they'll be able come up with their next big seller.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 21:04:26'] So apple will have to either pay Google or Microsoft for their AI or build something from scratch.  In either case apple is losing money, so how is apple winning here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 22:52:47'] You are underestimating Google. They are sitting over treasure trove of data amassed from search and email and maps. In my opinion their data models will beat Chatgpt.Being late always does not mean lost.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 23:00:54'] Most of the internet is supported by ads. Not just Google, but most free websites that create content and host information make money through ads based on traffic to their website. If people get used to just reading a summary answer from a chatbot and stop actually visiting the website where the information comes from, then the website will go out of business. The these bots will eventually have no information to build off of to answer questions. That is not a good place for any search engine to be in.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 10:36:00'] I wind up using Bing a lot because it is used by the default Windows browser  at the bottom of the screen on PCs. I click on that browser out of habit and start searching.A couple of years ago, I would have to navigate to Google and search most of the time because the Bing search results were so bad. Lately the Bing results are almost if not as good as Google. Most of this is improvement in Bing although some of it is a decline in the quality of Google with its more obvious focus on advertising.I'm not saying MSFT will surpass Google in the near term, but I can see it significantly cutting into their market share. I'm long MSFT for this reason.

POST_TEXT: b"Been thinking of whether I should trim my apple or google positions and honestly...feeling kinda bearish on Google.\n\nGoogle has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).\n\n Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going"

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 12:45:35'] Apple. Just a better run company. They have incredible device sales, their services are great and quickly expanding, plus they are getting into AR, healthcare, wearables, etc... and they actually do their side projects well. Google Glass, Google+, etc were all massive failures... when Apple creates their "Apple Glasses" it will be the hottest new thing on the market, guaranteed. Not to mention they are almost double the size of GOOG in terms of market cap, and have insane amounts of cash to acquire whomever they may want and expand into other industries. Google will still do well, but Apple looks to be the superior company.edit: Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon also offer industry-leading support for the most part, while Facebook and Google have the absolute worst support of any large companies; another pro for Apple and con for Google
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 14:16:09'] Short Answer: If you want growth, it's Google and it's not even close.Long Answer:__APPLE__AAPL has low growth potential IMO and I see them as a future dividend aristocrat, not a growth company.AAPL sells expensive customer-hardware to a loyal customer base; that's it.  Their sales of computers have been stagnant for 10 yrs and smartphones have been for 5 yrs.  Moreover, phones are super competitive these days, they're lasting longer and phones have reached diminishing returns in terms of the tech they provide to customers.  They're way behind on services.  Moreover, they only focus on customer-facing services (no cloud).  Don't see them challenging, Netflix, Spotify, etc...  They better hope wearables or 5G is something people care about, it's their only realistic growth path.  That being said, AAPL is a fine company.  Their goal, IMO, was to get a loyal customer base, then extract as much $$$ out of them as possible.  Mission complete.  Growth will only come from a new gadget; something they haven't done since 2007.__GOOGLE__Google, on the other hand, does everything AAPL does. However, Google's potential is outside of consumer hardware. At their core, they're a digital marketing company.  Which makes sense. Between search and YouTube they have the majority of the eyes on the internet.  They also have all our data, i.e the most valuable asset in the world.  Moreover, unlike AAPL, they're actually trying to do something with all these goodies.Don't neglect Cloud, it's growing and making up more and more revenue a la Amazon and AWS.  Put simply, GOOG has tremendous growth potential.  They're trying to do many different things with a novel set of assets.  And if all their moonshots fail, they'll still have the eyeballs and data of the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 14:20:41'] Hard to say which has more growth opportunity, particularly in a time where Apple has more than doubled its market cap in 12 months, during COVID. I don't think you can go wrong with either.Google has its fingers in so many revenue streams, and clearly is ready to take on the future as AI/everything associated with it becomes more dominant.Apple is literally the best company in the US at marketing/getting people to buy its products. I can't imagine this will change in the foreseeable future. Unbelievable what it has consistently done in the phone, laptop, and headphone markets.Their business models are different, and they both dominate in their respective space, so it makes the comparison somewhat of an apples to oranges issue.If i had to bet solely on growth between the two, I would choose the company that has not gone up ~120% YTD as this can't possibly be sustainable for Apple. But who knows, maybe they will release iPhone 12 for $4,000 and everyone will buy one because suddenly their unbelievably powerful and well-built iPhone 11 is no longer sufficient.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 14:06:17'] Apple is a brand, and brands drive consumer spending. Google still does not know how to effectively and strategically market their products/releases, and until self-driving becomes the norm (really far out imo, I have a friend who works on self-driving cars) Google stock will barely beat index funds at best. With that said, unless you are not holding for the long-term, I'd still buy Google where possible. They have the best software engineers in the industry, and it's just a matter of time that they will either change their leadership (Pichai sucks) or boost their efforts in product marketing.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 13:42:37'] I think Google is too much at risk with global privacy concerns around data and outside of advertising (which is being hit hard longer term as people don't want to be advertised too) they are not the best at launching products.  The bigger question for me is what new markets can apple successfully enter with its cash pile ?
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 13:34:57'] You can't go wrong with any of these. They are still growing like crazy. Personally I think Facebook will outperform them all in the long term but that's just my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 13:19:14'] If this was a cage match, goog, they will fight dirty if need be
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 16:57:27'] GOOG.Look at apple news from a year ago and see how bearish people are for apple when it dipped to around 150 or so. I think those concern still holds true. We still have a slower smartphone replacement cycle, there is still trade war concern.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 12:30:43'] Google. Longterm they own the search engine idea and can expand beyond mere ad revenue. Apple will try to own the next big thing after they realized the smartphone, and Apple is pretty good in itself... very well run company, very protective of shareholders, very in contact with its consumers. But Google has barely tested its potential. I think Google will survive any trade war and any market boundary thrown at them and can expand into any sector they want eventually.The fact they test the waters is good. If they pull back from something they don't do that well in... then good.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-12 14:21:40'] GOOG. I just trust its longterm outlook more. AAPL is not quite as well diversified as I would like such a large company to be, and they largely depend on closed ecosystems and anti-consumer strategies that gradually push away consumers. They also aren't innovating nearly as much as they did back when Jobs was alive. GOOG, on the other hand, is extremely well diversified (arguably too much), owing to the extreme level of innovation. They also have a good track record with consumer relations, which supports the notion of them maintaining dominance as time passes.

With Google you get much more diverse revenue streams, much higher generation of new ideas, and based on their revenue growth you get better value than Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:41:59'] Understand that you're double/Triple dipping.$SPY contains all the stocks you've listed. So, you are weighting your portfolio towards tech. This is perfectly fine, as long as you understand it's what you're doing.ARKK is giving you TSLA exposure as well.Your portfolio is pretty correlated. i.e : $SPY goes up, most of the stocks go up. $SPY goes down - most of the stocks go down. Look into some defensive plays as well. Tech has outperformed in the last decade, but does not have to. I'd add a commodity / Precious metal etf to balance things out a bit.On a side note, I wish I had the financial sense to start at your age.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:46:06'] I’d recommend you liquidate right away - then:Keep 10% for investing in companies. Invest in only your top 3 ideas90% put it all in the Vanguard total market index fund (one holding)Over time contribute every month to both funds. Of monthly contributions: 90% monthly to vanguard and 10% to companies fund. Once you’ve read and gained experience and after you’ve been through 1) a big stock boom2) a huge crash/recession3) a period of extreme low volatilityThen you adjust your 90-10 breakdown, put more in stocks. But always invest in just your top 3 ideas. Why put money in your 4th best idea?Best of luckAlso - keep in mind when you read in the news that we’re “officially” (not likely or maybe) but officially in a recession - as in have gone through 2 quarters of negative GDP in the past! Then you double or triple contributions monthly. You make your fortune in recessions. 99% of people won’t have the mental fortitude and gut strength and foresight (keep cash and your job available) to do that. Be that 1% and do the above and you’ll make a fortune in no time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:44:44'] Good job.  I'd toss ARKK and substitute XSD or one of the other semiconductor ETFs.I'd also suggest having one share of XLK and QQQ to just compare your whole portfolio against.  QQQ could be a stand-in for META/GOOG/TSLA/AMZN/COST and XLK for AAPL/MSFT/NVDA/AMD.  Longterm it is a good idea to have an industry base ETF (like QQQ and XLK for "tech") and then go heavier with individual stocks.  You kinda do that by holding SPY, but it is a pretty small part of your portfolio at this point.Obviously you like tech, and so do I.  Having some diversity beyond tech, like KO, is good but don't worry too much about it until you have at least $xx,xxx in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:02:34'] ARKK is junk, imo. She's selling hype. Otherwise you're basically in big tech, plus KO, COST, and VZ. Why did you choose those?I'd imagine you could just buy QQQ and have similar results with less risk. Or just put it all in SPY, since you are basically buying the biggest parts of SPY. Also, VOO has a much lower expense ratio than SPY for essentially the same thing. You might want to review expense ratios.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:30:43'] Those are obviously fine companies.  The only criticism is that most are all very large cap technology companies.  The future growth may or may not be there.  For example AAPL is not going to increase by 32,000% or whatever again.  Same with AMZN.   It’s mathematically impossible.I’m a bit closer to retirement and would no doubt be happy with all of these in my portfolio.  Most are thru a large cap fund.   You may want to consider more in SPY or find some growth ETF’s.  I see ARKK but just hate Cathie she buys some duds.   Anyways, great job keep it up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:34:43'] My advice.  Get rid of all your stocks.  Just stick to your 80/20 VTI/ VXUS.  Invest each month into whatever is lagging to keep it 80/20 each month FOREVER.  That's it.  Then focus on what is more important to be rich.... Your education, job, income, savings, and LBYM.  Below is a link from JPM own private wealth arm concluding after looking at last 35 years of all individual stock returns they can't even suggest adding a concentrated portfolio to their OWN clients!  https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:27:22'] Not very diversified, is it? Not any criticism, but I would more diversify. Have you thought about some ETF's so spread is bigger? I just see a lot of tech and mainstream stocks!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:17:05'] Oh god ARKKOther picks look okay enough, but I’d do VOO over SPY
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:33:58'] TSLA & ARKK\- TSLY follows TSLA plus it provides monthly div\- OARK tracks ARKK ETF and has monthly div.If TSLA and ARKK turn south you still have div income, if they head north div is more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:21:08'] It's a lot of holdings. Large caps too. First, throw away ARKK, seriously. Then put whatever you want to keep low-risk in SPY, BRKB, VOO, VXUS or VTI, and try to add some risk to your portfolio. You're 19, find a company you like, understand (maybe in the field you're studying or working in today) and think is promising, then put some money you're willing to lose in it. Sell some covered calls for income if you like.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:56:03'] What you are doing is create your own ETF. There is nothing wrong with this strategy as long as you focus on those stocks and don’t expand them into a hundred, then you end up with a lot of little. Also I see some of your stocks pay dividends. Make sure you reinvest them. Finally, stay away from shady stocks like biopharma, they are very risky. You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term? It does pay great dividends but for the past several years has done nothing so although a stock like that may be good for an older investor looking for a steady dividend paying stock, at 19 it’s not a good thing, you don’t need dividends, you need growth. Also if you like a particular sector, get ETFs, and don’t shy away for an S&P ETF, or small caps, historically they have done well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 01:04:38'] Congratulations to you - I wish I had done this when I was 19!

My personal strategy is less diversification the better. Avoid dividend traps bc you’re young , no need for that. Find the brands you love and invest in them

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 07:13:16'] As someone who works in the tech industry, I’d invest in Apple every time. It’s a bit more expensive relative to some other popular picks, but it’s a great stock to own. You can never go wrong owning shares in a company that is becoming a utilities company for a society becoming reliant on a mobile OS to deliver goods, services, and social engagement products. I think people still view Apple as a consumer products company.. and although that’s their superpower now, that isn’t their ambition long term. There’s way more compute in your pocket than ever before, and the key for the next generation is more specific, context aware devices/capability that report back to a centralized OS. Apple is sitting on a goldmine of data that has yet to be utilized via on device processing. The end result is their native products become custom tailored to the end user, and with the ARM/macOS catalyst apps, it becomes much easier to propagate this data cross platform to serve more people in more places.There are clues of this everywhere if you look closely on how they’re thinking about this. It’s not just about services from a traditional subscription lens, but relevancy of data from multiple integrated sources (ie, CarPlay, Maps, watchOS, Apple Card) that can provide a more complete picture on exactly what your habits are on a more granular level (not just cookies) to serve you better and monetize better. You no longer have to be scrolling and tapping a screen to register your intent. It just learns as you go about your day in this new world of iOS.You can start to see some of this in iOS already in subtle ways.. for example, the category color in Maps are in sync with your spend categories in Card, which suggests that there’s a system to this madness that hasn’t come to fruition. Revenue is always a lagging indicator of success in tech. I’ve seen people be skeptical about Apple since I started following them in 2004. Most people understand the importance of services at face value but I don’t think they understand just how much more runway there is to go. Their cash cow has grown up, but they’ve given developers the raw materials to grow the ecosystem.. a lot of these flowers have yet to bloom.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 10:38:21'] A lot of people in this thread are all talking about Apple like they only make phones.  The same as everyone talks about Tesla as a car company.  People fucking love Apple.  You might not. Reddit might not.  But there's a reason they are crushing it.  It's simple, elegant, and a lifestyle brand to boot.  Apple in the future?  They aren't going anywhere any time soon.  I own it.  But I'm considering ditching it and replacing it with an ETF that holds it.  I have little faith in any company that makes phones to do anything innovative enough to break out or go crazy any time soon.  Still using an iPhone 7 I bought in I think 2015.  Works fine. Does what I need it to do.  Won't upgrade till forced.  It's a good phone. Does what I need it to.  It's simple.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 05:42:54'] To me, they have gotten a little stale. I know that might be kind of shortsighted; but after the iPhone they have what, exactly?My friend bought a boatload of it 10+ years ago. I am jealous of that buy.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 02:44:20'] People underestimate the power of consumerism.Yeah 1,000+ is a lot to pay for a phone. But with a monthly payment plan, people can justify those prices.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 02:16:22'] I generally dont like there products, and they are in a oversaturated market, with Samsung growing and more phone companies reinventing themselves like razor and Nokia off of nostalgia. Their phones are repetitive small upgrades every year and this also relates to most of their other products and they are also spreading themselves thin, eventually brand name alone wont save them anymore and people wont buy their products. One of my professors mentioned that a company will die when their product range (not sure if this is the correct term) is passed the point of being innovative. They have no where else to go in my opinion besides upgrading the same old thing and latching onto the next big thing like wireless headphones right now. This is the view of an inexperienced trader and college student, I know I have much to learn, i just dont feel like the very small amount of money I do have would be best invested mainly into aapl, rather than a bunch of other companies that I find have more room for growth and are making waves with competition or are just reliable in the long run.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 02:03:41'] I don't hold Apple because I only do options, and their contracts are overpriced and not worth the price for the gains you could get. I only do monthlies so go look at the prices. Ties up more capital than other plays. Same with TSLA, SHOP, etc.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 08:04:38'] I regret not buying more Apple stock before this pandemic (it was almost $200 or so a share and now it's $366 a share at this moment). I'm a Samsung user but sometimes I'm tempted to get an Iphone because their camera is far better.And yes while they do rely on their sales of Iphones, I feel like plenty of college students still buy their MacBooks, they released a cheaper Iphone, and Airpods are still very popular.Also, don't underestimate how dumb consumers can be; even if they can't afford it, people will still buy the Iphone, but just pay it off monthly as opposed to upfront. I feel like even during this pandemic people are still willing to get the newer models of Iphone, as opposed to switching over to Samsung.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 08:33:30'] because tim cook isn't steve jobs.the company hasn't been innovative in a long time, their mobile marketshare is decaying, and they just announced they are moving away from x86-64 processors in their desktops/laptops.combine this with the current valuation, and it seems far more likely to lose over the long term than gain. at $200/share, it was a reasonable consideration. at $366/share? no thanks. i'd take almost 2 shares of ms over 1 share of apple any day of the week.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 09:46:27'] If you ask about TSLA and SHOP, those have much more room to grow I guess as compared to AAPL (whether they are overvalued companies is another question altogether). Why people don’t like AAPL nowadays might be because mostly they don’t seem to innovate very much (in my opinion) anymore, just more of improving on what they’ve already created with the OG iPhone. And because of that I guess their prospects may not be as great as it used to be. This doesn’t mean that AAPL won’t be a great investment, but it might be worth looking for others that might be even better. But yea AAPL for the next 2-5 years, shouldn’t be an issue.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 09:56:43'] There was always the question how long Apple can milk what Steve Jobs has left behind. Apparently over a decade. But there is always the idea in mind that Apple will eventually end up like Nokia though with more safety due to the number of branches Apple has

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 10:46:42'] I would not buy them at this point. There are other companies to buy like fsly and net. However, I hold aapl since 2007 and it treats me well. Look for a growing company instead a blue chip which probably in most of ETFs.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 12:32:24'] I am one who will never buy Apple. I think it's a brilliant company and will keep on doing well. However, imo their products are ridiculously expensive and it will get to the point when people start getting fed up of paying for the brand name.Their earlier products were market leaders but now I think firms such as Samsung have closed that gap considerably. I switched to Galaxy from iPhone a few years back and haven't changed since.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 13:29:02'] Samsung users.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 13:38:31'] I don’t know honestly. They’re dominating lifestyle tech products in the US, and are very good at building a loyal user base. They also have tons of cash that can be used to buyback shares, payout dividends, or expand their company. The iPhone has been the same thing for years, so have all phones.It’s not a fun growth company. The risk/reward isn’t exciting. But they are king of consumer tech.People looked a supply and demand curve and think Apple is going to stop selling products because they are expensive.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 14:29:34'] To me, Apple is a grandpa stock. 1. The cost per share is too high for anyone not having life savings to invest.2. It will guarantee go up due to buybacks but maybe 20% in months of dilly dallying.3. You could make much more money investing it in other stocks that are slightly more risky.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 05:06:58'] I understand every facet of apple's business but can't comprehend how they actually sell anything because of that understanding. Don't invest in what you don't know.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 05:10:51'] I want to buy AAPL stock, but I can't possibly justify it today for multiple reasons:* Apple's PE Ratio & Forward PE are at historic record highs, which is frankly absurd given today's economy.* Apple's high prices make them more of a luxury item that people are more likely to cut in difficult times, and times could become very difficult compared to now very fast once the last round of government stimulus runs out.* I don't believe Apple still has the high growth prospects the stock is priced at. I think other companies you list like TSLA, SHOP, GOOG, & FB all have much more obvious prospects for massive growth then Apple.* AAPL's reliance on a single part of their business (iPhones) makes the risk of a collapse in value overtime more likely than other big tech companies, most of whom tend to be more diversified. This makes it harder for me to justify paying a huge premium for Apple at today's prices.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-01 08:09:15'] I initially avoided investing in Apple because I feel that they stopped being innovative after Steve Jobs passed away.But I now started investing in them since I realize that even though they are not as innovative as they used to be, they are still a very well run company with an incredibly powerful brand and a huge moat around their business that is unlikely to go away any time soon.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 09:33:29'] Don’t sell right now.... AAPL has had great potential for long term growth for years and it’s only going to continue. Remember, buy low and sell high.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 09:35:10'] Think of why you first bought AAPL. & if the reason still makes sense today then don’t sell. If it’s because of fundamentals then nothing has changed.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 09:56:23'] cut back some and diversify a bit (because 40% in one stock is way too much, my target is typically no more than 20% in any one stock), BUT it probably makes sense to wait a week or two and see if you can get a price spike. selling immediately after multiple red days is NOT ideal timing. you should easily be able to pull out an extra $10-$15/share over the current price of 120 with some patience.as far as tech receding goes, that's not a long term issue. long term tech will be fine and most tech companies will be worth more in a year than they are currently.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 09:39:21'] Definitely seems like too much weight in your portfolio. I’d trim at least half but if it were me I’d try to wait until it comes back to 130. I doubt it’s making it back to ATH any time soon but 125-130 seems reasonable in the next few weeks.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 09:58:40'] Apple is a solid bet to see continued growth. We are use to seeing heavy green, but every stock corrects. I’d be worried if it continued to trend upwards for so long without some correction/profit take. Just hold on to AAPL, that should have been why you bought it. Take some off the top when you need but don’t panic sell just from last week.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 10:38:00'] 40% is too much in my opinion. I won’t go above 20%, unless I think the company is truly undervalued, in which case I might let it ride to 30%, but more then that is in too much risk in a single stock for my taste.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 11:24:27'] If I already owned aapl I'd still want to own aapl so If I were you I wouldn't sell all of it. I think Apple is a great company but I certainly wouldnt want anything to be 40% of my portfolio as a long term investment. Honestly, I would probably sell 75-90% and bring it down to 5-10% of my portfolio. I would also sell off my higher priced shares if I was gong to sell instead of letting the computer pick and default to first-in first out, likely selling off my lower priced shares. I would sell a portion, take some profits, keep my lowest cost shares long term and either reinvest and diversify or short term hold some cash until I had a plan for what to do with the money long term. I think things are going to be volitile into the end of the year with the election, the massive run up we've had since march and the economy. Holding some cash near term would let you buy into some good deals if any pop up.I gambled and dumped 60% of my portfolio into Tesla after the split was announced and theyd run up like 600% in a year (from 200ish to the 1400s)I cashed out all 150 shares, then later bought back 25.  I probably should have waited as the S&P announcement came out and then it fell again. It's a stock I want to own. I played the split as a trade and it worked out as expected. I made a calculated bet and the bet paid off- Thankfully, I got a little lucky.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 11:40:55'] Good company, with unspectacular growth, that has gotten very overvalued.It's got a great balance sheet, but it also gained 80% on it's stock price in 9 months.  That's utterly insane from the world's biggest company, especially since revenue growth in Q1 was 0.5%.  Apple is exciting, and has been on a terrific run for the past 15 years, but I think there is going to be way better companies for growth for awhile.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 11:45:07'] A lot depends on how long you've been sitting on the lots of the position.I've been building my AAPL position for a little over two years now, and if I liquidated at Friday's closing price, I'd owe about $14 per share in taxes, on average. That means (disregarding future tax liability reduction) the share price has to drop another $14 per share for me to break even, buying back in later. For me, it makes very little sense to sell any shares.The critical numbers will likely be much different for folks who have held their positions for short durations.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 11:54:16'] 4 years of estimated earnings growth discounted to today would valued AAPL at $1.99T today, but I'm estimating earnings growth to not include growth in India due to their low wages. I might be undervaluing AAPL.AMZN, on the other hand, should be valued at $2.15T.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 12:34:20'] I would never sell aapl unless I need the money. I have about 36% in my portfolio and nothing grow as much as that in long term. Just my two cents.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 12:37:33'] Much of my apples stocks managed by a 3rd party has been sold through out 2020. They started buying insurance stocks on my behalf. When there is an over-valuation concern they take gain use insurance as cushion.  I hold just enough Apple to stay balanced. My opinion on Google is similar.  Neither is cheap even after glitches.I am building portfolio for plan B if it arrives.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 13:02:12'] I trimmed some AAPL shares before the split and put the proceeds into Facebook and Shopify. Those two have more runway left and will double in share price quicker than AAPL.  Still have a big position in AAPL, although.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 14:10:51'] What’s in your other 60%?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 15:02:34'] Apples average PE is close to 18 and its double that at 37 now.  This might make sense if they had some brand new lucrative revenue streams, but they really dont.  Not saying they cant increase revenue, just not enough to warrant their PE being double the all time average.Apple is a great company and I have nothing against holding them long term, but holding 40% right now seems very risky given its current valuation.  How comfortable/uncomfortable are you with them dropping 50%?  Dont think this will happen but it could happen.  I think its a good time to cut back and diversify a bit given how far theyve run in recent months. This also depends in how much you have in Apple.  If its a few thousand and you wanna let it ride, then go for it.  If its 40k then I would more strongly suggest diversifying.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 16:44:07'] I advised my friends who are into AAPL to consider selling in February as I was expecting a drop following Corona news.I was wrong Apple has gone up and it will probably still go up.I don't understand why because iOS share has downward trend, iPhone share has downward trend and once they drop below 10% developers will no longer prioritize them (worse experience), their "services" and Music are not taking off. Mac has sucked, now it's kinda OK but there will be a shakeup with switch to Arm (once dust settles it will probably be OK, though it will loose people who dual boot or only install Windows because Mac looks good in the lobby).TLDR: AAPL only goes up despite fundamentals.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-14 18:00:31'] yeah but how many choices did you have in 1985? if you had 200 different tech stocks to choose from it's pretty hard to pick the handful of winners.>The total market would be netted you $15k over those 35 years with the same 1000 investment.okay but realistically, if you have a bunch of people picking 15 stocks to put 1k in and holding them for 35 years are they going to beat the index fund on average?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-14 18:42:14'] In the 1980s you needed enough money to actually bother having a broker to make that trade for you. If you could do this you were already pretty wealthy.Besides, you could get 8% just putting your money in a money market or a CD.

I think I would buy if it < 100 billion market cap, but where is the avenue to raise fcf without raising subscription prices?Does anyone know how much more money they will make if they go after password sharing?Advertising was a good move imo by Netflix.  They should set up merchandising and make a serious bid into gaming.  I think it would be cool if Netflix had a tv remote that could turn into a gaming controller.  The games don't have to be complicated - simple indie games so that parents can pass the buck and raise their kids on Nflx.  They are also the only steaming service that actually makes money - indicating streaming is hard and maybe making it a good moat.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 13:04:56'] Today I bought a random mixture of stocks/ETFs:2 shares of AVDV (ex-US small cap value), 1 share of AVUV (US small cap value), 5 shares of PSCE (small cap oil), 5 more shares of BTU (US thermal/seaborne thermal/seaborne met coal), and a little bit to my Retirement Fund.I had just opened my BTU position recently and am slightly up 3%, so am adding while i can. There is a major catalyst coming up in the next few weeks which could see huge upside (debt covenants getting released --> shareholder returns). And downside if management does something stupid.I had also bought AMR (met coal) recently and am already up some 12% so reluctant to keep on adding. Coal Twitter seems to be taking profits on AMR although noting it is still relatively cheap.I'll make a post about coal, but basically the bull thesis for the next few years isn't that prices are going to be absurdly high like earlier this year, but that the 'new low' is a lot higher. If you look at forward curves for thermal or met coal pricing into 2023/2024, they are still very high. Given that these coal companies are priced cheaply even at those prices, they are a pretty good deal, although not the multi-baggers they once were.As a side note, hang out on Twitter and check out the Spaces. You can get some fantastic DD from people in the industry or major investors talking about their bull or bear cases. For example, yesterday I was listening to a guy in Australia talking about the shortages of coal thanks to floods.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 04:34:56'] Looking at WAL-western alliance bank. Regional bank based in Arizona. They're currently trading at 6.7x earnings, and are forecast to grow earnings 10% per year for the next few years. Similarly growing regionals trade at 10x earnings or more. Potentially a 60% upside if the multiple corrects to that level. Any thoughts?

But when doing my taxes online, the amount of money that is expected for my refund when down exactly equal to the amount of money I made on Tbills. Is that correct or is something wrong?E.g. if I was expecting a 500 dollar refund, when I entered that I made 100 dollars in interest from Tbills my refund decreased to 400 dollars.Are Tbills not tax efficient for those of us who would usually be receiving some amount of refund?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 11:52:54'] So much of this question contradicts itself. If you want “max returns” you go with something risky. But then your friend might come out of jail with a lot less money 5 years later.A single stock like aapl or msft would be a much safer bet while still capturing the chance of greater upside. Still risky though and could be less in 5 years.S&P 500 would not get you max returns, but would be the most likely to come out on top in 5 years.Otherwise do some research and pick your favorite {insert hyped industry} stock

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-03 08:10:18'] apple doesn't even need half that time span to get back to 120.in october you're almost certain to see not only a new round of iphones, but also a stimulus deal finally being reached. on top of that, you're also going to have trump's inevitable recovery in a week or two.
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-03 10:45:14'] Possible? Of course. The question, especially with options, is what are the odds of it doing so?The greater the chance, as calculated by the market, the more you had to pay for that option. So you already decided that the options market was wrong, the the chance was better than expected that the stock would make it to $120. Because you “believed” this, you paid a premium for that option.  Meanwhile, you’re losing time value, extrinsic value, everyday (I hate that position!). If you are so confident that a stock will go up, maybe you should be selling puts?

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-03 08:04:36'] Absolutely. Why? Apple is the only big tech company not under political scrutiny, and has been the safe place to store wealth in a covid upswing. The rapid early morning sell off was weak hands at work, trying to influence others to sell.  It reaches 115 yesterday as a high. We have a full three weeks of news, a trump recovery, and narrative breakdown, which should create confidence in the market. My wild ass guess is it will high at 124.50/125 by the 30th (at least twice).
	COMMENT: ['2020-10-02 19:23:54'] First. Everyone needs a serious hand here. 1. Market dropped because of failed stimulus deal with republicans2. Bad job numbers3. Trump being  ignorant and not wearing a mask. Any questions? Two, no. We are on a downtrend on weekly and daily.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 14:19:49'] I feel you man it’s really hard to tell what will happen before the split and after. I also get the notion that a buy now is more or less a “discount” for when the split comes. But I’m 100% about buying during the split. It is totally a “FOREVER” and ever hold and I don’t think it’s a bad investment at any price tag, steadily growing and almost guaranteed quarterly dividends.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 07:17:49'] I believe Apple has so much more to offer as well. I remember reading about their work on self driving cars and Apple glass (eye glasses). Also, genius to stock split to make it affordable for everyone every so often. Apple can’t be stopped.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 22:16:10'] IMO I think it will keep rising until the split. For some reason people love a stock split eventhough there are fractional shares now. However I'd be cautious as the stock is considered overvalued and the split could be a reason there is selloff and profit taking, but if you believe in the company long-term then it doesn't really matter when you get in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 01:19:42'] Look it's quite simple.If you bought 10 years ago, would you sell now?No -> then buy nowYes -> then don't buy now
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 08:10:49'] So this stock split is not gonna help anyone because the price is gonna go beyond $500-600 dollars. Anyone thinking they will get apple for $100-125 you are dreaming! The price is gonna go up during August and this 4:1 split isn’t gonna be great for those that are poor
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-08 11:17:04'] I’m considering selling some after holding for a few years but it’s a timing thing. I’d want to get back in as in my mind I would expect Apple to take a haircut it’s a great company but this most recent run seems a little extreme.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-07 14:46:36'] I never understood the point of forever holding. Do people have a fetish of taking maximum amount of shares to their graves with them? Is this some sort of Pharaoh fantasy?  Die with maximum accumulation of wealth?

POST_TEXT: b"Hello internet, here's a little context to my request. If you want to get to the meat and potatoes of the request, skip this paragraph. I am a young lad who's getting a grip on his finances. I've decided to start investing, but my young age has me, well, inexperienced. I was planning on opening an brokerage account when I turned 18, but covid had majorly impacted my financial situation from what I had foreseen it to be. So, half a year later, here I am, motivated to start by the GME short squeeze. Having taken a (shortened) semester in highschool where I learned a little about stocks and investments, I've decided that since I'm young and not financially independent to invest in stocks I have a strong feeling are going to grow continually over the years. One of my first thoughts was Amazon, and so with the $20 I had before getting a job I invested about $10 of it into Amazon. \nThat investment has since flopped, because as soon as I made the investment, Bezos decided to step down as CEO."

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:00:40'] I'm an AMZN holder, and I believe Jassy will be a good CEO (maybe better than Bezos, since Jassy made the only profitable part of the company). One possibility to consider is that Bezos is leaving because he wants to work on other projects. For those projects, he'll need lots and lots of money. Where is his money? AMZN stock. So he might be selling his shares, thus depressing the price. Bill Gates did the same thing when he left MSFT, and ended up with fewer shares than Steve Ballmer. It's natural for AMZN to be horizontal for a while--it had an enormous run-up in 2020, then the news of Bezos leaving, and now a broad market sell-off due to treasury yield fears (which hurts growth companies like AMZN in particular). Personally, I think AMZN is amazingly undervalued right now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:29:00'] That’s a lot of writing
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:10:13'] The drop in AMZN has nothing to do with the new CEO and everything to do with the overall dip in the markets, particularly tech stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:28:39'] You’re assuming a lot by thinking the decline is due to the CEO announcement.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 21:35:42'] Worked at AWS for five years and sat in meetings with Jassy. Jeff wouldn’t of given him the company reigns if he wasn’t certain he could do it. Jassy is brilliant and can do the job, his style is a little different than Jeff’s but I don’t think outsiders know how pervasive Amazon culture is steeped in the company. There will be a steep learning curve and will take him a few years to learn the rest of the business but he will have Jeff looking over his shoulder. The recent dip has very little to do with the CEO change and more has to do with the macro environment. There is some belief that AMZN will dip as we reopen the economy. They’re also tied up in some of the high growth tech stock rotation.Amazon is a tricky one to value. It is one of the few stocks I don’t like to use a PE for just because there isn’t a great historical value and it is a slow and steady come-down over decades. They also are unstable in how much they reinvest back into the company, basically if they see something to their liking they give zero fucks about pouring money into it.I like price to free cash flow instead which tends to range from 40-80. Right now it is at 54 which isn’t terrible but isn’t a steal either. That said, the great thing about Amazon is it is growing so fast so if the price stays constant you’ll be in the 40’s by the end of the year.I would buy but would not be surprised with a 30% hit if it gets thrown out with the bath water if there is a QQQ crash. Long term this is a decade buy and hold stock. One of only three I subscribe that to: BAM, BRK, AMZN.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 20:43:23'] basically I'm inexperienced and would like some pointers from a more experienced investor on how my thinking/ideology could be improved and also some clarification for confusion I have regarding $AAPL's lack of a dip when Tim Cook took over as CEO.

I am researching thoroughly what stocks are realistically smart both long term and short term but am quite curious with Apple.

Even google is 10x higher. Does it have to do with number of stocks available? Or the fact they just launched new tech (M1 chip) last year and likely wont have a big release soon? It does look like Apple has had relatively steady growth over the past 2 years.\n\nEdit: mentioned GME and decided to take that out.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:09:02'] Market cap = stock price x shares outstanding.Stock price alone doesnt show anything about a company's value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:10:50'] they split their stock last year. the stock was $500 before it split in 2020. it was also their 5th split in the company’s history. according to this article, each AAPL share would be worth $28k today if it never split:https://www.google.com/amp/s/markets.businessinsider.com/amp/news/apple-stock-split-shares-performed-year-after-previous-historical-returns-2020-8-1029548855the stock price isn’t everything, look how high their market cap is
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:10:29'] Apple has also split their shares multiple times over the years. Before the last split it was around $425 a share if I remember correctly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:09:54'] Look at market cap and not individual share price. Companies don’t all have the same number of outstanding shares, individual share price doesn’t tell you much of anything about a company’s total value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:09:36'] You will want to check out Apples market capitalization rather than their stock price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:13:28'] Just a heads up, but we generally don't need background on things like GME before talking about a totally unrelated topic.   >Why is Apple at ~$135 a stock when other big retail companies like their biggest competitor Samsung are WAY higher.Stock price is mostly just reflection of the number of shares outstanding and the value of the company.   Let's say you have a company worth  $100, and there are 100 shares.   Each share should be worth a dollar.   Let's say that company does a 1 to 2 stock split.   Now the company consist of 200 shares, and each share is worth 50 cents.  In that example the value of the company never changed, only the share price.   This is why comparing the cost of the share of different companies is rather pointless.   Stock splits are exactly why Apple's shares are $135 and not some outrageously higher number.   They've split the stock several times over the years, and recently within the past year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:10:02'] I believe it’s because they split their stock. When it reaches a certain value per share, they split that stock a person owns into 4 individual stocks. This makes it so more people will buy stocks since it’s cheaper
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:10:45'] Stock price doesn’t mean anything in relation to value. Price to sales could be good to check. Google 7.6 p/sApple 7.7 p/sSo essentially they are equally priced in terms of revenue.Edit: Market cap divided by revenue = price to sales ratio
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:13:32'] Yahoo finance will also tell you the Market Cap without  having to calculate it yourself. I’m sure there are also other stock tracking apps that will as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:25:57'] My manager at Apple told me back in 2009 that he had over $100K in AAPL stock. It has split twice since then. Back then, AAPL was about $12/share and if you were an employee I think you got it at $6/share. Buying that stock was hands down the smartest thing I ever did and I’m retarded.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 11:36:43'] it has to do with number of sticks issued.

POST_TEXT: b"Good morning sun, good morning trees, good morning Apple...which is reportedly planning a new ad-free podcasting subscription service. \n\nRight now, podcasts are an admans game: Spotify and other top companies in the space, like Amazon and SiriusXM, spent the past few years swallow[ing] up podcasting production firms in an effort to gain more control of the podcast ad market, per The Information. \n\nThink: Stitcher, The Ringer, etc. \n\nCome back later: It could be bad timing for Spotify, which recently saw shares decline after analysts at Citi downgraded its stock because Spotify hasnt shown any material benefitfrom its $800 million-plus investment in podcasting content and tech, per Variety. \n\nAnd, in theory, a major subscription service has the potential to yield more money for creators than the ads keeping them afloat now. \n\nWhy it matters: This isn't the first ad-free subscription podcasting service, but Apple's deep pockets give it a better shot at disruption than smaller up"
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-20 18:02:51'] When they say "ad free", is that just "free of ads from the distributor" or "free of ads from the content author"?I have Spotify Premium, but pretty much every podcast makes its own advertisements within the recording, so paying for Premium is pretty useless in the podcasting realm.Now, if they were to edit the recordings on this service so that I never had to listen to a podcaster advertise Bombas socks in the middle of a story about a spree killer in Victorian London ever again, I might be interested in that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 05:56:04'] No one knows how the day is going to trade, but some the predictions/commentators here can be so dramatic/funny. Here’s two of my favorites from yesterday near the close: > Good Non farm Payroll numbers  tomorrow = Fed tightening not working as there are enough job openings = Stocks go down> Bad Non farm Payroll numbers = Recession coming = Stocks go down> Feds and algos/suits are hands in glove and they want you to lose your job amd have stock losses so you spend less money. Nothing else matters.…> Huge selling pressure in the last 30 minutes. Guess the suits got an early peak at tomorrow job data

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 18:25:53'] Lol there's a video on youtube on November 2018 of Mike Wilson saying not to buy the dip and the sp500 was at 2700 or so.Then he goes on to say " blah blah blah ... next year earnings aren't gonna be great". Then he's on cnbc again in January 2018 saying it's not safe to buy stocks yet. Meanwhile the market rallies all of 2019 to over 3200.Then he's on again in June 2019 saying "market might pull back 10% now..... meanwhile market rallies all the rest of 2019.Meanwhile .... 4 years later ....I'm not listening to these guys anymore... lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 07:39:37'] I said right at the market trough today that the dip would get bought up. The most important thing, by far, was/is that wage growth was below expectations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 06:09:49'] So more jobs created, but the pay is shitter. I think this means more people are working than before and this gives the employers more leverage and thus shitter pay increase. But I don't know if fed will pivot base on this data because more jobs = more inflationary pressure. Only rise in unemployment would means lower inflation.Not sure why the market is happy though
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 03:38:00'] Euro Zone YoY CPI is 9,2%, under the 9,7% expected (10,1% previously).MoM is -0,3%, vs 0,8 expected.Today is non farm payroll. It will probably be good (or not good from FED point of view, I don’t know since FeD seems like she doesn’t even know what to do too)As a non American, I’m curious, is it always like that the FED talk so openly ? The FED unanimously and openly saying she wants people to lose their jobs and market to tank is quite unbelievable from an Euro point of view.

My wife and I each contribute $6k/yr to it, as it's a Roth IRA.\n\nI have no income (disabled) but my wife and I do have $75k in savings, and my wife makes $110k/yr, so it's not like we're poor. However, my medical bills are substantial, so we want to be smart with our money (which is why we've stuck to VTSAX mutual fund).\n\nMy question is this... should we maintain our mutual funds with VTSAX and open a separate investor's account? I AAPL is going to pop and is a great long-term investment, but have no idea how much to invest. Advice appreciated."

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 11:51:51'] Get them something relevant to their lives, and that pays a dividend. Assuming this isn't a full blown portfolio geared to paying for college or whatever, and more just introducing them to the concepts of investing. It's much easier for kids to grasp the idea of getting paid to own parts of companies. And they can see tangible, albeit small, returns quarter over quarter, which will help reinforce the idea of long term compounding. Focusing on pure growth may be a great way to discourage them as they enter this potential recession and see constant declines QoQ, YoY. As they mature, they can explore ideas of growth, reading income statements, sector analysis, small cap vs large cap, foreign and emerging markets, and everything that goes with that. But start with the absolute bare basics and build from there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 12:43:04'] I would let them pick some. Kids are intuitive and they know what they like. If they like a company, chances are they understand (at a beautifully simple level) what’s great about the company. For instance, MCD, “It’s tasty and the happy meal has a toy!”
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 11:51:10'] If investing in their favorite hobby stocks doesnt motivate them, try to find stocks that give out free stuff annually. Dont know if any of them do it anymore, but I use to have Wrigley stock when I was a wee tyke. Every Xmas, Id get a big box of free gum that took me a year to finish. That was pretty cool for a little kid imo.Some good hobby stocks are videogame makers (check to see they arent scumbags first *cough*atvi*cough*), sports apparel, toymakers, favorite junk food, Space related,  etc. All will need DD before jumping in, but I'm sure you can find a few that spark some interest.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 15:10:47'] Nintendo might be a good choice, and you are right about Disney as well. Two companies loaded with impenetrable IPs. There is also Take Two Interactive (Grand Theft Auto, Read Dead Redemption, NBA 2K) although Take Two can be somewhat cyclical because as you may know, they don't release major games in RDR or GTA series very often.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 15:58:55'] The ones that go up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 17:13:42'] A regular dividend is sure to spark investing interest in adults at least so I guess it could do the same for kids.Even if the total return is lower a dividend-paying stock may make it psychologically easier to hold a stock long-term while making it more fun.But if they are kids maybe introduce them to games with compounding to try to get them to fully understand the power of reinvesting. Here's a [list of some games.](https://chooseinvesting.com/blog/investing-games-list/)It doesn't necessarily have to be about investing but just that you can compound anything.Since when they get introduced to stocks/indexing they may actually understand what compounding can do for them. And if the only compounding they do are in stocks/investing it may be too boring and they won't know what compounding actually can do.And when the time comes for investing in stocks they may know how op it is, just as it is in those games they used to play.This isn't any advice just suggestions, I have no teaching kids experience.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 12:32:20'] Prob an unpopular opinion, but maybe let your kids grow up before they get into the *riveting* world of stocks and finance in general. I feel like it ages them and kids already grow up so fast nowadays. Let them be young, and they can learn about financial literacy when they get their first job, then you can grant them that nest egg you’ve been saving for them since they were born.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 12:01:55'] I’m thinking also today’s kids (of Jr High age) know technology. Stocks in the tech sector (blue-chip stocks) could be of interest. If you got kids who like cars (EV) stocks like Ford, Tesla. Invest in what they know and use is a good place to start. My take.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 18:08:00'] None.  Sorry, but the WORST thing is making investing fun.  Investing should be like paying for your mortgage.  Something you do every month because it is a responsibility.  Nothing you feel strongly about either way.  Then 30 years later you realize you get a whole bunch of adv. from having that equity in the house.Making investing fun makes it feel like a game.  That is how you have the culture of these Reddit forums and why so many TBH SUCK at investing and end up poor in their 50-60's.  If you have read the Tortoise and the Hare investing is akin to being the Tortoise.  NO ONE wants to be the tortoise, but that is what you want to be....Focus on:  Saving, LBYM, not being materialistic, not caring what others have/ wearing, working hard to buy stuff on your own, getting a great education.  Then when they are older... index investing EACH and every month in an asset allocation that makes sense to them.  They LITERALLY don't even need to understand anything about what a stock even mean to be worth millions in their 50's if they just do the above.  Or they could do LOVE stocks and be poor in their 50's.  Funny how that works.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 13:27:49'] You want kids to be interested in stocks, you should pick a meme stock. Not necessarily to trade in, but observe how social media, financial media, mix of questionable and solid company turnaround plans all intersect. I count bank stocks as meme stocks too now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 11:55:45'] Roblox, netflix, spotify, snap, uber/lyft, starbucks, pinterest. Stuff like that would probably interest them. Idk how many are investable right now lol. I like spotify the best out of the bunch.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 16:22:35'] Something active.  Responsible is great and all but it’s boring.  If you want the responsibility aspect you can split it do some responsible choices and some meme stocks do they have something to check/trade regularly and actually see value change. Then at the end of the year see which choice was more profitable.  Also the answer is always TSLA

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 22:38:07'] What are they into? Depending on their interests you may be able to find a relevant stock. For example, a kid who loved Harry Potter might want to buy Scholastic Corporation (SCHL) which has the US publishing rights. An athletic kid might want to buy NKE or DKS. WWE is publicly traded if they’re into that. Hasbro (HAS) might be worth a look depending on interests.Also think about their favorite foods & drinks. Coca Cola (KO) and YUM could make sense for fans of their products.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 23:20:45'] Apple, MCD, SBUX, MSFT, V, GOOGL, Nike, Amazon.  Something they use or see on a regular basis.  If they see something popular at school, see if they can find out who makes it and then purchase stock in that company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:47:29'] Peter Lynch writes about kids getting interested in stocks in One Up on Wall Street, one of his two books from the 1990sHis advice is to start with stocks for companies the kids are familiar with and they already like the product or service. e.g., Supermarkets where the family buys food; car companies that make the family's vehicles or oil company stocks if they're familiar with the Exxon or Chevron station; companies that make their favorite clothes, shoes, toys or electronic gadgets; restaurants or fast food companies they enjoy; entertainment company stocks like maybe Disney or Netflix; today maybe social media companies...from there, teach them how to analyze fundamentals on a basic level. he recommends companies that are reasonably valued, low-debt for their type, and profitable. Dividends are a plus but not necessary for every stock or company. then, pick a handful of stocks from different sectors and go from there.

For example the micro-muscle movement detector that allows you to play Subway Surfers without seemingly doing anything, just wiggling your finger a quarter of an inch. Also, while much of the criticism he gets is deserved, you can’t deny that Zuck is a very talented CEO. Putting faith in him doesn’t seem like a terrible proposition.Somewhere in this giant stack of technology being developed is a cash cow, I’m certain of it.

ASTS - At this point, I don’t really have a choice, lol. I want it to succeed. Ultimate risk/reward play and a cool company.CNRG - Clean energy ETF that will be the biggest position in my portfolio overtime. I’m ultimately investing in what comes next.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 07:43:50'] I've been buying up JEPI as a safe haven for now. Low volatility, high dividend, but you aren't going to make those "tech gains." I took on too much risk this year ignoring the obvious "cash is king" and need to have something stable at the moment, so I can focus on making better decisions with what I have been saving for 2023 and the Fed flippening.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 11:03:23'] Just buy. Waiting around does nothing. Best advice I've ever gotten so ill pass it to you.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 11:28:37'] I've read this off another post: "TIME in the market is more important than TIMING the market".
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 12:15:46'] Like everyone else said, in the long term it won't really matter, however I do think it'll be cheaper to buy now. After the split, it's going to become much more accessible to traders who are starting out/ don't have a lot of funds to trade with so they'll be buying up those shares.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 12:21:16'] Buy now, if it dips before split buy even more - after the split it will moon cuz it´s "cheap" to get into AAPL

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 11:54:43'] Stock splits don’t generate value. Markets are reasonably efficient, and any short-term effect will disappear. All that matters are expected future cash flows.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 13:46:34'] To actually answer your question, stocks historically run up prior to splitting.  That’s what you saw today.  If you want to own it, DCA into it or just buy in 1/3rd’s to get a better average.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 14:35:34'] Wait for a dip, after this crazy rally it should drop a bit. And jump back up when they’ll announce the new iPhone with nothing new in it
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-04 04:16:45'] Before for the run up.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 11:03:55'] That’s my thinking on it too so I’m picking some up before the split.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-03 12:08:55'] Before because time in the market is what matters. Moreover, once the split happens, newer investors that don’t know what they’re doing will see the low price tag and drive the price up some.

POST_TEXT: b'Anecdotally, Ive noticed when a stock has an insane run up until earnings, any good news (or especially lackluster news) has already been baked into the price (think: Tesla battery day). When a stock doesnt run up until the earnings it takes just a little positive news to move it up (Netflix last week). \n\nAAPL had an insane run up last week. I sold covered calls at 138 and aapl is 140 right now. Ive never seen AAPL move this much in a week. I hold a leap as my underlying so I will continue to lose (1-delta of long) for for every additional dollar it goes over the sold calls. Ill probably hold until the end of the week to see what happens but curious: \n\nDoes anyone have any data showing what happens to companies during earnings when theyve had run-ups prior to them? Conversely, when they were stagnant up until earnings and the company announced they beat earnings? \n\nIts hard for to imagine aapl has good enough news to justify this recent price escalation.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 19:02:27'] They have this thing called the iPhone 12 that wasn’t included in last quarter’s earnings...I’m expecting a blowout report and more gains on the horizon.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 19:30:16'] "I've never seen AAPL move this much in a week."It's not like you have to look "THAT" far back to find a time period where it has moved like this...in the last week of July last year, it jumped 14.73%, yes...aided by announcing a stock split, but I can still remember watching it control the Dow at times before splitting and at times, the whole market. FAANG outside of GOOGL (mostly, as it has had its periods where it has had its own mind) had been in a long consolidation period, and there's a chance it might have just broken out.I wouldn't be surprised if their earnings became a sell the news event, but let's not say that Apple can't do this as it has before.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 20:02:50'] If AAPL sells off on blowout earnings, I’m afraid any continued tech market rally is toast in 2021.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 22:15:10'] AAPL is the greatest stock ever to hold long term.. If they announce an EV car in the near term this stock will rocket even more. I think they announced Project Titan as a ruse and have been secretly working on mastering the EV concept. That is the Apple way...
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 18:59:53'] I’m holding like 17k in Apple calls I think I might sell half before earnings .... but they are saying apples earning will be the best earnings of any company ever literally a 100 billion profit quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 20:07:19'] I’m super long AAPL. Their new stuff is amazing! Those M1 processors blow away Intel processors. iPhone 12 is the fastest phone on the market. More new products coming. Airtags and new redesigned Macs. AirPods are pretty much low cost cost money makers. The Apple store/digital revenue is ridiculous! Oh yeah, don’t forget, they might make their own EV.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 06:18:08'] 6 years ago I had a long term accout with mutual funds in them.  Over the course of 2 years I slowly moved out of them and pick up FAANG under the direction of my parent, who thought a young person should learn their lessons the hard way if need be.I signed some paperwork to be a self directed account.  Haven't looked back since.Ironically I got a full time job since then that offers 401K.  Only mutual funds are offered.Nothing against mutual funds.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 04:50:17'] AMD has a lot of upswing potential. AAPL just had a target price of 160 set. It's currently in the 120s. I say go for it if you want. AAPL is an own forever stock though.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-09 05:04:46'] >Not sure how to separate just mutual fund performance into YTD performance.Before deciding whether or not to get out of the mutual funds, you need to be able to be able to see their performance in an apples to apples comparison with your stocks, to see how well they're doing. 93% YTD is pretty great for a mutual fund. 93% cumulative  over several years is not as great.I think AMD and Intel have been put on notice by Apple's new M-series processors; x86 has a limited future. They are also at a disadvantage to Nvidia, who just purchased Arm Holdings. NVidia looks to win no matter who emerges as the primary competitor to Apple's newest and upcoming Macs. AAPL is a winner for any number of reasons, but Macs don't comprise enough of Apple's business for the M-series chips to move their stock price much.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 21:16:53'] Institutional money is a lot bigger than retail money. Don’t think this is going to go to 60-70 P/E ratios. 2 trillion dollars of market cap in a year is just an insane amount of money. That’s the equivalent amount to Tesla gaining 7x it’s current value

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 22:01:55'] Holding Apple.Are you playing short term positions or long term hold?For long term holders, the price movement after split doesn’t matter. What I pay attention to are their earnings each quarter because at the end of the day if their business isn’t delivering then all gains will disappear. See Intel. They lost all their gains instantly.Apple needs to continue growing their revenues in all segments, not just services to maintain their new 35x earnings multiple. Any further price rises just makes it harder to grow into. Do you think Apple has enough growth potential to be valued at 40x earnings? (Although I want this to happen, growth will most likely fall between 10%-20%)They used to be a sub-20x earnings stock which meant zero growth was expected. Now the growth expectations are on par with other big tech companies.Although even with zero growth I don’t think sub-20x multiple will return because the market multiples are higher overall.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 22:14:46'] Put 10k on it today at around 468, been watching it go up the entire week. Idk if it'll double or not but it was under $200 just a year ago. I doubt things will change up until the next iphone release.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-21 04:10:42'] The new series of phones this fall are supposed to be a huge step forward. They will also launch 5G capability which won't practically affect most people but will be a big selling point regardless. Couple the new phones with some other random new product(s) like an airpod update or something similar and you will see a lot of hype. 🤑Now is a great time to get in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 23:28:47'] The outstanding shares are too high after the split. Shit is already 4B and it’s about to explode to 16B. You have no idea what you’re saying if you think Apple will double in a year. Doubling in a year would mean they’d have a 4T marketcap.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 23:27:54'] Literally 0 shot it doubles before 2021. You think this has a shot at a 4 trillion market cap this year?!?! Man you must be on some good shit.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-21 07:53:30'] I agree that Apple will likely hit 500 before the split. Possibly by early afternoon, today.  I think doubling by the end of the year is optimistic, though. Who knows in this market, though? Anything could happen.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-21 08:41:54'] The Nifty 50 is now the Nifty 5: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon.  It’s not the best sign when all the institutional money flows into a select few stocks.  I don’t think this ends well.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 22:10:48'] I have a bet ridding with another redditor that it would hit $500 dollars.  Two more windows to prove him wrong.Ninja edit: I think we’ll see closer to $550 before the split.
