POST_TEXT: b'Last week I picked up a July 21 230 call.  Tesla has been such a sick run I was riding it out.  Had a price target of 239 when I wanted to sell.\n\nThis recent run had been great and I didnt want to sell yet but I was looking for a pullback.  Figured I would try and scalp 4 - 232.50 june 16th puts.  Picked them up close to the market close.\n\nNow we have a crazy after hours run and Im not sure what to do. \n \nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated \n\nPositions:\n\n1 - july 21 230 call - 12.00 price \n\n4 - June 16 232.50 puts - 6.60 price'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:02:35'] If you have the buying power to short $TSLA you can flatten the delta on the call by selling shares. For example if the call is at 70 delta, sell 70 shares short. This gives you a position delta (shares plus option) of zero. If $TSLA keeps climbing, you'll still make money (the delta on the option will increase all the way to near 100) and if the stock tanks, you are covered by the short shares.You kind of did this with the puts but right now you are heavily biased negative deltas. If you can't short shares (not enough BP) then reduce your put deltas (sell some of those puts) until you have roughly offset the current call delta.You don't have to use ATM puts btw, so long as the deltas offset.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 16:33:19'] Since it is a July expiration option I would hold it till the end of the day tomorrow, Friday.  Price could approach 260.  No telling what happens on Monday.I had something like this happen to me a year and a half ago on a Tesla option.  After hours news drove the stock price higher I was up like five times.  At open the next day it dropped straight down for the first 15-20 minutes.   I sold.   For $1,000 gain.  If I had held it to the end of the day it would have been $8,000.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:20:55'] When your short position is twice the size of your long position, that's not a hedge, that's a strong conviction bet on the price going down. You can sell your puts for a big loss tomorrow or hold them into next week for the chance of a reversal or a total loss. Neither case is going to be good, and it will be hard to get out of the whole trade with any profits. Next time, hedge with a small position with more time to expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 23:52:40'] I don't really have much advice on the situation you are in. It seems like you are betting for a drop based on your 4 to 1 put to call ratio. I believe hedging is like 1 for 1.This doesn't help now but...what you could have done which might not have been super exciting was:1. Sold a call against it. A 7/21 250c would have got you 12.60. That would have covered your initial cost and should you have held to 7/21 and Tesla stayed above 250, you would (in theory) collect another 2k. I say in theory because you would wanna close it at some point before the last day, etc etc. This would be a vertical spread. To be clear if all the above played out you would have earned 1,260 plus 2,000 so 3,260 on your 1,200 that you de-risked by selling the 250C.2. Sold a call with a different date. It would sort of be like a PMCC (poor man covered call) but usually the long call is much longer than a month. You could have sold a 6/16 250C for around 2.90. Hope that it didn't break 250 by 6/16 and sell another one for the week (6/23) later and collected some premiums while protecting your position. Just keep milking it. Should TSLA make a big run you could buy it back at  a loss. But this is a lot of work I think, constantly checking it (which I bet you were doing anyway).3. You could have just sold your 7/21 for 21.10  bought a 7/21 250C for 12.60. You would have de-risked. You would basically have a 7/21 250c for about 350 bucks. If things were going bad you know that as long as you got 3.50 for the 7/21 250c you were break even. Anything above that is gravy. Should Tesla for even higher you could have done a #1 and sold a call against it to lock some profit down the road and still be in the trade. I would have done number 1 or number 3.The biggest issue is you had a plan (sell at 239) and then ignored it. I have done the same. Not judging you. Greed and fear kicked in and you decided to bet against Tesla with your puts.What you might want to do is close everything and take a profit. I am thinking you could still squeeze out some profit from all 5 (when added together basically your call is saving the day). Profit is profit and a win is a win. Theta is going to start eating your \*\*\* on those puts.Just some thoughts. Not sure what the pros have to say. Good luck!&#x200B;Edit: spellling is difficult as is Capitilization and punctuation
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 17:15:11'] Looks like you don't really have any plan before entering your trades. Good way to blow up soon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:17:00'] I know how to hedge a short option but you won’t like the drag
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 19:36:00'] Looks like you hedged in the opposite direction. Hedges are never supposed to be bigger than what you are hedging against
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 00:26:41'] Your June puts might be worth only 2.00 or less by tomorrow if TSLA opens at 246.00 since those expire next Friday.  The likehood of those breaking even by next week will be very low and I think they might drop to 12 delta or less.  If you are now bullish again, I would use the proceeds from selling the puts to buying July call spreads or even selling put credit spreads for some positive deltas.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 04:08:37'] Tesla seems like an impossible stock to ever make money on my being directional. It seems to only have violent moves up and down and if you’re on the wrong side of it directionally it’s bad news. Trust me I know from experience I’ve lost plenty of money in it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 07:54:38'] Price could fall rest of the day.U might need to sell this, secure ur gains.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 10:45:01'] What I don't like about your trade is that you bought puts with a one week expiration with a lot of theta decay.  It's a great trade if TSLA collapses but otherwise, your puts are likely to lose.Hedging is a trade off. You have to decide how much you're gonna give up in order to lock in profits or reduce losses is different for everyone. ParagraphsSome things I would have considered would have been (in no particular order):1) Roll the long call up to reduce cash at risk2) Short some shares 3) Add a collar to lock in gains4) Buy some low cost put spreads (expiring more than one week from now)

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 12:23:17'] Fairly new to this so hoping someone can provide some more context. From everything I've been reading the general consensus is that debit spreads are better in a low IV environment. When we are talking about a low IV environment, I assume we are talking about VIX and /VX, correct?My general understanding was that in a low IV environment such VIX being this low (it hasn't hit under 17 since January of last year), the market, in general, is more susceptible to a bounce or bullish trajectory. Why would it not make sense to utilize a bull put spread in a low IV environment? Why is a debit spread better in a low IV environment? My understanding is that you want to open debit spreads in a low IV environment and hope that IV potentially increases. Wouldn't it make more sense to open a bull put credit spread instead?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 07:45:28'] Be very carful with this analysis because the Tesla value crash is due to 1) Macro 2) Perceived EV  Demand loss 3) Lower oil prices Keep in mind that China will get over the current COVID wave and open back up and oil demand will jump Russia will be defeated in some way and the war will be over The Fed will start to fight deflation with QE and more global liquidity Tesla will be shipping A) 4680 cellls B) Cyber truck C) Semi truck D) Utility power E) FSD based on hardware 4 F) New small car model based on LFP G) AI Robot So it’s nice to estimate options effects but make no mistake on the macro environment ahead or the pending catalysts Also oil production is being under invested in by about $300 billion per year, so as EVs sales rise,  oil reserves will be depleted without replacement capacity being created, so oil prices will double or triple

Unless you are speaking from first hand knowledge about a specific firms open positions then you have zero idea if the position is hedged or not.  You can hedge the delta on short calls many different ways - long underlying, long other strikes, other expirations, short puts, and those are just options within Tesla.  You can also partially offset risk with other ETFs that contain TSLA or any other asset that you think is correlated to directional moves in TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 09:39:30'] Nothing. Celebrate your win when your shares are called away for a profit.You *did* write the call with a strike above your cost basis, right? With an acceptable gain on the shares? The function of a covered call is to sacrifice future gains for cash today, so you'd be getting exactly what you signed up for.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 12:26:34'] My honest suggestion: Try to do experiments on stable stocks like BAC, INTC etc. Not TSLA. If you do a mistake, you will be in huge loss. Volatile stocks are hard to predict and experience matters.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 11:26:36'] Honestly..let it go. Take the profit.Don't roll. You got lucky here.You barely understand what your doing..suggest your paper trade first.... still much to learn.Otherwise play with real money on a cheaper stock with less volatility to understand how to move in and out with options
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 10:45:34'] You can let it expire to likely have the shares called away, presumably for a net overall profit and move on to the next trade.  Or, you can roll it out a week or two for a net credit to collect more premium.  Sometimes you can roll up a strike and still collect a net credit which can help increase the profit.Some education will go a long way here as this is fairly basic stuff - [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/rolling-covered-calls](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/rolling-covered-calls)
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 16:11:21'] Pray and hope it stays above 125 and your shares get calledEarnings is next week and in the current environment, it's very possible for TSLA to crash back to $110 or below
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 16:44:16'] If it remains above the $125 on Friday, take the assignment. You will get the $4 plus you get to keep the premium you sold the call for. Be happy with a 3%+ gain in a short time, way better than a savings account.If the price starts to near your initial $121 by close of market friday close out of both positions. At least you will get to keep most of your premium from the CC and stay out of TSLA for a bit. It will probably tank next week after earnings. I see TSLA possibly hitting $95 in the first half of this year.TSLA is very volatile at the moment between upcoming earnings and a CEO that is doing things by the seat of his pants for the last year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 10:27:06'] I'm thinking to roll my $135c (my cost basis before I started CCs) May calls to 2025 June $170. Today's premium went up more on the 2025 calls. I'd collect a net credit of $2.1k. I think there is a strong chance of a pullback in the near term on TSLA so if the share price drops the premium on the 2025 calls have further to fall and I'd close them out. Probably best not to do anything but I just want to get some net credits from today's 7% move.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 03:37:13'] Don’t close it. It’ll open up $10 itm this morning. Best to take the $400 + premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 03:53:07'] Rolling a ITM CC during a bear market is a terrible plan. Just take your profit. Sell another Call credit spread on TSLA if IVR is still high if not just wait for a pull back and sell a CSP if your even interested in trading TSLA continuously.Take your chips and go play at a different table. Simple
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 07:12:32'] If you dont think there is anymore juice then "sell to close" to capture the extra premium.    If you think it has more room to run in excess of the amount of premium you could currently get then hold onto it.  You will want to be sure to close out that position before expiration, otherwise your broker will exercise and then you will have the cash for those 100 shares locked up in the actual stock until you can unload it.  It is rare anyone would want to exercise options.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 06:57:26'] Could be volatile next week… CPI next Tuesday, Vixperation on Wednesday, and OpEx on Friday.  You’ve already missed the near-term top in $TSLA and should sell your calls for profit on Monday.  Wait until 2/21 before reinvesting those profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 11:46:49'] If your goal is to convert these to owning stock at expiration, you will have negative theta leading up to that point.  That means the options will decay in value all the way until June.  You also don't want to exercise when there is still time value on the options since it is better to sell the call option and buy the stock at current price.  But if you want to hold until expiration and want to have positive theta, you can turn it into a butterfly with a bullish bias.  One example is to sell two 16 June 2023 280 Call for 10.00 and buy one 16 June 2023 300 Call for 7.00 for a credit of 14.00.  This will have a positive theta and you can hold until expiration without having theta risk. You will however still be exposed to delta as this trade has a positive delta so you will lose money if TSLA retraces from the recent highs but that is also the case with your original trade (original trade even has more delta risk).  You can play around with the short strikes based on where you think TSLA will by by June 2023.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 09:56:39'] Next week could be volatile with CPI Tuesday, VIXperation Wednesday, and OpEx Friday.  Your timing with buying these options was excellent and you should 100% sell the calls and wait until 2/21 to allocate the profits.  It appears you’ve already missed $TSLA’s near-term top last week.

What happens to the model when they grow 24% or more for 3-4 years and use a discounted cash flow model of 10-15%. Sure there’s risk in looking farther out. But it’s also in the realm. That’s why there’s such a large range in the stock analysis.  Every year the analysts say it’s going to grow 20-25% and end up growing 40-50%. Not arguing with the price. Just stating the possibility is the divergence.

As an automotive guy, I think there's 0 chance of Tesla continuing to grow 24% / year. The market they operate in is "worldwide car sales". At some point they'll all be electric and that's the maximum Tesla can hope for. Then, how much of that market can they capture? With its current lineup (including CT), they're capped at around 2m cars. And are looking at a compressed profit margin due to competition.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 11:39:27'] There is no "better" way. There are only a lot of shitty ways. Hopefully you wrote the strike so you will net a gain on share assignment? You didn't write the strike below you share cost basis, I hope? Taking assignment is a winning outcome if you selected a strike for a gain on the shares, so just be satisfied with that. I know the FOMO of that huge coulda/shoulda/woulda gain is hard to swallow, but every other alternative may be worse.You'd have to be very, very confident that you will make up the cost of a rescue plan, like buying the call back, to make it worth rescuing a winning trade.

Personally if you're willing to take the risk you should probably roll this up till after earnings which is around 45 days because that's where you're going to get the most premium. You could even potentially roll up further into a debit but just make sure whatever you're paying is less than the width that you're expanding toSo you might pay 5 dollars to get 10 extra dollars (net 5)Also you have to still be bullish or at least to whatever your short strike is going to be

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 16:28:08'] There is no way to do better than what you described. What I do is to roll the calls to 90-130 DTE (or further away) to minimize risk of early assignment. And roll again when they approach 60 DTE. Roll away and up but for a credit.Then I convert the trade into a strangle by selling a put. When selling a put you commit to buy 100 shares so make sure you have cash to cover it. If not I sell a put spread, but a strangle is the best because it helps rolling the entire structure up and down as needed for a credit.Then work out of the hole, roll them up little by little, strike by strike until you get them otm.Also I sell shorter term puts so I can repeat the process again and again, e.g. 130 DTE calls but 7 DTE puts and so on. Play with it and see what is the best.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 16:17:34'] I’m in the same position but I had been actively managing by rolling it up and out every week or so. So far, it’s becoming a losing proposition as I now have my covered call expiring 6 months out at $240 strike.The way I look at it is by considering the covered call as guaranteed income over time. If I roll out a covered call for minimal credit into next month, I consider this to be “dividend” or income at the same strike. If I roll it up and out, I will likely have to pay the difference but the jump in strike prices is also considered “deferred dividend”.Here is an example using your expiration and strike:If you roll out to the same strike to next month, you will receive an income of $190. Two months will give you $410 in income. Three months will give you $730 in income. Assuming these prices are accurate, the best bang for the buck is the 3 months as it guarantees you $240 a month.If you want to roll up and out, you can pay now to guarantee slightly higher income. Next month, $5 strike higher ($190) would offer you $240 instead of $190. The next month, $5 strike higher ($195) would offer you $565 instead of $410. $5 strike higher ($200) would offer you $1,040 instead of $730.If you are confident about where $TSLA price will be in the next six months, then be willing to pay upfront to guarantee income by that date. For example, I believe $TSLA will remain above $250 by January 2024. So I would pay $2,680 to guarantee me $3,800 in actual income or $630 a month.But because you’re paying upfront, you now have no leverage to use cash to get into more aggressive positions such as buying ATM or OTM call options for $TSLA.Let me know if this helps.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 18:28:13'] Hopefully your strik was above your cost basis and you will make profit on assignment.  Afterwards, you can keep selling CSPs at $185 strike to collect premium while you wait for the downturn to come.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:24:37'] Roll them for another month - Aug18 , or something like that. You get a little more coins , will be locked for another months and if TSLA drops you'll keep your shares. Not sure what benefit of keeping shares though, if TSLA drops.    No regrets on missing gains - think of it as part of a bigger scheme. So if you have use for those money then let the calls get assigned and follow the plan. If you have no good ideas for those money, roll for another couple weeks at the same strike, get more theta money, and make plans.

Then you could have exercised yur calls and onky been out the 5$ difference
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 14:34:38'] Just today I rolled my short Jul 2023 $205 call to  $240 Jan 2024 for ~$3/share.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 15:56:59'] are you thinking about buying the call back? maybe after a dip. you can finance the cost with by writing puts on tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 09:01:16'] This is the “risk” of selling CCs. You limit your upside while limiting your downside..Regardless, you are making a small profit on the shares when assigned, plus whatever premium you got.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 03:30:26'] It’s so oversold right now, I would buy the TSLA $250 July 21, sell you shares and let some cash sit as margin for the bear spread.  I would expect TSLA to retrace to at least close to 200,   So the $7300 call you sold will only be worth $1500 at TSLA $200.  You keep the 6K profit now, buy the $2k spread insurance, and profit as it falls.  It’s a directional gamble though.  Otherwise just let them get called away.Honestly I think it could be lower than $185 by July 21.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 11:50:22'] Market risk is increasing - wait till July and then if still deep in money, roll out to August for additional premium credit. Or you can roll now. I am in similar boat but have a significant profit (selected Strike price at my sell target price)

What if you'd gotten assigned on a put around the end of April when it was at \~1000?  A month later it hit the low 600's.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-23 19:02:38'] I did this for about a year. It’s a horrible idea. You cap your gains on big run ups and lose a bunch on the bad days. Feel free to try it and waste a year like I did if you think you know better.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 09:33:47'] I think wheels are best on the popular stocks that are *not that volatile*, so they still have some premium from their popularity but not from huge IV and actual volatile price action that will keep you from milking it for premiums very well.MSFT for example is a great choice still as far as I can tell. I’ve had my dad run a PMCC on it the last year and throughout all the turmoil this year he’s still green with it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 14:08:58'] I have not been wheeling TSLA for the past 21+ months, so much as I have been harvesting premium by selling PUTS.  I've always been ready to take assignment, but have only taken assignment a few times (both on purpose, when the stock was in the 600's, by selling ATM puts).  TSLA has been very good to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-23 19:37:27'] They're not insane. 100 shares of TSLA is just plain expensive. I thought wheeling TSLA at 900 was good. I mean, it's not like I was buying at the top. Finally got rid of that manipulated turd at 650, and don't regret it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-23 20:39:42'] I'm pretty sure this is asked every week. Do people not understand why stocks have high premium or how PE ratios work?It's easy money if you are willing to take the risk. A PE ratio of 106 means that the stock can easily take a 75% haircut if it tanks any time soon. For context, Google has a PE ratio of 21 which is considered normal. You might make your initial capital in gains or you might be left bag-holding, someone certainly will at some point in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-23 20:51:36'] Mechanically wheeling no matter what?  nah...Loosely wheeling, favoring selling puts in uptrends, selling calls in down trends and sideways... suspending activities around market moving events (the rallies don't come out of nowhere, they are related to earnings reports), limiting long exposure when the CEO insider does his quarterly dump of billions of $$$ worth of shares, etc.

POST_TEXT: b'So Tesla stock and options are scary. The options can move either way fairly fast. Worst of all, you can get screwed with IV if you hold too long. But what Ive been doing is using spy as a barometer. When spy looks like its bouncing, I try to time it with Teslas stock dip and potential option dip to get in (usually call first) and then immediately send out a working order to sell a call against it hoping someone quickly buys it when the stock bounces up $0.50 to $0.80. I then buy a put spread with the same strike to lock in the profit. The trick is to be in and out in a minute or two. So far I get out within 10-30 seconds. There are numerous opportunities throughout the day to pile in. \n\nToday for example, my cost basis\n\nAug 26 exp\n\nLong 865c $40.40\n\nShort 867.5c $39.70\n\nLong 867.5p $42.06\n\nShort 865p $40.78\n\nThe condor basically guarantees me a profit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 15:30:49'] This isn’t a condor.Legging in and out of option positions like this is similar to just directionally trading the stock, although not as liquid.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 19:01:02'] So you mean you can find a point where the stock price is guaranteed to rise? In that case just buy a call and sell it immediately after the stock price rises. I think it works until it doesn't.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 21:18:57'] There is a saying about iron condors, "An options trader will either see himself stop trading iron condors or die trading iron condors."Iron condors have some of the worst risk to reward ratio unless you have significant quantitative edge. I much rather sell vertical with only 1 way directional risk, in a stagnant market the options will expire worthless, in a volatile market I will either gain or lose money. 2/3 chances of making money but iron condors only make money in stagnant conditions 1/3. Rarely if ever markets are stagnant, and when they are stagnant the IV already adjusted stripping away the premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-11 15:48:32'] I trade TSLA using a MACD strategy, wait for a direction change, open a call or put based on direction... Create a OCO conditional order (usually $1 strike difference, depending on market momentum) and rake in the profit. Usually in and out in a few seconds or a couple minutes. Very rare does my stop loss hit or I average down if I timed it wrong. Sometimes I take a loss, but I rarely trade sporadic days.

One option you can do here:Sell a cash secure put with a strike of $150. If you do it with 3rd Friday July you can collect about $130 of premium. And if Tesla do drop to $150 and that you got assigned for, at least you do have 15k to own it, you don’t even have to borrow any $$. Owning the stock at $150 is even sweeter then $210 as of now. ✌️

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 10:55:15'] Your wording was confusing but I understand.By writing a call you've effectively stopped yourself from gaining anymore money from your positions past the striek price of the call.Your options are:1) Roll it, probably the best if you own the stock theres no additional expiry to worry about just throw it far out and raise the strike price.  Robinhood has the option to roll single leg options, you can always do this but the roll option is simplified for beginners.  I.E. pick the roll option, pick an expiry further out and up the strike price.  Do it far out so your positive.2) If the strike is above your costs.  Just have it taken away.  Honestly, this here is what you should do if your already at a profit.  Chasing a higher profit will lead to more loss.  Just have it taken away than sell a put in hopes of getting it back later at a lower price. (look up wheel strategy)3) Close the position, it will cost you money.  You played the game and lost, you dont want to lose your stock and this is your last option to resolve it.  This is the worst option.  But sometimes neccessary, rarely.  Should only be done if you expect the underlying to continue to go up.  Your not likely going to make any more money than just having it called away.  IMHO your far to late to close it and it be reasonable.Dont play with options unless your willing to **take the risk**, you wrote a call, you should have accepted that call was an acceptable amount of gain if it passed the strike.  Do not write any calls unless your willing to sell the stock at that strike price and forfeit any potential profits from it going much higher.Dont learn options on stock that is valuable to you and you want to keep long term.Pick something else and much cheaper, greeks will be different but basic principles are the same.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 10:19:22'] “But to close” isn’t a refund button. Youre down $1,700 right now whether or not you close it. Your account balance reflects the current loss
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 10:50:34'] The $1700 is already reduced from your account.The contract(s) you sold count as a negative towards your total investing amount. If you were holding zero shares and only these options you would see your account balance change based on the current price of TSLA.Hence, if you buy a call to cancel out the one you sold your account balance wont change.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:35:28'] Let it expire.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:41:26'] Sounds like you sold covered calls. As long as your strike is 172.5 and you paid below 172.5 for the shares, just wait till Friday. Two things can happen: 1. Tesla price may drop below 172.5 and you won’t have to sell your shares. Keep your premium and enjoy taco. 2. Tsla price will be 205 (let’s assume) your shares will be exercised and overall you will make gains. You don’t wanna BTC options that are deep in the money unless it’s naked and you be margin called. Buy cash secured puts and repeat the cycle.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:33:12'] If you have stock and you sold a call, stay put. You get to keep your premium and the stock is sold at strike price at expiration
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 16:51:11'] That’s true, the amount you pay to close your position will be offset by the gain in your underlying shares so the portfolio value stays the same. However buying power will be less
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:44:19'] In non-option language, say you owe me $1700. You dont want to spend it so you set it aside and when you add up all your personal assets you subtract $1700 since it’s not really yours any more. This would show as a negative entry in your assets.  So if you add up everything you own in life it would be the total less $1700. When you hand me the $1700, your net assets dont change since it was a negative entry. (If that helped, please send me the $1700).  ;)

POST_TEXT: b"Hi all, just want to confirm what I understand about playing options with an upcoming split.\n\nBasically, with a split of 1:3, whatever options I sold will basically reduce their strike and premiums by 1/3, while my number of contracts increase by 3? I.e. if the price stays roughly the same after a split, nothing will change from my perspective. Thinking to sell some options but since this is my first time, I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing here. Thanks for your input."
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 11:17:30'] Your understanding is correct.In the future you can look up such adjustments from the OCC itself. For example, here is the one for the TSLA stock split (PDF warning):[https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=50828](https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=50828)In that memo it explicitly states that the new options multiplier is still 100, the contract multiplier is 3.00, and strike divisor is 3.00.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 09:14:46'] Respectfully, I wouldn't choose Tesla as your first options trade. Maybe I'm in the minority, but you can get burned pretty bad there. Just my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 08:14:30'] Correct.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 18:22:35'] I'm just gonna keep it simple. Don't short the stock if you don't have the shares ( don't use margin as well.) Limit your downside. Don't be that guy on lossporn. If you managed to turn 30k into half a mill, take the god damn profit. If you feel like gambling, in the above situation, take the profit and just gamble with the 30k. Don't go all in after your first "congrats, fuck you." Moment.  Cuz you'll have a good chance to fast track to "I'm sorry for your loss."

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 12:32:03'] Be sure to include the premium you pay for such an option as the stock will have to drop to that amount at expiration to profit.  A random example is a 21JUN24 200 long put would cost about $22 ($2,200) with a breakeven point of $178.  The delta of the 200 put is .21 that means about a 21% probability of being ITM when it expires.  Looking at the BEP the 175/180 is about a .15 to .16 delta for a 15% to 16% probability being in that range.This shows it is a low probability trade based on these numbers.Moving up to a higher delta can increase those probabilities but at a higher cost to open and this increases risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:29:43'] > What Else is there important to know?Theta decay, implied volatility, gamma, bid/ask spreads, liquidity, exit planning, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 14:26:22'] Earnings are in about 5 weeks, you might want to review last quarters call and figure out what the most optimistic scenario is
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:27:58'] Better to buy a put long vertical than long put. Give yourself a decay and delta equalizer if your wrong in the short-term. Or even short sell shares
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 19:55:03'] if you go long-dated put on household names, especially the volatile kind, you are giving free money to the market makers.> 18JAN2024, costs 1,030€, delta at -.19, strike at 185€.BEP 174.70 or 188 USD, that is below $200 you mentioned. It could profit modestly if it heads towards 230 or so, but if it pingpongs theta will kill this and by the time it actually hits 200 the option is not going to profit. good stocks don't stay down for long most of the time. if it pingpongs, you are not going to profit as big as a straight down to 185... If you are confident a volatile stock could go down, don't buy put especially the long-dated ones. Go with short calls or short. When you short, you can pick how many shares you want to short. If you could short 50 x 250 = -12500, you could do something with that credit, and if you are right and it goes to 200, you still win 2500. No Greeks involved, because this just copies the move of the shares.Or if you truly want to do this, what you could do is also sell put against this to turn it into a pseudo-bullish move. Ex: 200P for 12.50USD. Then you sell 230p weekly. You should still get decent premium on these as TSLA is-well-TSLA. If it goes above 230p you keep the premium and sell again. If it hits below 230, you roll.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:10:43'] Long is a bought option and short is a sold option.  You either did not do an IC or described it wrong.  Your IC should be short 31.50/36 and long 30.50/37.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 19:39:29'] Your max loss is $100 minus your credit. Not the end of the world (assuming 1 contact). You could roll out your call credit spread. Close your current call credit spread. And then open a new one for a further expiration, at a more favorable price, using a wider width between your short and long call strikes that takes care of your debit to buy to close. Also, wait it out and next week GM could fall back down a little and you'll be fine. Waiting till the last moment is good because it bleeds away the extrinsic value.&#x200B;And also: Your IC is:\+1 $37 call (long)\-1 $36 call (short)&#x200B;\-1 $31.5 put (short)\+1 $30.5 put (long)
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:24:33'] Not an expert. But if it’s only $1 wide minus your credit the max loss here is probably $70??? You are assuming ITM based on aftermarket. It very well might drop $3 at opening tmw.  I might close out the bottom, leave the call spread. Hope for a move down or roll or take the L.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:38:12'] If you think it will come back down, then you could wait a little bit and then close it after it reverses. Otherwise, closing early as soon as possible will help you to avoid max loss.How many iron condors did you sell?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 20:52:26'] There is pretty much always extrinsic value in any option before expiration. Your deep ITM call option has the same theta as an OTM put of the same strike.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 21:32:48'] Yes, it does.Total value = intrinsic value + extrinsic value. The extrinsic portion of the value still decays as expiry approaches like any other option. At expiry you are left with purely the intrinsic which will be 0 for OTMs and > 0 otherwise
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 01:22:46'] Your itm option is going to be worth a lil more than the intrinsic value.  That difference is going to decay

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-21 21:31:37'] sure does reduce in value with time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 02:57:26'] All options decay, whether they are ITM or OTM.  There are few exceptions, namely if you are super ITM or OTM.  Most don’t trade those however.  Even then…all options have time value to some degree, or extrinsic value, that decays over time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 16:24:15'] I find ITM options often have a much higher IV on the day of expiry so if you are going to close your position don’t wait until the last day as buyers want a premium for giving you the chance to buy back your covered calls.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 22:37:58'] It's so deep ITM that you're essentially owning the stock.Why not just buy the stock and sell slightly OTM monthly covered calls? The premiums you collect will likely be far greater.

Go for the smaller gains with more modest risk and build capital.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 07:51:36'] with all the Elon news you might really want to wait on this and see how it plays out. gives you time to think about your strategy. If TSLA drops too far he could be margin called on his shares from the TWTR deal. if the TWTR deal goes through im sure TSLA is going to take a hit. I forgot the name for it but i would buy a long dated put and sell puts against it and hedge with some calls. more long than short. plus dont forget that the interest rate hikes crashed tech. also Elon is worshipped by his followers, they’re the reason the stock went up so high, aside from the short squeezing and financials getting better. Optics and sentiment is a big part of the stock, expect it to drop further if his followers lose faith in him. Poorman’s covered put + long calls. If you have the time and energy to actively manage it, you could also set up a double diagonal

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 22:52:20'] The chances of assignment is near 0 until the last few weeks, TSLA is very liquid so assignment risk is very low. I personally wouldn't recommend this trade, I rather use the money to go long or just own the stock. The risk to reward ratio is decent, but sounds like low risk low reward to me. At minimum I prefer low risk, medium reward.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 05:27:42'] That deep ITM for that long out you have a much higher chance of having it exercised which would put you immediately in the red and under margin call
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 06:22:07'] You will get assigned on this. Also liquidity is going to be an issue for you so spreads will be large that deep ITM. You also get no advantage because you are not selling very much risk premium.Why not sell out of the money puts if you are that interested in owning the stock? You collect $$ and possibly only take ownership of if it keeps dropping.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 22:50:33'] Unless it's european style options, you could be assigned instantly. I could literally buy 100 stocks of tesla, buy the put your writing and excersise it, literally forcing you to buy my 100 tesla shares at $1000.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 10:09:22'] Your idea:Advantage:- You can likely sell an excellent IV at $500. Your ITM put can generate profits just by a potential IV crush.Disadvantage:- ITM puts have little extrinsic value to sell (even this one seems to have a lot compared to other instruments). Today the 1000 put costs 440 and has 85 extrinsic value, or a theta of 14.\- You need to deploy a lot of capital. It seems inefficient for this extrinsic value.- Theta decay is inefficient ITM.Solution: If you sell slightly OTM puts, every month until Jan 2024, you probably get more value out of this, especially if you expect that the bottom is somewhere around 500.You could also try to acquire 100 TSLA via assignment, somewhere around 450, and then start to sell ITM covered calls. That would allow TSLA to fall to maybe 350 and you're still not incurring a loss.Should TSLA fall below 300, we probably have other problems than what Tesla is doing. 😂
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 12:18:55'] Sell far OTM puts, they have higher IV so more edge.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 10:26:36'] A big difference between futures trading and options trading is that options have convexity, but futures don't (ignoring backwardation and contango). The P/L payoff of an option *when closed before expiration* vs. the underlying price is almost never a straight line. It's better to think of the P/L as a set of curves, one curve per point in time.https://moontowermeta.com/where-does-convexity-come-from/Here's a visual example using a September AAPL $200 call. Make sure the "Chart Style" at the bottom is set to the graph icon and $ profit/loss.http://opcalc.com/SpH
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 10:09:33'] Buying options usually benefits from price action provided the analysis is correct.Stop loss orders are possible and can work better on single options vs spreads or multiple leg options.  The problem with these is that options pricing can move a lot quickly and there will be times when the SL order price is blown thru and doesn't close.  Most brokers offer some form of stop loss order, but be aware that they may not work everytime.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:47:07'] Buying options give you a way to capitalize on your opinion if the implied volatility of the underlying will increase. If you are correct and the stock stays the same, you can make money of the long option position (and vice versa if you are wrong).Likewise, you can be correct about the direction of the underlying. However, you would lose money if the implied volatility goes down (i.e., you buy a call and the underlying goes up, but the option's implied volatility goes down and you end up losing money).Thus, you may have to be correct with your forecast of the underlying and the implied volatility of the option in order to make money on your proposed trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:01:22'] Sell put spreads on spx and buy /es to hedge it. Spx drops volatility spikes making those e minis explode.  If it goes up just keep the credit on the spread. 10 15 percent a year and double your account in a crash forgive there is usually a crash black swan event every couple years. Spreads are defined risk so you’ll make out like a bandit only losing width then cashing in all that volatility
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 18:54:17'] FYI - you can a replicate a future on any stock with a synthetic long. Buy an ATM call, and sell a put at the same strike. If you want a short future, reverse that.As for replicating stop orders, that's a bit more tricky. Technically you can set up a complex order to do a market buy/sell when the underlying hits a certain price, but option liquidity is its own beast. Best case, you eat a tight bid/ask. Worst case, you are the victim of market maker or vulture shenanigans and get absolutely ass blasted on your fills, losing hundreds or in some cases thousands (yes, it's happened) in the process.If the potential profits from your system ran on individual tickers is enough motivation for you, I'd try paper trading them with those complex orders, or doing manual live trading.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 08:19:16'] There is no hidden downside.  If your cost basis is 800, and you are happy selling it at 900 1.5 wks from now, then go ahead and make the trade.Most people like these kinds of trades until they see the underlying go from 800 to 850 in one day, then they regret it.The only thing I would say is you should sell options into strength, not weakness.  Recent price activity is weak.  So you are not getting good premium.  If you wait for TSLA to move up sharply over a few days, call volatility will expand and premiums will go higher.  This giving you more choices.You just have to be patient.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 11:27:36'] I like your optimism that tesla could 900 next week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 09:37:37'] Take the advice to someone who has won at CC on Tesla since Jan 1stGo minimum 200 dollars otm at maximum 2 weeks til expiration, that is the safest way to do this

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 08:10:37'] Other downside is taxes from the sale.    I'd certainly go forward with the idea since you'll get a profit even if you lost your stock.  Make your shares pay rent
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 13:09:32'] An additional risk is Tesla (the underlying) can still tank.  There is a real possibility (I happen to believe likely) scenario where Tesla’s valuation (PE multiple) reverts back to car/tech company levels and the stock plummets, perhaps never to revisit these highs again (or at least for a VERY long time). TLDR: could be picking up dimes in front of a steamroller
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 11:31:09'] TLDR;options premiums are too low and no buyers, better off to avoid messing with the market until it recoverswe are in a bear market. expect this to last a bare minimum of 6 months, and up to 2 years. u will see false “recoveries” followed by mass selling. significantly reduced options premium and significantly less buyers. its better atm to not be in the market IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 08:29:37'] Selling calls is one of the most stable methods of income generation the market offers. Absolutely do it. Do it at a price point you wouldn't mind having to sell at though. Aiming for lower premium isn't bad either, because it makes a loss cutting assignment less likely. People will walk away from $50 more easily than $500.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 08:58:08'] In volatile times it's better to go deep.Sell the call that would make you 5k on execution not the 10k set up.Gives you more protection and let's be honest 5k in 1.5 weeks on 80k is still damn good money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 09:44:10'] As others have said, taxes is the only real other downside on a basic option like this. It's the more complex trades that can lead to large hidden loses. If you haven't held the shares for over a year, you're paying short term capital gains. Any accounts outside of my tax free accounts, I will not sell calls on anything I've held for less than a year.If the stock does rally beyond $900 and let's say it's a massive rally to $1300 or something (not probable, but I ain't throwing out an possibility in this market), you might not be happy selling at $900. You could roll your call "up and out". The stock could continue to rally and you could end up rolling up and out for a long time, but eventually, you'll hit a point of "I'm okay selling the stock for xxxx when I paid $800, I'll just get assigned even though I'm missing out on xxxxx gains".
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 11:44:42'] Downside is if Tesla does rally to $900 by next week- you gain 10,000 in but lose 100 tesla shares that could be worth substantially more in a few yearsTesla is volatile AF. Could it be $900 next week? Sure with Tesla crazy shit is possible. Is it likely: No the market as a whole sucks
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 13:00:50'] The main thing to keep in mind is how much risk you're taking relative to the potential profit.If you're bounding the upside while still being exposed to a major downside then it might no longer be worth holding the position. VS if the upside is unbounded then even very risky positions can be worth taking.E.g. if you have an 80k position and are risking a X% 40k loss but Y% chance to double it to 160K then ok, that's a bet. But now w/ a covered call it might be the same X% chance of losing 40k (mitigated only slightly by the covered call) but a bounded upside
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 18:03:25'] Remember that even if price moves to 900+, you're not completely locked into selling @ 900. You could roll into longer out expiration date, earn some additional premium, and sell for higher price. Keep an eye on daily movements as it gets closer to 900.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 08:07:48'] I'd go up to $1k calls but thats just me
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 10:10:40'] [Please read about tax implications selling covered calls](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/tax-implications-covered-calls). If you're in the US and you've held your shares for less than a year, selling a weekly covered call will reset your holding period back to 0.But given your cost basis is in the 800s I'm guessing you didn't buy in the last year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 08:32:24'] Lol rally past 900. Good luck
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 14:43:49'] I would expect a bounce soon, however I do not see 900 in Tesla’s future….pretty much ever, sorry.  Love Musk and Tesla, but it has been a pure benefactor of speculation, which as we all know is now being bleed from the system and QT via balance sheet reduction hasn’t even started.  My best guess is TSLA under 100 (before any split), come 2024.Go ahead screen shot this and put it on your calendar.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 09:03:55'] Taxes as mentioned on the sale of the capital (good problem to have).Bigger risk that Tesla sinks to $700 in that time frame. In that instance you have some options premium as income but a bigger loss on the capital. Current options market pricing says:The $900 strike pays you $5 for next Friday. **The probability in the options market pricing says there is a 7% chance of Tesla hitting $900 by next Friday. The same market says there's a 16% chance of Tesla hitting $700 in same time frame.** So, sell calls closer to the 795 price - you get more premium. With covered calls in a bear market / confused market, you want to get exercised - that's premium + capital gain. Sell the $810 strike and get $26 premium. If it gets exercised, you get $26 premium +$15 cap gain =$41 for just over one week of risk. If it goes to $900 so what, no-one can ever time everything perfectly. If it goes to $900 be glad you made money at $41 which is great return.  AND be glad it did not go to $700 instead as both are possible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 12:46:23'] B

Then, when it stays relatively stable there for a few years, the premiums will dry up, forcing you to accept closer strikes to get the same amount.  Your shares will get called away for something like 420$, and you'll be out of Tesla with a massive net loss.You heard it here first

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 19:02:38'] There's two reasons to go long spreads:1) lower capital investment2) lower net negative thetaUnlike short positions, where spreads drastically affect capital requirements because of unlimited risk, spreads for long positions are much less significant. If you're just learning I wouldn't bother with long spreads. Just buy the option.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 22:11:51'] In almost every circumstance doing a spread is better than doing naked callsSpreads technically limit your profit, but in practice they don’t if you design them properly, and are a cheaper and less risky way of doing callsYou can design the spread so the call you sell is the highest price you think the stock will be, and as the stock approaches the SP of the call you sold you can just close out the spread for a profit, and create a new spread with a higher range The benefit is the spread will be much cheaper, suffers less from theta loss, and is a much less risky way of doing calls especially if you are swing trading or doing LEAPs
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:16:29'] Use a spread only when you can't afford a single ATM call (cost is greater than 5% of total account value). If the single calls are already less than your risk tolerance, go with the single call. Don't use OTM calls just to save costs, though. Given these choices:1. ATM call costs $1000 (50% of total account value)1. Far OTM call costs $100 (5% of total account value)You'd be better off using an ATM call spread than the OTM call with tiny delta.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 10:33:32'] Call spreads or Put spreads?  Calendar spreads?  Leaps?  Look at a 30 day iron condor. Do it on paper for a couple weeks if you have paper trade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 16:00:05'] I think “worst comes to worst” would be Tesla’s multiple re-rating downward towards the rest of the automotive sector (let’s say a 50% drop for worst case?) giving you a tasty 315K loss on the underlying, offset by 96K premium for about 210K loss total. This is not the right stock in the current macro environment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 16:10:00'] Absolutely DO NOT use all of your margin buying power to go all in on one stock, especially as volatile as TSLA. If it has another 10% drop one week, you’re looking at a margin callEdit: ALSO DON’T SELL LEAPS, ESPECIALLY ALL IN, OH MY GOSHthis isn’t financial advice
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 20:20:36'] Personally, I think this is a rather risky time to deploy all your capital, especially with margin, on a volatile stock. By the way you asked this question, no disrespect intended, I’m guessing that you’re newer to selling premiums, and I would just say that pacing yourself and waiting to use margin until you’ve found a consistent strategy that works for you personally, and once you’ve been able to replicate this for months then consider margin but not before. That said, you could consider dollar cost averaging (DCAing) into a TSLA position, at a set schedule over the course of the next few months until you have +100 shares to sell calls against, or perhaps use an ITM LEAPS contract to sell calls against, and regardless of how you get to your long position — run it with one contract before pushing in to sell large numbers. The market conditions right now are not kind to going long on margin on anything, especially with tech. If you had to pick a time to push into some shares, id consider waiting til a retest of SPY lows at 380 and if it breaks downside then everything will be on sale. At the absolute minimum… wait for CPI data and FOMC. Tesla contracts are not the easiest to manage, fluctuate a lot, and the underlying is prone to wild moves — if you are willing to practice with paper trading I think that is an excellent idea. If not, then starting smaller and *no margin* if you’re learning how to run a strategy is the most helpful thing I can highlight within this entire reply. Practice makes perfect, and practice in the market costs tuition (your equity).
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-06 16:23:51'] Why not write 7 puts at $650 a month out, giving you $23,000 in premium and breathing room (from margin call) if it tanks hard. Rinse and repeat. If you get assigned, roll the put or get assigned and sell 7 calls also at $650 for more premium (or bump it to $750 and sell weeklies, hoping for a gradual increase).

Better to stick half of that in the S&P 500, the other half in a combination of Cash secured puts ($600 strike) and Leaps ($800 strike) and forget about using margin. Just what I would do personally. Margin is a force multiplier for luck and you can't control that.If Tesla goes down, sell S&P to get more leaps. If Tesla goes up, sell some leaps after 1 year when they're considered long term gains and buy more S&P.

If you’re smart about it, you’ll be able to buy them back and sell out of the stock before your total loss is too big.

They may be nice and close "just enough", or they may not.  They may or may not leave you with uncovered calls depending on your options level.i.e. TSLA drops 10%, your position drops $70k.  You're account value is now $280k with $560k margin and $630k in TSLA.  They will fire sale at least $70k of your TSLA into the close, and probably a lot more if it's heading down already.So the question is, will TSLA ever be below the buy price of your entry day at any time in the next year, or did you happen to pick the low a year in advance?

The risk is Tesla keeps correcting and if it drops 10% your portfolio goes down by 20% then you get a margin call and forced to sell at a loss.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 03:20:50'] IV right now is around 16% higher then a 252 day average. Expect a drop in premiums. Never trade covered calls for the high premium! Are you ready to hold the stock long term if it drops? Do you like tsla stock? Do you think it can preform long term? You are willing to use margin so be very accurate, one wrong move and your account is in the negatives. Also, Robinhood isn’t the best platform for trading covered calls since it can close your calls early if it’s risk management decides so and you can be left in the red. Consider all of the points above before trading.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 07:45:47'] Selling a 3/17/2023 880c nets about $110 in premium.  Assuming the goal here is premium capture, it's possible there's another way.3/17/2023 is about 40 weeks away.  $110/40 = $2.75 / week.  Right now the weekly 15 delta call (6/10 765c) is selling for about $3.30, which totals 40*3.30 = $132 by 3/17/23.  This call can be hedged by buying 15 shares at $700 for $10,500.  Assuming no dynamic hedging (only holding the 15 shares through expiration), upside breakeven is about $810 or a +16% in one week. 810c is currently trading at 4.3 delta (or a 4.3% chance it hits that price in one week).  I'm ignoring the downside breakeven specifics b/c a bullish mentality obviously don't care about that scenario.  But at least 15 shares per lot is a metric fuckton less downside than 100 👀.  At 9 lots, the 15 delta hedge is 135 shares or only $94,500, which prevents any possibility of margin call scenario on the downside if starting cash balance is $350k.  Also, total premium captured for 9 lots over 40 weeks is $118,800, meaning if the stock trades sideways that whole time, the 135 shares would end up being "free", in fact a $24k profit for acquiring them.Trade obviously goes extremely wrong if the stock collapses and premium can't be collected each week.  Also obviously goes wrong if the stock spikes EVERY week and there's a loss on the 20 delta call every time.  But the probabilities/risks of these scenarios are best left as an exercise in judgement for the reader.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 07:59:32'] Watch out for margin requirements, you’ll need at least 40% to cover your margin. So if Tesla tanks you’ll get a margin call pretty quickly. You’re break even will only be like 670, so watch out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 08:20:43'] Why not use some of that 350k to buy 2x leveraged calls and skip the margin loan and interest payments altogether? Why do you have to buy shares, only to contract them away to a call buyer?A CC exchanges future upside on the shares for cash credit today. Borrowing money to buy shares in order to trade away their upside seems like a terrible idea.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-07 08:47:52'] No, worse comes to worse and TSLA drops and like you said, your whole strat is hosed.  There is no real reason to sell calls that far out in time, as many people have said you could run with shorter term calls and roll them constantly.  My preference is to start with selling a call around 20 delta in the next monthly cycle and then when it gets down to about 7-10 DTE I will roll out to the following month.  Occasionally my call will be breached and I'll need to adjust the strike for a debit but if I'm rolling up $10 and it costs me $6 that is still a win.  As a disclaimer, I am only doing this with ETFs, not single stocks.As another option, why not sell a 20 delta put and roll that?  With 700k you could sell 10 x 20 delta TSLA Jul puts (595 strike) for about 23.20 credit.  So you take 23k in credit and as long as TSLA doesn't tank below 595 you're good.  For something like this I would roll to the next monthly at 21DTE give or take a few days.  As a disclaimer I would not trade at this size, or recommend doing so, in a single stock unless this position represented about 2-3% of my account (ie something along the lines of a $20,000,000 account).

POST_TEXT: b'So I was having a look at the premium you would get if I was to sell a put contract with a strike price of $1,150 that expires 1/19/2024. The premium would be worth $42,600\n\nI think my break even price would be $724 per share before I would make a loss.\n\nIf left to expire and not be called I would gain around 37% ROI \n\nInterested in hearing pros and cons to this.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 12:34:46'] That’s a very large piece of change you’re keeping on the sideline, assuming your broker requires cash security.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 13:28:45'] So your best case scenario is tesla closes above 1150 for a 37% gain.But it'll take 3 years so really your annual compound return is 11% which is slightly better than market average, but might be better just to hold stocks that you think will outperform.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 12:51:53'] You would make 37% AT THE END indeed. But even assuming 100% chance of success, it's almost a deposit certificate. If TSLA starts to just hover around the 1100/1300 marks, that option will decay veeeery slowly.LEAPS are king for buying not selling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 15:21:48'] Tesla bull here. I did this with June 23 $1000 puts a few months ago before the recent run up.  My break even was calculated at $650. Many in the Tesla investment community have sold long dated puts like this. I was able to use my margin as collateral   Probably wouldn’t do it if I had to keep cash out on the sidelines. For me it made sense because I didn’t have more free cash to invest but also wanted to make bullish play on Tesla while using my existing position in Tesla as collateral. I had similar thought process as you. When i sold it seemed like this position is a safe/conservative play  based on break even at expiration and my expectation of the stock price. Not investment advice just my thoughts and experience.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 16:37:45'] Fidelity has TSLA on 30% margin, so once I did about 4 of these they'd be paying for themselves until Elon's next tweet scares the fuck outta everyone. Hmmmm, my inner WSB Tard is tellin me no guts no glory.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 13:19:54'] Pro: you can make up to $42,600Con: you can lose up to $72,400
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 17:21:20'] If I understand the proposed contract correctly: $1150 PUT strike, Jan 2024 expiration (26 months), 1 contract (100 shares), $42.6k premium (the mid is actually higher right now but let's use your value), and 115k Cash Secured Put collateral.Averages $1,638 per month, before taxes, yielding 1.42% return on collateral per month.Risk is primarily opportunity cost - having 115k locked up with your broker for 26 months limiting you from using it on anything else. You would also have to pay short term capital gains tax this March on the $42.6k assuming no early assignment accompanied by a cost-basis offset sellback.Best case: stock rises above $1150 well before expiration, you buy-to-close for much less expensive cost, you keep the premium, and free up your collateral to use for something else.Ok case: stock barely hits $1150 right at expiration, you are not obligated to buy the stock, the collateral that your broker has been making money off of for the last 26 months is returned to you, you still keep the premium.Worst case - and not even really that bad: TSLA slides below $1150 and stays there for 26 months and you are obligated to buy 100 shares of TSLA at your strike and baghold at whatever price it's at.Nightmare fuel - TSLA goes bankrupt, you face early assignment, although you kept the premium, it's offset by the fact you own worthless shares, selling them back in an attempt to lower your cost basis for the year. You've lost $72.4k.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 16:47:44'] Too far out for 37%.  Three years and your cash sits on the sideline.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 17:35:23'] The cons are that it falls 80% and never recovers which could legitimately happen in 2 years if we're really in a bubble caused by a decade of asset inflation brought on by unprecedented "quantitive easing" performed by the federal reserve and when it tightens policy stocks fall similarly to how they did in 2000. The other con is that if you're really so bullish you could make more than 37% by just holding the stock that you buy via specific entry point analysis or even discount averaging and make better returns on your money. If it falls to an extreme point on an extreme put you sold and you get assigned there's absolutely no guarantee that whatever extreme scenario that is occurring doesn't cost it to fall twice as far or whatever. Just because it seems impossible now doesn't mean at all that the risk is as low as you think it is. If you're truly "fine" holding tesla at any price then I guess there's zero downside for you and you should just jump in. The pros are you get 37% return over roughly two years. However if you could make more than an annualized return of 18% or so then this isn't even worth it anyway and it just locks up your money for no reason.The biggest problem with selling calls or puts is that it's always collecting pennies in front of a bulldozer. You may not realize it but the bulldozer exists whether you see it or not. Nothing is free in this life. Absolutely nothing. Nothing ever will be. The moment you start thinking there is free money out there especially on wallstreet is the moment you become a sucker that makes someone else rich. Even if money is free because the fed inflates assets to infinity then you would've potentially Locked up money that could've kept up with asset inflation and instead locked it at 37% which may not even be enough to keep up with real  inflation over the next two years notice I said real. So even in the scenario where the USD literally becomes free it's not free money. It will be very far from free money. Tesla could be below 700 next week next month or next year. It could also go to 3000 next year if they release full self driving to all customers and create robo taxis and semis bla bla bla and you'll still have earned less on your money than if you'd done something else. Everything you're doing has opportunity cost.That means nothing is ever free
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 21:44:15'] Just keep in mind that someone was willing to spend $42,600 betting that you're wrong when you entered into this contract.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 17:03:44'] Or you can sell a $900 Tesla put expiring 17 Dec for $5k. 1/8th the amount of money for 1/20th the amount of time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 22:25:22'] strike 1150$? god bless you for being the liquidity provider lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 13:38:33'] Are you doing this as a cash secured put, or are you using margin?Just realize that implied vol could go up faster than the downside move of the underlying and that changes the premium of the option (i.e makes it harder to buy back when ivol spikes). If you held for 3 years, the ivol is less sensitive to changes in vol but regardless, you have to be ok with Tesla getting crushed. Just understand there is alot of risk on this trade and I doubt you are fully pricing that in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 19:20:10'] TSLA was at your break even price only 5 weeks ago, I believe the likelihood TSLA is below your break even is much higher than you are figuring. If this gets anywhere close to a reasonable valuation you are in trouble. Imagine tying up $100k just to lose 30%+ over 2 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 22:04:40'] Ignoring company specific dets, there’s barely any theta decay with a put 3 years out. This is more of a directional play with large margin req.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 01:47:19'] If you can have the patience to wait for a serious pullback, such as it coming back down to 700 or 800, you will be able to sell a much lower strike put, and have a lot less money on the line.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 11:02:05'] Yeah let me sell a put on the one stock absolutely everyone believes has an insane valuation as we enter tapering and all other car manufacturers actually start production of EVs, all for 11% annualized return in a best case scenario, while also having to either pay for margin or suffer massive opportunity cost with the cash.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 18:06:24'] No one seems to be considering the real possibility that a counter party could exercise against your sold put at any time.  I didn’t see if this was a cash secured put or sold naked.  Either way, if there were a market correction of 20% and everything was going down, could your portfolio handle it?  Or would the resulting increased margin requirements break you?I’ve sold puts for years and make a decent yield doing so, but it isn’t free money without risk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 20:46:36'] As the expression goes “theta eats ass” so your gains from theta are going to start off very slow. You are basically banking on delta hoping the price goes up so you can buy it back early for a win. The delta is -0.38 vs 0.638 for buying a LEAPS. With buying a LEAPS delta will go up if the stock goes up between now and expiration. And you tie up significantly less cash.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 00:20:55'] You comfortable with having 115K sitting around for 3 years? That’s ~12% annually (simple math) which is at best in line with the market for significantly more idiosyncratic risk. No thanks

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 07:36:49'] The biggest downside is just that you’re tying up 115k for a little over 2 years. Not sure if this means putting all your eggs in one basket for your portfolio or not.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 07:47:55'] If you do something like that close at certain profit %, don't hold until expiration.  I think the downside to this is holding capital that long when you can be reusing for other tradesI have been selling TSLA naked puts all year, 90 - 120 DTE and average time I am in the trade is 30-40 days.  But I also sell them 5-10 delta.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 07:54:21'] Your 37% on an annual basis is less than 16%. Is that a good return for you given the risk you are taking? The risk is whether TSLA will be worth $724 in Jan 2024. I strongly doubt so, but I have been wrong so many times...LOLI wouldn't do it, but I wish you well
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 09:08:53'] You utter moron. This is a bubble near its peak.I love TSLA as a company, but Jesus fuck, it has gone up more than the market cap of the next biggest 3 car manufacturers, combined, in the last month. While simultaneously losing fucking market share to them.You are essentially betting on TSLA to become as profitable as goddamn AMZN in the next 3 years. All of this while not capturing any of the unlimited upside bubbles provide and leveraging the downside.This may be the single worst trade I have ever seen in my entire life.Let’s put it this way. TSLA could have it’s value cut in half and still be way overvalued at a 6-700b market cap, and you’ll be in the hole a significant chunk of change.If you are bullish on TSLA(or even just bullish on the bubble) just go long manAll of this risk for a 12% yoy return.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 18:52:08'] Tesla is, with an extremely generous valuation, a 100 dollar stock at most.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 19:07:06'] Why not sell weeklies of the same delta and wheel it with whatever happens? The 2024 1150 Put is .37 delta. The 11/19/2021 .37d put is at 985 strike, and currently mark is ~ 45.50. Assuming it expires OTM and you keep 100% of premium that's a 4.62% ROI for 10 days till expiration. 4.62% annualized is 420%. Looking at this thread it seems like selling put LEAPS is a thing on TSLA, but it just seems inefficient to me.edit: Also what is your bigger picture take on Tesla? You sound bullish, but are you holding any long positions at all? Again, seems like a bit of a waste to take a bullish short put position for 2 years without any straight long position. What if Tesla continues its trip to the moon and goes to 2k? If you're not also long, then you miss out on all that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 19:38:28'] That's about one percent a month, on average, in returns, but most of it comes in the last six months. Take a look at the January 2023 puts and see how little the price difference is on that. That price difference is reasonably close to what your proceeds would be in the first year.You would be better off selling monthly puts on the same underlying. Maybe with a lower strike price if that fits your risk/reward goals better.I think you would probably make money, but you are tying up twice what you are making for a little over two years.If you have portfolio margin, the collateral required is low enough that the premium increases buying power rather than collateral reducing it, and you want to take out some cash for a couple years, this might be worthwhile. But I don't think it would be otherwise.That being said, I don't have PM, and I don't know if it is possible that selling short puts, even in this extreme case, would increase buying power after collateral.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 19:40:58'] Selling puts naked or not are good when the share drops significantly and best not to have it long term. Who wants to be thinking about it looming over their head for 3 years? Not I

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 00:42:53'] The cons are keeping the collateral for the duration of the option.

Also, if you are bullish on TSLA you can get more ROI by buying shares and selling CCs.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 08:32:54'] The main con so far out is that even if TSLA is incredibly successful, increases production, revenue and profits, the earnings multiple it trades at is ludicrous. It's quite likely the multiple becomes more reasonable as the company matures and experiences economies of scale in which case that breakeven price would be obliterated.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-23 11:27:14'] Selling a put is a bullish position. So you’re hoping it goes up. Likely it will go up. However if it goes under your strike price, they can put it to you AT ANY TIME. That’s why the premium is so high. Because there’s a huge risk to be betting it’s going to be above a certain amount for 2+ years. And when they do put it to you, In other words, force you to buy 100 shares of the stock, You have to be prepared to buy it with the cash.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 18:34:12'] Might be smart to simultaneously buy equal number of puts much lower say around 420 strike for around $50.That means right now you make around $348-50 = $298 premium of profit. But if the price starts going down ; the one you bought will also gain in value. Plus if by some miracle Tesla goes to 0 or < 420 you wouldn’t be losing any further money.Basically once it gets closer to the date you can decide what you want to do ; sell your put or hold on to it for insurance purposes.You could also buy more lower strike puts and make even more on the way down but of course it lowers your premium made right away if Tesla continues up or is flat.

Fair enough, I now learned a lot more and I'm learning from youtube videos a robinhood worker gave me (i called robinhood at like 1am to ask a lot of questions, guy was also really cool).

That's just my theory though and I put a lot of money into trusting it (a lot for me cause im broke, not alot to a lot of you).That's not how $TSLQ works. It's an inverse $TSLA ETN. Read the prospectus, it walks you through this stuff: https://www.axsinvestments.com/download/582/tslq/6682/summary-prospectus-18.pdfThe options are not cheaper. The notional value is different. Also, $TSLA recently moved like 10% in a single day on a bear market rally. You probably just got lucky.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 17:10:37'] I typed out something to your WSB last night but my phone died. It’s interesting that you could run the wheel on this going short. Also it’s definitely advantageous to smaller sized retail traders because like you said, puts are essentially calls. Now an ATM put is priced the same as far OTM regular TSLA calls. One could scale out far more effectively and safely with these if it the liquidity increases. It essentially opens up a new avenue for traders who may have been previously priced out of trading TSLA options directly. I’ll definitely be watching this and possibly adding to the liquidity pool if the opportunity presents itself. Thanks for bringing to my attention.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 17:22:59'] TSLA trades at $815, TSLQ trades at $43.12. An options contract represents 100 shares.Now that these basics are out of the way, let's look at an example:An ITM TSLA 8/19 $810 call is $5630 while an OTM TSLQ $43 Put is $300. Now multiply the TSLQ put price by 18.8 to account for the stock price difference and you get $5658.I rounded but it looks like they're basically valued exactly the same. There is no pricing inefficiency going on.There's also no undervaluing going on and there's no opportunity to somehow make money off the difference in the actual price difference, because the REAL price difference is negligible.Please go back to the drawing boards or better yet, stay the hell away from options because you still don't know what you're doing.All you are holding is essentially TSLA calls. If you didn't intend to just buy TSLA calls you should sell immediately and thank God TSLA went up last week.

Although there is still a chance that stock price surges, the probability should already be priced-in in the option pricing model.\n\nThe true advantage of selling put is that the margin required money can generate interests while sitting in your account and the put itself also contains the interests value. Owning stock can't generate any interests. So you earn 2x interests compared to owning stock.\n\nSo if someone want to own a stock, he should just sell the deep ITM put in high interest rates environment. Is it right?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 04:25:37'] The trade offs are pretty simple. 1) When you sell a deep ITM put vs buy shares, you forgo dividends. 2) You run the risk of the stock price going above the strike price and you not participating in the appreciation beyond your strike. The decision you make will be based on your assumption of price, what your margin requirement will be, what interest rate you can get, and whether or not those make up for the dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 08:54:34'] Extrinsic value decay is how short puts profit.  The ext value is very low deep ITM so it would make more profit to sell ATM or slightly ITM.Calculate the difference yourself as you will quickly see deep ITM has less profit potential than ATM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 04:24:20'] The problem here is if it makes sense based on interest rates to sell a very deep put (vs buying the stock), it will make sense for whoever bought it to exercise it early.  It will be trading with no extrinsic value and you would have to sell it slightly below parity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:40:12'] All components are priced into the options: carry cost, borrow rate (shorting), and dividends.    In terms of only the interest, it increases call premium and decreases put premium. There are no free lunches here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 05:58:23'] If the interest you earn carrying the premium is worth more than the call at that strike then yes.  Otherwise the price of the call is added to the premium of the deep in the money put
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:23:30'] No, because the interest rate is priced into the stock price.  If you think the stock will have an expected value price of $105 in a year, assuming no dividends, you're not paying $105 today.

Never hold a position past noon on expiration day in which your account cannot afford to hold the shares associated with your options position, if near or in the money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 19:50:19'] A $5 wide spread will have a max $500 risk, less the credit received of course, but 100 shares of a stock at $185 per share would cost $18,500 to buy.If the spread had expired with the 185 short leg ITM and the 180 long leg OTM it would have cost $18,500 in cash in your IRA to buy the 100 shares.While you say you had the full intent to close or roll the brokers risk department saw this as a $18.5K risk your account may not have been able to handle.  Because of this they closed the position to avoid being assigned the shares.If you had $18,500 in free cash available in your account then they should not have closed you out.  Since an IRA does not have margin LOANS available, and you are usually limited to the amount of cash you can deposit, this may have caused them to use more caution by closing.In summary, you only needed $500 to open the spread, but could have easily required $18,500 to buy the 100 shares.  Presuming you didn’t have that much and waited until the last hours on the expiration day to act you should not be surprised the broker closed when it was so close.\*\*Edit - Added margin loans as IRAs can have “margin” enabled to permit spreads and trading with unsettled funds, but none allow margin loans to buy shares.\*\*

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 20:23:45'] Also you could sell a June 17 745 call and get your original 5500 back. Then you would have a free roll to get the difference between your $680 long call and the $745 short call. So a free roll for $6,500.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 20:51:28'] Just checked and the option contact is currently valued 21% over intrinsic value so the 10-15% premium wouldn’t cut it

I think this guy is just lonely. First off I cannot think of any traders who would have gone in for such a short dated option, at a cost of $55. He does not say when he bought it, I am thinking 5/20-24, so this was a 5500 gamble.

Plus the delta is \~0.3 meaning even if TSLA drops to 650, you are not looking at full value, expect 10-20% gain at most. Further, if TSLA memes away to 1000, say good bye to your 25k!&#x200B;&#x200B;Disclaimer, I am currently holding 1/8 715p! :)Edit: TSLA just jumped from 735 -> 745 in 2 minutes in AH.

I am only in stock right now because it's been such a crazy run. I won't risk a bullish option for a month or 2. But to open a bearish position?!  Insane.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 13:23:16'] Tough choice. On the one hand they're overvalued by every metric invented in the history of corporate finance. On the other hand the stock keeps going up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 12:47:15'] Investing 101: if you don’t have the timing, you don’t have the trade. You need a comprehensive thesis that goes something like: “on A date, I expect B event, triggered by C catalyst, based on D research, resulting in E impact to earning power, and F impact to G multiple, resulting in H change to the share price.” Yes, that’s a lot of variables - investing isn’t easy. Anyway, if you can’t plug in ALL of those variables, you are better walking away.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:29:53'] Tesla is overvalued and has been for the larlst year. It's due for a correction but theres absolutely ZERO reason it will be any time soon. It was due a correction pre split. Or when it mooned the first 4 times. Or on sp500 introduction. There has never been a reason for it to be this high. And because of that, it means that logic won't magically kick in when you buy a put. TSLA Short sellers lost over 1bil yesterday alone. 38bil in 2020. Why would now be the time

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 15:41:53'] Not with you. I sold my TSLA shares at $662 per share thinking it was the peak. All of it. It wasn't.After the inclusion into the index, it has climbed higher to $730/share.That is easily 10% increase. So if your theory holds true, then a 10% drop is about the price I sold TSLA a few weeks ago at it's "peak" (hah).And you have theta working against you so if the timing doesn't work out and you don't hit your strike price of the put you bought.. your options expire worthless.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 12:47:04'] Well, so we know what page you're on, what is the reason you think Tesla's valuation is meritless? Have you researched the potential upside of being the dominating company in the following industries;\- Transport as a service (both manned and autonomous)\- residential, commercial and utility grade energy storage\- residential, commercial and utility grade solar (both solar panels and solar roof, which directly competes dollar for dollar with other premium tile roofing, without factoring in the solar PV panels)\- public EV charging infrastructure\- EV battery production\- rapid factory design and constructionand finally.\- Electric vehicle manufacturingIf you think you know everything they know about these industries and that they're not going to be able to keep their momentum executing these things (they're already a huge player in many of these industries) then I think you should buy as many puts as your and your margin can afford. Why not??? Surely you are very much smarter than the $38 *billion* lost betting against Tesla last year. Surely, after 10 years of fighting for every inch of progress, finally blasting forward at alarming pace, $25 *billion* cash on hand, Tesla is finally going to just stop executing and fall flat on its face.Do it. I don't think you have the guts.*edit: spelling*
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 13:19:44'] I dont think TSLA will rocket 600% again, but it might keep floating higher. People have been saying what you've been saying for years. Good luck.

Been riding tsla spreads ever since and have made a killing. Tsla stock is broken, if it does die, it will be off some terrible news, and i dont think that is happening any time soon.  TLDR- dont bet against this monster unless its a small position you’re willing to lose
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 13:33:32'] Watch a YouTube video on the cars - X or Model 3 new version and let me know if you want to bet against them. Shorts have lost 38 billion last year is what I read. That’s with a B. You’d be better off not to short but bet against a certain price by a certain date. Say buy and sell a put with a bearish position. That way you limit your downside.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 13:41:33'] So to your credit, Michael burry said he’s short TSLA. He is a pretty smart man who called the housing bubble in 08. Ive suspected for a while that TSLA is gonna have a hard pullback. But I fully expect it to recover after and soar to new highs. So play your cards carefully.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:56:47'] Get your mindset ready to lose 100% on your position. Even if it does go your direction the most likely scenario is that it will be a whiplash trade meaning you’ll lose almost all of it and if you’re right it has a probability of being a profitable trade thereafter. Even if you were to take this trade it would NOT be a good risk/reward if premiums on those contracts are high

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 17:53:43'] Not if you like your money. Any kind of bearish position on Tesla is a recipe for losing your money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 18:16:02'] Why not just short the stock if you want directional exposure? Kinda dumb to just randomly buy options if you only care about price movement. You’re making a bet on vol too
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 19:51:47'] Oh shit, please don't. First of all Tesla is still in its run, please don't short the hottest stock in the market before its topped! Second you are buying a LEAP, so you are going to be paying out the ass for it, especially since its so volatile right now. Third is that its a super expensive option. The only way you'll be profitable in this is if Tesla is BELOW 730 - 250 = 480. That is your BREAK EVEN point. So that means that in order for you to make any money on this it'll have to get BELOW 480. Since you paid 250 for it, it has to go 250 below 480 (480 - 250 = 230) for you to make 100% on your bet. So hell no you shouldn't do this. Oh and 4, even if you think Tesla is too high its hard to be against a company that is going to be growing at 50% per year. IT is pretty high but it could stagnate over 500 for 2-3 years and still be fine and you'd be fucked for 25K. This is such a bad trade. When I trade options, I try to make sure I will make 100% super easy! I think this is the opposite of that.If you think Tesla is overvalued then wait for a topping signal and look for a shorter term put, but the premium will still be very high. Just make sure that you'll be profitable at a support level if you want to do that. which may end up being 750 lol.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 19:55:29'] The amount of these posts I’ve seen the past 2 years is mind boggling. And I’m pretty sure 95% of the trades didn’t work out. (Unless scalping.)

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 13:24:34'] Tesla shorts lost more money last year the entire car industry market cap.  Wish you luck, but most people who really understand what Tesla is doing has a price target around 1500.  What they are doing if successful should easily make them worth more than Apple.  Hard to put a price valuation on driving automation(depends when they release it and if someone else makes a valid competitor soon after/before), and the energy grid utility could put them over Apple, it is possible with better battery and solar tech they could have a never ended revenue stream powering homes/businesses with the car batteries/panels.....i'd wait for at least 1000/shr before shorting personally, those new factories and their die cast printing of cars will allow Tesla to make their cars much cheaper and faster than anyone else....even in China

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 13:24:47'] How much is a contract like that trading for? $ ~350? Shorting Tesla is extremely difficult, I am having similar thoughts. But I think it should be valued at around $450 USD before they prove production facilities can keep up (Launch of European and Chinese factories). I am rather looking at a P $550 December 21, expecting the next two quarterly reports to disapoint, while some scandal involving the upcoming factories will likely also set in, in conjunction with competition catching up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 13:49:36'] Wait until a catalyst. Their time is coming but no one knows what will snap people out of it. The hard-core tesla bulls on here literally don't know what they are in so who knows when people that don't read news and make their own DD will do just that and what might spark it. Currently though there's news in Europe of tesla buying its own cars and not doing anything with them. If that turns out to be widespread maybe thats the domino that makes people notice all the other shady and fraudulent activity.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:10:50'] I think its overvalued. Would I buy a put? Nope.A Sept 2022 put is 28k... Id be willing to play a put debit spread or sell a call credit spread though. Ive made a lot of money trading it and the only time Ive ever lost is when I doubted it would go up enough.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:10:58'] Hahaha shorting Elon. Good luck
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:11:32'] You have to see the cult start to crumble. I think there are literally people who got $30k worth back in the $100 levels and just kept on buying and still not selling and buy on any dip. To top it all off the biggest owners/holders keep on buying as well and bullish still.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:13:40'] Have you ever met someone that owns a Tesla? They fucking love their cars. And always talk about wanting to buy a second one. I’ve never met anyone who is THAT in love with their car—besides every Tesla owner I know. I think you can say it’s a bubble short term (but who knows when it pops). Tesla isn’t going anywhere long term

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:18:06'] To buy options, I believe you need more than just valuation, you need an actual catalyst for which you believe will cause the stock to drop. Sure, I think it's overvalued but why do you think it will drop enough for you to make money on a put? You could be 100% right on the direction but be off on the timing and lose everything.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:19:02'] Anyone have an extra pair of those red satin shorts Elon was selling last year? Sell them to this guy for 1/4 of what he would otherwise be paying for his put. You'll both come out winners...
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:24:11'] As others have said, you are better of short selling rather than a put, and use a stop to mark the point at which you'd abandon your thesis. I've been swinging short with about 7 shares (the actual $ value of my bearish conviction).
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:27:44'] I tried doing a small hedge with $680/$685 bear call spreads at the start of December since Tesla is pretty heavy in my portfolio. I felt slightly better about myself when Tesla went down to 600, but my 50% profit target never came. Once Tesla started testing my breakeven point, I decided it wasn’t worth it to bet against Tesla. I instead flipped them to $685/$675 bull put spreads, and I’m less stressed with them now. 🤷‍♂️

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:36:49'] I’m a Tesla Super bull - have you looked at the scale of Tesla production, the demand and their margins? Have you looked at how many different industries they are not only disrupting but will wipe the floor with? From energy, automobile, autonomous driving (robo taxis + semi’s), insurance and more. They raise money for free. They print 5 bil when ever they want with less than 1% stock dilution. If you have trouble wrapping your head around the financials look at apples hardware software model - but with vertical integration. Also get a in a Tesla with FSD if you still don’t get it lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 14:38:38'] Tesla is meeting demands and building more infrastructure. Might be riding the meme tide but ultimately the justification for the valuation will eventually be met as Tesla pumps out more cars. Only way this stock will crash is if Elon Musk himself straight up dies.

In fact, we think you are not doing enough when you diluted our shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 15:28:42'] So many people have lost so much money trying to short/put Tesla. But if you’re hell bent on doing it why a September 2022 contract? You believe TSLA is due for just a correction? Or is it going to go down and stay down for the next 2 years. I personally think a correction is due but I also think that Tesla will quickly rebound. There’s just so many desperate buyers out their looking for a dip to get in. So if it’s just a correction maybe a September 2021 date.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 15:32:34'] Dude you could buy a straddle on TSLA at 9:50 most days and sell both legs for a profit before market close.Holding a put on TSLA multiple days? Dangerous.

I put on my clown socks and watch my money melt.This was me **yesterday** buddy, stock is up to new all time highs once again today though. Nothing has added 13% value to this company over the last week has it.Its part of the broader infinity loop of people thinking stocks eventually rise, so they buy any dip without looking at anything else. Same reason I don't think we will ever see another market crash like the one in 2008 again. At least not unless there is a massive climate disaster. Any big dips now will start to get bought up faster and faster imo(for the whole market not tesla specifically)

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 16:36:58'] The way things are going currently I see Tesla going up more probably and when Biden gets into presidency I’m pretty sure there is gonna be some heavy green energy movement which will affect the EV markets as well as renewable energy stocks. Sure it might seem overvalued but at this point Tesla is in its own league and not a traditional stock so to speak
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 16:41:55'] If you have a price target, sell the put instead of buying.Stock goes up? Profit. Stock remains the same? Profit. Stock goes down to your price point? Get 100 shares at a sick price. And then profit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 16:43:51'] At the moment everyone thinks the stock is untouchable.  It is a cool company, what they did is very impressive, but the auto biz is awful, so many companies cool or not have come and gone.  A big correction is due because a $700B market cap on $500 mil net income is not sustainable, but it's just played like bitcoin at this point, complete disconnection from financial reality. Trying to time puts with them is a mess, it will probably just keep bouncing around and being bought back up on the dips and frustrate the hell out of you.  Any puts farther out are so expensive for what you get that it's not worth it.  There are so many better plays out there.

I believe all new GM cars are going to be electric. The key is Tesla is making their money  on carbon credits given to them by other car companies who produce gas engines. When Ford and GM go all electric teslas credits go way down, and that’s where he’s making all his money. It’s a fools game and he knows it but he’s riding out the storm and has become the third richest person in the world with this stunt. Take away is wait until his carbon credits start to dry up, maybe a year or even two away. Lots of people when busted shorting Tesla I wouldn’t be any rush to do it

Since they can't take a trip to the Bahamas or go to a show they're putting it in to TSLA, because... you know, TSLA goes up.I believe the market is going to go down as things open back up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 17:57:37'] Never short a stock because you think it’s overvalued. I see way too many traders try to fade something thats been on a monster run and get burned. Just a personal opinion, but shorting or buying puts at all time highs is asking for trouble. My suggestion: look at the charts and a few momentum indicators and look for an entry. For the highest probability of success you want to catch the continuation of a downtrend. Don’t try to time the top.If you do pull the trigger dont buy OTM naked puts. Buy a put spread to limit your risk. I like to buy the 60 deltas and sell the 40s when I do debit spreads.Full disclosure...I’ve made a killing selling puts on Tesla and I will happily sell you some ;)
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 18:07:00'] I don’t mean to be mean but honestly probablyWorst thing to do is do a PUT on Tesla. Not saying because I’m a Tesla bag holder but this a company that has much more room to go in the coming 5 years. More and more gigafactories and cars to be released and their battery technology is just going to get better and better along with their full self driving.Edit: Also, superchargers are such an advantage for Tesla over the competition.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 20:13:38'] I think using data from this past year for a stock such as TESLA for a long term put isent the best... remember back in early 2020 before COVID they went from like $400 to over $1,000 over night... that is the kind of volatility that we are dealing with. It is for that main reason that I typically won't set a call or a put out longer than a few months. Do I think it will go down by a large amount? Yea, they have been on a decent upswing and the greeks are in favor of a put call. But I would not make it so far out, at that point you are just paying for extra time that I don't think you will need 😃 but very interesting question!
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 20:18:45'] It's a good bet. Market due for a pullback. Especially stocks like tsla. Everyone buying on margin means any kind of decent pullback could trigger a massive sell-off.

Apple still has lots of growth to go in un tapped markets such as Africa, India, and continued growth in China as the world develops more into a high tech society.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 19:52:17'] small loss is when you get out in the beginning, nothing to me makes sense to keep chasing a bigger and bigger loss. I have learnt to take a loss and fel bad for a day than to be chasing a ever growing loss and be miserable every day. Play within your limits and take delivery or the loss and get out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 21:40:15'] Seems you just got 4 good reasons why that's not a good strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 19:40:06'] I will say you will need to tie up capital , and keep building up the capital requirements for a long time if you have to keep rolling  , and pray it pulls up to break even on the trade! This is when a good trader will know to just cut losses or keep throwing money at the problem, which can help sometimes!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 21:48:52'] Just close it and book the loss.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 23:16:59'] You sold a 150 put. TSLA trades at 172. It expires 4/21.  It’s 3/10. There is no way I would close the trade today for $6. I would look at it again in April.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 20:07:47'] If it goes down far enough fast enough, and you keep rolling, it can reach the point where there is no longer room to roll down for a credit.  And if that happens, you won't be able to keep it OTM, and if it's deep ITM, you risk early assignment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 09:58:18'] Other replies have addressed the mechanical reasons why infinite rolling will eventually hit a wall. I'd like to address the mindset problem.Being an average, humble trader that just wants a decent trade "once and a while," doesn't require optimizing the hell out of every trade. But "doesn't require" isn't the same thing as "blindly ignore," let alone "intentionally make bad decisions."  Focusing on the outcome of a single trade is a very bad habit for any trader. It can lead to [results-oriented thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/) as well as [loss aversion bias](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/content/loss-aversion-bias) and chasing profits at any cost.So my problem with the idea of rolling that one trade until it finally wins is that it misses the forest for the trees. A better mindset is to be indifferent to the outcome of a single trade and focus more on your average results over many trades. Over 100 would be good. Over 1000 would be better. Over 10,000 would be great. Averages are what matter. Averages are how you converge on the expected value you planned for and targeted. Averages are what separate profitable traders from one-hit wonders.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 00:37:34'] I’ll roll forever. I never take on a position that would result in a 2.5% loss if assigned and price goes to 0 or doubles. So if I have to roll out for credit, whatever. Time will catch up to it and I’ll roll again if I have to for even more credit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 14:44:01'] I think it's important to note that rolling indefinitely doesn't really exist. Can we roll for a long time, absolutely. But it's important to understand the math behind each roll: [https://youtu.be/YwF5YXKijDo](https://youtu.be/YwF5YXKijDo)In short, each time we roll, (assuming we're closing at a loss and re-opening a trade), we slowly erode our account value, even if we're receiving a credit. So our net liq decreases even as our cash and sweep increases.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 22:26:23'] You should only do this if you are happy with a large TSLA delta position during the coming months (and if you have deep pockets). Be sure to roll down and out (in time) when volatility pops.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 00:19:48'] I'd rather take the L and live to trade another day.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 07:10:27'] If the underlying keeps moving lower, there is a level where rolling doesn’t help much. There are many recent examples. Someone that sold puts on something like PLTR when it was 30 may have been able to roll for credit when it declined to 20. However when the decline continued to 7 it would have been hard to impossible to stay at a credit. There is also tying up capital both money and mental energy. Gap moves can be especially difficult situations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 00:32:01'] Just stick to your plan. Because at the end of the day it is your money and you will regret it if you lose or miss the big win.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 05:08:43'] Dude, I'm rolling a $47 LCID put. Yes, it ties up capital. If you can afford it, who cares, roll and get premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 05:12:28'] Sometimes it is more efficient to take the static deltas of the shares as you fully participate in the moves up... but you risk you take the 100 deltas down, if the stock drops further. It is always about what makes sense. For instance, if I sold a put for 0.90$ and to roll 30-60 days out I can't get more than 0.2, then I would rather let myself be assigned (if I like the price) or take the loss.There is also the variant of taking the loss partially by rolling down and in, effectively buying some of the intrinsic with the premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 06:29:01'] This is how I "roll" (pun intended) - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/lliy8x/rolling\_short\_puts\_to\_avoid\_assignment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/lliy8x/rolling_short_puts_to_avoid_assignment/)I'll add two things.  Keep in mind that provided the stock is above the strike price the trade will start to profit at some point.  There should be no rush to roll if the option is not ATM or ITM.  With TSLA around $172 your Apr 150 put is not at risk right now.  You don't include the credit you got, but calculating the breakeven price including that credit will find the BEP somewhere around $145.  The other thing is that rolling can be very helpful but can also move the trade out in time to keep it open longer that can reduce the profit per day.  I prefer trades that do not get challenged and just close for a 50% profit, so I like to get out of these problem trades as soon as possible and not let them hang around too long.  You opened this trade around the 45 dte so it might not profit until opened for 10 or more days.  Be patient and it is possible to mess up what would be a good profitable trade by adjusting too soon rather than let it work . . .
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 07:12:02'] You didn't state your objectives but I would usually take the assignment and sell the call in preference to rolling the put.   Sell the call at a strike reflective of how much you want to hold TSLA.   50 deltas to dump it, 30 deltas if you like it, and 10 deltas if you love it.NOTE: If you get really hammered you might not be selling anything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 10:42:23'] I do this strategy as a side hustle, except OTM for 6 months out or more, and I go opposite the overall sentiment (sentiment is bearish, so I’m doing calls on certain securities). I haven’t been doing it long enough to tell for sure if it’s profitable, but if it works, I’ll post it here. I imagine that it’s emotions and fomo that keeps people who don’t do this from doing this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 11:37:57'] "Infinite" rolling might be ok with ETF options like spy, qqq and iwm (if you suffer from loss aversion like me), but if stocks are considered, take the loss and go on. Some stocks might be trash forever and it might get worse and you might get eg 0,05$ premium for a leap (made the experience at my first days)For stock options, I close the position at +100% option value.

You didn't sell for what the contract is worth now, but you are still likely to profit if you wait until April.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-17 21:55:58'] I'm surprised nothing here reflects what's going on in China.Should US markets not have any reason for concern for Evergrande defaulting (23 Oct)?IMO, defaulting will begin a domino affect with others like it which will definitely affect the markets.  Yet, again, I don't see many too concerned about this.  Am I missing something?

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-18 09:20:08'] Chipotle is a Bill Ackman scam pump by his paid analysts.  Chipotle only just got back to the same per store sales # last quarter as it did in 2019, with 2500 stores then and near 2870 stores now.  But the stock price rallied from $830 to $1830, more than double for just getting back to 2019's per store sales. Higher menu prices now, along with higher wages, and acute staffing issues including problems in retaining/hiring employees.Chipotle is the biggest SCAM since Enron.  Chipotle owes some $150 mil in back pay to NYC employees alone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 13:41:40'] If I recall correctly, sometime last year TSLA traded flat for months, took a sharp decline, and then took off.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 18:58:23'] I just started looking into option strategies. I seen what you call as a long  condor spread with calls. For GOOG I seen that I can make $900 max profit  spending only $60. I set it to sell two calls at $2770 and $2780 and bought two at $2760 and $ 2790. I know this is risky because of the possibility of getting assigned but how risky and how likely am I to get assigned and would the calls I bought cover it?

POST_TEXT: b"I currently have a risk free play on. I bought 4/6 $190 Tesla put for 11.25 yesterday around noon. The price fell and I converted it into a spread by selling the 4/6 $185 put for $11.40. So I'm in a risk free situation from what I see. was turning into a spread a mistake? Should I have just cashed out instead?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 07:19:20'] Not necessarily a mistake per se, but you did cap your gains.  I'm looking at the option chain.  If you cashed out the long put right now by itself you would've made $560.  The most you can get from this trade in total if it's totally ITM by 04/06 is $515.The good part is that you can't lose money.  The worst that happens is that the spread is OTM, expires worthless, and you made $15 anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:09:47'] Dude, it all depends on what you expectation is. If you think TSLA is gonna go down and the spread will be in the money, then keep it on. If you think TSLA is going to go up and the spread will be worthless, sell the spread. I don’t understand these kinds of questions. You’re currently short TSLA. If you want to be short TSLA keep the position, if you don’t, sell it. It’s really that simple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:11:39'] But since you're here, and TSLA is having a crappy day you can leg it into a fly and maybe squeeze another couple bucks out of it, as of right now.Look at selling **another** 4/6 185 put, and buying 1x $180 put - it's mid-priced at **$2.45** atm.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 10:10:41'] Already explained perfectly in the other reply, but it's worth repeating: A "risk free" position also can't gain more reward. If you lock out risk, you lock out additional gains as well. You can't have it both ways.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 12:18:51'] Sounds like we have the same teacher,lol. If we do, then you should know as we try to reach our 1 to 2 risk/rewards minimum(big gains)! If you first trigger seq on your spread at the target, then take the money ! We use the spread when we think a reversal is coming to lock in the gains! We then have a few options! Lattering your puts as taking some of the gains and buying more to  have unlimited gain again but lesser risk! If it keeps going down , we can turn it into a condor! Right now, theta is eating you up and growing. After each passing day, I may would put an alert on the stock to see if it keeps going, then buy another put contract longer expiration, or see what to do!

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 14:39:13'] Not a mistake, especially compared to some of the crazy questions we see on reddit.However,  it technically wasn't free because at the time you sold the 185 put, you could have sold the 190 put for a profit.  That opportunity cost was the price of entering into this trade.  Now, your net payoff is from $0.15 to $5.15 depending on where it settles, assuming you hold to 4/6 expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:38:22'] Depending on how long you were intending to hold the put, you may consider a diagonal spread in the future. You’re long a 4/6 put, maybe sell a 3/10 or 3/17 at a lower strike. You may need to manage the short leg by rolling down and into the future, but if you can get a credit on the roll it can work for you. The opportunity cost is if TSLA drops a ton you miss out on the long leg profit and depending on how close you write these can potentially turn into loss scenarios, so you’d need to pick a strike that puts you in at least a break even scenario if the short leg somehow goes deep ITM. Really the risk is if you can’t get any week-to-week premium on the roll because it’s too deep ITM. Or if TSLA shoots up of course.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 17:50:43'] TSLA is one of those stocks that can make large moves up or down.  For this reason, I don't like to sell the same expiration options to turn into spreads.  I like to sell a front expiration week and a lower strike (diagonal spread) so that I can move the strike lower on the following week should TSLA continue its move down and continue to capture profits on the downside.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 23:55:33'] Yes, you should have just cashed out the 190 put. Now, if TSLA keeps falling your gain is capped. If TSLA goes up to 210 your puts are worthless, but you made $15 by selling the 185 put. So, by selling the 190 put you would have made and kept the profit from your long put. So now, there is little additional gain possible, but you can lose almost all your profit. And, you have to think about the position all the time, and worry that TSLA will rebound up. If I were you I'd just sell both options and get out of the trade with a profit, and do something else with the money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 06:46:24'] Dude by selling that put you just made $15, if it expires OTM, I don’t know what you’re excited about here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 13:02:20'] How much was your 190 put worth when you sold the 185?  Let's say it was worth $2 or $3 more than you bought it for. You are essentially risking that profit against your ability to make a bit more than $5 if it TSLA closes below 185 or make a tiny bit if it goes against you. It isn't inherently right or wrong, but need to consider the money you could have banked immediately against your new risk and reward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 17:20:25'] update on this if anyone comes byI turned it into a fly as suggested below and sold today. was close to max profit on this. i think that there was some opportunity loss but trade went well.

If the CPI comes in hot Thursday you can flush the gamma squeeze in the toilet - if TSLA breaks  down through 100 it drags the entire market with it . China announced a form of Covid that breaks through the vaccine BA.115 . 43% now in new US cases - here already - flush the toilets again . It’s all perception- perception right now and for the most of 2023 is one of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Inflation , terminal rate  and for how long - margin and demand destruction , slumping retail and consumer, rising personal and national debt, exit multiple and terminal values , Ukraine , oil and energy it’s endless. For this to turn gamma positive and accent to the upside , all of the aforementioned must subside significantly. It’s all about perception It's all about bucks, kid. The rest is conversation.It's not a question of enough, pal. It's a Zero Sum game - somebody wins, somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply, transferred - from one perception to another. Like magic.This painting here?

I think it may get a small bounce tomorrow and give a good entry.  It sure has nice premium in the options and if it settles down and trades sideways a seller of this premium would be in great shape. I see the premium quite low on MTN options as this stock did not really sell off and earnings are coming up. Trades at quite a multiple for a company that is really not growth. High institutional ownership and may be part of the re.balancing we are seeing of late. When all the funds own the same name and join together to bid it up. How will it work if they all want out at the same time. May sell off on a good or bad earnings report imo.

POST_TEXT: b"**Market Volatility**\n\nLast week the major indices rallied to new highs. Options were pricing in about a 2% move last week and the SPY climbed by nearly 3%. With that, option volatility, as measured by the VIX settled near 20 to close the week.\n\nAt the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **1.5%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $388 to the downside and $400 on the upside. Here's how that 1.5% expected move compares to this week's expected moves in QQQ and IWM:\n\n**QQQ 2.6%IWM 2.4%**\n\nAs I mentioned, the VIX closed lower on the week, near 20 Friday. Again, that wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. If one is trading pure IV out a month or more being short vol would have worked, but if one was trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... the VIX or individual stock IV is less important if the stock makes a large one-way move higher.\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** made a big move higher, helping to take the indices t"

POST_TEXT: b'Hi so I have a Tesla Put expiring tomorrow but Ive hit my 3 day trade limit and dont wanna get flagged as a PDT.. is there any way I can sell the contract without violating the PDT?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 12:52:54'] Depending on moneyness you could consider selling a closely struck put. If you expect your long to expire deep ITM then they both would effectively cancel out during assignment and it would be similar to closing the long today.For example, let's say a stock is at 100 and you're long the 120 put, so it's worth \~$20.If you sell the 119 put, you'd probably get \~$19 for it (although likely less given liquidity). Then, when both puts get assigned you'd be selling the underlying for 120 while simultaneously buying it for 119, producing a credit of $1. Combined with the \~$19 from the sale of the 119 put you'd have effectively locked in the gain you'd have gotten by selling today.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 13:16:06'] Wait??  You opened the trade in prior days or today?  If prior days then it won't be a day trade if you close today.If you opened today then close in tomorrow morning when it also won't be a day trade.  If you have >$25K in your account then you can make the trade without any restrictions.  This really isn't that complex to make an help urgently post . . .
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 20:36:24'] When people in this thread said that you are going to get 90 days ban if you're flagged as PDT, it means that you won't be able to do day trades only.   You still be able to trade with multiple days. I had been flagged with PDT, not a big deal. Just change your strategy a bit , buy longer dated options, buy them at the end of the day , and so on. What tripped me was that I was trading spreads and each leg was counted as a trade, maybe because I split them when I close.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 12:36:11'] Wait until tomorrow. Lose them. Get 25k in there. Some apps give you a one time forgiveness. Tesla puts are printing currently

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 02:02:10'] You have a lot of great answers but plainly, for it to be considered day trading…the trade, start from finish, has to be on the same day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 13:14:03'] Sell the same expiration at a different price. Or sell the same strike at a different expiration. Lots of ways to solve this (most aren’t perfect, but will reduce your risk substantially).
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 13:21:04'] Technically if it expires tomorrow you must close it they will not hit you with a pdt, as the contract expires . If they did you could appeal it and win
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 15:53:06'] The only way to flatten your position and avoid PDT is to box it off (in the same expiration) and close out the next day. You have a long put, so STO the next strike put further OTM. Now you have a put debit spread. Next step is to sell the corresponding call credit spread to make your P&L diagram a flat line, locking in your profits. egBTO 120pthenSTO 119pthenSTO 120cBTO 119c

It can take up to 24 hrs though.Also, if you sell it tomorrow it doesn’t count as a round-trip day trade. So based on this, nothing to worry about. Now if you purchase an option in the morning and sell it before closing bell then it’ll count as another day trade and trigger PDT flag.

I rolled it  like crazy,  ended up with a contract on 2023 thinking that I would have time for it to recover.Good assigned at 160 in  july lol.In the end was better to have the stocks earlier, at least I could sell aggressive CCs / collars / covered strangles and reduce my cost. My total loss in the moment is 6k.I think it's quite possible to have it happening in your case as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:23:48'] If the pro's  exercise these puts early is basically an interest rate calculation.  If they exercise their puts and buy the corresponding calls, they will have synthetically the same position.If they exercise, they get short stock (this creates a credit balance which they receive interest on) and they no longer pay (or not receive the interest on the price of the puts.  If this carry cost/benefit is more than the corresponding calls, you are at risk of early assignment.When this is the case, there will be no extrinsic value left in the puts.  As mentioned by another poster, there is currently about 3 points of extrinsic value in the puts, so not likely just yet.  As time goes on, this extrinsic value will disappear.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:50:27'] Your odds are pretty good. Of being assigned. What exactly- who knows - but ur honestly probably eating shit on this. Happens to all of us man. I've been early assigned the dumbest things. Hopefully you're not destroyed by the position. I remember closing PTON puts out for 5k loss/per contract when it hit 120ish.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 15:28:51'] Who cares about early assignment? Guessing those puts are 100 delta each right now.  So getting assigned really changes nothing unless you would have to use margin to afford the shares. Sell calls against the puts or something imo. But either way you should have cut the position a long time ago.  Also, fwiw, selling 2024 expiry naked options makes very little sense.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 05:59:02'] If it’s any consolation, I sold $300 puts and rolled it out repeatedly until I got assigned. You will get assigned sooner or later when the opposite side believes it’s time to get out of their short. Take it as a slight bullish signal if you do because your stock is likely to go back up (though a far cry from $226).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:35:52'] You sold TSLA puts at 226 - you sold them some one bought them - whoever has the contract on the long side is waiting to see how far down this goes . There is a TSLA report on Q4 22 sales due out Jan 4. The smart money says they miss the analysts number by at least 15,000 cars . Not good . The bank has a margin on TSLA 13 billion dollar loan to fund TWTR - the lower TSLA goes the more stock gets sold on margin . I just read the Shanghai plant is closed. TSLA earnings comes out Jan 25 th . They will probably scrape by on top and bottom line. All eyes will be on the guidance . What can Musk say positive ? A share buyback . Musk is a cagey shrewd businessman. He might want to deflate shares making a buyback cheaper , and calling in more shares. A reverse dilution makes his shares worth more - less in the market to buy . Driving the price up could be a result of that . Of course TSLA in its present state might not have the free cash flow to buy back 10-15 billion right now . They didn’t have it to buy TWTR . Their brand is wrecked right now , Musk is distracted with TWTR. No one is flying the TSLA plane it’s on autopilot. Your problem is : (1) As soon as the stock significantly rises on an announcement the holder of the long put will sell  . That will lead to an assignment . (2) As of closing you are -103.00 per share in the red , the difference between your strike and the price . Each option you sold is - 10,300 at present . If you only secured the put with 10,000 - the exchange house will sell off 300 from your equity account - at that point they may close you out of the trade as your debit exceeded the CCP. Or , you can give them more money and hope that TSLA will go back up - but what if it dips to 90? Another 30 points is about 3000 per option more of your money gone. Chances are as soon as the stock goes up 5-10 points you will be assigned and lose between 9000-10000 per option written

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 12:48:07'] Isn't VIX all screwed up since last April when CBOE started listing SPX options expiring every trading day?  Probably way more volume for the near term versus next term expirations now compared to when they last updated the calculation back in 2003 right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 08:32:16'] GEX prints have been close to the 2B-3B range hence the bulls holding the control as of late.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 09:29:55'] It's evident the vix is very much being manipulated with insane moves being met with very very little move in iv. As soon as market makers start to drop their hedges on an uptick in iv and a downtrend in price you will see a potential very fast collapse. Market makers and anyone that sold naked calls are fucked right now. Market makers never hedge perfectly and this is likely what we are seeing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 02:09:41'] earnings is always a crapshoot. But I am looking closely at tsla, as it has been holding up well in this market chop fest. If we do resolve this chop to the upside, I think there's a good chance we see tsla take off. the chips and AI plays are extended, aapl is aapl, the remaining high beta megacap that's acting as safe haven from the regional bank crisis that hasn't left the station are tsla and amzn. Last week, it formed a consolidation range around the 20d MA, which I will use as my risk. If it goes up, you have both delta and IV working for you going into earnings, but I'd probably take profit on most into earnings, and perhaps sell some higher strike contracts if I do end up holding into earnings.I also think it's a mistake to look at open interest in that manner. you don't know whether those are bought or sold, part of a spread, covered call or hedge against a short. it's a roadmap to nowhere.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 19:06:11'] I am betting on TSLA on the next earnings call, but not that far out. Although I think it is completely possible for TSLA to make new ATH this year. Its revenue and profit growth is solid with a really low P/E ratio given past metrics and other stocks with similar growth. If TSLA can deliver record profits it will send a strong message to the market and fix its current evaluation. I hold massive amounts of TSLA shares in my tax free account, but as always me trading TSLA vs me investing in TSLA are 2 totally different things. I taken short positions on TSLA several times on my trading account.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 12:43:23'] I'm new-ish to options, so I tried running a straddle scenario through the numbers last night for Tesla's earnings day. My conclusion was that it would take an out-of-the-ordinary move in response to the earnings report to make a straddle likely to profit. All data, unless otherwise noted, was taken from E-Trade around 23:00hrs Eastern last night. Here's my math:* Price at close on 23 Jan  = $144.75* Max earnings move in last 6 quarters was 12% ($17.37 if closing price on 23Jan is used)* The premium for a $145 strike contract (1 put and 1 call) was $13.65 (or 9.43% of the close price of 23Jan) ... but I didn't note down when the contract expiration was for this. If I had to guess, I think it was the next monthly.* The underlying price would have to move above $158.40 or below $131.10 to be ITMGiven the premium would require a move over 9% to be ITM, and the largest recent earnings moves were 12%, this was unlikely to be a winning play.If there was more information available, maybe one would have more confidence in the move. TSLA being a volatile mess, I don't have the funds to risk just based on the above.... this is where someone points out my simple math mistakes, probably.

POST: ['2020-07-02 16:06:27'] POST TITLE: b'Tesla Infinity Call Gamma Squeeze'
POST_TEXT: b'So Ive had this hypothesis for a while now, and Im almost certain it is whats happening. Obviously I dont have all the data in front of me and I only have the observed data, but I can infer that essentially Tesla every few months will undergone an infinity call gamma squeeze that will keep pumping the stock up. Theres been some talk on Twitter about this if you just like search TSLA gamma, squeeze, etc. so Im not the only one to observe this. \n\nIf you are familiar with the famous Volkswagen squeeze, its similar, but the key difference is instead of it being a short term squeeze, this one seems to be a more drawn out squeeze that occurs every few months. So the reason its notable is that Tesla holds some interesting characteristics. First, its call skew in options sometimes is MUCH HIGHER than its put skew. This is unique. Very rarely do you see companies where the call skew is much higher than its put skew. Option demand is usually on the downside for protection for big fun'
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 17:34:20'] Flashbacks to when I was looking at Tesla 1200 weekly calls a few days ago for 0.36 each and said “Nah, I don’t want to throw away my money.” Saw the flow coming in on cheddar flow, knew the news was likely good, and I still hesitated. Those were $17 each at one point when I checked them 2 days later. I need to be bitch slapped.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 19:09:53'] >Someone starts by buying way OTM calls > force market makers to buy stock to hedge calls initially,Someone please explain this to me. Recently, an option course I took with TDAmeritrade has a multi-choice quiz question that  asks about the roles of market makers. One choice given is "to take the other side of the option trades" and another choice given is "to match buyers with sellers."  It says the former is incorrect and the latter is correct. I had to re-take the entire 30-question quiz in order to achieve my 100% score because I got that question wrong. It ingrains in me that market makers do not have to take the opposite side of options trades. Seriously, if EVERYONE on earth wants to buy OTM calls and nobody wants to be the seller, can those calls still be purchased?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 19:20:53'] The rule of investing is to never sell naked calls on TSLA, period. I just did 1885 short call 7/2 for 15 bucks on Monday, and only because it was a shortened week and I figured a 80% weekly gain was a touch much even for TSLA

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 22:11:16'] The fact that almost all of the price movement happens after hours sort of invalidates this.  But if it is option gamma it would explain a lot of crap in the market lately.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 21:01:56'] You can actually track the (edit: the presumed) gamma flip points (where MMs have to start buying/selling against their “preferred” direction to cover leading to the feedback loop) for certain tickers here: http://stocks.tradingvolatility.net/gexDashboardNote, I don’t know exactly how useful it is, ie, I’m not exactly sure how accurate the given prices are in terms of like if it crosses that point you get the infinite call loop.This is a real phenomenon, and it doesn’t just happen to TSLA, it’s why even relatively normal stocks can seemingly have short squeezes. TSLA is likely just even more prone to it for reasons you mention.Here’s the explanation on how they derive and use those “GEX Flip Points” if you can’t find it: http://www.tradingvolatility.net/2019/09/new-tool-for-identifying-stocks-ready.html
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-03 06:39:41'] Once the calls expire wouldn't MMs dump the stock they bought to hedge? And the stock that got called away, wouldn't that be sold as well?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 07:01:43'] It's still amazing how options-dominated TSLA can be, even towards open and close with a little institutional push.Earnings were yesterday. TSLA opened down at 856. Every call strike 900 and lower was up in the first eleven minutes. 20MM monthly calls in a 80-strike window were traded 9:49 - 9:50, plenty closing.Just a little news break at the right time to push through that consolidation from the 880C weeklies. 900Cs will probably have traded 100k by the time I finish editing this. What a massacre.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 22:08:07'] Can this happen sure. Is a higher call skew rare with a high short interest stock, yes. Is this price action solely due to the gamma effect on calls, no. You can buy positive gamma in many forms and market makers are always looking for the cheapest way to hedge. Granted I know nothing but I’d guess for a high vol stock like Tesla I’d be willing to bet the cheapest hedge for gamma with the smallest risk would be the options themselves. These MMs would hate to be delta neutral and see there gamma swing on a elon tweet at 2am. Usually delta hedging will come in the form of working the actual spreads in the gamma hedging themselves. Again I’m just throwing it out there
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 23:53:12'] Good thesis and it definitely makes sense. This was definitely the case when everyone was fomo’ing in pre covid, and probably still the case now. That and the algos trade TSLA pretty aggressively too it seems. It’s been a money printer the past 6-8 months.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-05 10:08:32'] Thank you for posting this. This seems very logical to me (and is extremely interesting). Even if your hypothesis isn’t correct, it’s posts like this that help the community and why I love having a forum to share ideas.If you don’t mind me asking, what are your positions here (and otherwise)?I’ve been thinking recently about the wave of attention towards SPACs and wondering if we’ll see a delta hedge / gamma squeeze on SHLL in July even though the merger isn’t until Sept/Oct. SHLL seems to be the consensus high-upside SPAC across r/SPACs and WSB and the options chain just got listed on Thursday so it’ll only garner more interest short-term. More brokers will add SHLL to platform and options volume will pick up. We saw unusual call volume on SHLL on Thursday for the October strikes even through the market hasn’t had much time to figure out the market price for calls. It’s also possible that a headwind was cleared on Nikola on Thursday, given the warrant lock-up cleared 7/3, so shares staying flat or going up should further help SHLL. It seems very likely MMs will need to delta hedge SHLL options by buying shares in large volume very soon; combined with increasing retail interest I could see this only picking up more. I only own a small amount of warrants but I’m very interested in this short/medium term mostly because of the fact that options on SPACs seem to be nonexistent until DKNG/NKLA/FMCI and I’m wondering if hype + added chain will cause this to pop quickly even though the merger isn’t until late Q3. I could certainly be overestimating the ability for this to run pre-merger, or the impact that added options have on price, but interested in this one.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 20:09:42'] Good post, don’t disagree. Just here to say options deltas aren’t trading at more than share deltas, whatever that means. Stock delta is 100, brother - Natenberg could be a worthy pick up

Also how many people do you know that own a Tesla? Or even use Tesla tech?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-03 11:47:06'] If the skew is so lopsided on the calls, why would shorts keep shorting and not buy puts? Especially if they keep losing anyway since the stock is going to “infinity”.Not questioning your theory (yet) - just curious why the shorts don’t/haven’t moved to puts if they are relatively ‘cheap’ and subsequently level out the skew - or even spreading instead of shorting if the put IV is still high.

I got a lot of questions on that post and wanted to go into a bit more detail about what it all means and what comes next.\n\nRefresher TLDR: A ton of retail flow is buying upside calls in high flying stocks and that creates short gamma for the sell side/ market makers. As the stocks go higher more and more stock needs to be bought to cover for the increasing short deltas created by that short gamma.\n\nGME was a hilarious example on Friday as it ran out of strikes on Friday's expiration and the MM's had essentially covered their short gamma for that day and the stock topped out and pulled back after that happened.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 08:34:00'] Not trying to hate since your posts are really helpful, but your Tesla example is due to it having earnings this week, which pushes up OTM call skew. Basically, people think if it moves this week (which it will), you will see a jump type of move as it’s unlikely to be like a 2-3% type of move where that 850-900 call spread looks good.That’s why you end up seeing some things like the 850-900 costing the same as just the 900 due to jump risk. But with that said, I actually think the (put or call) spreads are better for this particular earnings.

There are so many people momentum trading. I personally go long with spreads on companies with strong fundamentals or indexes like QQQ/SPY. Yes returns are capped and growth may be less than "to da moon". Time in the market beats timing the market. The longer your investment timeline the harder it is to continue to outperform the market. Modest returns consistently can still make you very wealthy. You just have to have discipline and an actual strategy. The gamblers will go big or go home.

Once stocks stop going up and calls start expiring worthless, money will move into value from tech and the bubble will pop.If this gamma squeeze is real, then as prices decrease brokers will unwind their positions as hedging is unnecessary against a sea of calls that will all expire worthless.Stocks fall like a rock and the robinhood crowd gets margin called.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-03 02:41:29'] Options are convex, which means the return is non-linear wrt move in the underlying. This non-linearity will change with time to expiration, proximity of underlying price to strike price, and market demand for the option.Options also decay, which means all else equal, they will lose value over time. There are other non-linear characteristics of options, but just these two should tell you that it's not enough -- not nearly enough -- to be right about direction of the underlying.As a result, it's not possible to answer your question as asked - there is no one optimal solution, it depends on many factors: you need to explain what you expected the underlying to do (quantitatively) once you held the option, as well as how long you thought it would take, and finally, what you think market demand for these options will be over the course of your trade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:56:12'] Buddy, did you bother to learn anything? I’m talking about IV, volume, the Greeks; can you understand and read indicators, what about candlesticks? There is a lot you NEED to understand fully to become profitable,that takes practice, patience, tolerance, and STUDYING. There’s a lot of nuance to options trading, it’s not so black and white. Can you tell me what the delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho mean? What they show? Can you understand implied volatility, and how volatility can effect your options? These are just very, very basic questions you should be able to answer before you start trading options. You should be focused on trading stock and profit from that consistently before moving onto options. DO NOT LISTEN to YOLO retards, .01% of them actually profit, the rest are forever posting loss porn. You need to learn basic TA and basic options TA.There’s a way to make that 15k back, just study and be patient. Don’t touch options until you’ve learned how to understand them.

I made worse mistakes at that age. Losing irreplaceable life long friends is far worse than losing money. Be thankful you have that much money at that age. You’re still ahead of of 99% of 20 year olds. On average the human brain doesn’t develop fully until age 25. I was always told this around your age but you can’t really comprehend what that truly means until you age and develop. If you must keep trading just sell far OTM puts on high quality stocks and take it easy. Don’t try to make it back quick or you’re most likely going to incur more losses. Use this boring trading style to study where you went wrong. If it was directional bets, learn more about the Greeks and how to exploit their variables to your advantage. Hang in there, psychological toughness and emotional control are necessities for the market and like anything- they don’t come easy. The fresh pain your feeling is usually part of that process of developing them. The most important takeaway should be there is more to life than money, and that you have your whole life ahead of you. You’re not required to trade and there’s no shame in walking away from something most fail at. Trading will always be there. Your youth won’t. Enjoy being a 20 year old that’s not held back by financial restrictions. You can still afford to take someone out for a date at any restaurant you want or whatever else fun you can dream up with that amount of money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 10:31:32'] Cut back on position sizes immensely (trade no more than $500-1000 at a time), trade only SPY/SPX or QQQ, and trade only during distribution phases or market moving events.For example, we have spent about 3 weeks in an accumulation phase across the major indices, so it is very hard to play directionally. We are likely to come out of it soon as we move into earnings season, so there is probably going to be a good setup for a 2-3 week play. There is also an argument to be made for taking a month-long strangle and trying for a multiple hundred %er on the winning leg if we rally or plummet. You can also just play the big days like CPI. If you took a 0dte strangle at open on the last 3 you would have made several hundred percent by close. My point is you can't just fire off randomly at any old stock cuz you'll get your ass kicked since the liquidity is worse (meaning the bid-ask spread is worse) and you are more susceptible to unpredictable news events. Play the major indices (SPY and QQQ) and play the major levels. We are holding 3600 on SPX for a reason, hence the mega rally on CPI last Thursday

Your investments will most likely continue to drop. If you can’t stomach the losses, just sit in cash until the market levels off and start to gain again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:21:21'] You are only 20 years old!!!! "Life Savings"?!?!?! Dude you haven't been "saving" for that long. If you were able to "save" 30k from your job in \[however many years you've been working\] then 15k is going to be a drop in the bucket. I get being super depressed - you had high expectations and they fell short. It happens in life - not just investing. But, come on... Get over it.  (I'd tell you to go have a beer, but you're not old enough!)When I was 20 - I was accumulating student debt on a diet of ramen while balancing school and work just to be able to pay rent on my shitty apartment with two degenerates I didn't even know... I was putting away 20 dollars a month! You're going to have bigger setbacks in life than this.... Hang in there and be strong. Take a break if you need it. Put a little bit away every month. Check back in when you're 30. You'll still have a solid 35 years to adjust before you retire.

A few people at my age lost it all in stock market.Wish you the best.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:40:05'] Risk management. Define how much is an acceptable loss for you, and stick to the plan. It's 100% guaranteed that at some point you will loose. Even in the majority of the cases. But it will prevent a wipeout and the idea is getting wins to cover and give you profit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:46:30'] 15K in savings at 20YR is still incredible. Assuming you’re debt free as well.I worked my way through college and wasn’t credit card debt free until 26-28 and didn’t pay off my last college loan until my 30’s. Also, I finished undergrad just before 9/11 and the 2000 dot com crash. Best thing I ever did was set aside 10% of my income into Buy & Hold companies that I liked.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:51:35'] Did something similar a few years ago. We are all human. Just expensive lessons. Invest for the long haul.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:05:25'] You’re 20 years old. 15k is nothing. I know that from your perspective it’s a shit ton of money but it’s not. My advice is: leave the markets for 5-10 years. Use the remaining 15k to: pay for education, pay for something fun, pay down debt, etc. After 5-10 years once you have a solid nest egg. Return to the markets but smarter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:07:57'] Once you realize how small 15k is you’ll feel much better, you can make 15k pulling some overtime within a year, don’t sweat it. Get that full time job and soldier on. I’ve lost probably 17k but it’s only with money I can afford. You’ll be just fine. If you do index funds you’ll be a millionaire before 48
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:14:09'] When you have a long streak of losing money, say a week or so of a bunch of trades but the win-loss rate is less than 60%, it’s time to take a step back to your practice platform and figure out where you’re going wrong. Thinkorswim’s Papermoney is a great way to evaluate strategies. Track your trades in a spreadsheet or database. Doing this over a couple of years really helped me figure out which strategies to focus on and which ones either needed to be cut or I needed help with.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:14:42'] That 15k you lost, think of it as tuition paid to learn about the stock market. You’re young and 15k honestly isn’t that bad, you’ll be fine. Learn from your mistakes and apply them to your new trades

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 09:16:36'] You're not a failure, you just lost some money.  What you do now will have a big impact on how you feel going forward.  My advice, you can make it back but  not right now... and that's because you don't have enough knowledge or experience to do so...  and that's ok.   I think you're wise to pull the money out and then educate yourself for a few years.  Trading isn't easy for everyone, not all of us just get it.  It's ok to take a step back and to not ever trade again.  Or if you want to get back in later after you find something that really clicks with you, that's ok too.  Either way, you'll be ok and you have something to build on for deciding how you want to do your life.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:19:13'] You could have easily spent 15k on trading lessons, or someone managing your money. It is really emotionally hard to lose. If you want to trade, this is part of it. My father told me to always know exactly how much I could lose, and to understand that it is always a possibility. If losing slow down and trade smaller like as small as possible. If winning let some ride but make some real. Its only real money if you take it out. Losing is a very important lesson in life. Don’t let this keep you down too long. Money comes and goes.

But now it’s gone.  Slept for 12hrs into Saturday, finally processed and wrote down what I learned last night, and feel a bit numb to it now.  For me definitely gonna tap the breaks for awhile.  Went from confidence to scared to make a trade.   Hard to make and easy to lose.   Education is expensive.   I did learn some things though both about trading and myself.  Doesn’t mean I’ll magically get it back.Congrats on not going for broke! That’s when it really really sucks.   Save up and wait for the next bull run.  Could be awhile.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 12:59:07'] Hey bro let me give you some background on me. I’m 22 in college and I started trading in Jan 2020. I turned 7k to 25k+ then lost it all over a span of a year in 2021. Even though I tripled my account, I simply was not ready and on the level of someone who makes $$ consistently like that. It will be very wise to take a break and figure out what you want out of trading. Since I blew up badly, I’ve put in tremendous amount of work and tried different types of trading without risking money (scalp, day, swing) and I found what I liked and implemented a strategy from how I view the market. I would advise not risking $$ until you’re okay with seeing the market move a crazy amount and u not be apart of it. FOMO comes in many forms and controlling it is so key. Also if you haven’t read trading in the zone then I wouldn’t risk money until you do. Understand what you want from the market! I decided that I was going for it and I want to figure it out so I’m putting in a shit ton of work!

I didn’t have a cent extra when I was 20 and most 20 yr olds don’t.  Keep your head up you’ve got plenty of time to get that back. Your whole life is still ahead of you. It’ll make for a good story when your in your 30s and it’s all behind you. Take care.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 13:26:33'] My friend. You’re 20 and we’re entering a recession and in the worst bear market in over a decade.  Stop trading, start studying and start saving every dime. Bull markets last years and once we recover - you’ll have plenty of time to make your money back. If it makes you feel better- I’m 40 and down about 140k across all my accounts.  110k of that is from my 401k and that should recover on its own. I hope. It’s bad out here for a lot of us right now but it will get better.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 13:27:10'] If you are buying options and believe that the market will go down anyway, you can purchase puts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 15:14:01'] You’re young. Your mistake seems huge now. It is not. Not even in the context of how much it stung. There are MANY that have lost 10 times that amount in the twilight of life.  Chances are, you are being completely self absorbed and need to focus on things other than yourself and mistakes. Go help other people. $15k isn’t shit for a loss at your age. Dust yourself off, help other people avoid fucking up like you did.That’s a good path.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 16:10:20'] if it makes you feel better, and it might not but it also might!  I am a 21 yr old college student with zero life savings and can barely afford rent.  I think I will be ok.  You have 15 grand in savings still.  Don't be depressed about it, you fucked up with stocks and thats a lesson learned.  You will 100% make it through this.  It's not somthing to freak out over just to learn from.  Further advice:  Simply stop with the market.  It's too tempting to stay in and "recover" what was lost but in reality that was a loss you will never recover.  Even if you turn that 15 into 30, that original 15k is gone for ever.  Come to terms with it and make money the traditional way of college students for a year or two.  as you already considered above.  I've seen far farrr too many people in stocks ruin their lives over it, even kill themselves.  My brother has struggled with massive anxiety about it and it controls him, his mood is tied to it, it's an addiction imo.  Don't play around in stocks until you have enough money in life that you're perfectly safe losing 100% of that money.  The stock market is ALWAYS a gamble.  Don't pretend to yourself that you will be able to be safe if something goes wrong or somehow intelligently manage it.  As I said, this is certainly NOT the end of the world, you could have zero life savings as most individuals our age do, and therefore you're already ahead.  Take the lesson, pull a lot of that money out of stocks if not all of it, and focus on college.  I hope this helps :)  Note:  Your well being is far more valuable than 15k dollars that are already gone (or any amount of money).  Stop focusing on the money and focus on other forms of fulfillment for a few months
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 16:11:18'] if failing at trading options is hurting your quality of life, it may not the right time for you.Options carry risk of complete loss of principal. Be careful with your capital allocation and risk management regardless.Most options traders have lost 6 figures at one time or another, dont be too hard on yourself. There are institutions that have lost billions on options.There is nothing wrong with treasury bonds if you want to play with a risk free $400 with some small time bets. You can afford to lose $400 over two years if you yolo 2 year treasuries right now if you assume 2% inflation from here.I have friends that lost 5 figures overnight multiple times in the last month. The education youre getting from the market probably is worth the losses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 17:22:16'] First piece of advice. Don’t bet with money you can’t lose. If you have not been trading a while you need to take small bets with your max loss locked in.  Read some books on options trading and make sure you have a deep understanding of the strategies and you do a careful analysis before you make trades. Good thing is, you are 20. You have a lot of trading in front of you. Learn from your mistakes, forgive yourself, and move forward.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 02:47:02'] Never ever put most of your savings in the stock market, be it stocks, options, or any other type of investment. You should always assume that you'll lose 100% of the money you've invested. If you're not comfortable with losing what you've invested, then lower the amount you're investing with. Don't  listen to people who say stock market will always recover or the safest investments are X, Y, and Z. Nothing is 100% safe.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 06:01:23'] Wanna advise? Go to a psychotherapist. I bet you have a gambling problems.  Yeah, trading options is the slot machine of 2022 or I would say it became way more popular at 2020 with free corona money that people were burning on stock market with the simplest strategy - "buy high, sell low".  Also alongside visiting a psychotherapist, I would suggest analyzing your risk tolerance. Also you know, you can analyze your overall portfolio and match your risk tolerance. Again, believe me or not, it is always better to have a consistent +5-7% average instead of potential +20% if you went all in on SPY if swings +20% and -20% hurts your psychological state it is way safer to combine SPY with bonds right? Simplest strategy ever, wanna less volatility - increase bonds, boom.  Surely you should not treat it as investment advice as I'm not an advisor at all. I worked with an advisor and then stopped cuz I found out that I can find the same info on youtube and basically make the same portfolio. But at least pick the basic idea - you don't do "all in". You must have like 80,90 or even 95 of your portfolio invested into ETFs for a very long run. And that portfolio consists of US/nonUS ETFs for Stocks/Fixed Income. So basically 4 pieces, US ETF, US Fixed Income ETF, nonUS ETF, nonUS Fixed Income. And the % of fixed income regulates the volatility - that should match your risk tolerance. And after you settle this one you may try to experiment with 5-10% of your portfolio as a sandbox, here you can go all in but you must select this % for the sandbox based on your psychology, and how much money you can lose without breaking down mentally.  Btw, my portfolio is about -20% from the inception. I have a realized loss of 1k thanks to best ever strategy "buy high, sell low" though I sold in the mid of the China ETF fall, at 40$ (right now it is 8$ or so). Also lost some on esports ETF bet. Also, have an unrealized loss of 1k on AMD bet.

They say that experience is the best teacher, but IMHO, learning from other’s mistakes is a far better strategy.  You haven’t lost money until the minute you click the sell button.  Unless you have ridiculously bad positions and you’re trying to play options trading, if you’re hoping to hold on for the long haul, just stop looking at it.  You’re only 20 years old - you can make that much money back in several months of hard work.The money is only wasted if you haven’t learned anything from this.  I started my life over at 30 with literally less than $1k to my name and I have over $100k two years later, which is nothing in the scheme of things.

I’ll say to invest in a Index fund like VOO while the market is down which could go lower btw and hold for a few years, no doubt you’ll make it back. Now relax, is not the end. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:16:37'] I’m in the same boat. Started at the peak and it just went downhill from there. I’m down 70% on my stocks, but have made a good wedge selling covered calls. Remember you only lose money when you sell. Going forward I’m going to try to breakeven on my meme stocks, and invest those thousands in solid companies and only sell covered calls on half my portfolio, using dividend stocks with reliable companies. Less premium but way way less stress.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:37:59'] I feel you OP lost 30k this year and it wasn’t fun, I’m 21 and that was a good chunk of what I’ve worked the past couple years for. if you do wanna keep trading just backtest and paper trade until you find an edge and stay away from options at first. honestly just follow your gut though. this is a great time for long term purchases as prices are low and could go lower. Me personally I’ve been trying real hard and backtesting for a while and now I’m live with my strategy and I’m slowly climbing my way back up with discipline. It is possible to do this but blowing your account is part of the process. I haven’t heard of any trader that hasn’t blown at least one account sometimes multiple.

You'll be laughing in the next few months as people get wrecked. My biggest holdings besides tesla the past years have been uup and lentils. I outperformed the market by about 60% those 2. Tesla is about to buy back shares and prints money +doubling deliveries every year for the next decade. I have my retired parents and myself in this, and I retired at 32(pre tesla 2020 pop )It all started with 5k in 2008.You're good. Don't worry. You got this. Options are hard. This is set and mostly forget until big macro events change. Seriously. It's easier to make money on the way down with this wrecking ball doing the work for you. CheersFailure is not learning.

You are so far ahead of almost anyone your age it’s down right ridiculous! Even with $15k u r still way ahead of the curve. The loss hurts, I get it. But what u need is a little perspective. I guess that comes with age and experience (which you just paid $15k for btw). You will bounce back. That I have zero doubts about. My advice would be to take a breath, gather yourself and look at the bigger picture. You are fine. Your future is fine. Also make sure to evaluate your relationship to $$$ and make sure it isn’t falling into the unhealthy category.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 12:52:29'] Do not trade options. Only use them to monetize your stock positions. Keep the money in your account but change your strategy to something more passive.Pick good quality dividend stocks like dividend aristocrats or dividend kings. Accumulate holdings to reach 100 shares of each.Once you reach 100 shares, start selling covered calls.If your calls get in the money or near the money, try to roll the calls higher and away but always try to do it for credit or a very small debit. If not possible, let it be assigned.If you are assigned and forced to sell your 100 shares, start selling cash-secured puts until you buy back your shares.Once you have your 100 shares back, start selling covered calls again.And once waiting and holding your 100 shares, collect dividends.You will be surprised how quickly your account recovers, but even with that, it still is not a quick-rich scheme. You must give your stocks time to grow and patiently sell calls or puts (a wheel strategy - the wheel strategy can easily get you a 30%-40% annual return).If you want to be more aggressive, you can put a portion of your portfolio into SPXL ETF. It is a 3x leveraged ETF that goes up or down three times faster than the market. You can also accumulate 100 shares and sell covered calls against it. It also pays a dividend. Now is a good time to start buying. You can choose to dedicate, let's say, $5000 to this ETF, and when the market reverses, trim the gains (e.g., the amount goes to $7,000, so you trim $2,000 and save it, when the ETF amount drops to $3,000, for example, buy back shares to rais the holdings back to $5,000, and so on. But be prepared for large drawdowns as well as upsides with this ETF. If you are not ready for it, stay away).Don't bail out. You have time on your side. Do not engage in risky trades because you want to get rich quickly because you read about some lucky guys who turned their $1,000 into millions. There may be a few guys lucky to achieve it, but most people fail. It is a lottery ticket, not investing. Also, remember, trading works well if you have millions to trade. With $30k, you must be careful, or you wipe your account out fast.

At 20 with 15k to start out investing (read: not gambling like you have been) you're gonna be alright, and by the time you're 30 if you've learned from this experience you're set my man. Soldier on, you're starting over, but you're starting over super young with a lot of money in the bank (relatively)Also, in addition to what others have said I have some advice for the degenerate side of your brain. Make a separate brokerage account, and only play your risky yolo wsb plays in there. Have some fun with a small amount of money. I made a robinhood account and threw 200 bucks in, and i recognized it was 100% gambling money, if it disappeared I didn't care. It increased by 5000%, then I saw it tank by 50%, then it went up and down and up and down and I had fun with it.  But I never transferred those "strategies" into my main broker (strategies in quotes because they aren't strategies, they are gambling). That is a lot of fun for me, but it would not be fun at all if I saw my main investment account fluctuate the way my "gambling" account has.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 14:53:38'] When you say lost money do you mean the stocks you hold worth less than before or you’re trading options and losing?Big distinction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 14:55:22'] Stop trading options, you’ll keep losing money. Just keep putting all your extra income into index funds and when you’re in your 30s you’ll have a pretty sizable portfolio. If I had started doing that at your age and didn’t touch options I could have retired years ago
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 15:00:32'] Dude; it's fifteen grand, not five hundred thousand. You lost like a used Hyundai, not a GT3RS. You now have the opportunity to learn from your mistakes, dust yourself off, and have back at it. Pull out your statements and confirms and review your trades.  Think about what moves you made, why you did them, and what made them successful or not. Be honest with yourself; if you made decisions based on flawed data, make note to not do it again. If you got caught in a bad market, don't beat yourself up on those; happens to us all. Just write it off to experience; in the big picture $15K really isn't a big deal. You will earn millions in your future career in all likelihood, so just let this go...

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 17:15:10'] You're a college student. It feels like a lot of money now, but once you're out in the real world making a real salary, that -15k won't haunt you. Last year, I was trying to optimize my tax savings with my employee stock awards, and made a bad decision that cost me 90k, and also bumped UP my tax obligation by 20k on money I never had. That's more than my entire savings account now, and probably delayed my opportunity to buy a house for several years. I'm still kicking myself over that. If this bear market only costs you 15k, you're still okay. A lot of people will be losing quite a bit more (even as a percentage) before the end of the downturn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 17:22:28'] Focus on how you can get someone to give you that money without risking any of your own money. In other words, focus on developing a skill to get a good job. Once you start making real money you will realize that 15k is really not that much. Forgive yourself and move one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 20:16:31'] Buying options is like gambling. Unless I'm hedging or opening credit spreads I never buy options. They'll expire worthless. Selling out of the money is best. Look up the "wheel strategy". Do your research, it will take time but you can recover.From 5 years trading, and losing as much as you did and more I learned one thing: options sellers win most of the time although they make small gains. And when they lose, the worst is they get assigned and buy the stock at a discount :)
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 20:25:37'] Honestly, you should probably sell and move on. It’s not a lot of money (you’ll realize that over time) and it’s clearly a major source of stress affecting your life.  It could very well get worse too, and you need to be able to handle that.Get help for anxiety, quit the markets and don’t sweat it anymore. Even having 15k saved at age 20 is fucking impressive. You should have near zero at your age. You’re doing great.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 20:40:21'] I’m going to say something annoying. At least you didn’t lose it all or go into debt. In my post history I made a post about how I round tripped an account and how lost I was. Well I subsequently lost all of it and then some. So the good news is twofold. If you take a step back you will get out of your emotional driven and poor decision making mindset - your brain is objectively not rational right now. Second, there is growth on the other side of this if you commit to learning and practicing a strategy. Since you know what real loss is like, give paper trading a try. Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 21:01:03'] You are young and one of my professors once told me “you have the rest of your life to make money.”Dont think of it as a loss, but a learning experience!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 21:52:35'] Regardless of whether or not it's the right move to be taking your money out, the bigger problem is ur mindset. Since you're 20yrs old, I'm going to assume you don't have much experience in investing. However you still focused on option trading instead of regular stock investment. Obviously, options trading is riskier. You need to take a good hard look at yourself and see if you did your research to prepare yourself into stock investing. Right now, your stiuation is comparable to "I took my life savings into casino and lost 50% of it, I'm so depressed." 15g loss is nothing. More valuable takeaway here is, what have u learned from your trades? Have u documented every trades? Ex whats the DD/rationale in buying this? Is the timing right? If I made profit or loss, what did I do wrong? What can I do in the future to avoid making the same mistakes? If you've learned nothing from your lesson, then yeah, u wasted 15g. Plus you are not mentally fit yet to be investing.  Take the money, and go work on yourself. 15g is nothing and can be made back within a short time frame.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 00:08:04'] You say you are depressed. It probably comes from these impacts you experienced over the last few months as the market has been tough on you. But please have yourself checked out by a professional first.Secondly, you are a young lad (or lady) - 15k is nothing! Don’t beat yourself up over 15k. Once you finish college you are looking at salaries where you are likely able to save up 15k a year. So, don’t worry, it’s just money. You will easily earn that back, even if it looks like a lot right now. Last but not least, journal your journey here: you just paid 15k tuition! You got a lot of learnings for the future. Look at why you entered trades, where you made mistakes. These 15k tuition are a great investment into your future as they provide you with the necessary pain to seriously reflect on your trades and mistakes, to avoid making them again. On that note , also try to take learnings from this OUTSIDE of the world of trading: you can learn a lot about yourself, resilience, emotions and other angles of your personality if you take a reflection approach! Good luck, connect with friends and family and speak to a professional to avoid falling into a hole.Life is great, even if it does not look so in every moment
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 00:20:54'] Rather than taking your money out consider buying $SPY, $QQQ, $VOO, or $SCHD shares and leave them alone for the next two years while you learn more about options and the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 04:12:14'] Honestly man I’m in a pretty similar boat. I’ve come to terms with some of the mistakes I’ve made like that, but realize that’s such a small amount of money in the grand scheme of things. You’re going to college. You’ll probably save 15k within a year of working. Sure it’s a mistake, but you’ll be okay. New traders blow up accounts. It sucks when you start with 30k, but maybe it’s time to step back from trading and follow the true prime directive for actual investing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 04:23:38'] I lost money ($40K) overall until last year. My son lost everything ($30K) by day trading. Other people I know have lost significant amounts investing in the stock market, restaurants (-$200K), and real estate (-$200K). You are not alone and not a loser. It hurts to lose $15K, but it is not the end of the world. Just look at it as tuition to the college of hard knocks. How else would you have learned at the gut level that investing money is a serious business? You are right to stop trading for a while. Learn what you did wrong. Study investing before you return to the market or invest in anything else. Read about people who have become successful at investing or anything. This will give you a perspective how failure is the first step on the road to success.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 04:35:30'] Whether you trade options, equities or futures, trading is the most difficult job in the world. And, a fraction of a percent succeed. Why? Because trading is ultimately a reflection of yourself and your own inadequacies. And the most successful traders have blown up (i.e., liquidated or margin called) more than one account. The fact is, any high reward endeavor comes with high risk, and with such an endeavor, there is a price to pay, i.e., a tuition fee.   Here are three tips:   1) Treat trading as a business (read Mind Over Markets by James Dalton, specifically, "A Business Strategy" in Chapter 5);   2) Watch "Trading as a way of life" TED talk by Jihan Bowes Little ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7WgRtLbx4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7WgRtLbx4k)); and  3) Reflect on why you want to trade, your strengths, and your weaknesses, and answer the following question honestly: "Do you have what it takes to trade?"   If you have given trading 100%, and now is not the right time for you to continue, then that's ok, accept it, move on, and put your time and energy into something that isn't so emotionally taxing for you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 04:57:16'] 15k is peanuts to learn that lesson.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 05:30:48'] I did the same thing at your age. My risk management was abysmal. I've been trying for the last 10 years and still cannot be consistently profitable in trading. But, my losses are small now at least. I did a stocktake of my trades and basically about 80% of my losses were from "Yolo" trades where I pretty much expected to make big, so I risked big. Never eventuated and I was left holding the bag! My advice is, find high quality data from tick data suite (I got 10-20 years for 5 pairs on a free trial), and learn to code on mql5. Create robots so that trade execution psychology isn't necessary. Learn data analysis techniques so you can scientifically find opportunities in price data. This will allow you to see what works and what doesn't in the most reliable way possible.  Godspeed!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 07:06:35'] I’m guessing you haven’t done enough basic study. For complex tasks it takes an average person 1000 hours of study to reach apprentice level. I’d guess at least half on the sub haven’t put in this minimal amount of work. Study plus tiny live trades count to the 1000.  Reddit time doesn’t. For the math challenged that’s 20 hours a week for a year.  Sure a few people go to the casino and win. Until a person has put in the study time that’s mostly what the market is, a casino. The 1000 hours guarantees nothing but at least a person is likely doing more than gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 09:38:31'] Talk to me and I’ll help you figure out how to find an edge and actually trade an edge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 10:39:02'] To make you feel somewhat better, I lost about 11k within 1 month period from options and now my port is down 40k. I actually quit day trading after that, and I took 2 months break and I just started getting back on Covered calls (I’ve had much more success with covered calls) and I changed my day-trading mindset to long term hold if my covered call stocks go down in value (currently in TSLA and GME). Im also not counting for all the loses in the prior years lol you’ll be fine bro.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 10:53:50'] I'd say most options traders have done this, so you are not alone . . .You can quit or learn and move on, it will be up to you.  If you move on then step back and analyze how you lost so much and what you can do to prevent it from happening again.  Do you have a solid trading plan and were following it?  If not, then you NEED ONE.  If you have a trade plan and still lost, then you need to review and update it.  Trading without a plan is pure gambling and leaves you open to making rash emotional decisions that can lead to losses.Did you put too much of your account at risk?  Keeping risk to 5% per stock or position is one way to lower the risk.  Keeping 50% of your account in cash will usually help you get out of trouble if you get into it.  Figure out what went wrong and how you can avoid having it happen again will make you a much better trader.  If you do start again use a simple and high win rate strategy such as a covered call on a solid high quality stock.  Even AAPL is down, but I think we can all agree it will not stay down forever.  Holding the shares of a quality company while selling CCs can be a very good options strategy as in the worst case you still own the shares of a good company . . .

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-22 09:26:49'] Great overview and example of the IC. My only push back is that this is a particularly important quarter for Tesla, as they will be eligible to join S&P500 if they report a profitable quarter...  I think this outcome has already started to be priced in, and miss could lead to a large move down. Best of luck!!
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-22 10:29:05'] Tsla has been known to move 200$ in a day, you’re literally going to burn yourself when it passes your high or low strikes because it either surprises with profitable quarter or it fails to meet expectations..... you are going oh 200$ wide spread no problem and Tesla is like hold my beer I’ll do 300$ spike in a day

Now I have been buying more shares on Tesla below $560 little nibble $520 & below I bought probably to much oh well I’m a long time investor with Tsla. I buy the $1700 leaps every time it goes below $550 & sell them on the next big move over $600 for a good profit. I would buy Tesla shares & get up to your first 100 & start selling calls or puts. I make a great passive income on doing this I only sell weekly calls & lately I can do it 2 times a week of course buying my shares back but pennies on the dollar. But there are tons of much better trades than this. I highly recommend you don’t personally.

Either when Elon announces the CEO of Twitter or the location of the next gigafactory Mexico, its off to the races, and if neither of those things happen its still about to happen. The company is not currently going bankrupt so its going to bounce, hard, before it continues its much deserved decline to reasonable levels. This is just market science, Im surprised its been allowed to go this far. I tracked back the other day. On a five year chart Tesla has only been this oversold one other time. In 2019, it sold off 50% over 6 months then when it hit this same level of oversold it turned around and aggressively gained back 50% of what it lost over like 6 weeks. Right??'
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 18:04:58'] You say it cannot keep going down like this, but it kept going up for absolutely no reason.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 11:23:15'] FWIW, the pandemic market of 2020 and the aftermath have been a nightmare for people planning to retire near or during this period of time. Everyone's retirement portfolio is down at least 30%, even the "safe" ones that were 60/40 or 50/50 equity/bonds.So what this means for most people is delaying their retirement and continuing to work. Otherwise you will be in a textbook case of sequence of returns risk PLUS historically high inflation, either of which are retirement killers.Delaying retirement and continuing to work means you can just hold those equities until they recover, for as long as that takes.

Get a broker on the phone , let them show you how to do covered calls - safe stock secured bi weekly consistent returns plus dividends - learn about ex dividend dates . On a thousand shares of each selling covered calls on a two week DOE You should be able to make 600-700 every two weeks on Ford and 700-1000 on Merck  every two weeks . In total about 3500 a month , plus any gains in the stock value , plus dividends .

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 08:31:33'] Here’s a good way to think about stock repair. It works if the underlying recovers to difference between long strike and cost basis.

To long GME it's best to DRS on Computershare and not buy calls or run a PMCC on it. For every share that's DRS'ed it's 0.01 positive on your delta// I would lower your delta on this trade // Put in some stink bids on GME $20 puts 50-60% below Market Price as hedges so you can keep the trade running. If GME rips from here your $20 puts are ready to go. If MOASS is about to happen cancel all put buys and just let your shares ride.  I run put butterflies on GME a little more nuanced, but trade works just as well with a put debit spread or PMCP to be more precise.If your hedge wins DRS more GME shares and keep placing stink bids on ITM GME puts.

What should I do tomorrow if (1) TSLA stays flat for most of the day and (2) TSLA drops further? In the 2nd case, I am thinking of rolling it out.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 15:38:30'] Roll it... too close to max loss to even risk it. Unless TSLA rockets tomorrow and shows an OBVIOUS certainty to stay above 1050 you should roll into next week and probably lower your strikes also.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 16:26:31'] You also don’t want to let the market close near the strike, only for after hours action to bring one leg into the money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 16:35:02'] Depends on whether you have enough capital to take assignment. If not, definitely close. (Or roll, but you can think of it as closing the spread then opening new position)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 21:21:06'] Depending on your broker, they might close out your position a few hours prior to market close. This is not ideal as your offer will instantly close at bid prices so you might want to set limit offers to close the spreads yourself prior.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-12 02:44:43'] This probably doesn't apply to your case, but to answer the question about ways to close a spread, I usually set a GTC buy to close limit order for 0.01 when there are a few days left to expiry. If i had a strike so near to atm on expiry day, I'll probably make a decision within the first hour of trading based on the movement of the stock to decide whether to close early and limit the loss or let the stock wiggle to a break even or slight profit but fully accepting there's a chance for max loss if I intend to wait it out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 07:33:06'] Here’s an idea for you:Roll your call 2 months AND also sell DOTM puts I.e. $150p for a little juice.Should be able to collect 2 credits PLUS a higher call strike.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 10:01:25'] Can I use your post as a textbook example of why you should never write a covered call below the cost basis of your shares? It's remarkable how many people do this and then argue that there is no way that the price can go above the strike of their call, so there is "no risk" of being assigned for a loss on their shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 12:42:42'] Tough situation you’re in. For me it would all depend on the realized losses I’d have if the shares were called away/bought to close and my plan afterwards…
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 19:21:22'] Roll the calls as you get close to expiry. If your calls expire in April and you roll now you will have to pay debit.  It closer to expiry all value burns off and then even if you roll for flat strike, you can get credit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 06:27:33'] If you like unrealized capital gains , or an investor buy the calls back! If you like to make money from the business operations (dividend),  and short calls do nothing ,and (idk if tesla pay div) buy it back at a lower price if that meets your goal! You need to know what your plan is here , I would learn dynamic  stock if you like to own the stock. It is like the wheel but your holding the stock the whole time! You need to sit back , and reverse engineer to see what option you have to meet your goals! Do you want to grow your assest column,  do you want to create new money short calls , dividend, etc! Are you more of a trader where you care more about your net worth ! Some People just need to buy the business cheap , and write far otm calls to reach their goals! What are your goals for the year , maybe it is to sell your assests and reallocate it to something that will work for your goals ! I don't adjust,  and repair just to do it , I actually try to reach a certain threshold !

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 13:33:05'] Close the 144 strike one because it has the highest $value. I assume you bought these calls when the stock price was below 144, which means these are giving you the largest $ profit too. Lock that in.If u have 10 contracts each of these and the 220 strike, then these calls make up the bulk of your TSLA position. These have the highest delta too. So if TSLA retreats the profit will diminish quickly (and vice versa if TSLA shoots up). These 144 calls are making your whole TSLA position very delta sensitive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 14:59:59'] How about making a ghetto spread?

Now the challenge is to figure out what they were buying and selling. One way to approach this is to look at the side of the quote the order printed on, with the assumption being that bidside trades are seller-initiated, and askside trades are buyer-initiated. This is a variation of the Lee-Ready quote rule cited in their 1991 paper. Applying this model, it looks like the trader bought the Oct 230c, sold the Nov 230c, and the other 2 legs are unclear as midmkt prints. One approach to classify the midmkt trades is to compare the prices to the theo value (we source ours from [ftoptions.com](https://ftoptions.com) in Chicago, they do a very good market-maker style dynamic fit), assuming trades above theo are buyer-initiated and below theo are seller-initiated. That would suggest the Oct 265 calls were bought and the Nov 280 calls were bought (that part CNBC got right). So now the picture looks like a buyer of the Oct 230/265 call spread for $26.69, and seller of the Nov 230/280 call spread for $26.79 - a net dime credit. Using the same theos to calculate the price of this as a single package gives a value of a few cents, which means the fill was near value. There are a few more ways to confirm this- open interest changes for the following day:|usymbol|expiry|strike|putcall|openint|oichg|date|close||:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-||TSLA|10/18/2019|230|C|5174|\-5203|10/16/2019|$29.80||TSLA|10/18/2019|265|C|5972|\-4874|10/16/2019|$1.10||TSLA|11/15/2019|230|C|14196|6036|10/16/2019|$35.13||TSLA|11/15/2019|280|C|7446|4042|10/16/2019|$7.28|This confirms the Oct contracts were closing, while the Novembers were opening, and also there is an exchange feed from the ISE that identifies customer buying and selling for each contract.

The point of this is to (hopefully) see shares return to lower levels when they can exit the spread for a lower price. They did get long 6K of the Nov 280 calls- but only as the long leg of the short call spread, which is now $20 deep and trading near $45. The profit figures being tossed around on the long Nov 280s (up $18 \* 6K = 10.8M) are offset by the larger loss on the short Nov 230 calls (-$35 \*6K = -21M), which nets out to a hit near $10M on this trade. It is certainly possibly the seller is long Tesla common stock and was using these call spread sales as an income generator - if so the sting is not so bad, but the initial in-the-money strike price of 230 would be an odd choice for a long-term holder.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 09:45:10'] You could sell 1025 calls, 850/800 put spread into earnings and close after earnings when vol comes in, or close out long calls just before the close prior to earnings and take your loss. Most likely OTM calls will drop hard after. Same idea for SPY to salvage what you can. Vol is high right now to sell premium in SPY but could drop hard after FOMC this afternoon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-26 09:28:34'] Regarding your SPY 466c, I'm not at all convinced this rally will go that high.  I think we might get up to 450 and then if we don't break through we start going down again.  In addition, JPow is talking today at 2:30PM EST, likely IV will drop after that.  SPY is pretty likely to go up, but with IV down you could easily see your calls drop in value even if SPY does go up.  Basically holding is taking a gamble... I'd recommend taking at least some profits before JPow speaks.  Whatever you hold afterwards, if we get up to 450 and don't break through I'd say sell then because we're likely to turn downwards again.TSLA has been following SPY pretty closely lately and your TSLA calls are in a similar spot.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 21:55:26'] Ultimately, you need to decide what you are comfortable with, because no one knows what will happen to TSLA. If you are this worried about it, then I’d recommend you get out. Doesn’t mean you have to get out at open Tues morning - you could see what happens in the morning market and re-evaluate, or just make a deal with yourself that you are getting out no matter what by 12pm EST, or whatever. And no matter when you get out, or stay in, one of two things will happen:1. TSLA will go up. 2. TSLA will go down. 3. BothYou might stay in & TSLA might tank & you might lose the entire $16k. You might get out right before TSLA takes off to $1000. THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN - so just own up to the fact you are holding a lottery ticket, and decide if you want to stay in, risk it all to hopefully win, or take your loss and get out with whatever you still can. Whichever let’s you sleep better at night.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 02:04:09'] You can either sell, spread off the call by selling a higher OTM call, or a shorter strike call. Frankly, selling a 950 call will lessen your bleed and lower your vega exposure, since a grind upwards normally lowers the vol a bit. This may, or may not, be true with Tesla. I dont trade it and so don't know that landscape at all. But you will still bleed out unless you get a pop. What are the odds of a pop? A pop to the extent that you need it? At what level rise or fall do you close out?You could sell 4 higher strike calls and make it into some sort of back ratio. But this changes the structure completely and may not be the profile you desire. It really depends on the flow of normal and jump vol through a bump within Tesla.edit: removed my take on 'advice' as you probably already feel bad enough. No need for extra salt. Hope the weekend cheers you up a bit!

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 23:21:52'] Close two of them and keep one? If you’re not happy with the amount of risk you’ve taken on, reduce that risk — even if it costs you money. Being able to sleep well at night is worth something as well. The lesson here is (you’re about to pay tuition fees, so might as well learn something) — don’t invest based on a friend’s recommendation. Do your own research. It’s fine pointing out what you feel are opportunities to friends, but you’re the one who pulled the trigger. Own it.If by some miracle you do make a profit here, please remember that that’s down to pure luck and not skill.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 23:37:20'] Stop loss is your best friend. Remember you can always buy back in at a lower cost instead of losing it all.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 23:40:53'] I would probably stay in it and ride it out.  You've got about 20K on TSLA right now...and there is a reasonable chance TSLA will spike higher at some point and you'll regain your money.It's tough I've shorted TSLA enough times over the past 3 months and lost every time.  It's a beast.  It's likely to climb higher.  You better root for a good earnings play in the next few weeks.I suspect everyone will get a boner as we get closer to earnings and want to buy in, driving the stock higher.  When dudes get boners they do dumb things.  I guess the same thing happens to women when their glands get all engorged too.Let me put it to you this way.  If TSLA drops to 750 I'm buying shares for the long term in my IRA.  That's how important this company is to EV and EV Tech.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 22:56:59'] Sell calls a few strikes above $900 with the same expiration to cap your max gains but greatly limit your losses. Look up “call debit spreads” for more info
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 00:07:39'] I have held calls before earnings and before battery day, the profits would be insane but so would be the losses if it’s doesn’t perform. I would suggest to wait till next Tuesday and see how the price action is, keeping in mind that Tesla did meet the 500K deliveries promised I think we will have a run up before the earnings, so you may end up lucky. But do not even think to hold after earnings, the burn after earnings will be bad that it will leave a scar. TLDR, Wait a couple more days and get our in profit, don’t be into earnings. Advice from a trader who lost 9K after earnings, but also made 90K prior to earnings only with Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 01:38:26'] There are good reasons to be bullish on the earnings but the problem is that there is no way to be sure which way the market will react.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 03:47:46'] Volatility is likely to collapse after earnings so if it doesn’t spike hard you might get crushed.   Definitely possible but consider what your break even point is at expiration (960$) and if that is reasonable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 22:32:36'] Did you have any kind of initial plan.  Let's say tesla was up 2% today would you have sold your position?  Just know between now and expiration there will be ups and downs.  If you can't ride out one day, I'd stay away from options completely. A lot of maket sectors were red today.  Tesla is incredibly volatile, at least reevaluate on Monday.  You've got enough time so while theta sucks you're in a position where things can still go your way.   If you're in over your head and can't afford to lose the entire position see if you can get out or at a minimum dump 1 or 2 of the contracts and hold the rest.  Don't panic yet and a 2-3% daily gain for tesla is easy, but could go the other direction just as easily. But again this is all dependant on your risk tolerance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 23:17:39'] Sell jan29 1000 calls, currently $10.60 against your feb19 calls. Keep selling shorter dated calls above your strike to reduce your cost for the feb19 $900.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 00:50:55'] Well, for the naked call it's pretty much like gambling, you are betting TSLA would go up. So when you are betting something, why did you do it while concerning so much about your wager? If you care about the loss very much or hadn't realized what it would be meant to you, why did you start the bet?And if TSLA went up, how much the profits it would be? Is it worth you to take the risk to bet it?If you still fear to lose your money and can't evaluate the risk, don't put any positon in options, otherwise, you only have the option to say good bye to your money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 01:04:00'] Long call OTM will decay more as extrinsic value decay more for OTM than ITM call option. That’s the reason why you loss 2 K just over the long weekend. If you are still bullish on Telsa, you still have to get out 1 week before expiry as Theta and IV decay will be big. If you bought with long duration, you might still have chance to win some money. Now you need to decide what is the best price and time to close out your position and get back what is remaining still.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 03:26:17'] Alexa, play Urgent by Foreigner.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 04:01:11'] Tesla tends to flatten or drop after earnings. They already announced their deliveries and we saw an increase after that. Not saying it won't go up, but it will need more than just the earnings event IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 06:02:53'] Hmm when tesla comes up to like 850 area sell some calls up higher like tsla 920? That should get you alotnodnyour initial capital back and protect you from downside while having some upside. Or just sell the entire position up to you.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 06:51:48'] The risk reward is absolutely brutal on Tesla upside.. I'd give this play a massive "nope". If anything, do a straddle / strangle play and bet on more volatility, or just buy some puts frankly.. Just look at its chart, it's beyond dot com levels of absurdity just based on technicals, and whilst I realize Tesla has a real solid product and business, unlike most dot coms, I would remind everyone that Amazon and Microsoft had real products / businesses, the future looked super bright (and was) for both of them, yet they both fell like 80% when the dot com bubble popped because the technicals and valuations simply could not support their prices (which weren't even as bad as Tesla currently is..).
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 07:51:27'] I’d ride it until at least Jan 29th, to see if the earnings release, and news being released then about the S & X “refresh,” bump up the SP.  You might be pleasantly surprised, but if the possibility of losing $$ is messing with your mind, you’re probably better off just cutting bait and selling your options.You can do options fairly risk free if structured well.  For example, if you buy 100 shares you can sell to open a call at a Strike Price well above the then-Share Price.  At the end of the week you get to keep a premium paid to you for doing so AND you get to keep  your shares if the Strike Price hasn’t triggered a sale of your shares.  If you think the Strike Price is looking like it will be hit, you can “buy to close” your open position, or just let the shares be purchased from you at the Strike Price, allowing you to buy another 100 shares at a reduced price when including the premium you were paid.  Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 08:32:43'] OTM options accelerate their decay well in advance of expiration. I'd highly recommend graphing out the curve since it sounds like you do not have intuitive understanding of this relationship between decay and moneyness.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-16 09:18:56'] Think through the trade. List the reasons why you're bullish on TSLA. Then list the reasons why the bullish case might be wrong. If you can't come up with a few reasons why you might be wrong then you're blind to the risk that you're taking. When you've taken the emotion out of the trade and are looking at more objective data, then you can better decide what you should do with the trade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 16:56:13'] You have to remember that the underlying stock is traded after-hours and pre-market, so there could be change there.  But yeah, I get what you're saying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 17:09:27'] Theta is based on days to expiration.  On market open, the days is one less than the prior close.The strike price is funny because there was a 3:1 stock split of TSLA in August.  Any existing contracts were adjusted because of that.   Generally speaking you want to stay away from strikes with odd prices.  They sometimes are non-standard options without much liquidity because the underlying isn't 100 shares.  However, it doesn't matter in this case.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 05:08:19'] Theta is time to expiration, not days. It's not an integer that ticks over at midnight. Last night, you had 24 hours of TTE. At the open, you will have 6.5 hours left. For far dated terms, the fact that theta includes the fractions of the days doesn't mean a lot, but for near terms, it has a larger effect, especially in the last 48 hours. All the news and overnight stock moves dont have any way to affect the option price during that overnight period (GTH excluded cause it's often very chunky). It all hits at 930, along with the overnight theta.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 17:11:42'] Premarket trading & IV bud.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 16:57:13'] I'm guessing the strike price is because of a recent split.  Personally I tend to stay away from those because of liquidity issues.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 03:07:44'] There are both practical and theoretical reasons that gaps are possible in options prices. Logistical things like after-market/pre-market trading pushes stock prices around until options prices are finally updated on the opening tick. From a theory perspective, why do prices move to begin with? In theory, price reflects a combination of available information and aggregate sentiment. We expect prices to change overnight because information can arrive after close and sentiment can change any time. It’s just that market makers don’t update posted prices until open.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 20:10:49'] I've been in and out of various semiconductor calls for the past half year or so. Recently lost like 10k over a couple days from AMD calls when the GME stuff messed up the market. Still holding some AMD calls now anyway.Aside from that I've been doing well with TSMC calls. TSMC and ASML should be safe long term picks in general since both are basically 'required' for the semiconductor industry to work as TSMC is basically a duopoly (with Samsung), while ASML is pretty much a monopoly. Intel and AMD may potentially have movement later this month when Intel's new CEO is supposed to talk about Intel's future. QCOM will likely rebound after it plummeted on bad earnings which really wasn't all that bad aside from the shortage issues everyone else is also facing.As for the semiconductor shortage, any near term big price movement is basically banking on Biden's words. The administration says they will address supply chain issues in the 'coming weeks', semi conductors included with that. But regardless of what they say it won't 'fix' the issues right away, but could offer certain (or all) companies monetary incentives. Nobody knows what he will say/do, so it's up in the air what companies actually benefit the most from it. Could always just buy calls on a semiconductor ETF.

POST_TEXT: b'Okay, so first and foremost I know a similar question has likely been asked before however I couldnt find anything pertaining to my exact situation. \n\nI bought Tesla calls on Monday, on Tuesday he announced his investor day on March 1st(?) and his master plan 3 for Tesla. \n\nObviously Tesla has been on a run the last little bit and even more so this week. My question is: Calls expire March 3rd. Will time decay still be a factor if I am largely in the money come investors day on March 3rd? Should I sell to close now and open longer term options as a hedge or hold my position? Even if not as a hedge Id like to reinvest my profit into more calls and wondering if this would make sense knowing Id have to get in at a higher striker on new calls (current is $195). \n\nThanks in advance sorry if this is a stupid or redundant question I havent traded options for around 2 years.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 07:57:40'] OK, so just to clarify :On this Mon, you bought 195 strike calls expiring on 03-Mar.The investor day is 01-Mar.You want to know if there will be much time value in your calls on 01-Mar because you think the calls will be largely itm?Ans: If the stock remains at its current level (212) or above by 01-Mar, there will be very little time value in your calls.If the stock falls to 195, there will be some time value. To give you a rough idea of how much, look at the ATM calls expiring this Fri and multiply this by 1.5 say (for increased vol due to investors day).No one can possible tell you if you should close, or hold, or roll cos, well.....none of us know what TSLA will do the next day let alone the next month.Also, you didn't tell us what you paid for your calls, so we don't know what your current profit level is. I suspect you paid around 14-16. If the calls have hit your profit target, then close.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 07:59:49'] The extrinsic remaining on your options is all that can decay. Find out how much it is and ask yourself if it's worth waiting for that amount. As expiration approaches those options will shed the extrinsic and approach 100 delta.The only way to offset short theta (which you have) is with long theta - selling options. If your thesis on $TSLA is bullish, you could find some puts with theta equal to the theta on your calls and sell those, and retain upside exposure. You could also sell nearby calls and "lock in" your gains, but at that point, you may as well monetize your calls. You said you basically want to roll your calls higher (pocket gains now and spend some on a new bullish call trade) so this may be the best course.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 08:23:11'] What is the delta of your calls?  Once it gets above .90 to even 1.00 the extrinsic value that can decay is mostly gone.IMO take each trade and close at your predetermined profit or loss target.  Once closed then plan your next trade based on the current market and stock price.Your idea of “reinvesting” may not make sense come that time, so be sure to analyze what makes sense then.  Many make some good profits and then make new trades to “reinvest” that lose it all . . .
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 08:50:49'] That's a lot of worry about theta, when maybe delta is the bigger threat right now. And maybe vega, if IV is unusually high.[Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/risk_reward_and_exits)
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 08:54:13'] If itm only the extrinsic value will decay. Intrinsic value doesn’t decay. The extrinsic value decays with time no matter how deep itm it is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 13:54:33'] If you bought calls, there might be a run-up in volatility and then some IV crush the day after the investor day. I would probably take profit the day before or the day of investor day if you can.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-15 06:09:43'] Do you own a lot of 100 shares of TSLA? That is what you would sell the CC against and the thought process should balance the premium issued to what you would not mind getting the shares called away at (strike) if it is assigned.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-15 06:27:34'] Sell covered calls further out. You want to sell high time value and leave time for adjustments. I would look at 4/16. Then consider that for 4/16 there is a 30% chance TSLA will finish over 760. That would be my happy place. But.. you should sell CCs when you see sell signals. TSLA looks like a buy right now. If you sell them now and the price rises you go on the hole. You want to try to catch a high then buy out of it on a dip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-15 07:13:01'] Well you get more than double the premium for holding double the time, so sell the longer one.Worst case scenario is it goes over $800 and you get called away, but you'll still be getting $800/share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-15 10:24:59'] Never sell covered calls on a stock you wish to keep. Follow that as a general rule and you'll do well, albeit maybe miss potential gains. However anything positive is a win to me.

POST_TEXT: b'Hi Guys,\n\nI\'m confused and would like further clarification. I put in a long options order on TSLA and i thought that if it went pear-shaped, that all i would lose is my max loss which i was okay with and had the   \ncash funds available should this occur. \n\nWhat happened was that my broker sold my order (not at my request) and explained that this was done as it\'s not just "the losses, it\'s the underlying shares" and that there is a "risk of receiving shares you can\'t afford." I thought there was only this risk of not being able to cover your trade when one was Buying to Sell and collected premium. But when I pay the premium, I thought my max loss was capped at that. \n\nI put this order in close to closing on the expiration day but they said they would fill future risky orders at any time during the trading day, even well before closing.\n\nI\'m still confused as to how when going long and paying the premium, why my max loss isn\'t my max loss?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 13:35:02'] I presume you have a long call.  If not it’s similar but I can clarify.On a long call most brokers by default will exercise if it expires even $.01 in the money.  Many will allow you to not exercise but a lot don’t want to deal with that and would rather just close the position and avoid the mess.  It’s up to the broker and their policies around this.That being said you should have lost less than what you paid since, presumably, there was still some extrinsic value left when they closed it.  So you should not have lost more than your premium paid.  They are concerned about the shares being exercised and you not having the funds to buy 100 shares of TSLA at your strike.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 13:30:27'] OK, first, either change brokers or stop making trades your account cannot handle.The max risk of a long (bought) option is the debit price paid, UNLESS the option is closed early when it could be for a net loss above that amount.The option must have been close to the money and therefore at risk of expiring ITM when it would have been exercised and you assigned the shares.  Most brokers will permit you to manage your own positions, but it sounds like your broker (RH right?) didn't want to take the chance you might forget to close the position and closed it for you without regards to your p&l . . .Check the final numbers as you should not have lost much more than you paid.  A good lesson here it not to let options stay open on the day of expiration.  If they had a profit then close and take it, if it has a loss then close to take off any risk, but close them by around mid to late morning on the day of expiration.  If you want to seriously trade options then be sure to get a full featured broker.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 15:15:36'] Your confused, I'm confused. What was the position you had. You said it was Long... It sounds like your broker thought you were short.So what was the position.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 16:54:53'] Your broker saved your ass.  You were likely about to purchase 100 shares of Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:59:05'] Thread already explained everything about exercise-by-exception. What I want to address is your habit of holding options through expiration, not to mention opening long calls shortly before the close of expiration day! Why?Your assumption of "I can only lose what I paid for the call" *only applies if you DON'T hold through expiration*. So the simple solution is to stop doing that. And stop opening on expiration day, unless you know what you are doing and are intentionally making a gamma risk play, which doesn't sound likely.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 10:22:35'] If you were going to buy a 1200$ call on TSLA expiring on friday it will need a 5% upward move to even breakeven. Pretty sure a put at the same price would require an even larger move downward.Its basically just gambling if you are trying to play with cheap TSLA contracts.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 10:23:20'] you should spend your time trying to find another reliable source of income before you start trading.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 10:21:00'] Please don’t buy calls on Tesla, that is idiotic if you are trying to be on the safer side and not loose all your money. Palantir calls are preferable, and since you cannot trade PLTR, find a different stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 10:32:24'] The TSLA $710 call 2/26 is $11.43 right now, but it’s probably not a good idea to spend all of your money on a single contract. I’d probably just paper trade options for a while, or start by buying an option with cheap premiums like XOM.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 10:40:33'] Both stock you wanted have very high IV at present.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 11:35:08'] I would look into the Wheel, but telsa is too expensive for that. For the Wheel you want high IV stocks, look an IV Rank over 75%. With 1.2K to lose you would need to do it on a stock with a price around $12.If you are willing to take some risk I would also look into PMCC (Poor Man's Covered Calls) with low IV stocks you are long term bullish on. Just make sure the underlying LEAPS call has a delta higher than 0.7 and that the debut payed is less than 75% the difference in strikes. Telsa is also probably to expensive for this though.If you really want to play Tesla than you can do spreads since they have defined risk, just don't get greedy and hold till they expire. If IV Rank is over 50% do a credit spread, if it's under do a debit spread. With the drop yesterday and today its probably over.

This AM was -32% of late Jan.  Feb is not over yet.I looked into tsla, the cheapest option is betting Jerome Powell testimony was sold. Tesla will quickly restore its old value. Traded last $698. Buy the cheapest premium at $710, you bet by Friday closing it will be $710+15.10=$725.10 is your breakeven prices. That means it has to be higher >725.10 from 9:30 am Thur til Fri closing hour. It has been dropping $50 daily.  Pltr if anything is likely lower. Play puts requires lots of luck. Not recommended unless all stocks crash(>-30%)-unlikely.Keep your 1200 Euros. No offense.

POST_TEXT: b"A month ago I posted about Tesla (when it was $830) and compared a call spread (the July 830/1000)  vs the 1000 call because they were similar prices ($55 on the spread, $47 on the call). Here was [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gij559/higher_probability_trading_in_high_dollar_stocks/).\n\nOne of the things you often hear traders talk about (and it's even discussed in the comments on that post) is when doing a multi-leg trade, if the move happens too quickly, sometimes you wish you had just done something more 'simple'.\n\nIn this case TSLA hit the target of $1000 a month 'too soon'. I revisited these trades today and to compare how they performed vs eachother.\n\nBut more importantly, I wanted to show how I manage a vertical spread when it's gone ITM and hit its target with alot of time to go til expiration. I'm not sure a ton of people understand that flip... from going long premium with decay *against* you... to long premium and decay *with* you.\n\nIt's a cool"
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-18 11:24:46'] Thanks for sharing insightful strategy. Just out of curiosity, do you think this can be applied to SPY/SPX options as well? Or it’s better strategy for individual stock with less volatility?
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-18 14:52:33'] You may be better off analyzing using delta. Once the short leg starts to pick up deltas against the long leg is when you should look to close out the trade; if you're still bullish then reestablish in the later expriry.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-18 13:04:01'] This is top quality content, thanks for sharing!
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-18 19:13:28'] Nice simple example.The simple explanation for others reading is that calls with lower strikes have higher deltas, meaning they gain more value each dollar the stock goes up compared to higher strikes.Why? Because when you're that deep in the money, it's almost like you own the stock. If the stock goes up a dollar, your call should go up by almost a dollar. On the 1000 call, there's still a risk that the call doesn't hit, so the delta is much lower, therefore it goes up less per dollar.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-24 06:11:56'] my feeling on Tesla, and has been for a while now is that it's that one sports team that your fav. team can never beat.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 18:11:30'] You have to have at least 100 shares of TSLA, and a basic understanding of options. [Start with Brad Finn](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wDFj310VJlM). He’s a good teacher (basically because he’s also an actual teacher. In a school).
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 19:40:33'] Good strategy in this market!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 18:21:51'] The basics are you sell one call per 100 shares you own. Pick the price you're willing to sell it at and the date. If it's at or below the price after the date it'll expire and disappear the next day (usually Saturday). If above, you sell the stock at the strike price.You can buy to close if the price is close to the strike right before market close on the expiration date for less than you received.But be aware that you can only do this during market hours (4pm eastern) but there are after hours until 8pm where the price could go past your strike.Also, if you want to sell at a generally safe price, choose a Delta around .3. On E-Trade you have to select "Greeks" from the drop down and select "search" to see the Delta.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 13:08:44'] Forget the Greeks and forget losing your stock. Try to make 1/2% a week. I’ve been doing this weekly for many years. Keep it to one week, too much can happen in a month or longer. Rake off half a percent a week for 26% a year. If your option will exercise on Friday close it out and sell a new one for the following week a few points higher. You never have to lose your stock. Generally this will work 48 weeks a year and maybe 4 times you buy back the call. Do it every Monday. Do not go longer than a week. The returns will likely beat most managed funds.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 21:08:35'] Etrade makes the execution fairly easy.  Simply select: **Sell to Open** in the *"Action"* drop down and then select **Call** in the *'Type'* drop down.  Then pick the expiration date of the option and the strike price you would be willing to sell your shares at.   I would then recommend using a limit order *(somewhere between the bid and ask)* to determine the premium you receive, rather than accepting the market price.  If you have enough shares the system automatically marks them as covered.  If you don't have enough shares *(or already have them in use as collateral for another CC)*, the system automatically checks to see if you have Options level 4 approval, and if not it will give  you an error and not let you sell the naked call. Now only do this if you are truly ready to sell the shares you have and are ok giving up future gains on the stock, while at the same time you don't need the money right away and are ok not getting to sell your shares at the current price.   I mention this because there are too many people out there who lament their decisions because they can't cope with the lost opportunity costs of their shares being sold and missing out on gains as the stock goes up, or not having their shares sell and missing the peak as the stock drops.

It only costs you an opportunity. You are selling the opportunity, but not a requirement, to buy 100 of your shares for the agreed Strike price. You will make profit no matter what, if assigned or not, you just cap your gains. You can always just buy back in...IMO I sell 45 days to expiration, at a strike that ensures I'm happily profitable and satisfied if I sold. Don't overthink it. This is the perfect market for fairly out of the money covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 19:30:45'] NO, emphatically no no no it is NOT that simple. There’s a lot more to it. Options are complex. It’s a shorty volatility trade. It’s not income generating or less risky (myths). Don’t forget tax implications. Last decade it’s been a horrific strategy despite marketing (aka YouTube videos) associated with it. You are selling off future gains for marginal downside protection. Remember, if it seems too good to be true …Brokerages love clients to do this strategy as you house the majority of the risk Listen it’s literally a boomer strategy that grew in popularity years ago and is being recycled now because it gets you to trade a lot and generate fees. You will most certainly get lower returns than simply holding that stock (compared to how most ppl use cc) Ultimately you have to evaluate the volatility, and determine if the premium is WORTH the risk of risking shares as collateral. How do you decide if the premium + the forecast risk is worth it? What’s the fair value of the premium and can you tell if there’s a + expected value ? Answer those questions and then you can take it, generally it’ll be a -EV strat. TLDR: not simple, do not recommend, fake gurus “love this one easy options trick ..”

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 06:38:17'] In short yes. If you do this often there will be a day when you run into the edge case where the stock settles approximately in the strike price on the day of expiration. The main disadvantage of that is that you won’t know your positon until the next day.

POST_TEXT: b"I would like to make TSLA 10% of my portfolio but that would make it just 10 shares and that's not a whole lot. I figured if I did an 840/1200 call spread for Jun 2022 that would be a debit of 9.5\\~10K, putting it at my 10% allocation. I don't mind if my profits are capped at 1200 as that seems to be the high end estimation for 2022 and I am bullish on TSLA. Looking at the option calculator this gives me a max return of 22,400 dollars, a good deal larger than the 3.5K profit if I simply held and sold 10 shares.  Would this be a sound decision?"

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 09:18:49'] It's good information.  The only issue I have with it is the part about a covered strangle addressing the issues you enumerated.      A wheel typically starts off with a low delta short put.  If assigned, you write an ATM or OTM covered call so now it's a high(er) delta position.  A covered call is equivalent to a short put so in either case, effectively, you have a short put position.    A covered strangle is equivalent to two short puts.  In terms of strategy, it's more premium in your pocket and you've dollar cost averaged (if assigned).  There's no magic here.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 23:43:57'] A plan? 😂
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 05:42:42'] I think people would be much better off if they applied some sort of trend following strategy with The Wheel.  Most of the "Help me! I sold a put on XYZ" posts I see, I pull up the chart and the daily, weeklies, and monthlies look like a dog's breakfast.  They are trading below all major MAs, volume is piddly, and the chart is printing a series of lower highs and lower lows in succession.Honestly, I think the bare minimum to do the Wheel (assuming you are treating it like a short-term swing trade vs. a longer term strategy) is to trade it when a) price is above a medium term moving average like the 50 or 63 (quarterly) and made a new confirmed pivot high over it, over the quarterly Volume Profile Point of Control, the Weekly MACD is green and rising, etc.  Honestly, anything that shows that the medium term trend is steadily holding to rising...it can be whatever you want it to be but it has to show strength.Since the Wheel is generally a bullish strategy (the expectation is that the puts will never be assigned) you want price to keep making higher highs and higher lows.  Once it stops doing that, you shut it down and look for a ticker that is.  This is the reason so many people here and in /thetagang were so pro-Wheel for most of 2020-2021 is because the market just kept going higher. It was a viable strategy that was fairly easy to implement and most were holding for a few weeks and closing out for profits by selling a put at support, getting assigned or having it expire worthless, and then selling the shares at the clear resistance point.  People can still trade the Wheel if that is what they are comfortable doing, but pick stocks that are strong, like energy and basic materials, or mining, for example.  Don't trade $AMD, $TSLA, $NVDA, etc. because it has to turn around.  Sure, it probably will, but is that $1.00 in premium right now really worth 6-18 months of pain and torture until it does?  For most, I think not, based on the bi-weekly "help!" posts I see on a lot of options trading subs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 08:26:40'] Lol.I have a CSP on F for $13... I'm absolutely gonna get assigned. I'm ok with that, though. I'm ok holding F for awhile.... already have 100 shares in my dividend account.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 08:26:41'] Stock analysis changes as stocks that passed your test last year, month, or week may not pass today.  With that said, good quality blue chip style stocks are generally a good place to be invested during a downturn.  Cash is also a good place based on your view of the market cycle.  If the stock blows past the price you want to own it at and/or your analysis is that this stock is no longer one you want to own or hold, then close for a loss and move on.  If this is happening more than a couple of times a year then look at how you are analyzing and selecting stocks.  Too many traders trade these high risk stocks and then complain when they have to "bag hold" them.  For example, I stopped trading TSLA some time back when Musk was doing odd things (smoking pot on video) as I recognized the stock was not driven by fundamental business factors like profits, and they weren't profitable for some time.  TSLA was always a *speculative play* and has a cult following which has no place when trading the wheel.  Should anyone be surprised that TSLA dropped like it did?  With all of the other EVs coming out will TSLA keep their cult status?  If someone wants to trade TSLA then do so with a small (5%) of the account as more of a gamble.  I'd give TSLA 5+ years to see if they settle and become a stable blue chip style stock before trading it, or expect the wild price swings to keep happening.  Part of what makes TSLA attractive is the high volatility that offers bigger premiums, which are an indication of its risk.  Stocks with high premiums relative to their price should often be avoided as there are higher risk or the premiums would not be so high!  AAPL would be a better example.  It has dropped and many may be rolling or assigned shares, but I expect few would think this is not a good stock to hold, and maybe even add to their positions as risk and the account allows.  Many years ago AAPL was like TSLA and is now a blue chip style mature company with solid management worthy of trading and investing in.  Part of the wheel strategy is to be a shareholder when needed, and that is why each trader will want to trade stocks they would not mind holding through these down market times, which we all know will not last forever.   A covered strangle is a good strategy for those who have become assigned shares on a good stock provided they are prepared to buy more shares if the put is assigned and doing this does not make this or any stock too large of risk in an account.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 01:18:56'] I also prefer the covered strangle.I also am beginning to look at any potential put in terms of holding 3 assignments, one at the put strike, and two more at 3-5 lower strikes (to both, juice the premiums, and if assigned on all puts, take advantage of a much lower cost basis).A TSLA example - assume you sell a 90p & (2x) 75p:1 assignment means 100@$90 (less 3 premiums)3 assignments = 300@$80 less 3 premiumsOn the 3 assignments, I would sell 2 ATM calls and get back to 100@$80.Obviously, one need to be able to carry 300 shares (at a good price) short term, but I think provides a fluffier cushion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 10:50:42'] That's a fair point that I think can be applied to any trade plan. Buying calls that expire in 2 years because ... LEAPS, right? Same mindset problem.For the Wheel specifically, I think another big problem is underestimating the capital requirement. It costs a lot of money to trade 100% collateral CSPs and CCs, if you are trading equities that cost $50/share or higher. I'm astounded at how many people Wheel SPY and QQQ! But if they can't afford $50/share or higher, that makes people trade shares with lower prices, and a lot of those companies are in bad shape or are new with no track record of consistent shareholder value. In other words, the high cost of the Wheel forces them into sub-standard equities.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 19:50:03'] People who wheel think they are long term investing. Far from the truth. It's just trading because you are constantly selling premium against and rolling etc etc.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-13 22:35:46'] Nothing wrong with that. If you want to go even further with leverage, just learn how to set up a PMCC or call diagonal spread. I find you can typically leverage 2:1 compared to covered calls. This means you can collect 2x premium taking in the risk of having an option instead of shares.

They don’t go out for more than a few years because the price of the option starts to approach the price of buying the stock today. There’s a natural limit to the price of options. They can’t exceed the current price of the stock because nobody in their right mind would spend $800 in premiums to buy a LEAP when they can pay $800 to buy the stock right now.Risk $700 for the right to buy at $800?  No thanks.  $400 for $800 strike?  Nope.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 15:26:26'] Don’t forget-%25 your dividend goes back to the Israel gov…so you’re only really getting %75 of that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 18:58:37'] ZIM is a shipping company. Shipping companies are inherently cyclical. There was a huge spike in freight rates, which led companies to over-earn and be able to pay this dividend. Look at what freight prices have been doing recently (https://fbx.freightos.com/) they’re falling off a cliff. If we go into recession next year, these rates could go even lower and then ZIM will have MUCH worse margins, and have depressed earnings. The stock market is forward looking, a dividend yield is inherently backwards looking. There’s no way ZIM will be able to maintain their dividend because they have massive headwinds with slowing economy. ZIM could be a good long term investment, but those are the main reasons someone would sell this stock. Look at their profitability before 2020, they used to be a break even business at best, and now they have massive profits. Wouldn’t be surprised to see them at break even again if the economy and demand for goods cools. The question is, are you happy to own the company at a much lower earnings (I.e. higher P/E if price stays the same)?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 18:44:06'] Using historical dividends as an assumption of the future is misleading here but for most companies it’s a reasonable way to present the data in a general format. ZIM’s business model just doesn’t fit the mold though. I think a lot of fear is priced into the stock, it pays out a majority of earnings as dividends and those are tied to shipping rates which are cyclical, coming off highs of pandemic supply chain issues and into a looming recession. But will it never making money on shipping contracts again? No, but people are quick to see the yield and call it a dividend trap when it’s actually pretty transparent. Options for long dated vs short dated are interesting as IV is the inverse of most stocks but the spread is MASSIVE so idk of a strategy that’d work on this one
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 13:16:25'] People buy the stock for dividend then dump the stock. Quite literally all its significant downward action YTD is from post dividend. The dividend is unsustainable in the long run, so I wouldn't invest in it. This is all to say, nobody cares about the actual company, just the dividend rate. This is similar with other, more smaller dividend companies, but ZIM being the worst.

POST_TEXT: b"Questions about taxes for this year.\n\nLet's say I started with $5000 in my portfolio. I made $3000 in a stock and realized that and no longer touched that stock (protfolio = $8000). Then, I bought options of Tesla worth the $8000 and sold at a loss of $4000 (-50%). Then, the next day I bought Tesla options again and gained $100 after selling. I then bought spy options for $4000 and sold for a loss of $2000. I then bought spy options again and sold for a loss of $1000, so my account now has $900 from the initial $5000 deposit. I'm curious how capital gains/losses work in this case. Thanks!"
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 18:34:31'] Now I'm just a simple country lawyer, but you lost $4,100. The ups and downs don't matter. And how to claim those losses on your taxes maybe the only area this sub is qualified to give advice on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 18:49:28'] Options will wash if you buy the same contract (same expiration and strike) back after selling for a loss, if you buy a different strike or expiration you're good. Also if you closed all those positions your account would already reflect a wash sale in your trade history or closed positions.I know the first sentence seems very clear cut and matter of fact, but it is literally the only time I have washed an option when I accidentally bought a contract again that I had previously closed. Otherwise I have bought one up or one down on same expiration and no wash.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 09:27:14'] Did you make any more trades after the final losing trade for any stock?  If not and 30+ days has passed then any wash sale will clear . . .If you started the year with $5K and end with $900 then you lost $4100.  Not a tax pro, but you will find out you can write off only $3K of investing losses on your other earned income, but then write the rest off in future years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 18:45:12'] Stock or options don’t make a difference. If it’s a non ira account it’s your total wins or loss that get applied. There are long and short term gains that change the rate of tax and you can only write off 3k of your 4K loss this year. You’ll have to roll the 1100 into the following years tax statement
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 23:32:45'] In my experience broker will report the wash sale if you sell and then buy options with the same strike/expiration. If you want to skirt the wash sale rule, just pick a slightly different strike/expr.I also have some tsla losses I have to harvest by EOY.  I can get around the wash sale by selling my shares and then immediately buy back some DITM leaps call instead.Then next year after a month has passed I can close out those leaps and buy back my shares.

The S&P 500 was -26.78 (.80) after being withing a few dollars of a new high, the Russell -9.57 (.6%), and the only winner the DJ Transports +24.59 (.23%).  Market internals were 1:1 on the NYSE but 1.5:1 down on the NASDAQ.  Volume was slightly higher than average for an August day.  The major feature of the day was the massive selloff in the precious metals.  Gold was down $125/oz. at the low and finished $1946.30 -93.40 (6%) while the Silver was lower by $3.21 to $26.049 after hitting an intraday low of $24.48.  The change at the close was 12%.  I would assume that we would see some follow-thru tonight and tomorrow early, but I bought the NEM Septembe'

The stock is in a down trend on the daily chart and overvalued. While they've made amazing automations and will continue to be leaders in tech beyond auto, calls you don't intend to exercise or role over, i.e. if you're not super long on the company, don't make much sense to me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 10:56:48'] Solid list but I disagree with a few of them or at least think they need more nuance:>4. Make strike price high enough to be unlikely to be hitIf you're getting paid enough at a reasonable strike then there's no reason to be afraid of getting tested or having shared called away. If I can sell a CC at even $1 above my basis and net a decent premium I may be looking at a 5-6% ROI in a month. I'd happily get my shares called away especially if it barely passes my short call, that means I maximized my trade window>7. Shorter expirations can allow for collection of more premiums vs longer expirations (under 30 days)This can be fine, but it also works against point #4. The closer I go to expiration the more likely I am to have my shares called away at a strike that appears too low. This often times leads people to trade far OTM for little premium so they don't get called away or trading too close then having to roll their way out of it because they just wanted high theta decay>9. Don’t trade all of position (ex: 1 contract with 300 shares)This can be fine if you want to layer trades or have an extra round left in the chamber, but I don't think it should be a hard rule. If you listen to your other points (i.e. sell at an amount you don't mind walking away from) then you can do a 3 lot on 300 shares without batting an eye>11. Buy to close at 75% of premiumI completely agree on having a management level. 75% is a little rich for my blood unless I'm either really confident or playing for something like IV crush that may have just happened to coincide with earnings or an event. I like 50%, but as long as you're managing winners I think it's just individual preference. That all said, I think it's great that you're building a framework so you have some mechanical process to make decisions that you can tweak as you learn more and develop a system.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 13:56:34'] Lots of people here critiquing your #9 but after 27+ years of selling options and being successful at it, I'd say it's actually a good guideline to have.  It will help prevent you from having all your eggs in just one basket.  But at a minimum, if you do write calls on all the shares you own of a given stock, I'd suggest you ladder them out with different strikes and different expirations to help you better adjust and respond to various market ups and downs for the underlying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 21:16:43'] #11. I BTC at 66%. That way when I place my limit order I can say “execute order 66” and then I laugh.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 10:39:30'] Should probably track earnings date and IV as well as major market events.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 12:34:56'] You can sell puts to buy the stocks back that you get assigned at a price you're willing to pay + the premium.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 13:20:01'] There may be tax implications (long term/short term holdings)for selling calls that are less than 30dte. This should be researched and understood in relation to your strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 12:49:05'] It makes a difference if you are selling calls on long term holds with a lot of gains you do not want to sell for tax reasons.   In that case sell further otm and accept smaller premiums .I do mostly very long term and even leaps far otm..
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 21:26:07'] I can't really say I like covered calls too much. Because a 15 to 20 percent drop in a bear market can happen fast especially if you're trading individual stocks as opposed to ETFs. And if that happens good luck collecting any premium without having to sell for a loss. If you do trade covered calls make sure you have enough cash to continue averaging your way down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 11:04:16'] You should sell CC (in general sell options) when IV is high. This typically happens on earning dates or after a market drop.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 13:37:45'] \>> 1. Choose strong stock you believe in long term    Buy stocks because of their long term prospects not because the option premium is fat.    \>> 3. Sell covered calls on green days, strike price should be above price per share    Nice in theory but not always practical.  You could miss an opportunity while waiting for that green day and you might wait days or weeks for it.  This is an income strategy and you want to be capturing theta every day.     \>> 4. Make strike price high enough to be unlikely to be hit    This is more applicable for long term investors.  For those seeking maximum ROI, not so much.    \>> 7. Shorter expirations can allow for collection of more premiums vs longer expirations (under 30 days)    Selling a longer expiration provides more premium and more downside protection.  You need to find your sweet spot.  You might consider laddering you CC writes across time and/or strikes.    \>> 9.  Don’t trade all of position (ex: 1 contract with 300 shares)   If your objective is total return, sell CCs against all shares.    \>> 10. Be mindful of ex dividend dates/other dates    The dividend date is irrelevant unless the call is ITM and the amount of time premium is minimal.  Then, it's only relevant if you want to keep the stock.  If that's the case, barring a gap, this should have been dealt with before the call got ITM.    \>> 11. Buy to close at 75% of premium     Not a fan of this one.  Compare the premium per day of the current write versus a later one (same strike).  If you can get more premium per day from a later expiration, roll.  Rolling up and out is a different evaluation.      New ideas:    A) If you achieve some paper gains, consider buying an OTM put to lock them in (conversion to a long stock collar)    B) You don't own a long put (A) so understand the Repair Strategy in case you get modestly whacked and you can't get much of a premium without locking in a loss    C) If IV is reasonable, consider buying a high delta LEAP instead of the stock for risk mitigation (Stock Replacement strategy).

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 16:20:29'] Here is one that is is fairly obvious, but if you're doing this a bunch it's actually easy enough to miss. If you already own the shares and they are down, be mindful of your cost basis. Always make sure the premium you collect puts your breakeven above your cost basis or, if you're looking to trade your way out of a dog of a position, be prepared to babysit it and roll up and out for as long as it takes to recover.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 17:20:51'] All of the above except #9 & #11. If you are selling 1-2 weeks to expiry and following the rest of the rules above, there shouldn’t be any need to BTC. Just let the calls expire. I found you lose more in premium by BTC too much. It makes sense on volatile stocks if you believe the dip is temporary, or getting out of a call you sold much further out (45+ DTE) but for selling weeklies, theta does the work for you unless you sold a riskier strike.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 21:18:54'] I sell CC and have forever and I follow few of those rules. Doesn’t mean they’re wrong, but not my style. My rules:1. Choose a stock you love and believe in. 2. Sell a weekly or monthly call that will give you 2% per week if called away. 3. At expiry, if tested roll out and up, realizing that the further you go up in price, the less premium you are guaranteed in a down turn while the lower you stay the less of any rally you capture. 4. If your stock has dividends, trend flat line as you roll out. This is because the dividend will add to your premium, if you’re called away early you collect your return earlier. 5. If the stock sells off, buy back your call and sit on your hands until your stock rallies enough to pass where it was when you bought it back. This creates alpha within your short leg.6. Never let the tail wag the dog. If you have to take a loss on your short leg to buy it back in a rally, thems the breaks, when the rally cools you’ll make more money timing the new short
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 10:30:47'] No. 5… why would you care about losing the stock? They do pay you for it, you can buy more! Once you make whatever % premium from the sale of the covered call. You should be happy. You maxed out the $$$ that you can make. Let them call the stock and then sit back and reassess where your at an either buy more stock and repeat or buy a different stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 17:28:07'] >Make strike price high enough to be unlikely to be hitIf you do this your premiums are going to be so low why are you even selling CC at all imo. I've tried this strategy, weeklies with a 0.01 or lower theta and guess what, the shares got called away anyways.  I think you have to be prepared to have shares called away at some point, whether its on that call, on one you sell 6 months later. Picking too low of a delta you are just missing out on premiums. My opinion at least.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-20 04:57:54'] I haven’t read through the responses yet so this might have been added. Determine what rate of return you want to achieve with your strategy on an annualized basis. If you want to return 30% for the year then seek a return that achieves that for the period of your option contract. Example: $T trades at $21,50 and the contract expiring 8/5, approximately two weeks from now is $.25 so the return is: .25/21.50 = 1.16%1.16% on an annualized basis is:1 + .0116. = 1.0116 to the 26th power since that is the number of periods in the year. Which is 1.35, approximately. Then minus 1 is an annualized return of 35%. If your goal return is 30% you may want to push out the exercise price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-20 11:11:04'] I'd add: don't buy-write. There are cheaper ways to make money trading credit starting from 100% cash.If you bought AAPl shares 12 years ago and now want to write CCs to trade-off future gains for cash now, that would be fine. But I would not buy 100 shares of AAPL today just to write CCs. I'd do call credit spreads instead or just write naked short puts.Another tip: Recommended entry strike for a CC is 30 delta OTM. That gives you a sweetspot for risk/reward and has been backtested on a variety of credit strategies.For expiration, 45 DTE entry and roll at 15 DTE also has backtested well for a balanced risk/reward. That will keep you aligned to monthly expirations, which generally have better liquidity than weeklies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 19:29:34'] Sometimes it's best to close a position before expiration. To avoid getting assignments or any weird after market moves, specially if you are doing a spread trade
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-20 01:31:11'] You're #4 and #8 contradict each other.  Instead of looking at delta and thinking "30% chance", I try to plan for 30% of my CCs to be called away.  If they do get called away, that just means that you sold them at a price point that you are happy with. Covered calls, by nature, limit your gains, but it helps to remind yourself that you would have sold XYZ as soon as it this price anyway. Don't look back and think about what you could have if you had just held on.... This is s a covered call play, not a long play.    I really like using covered calls as a way to limp out of a position. They allow me to continue lowering my cost average per share while I'm selling. Sideways movers are pretty nice for this.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 13:33:08'] Selling a call is a bearish move, it means you expect the underlying stock to fall. You do not want to be long on theses stocksYou’re logic applies more to cash secured puts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-19 15:16:14'] 12- dont do covered calls. It is a terrible proposition, you end up selling low when the price is high or making nominal returns on a stagnant stock. After a while with low premiums on a stagnant stock everybody starts looking at more volatile names and moves further out to increase the premiums and when the stock you have been holding goes up you miss it, and lock up all the shares for weeks.I strongly suggest reading up on cash covered puts. It is a much safer way to generate revenue. You put up the cash, get a premium back, if the stock stays out of the money you get your cash back, if your put is in the money you get assigned. but as you have gotten the premium, you are buying at a discount, and hold or sell, up to you. using made up numbers - if share Z is $10 and I sell the $9 put and get $1.00 premium - I put up $900 but get $100 back = total spend $800. If Share Z drops to $8.50 and I get assigned, I only paid $800, and I can still sell the shares and come out $50.00 ahead. If it drops to $5.00 then I am holding 100 shares of Z at an unrealized loss, if it is a company you believe in, hold the shares until they come back up or sell them in a covered call.Covered Calls are pushed because they seem like easy money, but they are not, and the bank gets your shares for cheap when the price is high. Cash covered puts are much much more in your favor.

	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 08:26:54'] Buying a put it putting more money into the trade.  The premium on TSLA options is high.  Think of it as buying insurance on a race car.  It might be better to lighten your position size.  If you're determined to hold the shares for tax reasons or whatever, then maybe a put will work better for you.  Remember, whatever you spend on the put should be a loss if all goes well for TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 08:29:55'] Why not sell a call against your shares since premiums are so high?
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 09:05:01'] Selling an OTM covered call will bring in some very nice premium, and if you wanted to cover both directions you can use the credit from the call to buy a long put.Just as a quick example, and not a recommendation, selling a 300 strike call will bring in around $7 in premium, and if the stock goes up above $300 after the ER you stand to make $22 on the stock moving up and can also keep the $7 in premium for a total of $29 in profits, or $2,900 for 100 shares.  If you’re fine owning the stock even if it drops then the $7 will drop your net stock cost on 100 shares to $271.However, if you want to work to protect your shares from a drop in the shares then you can use part of all of the $7 in call premium to buy a long put.  Again, just a quick in analyzed example, a 245 strike put will cost right around $7.Looking at the scenarios, if the stock moves up some but not over $300 then you keep $7, or $700 on profit.If the stock moves up a lot above $300 then you can make $29, or $2,900.However, if you buy the put the amount it may go up in unknown, but the long put didn’t cost you much, and maybe nothing at all.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 12:35:06'] My advice is to not hedge.  If you need this cash in the near future sell your stock.  IMO you shouldn’t own a stock like $TSLA if you are worried about earnings volatility.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 08:28:59'] I think it would make more sense to just sell some shares if you're that concerned. Put contracts bundle shares in groups of 100 so even if you buy one you'd still hold 50 shares that are unhedged. Plus TSLA premiums are always high and even more so before earnings. Either hold it all or sell some would be my advice.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 10:11:11'] Are you trying to increase or decrease your current shares and how long do you want to hold? You're only looking at buying 1 put to hedge most of your shares, it's cheaper to buy one that expires a month after ER, but the best time value is going to be a longer expiration. But if you're bearish, sell those 50 shares now (if it doesn't mess up taxes; if taxes get messed up just sell calls into high IV about 1 standard deviation out (should offset taxes with premiums if it goes up. If it goes down then you reduced your ASP)). Then buy an ITM (LEAP could be a good idea depending on how long you want to be in) put on the remaining and buy a call (shorter term than the put) to capture any upside that might happen from ER (different term than your sold call, typically further out to reduce premiums).
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 12:18:54'] Musk will spew out whatever he has to to keep the stock up.  If anything buy more on a dip.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 17:46:03'] One of two approaches:1) You're a long-term investor, in which case, who cares? Let it ride and just ignore the F out of it.2) You're a short-term trader: This has many possibilities, lighten up your position or close it out entirely. You can always put the trade back on later. Sell the position and buy calls at a level you're willing to suffer loss at (e.g. rather than buying protective puts, buy calls--same difference with limited downside and possibly a cheaper trade). Close the position and do a ratio spread to the upside.Anyway, there are tons of combinations to find. If you believe in the company (good luck with that) then hold on and ride it out bust or...boom? It's still TSLA...anyway, just hold if you believe in it long-term.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 16:14:23'] Sell 50 shares and sell a $5 put spread ATM, that should net you some premium, and then the most you can lose is $500 if it drops. If it goes up, you keep the premium. Expiration this week or next if you wanna be greedy.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 21:05:02'] Why don't you sell covered call? also a vertical put spread. (it's not going to down a lot. May be to 220.)
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-22 11:01:38'] You are holding because you are at a loss, and want to get back to break even or even make a small profit.  I think TSLA is a stock that will go to under $100/share at some point, because they are not profitable without the government subsidy (which is going away).  I will just say to you to sell the stock, walk away with your $10-15/share loss and go into a good business with a good CEO.
	COMMENT: ['2019-04-21 10:06:38'] Just sell all your shares and sideline for earnings unless there's a huge tax consequence.  Tesla could really get hit.  You'll probably have a better chance to buy cheaper shares after earnings if you want to keep accumulating.

I am pretty new to spreads.\n\nCan I maybe just roll over the calls I shorted into a high strike or is that not worth it? what are some good strategies.\n\nThanks!"
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-31 12:31:09'] Jesus, why such a huge strike width? What did you pay for that spread? It's hard to judge how profitable it is without knowing the price you paid.Just close the whole spread if you go over $560. You would have just won the lottery if that happens. Don't get greedy, you can always open a new trade with the profit.Actually, there's an argument for legging out now and just covering the short leg while it is still OTM and relatively cheap. Then you can let the long call ride, if you think going over $560 is likely.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-31 15:15:51'] You seem to be looking at this wrong.  Don't look at how much you are down on your short call.  Don't look at how much it would be to cover your short call.  Look at this trade as a spread only.  The spread on the close was worth about 107, so you are up around 68 on the spread.There are several things you could do here.  Sell the spread and take your profit.  If you are still bullish, you could "roll up" some.  For example, as a spread you could sell out your long 356 calls and buy the 460 calls.  If you did something like this you would then have the 460 / 560 call spread, and you would have taken sold the 356/460 out for 68.  So here you would lock in some of the profit.  It depends on how aggressive you want to be and how much profit you want to take.You could also just sell out some the spreads you have and hold the rest.

This can help you capture some of your losses. Dont go too close to the current price. You can effectively converting your call credit spread into iron condor.2) Pray TESLA goes down from here, which is possible since CPI report is coming out this week. Market might get hammered before or it might go up even higher in anticipation of a lower CPI. So its a 50/503) You can roll your position further out to further expiry like Nov or Dec and go as far otm as you can. You have to take losses now but it increases your chance of profiting from it.4) Just take the L and learn a lesson. &#x200B;Either way there is  a lot to learn for you from this extremely risky trade.

Also the Fed will announce there is a recession on July 28th.  More Elon news will come out. Positive catalystsEvery automaker will sell every EV they make.  Tesla is planning on making the most and have a 1 year backlog on the model Y. I wish the news about Elon would have reduced my wait times it has not. My Feb order planned for Aug has been delayed to November. The delivery reports for tesla are planned for Jan 3rd, Apr 3rd, July 3rd, Oct 3rd.  So Jul 3rd will not be great.  I expect October to be good and Jan to be off the charts with Texas and Berlin to be ramped to 5k per week.  Also Tesla is announcing split. My own strategy which is not financial advice. Wait for them to announce the recession on Jul 28. The Q2 financials and Q2 earnings have past. And then mid August buy calls.  I bought calls last year in June and rode the Q3 and Q4 deliveries and dumped them 800C 6/22. 80k calls sold for 400k. It was pretty sweet. When TSLA doubled the calls 5x. Of course this is gambling. And the majority of my holdings are in the stock which is investing. Short term PE is compressing. Long term EPS Cars*ASP 50k, 20% margins:2020 ~0 EPS (500k cars built)2021 $6 (930k)2022 $15 (1.5M: 600k, 800k, 50k, 50k)2023 $25 (2.5M: 600k, 1M, 450k, 450k)2024 $36 (3.6M: 600k, 1M, 1M, 1M)These estimates are just based on the current factories. In 2024 Shanghai 2, Texas 2 and Berlin 2 Maybe producing cars. Shanghai they bought a second piece of land.  Texas and Berlin have room to expand. 40 PE 2023 = $1000, 40 PE 2024 is $1440. Or use your own PE.  Happy hunting

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-25 06:10:19'] Keep in mind that TSLA's call options are more expensive than many stocks. Even after the split, a single call contract close to the money will set you back more than $4,000 (because right now it will set you back more than $20,000). And the call will be loaded with premium and subject to substantial time decay. If TSLA continues to run as it has recently, it will validate all of these high costs. But that is a big risk.For expensive stocks like this traders often use Call Debit Spreads (same expiry) OR Put Credit Spreads (pretty close to the same bet) where cost is reduced to a fraction of a direct call but profits are capped.  (I am not recommending the spreads by the way in the case of TSLA, but it is the standard way of getting cash requirements way down for expensive stocks).Keep in mind that TSLA will still be at $400 per share plus after the split.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 20:40:36'] Don’t count on SPY dropping in the long term, by any definition. Also, never “salvage” anything. What’s done is done. Look at the next play. Thinking in terms of reversing a loss is dangerous.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 21:19:51'] "feel obligated to do something", that's how you blow up accounts. If you want to hedge at least let SPY do a relief rally, dont buy puts when most of the "down leg" is formed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 20:43:11'] There are all kinds of hedges and they provide different amounts of protection and their cost varies.      A covered call caps the upside but only provides a modest amount of downside protection.    A protective put is a more effective hedge but the tradeoff is a lot of drag on a portfolio.  Lower cost protection can be had by buying a bearish put spread but that offers only modest protection.    Collared stock or options can be done for little to no cost but it requires capping the upside.  The OTM covered call pays for an OTM long protective put.  It sets a range of upside profit and limits the downside loss.    Even calendar spread can be used for a modest amount of hedging.      It all depends on what you're willing to give up in return for locking in gains and/or limiting loss.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 22:03:07'] Hedge when things are good and buy when things are bad, you’re far better off dropping 100k on a long term long position than short term short.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 20:53:33'] If you're a high roller then you should be talking to a real financial advisor, not reddit, but I generally don't recommend hedging with long term puts.  You can use 1 /ES future to hedge (the equivalent of) 500 shares of SPY for $20k buying power or less.  It moves $50 per S&P point, and futures have no pesky theta.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 00:35:44'] Have you beta weighted your portfolio? That will give you a good idea of how much delta you need to long/short to reach full coverage hedges. Not that you need to be delta neutral, but it will give you an idea of the max numbers involved.You said you're playing with a "high six figure portfolio" which would put you in the neighborhood of 10% portfolio risk with a single 100k position. I'm kinda stoned, and highly risk averse, but that's A LOT of eggs in one basket for a speculative play to counteract unrealized losses. You did mention your gambling past time...

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 03:50:25'] 6 months out SPY puts or even calls are really expensive tho. Seems like quite significant amount of premium to pay for either way
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 05:12:42'] If you look at most QQQ midcaps, they are beaten down horribly and there is not much room to fall. Megacaps still have downside potential but at some point the sellers will exhaust themselves.I'd take the opposite trade and start selling puts. Especially on stocks you don't mind to own. Imo the current environment is perfect to start the options wheel strategy. You'll start to acquire positions at the (potential) end of a multi-month bear market, and by selling puts you even enter below current market value. Some value stocks are at ridiculous prices now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 14:09:24'] With that amount of capital and positions, I’d run the wheel. Sell cash-secured puts. If assigned, sell covered calls. DYOR. But buying puts ironically sounds like a FOMO move in this market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-15 05:16:50'] Why not do an easier hedge.  So many people are so gung ho with SPY.  Hedge with VIX.  VIX is designed to be mean reverting and when SPY goes down, VIX goes up most times than not.  I don't know how technical you want to get, but a very easy strategy would be to buy some 30-60 day out calls on VIX when it touches the lower Bollinger Bands and sell them when it inevitably trampolines back up to mid-high 20s.  A less technical aspect is zoom out on the Weekly.  You will notice that over the past 2-3 years, every time $VIX has gotten to about 18-20 it bounces right back over $25.  It happens every 30 days roughly.  Boom, easy hedge and you don't have to worry about monitoring what the Fed is doing, what the other sectors are doing.  Just be as mechanical as you can.  VIX hits lower BB or touches $20, you buy some calls or call debit spreads and sell when they get to around $28 or more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 21:09:42'] An idea is sell upside on pops and sell puts at support closer dated to harvest iv to fund longer dated puts. Like a collar but long downside convexity for tail risk or liquidity crisis

Feels like a slow mo crash, you know it's happening, but you just let it...It is a slow-mo crash until its not. It has been tortuous all the way down because the upwards percentage rallies have actually EXCEEDED the total down bear movement, that is until last Friday. The fact is, you already know the economy is in a mess and things look worse, not better. Given that's the case, the current down moves actually haven't been too bad because dip buyers got rewarded the whole way down since January and late put buyers got smashed despite this being a down market. "Short covering rallies" or however youd like to describe it. The bottom line is there will be a moment that there will NOT be short covering rallies and there will NOT be a relief rally, and that everyone trying to long a dead cat bounce will get smashed beyond smithereens. However, when is that moment? You will not know. February SPY puts is probably the safest way to play this although dollar cost averaging in will be smarter than all at once. I have no guarantees that tomorrow isn't "the day" but you have to go with statistics and just assume "the day" is later on and therefore DCA into your put plays is the smarter thing to do. I would DCA over a period of 2 weeks to a month so give yourself some breather, and please do Februaries.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-14 20:44:08'] With IV high I think you’d be better off selling some OTM calls to collect premium and reduce you cost basis.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 07:38:30'] I am a contrarian of the Reddit hive mind’s opinion on Cramer, and get downvoted. Few view him as an asset into what institutions are thinking. Cramer does a great job of generalizing what Wall Street is thinking right now, and projects the intentions of the general fund managers, and does a good job of summarizing the market sentiment. You don’t ever have to follow whatever he says, but there will always be a counterpart to your trade, and wouldn’t you rather know the strategy of the other side?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 06:55:33'] Every few months someone does an analysis on Cramer. Yeah it’s cool to see the results but it misses the point of his show completely. If you’d listen to the show you’d notice two things. 1. He consistently repeats that you should not be blindly buying all his picks, the show is a platform to hear lots of names and get ideas. 2. The people calling in tend to be working class boomers who like having their hand held. Even Cramer says not to listen to Cramer. There’s a group of people who like hearing his advice and want the volume of names that he covers. Shitting on him doesn’t make you look smart of insightful, just another shill in the Reddit echo chamber that missed the nuance completely

His job is to talk about new stocks every day. The demand of needing new picks every day invariably means most will be losers. Can you imagine if he just got on TV every day and only talked about FAANG names? “Yep, guys, I’m still bullish on Apple, just like yesterday!” P.S. Stop watching financial media.

Please note Jim Cramer is in the entertainment business and needs to have daily content and lots of it now that he is so often on CNBC.  So, take everything with a grain of salt, he will look great on some trades and silly on others.  So, use it just like you use Reddit, in one ear and out the other, but once in awhile……

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 10:01:33'] Nice analysis, but how much of that short term performance is directly affected by his show. He says buy and a bunch of people buy the next day causing the price to go up and visa-versa for sell… In my very amateur opinion we you’ve really shown here how easily the market can be manipulated by the right players using the right medium. What we the rating for his show? How many of those viewers are blindly following his “advice”? Is it enough to effect the price of the stones he’s recommending? I think the real question is are his recommendations what he actually thinks about the stocks or just what he wants from the stocks? I think Cramer creates sentiment based on what he (or other powers that be) need from specific stocks. But again, I’m far from a professional trader and really have no idea what I’m taking about.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 11:00:23'] Given the method of taking the stock at the open price, isn't it possible that we're actually just seeing a tiny pump and dump effect (that is, Cramer being positive/negative on a stock has a very negligible affect that adds up over time as opposed to Cramer is able to beat the market by 10x?). Cramer says stock X is bad and it opens at $10. Random person sees this news and decides to sell at $9.90 to get out of their position. Voila, Cramer became a self-fulfulling prophecy. Which is why the trend doesn't work for any period longer than a day -- by then the market has already corrected itself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 11:11:46'] I’m curious for the 1 day recommendation, Mad Money airs after market close so you would have to buy stock/options at next days open the earliest. Do you account for this? Make sure your not buying at the close the day of the recommendation and selling it at the close the next day because this is unfeasible.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 11:26:52'] OP, are the picks just the ones he does features on, or just the ones he “blesses” when people call in? He has noted that he only really believes in the stocks he features. I’m not a Cramer shill, but just mentioning it.

What did the prices do a week after this? Did it correct? Continue up? I’m curious if you corrected for his initial guidance what you might find. To me, this data shows he has impact on short term price movements, but nothing validating long term
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 14:00:40'] Have you tracked Cramer's charitable trusts rate of return? This information would be useful as it shows where Jimmy Chill is putting is money to work.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-06 22:38:14'] You should state the statistical error (or better, the statistical significance) on the percentage correct calls. E.g. For 11k 1-day buy call events with roughly 5.5k successes, a simple Poisson error on the successes would be sqrt(5.5k) = 74, giving a 1-sigma absolute error on the success rate of 74/11k = 0.7%. That's similar to the excess (over 50%) correct calls observed. Fold in the 5 yr bull market underneath that must feed into even 1-day changes, and not accounted for, I would be uneasy about the statistical significance.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 20:11:23'] Everyone's talking about what happens if the underlying drops, but I'd also be worried about the opposite. If you're trying to repeat this strategy, what happens if the underlying skyrockets? You miss out on so much profit that a non-options buy-and-hold strategy would beat. This strategy caps your potential upside. Not saying I don't like covered calls in the right context, but this is also a risk you take.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 20:20:13'] "with no chance of loss"I have a better chance at getting laid than you have trading Covered Calls with no chance of loss. But bruv, if you long 100 shares of Tesla at $810 and sell a contract for $2,300 your net outlay is going to be $78,700. Every point Tesla drops is -$100 so if Tesla drops 23 points then you are at your breakeven. If Tesla drops say 40 points for example you now have a loss of -$2,700 and seeing how Tesla can drop 400 points in a month shows there is significant downside risk. Sure you can buy back your short call and sell another call at a lower strike but you risk getting your shares called back below your basis cost. Covered calls are not a trading cheat code and they can be very dangerous if you play high volatility stocks like Tesla. Dont be seduced by fat premiums, there's a reason they are so high.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 21:23:07'] Good catch.  Glad the professionals never caught on in the past 200 yrs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 20:23:09'] This works if tsla trades sideways or up, if it keeps going down, your premiums will also start to drop.  Imagine buying 100 shares of tsla when it peaked around 1200, your 1 week covered call is going for $0.03 right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 21:38:58'] Your first problem, as others point out, is choosing TSLA as a good buy/write candidate. Do you want to own TSLA? is the real question. If you're just looking to trade options irrespective of an underlying, there are much better tickers to play with. Second, if your account is $100K, staking 81% of it on one paired trade is your major philosophical problem, especially with the mood of the market right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 00:51:31'] It’s losers’ strategy. You either can’t pick a stock that has significant upside, or miss out all the upside when stock explodes (say TSLA goes to $1200). And you are exposed to all the downside, the “premium” you collect is no protection when the stock crashes. Often time this strategy makes you profit in 10 months, then lose all the profit on the eleventh month
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 17:47:21'] Sure, until it reaches a peak. After you chase those calls up to 1100. Then tanks to 800.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 19:25:23'] I have been selling covered calls for a while but recently I went to a more aggressive covered call strategy to see if i can gain some of my losses on bad decions like Tilray. My account is not much more than yours.  I look for beaten up stocks that don't have too much downside (i hope). I'm bringing in about $500 a week  just on premium not including gains from stocks being called. I have about 10 stocks im playing,  trying to staying diversified.  My goal is to pick more right than wrong. So far doing well. My bad picks right now are clov and fubo,  Would love to buy fubo now at this price but I already have 700 shares. Still making good premium on it and hope it doesn't run on me goo fast. My winners so far are M, BBBY, VALE, CLF, BGFV SOFI,  CGC.  Rolled a few up and out but I find that is a mistake in most cases for me. Let it get called away and find a lower entry or new play.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 22:15:12'] If you’re determined to play this game, buy a protective put at maybe $780 for $1400. Now your profit is only $900, but if tsla drops below your cost basis the put will increase enough (via IV and Greeks) that you’ll at least break even.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 23:05:44'] It is best to do this for stocks you are 100% comfortable holding despite any crazy swing. Sure you might make $2k but if Tesla drops to 10% you lose $10k in a week type of thing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 18:56:59'] There's a few criteria you want to take into account when choosing to sell a covered call. The most important is to understand that you don't buy a stock with the sole purpose of selling a covered call on it. You want to buy a stock that you would outright buy 100 shares of regardless, and then determine the optimal approach toward selling your call. For instance, if you buy TSLA at $800, you want to research and answer the question of where you think it is going in the short term. Do you think it will rally throughout the next few weeks? Probably shouldn't sell a covered call. Do you think there is the possibility of a large negative catalyst that makes it see a significant (10%+) decline? Maybe consider just selling the stock. $2300 of premium is really nothing compared to TSLA's overall movement. That's only a 3% move afterall. If you believe TSLA will remain relatively flat or if you believe volatility is too high, then that may be a good time to sell a covered call, but you don't want to blindly sell covered calls just because you own 100 shares of something because in the long term it will never overtake the amount of money you are losing or missing out on from holding the underlying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 17:51:05'] If the stock falls to $750, you lose $3700.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 18:02:52'] No guarantee the premium willAlways be $23
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 20:16:05'] Wheel strategy is one of the most idiotic strategy. The majority of the risk is in stock. If someone is betting on stock coming back to the same price, a naked put which is rolled, till you are right, may perform better. Of course there will hardly any time premium in the deep ITM puts, but it will behave very much like a future contract with much less capital needed than a wheel stock holding.Once the price is significantly down in any secured call strategy, you have this dilemma of whether to sell near ATM to gain some significant premium or wait for stock to recover before selling (which may never happen).

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 21:48:40'] It can be a decent strategy if you have the resolve to hold the underlying long-term if it suddenly tanks, and don't hold regrets over locking your max profit via the covered call.There's 3 ways this plays out:1. Underlying shits the bed, you realize a profit on the contract since it closes OTM, but you're in the hole on the shares. New contracts, if you want to write them above your cost basis, will be way less than before.2. Underlying goes to the moon. You realize a small profit on the shares, and keep the premium from the contract. Now you're stuck deciding whether the new share price is worth buying back in, so your strategy is dead in the water.3. Underlying closes between your cost basis and strike. This is your best case scenario where you get to keep the shares, premium, and then get to write a new contract.Edit: If you REALLY want to give this a go, I'd strongly suggest starting with a CSP instead and do the wheel strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 00:24:36'] No, you don't have it correct.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 06:27:22'] You can guarantee a no loss ONLY if you've sold enough covered calls where the accumulated premiums over time is > than the principle you paid for the shared.This takes a while and a bit of luck but once that happens, it's essentially free money.For example if you did this with meme stocks all of last year, your cost basis in theory should be in the negative.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 21:50:10'] Jesus, stay away from trading if you really think theres a no-loss strategy. lmao.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 19:00:36'] Your understanding is correct.  If you get a bad entry when buying shares, you may end up selling a CC below cost basis at some point in order to get decent premium.  Then you’re in a pickle if the stock rallies above your strike price, or are left  holding shares that continue to lose value.  Just look  at TSLA’s chart over the past year to get an idea for how this would have worked out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 21:32:34'] Best way to learn is to do it, then you'll understand the pros and cons. I was doing the same with bitfarms, thinking I would sell the high and buy back the calls on the dip. It was all good til it kept dipping and dipping. Now I'm just bag holding, down about 50% and there's no way I'm selling calls while I'm down so much and risk getting assigned. I'm still bullish on bitf, otherwise I would have never done it though..so all is good, lesson learned.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 21:45:03'] Im seeing a lot of people bring up the scenario of Tesla dropping, but let's say I use OPs covered call strategy and buy Tesla puts at the same time in order to minimize the exposure in the case where Tesla drops. Would that work? Of course I would still lose money on the premium but it won't be as much as purely using covered calls without any downside protection.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 22:44:42'] Scenario 1 you buy Tesla at $800 and you sell covered calls at strike price $815. Stock goes to $2000 per share. You’re forced to sell your stocks at $815 or pay a huge amount of money to close the calls. That’s missing out on huge profits.Scenario 2 you buy Tesla at $800 and you sell covered calls at strike price $815. Stock drops to $200. You lose shit ton of money regardless because you have so much money in it.Covered calls in many cases are really a tool to hedge instead of profiting. It depends on the volatility of the stock.Source: I’ve been in both scenarios 1&2 so trust me bro
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 01:10:42'] Sounds Too good to be true, doesn't it?  When you think you have an "always win" strategy, don't. There is no such thing as free money or you figured it out while others haven't. What if TSLA tanks to 400? You're screwed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 10:21:17'] I'll share my story since I experienced the "worst" case scenario with this strategy. I too had this realization a couple weeks ago. The key is to choose a stock you truly believe in and wouldn't mind holding if you had to.I've always been a fan of Roku (not here to debate on stock picks lol). So instead of just buying the shares I opted to "wheel in" (see wheel strategy) by selling cash-secured put. So basically I collect premium, if the stock hits the strike I get assigned the shares for each contract. I sold 2, 1 @ $150 and $139. This was the week of Roku earnings...Come earnings Roku dumped, I got assigned 200 shares with the average price of $137 but Roku ended that week @ \`$112-ish so I'm down a good chunk but it's not realized. I'm a little sad but I believe in Roku and this is the best part of this strategy, I haven't really lost, I can now sell Covered Calls, now granted it sucks because I need to sell above my average price and since I'm so far out the money the premium isn't great but I can still make something. Fast forward to now (just go look at the Roku charts). I'm back in the green, collecting the big premiums for the weekly Covered Calls, and I might get exercised which means I'll just repeat it all again.  tl;drSold cash-secured puts on Roku, "worst" case scenario happened, Roku dumped. Got assigned 200 shares, sold covered calls, Roku recovered. I'm back in a perfect position. My only recommendation is don't buy the shares out-right. Sell cash-secured puts to get into them so you can take even more premium, double dip!&#x200B;Final Note: People say, "but what if it blows up and you miss out on all the gains." Ignore them, they're not understanding your goals. I have a different account for my buy and holds to the moon. My goal with this account is to generate a monthly dollar amount and as long as I'm doing that. I'm winning.

You can continue selling calls but will have to lower your strike price to get a decent amount of premium.  One potential scenario is TSLA miraculously recovers to $800 the day after you sell a $720 call then you will have to either sell and be locked in for a loss or continue rolling the expiration date further into future to avoid selling your shares (you will get some premium each time you roll).  Another scenario is TSLA slowly recovers in value but never hits your strike and you continue collecting profit and calls expiring worthless until you have exceeded original cost basis

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 05:59:56'] Yeah, it’s a perfect strategy so long as you don’t care about downside risk in the underlying equity. For a $2300 credit, you are subject to significant value loss in the $TSLA shares. That said, if the price of the underlying goes significantly south, you can generally buy-to-close for a fraction of your premium. You will have then booked a profit on the option and a (probably larger) loss on the equity. If you’re bullish on the stock in the long-term and fine to hold the shares through ups _and_ downs, CCs are a fine strategy for reducing cost basis. Just don’t sell strikes that would put your returns below the cost of shares minus the premiums you’ve collected.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 06:18:44'] That’s how I started trading options as well, I’ll tell you what I would tell my old self if I could do it again:Yes your logic is correct, BUT the market can (and probably will at some point) act against you. read more about the wheel strategy (is nothing new) essentially you’re selling secured puts when the prices go up and then covered calls when the prices go down. The issue is when the stock peaks or bottoms:Let’s say you make money on the rise weekly then the stock reverses, you’ll buy the stock more expensive than the price on market, and you’ll already be at a loss trying to make it up selling covered calls, in order for you to offset the loss you’ll need to sell options with a price almost in the money (ITM) which means that it could reverse and you be assigned to sell lower than the market, losing yet again. Recommendation: get yourself a good investing course, or read all the links in this reddit, especially if you have 100K to start a portfolio, and if you want to try your strategy out, use a paper money account first, otherwise you might lose easily 50% of your starting capital. Plan to become a true trader, its a discipline, not someone that just makes a couple of bucks more per week, it’s attractive but won’t scale. And you might lose more money in the long run.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 07:39:50'] You can do this. Don't expect the same numbers every time. Don't be greedy. Watch the price constantly.  Study it. Get a feel for which way its going. Maybe don't keep the Call price so close to share price. Take a smaller premium so you end up in the money less often.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 07:44:12'] Okay yeah math makes sense right but now you have to factor in the growth of the stock and potential loss ~ if the stock stays around the same level it’ll print money BUT premiums aren’t good for low volatility equities on my list ~  if it goes up you miss out anything above strike+premium that’s the positive risk - negative risk is where it shits the bed goes lower than avg price - premium then you’re fucked - I did the same for INTC earnings and then realized TD DI requires a higher margin level account for naked calls and csp’s I would have made 1 and got destroyed for it 🥴

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 09:17:42'] Say it with me. . .There is absolutely no strategy that has no chance of loss.Covered calls have a lower chance of loss, I'll give you that.  In an ideal world you would buy a stock, sell the first OTM call and the price would stay exactly the same forever allowing you to rinse and repeat with no chance of failure.  The real world is far from ideal, using your TSLA example last week you would have had a range of 700 to 856, your 815 CC would have done fine.  Then you have this week where it looks like TSLA is having a face-ripping up move where you'd sell your CC but if this continues through the week it'll cost you more than that 2300 plus your initial 81,000 to buy back in.There are no guarantees, an outsized move in either direction could ruin your plan.  I've seen mention of cash secured puts which is a good plan, just sell puts at the price you'd like to buy at until you are a proud new TSLA owner.  You could also consider selling a further OTM CC, when doing this I like to look around 20-30 delta (as I'm looking at TSLA right now with it trading at 862 that would be a CC somewhere in the 900 - 920 range).

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 10:39:50'] Started this strategy last week.  If you make 1% a week a 2k account will hit 2 million in 12 years.  I made 2.1% last week and 2.7% This week, which, if repeatable, is 4-5 years to a million.  I think diversification is your key.  I have a small account, so I put $ into 4 stocks and left some money for straight options plays.  Had I timed it better ,I would have made 4% this week, but it's a busy day at my real job.  The risk is your holdinga lose value and you can't sell options above your basis for any real money.  Hopefully some diversity mitigates this.  Also, you can buy back options before you have to take a full bath on the stock.  Check back in 5 years to see if I made a Milly or not 😉

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 16:38:15'] You can always buy a far OTM protective put with a portion of the premium received to limit your downside risk. This is really only useful if there is a flash crash.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 19:54:15'] If the underlying drops you have a difficult choice to make. Sell the next covered call way out of the money and receive little premium, don't sell any and make no premium while you wait for a reversal, or sell a covered call close to the money and risk incurring a big realized loss if it shoots up again and you get assigned below your cost basis. I use covered calls, but there is risk involved as with everything in the stock market. I would also recommend always rolling your calls to avoid assignment if you can take a credit without pushing it out more than \~45 days.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 06:17:07'] To be clear, I believe covered calls is getting a premium, hoping for the stock to stay under the strike price. But if it passes the strike price, you have to minus the difference of the premium.Example: you bought 100 shares at 800. You sell a call at 810 strike at 23.00. +2,300Price jumps to 810. You get paid +1000 for the sale shares called away. 810 strike is at 28.00. +2,800.The contracts gets bought back.2,300-2,800 is -$500 then you +1000.Total profit is $500.Let me know if I’m wrong if the price is at 800 on expiration date you may collect the whole premium.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 11:16:07'] You're on the right path.  But the number 1 rule is never let your shares get purchased.  You never want hold the same contract anywhere close to expiry.   For example.  If you sell a contract for 23.00 per share and bring in $2,300 in premium.  You will watch the stock for the next couple days. If it stays at a similar share price, that contract will be worth less each day(thus making you a profit).  A professional trader will buy back that contract on Tuesday or  Wednesday for $1,700 or $1,200  - making  $600 - $1,100 profit. Then sell another contract and repeat.  Again, the number 1 rule - DO NOT let your shares get exercised and ideally, don't own the same contract anywhere close to expiry.   Further example, based on the scenario above.  You sell a contract brining in $2,300 premium.  on Wednesday the share price has increased to $814. You now but back that contract ... given the time decay, it may only cost you $2,400-$2,500 ( could be slightly more)  Then immediately sell a $820 for the following Friday bringing in $2,500.  (This being called a roll over) Stock price stays the same or goes down, you win on the premium (but lose on the stock price.  This is why you should choose a stock which you want to hold long termStock price goes up, you need the liquidity to roll over to a future date.  you lose a bit on the buy back, but gain on rolling over to a future date (plus have the increased stock price in your portfolio)  The method described above is not a get rich quick system. it's slow, safe and methodical generating a few thousand dollars per month. &#x200B;I'll take it one step further, and probably be downvoted to oblivion.    $GME is a highly volatile and heavily discussed stock on Reddit.  With $100,000 you could purchase 800 shares (stock trading at $120)  Weeklies at $128 for this Friday are 4.80 last sale price ( $480 per contract x 8 contracts = $3,840)  I only own 50 GME shares, but i will tell you, Options are tempting given the volatility and options pricingWith $TSLA you are putting all eggs in one basket (in order to get the 100 shares necessary)You could purchase 500 $GME shares as well as 10 $GOOG shares.  In July GOOG does a 20-1 stock split and voila, you now own 200 shares of GOOG which you can implement the same strategy as above. Myself, I use the strategy above, but I've picked some long term growth stocks in a TFSA, so I'll be ready in a few years to really capitalize on monthly income.  $SOFi is one that I just purchased at the $10.60.  Once this one grows over $20, it will generate enough options pricing for me to sell contracts.  In my standard investment account I pull in $1,000 per month just having fun with selling contracts.. however, the past 6 months have been great.. the market is turning the other direction and I've purchased some contracts... longer term, so I can sell poor man covered calls while the market goes the other way. Good luck to you. You are on the right path.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-28 15:15:00'] I’ve always posed a similar argument for SPY. Why wouldn’t I write ATM calls to generate income. The strategy is all about cash flow and less about building equity in the underlying asset. No one has ever given me a good answer. People always say “what if SPY falls 30%”. Like uh okay well if I was just buying and holding spy, I would also be down 30% so what is the argument? If anything, I’ll lose 2% less because of the premium collected. The only “downside” is you could miss a huge upward movement and be stuck with just your premium but that’s the price you pay for the cash flow income generation. Rather collect my 2% a month or whatever than sit around trying to play what-if.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 11:55:39'] A while ago someone posted asking for a list of overpriced stocks and I couldn't think of any, even including ENPH.Is ENPH overpriced? On a purely fundamental basis, there are a lot of red flags in the profitability and valuation DD:https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ENPH/summary?search=ENPHBut if you compare that profile to other momentum stocks with macro-level tailwinds, it doesn't look that bad. It looks pretty average on that basis, and compared to GME and AMC, it looks like a solid gold winner, lol.Can you come up with bear scenarios? Sure, easy. Cost of credit is still rising and big solar projects need a lot of debt-based funding to get off the ground, so you'd think there'd be a slowdown. But so far, that's not showing up in ENPH's quarterlies.So my basic rule is, even if the DD says danger ahead, I don't bet against momentum.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 21:50:22'] Definately looking overvalued, but they ARE profitable and are having what looks to be a record year. Next quarter is projected to be phenomenal as well. It’s weird to see companies in this market trading over 100 times full year earnings earnings (they’re looking like they’ll make $300 million this year ) there’s nothing that says this stock has to go down. This wasn’t even on my radar but now it’s looking like an intriguing possibility. They have about $1 billion in cash on hand.If they weren’t profitable yet and had a less cash on the balance sheet it would be a no brainer, but they aren’t at risk of going bankrupt, they’re making decent money (25% margins is decent I guess nowadays?) and they’re actually growing by leaps and bounds.You’re basically betting that some black swan event occurs that stops people from installing solar, slowing house builds isn’t enough clearly because housing starts have already slowed and it’s not translating over to Enphase, in fact it’s the opposite, they’re going to have a record year.Tough call.. LOTS of meat on the bone, I could see them easily dropping to $30 a share and no one else would bat an eye in this market.The other Con about buying outs is how expensive they are, $4.00 for May $120 puts??? There’s not a single contract on that chain that’s a decent risk reward, I’m specifically looking for sub $1.00 options and the chain doesn’t even go that low. If you could get mid to low $200 strikes for under $1.00 I’d probably be down, but no way I’m putting up $2200 on something that would have to move TWO standard deviations just to break even.You won’t start making intrinsic profit until $269… AND you have to risk a shitload of cash for the privilege.Anyway, no one knows what it’s gonna do, it’s probably not for me, but it wouldn’t surprise me in the least to see the stock at $150 and dropping. Just not a good enough risk/reward for me to out real money into it

As you move further from that point in time, so does your plan’s “fit” with reality. Knowing your risk appetite, entry price, exits are called “targets” for a reason - sometimes things miss. So yes - have a plan, know your hard limits, have a realistic idea of what will make it a successful trade, know where you can be flexible,  and understand how shifting strategy “in-flight” affects risk and success factors. If you shift strategy mid-trade - are you exposing yourself to greater risk and thus require greater reward? Know when shifting strategy becomes chasing a trade. If you shift to much, your plan turns to hope - and hope is not a strategy.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 15:58:32'] DO NOT PANIC.Emotions are responsible for more poor trading decisions than you can imagine.You knew the risk and defined it at trade open. You can reduce delta exposure by selling a call spread OoTM to reduce your delta by 50% if you are aggressive, or by 25% if you are more bullish on TSLA in general. Reducing delta with a call spread will add up side risk in the event of a whipsaw to the upside, but will provide additional credit to extend the breakeven to the downside.Another option - totally valid - is to do nothing until the last 7-14 days prior to expiration. If this trade is still not working, but you can roll for a credit, simply close the front month, and sell the same spread in the next monthly cycle. You can roll positions each monthly cycle as long as you are collecting a credit. It gets harder to do with spreads, but especially with naked short options, they can usually roll for a credit even when they are at the +/-90 delta.Has your fundamental opinion of TSLA changed since you put the position on?Just remember that you have time on your side, and your loss is defined by the width of the spread minus the credit received.

Current batteries aren't sufficient for energy storage on a large scale (though most home systems do use batteries for storage) so advances in batteries could be renewable energy positive.Also any advancement in batteries that doesn't directly affect large scale power storage does not mean you can't still use renewable energy to charge those batteries. But more electric vehicles and more efficient ways to replace fossil fuel driven systems means less demand for oil.I don't really see any direct affects in the short term on the energy sector though.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 17:23:55'] Definitely thinking there is some IPO hype into this one. Up to $173 today and like you sd nvr sold anything. If the first earnings comes out it will be most likely like many industries… “supply chain”… this shit will look like PTON after earnings… PUT away imo…Fyi.. those PUTS are expensive! Lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 18:12:17'] Puts are expensive. You open yourself up to IV crush. I opened a small call credit spread when rivian was at 165 today. I’m prepared to double down if it continues to go up. I.e if it goes up another 15%, I’ll add more CCS.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 19:33:22'] The EV market is retarded. It makes me angry how retarded these investors are. If Ford was to stop selling gas vehicles and only sell electric vehicles would that make them a $100+ bn company as well?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 17:26:45'] The stock will drop once the IPO unlocks and  the shares can be sold. Until then it will hold. See when that date is. For most retail users thats at least 30 days. For insiders that could be a few months.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 17:28:59'] Be careful. The retail herds going in right now are not looking at the market cap as importantly as you are. They think this will go up in the same way as Tesla did, so their priority right now is to not miss out this time and to just hold. Too risky to bet with a put right now unless the fed comes up with something that will make these rividiots and lucidiots to rethink.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 17:49:37'] Remember when I LCID hyped up to $60 before the official SPAC announcement? Then it crash to $17 because it was the valley period of EV cycle and TSLA dipped by almost 50% too. I guarantee Rivian will go to $40, but nobody know when is the next valley of EV cycle

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 19:56:01'] Normally I only buy stocks after pullbacks to some support level, but RIVN just keeps going up every day. There has been some intraday pullback activity but it's been short lived. I have been selling some F and TSLA and moving the money into RIVN during the intraday weakness, as it seems F and TSLA have been getting tired. So far, RIVN isn't getting tired, yet. It's acting like a meme stock. The valuation doesn't seem to have any meaning and the buyers keep on buying. I am done with my RIVN buying for now and will just try to be patient. There is clearly a FOMO component to this move. I don't think it's possible for anyone to know where the top will be before the stock settles down. The current IV is ridiculous, so people are will to pay a LOT of premium for the options.

At least toyota is taking the time to make good battery, hybrid, hydrogen, ice cars that last and won't blow up your ass. Even at this price i would buy rivian lcid over Ford and Gm.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 20:05:08'] I think the thing to do is wait for a 30-50% pullback and buy shares if you are long RIVN or LCID for the long term.  You'll have to suffer through some lean months (perhaps even years) and your position will likely be in the red. Moreover it's unlikely you'll buy at the absolute low.  RIVN might come down 30%, you buy at 120 (and not where it is now at 172)..and then it will drop again to 90 or 80 and you'll have to have patience while the rebound or retracement up takes another year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 20:06:50'] I would say sell a CSP at a price that you think you would be ok owning. If you think it is too high now, what is a good price?Or sell a call spread but that means you have to time it well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 20:56:47'] Better play is to wait for higher delta strikes to be introduce on further expiries, and then opening put zebras to synthetically short with defined risk and less/no extrinsic exposure.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-16 21:19:45'] My favorite strategy for short these meme is selling a iron condor 1-2 month out with profit zone between pre parabolic price and slightly off current peak. Due to insane IV the profit and loss ratio is extremely favorable, and you can’t be margin call or theta crush. but don’t expect to make Max profit. Cover your IC as soon as price drop to the max theoretical return price of the current date because price will often keep dropping and less predictable.

If it hits $200 I might try my luck with some $200/150 jan put spreads if I can get a decent price. I'm also watching LCID closely to short it, $60-75 seems like a potential top.

If anything I think the market will treat this like the "TESLA ETF"... and pump this stock way over it's value as being representative of overall market direction. I personally think their valuation is fair at this price considering the upside...Remember, RIVIAN is the old guard's (ie Ford & Chevy) answer to TSLA it has major backing of the too big to fail auto giants. This company is going to MURDER the competition. An aspirational branded EV company who offers compelling EVs at a relatively competitive price. SUVs and trucks are THE mainstream vehicle platform. Look at job postings and the expirence of those people who work for them. They've done an incredible job at poaching employees in the EV space. Talent is top tier and they've tapped into a 150 year old supply chain network. There's no stopping RIVIAN...

Also sell 1 credit spread above your call.&#x200B;Just make sure your loss from the credit spread is less than the max gain from the straddle at that price or it will go your way and you will lose money
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-28 05:21:15'] What you need to realize is how insanely expensive each one of these three options is.  Calls are priced such that most of the time even if the stock goes in the right direction you will only break even or make a small profit.  You need TSLA to go to 1100 or 650 just to break even.  If you want to double your money you need it to go to 1400 or 500.  So you're risking losing $30,000, and you need the stock to make an enormous move just to get that money back.  That's why no one buys naked options.  You need to buy spreads.  Look up what spreads are.  If you buy a call spread targeting a price of 1400 and TSLA gets there by 6/19, the payoff is like 35-1 instead of 2-1.

POST_TEXT: b"I have a call expiring this Friday 7/24 at a strikeprice of 1610 and an IV of 225%. I know the IV will be crushed since earnings have came and went. With this earnings report being their 4th consecutive green, with new factories announcements, with such a hefty beat of revenue and EPS, and with Tesla being volatile as it is, what should I expect the IV to fall to? Is there any way to guess? Sorry if this question has been done to death, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: I Think I've got a rough guess. Took my sp and looked at next week's call at the same sp. Volatility was 138% that's about a drop of 88%. The Vega was 47, so looks like I'll lose (88x47) -4136$ of intrinsic value, but if Tesla opens at where its sitting now 1657, I'll be 47$ (+4700$) above strike price.. so really I'll be up 500$ from previous day."
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-22 23:23:56'] Pretty sure in the money calls are going to be somewhat green. IV is kinda like expected options move. The implied move was 15% for ER, but it moved some 5%. I’d actually be surprised if you end up red at all tomorrow assuming it opens at 1657. Two days of trading is still a lot for TSLA so the premium remains pretty high. But, having said all that, I just noticed you bought for 11k which is quite expensive. Had you bought right before market close, that would be $$$. I have $1850 purchased 10 minutes before market close and I’m pretty sure I’m fucked to the core. I’ll probably go full retard and buy two of the same contracts tomorrow to try to average down in hopes of a rebound/squeeze.

I've been looking at credit spreads to be able to play without sinking $10,000 in calls.  Given this, spreads seemed to be the easiest option. Why should I open a put credit  spread vs a call debt? How does robinhood hood work with credit spreads?"
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-12 16:25:35'] See now there’s a helpful answer. Also looking at the last 4 months on Tesla, the 9 out of 16 expiration Friday’s stock has made 3% or more moves up or down, mostly up. Buying straight up calls or puts depending on the days price movement at open. Tesla either goes up or down hard  after 10am when the crazy swings are done at open. Not saying it’s not a total spec play but the 1500 calls last week were under 0.3 at one point. I didn’t get into it until they were 10 but still made a nice 300% profit and got out at 40 midday . I’ve done this at least 4 other times with success. Debit spreads are safer plays but left a lot of $ after it blew through the top.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-12 16:03:21'] I would say a put credit spread since you can profit from IV going down and taking advantage when it goes up. You also have defined risk. Depending on your debit OR credit spread, TSLA can be neutral to up/down (depending on the situation).
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-12 16:16:22'] I did a put credit last week, I usually do put credit only for a short term calls since it locks up my colletral, and do call debit if expiry more than a week.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 22:56:06'] Consider selling a put, you’ll get some inflated premium during the IV spike then you can buy it back after the crush for a song. Even if the trade moves against you you’ll probably come out just from theta and IV crush

How can I do that?  \nFor example right now market cap of Rivian is 29B, Tesla 673B. Ratio Tesla/Rivian 23X, my guess in a couple of month it should be a around 15-17. How can I bet on this ratio?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 04:50:34'] Why would you do this?  You can trade only on stock price. You can buy Rivian if you think the price will go up, short the stock of TSLA if you think it will go down.  It has already gone down.  Market capitalization can be affected by bonds being converted to shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 09:06:58'] > I'd like to bet on a specific pair of stocks with no connection on their real value. Who says there is no connection on their value? According to the price history of their shares, there is 0.44 positive correlation. Not super large, to be sure, but not zero either.[Correlation of TSLA vs RIVN.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&symbols=TSLA+RIVN&timePeriod=2&tradingDays=60&months=36)Betting on a **market cap** ratio would be hard. It's easier to bet on price ratios. If you can assume that the public float will stay constant for both, price is a perfect proxy anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 17:25:40'] There's literally 1000 ways to play this. As far as some set strategy there is no way to directly profit from the caps merging. The point is to employ proper strategies to capitalize on this particular movement you think the stocks will make. This can be as simple as buying puts on TSLA if you think it's going down, or selling spreads if you think it is trading flat while RIVN catches up. Then on the other side you should be employing bullish strategies on RIVN as you see fit with market condition. Just because you think this ratio will come to be does not determine how the market will make this ratio happen. You just have to keep a clear mind and recognize better money moves when they are there and protect it when needed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 10:23:19'] You could do a pairs trade maybe? This is where have a long position (real or synthetic) in one stock, and a short in the other. Here's how it could work.Let's assume that ABC and XYZ have a strong correlation such that XYZ is usually $10 less than ABC. And right now, the stocks are only $X apart, where X is some number other than 10. To profit here, you would go long on one symbol and go short on the other. Your expectation is that at some point, *relative to each other*, one will gain value and the other will lose value. It doesn't really matter what their current prices are, or even what their prices will end up being in the future, as long as the stocks *trend towards* that $10 difference.Let's use actual numbers to illustrate:Scenario 1: ABC now is $100. XYZ is now $97. Go long ABC, short XYZ.* Scenario 1-A: ABC later is at 130. XYZ is at 120. Your long stock has gained $30. The short stock has lost $23. Total profit is $7.* Scenario 1-B: ABC is later at $80. XYZ is at $70. Long stock in ABC has lost you $20. Short stock in XYZ has gained you $27. Net gain is (again) $7.Scenario 2: ABC is currently at $100, XYZ is at $85. Now go long XYZ and short ABC.* Scenario 2-A: ABC laters goes to $120, XYZ to $110. ABC has lost you $20 and XYZ has gained $25. Net gain is $5.* Scenario 2-B: ABC later goes to $50, XYZ to $40. ABC has gained you $50, XYZ has lost you $45. Net gain is $5.The upside here is that this doesn't rely on a bear market or a bull market. Up, down, doesn't matter. All you care about is that correlation to correct the prices relative to each other.This gets a bit harder to apply when the relationship isn't a fixed dollar amount, but a ratio instead. You would need to change the amount of shares/contracts in one position or the other.tl;dr if you believe in the correlation and the correlation is currently out of alignment, short one side and long the other to profit off of the correction of that correlation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 10:29:55'] It’s called pairs trading. Obvious they are similar categories of stock, but make sure there is a significant correlation to each other, look at there beta, and historical comparison.At that point it’s relatively simple. It just a matter of how much equity you put in. 1:1 equity would be trading the relation the most, 2:1 would be more hedging ($1000:$1000, $2000:$1000).People who trade pairs mostly use futures because the capital efficient buying power compared to the leverage per dollar

You sold 1000 contracts at  what ever price your vertical spread was at. They are laying that money out on margin . What if you closed the spread the wrong way , closed your long position first incorrectly, leaving you naked on a short leg position. Tesla tanks - do you have 750 a share  x 100,000 shares? 7.5 million ?No if you did you wouldn’t get that letter - they would have frozen your account till the trade settles - three business days . You had a weekend in between hence it took five days - what if you lost . A vertical spread at Schwab is not automatic. It has to be closed manually by you. Here is where you are at, you must call as a day trade restriction was filed against you . You get one warning , but you must call. You will now be told to up the amount in your margin account or they will restrict your trade to only what is in there 25,000 minimum. If you don’t have that you can no longer trade - you said you just made 5x that so no problem . If you happen to get Mr - Ms Hardass on the phone , they can strip you of any margin trades , revoke your level two trading status , drop you to a level one cash only account . Watch how you speak to then . They are the money police - ask for a derivatives broker , they will transfer you to the bad boy department.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 18:32:39'] Curious to hear what the problem was. Can you please share here or through a message. Would love to learn from this experience that you just had. Thank you and Good luck! Hope you get this sorted soon..
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 20:00:37'] Yeah you got a day trade call, HUGE difference.  You can’t close the short side of the spread trade the same day unless you have enough intraday buying power to cover the full value of the short contracts...if you held until the next day you would have been fine.  Now you’re prolly gonna not be able to trade anymore with that broker but you need to call them and ask where you stand it could be worse I’m not sure.  This is risky shit you need to exercise extreme caution going forward...you can’t day trade the short side of any spread unless you can cover the full value in tight intraday “fast” margin...if you hold overnight and close the next day you don’t have to adhere to daytrade margin.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 19:35:15'] Missing a bit of information here.. Why would a margin call mean you're violating day trading rules? Why would you be worried about day trading rules when you have more than enough money?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 19:47:33'] Merrill does this too, they don't consider the spread value for margin, they just consider the one (short) side. I got a 90 day restriction with them because of a spread on SHOP. It was a $500 spread, but like $200k on margin. TDA doesn't do this.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 20:14:25'] call em up, probably just a bug. Sounds like you closed the spreads before expiration so you should be fine.In general, 0 DTE on SPX are safe because they are cash settled, but 0 DTE on TSLA or AMZN you are taking some big assignment risk if you are unable to close them out before expiration. Personally I always take profit on my call spreads by 95% profit a day or two before expiration. Dealing with the stress of expiration day with oversized position is def not worth making an extra 1-2% profit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 04:41:56'] Well, 1,000 contracts x 100 shares x share price (approx $1,000) = $100,000,000. I don’t know what vertical spread you made and I don’t know the size of your account but $7.4M is easy within the intraday volatility of this position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 05:30:26'] thats crazy cuz same thing happened to me last week i sold 10,000 contracts and bankd $267963235
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 05:38:08'] When you initiate a vertical spread you have to have enough money in your account to handle a market move against your position. So, in your case, you were credited $143 per spread, possibly a put spread fairly far out of the money. I was just looking at doing a similar spread yesterday but was waiting for a pullback (put spread). My brokerage will not let me open a spread position unless I have sufficient money in my account to cover the worst possible outcome. I am surprised Schwab let you place the trade in the first place unless your account had millions of free cash in it. I have gotten margin calls after the fact on some trades depending on what else happened in my account. Since you are trading with a lot of money you should know this in the first place.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-02 12:50:02'] Are you on portfolio margin or t-margin?If you're on t-margin. I have no idea, max loss is sustained by the cash in your account.However, if you're on portfolio margin, you likely getting tested and their risk/compliance desk marked it as too risky, i.e. it would blow up your account and they'd have to pick up the tab on the excess loss beyond that.Therefore they would have deemed it necessary to margin call you before that risk could materialize. Trading with leverage comes with much more margin call scrutiny.Did they close out the trade? Give them a call and ask for specifics.Curious on what they tell you... OP where is the response on what the brokerage said? Give us the juicy details.Edit: Typo and added details

I bought some Tesla calls on Friday Aug 28 that expire Sep 4 on Robinhood and for some reason they disappeared and the money was also subtracted from my account. I also received an email because I bought options which I will add a screenshot of. \n\nAre they adjusting something or I actually lost money because I bought in the options late? Again buy date was Aug 28, expiration is Sep 4. Thanks in advance for the response."

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 16:49:14'] You're not fucked.  Lol.  Everyone here is chicken little.First off, if you loose some money call it your cost of education.  Learning something usually costs something.  I'll think you'll get off cheap here.Second, you're short 1 contract.  How much did you sell that for?  $100?  $200?  If you get assigned you'll be short 100 shares with a $900 cost basis.  If TSLA opens on monday at $905 and you buy to close then you'll be at a loss of $5 \* 100 shares = $500 less your premium so lost only $300 to $400.If Tesla opens at $895 then you made $500 plus your premium kept.Head over to r/thetagang and TastyTrade's youtube channel.  If you're going short on options, especially naked, you need to learn to calculate risk/reward to ensure you make money long term and also some basic do's/don't such as 'always BTC before expiry'.  Also download Think or Swim and setup a paper trading account to practice.  You can do it on the weekend using the replay feature.This is not an account ending lesson learned the hard way.  It could have been much worse yes, but it's really just a bump in the road.  Learn and move on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 16:25:00'] You will most likely be short TSLA shares.* You can buy the stock to cover the position.* You can buy a call to cover the position and cap upside losses if you intend to hold the short for longer.* You can also sell covered puts against the short position.Given you are asking this sub what to do then just close the position by buying the stock.Edit: spelling.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 18:23:27'] Dont ever hold positions to expiration. Ever. Especially tesla. Any day of the week, Musk could end up in jail, overdosed, masturbating live on twitter or talking about how he wants to put a soup can in his rectum and the stock will tank. That could happen anytime, but that precious span between market close and the exercise deadline are especially dangerous. Here's why:https://youtu.be/rtVFj9nRRDo
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 16:05:16'] It actually closed at 900.09, but that's enough for you to get assigned.If you have access to the after hours market, you could buy 100 shares of TSLA right now at about 902.63.  These shares would cancel out the sale resulting from your assignment and you'd limit your loss to about $263.If not, you'll have to wait until Monday morning and hope TSLA doesn't open much higher.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 16:16:24'] If you get assigned (and you probably will be), you’ll be short 100 shares. If you don’t have enough margin for that, your broker will probably close that position at the open on Monday, at whatever the market price is.The broker probably won’t close it in pre-market trading, but you might be able to.Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 16:18:32'] You won't get wrecked. You'll see a loss but everything will work out
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 17:51:05'] I’d call your broker Monday premarket to go over your options, as others said you’re likely going to incur a loss but not financial ruin type unless it gaps up. You also may profit if it drops but either way monitor Monday premarket and call your broker
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-12 18:22:25'] We all have to learn. This is a get rich quick that failed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 08:04:27'] You should have received your assignment notification by now, if you indeed were going to get assigned. Did you?Since it was a call, you will *receive* $90k in cash and be short 100 shares. So you will be praying for TSLA to open Monday below 900. The higher it goes, the more trouble you will be in. But even so, keep in mind you got that $90k cash, so even if it goes to say $905, you're net loss in covering will only be $500, plus borrowing and transaction fees.If you want to put a cap on your Market open exposure, open a GTC limit order to cover the short shares now, and pick a limit that is above 900. Like 905 or however much you are willing to lose automatically. That won't save you from a big gap up on open, but it will make sure you are filled for the best possible price if it opens below your limit. So if TSLA opens at 899 and immediately ticks up to 907 and stays above that the rest of the day, you have a shot at covering for a profit, as opposed to trying to do it manually and missing the market.If it gaps up huge, you might get margin called. That's the worst-case scenario. The more cash (above and beyond the 90k) and equity you have in the account, the lower your risk of a margin call.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 08:08:23'] It is 100% coming right back down, all this up and down volatility is the big boys unloading their bags. I see this around $750 right at split
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-13 16:53:25'] OK here is the lowdown - you’re kind of fucked but it will work out First thing that should have happened is your position disappeared Friday - sold off . It’s been assigned - it hasn’t settled yet as options take 24,hours to settle . Your account is going to light up - 90,009.00 only for a day . You will get a call, you should - you borrowed 90,000 worth of a Tesla - do you have 90,000? Next they know you don’t have it , they see your account . They will sell it to defend their position . Now Monday if TSLA drops 50.00 you owe 5000 they will sell it for 850. You will get a FINRA warning letter , you traded stock without the money and left the position open . You are supposed to have the money in the account - at their discretion they could shut your account down. You did a really stupid thing . Next time if you are dumb enough to do this , take a long call slightly out of the money to hedge in case it moves up. OK schools out

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:39:10'] Why do I get the feeling the second this person buys a put the market will rally 5% in a single day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 10:15:17'] If you are new to options, don't just buy a put option - buy a spread. If you buy a single put option with 815 strike, that option will cost you $59.90 right now so your break even is that you need Tesla under $755 to make money. If you buy a single option, you want to be directionally certain of the direction of the move. Instead - do a spread to lower your risk. Buy the 815 strike Put (costs $60) // Sell the 750 strike (pays $34.50) for $25.55 net debit and max profit of $49.45 per contract if Tesla drops to $750 or lower. Of course, if you REALLY know that Tesla is going to drop, then go right ahead and buy the single Put option at full price and ignore the spread. But if really knew that Tesla was going one direction or another you would not be new to options and you be minted already. So take the safer bet - the put spread. Way cheaper if you are wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 09:16:13'] If you have enough money to buy tesla puts, you can also get QQQ puts, Nasdaq, for a fraction of the price. Seems to me a safer option.September QQQ puts at 300 strike seems like a good idea to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:01:37'] OP had better get the timing right. Sometimes TSLA rips $100 for no reason.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:09:59'] Tesla is extremely volatile and can gain or lose $100 in a day. Often seen it swing 50 one way then 50 the other ie drop 50 then recover or spike $50 and lose it. Tesla puts are the worst kind of gambling
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 09:47:14'] I'm a TSLA bull so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've been selling puts to people like you for over 2 years now and I've made over 300k on them. The market may be going bearish but I wouldn't still bet long term against TSLA at the moment. Just do QQQ or SPY puts

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:51:33'] The whole tech market is selling off on a massive downtrend forming on many indicators, if someone here is dissuading you from buying puts, they are not good at this. TSLA is a good choice (there are extrinsic factors supporting ifs over-valuation as well), go a bit further  OTM and further out on the date, more than a month out. The premiums and TSLA’s big movements will net you good gains on a smaller buy, you’ll basically just have to wait for a slight bounce up so you don’t overpay or get IV crush, which will probably happen this week. Also read about Delta and Theta if you haven’t already. That’s my advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 17:47:23'] If that's what you really want, go for it. Recommendations: 1 contract only. You may be in for an unpleasant lesson (see next point). Assume you'll lose 100% of your bet. This is not an exaggeration. Others have said this, TSLA is one of the most volatile stocks out there. If it plays against you (easily 80 points against you) kiss your money good-bye. Time to expiration won't even save you. Your contract will be basically worthless cuz will be so OTM.Low ball your offer for the contract. If it doesn't fill after 5 mins modify your price and try again. You may be right in the play but a poor execution may screw you. i.e. you paid too much for the contract where you could have bought it for a couple hundred less. Don't pay ANY price for the contract.

I love a good short, but that stock defies gravity … often!  My brother sent me an article last year raving about how many millions people had made shorting TSLA..  My reply: “Interesting that they’re not talking about how many millions people have lost TRYING to short TSLA.”  I’ve been smoked 3 times trying.  Apparently I’m not such a quick study.  My advice is that this a time to be patient and let the market reveal its hand.  Take it FWIW

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 14:42:02'] Please, for the love of God, don't invest in options until you fully understand how they trade and the risk associated. Leverage investing is very risky and in a volatile market like this, it's a recipe for disaster for a beginner. Also, stay away from extra volatile stocks like TSLA, SHOP and so on. People lost many brokerage accounts when they started to play with margin.

Also read the book A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis by Anna Coulling.When training in the paper account, only buy a put at the break of a downtrend and get out immediately after it hits 10% or 20%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 21:58:00'] Here's the problem selling puts on TSLA.  You really have to like the price you set.  Because if TSLA dumps 100 points below that price...you are going to have to wait, and potentially for a long time, to recoup that money.  "Oh I'll sell calls against my position."So frickin' lame and theta like.Say you sell a 750....get assigned at 750 when it gets to 650.now you sell a 30 DTE 775 call for like 5.  Not that much.During that time TSLA, moves up to 840.  You "try" to roll your position out, but you can't unless you go out 60 days.  You don't want to roll to an 850 Call 60 days out.  Because you fear that TSLA might go back to 1000.So you end up getting assigned at 775, you bought at 750, you make a small profit...and TSLA just blows away and you miss out on so much gains.This shit happens all the time.

POST: ['2022-08-07 20:40:13'] POST TITLE: b'managing a put debit spread that went deep in the money'
POST_TEXT: b"I have Tesla 940-900 put debit spread with December expiry. With current price at 860, I'm wondering if there is a low risk way to make sure this trade can only close in profit? Or higher profit at similar risk. Right now my spread is 20% up"
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 20:57:11'] You could roll it down. This is, close it, bank what you originally paid for it, and buy a new debit spread with the remainder.Another possibility would be to sell a put credit spread for the amount of your original trade. Again, banking your original cost and letting the rest ride.There are several variations of this, depending on how bullish or bearish you are.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 02:08:35'] Because it's a long dated spread, theta isn't your friend yet.  Also, only 20% gain isn't a lot to work with. Anything that you do at this point isn't likely to lock in a no loss trade because risk and reward go hand in hand.    You could roll the spread down, booking some gain but that's going to lower your net delta.    You could roll your long leg down a few strikes but that reduces net delta and reduces potential profit.    You could sell an OTM put spread. That lowers your current cash at risk but adds downside loss if TSLA tanks.  IOW, you'll increase your gain until the short put spread goes ITM, at which point, the more TSLA drops, the more gains you'll give back.    You could buy a mildly OTM call spread so that if TSL reverses, to some extent, your call spread gains what your long put spread loses.    In all cases, you have to run the numbers on each possible adjustment to see how much they affect P&L.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 05:52:37'] What others have said...plus, "don't fall in love with a trade".In the future, you probably want to prepare for such an eventuality ("have a trade plan") so that you don't have to ask others.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 03:07:09'] 20% up on a debit is not much to work with.  The only low risk way is to close it.TSLA could be + or - $300 by December which is why the spread won’t change much in value after a $50 move in the price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 05:25:50'] Selling for a gain now makes for a permanent gain.  TSLA may bounce up again, and you lose the gain you have.  You can follow up with another trade if you so desire.  You could sell a call credit spread, risking TSLA does not go up.  You could sell a put credit spread, well below the present stock price, making a long put condor.  Risk that TSLA goes through the lower put credit spread.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 23:41:45'] This is tough because obviously you have about 80% left to collect if TSla stays below 900. And being a jumpy stock, you just can’t tell. It looks like it will visit 800 before 900, but the news on the energy bill could change all that tomorrow. Maybe sell short term otm credit spreads below 800?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 04:26:20'] Sell a call credit spread for 900-940
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-08 11:02:18'] You have 20% gain , you’re nervous , chances are after the imminent split it will take off . You do not want to hold a put option during a split you can get killed in sentiment and market perception - Biden’s EV tax credit bill which passed today is headwinds galore for your trade - take the guys advice above don’t fall in love with a trade or a hooker she’ll only break your heart .

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 08:53:15'] Elon's ability to keep the hype train rolling is 2nd to none.  Take a look at what happened when Dr. Burry, the king of brass balls and short positions, announced his short position in $TSLA.  Dr. Burry lays out a very reasonable and encouraging message to Elon to issue shares and take profits to cement Tesla's existence.  He even used an email from Elon where he himself admits that the stock price is not based in real value.  In response Elon essentially jingled some keys by announcing a massive Bitcoin position.  I'm guessing he has dozens of such distractions ready to go since the entire existing electricity model can be improved by leaps and bounds.  Not to mention you can electrify new things like boats, ships, bikes, boards, flight, etc. Each of these would serve as fuel for the hype train.  Also there was the flame thrower...TLDR:  It's Dr. Burry's brass balls VS Elon's long shlong.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:35:28'] I shorted Tesla too.  The more I do my due diligence, I realize that Tesla is a great company, but that doesn't make it a great stock.  As an analogy, Cisco is a great company, but if you bought the stock in 1999-2000, you'd still be looking at 40% losses 20 years later, even though they control the enterprise networking space, and are the largest player in the SMB networking space.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:41:36'] I was in this camp prior to this year. I didn’t short Tesla but I never bought any. Increasing competition was my rationale as well but my tune has changed recently. China is the largest market and most worrisome for Tesla because I think NIO is showing promise. However, it takes a while to scale and technology is key to this industry. In the US there is no equal competition. BMW, Porsche, Audi future cars are all priced above $50k and some are north of $100k. Tesla dropping their prices make them more affordable for the masses. What also needs to be considered is the technology inside a Tesla as well as Elon’s future projects and how they will integrate with cars. Tesla will likely win the autonomous battle and first to market always wins.

If you see a new player in the robotaxi/automated driving/energy space I could see it majorly affecting TESLA's share price, but in the areas that tesla really shines, they dont have much competition.Billions were lost by TESLA shorts for making the mistake of seeing TESLA's value as a car company instead of a technology company.

So, the earnings miss showed investors signs of weakness ahead for the company — and helped kick off the pullback we’ve seen in the stock.But I’ve tracked the stock since 2006. And I knew these past few weeks would be volatile.Now that the stock has dipped 14% from its peak, it’s time for us to jump in and buy call options.Tesla’s stock has dropped on earnings seven times since 2006. On each occasion, the stock has bounced back. That’s a 100% win rate.We’ll take advantage of the expected rebound by adding the April 16, 2021 $790 call option"

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:58:54'] Here's the thing (hear me out) -- Tesla is not a car company. Yes, it is ostensibly a car company, but it's value is in its *BRAND*. If not for that, it's a clear and obvious short. But soon it will be more than a car company. IMHO, before long it will be the next Apple--  Heat pumps for the auto industry and homes, thermostats, car chargers, solar panels, "smart" home tech, "smart" car tech... All Tesla branded. Disclosure: I have no positions at all in TSLA. Zero. I sold all my stock months ago and have been trying to figure out what everyone else sees but I didn't. This is the absolute best case I can come up with.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 09:35:01'] First of all, Tesla isn't an automobile company, it's an electronic company that sells battery packs , solar panels and also carsAlso people don't view Tesla stock as a 1:1 ratio compared to the company value or profit, people view tesla way more weighted towards future gains since Tesla reinvest alot of its profits towards future growthAlot of people have bet against Elon and thus far unsuccessfully.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:39:33'] I'm not saying Tesla's valuation is realistic whatsoever, but I don't think competition is such a bad thing like Tesla bears seem to always think.There's a reason Elon has always made Tesla patents public, he's always wanted more competition and market attention in the EV space. Tesla has (and imo always will be) the upper-class, luxury EV with advanced tech. I don't think competition from vehicles like the Nissan Leaf or even the Audi e-Tron (which is totally sick) will undercut Tesla's market share. Essentially, the Venn diagram of Tesla consumers and Chevy Bolt consumers is 2 circles. More people buying EVs will always mean more Tesla owners (and more EV subsidies), no matter how you spin it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:39:08'] You’re not betting against Elon you’re betting against an unjustifiable valuation. What I think the Tesla cultists are missing here is that most people shorting Tesla don’t think it’s a bad company or don’t believe in Elon, it’s just at an unsustainable and stupid price for the company. Even Elon has said this, wake up people!I would implore all of you to look at what happened to Microsoft and Amazon during the dotcom bubble. Tesla stock has been on a run for just a year now stop acting like it’s price is a law of nature. A lot of you haven’t done your stock market history homework and are new to this, it shows.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:47:52'] Lmao good luck. I’ve gotten lucky on put debit spreads a couple times on TSLA, but only if I hold for very short terms. Also selling call credit spreads is not shorting the stock. Thinking that that is shorting the stock makes me believe you may be new to this and think that TSLA stock will follow some sort of logic, which it doesn’t. Cathie Wood and ARKK just significantly increased their TSLA position and I bet they know more than you. Many very smart, very experienced traders have been wrecked trying to bet against TSLA based on logical reasons.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:50:26'] Godspeed man. Let us know how it comes out. The E-tron does look amazing but the range estimates is sort of bleak. Porsche is doing a decent one too. I personally can’t wait until Mazda and Subaru jump on board. An electric Mazdaspeed3 or an electric WRX? I’m in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:50:49'] I'm not very knowledgeable about the stock market and I've only been dipping my toes in for a year, but it seems like there's a shift in strategy. Fundamentals still matter but a lot of stocks are propped up on looking forward to potential not just what's going on now. All last year we heard the same thing about tesla. It's a bubble and it will pop. I'm sure it'll have a slight pop, but do you really think it'll come crashing down? I'm of the opinion that investing in tesla is about tesla AND about investing in Elon. And that guy can't be stopped. I don't have any tesla shares just my meager opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:12:49'] The main reason I would never short Tesla right now is for the taxi side. Cathie wood has talked about this and is why she is still so bullish on her price target. Basically nobody has priced in the ability for Tesla to be the worlds future of autonomous taxi services, and right now they are in the driver seat to be the main vendor.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:13:08'] Increasing competition? Huh? What changed in the last 5 years? VW selling some cars to their own dealers. Ford wants to only sell EVs in Europe. In 2030 🙃

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:42:00'] I own GM stock. I was comparing their market cap and vehicle production to that of Tesla’s. I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me, but GM roughly produces 10 times more vehicles then Tesla, yet its market cap is roughly 1/10th of Tesla’s.  So if you put that in perspective of vehicles produced, Tesla’s market cap per vehicle produced is 100 times higher than GM. Crazy. I certainly do think that Tesla should be valued higher than GM. But by 100 times? I don’t think so. So I’m bullish on GM, as they pivot heavier towards EV, and bearish on Tesla.

Sold 10 for 1600 and the remaining 10 are worth a little under 2k, I think people will buy this dip and I'm hoping to sell around March or push it a little farther out to avoid short term gains.  200 shares at 12.50 as well, so I currently like Ford.  Kind of need to see what their EV lineup is going to look like, but I'd bet it will be well received both by current Ford owners and also by those driving something else but looking for a new vehicle and thinking about switching to EV.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-19 14:12:47'] Honestly, not right now.  The monthly chart is jammed right up against the 4th standard deviation bands and with resistance from ~1998-2000 above.  Support is around $17-18 and it just did a huge bearish engulfing on the daily after running a marathon for almost 3 months from September until now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 13:24:22'] My answer as a full-time wheel trader is the same each time this is asked over and over every week . . .You need to be good with holding whatever stocks you trade for a time if needed, maybe even months.  If you are good with this, then these are the stocks to trade.Those with higher premiums are usually crap stocks that will drop and cause losses.Also, you will find the profits are as good with lower risks by opening trades 30-45 dte instead of weekly.  Good luck . . .
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 15:42:14'] It’s not a stock, but you could try SPY
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 19:00:45'] I’m doing the wheel on SPY and QQQ. Obviously big capital outlays but far easier to manage than worrying about an individual company and industry dynamics all the time. So far averaging about 8% annualized return so far.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:30:46'] All of I seen is people collecting premuim for a month or two then the market drops and they spend a year trying to get back to even.  Then they give up and sell the shares at a loss.  Don’t seem like a consistent strategy to me
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 09:47:48'] I turned 8k into 32k in 2.5 months mostly on Revlon. I wouldn't suggest that though because it's nonsense. I am just getting lucky like crazy. The top comment is right, but I am trying to build a bit faster, so I pick more volatile stocks that give 10 to 14% premium a week. I usually shoot for 6% premium a week, but honestly, if you pick an absolutely boring stock like the company I work for, Berry Global (BERY), they have been $50 plus or minus $20 for 5 years straight. They are professional at going absolutely sideways. And we aren't going out of business any time soon unless we for real run out of food. If you wheel berry you will make easy 3-4% a month. That's slow AF for me as I try for 6% a week minimum. But there ain't no bank in the world giving you 3% a month. Probably not even 3%. Year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 15:51:22'] I just started trading options. I’d run Goog, AMZN, and AMD to name a few. Maybe even Microsoft or Apple if the premiums are decent enough. Be sure you’re ok with holding the stocks you do this strategy with. Like many others have stated… you might be stuck with them for awhile selling the covered calls. I also try and get a decent return on my investment. It also depends on how many days to expiration you are looking at. 45 day… 30 or weekly. Just depends on whether you’re comfortable having collateral tied up for x dte or not.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 21:33:35'] Try SPY?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-01 22:07:21'] I would highly recommend you do the wheel strategy on undervalued companies.  I like HZO or THO and they are at their buy prices right now.  Good luck as this strategy will push your tollerance levels and your conviction of owning those companies.  I learned my lesson by doing the wheel on MEME or hype stocks like RIOT, which was very volatile.. big mistake, now i'm stuck holding the bag on that one but for a few months it made me some good cash flow.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 21:57:51'] Take a break if you start to get emotional with trading. Occasionally, for a few weeks, and occasionally, for a few months. It is quite helpful. Trading isn't worth the anguish and frustration... If you're not in the appropriate frame of mind, you'll keep making poor choices out of desperation until your account is entirely blown.     Tell you what, you can try using a trading bot assuming you have a lot of experience this time around. For this, I recommend [Breaking Equity](https://www.breakingequity.com/?r=1).

Additionally if you’re doing straight up calls, start thinking about LEAPS and PMCC (Poor Man’s covered calls).   If the stock takes off buy back the short position and ride the wave.  Additionally when you get back on, go for base hits and not home runs.   Look at trends.   (Monthly trends, seasonal trends,  triple witching, earnings , controversy, new product announcements or basically “ why am I in this option or stock position).  Hope you get back on the saddle.

What a huge mistake, because about 24 hours later, the damn thing not only recovered completely, but went up by 40% to 60%.Instead of losing $1,500 cuz of damn emotions, I would have gained like $2,000 and celebrated with those same stupid ass emotions.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 22:34:01'] I’m a ticker watcher, especially if I don’t have anything else to do or work is slow, so I don’t have tips for that. But I have a couple others that help me. Use a different app than your broker app to check the market. This way if something is down big, you can’t just start trading because you aren’t in the broker app - it’ll gives you a moment to think before you react and check the news too. This helps me decide if the reason I bought is still intact or not and then I decide accordingly.The second thing I do is set a price target for the position and add a notification on my tracker app, once again, not my broker. As I mentioned it helps me from opening my broker and trading. If my PT gets hit I re-evaluate and then decide if I feel like riding it out some more and set a new price target and keep holding or selling. I mostly sell because I’m conservative on my short term trades as I just use it to help grow my long stock at this point in life. I do this for anything 3+ months options and short term shares. I just do earnings checkups on my long holds. Using a separate app in general has me in the habit of opening the tracker app instead of my broker, so way less trading and more watching for opportunity.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 23:56:04'] Congrats to you for realizing this. In terms of advice: 1. there is the concept of intrinsic value. Trying to understand what a company is really worth and understanding that in 99% of cases that is above or below the current price. That has not so much to do with options, but is at the core of value investing. For me, the price movements doesn’t make me very emotional, as I am more focused on intrinsic value. 2. Think in bets and not outcome. Maybe your decision to sell Tesla was the right decision. You never know about the future, you can just make a decision based on known facts. You have two aces on your hand and go all in: maybe not the wrong decision. You have nothing and go all in but somehow still win unexpectedly: well, good outcome for you but it was not a good play. So think in bets. Learn from poker and understand that outcome and good decisions are not always the same.

Instead of panic sell, i just let go and treated as if it doesnt exist and just left it untouched and moved onto other stocks as i knew the company would spring back sometime later. Took longer than expected but did work out. As for emotional trading, i do believe it helps abit as most ppl think thee similar - if you have strong urge to buy, hold or sell as so many others would do the same. BUT always do some DD before investing unless you are just tossing fee cents here and there just to have some fun like playing slots.

There’s no shortcut to this lesson, and it’s the single most important and PRODUCTIVE lesson you can learn- congratulations! You’ve experienced what it’s like to trade your feelings  and you will be that much more equipped to be able to ignore them when you open your next positions. As you state, having defined exit plans, or any plans at all, is a huge step toward ensuring that happens. Stock prices never do what you “want” them to do, but will frequently do what you “think” they’ll do. My advice is 1), regularly reassess if your opinion about what the price will do has changed. If so, adjust accordingly. If not, do nothing (always an overlooked option), and if you’re not sure, do nothing until you are. Dont let your feelings tell you that you must always do something. 2) Keep track of how often you’re right and wrong so you can make sure the gains you take are large enough to offset the losses. You should be able to know what those ratios are, so if you don’t, start keeping track. Don’t stop trading! You’ve just learned what will help you make big gains in the years to come!
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 02:47:16'] My two cents and where I believe your mistake was, is that you didn plan a strategy before entering the trade. Planning is fundamental to success. If you plan your trading from start to finish you are prepared for negative outcomes also. It is not a sudden event and gives you experience also to make better trades in the future. Don't focus of how the trade evolved but focus on entry and exit planning according to your risk tolerance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 02:53:24'] The best changes I've made to my strategy after destroying my portfolio are as follows:  **1) There is no such thing as a missed opportunity.**  Yes, black swan events are rare.    However, there are so many cases of stocks going up or down by 100s of % in a day or 1000s in a year.  Chasing a stock is a fool's game and very VERY rarely pays off.  Don't try to force an entry or exit point onto a stock you're (emotionally) invested in.  If you have a strategy (swing trading etc) then look for opportunities that fit your criteria and don't try to convince yourself that there's an opportunity there otherwise.**2) There are only three things that matter when assessing stocks** ***(and they all affect each other.)***  Technical Analysis attempts to measure sentiment, what the market believes is fair value based on buying and selling pressures at different levels of valuation.  TA typically remains correct until something changes.Fundamental Analysis looks at actual data, news, numbers.  If TA is the driver then FA is the cop with a speed camera who will chase you down if you're out of line.  Sometimes TA runs away from FA but that's never done without the help of the last one.Sentiment Analysis, which takes things like social media posts and attempts to gauge the wider public opinion about a stock.  This one is fickle, full of liars and trolls.  However, it can be helpful to guide your analysis towards FA or TA if you're unsure.  **3) Leave your ego at the door.**This one might be the most relevant for you.  If you have too much ego/confidence you won't second-guess your DD when it's wrong.  If you have too little confidence you won't stop doubting your DD when it's correct.Be Confident about your DD but avoid confirmation bias, avoid FOMO, avoid unfounded FUD.Be Objective.  Take the information into consideration in a dispassionate way and use your chosen analyses to figure out if it's helpful to your end goal.Finally, sometimes results will have nothing to do with your DD.  A company gets bought up at a good price and you pat yourself on the back, even though it was nothing but luck.  That's your ego convincing you that you somehow earned those gains. You didn't really.Sometimes you had everything right and some news comes out that tanks the stock.  It sucks, but that's not on you.&#x200B;Hope this helps.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 03:46:21'] First decide if it's your system or emotions that caused the problem.  Often the two are confused because we select or create trading systems based on our emotions... how much we want risk on a trade, how we evaluate risk, how we manage our capital, how we determine if a   a particular system is appropriate for a particular market. Emotions can enter the creation of a system that will fail even if no emotions is involved in executing the system.  Review your notes - you have them, right? - to see why you entered and why you exited.  Take a break. Don't resume trading until you clearly and unemotionally understand what happened.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 04:29:18'] I use to be an emotional trader before and the way i learnt was to literally force myself away from my screen and think logically. Is it better to sell now? Is a catalyst coming up? Why did i buy the stock in the first place? If i hold for 1 more month, is the price likely to go back up? All these questions i ask myself first away from my screen and think, it takes 1 second to close the app and just walk away for a bit. IF im gonna sell right now, what difference would it make if i sell in 10 minutes from now? Thats what i keep in my head and then it keeps me thinking logically
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 04:29:44'] Trading is 40% strategy and size at most. The rest of it is psychological. Psychology by far is the biggest hurdle most traders have to overcome, and unfortunately, because it's human behavior, there is no set guideline to follow.You're honest enough to admit that you didn't plan ahead and didn't have an exit strategy. That's where you should start: have a plan going into every trade with a strategy to get out in case the trade both goes and doesn't go your way. Educate yourself on when to enter and when to exit if you haven't done that already.Other than that, spend time in the market. I was an emotional trader too for months, but time in the market and continuing to study charts helped tone down the emotions more. It's still a work in progress, but I'm processing information much more logically now than two or three months ago. While you're doing this, trade with small size; the second you feel the need to go big, stop and walk away.Always remember the old cliche: unsuccessful traders chase gains, successful traders manage risk.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 04:37:05'] It took me years to come back to options after a 50% loss on my account. I finally returned with a lot of respect for how options work. I firmly believe that options are far safer than shares if you know how to treat them.

You're a living proof of it you lost money in a massive bull run Take your time to make your picks and stick to them. My buy and hold strategy has an average return of about 35%/y and I can spend a whole week without checking my positions if I'm busy.Analyse yourself and your portfolio and understand what you have and who you are.Be BRUTALLY honest with yourself.Are you a classically trained stock market analyst or a professional in the business? Or maybe you're just some guy who watched youtube videos and now believes he can beat the market?What's Tesla? Is it a logical investment from a theorical standpoint? Do you want to buy it because you believe it is fundamentally worth it's current price or because you believe people will be willing to pay more for it later anyway?Finally, ETFs are alot of money for little troubles.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 05:21:53'] When you cut at loss, dont cut at loss when you feel the worst part of scary feeling but wait until you feel like maybe i can exit out even.When you make profits dont wait until you hit bagger but cut at 20-30% profits. Sure it could have been a bagger or even two (bagger meaning by 100% profits) but the point should be that you have to have your own strategy. Also if you think it's too much dont play option like tsla or shop start one with small cap like pltr fubo and etc.This will help to set your principle and when you feel confident on your principle you can manage it betterAt the end of days even if you lose fubo's earning yolo option play it's just meager 100$, but just imagine for amzn tsla mrna or shop.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 05:29:19'] Brother only invest into company or stocks you have high convictions for. Companies you've done research on. Distinguish which ones are Long term(over a year minimum) and what's short term (a few months). When you do this, you'll be more emotionally detached. Tesla is a long term hold as an example in my opinion.

A lot of people held on to their TSLA shares the entire year (including me) because they believe in the long term abilities of Tesla to keep dominating the car industry. Since you are just gambling, you might as well spend the time to learn technical analysis. There are thousands of videos on youtube to watch for TA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 08:26:59'] I think being hit helps. You know it hurts and so afraid to do it next time. I just decreased my leverage, reviewed my strategies and now I sleep like a baby.Also, you know now, that waiting can help. Don't trade after sharp moves. There often will be at least some rebound. Sometimes a good company makes a dumb move and is screwed till next earnings. It is a waiting game, among other. The market is counterintuitive thing. I do the opposite of what my gut tells me to buy low and sell high.Also, maybe you just need to read some literature? Learn about [Kelly Criterion](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/mn0ykx/kellys_criterion_for_gamblers/). It describes, how you are likely to lose, even when the chances are for you, just because of sizing. Don't be overleveraged, it is bad for your mental health and money. It is very important. Learn about the damn risk management! I size my bets, so my max loss on each is not that big. I have some naked puts against margin, but I'll easily stomach even a circuit breakers day.I think you should put it all aside to calm down and go read some books on this.And the literature says, that you probably won't beat the market, see the arguments for the efficient market hypothesis. I actually treat trading like fun and not money making. And what I do is often just a kind of leverage, I'm fine to have a bit and it is successful in the backtests.Stop loss is not a tool for me. Bad for options, cause volatility and not traded outside hours. Bad, cause not the best price. Bad, cause you cannot wait a bit after a spike. My stop losses would be at like -40% of the stock value, so I just don't bother. Maybe they are very useful for day traders or something.Or maybe you just screw it and go become a [boglehead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/)? It is not a bad decision, not at all. Just as I won't ever recommend trading, I always recommend passive investing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 09:32:01'] I wrote a program that defines entry and exit points for trades for me after a load of testing. Now I just do whatever it tells me to do, then sit back and watch the stock prices jump about all over the place in a way that would normally make me shit bricks. But now I’m like, “Well I could see this happening all the time when I tested this thing and it kept telling me to ignore the static, so I will.”It’s quite liberating watching prices plummet and feeling like, “Well ok that’s just the cycle these things go through, no need to panic.” Then sure enough, days or weeks later it’s right back where the program told me it’d be and I didn’t panic sell.

Second opinion always plan your strategies. are you doing long-term or short-term? Also take taxes into consideration if you don't know how to do options don't go into them I'm pretty sure all this stuff you know already and it's hard to control your emotions but trust me this is the best lesson you've learned nothing teaches you more than lost money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 14:42:00'] I had the same experience, go to paper trading until you have 100% confidence in your strategy. Go back to live trading after like 4-5 months. If you get emotional, use smaller size (shouldn't put more than 3-5% of your account into a position in my not so humble opinion.) Confidence overpowers fear. I haven't gone back to live trading yet, but I've been developing strategies and have been successful so far. I want to wait until I bring my paper account over 25k before I go back to live. I highly suggest paper trading (ToS has great paper trading.)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 15:01:31'] Paul Tudor Jones was known for slowing down when trading results were poor and speeding up when they were good.I try to follow this philosophy so when I'm on a losing streak I just slow down and trade very lightly.Emotional traders often do the opposite: the more they lose, the faster they trade, turning small losses into bigger and bigger ones.Slow down and take it easy when you're losing. Trading is always a choice and you don't need to trade if you're not feeling it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 16:06:29'] I saw someone already say it but take a break. Same thing has happened to me and many others. It doesn’t help seeing people walk away with insane gains in one trade and we are here trying to make a living with a solid risk management. But you gotta know yourself and take a step back. When you get back in use less money to get the feel for it again and where you don’t care to loose it. See it as a game and take away your emotion. But remember this, you got this. This happens to the best of us and it’s definitely not the end. Learn from it and get better.

They have enough cash on hand to last a few years and have good growth prospects? Buy in when it drops another 20% and sit on it. Only size in when it breaks major resistances like triple tops or a Fibonacci retracement. Don’t average down. I guarantee you’ll make way more money this way than if you tried to get green results every day.There’s dozens of stocks a year they go from single to double digits. They consolidate at some arbitrary floor but still have life in them. That go from $1 to $2 to $4 a share in the course of weeks. But it takes months to develop.You have to be the trader that is comfortable holding that stock for months.

Without that, you have no idea if a dip is something you should buy, wait, or sell. Have a time horizon of *at least* a quarter, so you can make reassessments at earnings. Do your own DD.

POST_TEXT: b'Im interested in buying the Tesla $400 strike call option expiring June 16, 2023. I like this option because it will grow much like owning 100 shares without dishing out the 100k capital. I can buy for about 50k give or take. \n\nLets say Tesla is near 2k per share when I want to sell after about 12 months. My option will be even deeper in the money. Whats my worst case to sell this option if liquidity dries up? Ive heard an options contract, as long as its in the money, will always sell for its intrinsic value. So is this calculated in my scenario by subtracting the share price of 2k minus my strike price of 400? So I get 1600 of intrinsic value. Or 160k value to my options contract I purchase for 50k. Is this correct?\n\nSo my concern is obviously liquidity. But could someone confirm what Im saying is correct? And if so, how do I force this sale if liquidity dries up?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 16:55:30'] Your math adds up to be correct to me.> … how do I force this sale if liquidity dries up?You make the market maker an offer he can’t refuse.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 17:25:16'] Deep ITM is always liquid if the stock is liquid, you'll be fine. Do know you are buying into a rising rate environment. There's a great chance you get crushed on this.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 18:32:39'] Depending on your broker, it might also be possible to “exercise and sell to cover.” For example, with a $400 strike, the cost to exercise would be $40,000. If the underlying is $2,000 your broker may essentially front you the $40k, exercise the option, then immediate sell enough shares to cover the $40k — in this case 20 shares — leaving you with 80 shares worth $160k, which you paid $50k to purchase.That’s not a bad return on your investment *if the price prediction pans out*.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 16:54:26'] Just buy the shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 17:47:59'] You're right, deep ITM options will always be able to sell for at least intrinsic value.  So selling it won't be an issue, although personally I would pick the 500 strike which has higher open interest.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 17:56:36'] If I was you I’d either 1) accept that you may have to free up enough money to execute the contract in the future, or 2) just buy shares. I have been burned by low liquidity, ITM LEAPS before… I won’t ever do it again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 23:02:02'] You are correct very deep ITM calls (like 95 delta) have virtually no extrinsic value.  In your case a 400 strike call on a stock with a strike price of 2000, let’s say  2 months before expiration will have a few bucks, maybe 5-10 max, or extrinsic value.  It’s bid price will basically be intrinsic value.  There is no risk with this option.  It’s will 100% be ITM at expiration.  So there will be no premium attached to the bid.  As there is no risk.  It will trade just like owning 100 shares.You will never have to worry about liquidity at this level.  You may need to price it properly and give the MM a few bucks to take it off your hands, like sell it for 1598, but that is not the problem at all here.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 17:23:56'] You can always sell it if the price is right
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 23:53:42'] Liquidity won’t dry up on one contract.  If you were holding 10,000 contracts, ok sure. A case could be made for liquidity.  But if we are talking literally one contract, I don’t think you’re going to run into an issue.Even if you do run into some crazy scenario where there are no buyers, you could do one of two things.One, you could exercise the contract, buy the shares for $400, and immediately sell for $2000, netting a cool $1600 in the process.  To do this, you’d need $40k cash.  Don’t have that much?  No problem. Just sell your contract for a few bucks under value.  That’s to say, if you sold your $400 call option for $1595 when share price is $2k, then some lucky buyer who has $200k cash lying around would instantly make $500 risk free.  You’d of course lose out on that $500 of intrinsic value, but hey, that was the price of you moving the asset.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 09:15:12'] Liquidity will never dry up on contracts that have intrinsic value.==================================================================Sorry for having to shout that, but there is so much knee-jerk "just exercise it" noise in the thread that I had to shout the correct answer.You can always, always find a buyer for a contract with value. You may not like the price they offer, but you can definitely close for the bid.I mean, think about it. If your contract has $1000 of intrinsic value and the bid is $1000, why wouldn't there be a buyer? And, better yet, if you offer $999, who wouldn't want $1 of free money? It will be like waving a magic wand as buyers come from every corner of the market to take your free money from you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 22:40:12'] If you get that deep ITM call, you can write calls against it while you hold... The poor man covered call.  With a juicy stock like Tesla, you could pull a nice piece of coin every couple weeks or better depending on stock movements.  At the very least you can cut down your original cost basis considerably.It's a strategy worth looking into.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 01:36:34'] your logic is sound, it's just the stock pick that's horrible imho.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 17:14:44'] Sell the BID
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 19:41:08'] The deeper the option is ITM doesn’t always equate to higher intrinsic value. You have to factor in IV as well. bc if IV is super high it generally returns to its historical average. As IV drops so does your premium. So you need to watch out for IV crush. You also need to think about getting filled bc there isn’t a lot of volume that deep ITM. Food for thought.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 20:35:48'] Liquidity is not the issue. It’s the market tanking and taking TSLA with it. Play TSLA short term and you will make money. Beyond 2022, I think you will be crushed.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 21:49:32'] Just buy 50k worth of shares. If it goes to 2K you make 80k. If it gets cut in half you loose 25K. with options if price gets cut in half, you will lose it all.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-21 18:55:10'] Like others have said, you should be fine. Also, this is Tesla. I would worry too much about liquidity.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-22 04:22:14'] You might consider rolling the contract with 3-6 months left too. The theta decay (erosion of time value of the option) increases exponentially in the last 3-6 months. It might not matter much if it’s very deep ITM, but something to consider if you still like the stock and want to keep the position at a new strike at that time. I’ve started a similar strategy for SPY, and I’m totally with you on the concept! I was worried about this same thing, glad to see some people don’t believe it will be an issue for a small number of contracts.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 20:54:17'] It is not a problem on very liquid tickers like TSLA.The intrinsic value is just the UL price minus the strike price. The extrinsic value is basically the rest of the option value, the time value in theta, and will decay over time until only the intrinsic is left at expiration.Lets say your call remains deep in the money at 100 delta all the way up to expiration week. You will offer to sell it for the intrinsic value plus some extra premium. That extra premium is basically a fee you are paying to the counterparty in exchange for their liquidity. Some big trader with deep pockets will buy your 100 delta call, pocket the $50 bucks or whatever tiny bit of juice is left in the extrinsic premium, and short sell 100 shares against it to balance out any risk involved. They get low risk profits and you get your position closed. The liquidity will dry up and the bid-ask will get very wide, but when you offer enough extrinsic premium to cover the risk-free rate for the counterparty, some algo will jump on it automatically.

	COMMENT: ['2018-09-29 00:55:36'] The stocks movement causes the change in IV, not vice versa. It sounds like you need to read more about what volatility and implied volatility means. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-29 07:22:34'] This is a well known fact to people who sell options, but it is the price movement that comes first.When the price of an underlying goes down, especially when it goes down rapidly, the implied volatility rises, and can stay higher for a while.  This can also occur when an underlying rises rapidly, the IV may rise. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-29 06:36:46'] Take a look at a VIX chart and compare it to SPX.  There's a reason VIX is called the "fear gauge".  Gold is one asset where IV and price are positively correlated.
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-28 23:22:50'] Probably because there hasn't been a lot of positive news about Tesla lately. Bad news breaks, the stock drops significantly, IV spikes. Times passes, things settle out, IV drops, the stock climbs back upward. Rinse and repeat. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-29 07:30:39'] It’s called the leverage effect, and it’s extremely well known. Volatility rises when stocks fall, mainly because of how volatility is calculated, and how sell offs happen way faster than normal stock growth.This is pretty basic stuff tbh
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-29 12:37:50'] Recall that volatility is a property of the option contract and not a property of the underlying.  Implied volatility is not measured directly, your broker is taking the price the option is actually trading at and computes the volatility from that.Also, correlation does not mean causation.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 20:58:14'] nah the record date is meaningless as far as you and i are concerned. it’s just for brokerages and corporate accounting. if you buy a share tomorrow and sell it to Jimbob next week - on the books YOU get 4 more shares on the 31st. but all the brokers also know that you sold to Jimbob so theyll just forward those shares along to him. the only date we care about is the split date. same applies to any option contracts you buy. (i cant comment on how either date could effect option premiums)

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-14 10:54:14'] Everything will be scaled up or down proportionally so if the 1800 call had a premium of $200 before the split, after the split you would have 5 of the 360 calls with a premium of $40.I am assuming that everything stays the same pre and post split which might not be the case. The whole reason for TSLA to do this is the expectation that with a cheaper price more retail traders can jump in which *might* bring some more volatility to it.

I bought a total of 900 shares, paying $7984, $8.87/share. The CCs in that time frame gave me $517 premium. I rolled them near expiry most of the time, starting out OTM, but as the share price rose, they were ITM. While all this was going on, I collected $247 in dividends in 2Q and 3Q 2021.This month, they were far enough ITM that it was worthwhile for someone to extingish their extrinsic value to collect the dividend, and because today, Oct 26, is the ex-div date, they were called away early. I got $10 per share on them, for $9000.So, total gains were 1016 in capital equity appreciation, 517 premium, and 247 dividend, for a total of $1780 on $7984 invested, a gain of 22%. I held the average share about 5 months, so that annualizes to 53% ROI. I am very satisfied with this.Now could I have made more? Sure, the shares are presently trading for $11.22 a share, so some one got that extra. What premium they paid to get it, I cannot say. But I made good money, and am off to other investments.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 10:00:10'] A lot of how you trade depends on your risk tolerance - we sell out of the money puts on stocks that wouldn't mind owning. The basic strategy is:  \- choose stocks and ETFs with liquid option series  \- narrow down to stocks we wouldn't mind owning at a cheaper price  \- look at annualized yield for different expirations to determine the best one to sell   \- a few other more complex parameters around vol skew, technicals, earnings, portfolio etc  Two real examples below (disclaimer: not recommendations), to give you a sense of what you would make:  SPY:  Sell the Dec3 380.00 strike PUT  Cash needed: $38,000 (fully cash covered)  Days to expiry: 39  Theoretical price: $0.51  Annualized yield: 1.2%  ARKK:  Sell the Dec3, 112 strike PUT  Cash needed: 11,200 (fully cash covered)  Days to expiry: 39  Theoretical price: $2.42  Annualized yield: 20.4%  So, as you can see, for an ETF the lowest risk would be 1.2% per year, the more risky would be 20.4% return on your cash.  You can turn that up by:  \- selling single stock options (take a look at COIN or SNAP to get an idea)  \- using margin (but if you get assigned, you'd have to manage very carefully - doesn't happen often if you're selling 10-20% out of the money, but it does, so beware!)  Hope that helps!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 09:28:41'] Very interesting question and answers. Even though I picture it a bit too stressful to make a living based on options trading. I am just getting started and I don’t have much experience with options but to make a living you have to trade short term and that does not comply with my risk tolerance. I would only risk a small four digit amount on short term trading - but appreciate that other strategies and personalities prefer otherwise! Key point is that I wouldn’t say it’s a general dream, it has to comply with your risk and stress tolerance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 12:34:02'] I deposit $50 a month and collected $121 on premium this month on $7000 collateral for 2 puts and 1 CC.  Very conservative picks.  1.7% this month.  I aim for  %30 annually in premium... But this month I am a little shy of that because I have a CC that I don't want to write lower than my basis. Should make up for the annual return gap with CC profit if it ends up itm.  Otherwise rinse and repeat next month.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 14:15:49'] It is a good strategy to get extra cash and invest back or get more shares. It is not reliable above 4-5%, it needs a lot of time to roll and learn some wheel strategies.&#x200B;For me, I just do weekly or bi-weekly calls on QQQ, ARKK, AAPL and AMD. All are good stocks to keep for long term as well. But on QQQ, I can barely make above 2% in an year. I heard people make up and above 5% but going to be tough. When your shares get called, it gets nasty and rolling will pause your earnings but that is what I do to keep my shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 16:40:50'] Make a living? Not exactly, but I supplement my returns selling both.  No margin.  I usually net 8-12k per week; .3-.7%  I tend to buy on Fridays for the extra premium but generally go for weeklies.  For the PUTS, you got it; stocks I don't minding more of.  CALLS it depends upon the premium and I may go a couple weeks out.  I tend to sell both on AMZN, COST, MSFT, AAPL; the names with enough volume that I can easily get out if need be.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 20:06:43'] Yes. Been switching between selling puts and buying covered calls weekly with MARA. Averaging 4-5% a week. I go ITM with puts and a few dollars OTM with c calls. Been working out week for the few months. I know this won’t last forever. Trying to capitalize on the Bitcoin run up expected
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 22:26:56'] options are for reducing risk, whether you are selling or buying them. So that means w.e tickers you are using them on in CC or csp, you should want to own those companies....At least enough that youd be willing to average down multiple times.For myself I only use xsp.to. If i had usd, id use the spy.I do covered calls and csp. for cc, i try to get 1.5-2% (premium + net strike price). For Puts, I try for about 1% under atm.for both, I ladder up and down. I always have cash/buying power available.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-31 12:49:26'] GDX call diagonal spread. Will cost something like maybe $400 at most and you will earn it back over time. If you’re really bullish sell very wide put spreads against it too. Usually I would say to keep them wide but if you’re already really levered up use the sold call premium as a way to offset the loss on the put spread if your bullish assumption is wrong. You’ll pay off this position in about a year assuming there isn’t a massive breakout or a massive decline. In my opinion there is no way we will see a huge decline in the GDX in fact I will personally send you the $500 dollars if the GDX falls more than 20% in the next year.

The reason for the drop was chatter that the Chinese government was going to limit the amount of tutoring that could be done in certain segments at certain times. A huge proportion of students were paying for tutoring. The students did this in order to better compete, and the feeling was that the government wanted to reduce student academic stress and family financial stress.I felt the company could deal with a moderate reduction in revenue.What the government wound up doing was much more severe than anyone expected: they said the tutoring services had to become not-for-profits.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 12:01:19'] Worst series of trades was during the Covid decline. Over leverage and bad choices led to a margin call and a 66 percent drawdown.As far as single trades, I wrote at length about being short strangles on Boeing when the two planes went down. Stock cratered about 100 points, some of the options were 10000 percent losers because I sold way otm premium and bought back at 100x the price Another bad one was short way otm Chipotle puts. I was comfortably way otm on expiration day, when one of the food scares hit. I was assigned. Had I closed it would have been another monumental loss.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 17:53:05'] Sold puts on SPRT (somehow) completely oblivious to the merger. I was selling them well before SPRT became a meme stock and stopped when it did. On its way back down I started selling again. This was at a time in my life when I really didn't have time to trade, and I never should have traded SPRT after that huge run anyways... But I did. What hurts the most is that the day before the merger I opened my CSPs for the next month, but didn't close my previous month's puts. I just had to squeeze the last of the credit apparently :(.Anyways, woke up to having my portfolio down 25%. Within another month I was down 50%. Keep in mind that this was after a year of break even trading. So it definitely came unexpectedly and sucked. But I'm glad it happened. It taught me a lot.I still haven't gotten back into trading, but that's mostly because of time restraints. I'm at a new school this year and there is a lot more work than I had my previous year. I'm also working to help supplement my parent's income, so time is definitely not on my side currently.

Was working great because I didn't mind losing the shares and I was getting good premium off the  volume. I'd sell the covered calls for a strike price only .50 or a dollar above what I paid for a quick in and out knowing it's all pump and dump.  I screwed up with $SDC. It ended up dropping so fast there was no premium to even make after the initial call failed to expire in the money. Held bag for another month only to sell at a 60% loss.

POST_TEXT: b'**Preamble:**  The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-10 07:26:27'] If people invested their money in a robo app like Titan, they would have made more return than these senators beating SPP 500 in the last 3 years by 40%. One could attribute that to tech frenzy. Beating SPP by 10% is not alarming over such a short span. What would be interesting to see is if the moves they made were after key decisions were made regarding these companies. Looks like Microsoft defense deal was something that pulled in most senators to put their money into Microsoft. Very important skew to analyze and investigate further. Nevertheless, great analysis. Doesn’t look like a scandal, yet.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-10 22:13:15'] The benchmark you used to compare returns are misleading in my humble opinion.  The overwhelming majority of the stocks listed in the top 10, weighted by amount of capital allocated by a specific senator, are effectively current or future S&P100 stocks.One could argue they’re really Dow30 stocks.  Is that a surprise to anyone?  **“To say it: I generally am in agreement with what your thesis stated.”**I just have some questions to ask. The risk-off transition as an individual ages may be a confounding factor. One’s individual horizon may greatly differs from another.  What other available statistic studies have you run to compare and constraint the results, of the other results?Just some questions to think about.  I think most of us know senators have an inherent “social” alpha conferred upon them states they represent, and therefore the senator gains control over the economic outcomes of the states in all its entirety. *That’s an edge, no doubt, clean cut.*

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-10 06:57:24'] So the senator who made a bunch on Tesla… that’s something tons of people did. I’ll admit I didn’t read the whole thing, but what I’d like to see is two things: normalize the data on a per trade or per stock basis: did the over-performance come just from a few big companies that they invested more heavily into than the SPY? (This would indicate that their success is not from insider trading but from just being smarter and better advised). The other thing is to contrast the stock picks against volume. I don’t care if senator X is excited about Tesla. I care if they’re excited about some rare earth mining company in fuckstown, ND that no one has heard about. What are legislators doing that non-legislators aren’t?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 18:42:33'] Time to buy puts on this p.o.s.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 16:51:02'] You had me lost for a bit. I read this as TLSS smashes earnings and got so confused looking at the numbers.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-27 03:07:12'] I agree that the earnings report was very good for Tesla, but I disagree with a lot of your assumptions or opinions at the end. 1.  To say that this means all the talk about Lucid or Nio not being competition is a little short-sighted.  For one, Lucid will just now be delivering products to consumers in this upcoming quarter, so we can’t know whether it’s a better product or not until we see it.  Nio for their part is actually doing quite well in China which poses a threat to Tesla’s ambition in trying to gain market share there.  Let’s not forget the fiasco surrounding Chinese customers not happy about the QC in their newly delivered Model 3s.  And with the Chinese government basically saying Tesla spies on Chinese citizens, this could have an impact on sales in the region.  If Nio is able to expand production and penetrate markets beyond Asia, they may indeed be a force to be reckoned with.  And let’s not forget Rivian, GMs electric push, Toyota entering the space next year, and the success of Hyundai/Kia.2. You mentioned Tesla AI being an attractive feature for the future of autonomous driving, but you failed to mention that Tesla believes in going all in on just using cameras for their autonomous system. This is a HUGE problem as the cameras are only reliable in certain weather conditions and there is no fail safe in place when the system fails.  Why do you think every other major car manufacturer and autonomous driving companies use a host of sensors including LiDAR?  It’s because autonomous driving is only as good as the ability of the system to gain as much information as possible from the environment and be able to process that data.  Not to mention engineering redundancy is a great way to have a fail safe measure in case something happens.  If camera 23 goes bad or no longer functions properly (which camera failures happen in cars a lot), then the LiDAR is able to provide a fail safe to pick up where that camera left off.  Is there a glare preventing camera 11 from capturing data? No worries, the sensors can provide information where that camera can’t. Which brings me to my last point…3. Tesla is great because of Elon but it also has many shortcomings because of Elon’s ego.  In fact, if Tesla were to fail tomorrow it’s most likely because his ego got in the way.  This is what keeps some investors weary of the company.  Elon said he thought LiDAR was dumb technology that wasn’t needed and is doubling down on cameras only as the solution.  The biggest complaint in the new Plaid models is the steering wheel, with even Marques Brownlee saying it would be a great car except for this and yet Elon Musk is doubling down saying he won’t offer any other type of wheel.  It’s Elon’s ego that can end up being the downfall of the company.  And that’s something investors have to be mindful about.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 18:42:27'] You're clueless if you think VW and F will produce a greater volume of EVs than Tesla at a lower average cost. When do you expect this magical transformation to occur?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 18:22:39'] I streamed the call and I did not like the tone of the call, this was going to be a nothing call anyways as nothing new was really going on but I did not like a few things about it. 1. Elon did not sound optimistic about anything, he kept telling us why things were taking time vs telling us when things were going to finish. 2. He wavered on next year growth between 50 and 100%, this is telling me that he thinks they'll get delivering new cars out of the new factors in Q2 next year or late Q1. 3. We won't get to 1M vehicles this year, not that we have to, but about 830-850k inline with analysts. 4. FSD isn't ready and he didn't hype it at all. 5. Subscriptions were a bust as he didn't hype it, he eve said "at this point the value proposition on subscriptions are so-so, we need to get FSD done". Doesn't sound we see the light at the end of the tunnel. I think 2021 is going to be pretty sideways for the stock, it reminds me of the 2018 when we knew that China was going to open and we were looking for the 5k per week number and went through production hell, then came out the other side of it. At that point the stock started rallying, once Tesla got some scale. We are going through that again, but this time with 2 factories, an entirely new way of building cars, with brand new battery chemistry, with brand new ways to install the batteries in the cars with brand new factors in brand new places and during a chip shortage. So this earnings call asked for patience and we'll give Tesla as much time as they need, its super hard to do what they are doing and we ask too much too soon. My opinion is that the stock will just hang around until we see some clarity and results like in 2018, so a great time to buy more! Every month just buy more.

	COMMENT: ['2017-07-09 20:42:09'] link would help
	COMMENT: ['2017-07-10 04:27:16'] TSLA is very vulnerable to short squeezes.  The squeeze comes from when shorts get to such a bad P/L on their position they have to buy back the stock or get blown out. All the buying to cover has the same effect as buying to open, it brings the price up, making the situation harder and the remaining shorts.
	COMMENT: ['2017-07-09 21:06:20'] the answer is that, with "ample lendable stock borrow inventory available"more initiated short positions would make up for the lightweights getting margin called.
	COMMENT: ['2017-07-10 00:43:33'] @jimboofbx has a great point about the sort of entities that compose the short-sellers of $TSLA (although some retail traders also do short-it.As for your main question @Quercuspagoda ...1. You are right, a 'price' short squeeze is exactly as you defined it, however...2. What nobody has touched on it and is hinted in the article you shared, there are a few flavors of short squeezes. The author of that article was very specific about that squeeze being a "technical stock loan related short squeeze". That's why @pewpsprinkler @novacpa are right...because they're talking about a 'forced' squeeze.I think your confusion may come from the fact that some squeezes aren't technically related. These squeezes are just traders short the stock who want to minize losses so they *choose* (rather than being forced) to cover a stock.
	COMMENT: ['2017-07-11 07:10:06'] "Ample lendable stock borrow inventory" is short-sighted. This time last year the stock borrow rates for TSLA were ranging between -20% and -100% or worse. Whoever wrote that hasn't been tracking TSLA for very long.

So for all intents and purposes w.r.t your spread, it's like the split never happened at all.So if you think that Tesla will stay at or above 2060, hold it to expiry :)Always close it just before expiry, though. You don't want to deal with the aftermarket shenanigans.

But I'm not a US resident just to clarify, but out of curiousity as I was going through charts of the top gainers on friday with a volume above 1M, it seemed to me that compared to my country's exchange, the stocks in the US move much less on the 5 min. chart.Was friday the norm for how much the stocks move in the US or was it a slow day?

POST_TEXT: b"**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that its justified, given their clickbait titles or 5 can't miss stocks of the century or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,\n\n>If r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks can agree on one thing, its that Motley Fool is utter trash\n\nNow that thats out of the way, lets come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fools premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4Xed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.\n\nBasically, **What I wanted "
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:36:59'] I hope you enjoyed the analysis. I have a sub where I do similar analysis. Do check it out if you are interested.In case, you missed out on my previous analysis you can find it below. a.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 07:02:57'] I've been telling people on Reddit but no one listens. Their actual paid subscription recommendations do outperform the market long term. But for some reason people can't separate that from the b.s. articles on their web site. The two things are two completely different entities. Freelancers write those articles and they have ZERO to do with the advisor service and recommendations. TLDR, the MF stock advisor service does work as advertised. Hate all you want.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:15:26'] Some anecdotal evidence here, I used to subscribe to SA some 15 years ago (left because I went on a student loan paying binge for a few years and never came back).  They made recommendations on Marvel and Netflix and a few other good ones. If I had kept my initial investment in NFLX I would be a retired multimillionaire today.What TMF doesn’t exactly tell you in the stupid advertising is that these folks actually do real research into their companies. And not just fundamental analysis either. They’ll call the CEOs and talk strategy. Look for real industry leadership.  Research competitors.  Put in some honest legwork (or at least they tell you they do these things). More research than I usually do anyways, but that’s not saying much I suppose.Look, I’m not some paid shill, my experience with them in the ‘00s was fine. Good actually. And I whatever y’all can hate me for my opinion, but not everything they do sux.Also, FWIW, I work in the water treatment field and our company is an industry leader. One of the ways we keep on top of our competitors is to write a bunch of fluff blog posts and hold light-on-content webinars that keep people engaged. Our website is the top result on a bunch of search keywords. How do we do this?  Campy marketing tactics. Ded serious.  Is it pathetic?  Maybe.  Profitable?  Absolutely.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:45:47'] I actually didn't know that the opinion of TMF was that they were trash, but that's because I'm old enough to be familiar with their work before the click bait era, and I definitely agree that they went all in on the trashy marketing.I've seen multiple analyses like these over the years, of their various newsletters, and it's always supported that they know what they're doing, but also that they're willing to compromise best returns to sell you their best effort on whatever the latest trend is, even if the trend isn't a great strategy. It's not that they'll sell you crap, they may just be selling you on what they honestly think the best of the crap is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 07:00:11'] I think your conclusion is right on. I've talked to a number of people who work there (back-end tech side) and they all pretty much know this. They hate the spam too, but it works. It's a weird company in that respect. Stock Advisor is actually a good product from what I can tell, but they also up-sell like crazy and the expensive products don't have the same track-record of performance. Cynically, SA is the entry-level credibility establisher. Getting people from 0 to >0 spend is the hardest part in the sales funnel, so they have their strongest product at >0, but affordable. Then they actually give you a good product to build a solid core SA subscriber base. But this also establishes a core of people willing to spend money on newsletters. Then the up-selling kicks in. Once you've established that someone has money, is willing to give it to you, and you've convinced them that you're not scamming them (and SA isn't), then you can sell the expensive stuff. If you get 1 person into an expensive product it's worth annoying a lot of low-tier subscribers, many of whom will deal with the annoyance because they like the product they're getting. Their newsletter margins come from selling Super Big Tech Trends 3D Printing VR Growth 10000x Newsletters for 2-10k/year. Same logic applies to outside sales; you need crazy amounts of spam to drive subscriptions and they sure know it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:41:42'] This is really interesting thank you for the time you’ve put into it! I’d love to see the same analysis performed with the free stock picks in their clickbait articles, and maybe a side by side comparison of that analysis with your one, could be interesting!

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:27:28'] I feel like I dabble in both worlds. I’m a premium subscriber who loves the premium content. But absolutely despise their clickbait advertising and the free content (typically trash). If you can get past those two things, stock advisor has a great track record.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 07:18:40'] I say this on every motley fool post that I see. The fool is not the ads you see it’s the SA service and that service far exceeds the standard.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:37:55'] Did they increase the subscription price? On their website it now says the stock advisor is $199/yr.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:40:28'] 1. Is there a possibility that MF withdraw their bad takes from the past?2. Can you get a risk/beta adjusted performance, then compare to SPY? There’s a tendency MF that promote smaller cap stocks and small cap is easier to outperform large cap (where spy is tilted to)
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:57:52'] Did you look at the sector/industry breakdown and/or the value/growth tilt of their stock picks? I mean if a lot of their recommendations are tech or growth names then it would make sense they outperform SPY, since tech and growth has killed it over the last 8 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 07:54:12'] They have a free podcast where they give plenty of good analysis, discussion and stock picks (some are watch list worthy only, but still)[Link here](https://open.spotify.com/show/7tXRc97C1fA0epHAGQuJOE?si=JgZJr9ZQTIufI5JMVYVcNQ)
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:50:25'] Probably because they have their own hedgefund and every stock they pick seems to be in their 13f filing with the SEC. Weird how that works, isn’t it?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 07:09:59'] Spot on: Over 3 accounts, motley premium membership has me up 77%, 94% and 133% over the past year. Similar gains the two years prior. It’s a great way to restrict my own dumb ideas on what might make money and operate mostly within their picks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 12:16:41'] I would love to see a comparison against the nasdaq. I’m a current SA subscriber, but considering just getting QQQ or similar. Since their recommendations are usually tech heavy, I don’t think they have beat the nasdaq by much.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 05:54:25'] Nice analysis. Their business model is incredibly annoying, its like if you read one of their articles once you can never escape them again. That being said, their recommendations seem to be an easy way to take a chance at outpacing the market—although they are certainly not the only source out there recommending these stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 09:04:24'] This is awesome, thank you for the analysis. I have used SA for years now. I only use it for the stock recommendations which have allowed me to beat the market so far, but that's about it. I don't like their marketing emails and I don't read much of their articles. I do listen to the RBI podcast which is usually aimed for the beginner investors. Overall, I enjoy what I get from them and look past the click-baity ads. They're an easy target since it's impossible to produce quality investing content daily. They're investing more long term and that doesn't align much with the goals of the redditors calling them trash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 09:12:58'] I was somewhat shocked at learning that Motley was basically a hedgefund.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 12:38:42'] Ha! This is great work. Not the results that I expected but I guess I do know the truth now. That’s said I still hate their click bait (while fully understanding why they have to be click baity)

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 18:25:12'] Yup. Have used Canada and US service and they track all recommendations. Have consistently beat market and before people hate on MF take a look at their site, not click bait articles but their site.They recommend emergency fund, give basic educational walk through of personal finance and investing and the last step is invest in market and hold. They aren’t fucking around w people’s money and have a long track record of adding value through prudent advice.Makes the sloppy click bait articles even more frustrating but taken on the whole it’s sooo clear you have to give them respect.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 23:28:21'] I did a similar study where I simulated myself "buying " the stock the day after it was recommended to prevent a more real-world scenario where you can't buy the stock immediately after it is recommended.  It was still way ahead of SPY.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-01 00:12:17'] It’s just a media company for a hedge fund. Fuck them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-01 06:27:22'] This analysis is missing *one* thing. The relative size of the companies in question at time of suggestion. The reason I say that is I have a feeling, though I can't provide for it, that the companies selected by Stock Advisor likely are just "drifting". What I mean by this is that they are mid-cap companies with little to no threat of going bankrupt; in that case the odds that they will rise naturally over time are very high.If one were to invest in a 5 factor model type portfolio one should beat the market by means of simply reducing diversification, that is, one never buys the losers with the winners, and so if one doesn't have the "drag" one doesn't have bad returns. This is the same problem as putting all of your money into Amazon; it would look like a genius move today to do so but if you had factored it and decided that it was a sound investment 2x years ago you'd have made a lot more than the SP500 specifically because Amazon *in* the SP500 is being dragged *down* by other things.I don't know how much of the portfolio recommendations are in the SP500 today but if it's a large enough amount one of the key factors for them could have been just choosing what would enter into that index, or rather, any index; companies that "qualify" but aren't actually in the indices are also high priority targets simply because in order to get into an index you have to have your finances right to begin with and you need to be, among other things, particularly business savvy which means no one is afraid you'll go bankrupt.The sell recommendations probably run the same logic; much like we pick winners by looking at their fundamentals and likeliness of maintaining value and future-forward concepts there's a good chance that they either dump or discourage things that are either no longer viable or almost impossible to maintain. For instance the Tesla recommendation wasn't actually a "bad" one; 2020 was a strange year for certain but the odds that Tesla would have been in play in that year without all that was going on are probably not that high. The same is true for a number of closures of businesses as well; it required an extraordinary event to take the mundane to godlike. Now I'm not saying that Tesla isn't an industry leader or that it's CEO isn't who he is but I am saying that the widespread nature of the concept here is significantly dependent on the timing rather than the merits of the business itself and the viability of the technology which is still in early stages.I guess what I am saying is that without an analysis of just the general nature of the companies suggested and when there's a missing link; there's likely a sound commonality between the companies that can effectively be taken with little effort but they're counting on people simply not doing that; furthermore we do have a recursion to consider, that is, much like Kramer, if it appears in "The Fool" the natural outcome of that company may be changed and the trajectory raised esp. since they release, like Morningstar and others, their own price projections which I assume they release in their own favor meaning that they generate the buzz, set the price floor, and then let drift work on companies that were generally mundane but also relatively safe or with competent serial entrepreneurial leaders who don't fail often in businesses.That's what I think is under the hood of the data itself. Not that I am saying the data isn't valid, it is, it's just that history rarely produces rational propositions on how something occurred and instead just expresses that it occurred.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 08:04:54'] The issue tmf has is that it needs to attract an audience to buy its premium services and the way you do it in the current internet era is via clickbait. Once you are in the ecosystem the quality improves. If they were only doing dry and boring articles they would only attract a tiny audience.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 09:06:41'] Since 2013? That's a bull market. You should do it from like 2000 or something

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 08:31:14'] Also they have a hedge fund, so that’s probably why the produce the content they do. They need someone to pump and dump certain stocks they’re hedged against... why not have your own media arm do it?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 09:01:55'] Thanks for an honest review. I am a 2 year customer of MF and have no complaints. I learned early to turn off all the unnecessary notifications. I agree they can be annoying, but not any more so than all the other advertisers who continue to harass me across the internet even though I already bought their product. I get that the majority of reddit investors are younger and prefer big bets and big wins. Its fine. Their isn't one strategy to rule them all. You can diversify investing strategies as well as the individual investments. every strategy can get cult like. I posed the question of diversifying strategies in a boglehead forum and immediately got taken down. Do you and f\*\*\* the haters. Multiple strategies lead to multiple learning experiences.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 10:24:26'] That's because it came from Tom and Dave the literal heads of Motley Fool of course it's good. Everyone else, the writers are just writers. Their shyte and don't even take the positions they recommend and if they do, they have shitty hit and return rates.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:21:50'] Interesting, very interesting. As I understand your source it's based of 91 recommendations over 8 years, which is legit data for premium users and shows that paid content has some kind of axxountability... But the crap the put out on a daily basis for free as click bait articles would be interesting to know, whether that garbage journalism also outperforms the market or just pushes a speficic narrativeNonetheless good effort dude 👍🍌
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:42:26'] Excellent work, thanks. Do you have any feel for the average beta of their buy recommendations? I.e. is it possible they've outperformed due to just picking higher-beta stocks during a bull market?

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 07:52:03'] I wonder if there's any effect from the fact that people buy en masse at the same time....sometimes as many as a million, apparently. That wouldn't necessarily give a sustained pump if the company was not a good company but if most Motley Fool subscribers buy and then just hold until they're told to sell, it might impact smaller cap stocks on a long term basis. Almost like pumping I guess.Did you get all the spammy low quality stuff they recommend in there? I have gotten ads recommending crappy cannabis stocks and the Crown Realty REIT (on the theory that "5G" would require cell providers to en masse lease much more from Crown)

If all they do is recommend stocks they think will do well or poorly, but don't tell you exactly when and what you should buy and sell, the performance of their recommendations can't be quantified or backtested.TMF does have an actual, real-world portfolio we can backtest: The Motley Fool 100 ETF (TMFC). It only goes back to Feb 2018, so the backtest results aren't necessarily a great predictor going forward, but it's what we've got.TMFC has indeed trounced the S&P 500 since inception, but since TMFC is essentially a large-cap growth fund, a fairer comparison would be to a large-cap growth index. VUG (Vanguard Large-Cap Growth Index) should be a reasonable proxy. Since it was created in Feb. 2018, TMFC has outperformed VUG by 1% annually. All of the outperformance happened in 2018; since 2019, the two are basically even.

POST_TEXT: b'I got in a vertical call on Tesla when it was 278 with a 305/310 strike price and AUG 18 Exp. I paid 15.03 for the 305, and received 13.33 for the 310. With Tesla currently being way higher than I expected at 344, I was wondering if there was anything I could do to maximize my profits on this other than just let it expire.

	COMMENT: ['2018-06-13 17:50:15'] I asked something very similar in the noob thread, as I had an AMD vert spread that was well itm. What I’ve found is that your earnings aren’t exactly capped, because the price of the options don’t grow at the same rate. For example my AMD call had a max profit of .77 at maturity but the gap was 1.02 today so I closed it out at that. Someone who knows a lot more about options can probably give you a better answer but you might be best off just closing it out and getting better ROI elsewhere. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-06-13 17:51:50'] There is a way to do so, by adjusting your trade, but it involves significant risk.  Since you believe TSLA has more room to move upwards, you could modify your trade by buying back the short credit call for a high price now, before the cost of buying it back grows more, and let the long debit call continue to run upwards in value, according to your belief and projection. This would be risky, because of the high value of each option.A less risky method is to put a new trade on, and close out the original trade somewhat closer to the August expiration.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 11:38:24'] IV is on a contract by contract basis. The same underlying can have different IVs across all option contracts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 11:57:26'] The price of an option is calculated from a number of components:Underlying, Strike Price, Days to Expiry, Interest Rate, Option Type and X.Among the entire list above, the **first 5 are always known at any given point of time**. So why does an option price still vary keeping the first 5 factors constant. It's the variable X. That represents the "**error**" or "**uncertainty**" in the calculation. It is also termed as IV - IMPLIED volatility.So to calculate what an option price should be at the moment, you need to know what the IV is. You could assume a number, let's say 40% and use that to calculate the price of the option. Let's say the price of the option on calculation, comes out to be $1.5.Now the next step depends on what your goal was:1. Was your goal to find out the price of the option given that you think the IV was 40%.2. Or was your goal to find out the IV.&#x200B;1. If your goal was the former, then it's done, you know the price is $1.5 given an IV of 40%. (This goal is generally for people who are doing projections of option pricing assuming certain market conditions.)2. If your goal was the latter, then you check whether the price of the option in the market is also $1.5. Let's say it's not, it's $1.2. You change the IV and use 30% to calculate the option price. Let's say this time it comes out to be $0.9. You change the IV again, and use 33% to calculate the option price, this time it comes out to be $1.1. If this is close enough for you, then you can assume the IV to be 33%. if it's not, then you use 34% to calculate and it comes out to be $1.22. Is that close enough? If yes, you can consider the IV to be 34%. If not ... so on and so forth till you are happy with the value.That's why IV is also called the "error" or "uncertainty" parameter. You iteratively calculate it by trial and error. You don't need to do it by hand, there are programs which do it for you based on the BS model.Hope that helped.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:48:24'] It’s on the underlying. But - supply and demand for the options contract pushes the price of that options contract around, and the resulting IV for that options contract is simply an output from the options-pricing formula. Knowing what the long-term IV is for that underlying is what informs you re: whether to buy or sell that option premium.Edit: I should clarify- the IV assumption associated with a specific options contract (either input into or derived from the options pricing formula) is the estimate of the annual standard deviation of the underlying security price. The OP’s question is a good one. I’m a long-time options trader, former market-maker at the CBOE. There are many nuances to this question and its answer, depending on the perspective of the question. Many of the answers/reply’s are getting to the heart of it but agreed, there are basics to be understood before some of these answers, and the perspectives they represent, will make sense. I’d agree, ignore the interpolation of IV to the expected stock price move over the next week/month/year. Supply and demand for options will create IV an an output that can be disconnected from the ‘reality’ represented by the OP’s stock price projection chart. Demand for insurance via wing puts drives up IV for those options, creating the vol smile or skew you often see for example. Hope this helps
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:43:04'] A very good question.Ok, to clarify. Each option has an individual IV. That means each strike, in each expiration cycle, and a Put or Call per strike.The underlying also has an IV. That is calculated for every expiration.We can see that in your example, or expressed as IV Index in the options chain. But since IV can only be derived from options, the 'underlying IV' must be based on the options within that expiration cycle. My understanding is that it is always the ATM option, because it is usually the most heavily traded, and it is the option's price that determines IV, and not IV that determines the price.I also researched this question but couldn't find a good explanation. It's probably somewhere in the Black Scholes formula which I am too lazy to work through  😂  Probably the commenter below who said that it's "sugar for dumb retail traders to rot their minds with, ignore it" got it right how it's calculated. But yes, your observation is correct that we have IVs both for options, and for underlyings (the "garbage calculation for retailers"), that are based on ATM options.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:40:50'] They are probably using the ATM IV for the relevant forecast length. Edit: it’s possible they are using the 15 delta strangle strikes as that’s approximately a +-1 standard deviation range. Though far more likely it’s the ATM vol.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 18:38:40'] It’s worth noting that option price implies an IV. And option bid price and option ask price imply different IVs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 09:39:05'] HV is the historic volatility for the underlying. IV is the reverse engineered pruct of the current prices. Let's say if the SPY 17Jun 396 straddle is trading at 23.0 that implies that the range for SPY between now and June 17th is 373-419. If it does trade within that range the HV will be 26.50, which is the current IV. If the IV decreases with each higher strike \[rice that means it moves slower to the upside. If the IV is higher with each lower strike price then the underlying moves faster to the downside than upside.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 11:42:25'] The IV of the option itself. The IV displayed by your broker for the stock is the result of the some combination of its different options IVs. There is no really standard way followed by brokers to get this combined number, which is why you'll see different broker having slightly different IVs for the same stock.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:42:24'] The price of an option given its strike and expiry implies a volatility for the underlying stock. This is made evident when you look at an options pricing model to see where the sigma in the model comes from.Superficially it may seem like, given that definition, that every option in the chain should yield the same IV, but of course they don't. On the other hand, their deviation from a single IV is not chaotic nor (very) random. Within the same expiry, for example, the mapping of the IV of all options in the chain will typically show a very systematic skew - a crooked smile with more of a smirk on the left side. (Generally this skew can be explained by hedging behavior and similar). To some extent this reflects that an options model does not and cannot reflect all of variables that actually connect an option price to its underlying price nor does the historical behavior of the stock itself perfectly reflect the assumed distribution of its behavior (lognormal for the stock and normal for the log growth rate of the stock). Finally and more important than anything else, the options pricing model that yields both the concept of historical volatility for the underlying and the estimated volatility of the same as implied by an option's price, is unable to incorporate any reasonable estimate of the price impact of a tail event, which explains why, at times like recent weeks in general for the market or just before earnings for specific stocks, IV rises, and it rises more for near-term expiries than long term expiries.There is no point in consolidating IVs and there is no such thing as an IV for an option (an option is volatile, but there is no measurement that "implies" its range). It is incorrect to say that IV will "tell you nothing." Even though strangely variable (to one just starting out), it is quite systematic and it is useful to compare IV measures to historical volatility of the underlying. It is IMO the must useful statistic in options trading.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 19:44:44'] Does Option IV counteract Delta?  If you look at any IV graph, IV increases with options that are further   away from underlying. IV increases options value. However Delta   decreases options value too. Thus in the end, Delta wins even though IV   increases like crazy, the option is nearly worthless when far away( but   has a high IV though)  As the underlying gets closer to strike price, the Delta increases but   IV decreases. This is probably the most confusing part to me, does Delta   always win? lol. Seems like IV and Delta are always countering each   other.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-26 05:57:20'] Considering it’s at 640 right now that’s not much of a move. I’m not at my computer but eyeballing it it looks probably like a one Sigma move, which is quite possible in either direction for Tesla

	COMMENT: ['2018-07-27 10:26:10'] I've agreed with this line of reasoning for a long time but thank god I didn't turn that into bet, especially with options.TSLA has been running with a third of their float shorted for many years and they have beat those shorts against all odds. There just seems to be too much of a fan-boy contingent to both support their stock and buy cars that need perpetual maintenance. At some point TSLA will probably collapse in a way that will make the FB debacle look like a little speed bump, but WHEN? is the question. Hard to get that right. And options? LOL, a TSLA Aug 16, 19 200 put, 385 days from expiry and $100 OTM is selling for $25. The 100 strike is only 7.75. Maybe that is the way to go! [Edit: spelling]

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 23:42:06'] You are right. It looks like the EMA4 is crossing down the EMA20 for a bear divergence on the 10 minute ticker but I am concerned about the RSI-- it looks way undersold. I would open up a straddle/strangle position and wait to see if a retracement actually occurs before I load up more on either side. Dang ITM puts with 10/29 DTE is going for at least 3k a pop. But but...if UPST actually does go down more than 7%, I'll make 4x/5x profit. That's 10k profit per contract. 100 contracts and you're a millionaire!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 19:36:33'] Really bummed I didn’t buy much of this stock. Sold a call for breakeven before earnings as well…I literally can’t get over it lol and will probably end up buying the peak. Someone reassure me that this will go back to $200 please

Which they benefit on both side on gain for calls and gain for puts also gain for shorting it. The same strategy being used over and over again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 08:12:23'] I was telling myself it was going to correct $210 (it didn’t). It’s had 3 corrections before, losing 30-50%. $250 is a fair target. It should probably go lower. Not sure how I’d play it with put options. The options for this are so distorted. Going short if you are able might be better.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-29 09:02:31'] Lending without credit score is nothing new. It has been existed and done for thousands of years in many countries which doesn't have a credit system like Americans. The notable Alibaba has been doing personal loans without credit scores long before UPST. There is no credit system in China and lots of other countries. Even in America lots of private lenders are fighting in this no credit required personal loan business. Amazon kept offering the small business loans without checking anything along with many private lenders when they charge 8-9 percent interest.The red flags I see in UPST1) The earnings are not stable. They had a good year in 2019, then had a disastrous 2020 when their business almost done to zero. The high growth we see now is based on 2020. IThat says the business model highly depends on the overall capital market not safe proof.2) Their expansion into the auto market is over optimistic. Auto makers are offering nominal 2.9% interest to buyers with good credits, 5% to customers without a good credit score. UPST is charging from 6%-9% interest to their clients, I don't see how they would compete with the auto markers. It is reported they are buying Prodigy Software  for auto loans. They are not using their own AI platform?3) The insiders are selling their shares "phenomenally". WIthin 6 months their founder, co-founder, major company officers, the 10% owners are selling hilariously. No buying at all. If they are so confident the growth of their company, why they so eager to let their stock go? While analysts are recommending strong buy, the insiders are selling high.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-15 07:28:55'] I hope you learned your lesson. Don’t fuck with stocks with momentum. Just because something is going up doesn’t mean it has to go down.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 17:39:30'] I played this twice in the last month. First with a strangle when the IV was high. Then a put spread when it seem like it was breaking out. Closed both position at 50% profit. Been eyeing it but the IV is too low for premium selling and it hadn't shown any sign of slowing down. It barely dip on Monday. I'm sitting this one out until it shows some sort of sign of reversal.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 01:52:42'] I played some puts leading up to lockup expiration earlier this year and I'm very cautious with this stock because of the following:1. Last earnings were a resounding blowout, both in results and their guidance for the year (revenue projections from 600m to 750m, margin projections from 10% to 17%).2. Analyst coverage supports the current valuation and there are no recent outliers with a bearish position.3. Insider trading is still not raising any red flags. Gu Paul, one of their SVPs has increased their stock position from 200k in December to 432,412 last week.4. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've observed a reversal from value stocks to growth stocks since June, which accelerated in August.I'm pretty sure you're right about a correction/dump off, but I think you need some confirmation of a direction before making the trade.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 16:29:42'] Puts on UPST is almost never smart, speaking from experience. Analysts keep raising price targets, most recently to $250. CNBC predicated $600. I’ve been surprised quite a few times, when UPST had a strong bull run, only to fall a few points and continue back up. It’s also down in after hours already, and with this stock that’s a strong signal for a small dip at open followed by a bull run.However, out of all the put opportunities I’ve seen on this stock, tomorrow ranks as one of the best. This is not saying to much however, since the only reason behind this opinion is overall market sentiment/China.Overall, I won’t be shorting UPST until the entire market continues to see further corrections
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 16:16:17'] That’s a risky move; don’t do it.The stock is overvalued and the company’s products are not unique or competitive.While it may go back down, it is impossible to predict the rate, timing, duration, and depth of the decline.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 21:45:30'] Why is the current stock growth rate unsustainable?The stock has a low float. Last earnings were a blowout. It has high relative strength. It is at all time highs and the stock is so new that you have no historical breakdown areas - blue sky. I too feel its too high, I am not irrational. But I do not see any factors present that say this won't go past 350, 400, 500, 550. I just don't know. Neither do you. Therefore, there is no edge here. Also the puts are extremely expensive.I would wager buying puts on Apple is a higher edge trade than puts on UPST. With Apple there is at least a near term catalyst (ruling on App Store) that is likely to decrease Apple's earnings next quarter.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 20:33:00'] I don't see a case for a major pull back of UPST independent of the market. I just see that the market has priced in a robust growth in earnings for at least the next few years. Something like 30% y/y is tough to sustain but certainly not unbelievable. While the valuation is high for where they are today, that's totally consistent with how the market prices other growth stocks in this phase of their life cycle. Obviously, there will be pull-backs as there are with any stock, but I think you're just buying lottery tickets by trying to time that with puts.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 03:23:33'] Option prices on UPST have already priced in expected big drop in following months. Even the "close" Oct29 options already priced in 10% drop. That's a lot to bet against.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-21 22:29:06'] People were saying the same exact thing after last earnings, and I kind of agreed with them, but I knew the market was stoked so I avoided betting against $UPST. It's it more likely now that it will reverse then it was then? Of course. Does that mean it won't go higher before it reverses. Of course not.Wait for it to reverse before getting bearish, otherwise you may get bent over went it goes another 120% before next earnings.

POST_TEXT: b"Here's what I'm looking for...\n\nI have a large concentrated TSLA position, sitting at about 50% equity currently. My margin call price should be around $560. I also have strong conviction that Tesla will perform extremely well in Q3, but I have little conviction that it won't get crushed at some point between now and Q3 results.\n\nSo, while we're having this rally, I'd like to open some protective options that will save me from that potential margin call.\n\nSo I'd think the optimization here is for price per delta at $560, basically, and I'd like it to be really flat across now to Q3. Is there some software I can use to do this optimization? I've been poking around at optionsprofitcalculator but it is difficult to build an optimal strategy. Is there maybe a python version of that that I can build an optimizer around?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 09:57:34'] Use a collar. Sell a call and use the premium to buy a put. You can do this for close to 0 credit sometimes and can get up to -100 delta the closer to the money you sell
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 10:19:37'] Exit the stock, and buy ITM calls instead, 70-75 delta .. minimal time decay, and guaranteed no margin call.You can also then sell OTM calls against them. There are also ratio spread strategies that will eliminate all time decay.Frankly, with all of the available option strategies that could be employed, it almost never makes sense to buy or short a stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 10:25:43'] Wow TSLA Sep 560 puts are about 3700 each and way down at 20 deltas so the market gives that number roughly 20% odds of touch.  If TSLA gets there then you'll be at 50 deltas.  You can price those across varying DTEs left and IVs for your hypothetical crush point.   This kind of analysis is always fuzzy because you are also forced to predict the other Greeks ...But what kind of event will knock another 20% off ?  Are you thinking macro or something company (Elon) specific?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 11:24:17'] I think what you're looking for is something similar to the "Analyze" function in Thinkorswim (the software I'm using). Probably any major broker's software has something along similar lines.With it, I can basically choose all or any selection of my open positions for an underlying (stocks + options), add to them simulated trades if I want, and see in graph form how my account would be affected whereever the price goes (P/L, net liquidity, BP effect etc...)
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 18:06:02'] I’m in same boat, I used to sell far ITM puts for the premium but when the stock dips I tied up too much margin.

India and the US are by far their two largest customers and India site traffic is down nearly 100M from last quarter while US site traffic is up 50M but on the decline from September into October. Probably due to an uptick in COVID Delta variant cases in the US. This company still seems to only associate strong site traffic with COVID spikes. Even if they meet or beat revenue their growth going into next year won't be a justification for the absolutely ludicrous analyst price targets. The Metaverse buzzword that's popped up recently is cute but I don't see it being a viable pivot considering Facebook has Messenger Rooms which is a direct Zoom competitor.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 17:10:40'] Well, if you didn’t have a plan before entering a trade, you pretty much have nothing but emotion to trade on. Don’t enter any trade without having an exit strategy in place first. Establish what it is you’re trying to achieve, realistically. Hope is not a trading strategy, but “I will hold this X days, risking no more than $X to achieve a 30% return” is.

Just going back and looking at old trades and wondering what I was thinking drove me crazy, so now before I enter any position I force myself to write down why I think it's a good position and what my goals and exit strategy looks like. Taking the time to write it down takes you out of the emotional state of mind and then when you get antsy you can look at why you got in the position and determine if your hypothesis still holds. If it holds, don't exit. If something has changed, reevaluate.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 17:23:16'] This is hindsight bias. You could have just as easily lost everything if you didn't sell yesterday if the stock didn't rise and continued on its path. The only way to prevent situations like yours is to be an expert, but that's just not easy. If you're not a professional, then treat it so. View it as a game at a casino. You won't blame yourself for folding at a poker table when an unlikely card could have turned it around for you, right? That's just simple probability. You can't control it. If you want to be better, use the scientific process/method. Always ask yourself: what was your hypothesis, why did your hypothesis fail, and what can you learn.Edit: if you don't have a clear, provable hypothesis, then you're just gambling, and nothing you do really matters. If you can't handle loss, then it's probably best if you don't gamble.

Create and follow a trading plan.  Having a documented plan forces you to be accountable to yourself if anything else.2. You need to know how you intend to manage your trade to profit or loss.  It's crucial that you have this figured out before you enter the trade.  Trying to determine whether you should keep, close, or roll your position during the middle of the trade is a bad idea.  The information you have then will not be the same information you would have had in the beginning of the trade plan creation phase.3. Execute the plan.4. Improve your process.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 17:10:21'] Seems you became emotionally detached ... With options ,, my max loss is 50% and then I just bail with zero second guessing or emotion.  So, set a loss level and always do the same and your emotions are then OUT. Also, keep this in mind ... When a stock strays too far from this ... [http://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla](http://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla) .. you are better off doubling down. I usually take 1 or 2 contracts and as we get closer to expiration I consult the max pain and decide if I should double down based on that and the hourly chart action.  So, then I bail or double. Based on MaxPain .. you probably are right selling but maybe next time just see where max pain is. The stock will get help from those that control the options markets. You would then double down and then sell at the end of day today.  I sold NIO Call spread and watched it closely today and bought it back at the lows ... Then it ripped higher quickly ... Look at the NIO maxpain. This is why I took profits on my short call play as I expected it to bounce hard to try and get most options to expire worthless.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 19:31:50'] I've paid tuition to learn these lessons... 1st, you want to go in with a plan as to what your P&L targets are, and size them at a level relative to your account such that you won't panic sell and lock in a loss. Been there, done that, watched it turn around the next day. Seems to happen only on positions that are way too big a %age of my account.2nd, you want to make your plan as mechanical as possible so that your emotions don't get involved. I like to use limit orders for stop loss or profit target (or both, if your broker lets you do bracket/OCO (one-cancels-one) orders to set both at the same time. If you're looking at a trade and not feeling good about your exit points in total dollar terms or relative to the motion of the stock, downsize the trade or don't take it.I've also stopped buying plain calls and puts (after these last few, I promise) and have started buying debit spreads instead. Don't do this unless you know how to manage spreads (TL;DR never ever ever hold a spread into expiry + assignment), but with a debit spread you can either: get a call at a given strike for much less $ or for the same $ buy much closer to the money and have more delta on your side. If I have a strong directional thesis on a stock (and options aren't super expensive, e.g. relatively low IV), I've been experimenting with buying a 40+delta option as part of a debit spread, paying no more than ~30% of the spread width. 100% profit / 50% loss are my exit points, and buying these on a dip in the stock price helps majorly of course.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 17:26:30'] OP.. you are also assuming you would have sold today. Most likely this call will be worthless tomorrow. Trust me.. very easy to say different after the fact.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 19:48:43'] I know it’s out of context but perhaps do some research into scalping options. It will teach you a very solid entry exit strategy. Tesla today could have been an awesome call option by the end of the day but I made about the same profit off scalping options. Granted a human would have made same off buying an early call today but with the current market chop, I would have never bought a daily call and sat on it with confidence. I do believe tomorrow is going to be a big breakout day for Tesla.

You are human, you will have emotion. Just use it to fuel your brain, make decisions based on evidence. For example the kind of dip that made you sh*t your britches in Tesla isn’t sh*t for TSLA. That said, the thing you’re really messing up on is looking in the rear view mirror. You’re going to carry that with you into upcoming trades and it will burn you so dang hard it’ll make this look like a small patch of dandruff.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 19:41:29'] You need to compartmentalize these emotions. first and truly foremost, do not trade money you are not willing to lose. When you lose it, get the fuck over it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 23:01:27'] A lot of comments here, and a lot of them are good.  I'll point out though that what works for one person might not work for another.I suggest following the suggestions of making a trading plan and then follow it.  If paper handing on a dip isn't in your plan it's against the rules to do it.I also suggest either holding longer or shorter.  By longer I mean buy 2 months out (or longer) so you can shrug off dips because you have time for it to recover.  By shorter I mean if you're looking for a short term trade then plan on always exiting before end of day.Also, figure out what sorts of trades stress you out and avoid them.  I can't handle day trading, for example.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 23:19:23'] I only commit to options if a very stern and definitive statement flashes across my mind that says, “this WILL happen at X point tomorrow and I WILL sell at that moment.”Long as you keep your eyes from turning into $$ then you won’t be blinded by greed. Can always set a limit sell for less than what you expect so you don’t miss your exit by a tiny margin and end up in a negative trade.Theta drops throughout the day, high volume premarket will bleed theta dry by mid day. Low volume will cause a holding pattern.This works for me, everyone is different. I trade AAPL calls everyday since for some reason I have a good affinity for what will happen within the first hour each day. I’ve learned my crystal ball doesn’t extend very far and only trade within that window. 1 hour after open if I haven’t closed out my positions then I end up holding those, often for a loss.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 23:50:07'] Only invest money you don’t care about and don’t need right now. It’s only a loss when you sell. If you don’t care about the money and there’s no devastating news for the company’s stock to plummet, you can just hang on.I suggest trading for long term initially so you start doing some research. What’s the expected value of the stock and why, read about the financial markers and the company. You are buying a share of it, so you better love and trust it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-31 00:02:44'] I totally understand how you feel. When I first started trading, however, I was buying shares in companies I hadn't researched or knew much about. There were many times that I saw numbers going down and either panic sold early at a loss rather than riding out the dips, sold because there was a tiny bit of bad press, or hesitated YOLOing enough shares to really make a difference. Seeing prices rise and fall on some volatile stocks is an emotional rollercoaster.That being said, over the past year, I'm at almost 200% ROI because I decided to make educated buys in companies that I had/still have faith in (Tesla, Microsoft, Square, etc.) and then put my portfolio away and stopped watching it like a hawk. Most gains happen over time, and as long as you have faith that the companies you bought into are good investments, don't worry about the daily changes (unless you're a day trader, in which case CHASE THOSE DIPS AND SELL AT THE PEAKS LOL). Just think, Google and Apple didn't rise in value overnight. If you buy and hold, not only do you get that long-term tax break on gains, but you reduce the amount of stress in your life.TL;DR: 1. Research the companies you're interested in (DD is key)2. Buy the ones that you have faith in for growth potential.3. Pay attention to the news surrounding your investments.4. Don't helicopter-parent your portfolio(If you day-trade, ignore everything I said. Paper-handedness is part of the game. You'll learn to read trends and eventually get a good system going)

Know as long as you aren’t buying at the top of the market the shares have been at your bought value multiple times and with growth they will return there again. Focus on your real 9-5 job / studies - these gains should be gravy on top of your pay packet on the be all and end all. Can you live without the money you have at risk? If yes then it’s like putting a bet on and chill out. If no then you’ve over invested and you may want to look at your financial strategy again. Put a sell order on for the rest of your wanted holding period at a value you’re happy to sell at. Taking a less hands off approach.Also researching more may also help you calm your nerves as you’ll know good news is coming in the future works from that company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-31 07:33:16'] Not financial advice just some things I’ve learned trading for the past 6 years  First figure out why you are so emotional in the first place.Fear of lossFear of being wrongFear of missing outFear of loss comes down to your attachment to money...IE your mental model about money is flawed. Maybe you associate money with time or someone told you to save or you’ll be homeless and you will ruin your life blah blah...find it and fix it “scared money doesn’t make money”Fear of being wrong- this is pure self ego leave that at the door...your going to be wrong in a market accept it and move on. “The market will check your ego for you”Fear of missing out- missing the big run up or missing that 1000% trade. There will always be opportunities to make money in a market. “Patience pays”one of these is most likely the culprit to your tradesAn simple way to combat this is to have a system either- TA/FA/Order flow whatever works best for you do this and do it consistently and those dips won’t shake you out as much. And you will be more confident in your positionsDo less risky trades IE sell to open puts (cash secured) vs buying directional calls/puts Buy shares vs options to build confidence in system then work on timing the moves for better ROI on BTO calls/puts

The day after that, TSLA bounced back and deciding I didn't not want anymore whiplash, closed the contract for a tiny gain. The following week TSLA made its march up to 900 and at its peak my now-sold call ($500 premium initially) had become a 20x bagger worth $10k. That suuuuuucked. I kept checking on the value of my former call and kept going "WTF?!" every time. Need to be able to forget you ever had the contract once you bail on it.

Cash covered puts and covered calls taught me the discipline and patience to trade options because its money in the pocket from day 1 and theta decay lets you “reason” a current loss may turn positive before expiry.  It also taught me the discipline to know what price I want to buy and sell by understanding the underlying stock.  Plus, you learn how/when to roll your position if you play to near expiry dates.  I can make 1% a week on the bucket I’m playing with, but happy to settle for less.  My goal is 10% a year. You’ll also learn to time the better trades.  Prices closer to your strike price and even lower make selling put options more lucrative.  I sold an AAPL LEAP JAN2022 when it was down to 118 for a little over $1200.  Thats 10% in 11 months and I may own the stock at 115 come January.  Not a bad year and thats just one option and I dont have to look at it or manage it for another year while I search and play other scores with other buckets.To me, buying options is more akin to gambling unless your hedging in which case, that purchase is offsetting something else because your disciplined enough to know what you want to get out of a trade before you go in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-31 15:59:50'] As a matter of principle I rarely cover a position in less than three days - anything can happen on a given day and my experience has been that generally my initial judgement was correct. If after three days the directionality persists then it is possible my initial judgement was wrong. The classic signal vs. noise issue. Do not let the noise overwhelm the signal.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-01 00:29:45'] We've all  been there.....I usually stick to a 50/50ish rule myself (as mentioned below) but more and more I am really trying to push myself to being okay with losing it all. For example, just as the GME insanity took off, I yolo'd in and was down to $30.00 the day before expiry/everything turned around. Made 1000% gains in those last hours off what I originally put in..... although I'm currently bagholding TSLA (and I'm okay with it) so its only evening things out. Point is: Only use what you can lose. If you're okay with watching it disappear, it gives you time to recover too.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 11:31:39'] Banks have been red hot. Time to see if its justified or not. Im assuming it is. Would be a put seller but a mean reversion has me worried. No play on earnings this week for me.  I could see a TLRY selling of calls but given how beaten down it is im not interested at current pps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 13:38:43'] Also good to mention that JPM will be hosting it's annual Healthcare conference on the 11th-14th. Some years it is a significant catalyst for Healthcare stock and JPM.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 12:04:27'] Question:  You list "this week" the SPY options are pricing a move of 1.3% and in the prior paragraph you state how prior weeks SPY moved more than the 1% it was priced to move.  Do you or anyone give any credence to what % move options are theoretically priced at?  Stated another way...do you make a single equity trade based on that info and if so, why and how?I find that info meaningless to my analysis and trading methodology.  Including identifying entry and exit points.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 12:25:18'] It’s quite literally the most powerful tool that can be found in the markets. It’s tell you what is priced it in the derivatives market. You can use this to set up spreads, swing trade. It is telling you where the market is expecting more buyers than sellers or visa versa.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 16:45:21'] I'm planning on putting two bull put spreads on [TSM](https://optionstrat.com/dLVYVJeCdrBv) and on [JPM](https://optionstrat.com/dLVYVJeCdrBv). Both have positive outlooks for the week, but scared for what the high yields will do for TSM.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 12:55:38'] Basically, you are playing for a large move in the stock.  If it moves big, you make money.  If it doesn't, you lose money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 13:01:36'] Straddles make money when one option gains faster than the other loses  Basically you're long volatility
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 13:02:32'] You’ll be IV crushed unless there’s a BIG move
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 17:54:29'] Congratulations, you have invented the Long Straddle! There is nothing to say that this strategy wouldn't provide excellent results at earnings. It gains when "something happens" in either direction. But the tradeoff is that your premiums add up quick. You might also look into Long Strangles, which is a Straddle but different strike prices - you get a wider range (bigger net) but the sacrifice is max gain is slightly reduced. Finally, there is a position called Short Iron Butterfly which gives you a similar payoff, but also a) has downside protection because it is comprised of spreads; and b) is a short position and sometimes being the seller is better. Check these out on Investopedia.com and study them! Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 13:08:36'] IV crush generally kills you with these plays... The underlying has to move MORE than the cost of both legs of the straddle as one leg is going to be worthless at open and the other is only going to be worth the intrinsic... For TSLA you'd need a $78 move just to break even.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 13:07:50'] If you bought just before close today, you would need a 7.7% move up or down in Tesla before you would start to make any profit with this strategy at $975 strike.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 12:56:05'] What happens if it doesn’t move much? Great numbers for q1, but bad guidance, end up where we are now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 20:12:51'] It won’t work. If you do a straddle or strangle a few weeks before earnings you can play them for a big move. With this approach the week of, you get IV crushed on both ends.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 20:45:53'] What about if instead of buying you sell?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 04:50:14'] The math is simple, if you buy the straddle as you're suggesting, then the stock needs to move further from the strike price than the total premium you paid.  I didn't look at TSLA before the close yesterday, I've had a couple positions on for a while so I didn't add anything new for earnings but lets suppose you could have gotten the 4/22 straddle and paid $70 for it.  That means you would need the stock to move below 930 or above 1070 by close tomorrow to make any money.  It looks like that is still possible but opening this morning is going to be about 1050 so you aren't there yet.  It would be near impossible for this position to be a complete loss because it would have to peg your strike at expiration, but unless it keeps moving up basically another 2% over the next 2 days you will lose money.That's the math, you are playing for a move outside of what is expected.  This would have worked very well if you had done it for NFLX earnings on Tuesday, TSLA looks like it will turn out to be a flop for this plan.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 10:06:52'] You need a lot of movement to profit off this strat. I've found it's actually better to buy a straddle/strangle ahead of time and sell right before EOD earnings to avoid volatility crush. That or pick a direction and cross your fingers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 11:56:26'] I occasionally trade long straddles, not dissimilarly to how you are describing, but in earnings season it can be a hit and miss strategy. The mechanics of the strategy are that you are betting on the stock being highly volatile. The main issue with them is that they're expensive, because ATM options are, well, expensive. So, the higher the cost of the options, the more the stock needs to move in order for you to make money.If you're a mathematical prodigy, you can try to figure out whether the IV of a specific straddle is underestimated - and that's likely to make you some money. But I, for one, struggle to believe that there are many such opportunities on the market. Sell-side derivatives traders are generally quite quick to act on any market imperfections they notice. The timing of your specific strategy is also problematic, as market makers tend to expect volatility to rise around earnings announcements; they move accordingly, making options more expensive. This adds to the amount of actual price movement you would require to make a profit.Lastly, like any long option strategy, you're going against theta - although generally if you keep the position open a few hours you're unlikely to lose a ton of money due to that. As someone else said, look into similar strategies such as long strangles, etc. as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 14:07:15'] https://www.projectfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/straddle-graph.pngLook at that picture. Hope it makes sense. You make profit if tje swing is bigger than the sum of the two premiums. Beware though IV is usually high around earnings and dividend calls. With high iv premiun goes up and youll need an even bigger swing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 16:45:53'] Its called a straddle and something like netflix is perfect for that riggt now, ya cant lose
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 18:06:33'] If the stock doesn't move much, IV plummets and the value of your option evaporates. This is classic tried tested and true method for retail traders to lose money. There are academic papers on it if you're interested.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 18:42:47'] It can work.  In futures, you can sell a future and buy 2 calls as well
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 20:09:33'] This bet is for stock to move super crazy in either direction just like Netflix. Historically the Netflix like yesterday’s event is pretty rare and buying both sides will rarely win.  Instead if i had spare money, i would do a coin toss and bet only one side in a hope that i am right.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 03:59:27'] This is a straddle
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 07:27:45'] OP,  please read about IV crush, especially in low volatility environments unlike 2022.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 11:18:39'] Prices a week before already rise way beyond the intrinsic value. This is called IV. So it doesn’t matter if the stock goes up or down, the next day you will be destroyed either way as these prices come back to intrinsic value.
