	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 12:31:07'] No, they are not undervalued. If you think with 1 hour of research you figured what the market is missing, then I have a flying bridge to sell you.Cyclical pharmaceutical company with lots of uncertainties. Unless you understand their whole portfolio of drugs, your analysis is rubbish. Literally half to PFE revenue last year are COVID related.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 10:24:12'] Projected revenue and earnings guidance for 2023 is 61-71 billion and 3.25-3.45 eps. That would give them a fwd P/e estimate of around 12 which is still incredibly low relative to the overall pharmaceutical industry. I‚Äôm bullish heading into the next earnings report. Especially with the $ weakening overseas sales won‚Äôt be as affected. They also have the Humira generic bio similar launching soon, which brings in billions of revenue for Abbvie. The RSV vaccine getting approval would be a cherry on top
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 14:55:14'] They adjusted their Covid deal and have had a flurry of good news but stock is still dropping. Mind sharing if you‚Äôre investing?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 19:32:55'] You can discover nothing about the future of the stock market or any individual stocks by looking at this diagram. If you look at the inverse yield curve ( long term bonds have a lower yield than short term bonds) you may lessen your exposure to stocks in the next year. If the PE ratio of the entire market is lower now that it has been in the last 30 years you may want to increase your stock holdings.However, I doubt that that making such adjustments to your portfolio will really help you. It is almost impossible to correctly time the market. I know that these statements will not hold you back. They do not even hold me back.

POST_TEXT: b'The recent recommendation of the Pfizer vaccine for younger children is another major boon for Pfizer. But what must be kept in mind is that when full authorization was granted to the Pfizer vaccine in mid-August, the stock crashed due to people selling the news after buying the hype. \n\nHowever, unlike in the mid-summer, the stock has failed to gain traction during the days leading up to todays recommendation, suggesting that not as many people bought into the hype compared to during late July to early August. That being said, where do you think the Pfizer stock will go following todays news? Will it rally to its former highs or will it drop yet again?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 12:53:04'] Drop! Too much bad publicity and investigations.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 12:53:49'] Vaccines are not a major money-maker, but Pfizer has excellent EPS growth this year, excellent P/S, and the technology that went into the vaccine will be used for a wide variety of new, more profitable, treatments in the future.Will the stock care about today's news? No. Is it a good stock for a long-term investor? Yes. Is it a good stock for a swing trader? Probably. Will it go up this week? Who knows? There is no good way to time an entry point on this without days of work digging at their books.

Thoughts appreciated\n\nAlso if anyone could give options on other stocks that are similar that would be better investments. \n\nAt this point Ive said all I can say and asked as much as I could but Apparently you have to go and write 500 characters plus and then do a whole bunch of extra stuff just ask a simple question and this is the only question I want to ask but I have to fill in the extra character so I apologize in advance. \n\nLovely weather we appear to be having the economy is the economy him how are you guys doing hope you guys are well bloody bloody bloody bloody election world domination .'
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 10:27:31'] I expect Pfizer to go $40 min after earnings release.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 14:10:46'] i bought PFE about 25 years ago at 95 it did a 3 for 1 split so basicly 25 years ago i owned it at $32. im just glad i sold it back then cause its not much higher than what i bought it at then. as for gold - when the market drops, and it will - your gold stock should move up
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 11:18:19'] Gold usually goes down in a hot market like we have right now, it goes up when there is a pullback or it goes into a bull market. I have GOLD on my watch list. I‚Äôm waiting for news of when interest rates are going to go up because I think that will lead to a market pull back this causing GOLD to go up. So it may go down more but it will go back up sooner or later. We can‚Äôt keep printing free money forever and the pullback is coming....just a matter of when. Not financial advice, just stating my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 12:27:52'] Gold is not very volatile and usually goes down in market melt-ups. Inflationary environment and market downturns are when it will rise. I'd personally keep holding my gold stocks

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 16:13:21'] Buffet exited completely of GOLD in Q4 witch was disclosed couple days ago on Feb 16th theres where you pain comes from, also PFE, he sold all that too..doesnt mean you need to sell aswell, but yeah, it be downhill short term..

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 08:16:13'] I can't really speak to Gold, but regarding PFE... I've been in since Nov and averaged down again and again. Painful. On another thread I suggested I might come off as a shill, but the reason I've stayed in is that it has a decent yield on the dividend (.39 / qtr / \~4.5% annually) and now at the current price, you have an opportunity for significant > SP movement. Price has behaved differently last few days, which is to say good. Don't know if MM manipulation behind us (it never really is) but at least price was free to move up.  When they post Q1 results it's very likely price will move up again as the benefit of a full qtr of vaccine rev/profit will reveal itself. And not being a one-trick pony, PFE has much to crow about of late, e.g., cancer drug and FDA approval 3/3. And. by the way, the PFE vaccine is hands-down the best of the vaccines with gov'ts worldwide buying in... Brazil may be next. I like the where it's going.

So i made some research about it, and i think i will bought their stock but also need your opinion about it, im new in this so every help will be huge.\n\nPfizer Inc. discovers, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, and sells biopharmaceutical products worldwide. It offers medicines and vaccines in various therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular metabolic and pain under the Eliquis, Chantix/Champix, and Premarin family brands; biologics, small molecules, immunotherapies, and biosimilars under the Ibrance, Xtandi, Sutent, Inlyta, Retacrit, Lorbrena, and Braftovi brands; and sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines under the Sulperazon, Medrol, Zithromax, Vfend, and Panzyga brands. More about them [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PFE/profile?p=PFE). \n\nLittle about their finance: \n\nMarket Cap **202.487B** \n\nForward Dividend & Yield :**1.56 (4.30%)'
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 05:27:29'] Company is so big, they got 2 new drugs coming out this month. Stock does not move like other pharmaceutical.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 05:41:12'] PFE is too big, so that only vaccine can't move it a lot. Also the dividend will be a bit reduced later in the year because of the spin-off that already happened.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 06:03:35'] This is just throwing money away
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 10:26:12'] OP DD is lacking, but the vaccine *may* be bigger than people expect (currently common sentiment is it‚Äôs worth nothing and can‚Äôt move the stock, as can be seen by other comments on this thread). In early February, projected 2020 revenues from the vaccine were $15B, with 20-30% margins and half of profits shared w Biontec. ~$2B is over 20% of their 2020 income. Since that projection, 500M+ orders came in, so at minimum revenues will be $20B. If a booster is required, it will be their most profitable treatment (currently pneumovax).The viatris spinoff may seem like a negative at face value, but most would view it as a positive (after all, this is why Pfizer chose to spin them off). Viatris only holds off patent drugs, and was decreasing profits every year. Having shed the slowly dying Viatris, the expectation is for Pfizer to grow. W 80+ drugs in pipeline, 30+ phase 3 or just past phase 3, and covax goodwill likely improving their ability to raise drug prices, I like the odds.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-04 09:58:19'] Reading that first paragraph was wild so i bailed out but all i know is pfizer been trading sideways all year i will take my money elsewhere good sir
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-05 00:08:08'] You can see in the chart in Nov/Dec when the vaccine came out and the stock went up, then when people realized it isn't a big cash cow it went back down.Anything like this that is in the news is already going to be priced into a stock. Investing is harder than that.That said, they're a big healthy company so it is not unreasonable for a long-term investment.üëº

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 06:46:09'] Nah...  I think we will be range bound/sideways from here for a while.  I doubt we make new lows unless unemployment starts rising.  We won't make new highs until the macroeconomic situations improve (inflation subsiding, FED cutting, economy growing at a higher rate).  This will probably a long way off though. The recent market catalysts have not been as bad a feared. Markets priced in worse.  Many of the speculative bubble stocks and tech have basically crashed.  You look at some of these charts and all the 2020-2022 gains are gone. Now there are fair buying opportunities in a lot of these beaten down names and money has been rotating into them. Catalysts:Small FED rate hikesSlowing but not contracting economy Slowing inflationLow unemploymentEarnings falling but not as much as feared. Bond market still pricing in rate pauses and cuts in the medium term 12-24 months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 05:01:45'] Stock market goes up = inflationary and works against tightening financial conditions.I think JPow must be pissed by now that bulls still don‚Äôt understand the concept of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fight the FED‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 00:13:17'] It's ridiculous and hypocritical that all these narcissistic dweebs took advantage of the Robinhood platform to invest in crypto, Dogecoin, and meme stocks and then got all salty when they halted trading which is exactly what all these crypto platforms do constantly, many of which are going bankrupt before Robinhood. Inexperienced retail traders bite the hand that feeds. Bear in mind that we can all thank these absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing from the Fed as a reason crypto and the stock market exploded after March of 2020 in the first place. The stock market literally doubled in less than 2 years. It would be a complete policy error mistake to not scale that delusional overvalued BS down a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 11:51:09'] You can thank the republicans for giving a massive tax break that went into effect right before a global pandemic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 09:04:07'] The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn‚Äôt fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don‚Äôt realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.       This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-22 13:32:55'] My beaten up portfolio is now pretty much almost dead, my hard earned money gone. Someone told me earlier that retail investors only exist to get r\*ped by algos and major players. I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started "investing." The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  edit: downvoted for being a loser i already know

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 10:22:03'] Apple was overbought by people who wanted to get into the market with no trading experience.New traders buy companies they know.Apple, Tesla, Google, Facebook and Amazon were all perceived as "safe" stocks so, as rhe market started to tank, scared money ran from new/growth companies to these bigger companies (as is typical in a rosk off event).Now the reality of earnings and sales projections is apparent. People are learning there are no "safe" stocks.When these stocks tank it will be a sign of retail trader capitulation which is a requisite for an overall capitulation in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 07:18:08'] The Apple business model doesn't justify forward PE of almost 25.  It's growth just isn't there like it used to be.  Perhaps the price is resetting down to a new normal befitting a more stable grower.  If this is the case the price is going down until the forward PE is in the teens.

The Fed doesn‚Äôt give a shit about an incoming recession and has all but guaranteed it will happen in order to return inflation to a normal level. They‚Äôve said so themselves. The implications of the increase interest hikes won‚Äôt come into full effect for months still. If you have unlimited investment money, keep DCAing on the way down.

Apple stock will face continual resistance along with all other stocks from  the macro headwinds of the current bear market.We still don't know if the bear market is short or long term. It may be over in a few months or maybe a few years. How long can you afford to wait? Selling early could lead to permanent wealth destruction.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 10:42:22'] Nothing is wrong with Apple except they realize that people don‚Äôt want to shell out a grand for a new phone. There‚Äôs a recession coming (it‚Äôs been in all the papers) so what do people do? Hold off on big ticket items especially if they can use what they need for another year. Apple saw the recession ( why do you think they didn‚Äôt raise prices ) and decided to play it cool (why do you think they‚Äôve lowered the volume for phones from OEM‚Äôs ) and now it‚Äôs just the markets reevaluating a recession priced Apple.  Wait for your price.  ( $125?  ) maybe
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 11:17:08'] Interest rates are going up.  People will have less money to spend.  Profits will go down.  But at some point interest rates will go down.  Apple has great products and services.  I like to buy when prices are low.  Most be willing and able to hold and wait.

However, NDX100 just needs to close with a 1% decline next week and it confirms it too. If next week is red, next 12 month projection is confirmed at most a 53% decline, at least a 33% decline. I wont predict a crash, because a 30% decline in a week is a crash.On the flip side this could be a bottom lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 16:22:49'] Yes, price traded lower today across all the majors; however, price still remains within the micro-trend's bullish consolidation zone. I provided a brief technical analysis on [SPY](https://stocktwits.com/PrecisionSwingTrader/message/498279743) and [QQQ](https://stocktwits.com/PrecisionSwingTrader/message/498292941) heading into the week; in short, nothing that occurred today impacted this analysis -- and in terms of upside potential -- could even be viewed as a positive. That said, even if this bullish consolidation does breakout to the upside, it will be limited due to so much resistance over head.

POST_TEXT: b"Hope this is the right place to post. I'm a fairly new investor having started my Roth IRA a little over a year ago.  I woke up this morning and found that my account is several thousand dollars higher Fridays closing, but Im trying to stem my excitement until I figure out exactly what is happening. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the first time any of my holdings are being bought out by another company. Pfizer is buying out at $48/share and todays closing price was $46.44 (up 56.94%). Ive tried doing some research but Im not exactly sure what will happen. If I do nothing, will my shares disappear and my account credited at $48/share? That would mean a guaranteed 3.3% growth in that holding between now and the buyout. Is it worth selling now and reinvesting into a different holding that might yield better than 3.3%? Is there any chance the buyout might not go through and ARRY crashes back down to where it was prior to the buyout announcement?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time."

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 18:23:00'] Stock market still has far too many companies trading above prices that their earnings dont actually support. I will share this that I‚Äôve learned about the stock market during bear markets and high inflation. The stock market has never found a bottom until the rate of inflation and PE of the S&P 500 equaled to less than 20 when combined. It‚Äôs called the rule of 20 you can look it up. The average is around 18.2. Also, in 2021 the S&P doubled from its pandemic bottom, marking the fastest bull market rally since WWII. You don‚Äôt just brush off that kind of irrationality.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 19:35:44'] As usual everyone isn‚Äôt looking at the big picture. Todays sell off is simply the beginning of the downturns in the markets. F Amazon. F Apple. F the fangs and look out below. Stubborn inflation will result in all stocks being downgraded until we have a 12 PE ( or worse ) and interest rates about 5 percent ( or higher) and people start getting laid off. Anecdotal stories of the housing markets are JUST starting! I suspect the October GDP will not only show another downturn but according to the third time in a row it represents a depression. There are too many people betting on a pivot, a turnaround, a sudden miracle where the markets will suddenly go up. Not happening. The VIX had to hit higher than 40 ( doesn‚Äôt mean a capitulation) and can go higher still. Higher interest rates will send NASDAQ below 10k to 9500, a 40% decline ( not unusual for these stocks) and an SPX below 3400.  This is a bear market. Cash is king. Listening to those long term pundits who won‚Äôt care about the pain you are suffering only means they want your assets so they can profit on your portfolios. But then again, what‚Äôs going on may be too late for most of us. After all, new investors ( all you kids 40 years old and younger ) all believe in buying the dips. After your lessons this year and next you can learn what it means to be ‚Äúprudent‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:24:30'] The only reason this went up was interest rates went down. Second day of ‚Äúfalling rates‚Äù if you count a few basis points as falling. The middle day of profit taking showed me how easy this market will go down as the hucksters took the profits of the schmucks who think wow, this market is great it‚Äôs going up, hell I‚Äôll buy!!!  There is no long term growth. Disney showed us tonight. So has Affirm. The buy now pay later routine was the same deal as the housing market which was the same deal of 5% down in five days for a margin account in 1929. The clock is ticking. Still to many kids with too much money trying to make a quick buck day-trading, options playing, and trying Forex. I don‚Äôt know where or when the time bomb is going off but trust me, in every bear market there is always some stupid capitulation event.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 17:44:13'] Decent pullback today (by volatile, 2022 standards) on near-average volume across the majors. Both SPY & QQQ remained within what could become an inside bar if the pattern matures -- more so than a bull flag at this point.    SPY's price action was more interesting by comparison due to its pullback coming close to the minor support trendline -- 397.90 will need to hold tomorrow for the bulls    QQQ has more room below at 279.97 for the bulls to hold its inside bar. Regardless, the bulls do not have much room to the upside on either SPY or QQQ, so any breakout will likely be limited, if one comes at all.    IWM pulled back a full percentage point more than SPY. Often a 'leading indicator,' the IWM fell to nearly close below what still may be an inside bar pattern, but given today's price action, more likely suggests a break to the downside. Bulls need 180.70 to hold.

Nevertheless, that result is well-below the $3.22 billion reported in the same period last year. The stock was up about 2 percent in premarket trading.> **Ford Motor** - shares tumbled nearly 2 percent ahead of the bell after the automaker reported earnings that were below Wall Street's estimates, citing fewer vehicles sales in North America due to the rollout of the F-150 pickup truck and continued to lose money in South America and Europe.> **Bristol-Myers Squibb** - shares rose nearly 2 percent in premarket trading after reporting quarterly profits of 71 cents per share, well-above analysts' forecast of 51 cents. The pharmaceutical giant also reported revenue of $4.04 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of $3.80 billion.> **Merck** - beat Wall Street's estimates after posting adjusted quarterly profits of 85 cent per share on revenue of $9.4 billion, sending the stock up more than 4.5 percent in premarket trading. Analysts expected the company to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $9.1 billion.> **Pfizer**'s - stock traded slightly lower ahead of the bell after lowering its 2015 guidance for earnings per share and revenue. The pharmaceutical giant also reported quarterly adjusted profits of 51 cent per share on revenue of $10.86 billion, both of which beat Wall Street estimates.> **United Parcel Service** - shares rose more than 1 percent after reporting quarterly profits of $1.12 per share, slightly above analysts' forecasts. Nevertheless, the package delivery giant also posted quarterly revenues of $13.97 billion, below Wall Street's forecast of $14.27 billion.> **Coach** - reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 36 cents per share, slightly above consensus estimates. Its revenue, however, came in at $929 million, below Wall Street's forecast of $950 million. The handbag maker's stock plunged about 7 percent ahead of the bell.> **Aetna** - reported quarterly operating earnings of $2.39 per share, well-above analysts' forecast of $1.95, citing increasing membership since the end of 2014. The U.S.' third-largest health insurer also increased its full-year guidance.> **Apple** - shares rose more than 2 percent ahead of the opening bell as the tech giant carried over its acquired momentum from Monday's earnings report. The company reported quarterly earnings per share of $2.33 on revenue of $56.08 billion, both above consensus estimates. Apple also said it would expand its capital return program to $200 billion from $130 billion.

	COMMENT: ['2014-05-05 06:53:35']  Pfizer‚ÄìThe drug maker earned 57 cents per share, excluding certain items, for the first quarter, two cents above estimates. Revenue, though, fell short of consensus, as sales weakened in its two largest units. Separately, the company may need to raise its $106 billion offer for AstraZeneca by up to 10 percent, according to analysts. Pfizer's bids for the British drug maker have already been rejected three times.Occidental Petroleum‚ÄìThe energy producer beat estimates by five cents with first quarter profit of $1.75 per share, excluding certain items, helped by the company's oil and gas operations.Tyson Foods‚ÄìThe food producer earned 60 cents per share for the fiscal second quarter, missing estimates by three cents. Revenue, however, did exceed expectations, and the company said it is pleased with the quarter despite challenges posed by factors such as the severe winter weather.Zumiez‚ÄìPiper Jaffray upgraded the retailer's stock to "overweight" from "neutral", based on factors such as the success of the company's streetwear-inspired fashions as well as cost cuts.Salesforce.com‚Äì Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to "buy" from "hold", saying it was now more comfortable with the company's handling of various ongoing issues. It also said valuation is reasonable following a 20 percent drop from the stock's highs.Apple‚ÄìThe iPhone maker won a nearly $120 million award from Samsung in the month-long patent trial in California. However, that jury award was much less than Apple had sought.JPMorgan Chase‚ÄìThe mega bank said its exposure to Russia amounted to $4.7 billion as of March 31, and that it is closely monitoring the events related to Ukraine and the impact of sanctions by the U.S. and other countries.Microsoft‚ÄìThe software giant's biggest shareholder is now former CEO Steve Ballmer, rather than founder Bill Gates. An SEC filing shows that Gates sold 4.6 million Microsoft shares last week, dropping him to second behind Ballmer. Gates has been selling Microsoft shares regularly to fund his charitable foundation.Sotheby's‚ÄîSotheby's has successfully held off an effort by Third Point's Daniel Loeb to remove the auction house's shareholder rights plan. A judge ruled Friday that he would not throw out Sotheby's "poison pill", which limits the amount activist investors can buy to 10 percent.General Motors‚ÄîGM is recalling nearly 52,000 SUV models because of a possibly inaccurate fuel gauge.Electronic Arts‚ÄìThe game maker is reportedly close to an agreement with Comcast to stream games through Comcast's advanced X1 cable delivery system, according to Reuters.Oracle‚Äì Bernstein upgraded Oracle to "outperform" from "neutral."Chipotle Mexican Grill‚ÄìRaymond James upgraded the restaurant chain's stock to "outperform" from "market perform."

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 19:16:43'] The micro-trend's bullish consolidation on both the SPY & QQQ pierced, and more importantly closed, above their flag's celing, but much more so on the SPY than the QQQ.  As a result, the SPY is considerably closer to major resistance than the QQQ (e.g. $8 on the QQQ vs. only $2 on the SPY).  Of note, SPY did close above its 200 DMA, whereas QQQ remains below its 200 DMA.The fact today's move occurred on comparatively high volume (144M & 75M respectively) suggests institution's participated, as opposed to only retail investors.Critical for the bulls will be a SPY close above at least 407.68 and a QQQ close above at least 293.47.  Regardless, with so many resistance levels above current price, upside will stil likely be limited in both price and duration.

Comcast was helped by a surge in ad revenue at NBC, thanks to the Winter Olympics and Jimmy Fallon taking over as host of "The Tonight Show.">Allergan‚ÄìThe maker of Botox and eye care products is now a takeover target of Pershing Square's Bill Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Valeant is offering $48.30 per share in cash, plus 0.83 Valeant shares, for each share of Allergan. The latter's shareholders would own 43 percent of the combined company.>Travelers‚ÄìThe insurer earned $2.95 per share for the first quarter, beating estimates of $2.16. Revenue was essentially in line, and the company also announced a 10 percent dividend increase.>United Technologies‚ÄìThe aerospace manufacturer reported first quarter profit of $1.32 per share, excluding certain items, beating estimates by five cents. The company's results were aided by sales increases in all five of its operating units.>Lexmark‚ÄìThe maker of computer printers beat estimates by five cents with first quarter profit of 92 cents per share, excluding certain items, with revenues also above consensus. Lexmark's results were boosted by increases in revenue for software and printing services.>Harley-Davidson‚ÄìThe motorcycle maker earned $1.21 per share for the first quarter, 13 cents above estimates, with revenue scoring a strong beat as well. The company is maintaining its prior full-year forecast of up to 284,000 motorcycles sold for 2014.>Xerox‚ÄìThe company beat estimates by three cents with first quarter profit of 27 cents per share, excluding certain items, but gave a current quarter forecast below consensus. Xerox is being impacted by declining sales in printing, as well as slower growth in services.>Netflix‚ÄìThe steaming video service reported first quarter profit of 86 cents per share, three cents above estimates. The company also announced it would increase its monthly membership fee by $1 to $2 per month for new subscribers later this quarter, and projected current quarter profit above street estimates.

	COMMENT: ['2016-02-02 06:00:50'] good morning traders! happy groundhog day! here are your early movers on this tuesday-> **Pfizer** ‚Äî The drug maker earned an adjusted 53 cents per share for the fourth quarter, 1 cent above estimates, with revenue also beating forecasts. Pfizer was helped by demand for its pneumonia vaccine and its recent acquisition of Hospira. However, Pfizer did forecast full-year 2016 earnings that are slightly below Street forecasts.> **Michael Kors** ‚Äî The luxury goods maker beat estimates by 13 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.59 per share, and revenue also came in above forecasts. Kors was helped by particular strength in accessories and footwear.> **Archer Daniels Midland** ‚Äî The grain processor missed estimates by 3 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 61 cents per share, and revenue was well short of forecasts. The company cited adverse market conditions that impacted many of its businesses, and said headwinds were likely to persist. However, ADM did raise its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share from 28 cents.> **Dow Chemical** ‚Äî The chemical maker, which is in the midst of merging with DuPont, earned an adjusted 93 cents per share for the fourth quarter, 23 cents above estimates, and revenue also was above forecasts.> **Sirius XM** ‚Äî The satellite radio operator matched estimates with earnings of 3 cents per share for its latest quarter, and revenue was slightly above forecasts. However, Sirius did predict a slowing in subscriber growth this year to its slowest since at least 2013.> **Alphabet** ‚Äî The Google parent reported adjusted quarterly profit of $8.67 per share, 57 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating forecasts. The core Google internet business saw operating income rise 23 percent for the year compared to 2014, and an after-hours rally propelled Alphabet past Apple as the world's most valuable company.> **Mattel** ‚Äî The toy maker beat estimates by 6 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 67 cents per share, and revenue also came in above analyst forecasts. Mattel's bottom line was helped by its first quarterly sales increase in more than two years, helped by renewed popularity for Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys.> **Fitbit** ‚Äî Oppenheimer initiated coverage on the wearable fitness products maker with an "outperform" rating, noting Fitbit's prominent position in a market Oppenheimer feels will grow rapidly in the future.> **Twitter** ‚Äî Twitter was downgraded to "sell" from "hold" at Stifel, which said Twitter has never developed a sustainable business model and may never achieve that goal.> **Mallinckrodt** ‚Äî The biopharmaceutical company reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.09 per share, well above estimates of $1.78. Revenue also beat forecasts, and the company raised its fiscal 2016 earnings guidance above current Street consensus. Mallinckrodt's upbeat performance was led by a 45 percent sales increase for its "Exceptional Specialty Brands" segment.> **Aflac** ‚Äî Aflac reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.56 per share, 9 cents above estimates, while revenue came in ahead of estimates as well. The insurance company was able to beat forecasts despite the negative impact of a weaker yen, which hurt Aflac's prominent Japan business.> **Anadarko Petroleum** ‚Äî The energy producer lost an adjusted 57 cents per share, smaller than the consensus estimate of a $1.08 loss. Revenue was very slightly below forecasts as the company dealt with lower oil prices, and it said it expected to cut 2016 capital spending nearly in half compared to 2015.> **Rent-A-Center** ‚Äî The company beat estimates by 2 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 54 cents per share, though revenue missed the mark. The rent-to-own company also predicted a 2016 same-store sales decline of one to 3 percent.> **BP** ‚Äî BP reported its biggest annual loss in more than 20 years for 2015, and plans to cut 7,000 jobs by 2017. That represents about 9 percent of its workforce, as it tries to deal with the ongoing decline in oil prices.> **Sanofi** ‚Äî Sanofi launched an effort to develop a vaccine to combat the fast-growing Zika virus. The project will be undertaken by the drug maker's Sanofi Pasteur vaccines division.> **UBS** ‚Äî The bank reported earnings that topped analyst forecasts, but the shares are under pressure after the bank reported an unexpected outflow from its wealth management business.> **Take-Two Interactive** ‚Äî The video game maker was hit with a copyright lawsuit by tattoo designer Solid Oak Sketches. The dispute involves the use of tattoos that are worn by NBA stars LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in Take-Two's NBA 2K16 video game.> **21st Century Fox** ‚Äî Fox is aiming for $250 million in cost cuts over the next fiscal year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The paper said the cuts would come primarily through buyouts, with workers in the TV and movie studio groups notified on Monday.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 15:39:18'] The one that gives me the most dread is the long, soul-sucking slog between 1966 and 1982 ‚Äî in other words, the 1970s. The stock market went up and down and up and down, but in the end went absolutely nowhere for 16 years.So there's a high probability in my mind that the market at best is going to be kind of flat for 10 years, sort of like this ‚Äò66 to ‚Äò82 time period.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 18:10:56'] I was thinking the markets look like they want to go up but there‚Äôs too much money realizing we are heading for a recession. That‚Äôs why the bond market rates are going down. Not because of future lower rates but because a recession is coming. Sooner than we think. Imagine TWO (2) too rate hikes of .50 in December AND in the first week of February.  Wait for the markets to try and wrap their heads around that idea.  I‚Äôm starting to DCA on investments I like.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 17:53:39'] Why not? Risk free short term is 3.5 -4.5%. INTC has potential issues and is in a sector that had a large decline. It makes sense it would have a 5% yield. It should probably have a higher one to be enticing unless you are betting on the turn around.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 19:17:54'] The micro-trend's bullish consolidation on both the SPY & QQQ pierced, and more importantly closed, above their flag's celing, but much more so on the SPY than the QQQ.  As a result, the SPY is considerably closer to major resistance than the QQQ (e.g. $8 on the QQQ vs. only $2 on the SPY).  Of note, SPY did close above its 200 DMA, whereas QQQ remains below its 200 DMA.The fact today's move occurred on comparatively high volume (144M & 75M respectively) suggests institution's participated, as opposed to only retail investors.Critical for the bulls will be a SPY close above at least 407.68 and a QQQ close above at least 293.47.  Regardless, with so many resistance levels above current price, upside will stil likely be limited in both price and duration.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-28 09:04:50'] Every stock is a good choice and every stock is a bad choice.What makes the difference between good and bad is you. You need to spend time researching anything and everything you actually purchase.Many brokers give demo accounts and I strongly recommend using it to actually test and see what works well without risking real money.The one thing that I will say that will help you as you develop your trading and begin to really want to explore a live market more thoroughly is look for stocks that provide dividends. You want to be able to focus on when those dividends are paid. Win a stock pays a dividend may or may not be relevant to you based upon what you're trying to achieve with your own trading and investing.Typically speaking, stocks that pay quarterly will pay more each quarter than the stock that pays once a month but that is relative to the time frame of the actual payment. Also each stock pays a different rate compared to another so finding the right ones with the right risk appropriate your situation requires specific levels of research and time to make sure you are thrilled about your research.As far as the amount you purchase, there are really two simple rules that apply to that,1. Never risk more than you can afford to lose,2. Always be willing to lose everything you risk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 16:12:13'] My advice is dont learn on internet strangers to recommend what stocks to buy. Do your own research and due diligence. Read up on how to judge fundamentals, technical analysis, read charts, and trading strategies. If researching individual companies is too much then research index funds like SPY and QQQ, they are vested across the entire market. You need $ to make $, so I would not start with stocks, invest in yourself first.

DuPont said its profit margins improved in five of seven businesses, but it also noted it expects sluggish fourth quarter growth in the global economy, and further currency headwinds that will affect its agriculture business.> **Pfizer**‚ÄîThe pharmaceutical company beat estimates by 2 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 57 cents per share, with revenue also above forecasts. Pfizer also narrowed its earnings forecast for the full year, as it evaluates the impact of increased generic competition and its efforts to develop new treatments.> **Aetna**‚ÄîThe insurance company reported third quarter profit of $1.67 per share, above estimates of $1.58, with revenue exceeding estimates as well. Aetna also raised its 2014 earnings forecast, amid further gains in its government-related business.> **Coach**‚ÄîThe luxury goods maker beat Street forecasts by 8 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 53 cents per share, and revenue was also above forecasts. Coach's results were helped by growth in international sales.> **Whirlpool**‚ÄîThe appliance maker missed estimates by 9 cents with an adjusted third quarter profit of $3.04 per share, though revenue was essentially in line. Whirlpool maintained that its underlying fundamentals are strong, and that it will unveil details of its strategy to increase shareholder value in December.> **AutoNation**‚ÄîThe auto retailer reported adjusted third quarter profit of 90 cents per share, 4 cents above estimates, and sales also beat analyst forecasts. The bottom line beat came amid expanding profits on used car sales.> **Spirit Airlines**‚ÄîThe airline earned an adjusted $1.01 per share for the third quarter, 3 cents above estimates, although revenue was short of forecasts.

The company also raised its full-year forecast, as it sees an increase in the number of customer visits to its labs.> **Cummins**‚ÄîThe truck engine maker reported third quarter profit of $2.32 per share, 4 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating analyst forecasts. Stronger demand in North America, Europe, and China helped offset weakness in the Brazilian market.> **Sanofi**‚ÄîThe French drug maker warned that price competition will hurt its diabetes treatment business in 2015, though the drug maker is sticking to its 2014 forecast.> **T-Mobile US**‚ÄîThe wireless services provider lost 12 cents per share for its latest quarter, compared to analyst forecasts of a 1 cent per share profit. T-Mobile did post record subscriber growth for the quarter.> **Eli Lilly**‚ÄîThe drug maker and Japanese partner Takeda saw a judge slash a $9 billion damage award to $36.8 million.

Amgen's results were boosted by higher sales of its newer drugs, and it raised its full-year forecast in the wake of those results.> **Buffalo Wild Wings**‚ÄîThe company beat estimates by 7 cents with quarterly profit of $1.14 per share, with the restaurant chain chalking up improved same-store sales as well as adding new locations.> **Crocs**‚ÄîCrocs earned 30 cents per share on an adjusted basis for its latest quarter, compared to estimates of 14 cents, and revenue was above Street forecasts as well. However, the shoe retailer also projected current quarter revenue below analyst estimates,> **Regal Entertainment**‚ÄîRegal is exploring various strategic options, including a possible sale, and has hired Morgan Stanley to assist.

POST_TEXT: b'Shares of the major pharmaceutical companies behind the Covid-19 vaccines decreased Monday due to a variety of pressure points.\n\nNumbers: The declines on Monday included: 0.72% for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), 0.86% for Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), 2.70% for AstraZeneca (Nasdaq: AZN), 4.95% for Moderna (Nasdaq: MRN), 6.90% for Novavax (Nasdaq: NVAX), and 7.91% for BioNTech (Nasdaq: BNTZ).\n\nBigger Picture: The likely culprit for Mondays decline was due to Singapore reporting its highest Covid-19 cases since last April. Most of the population is vaccinated, so there may not be as many hospitalizations. The country uses the same vaccines that are available in the U.S.\n\nPotential Factor: On Sunday, the CEO of Pfizer said on ABC News that normal life will return in a year.

Moderna has blown up over the past couple of trading days, almost hitting its 52 week high and now sitting at $101.20.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-23 17:04:12'] AZN and PFE are different than Moderna.  AZN and PFE are big pharmas that have a lot more going for them than the COVID vaccine.  That's why their prices are not as volatile (for better or for worse) when compared to smaller/biotech companies like Moderna.Their prices will increase, but I wouldn't expect a rapid jump like Moderna's.

Much more upside in Moderna with their mRNA platform and  provides validity to the rest of their pipeline.

Weekly unemployment claims showed lowest level since 1969 with 184k claims vs 220k expected.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the risks of Omicron infections, with mixed news about the severity of illness and its response to vaccines. Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant. However, reports continue to suggest the severity of the disease is less than originally feared and new early lab results from Pfizer (PFE) showed a third booster shot neutralizes the variant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/o'

The DOW and S&P 500 each hit a record-high intraday, led by energy and financial stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 0.8% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.84%, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.41% up.\n\nYesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) is experiencing supply chain issues that could result in only half of the estimated vaccines entering distribution.

An apparent dispute between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve also weighed on the minds of market participants.\n\nIn Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said during a press conference that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-KY) agreed to pick back up stimulus negotiations. However, given the tenuous political situation surrounding the presidential election and the gridlock that exists in the Senate (majority for the Senate is still undecided), it is highly unlikely that any form of stimulus is passed. For months, Congress and the White House went back and forth regarding stimulus but were unable to come to an agreement. In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that '

He has been defying the wishes of his President and refusing to pass a stimulus bill from the House.  He is still Senate Majority leader so he has the power to block any bills.  So I believe he will continue to do so until that power is taken away from him.

Later on we got another loan with near zero interest  we  have to pay back way after 2021.i think this method is way better for economic recovery since people tend to spend all that money with the combined  reduction of taxes.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 18:31:16'] Watch for the price action at 16 000$ support.If the price bounces from the support, it will be possible to open a short term long positions with the profit targets at 16 500$ and 17 000$. For buying, it will be better to use the exact reversal setups in the 15m, 30m, and 1H timeframes.If the price breaks the support and moves below SMA50, it will be a¬†bearish¬†signal. If the¬†daily chart¬†gives us a reversal setup, we should be ready to see a downward movement toward 14 000$ support.If we look at the 4H chart,¬†RSI¬†and¬†MACD¬†histogram are¬†bearish¬†and support a further downward movement. Probably¬†MACD¬†lines will give us a solid trend reversal signal based on a¬†bearish¬†divergence.

Optimism that an effective coronavirus vaccine could roll out relatively soon is counterbalancing the surging infection rates, with health officials warning about holiday travel.\n\nThe positive vaccine news keep coming.

Volume nearly twice that of second place NIO, with Citron writing a rather weak hit piece that cut the legs out from an early rally... on top of being the most widely hyped stock on Reddit and quite possibly the stock which has the best potential to go from $10 to $100 over its first year of public trading. Either you're completely clueless as to what actually happened in the marketplace, or you're intentionally dismissive due to the meme-factor this stock reached over its past two-week run up.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-11 06:08:11'] What does that mean "with the vaccine several months off"? PFE vaccine is getting distributed this weekend and used on Monday. Moderna is getting approved next week. None of these things are several months off and will occur this month. Sure it's not to the general public, but it is the light at the end of the tunnel that people havent seen before. They will still have a great impact against the virus, especially with healthcare workers getting it first. If you actually invest, then the short-term bearish attitude is meaningless.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-11 10:45:38'] After reading more comments, it's been a long year for some, short year for others, one not likely forgotten. Still, what normally happens in Dec is that there are a lot of financial planners who suggest to clients to sell looser's, take those losses (tax harvesting), lock in gains, etc. So, much of that happens before the holidays when the advisors go onto their holiday. So now is when, short of exceptional NEW news, normal selling occurs. And selling begets more selling, hence a softer market, which creates a cascading effect. If you must buy, buy the best quality.The investing strategies everyone is mentioning is personal situations, kind of different than it seems the original intent of the OP. I for one, who for the last 30 years have had piling up of capital gains losses, am able to wipe them out with trades in 2020. So swing trading has been my savior, hundreds of thousand of $$$ with no taxes due. There are likely many traders like me. So even now, I'll dump the looser's to clear the decks for the next winners.
