	COMMENT: ['2022-03-20 00:30:01'] **Last year I decided I want to short GM based purely on emotion and for personal revengeful reasons.**I had no business taking this trade, as it was not in a bearish trend at the time, nor did anything indicate they would take a major fall I was hoping for.I put my $1000 up anyways and decided to lay down several out of the money put contracts far out - 6 month expiration to expire in December last year.**After taking some nibbles at puts, I eventually risked my entire account - the whole $1000. Then a few days later (to my advantage) the news hit - our economy was starting to tangle and take on the news of supply chain disruptions - notably the semiconductor shortage became a more frequent topic of concern. This sparked my interest in knowing this will be a game changer for domestic car manufacturer production.**While the news continued to roll out worse and worse each day, my contracts soared almost 700% in just a short few weeks and I decided to take profit.**My account was now at $6000 give or take. And it just kept on going from there and I slowly started closing multiple contracts several days in a row.**It was at this point in September GM started to rise again but the semiconductor shortage and supply chains were actually getting worse by the min - although your president was telling you otherwise. Citing the economy was doing so good! Remember?**Well I saw right through all of this shit and decided to pick up a new batch of puts on GM with a further out expiration (that being June this year).**After being "lucky" and turning my 1k profit into 6k, I decided to only risk about 25% of my account to further my bearish stance on GM, and continued this risk management from that day forward - dabbling into other trades as well.**Price went against me for several months while GM printed a fake rally despite of the fact we were in a downfall and supply chains just continued to get pummeled.**I averaged into my GM trades even more the further price rallied.**I sat on those contracts for several months in a -40% (sometimes even -80%) loss and waited on GM to fall again.**And they did - just recently where I have fully closed them for **even more** profit.**I also documented every bit of this journey in my Discord in the #gm-yolo-headquarters channel.**

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-19 21:55:07'] This is an old gamblimg strategy. And a good one. Ypu gp to the casino with 1000. No matter how "lucky"pr how good a bet you never bet above half.  Any time you double your money half goes back in your pocket and absolutely doesnt come back out. That other half is indeed "free". If you double it...half comes put. Another strat is that half your winnings go in your pocket and dont come out. Have 100..win 20..10 goes in.  On bad nights you still lose your 1000. But on insane nights you dont win 50k and leave broke...you leave with at least 25k or much more. You bring home say 10k. You go back next day with 5 k. You do NOT increase your pool to 5k that night.Tge casinos rely on you doing the opposite of this "hey i won 10k..ill raide my pool to 5 and put the rest away. An hour later..'well i lost 5 but its free money ill whip out another 2500"Wjen gambling your ONLY real power is over your bet. Anything else is delusion

Please at least sell your options and switch to stock and start selling covered calls, you're not understanding how quickly a stock like this can drop down to $40 before your expiry and you could lose everything. If it happens it will hit you like a ton of bricks -> $55 "eh it'll go back up by march, $50, "come on, it'll get back to 50, at least" -> $45 "I don't even care anymore, better to risk it than lock in the loss."

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-15 19:29:49'] Might want to check rev share with Bio N Tech. I did not realize it at first, but that's where the market cap growth has been for the Pfizer vax (I think...). PFE is already a big company and it has been pretty steady. It's a great company but I'd be stunned if it hit 60 this year.  I have been debating rolling some of my MRNA proceeds into PFE, but I have lower/safer expectations.  I want to find the rev share arrangement first and see how it extends to other mRNA-based products. There is a massive opportunity for vaccines to use this platform on general.

Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. \n\nWhile BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 11:20:49'] 38C in a month should make money, however I have a fear that the health sector is about to either stall or take a steaming shit on everyone's portfolio.Corona was about the only thing making hospitals and drug companies money for the last couple months and a bunch of jobs were lost which will take a long time to recover, which means slower access to shit. Now the public has just said through rioting that there are no more fucks to be given bout the 'rona as all fucks are given towards police brutality. XLV took a dip but was right back up to ATH before one could blink. It out performed everything except recently tech overtook it. No more 'rona checks are coming, Fed isn't handing anyone money after the riots and now the news doesn't give a shit about COVID as it's protest/riot coverage 24/7, and come July those extra unemployment checks stop. People will no longer have health coverage nor money to pay for shit. The Fed is now less focused on Corona and the pressure on the FDA to get it done disappears and they go back to their normal, glaciers move faster, speed. Plus R&D is about to be fucked up for a year as no college labs, now this may improve the budgets as R&D is the biggest expense, but also means nothing in the pipeline to cover the drops when patents expire and their shit becomes generic.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 11:24:01'] i bought PFE calls after earnings because there was an unusual options activity and DD that Trump kept mentioning the company. They crashed and expired worthless. For that reason, I am out.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 11:42:41'] Great DD. This is a no brainer. Phase 1 vaccine news will be coming end of month and was way oversold.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 13:39:19'] I went long otm on this. 1/15/2021 calls are cheap. Also banking on loads of mental health issues due to being stuck inside.  They're already experiencing shortages of zoloft

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 11:55:27'] Got in earlier before it dropped ~6%. $45 c for 9/18.Thinking we might see a slight reversal on SPY so I‚Äôll hold off and grabbing a few more contracts.Pfizer has multiple candidates and agreements already in place to scale the fuck out of this vaccine if one of the candidates moves forward. Even Fauci has said Pfizer has as good a shot as Moderna to complete it.This has slipped by people because unlike Moderna who‚Äôs releasing literally any updates, Pfizer is being tight lipped. They‚Äôll have results of the phase 1/2 trial by July which is very close to Moderna‚Äôs timeline.Moderna‚Äôs stock has shot up like 300% meanwhile Pfizer‚Äôs didn‚Äôt even budge

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 19:05:56'] "Pfizer are so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates. Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial."&#x200B;I bought calls when this was announced a long time ago and they expired worthless. I might get back in on it tomorrow.If Donald Trump wants to turn the vaccine selection into a gameshow, MRNA will 100% make the top 3 because Trump's vaccine czar is Moncef Slaoui who was a former exec at MRNA. I feel very confident that they would make the top 2 based on this alone. Then Trump can justify rewarding contracts to both of the top 2 because they're both "wonderful", "beautiful" drugs.  Pfizer #1    MRNA #2    J&J #3
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 19:47:28'] Very nice DD.  Typically I've noticed that PFE is quite hard to trade.  It is a very undervalued stock that just doesn't want to move.  Not bad for Iron condors, but not a real money maker.  It would be nice to see PFE make some moves.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 19:55:46'] Vaccine shouldn't affect them, their market cap is so huge.I agree they know what they are doing. Whether or not to buy would be entirely on the oversold thesis, not on vaccine. Would be very hard for retail hype to move a stock of this size. Less hard on a Moderna, and easier still on a low end of small cap like INO or NVAX.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 13:33:00'] I've been watching PFE for a few months and the movement is fairly consistent. I'm hoping to cycle slightly OTM calls 1+ months out, take profits, and rinse repeat as it rises and dips. 37c 7/17 I bought yesterday already up 20% when I took profits.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 18:25:06'] Lol I'm really hopeful on Pfizer.I watched them for about a month and kept up to date on their COVID vaccine dealings. Late last week I had a feeling that some news was finally coming so loaded up on OTM June calls. That was Friday at 3:55pm. Proceeded to watch them release news on the failed breast cancer trial and tank 15 minutes after market close... after hardly any movement in a month. Just bad timing lmao.Missed the better entry price but I still have faith that good news (or even a rumor) on a vaccine will pump them to near $50.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 18:40:30'] Yeah.. probably a good deal.
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 18:40:48'] How do you think Fauci's recent comments will affect Pfizer's coronavirus results/stock price movement? What he said about a covid vaccine wasn't very encouraging, and I think Novavax's stock price reflected this new concern today
	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 18:44:28'] uhm...You really think the Trump short list means anything>? Otherwise the dd is good- but I think all the vaccine makers will remain in play.We will most likley need every vaccine that can be made, the entire industry needs continued support. In a way todays "announcement" was just another example of how this administration continues to fail.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-03 20:56:48'] I bought 5 PFE $40c 9/18 three weeks ago and they're down 40% because of that other news. I thought they were undervalued in general, and they seemed to have tremendous confidence in their vaccine candidates so I figured why not. That said they have a huge market cap and aren't going to move a huge amount no matter what (see: GILD). I also don't think vaccines will be that big of a financial gain for anyone.Holding for now, still think they will move above $40 at some point this summer.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-04 07:12:27'] No one is going to come up with a vaccine for COVID. Just forget it, its like finding a cure for the cold (essentially its the same virus family). If by some slim miracle (which is highly unlikely because its been attempted for almst 20 years), someone does, it wont be available within the next year probably two. By then COVID will have fizzled out. Short MRNA, NVAX and anyone else involved with a COVID vaccine and dont both with any of the big names. They wont be doing anything new or different than before this pandemic.Also, Phase 1 and 2 data is absolutely bullshit. Go read about what it actually means. It has nothing to do with efficacy. It just means no one died from the injection. Phase 1 is when its put in healthy people. Phase 2 is when its put into sick people. Phase 3 will take forever since you cannot actually infect healthy people to see if it worked.Positions: MRNA 45P 1/21 and 50P 07/20

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:47:41'] holy fuck, you are a retard. Lets be clear, the only reason anyone is buying the PFE vaccine is because they ordered months ago, also, because it was the first approved.The addressable market of this vaccine is a few hundred million doses. out of the 8 billion people that live on the planet. This vaccine does not travel well, it needs to be super chilled in freezers worth $15k. This means, that it can only be given in well setup central locations. Billy bob in small/medium town/3rd world will not get this jab. Why is someone going to buy a vaccine that is likely going to get ruined enroute when they can buy the MRNA, (soon to be approved) or the Astra one once they figure their shit out. There is also the sketchy russian one. This PFE vaccine is dead in the water a few months out. PFE is a 200Billion company with 50 billion in revenue figure it out for fucks sake.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 04:53:01'] The problem is that the stock was already up on vaccine news. Nobody really thought the FDA wouldn't approve the drug. So when the good news comes out, anyone who bought it two weeks ago sees the price not go up significantly, and sells. Because realistically, this is the highest the stock will go for a while.It's like the earnings on these 1000x P/E companies. Okay, you can invest in them, in prices that far exceed what their numbers justify. It works in a lot of cases for very innovative or underrated companies. But you can't do that and expect the numbers to make them go up, too.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 07:23:00'] Everyone knew the vaccine would be approved 2 weeks prior ([see](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k2bh3v/fda_will_consider_pfizer_vaccine_for_emergency/gdtf4j2/))You had to sell before the news of the approval broke. Which would be roughly Wednesday or Thursday.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 07:45:58'] Honestly it makes sense. They did the vaccine, they're going to make a ton of money on this, which is why the stock went on a moon mission for the past month.What's left? Exposure to liabilities that could stem from having produced a fucked up vaccine. Upside gone, only downside exposure now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-22 20:06:14'] I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with the prediction that PFE will be the predominant vaccine, but I think it‚Äôs misguided to compare MRNA and PFE. The better comparison is MRNA and BNTX. 1. Pfizer is an established pharma company with 300+ products, they‚Äôre already worth way more than Moderna by market cap. 2. Moderna owns the mRNA tech that they built the vaccine on. They‚Äôre valued on the potential of that technology, not just the covid vaccine. Pfizer is not an mRNA company.3. BioNTech own the tech that the Pfizer vaccine was built on and they have a 50:50 split agreement. Even if The PFE/BNTX vaccine sells twice as many doses as the MRNA vaccine, PFE will only get half of that revenue.MRNA and BNTX are both mRNA biotech companies and their valuations are based on growth potential. PFE is the beneficiary of an agreement with BNTX to co-market their COVID vaccine. Besides that deal, PFE is the same company it was before the pandemic, so the growth valuations on the mRNA companies shouldn‚Äôt apply to PFE. Obviously, the vaccine is very valuable but PFE has already gained $60B in market cap this month.

You and I are hoping to sell our calls to someone who wants a position or larger one in PFE. They could have just bought and hedged with puts.

The same goes for the full auth runup. I‚Äôm straddling tomorrow but more put dominant. Will hold far otm spreads for a pop.

Now we know it's not BS and their packaging of the mrna is significantly more robust tham pfizers. The drugs they have in the pipeline are insane. Also, the impact the vaccine will give to their bottom line is a much bigger deal for them than pfizer. Clearly this has been indicated by modernas big rise recently, but even if the vaccine is already priced in, their future success is not. Tl:Dr: buy stonks

The old drug needed to be administered intravenously. But by July of last year, the Pfizer researchers tweaked the original molecule and came up with a new compound that turned out to be highly potent against Covid-19 and other coronaviruses in the test tube -- and could be used as a pill.¬†

Pfizer has struggled to match Moderna in price due to their amount of outstanding shares, lack of pipe projects, and a bit of activity on the shorting end. HOWEVER, I believe most analysts have the valuation here massively wrong due to lack of foresight in what policies and activist efforts are being pushed forward...\n\nCall options for this thing are CHEAP.

I made a mistake of selling PFE options right before Ex- dividend date so I got assigned. However, someone bought my strike price of $43 when the share was $42.75. So I can't complain.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 17:09:22'] Volatility in the stock market should always be taken into consideration when investing. With so many factors potentially affecting the state of the market, such as anxiousness and uncertainty, it's best to remain mindful of your position. Investing with caution is critical to minimizing risks and possibly seeing rewards in financial growth further down the line. Don't let the erratic swings of stocks accumulate too much trouble for you, take a deep breath and stick to the basics of investing safely.

March was a steady climb, and then a quick acceleration in April riding the upper Bollinger until about 4/21 where it overheated, peak RSI 80.  It has pulled back only slightly from that - MACD is straddling the signal and RSI at 65 - ahead of 5/06 earnings call. The company has been instrumental in addressing the global pandemic.

Congratulations.If you want to be bored beyond tears, read my two fundamental analysis notes on r/stocks.I was recommending Pfizer to anyone who would listen at a little over $39 a share about a month ago. That said, I hedged my position by selling covered calls and that was total idiocy.

Beat Quarterly Sales est 13.6 Billion, actual 14.6 Billion\n3.) RAISED Future Earnings forecast EPS $3.10 -$3.20 to $3.55 -$3.65\n\nThese three happened today, on a market down day.

Do not underestimate the entire World and this vaccine. Yes we are off to a good start in America but the rest of the World is way behind and in dire need of supply. PFE has shown great leadership in production and distribution along with there partner BioNtech. When you hear about vaccine you hear the Top 2 common names, for people who do want vaccine, would like to get, PFE or Moderna.\n\nWhy buy PFE now?

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-27 20:45:58'] I'm really looking forward to seeing MRNA fly once all of this shorting finally gives out. So much BS in here. I'll highlight your 'analysis' of the P1 data. News flash, a mild or moderate fever after getting a vaccine is very common, and indicates that your body is mounting an immune response to the antigen; i.e. it indicates that the vaccine is working. None of the patients in 100 ug dose cohort experienced severe fever, and overall the safety profile for that dose looks very good. There has been no pushback from FDA or NIH on Moderna's clinical testing timeline due to this data. These kinds of posts always seem to leave out that 100% of the 100 ug cohort produced neutralizing antibodies, all of which had titres well above the median titres from convalescent plasma. This is an indication of 100% efficacy (admittedly this may not equate to 100% disease prevention but neutralizing antibody titres are arguably the best available metric if disease prevention is not assessed), which is a very significant achievement in any clinical study.The study design critique is also laughable. Moderna has been working hand-in-hand with NIH and FDA for not only development support but also on clinical study design. The phase 3 study will be conducted almost exactly how FDA wants it. (This also goes for the other companies pursuing vaccines, because they are also working closely with NIH/FDA).On the topic of insider selling, I don't disagree with you that it seems shady. I only partially buy Bancel's argument that it is all standard, pre-planned selling in a locked-in schedule. I wouldn't be surprised if they timed some of their press releases to make those stock sales more favorable. But the thing is, it is possible for a pharma company to have greedy execs and also bring safe/effective products to market. It might be news to you, but it is actually quite common that pharma execs are greedy and do shady things.Your manufacturing comment is poorly researched, MRNA has had contracts secured with large CMO's for months now to achieve the manufacturing volume that they are reporting.One last note, regarding the apparent difference in the drug substance doses for Moderna/BioNTech: what ultimately matters is for the dose that you use, can you achieve a high rate of sufficient efficacy and safety? I.e. if Moderna's dose is just as (or more) effective and just as (or more) safe as the dose that BioNTech selects, the difference really doesn't matter from a therapeutic standpoint.I have exposure to MRNA and PFE. Both are going to do well.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-28 06:19:12'] Alright. PFE beat as expected. Up 3% pre market. Gonna really move as earnings call is coming up in 40 minMRNA pumpers still keeping stock up this morning but I think PFE is going to talk about the results some more of the vaccine they are taking into their phase 3 trial and hopefully that leads to people realizing PFE has a way better chance than Moderna to beat the placebo control group in the 30k phase 3 trial

POST_TEXT: b'*Guys*. Pfizer (PFE) is scheduled to report its Q1 2023 results on tomorrow morning and I fully expect to see higher levels, with its revenue and earnings exceeding the consensus estimates. \n\nLet\'s for a second consider the "pandemic products." Their Covid-19 vaccine and the antiviral pill will definitely see a significant drop in sales. The combined revenue from these two products is estimated to be $21.5 billion in 2023, compared to $56.7 billion in 2022. However, if we were to exclude the Covid-19 products, the companys sales of everything else will likely trend higher. Not only do I expect PFE to post upbeat Q1 results, analysts do find that the stock is undervalued-  I\'ll get into this further. \n\n**Covid-19 products down, but who cares?**\n\n[Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PFE/no-login-required/D048UezA/Pfizer-PFE-Earnings-Preview-PFE-Stock-Likely-To-Trade-Higher-Due-To-FY-2023Q1-Revenues-And-Earnings-Likely-Beating-Expectations?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230430) est'

I believe that the Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) partnership has the clear advantage and will likely be able to show efficacy and obtain FDA approval first among its rivals.\n\n\n--\n\n**Rationale**\nIn order to show efficacy, the standard is that at least 30,000 individuals must be enrolled in a phase 3 trial of a vaccine candidate. This already presents a barrier to smaller companies that cannot muster the logistics to organise and carry out such a study. It improves the advantage of larger companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Although Moderna captured early hype and headlines in the USA for promising early stage results, it will likely lag behind larger companies in crossing the finish line for Phase 3 (see google trends graphic linked below).

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 15:37:49'] Daily refrigerated trucks are being loaded up with vials of liquid that is going to allow markets to reopen and global travel to resume. It will end the year-long onslaught of a disease that has shorn family bonds, ruined people's lives, led to god knows how great a rise in suicides. And on those vials there's going to be a little sticker that says Pfizer. Because Pfizer was ahead every step of the way. Nothing pfizer will ever do will raise their value higher than it has been and will be over the coming months. I say hold until the end of January and if your positions are in the green again at any point sell. If not, just cut your losses
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 17:08:57'] Pfizer is a boomer dividend stock. If you invest in this you are looking for dividends not really price appreciation. I'd bail on these personally

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-20 22:45:47'] I have to remember which sub I am on and code switch. Since this is WSB I bet none of you autist actually read this so here is the TLDR - with the exception of AZN everyone else just talked about their values, vision, and experience in the biotech field. They talked about how they eat crayons in one hole and make brown paste out of the other, there were A LOT of vision story telling and not a whole lot of real plan of action....AZN was the only one who gave something of substance outlining 3 main points.1. They have 300 million vaccines for the US, and ready for 2 billion in total for the world in contracted capacity.2. They are working on a monoclonal vaccine as a backup as well. Yes, their 2nd vaccine based on a different methodology may go to trial before some other names first vaccine.3. They are also working on a treatment getting ready for phase 1 as well. Focus on protecting organ damage that makes covid so scary. (Think Gilead Remdesivir but more focused for covid and not just a general anti viral)....It is not to say the other companies aren't trying. I think it just spells out that while most companies are still drawing pictures on a whiteboard, AZN already may have a product ready to release once approval is had and a forward looking plan for backup/alternative solutions.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-20 19:24:37'] So, the bettors are in the camp that this vaccine will be equally cost effective.  Before any more money is dumped on spec what kind of pricing power will these companies have furthermore if the price is too high, will ppl forego vaccination??? Trying to think this thesis thru...

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-20 19:41:22'] Nobody has a vaccine
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-20 20:24:44'] $NVAX can get there fast too... PFE and MRNA are the best right now, unclear which without more data, followed by AZN a distant third. NVAX reports results tomorrow, and being on a very different platform will have probably different results... But we don't know if better or worse or the same. For the AZN bulls still remaining, AZN had 3-5x less t-cell response depending on the time snapshot you are looking at, and about 2x less neutralizing antibodies than the relevant PFE/MRNA doses.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-20 20:49:58'] if you or a loved one are getting shit on by FDs astrazeneca may be able to help
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-20 21:15:16'] Yeah, but if you actually read the MRK one all the way through they‚Äôre not wrong that nearly half of Americans would refuse a full-on vaccine, so they‚Äôre in the late stage trails for [EIDD-2801](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hn1zzv/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_july_08_2020/fx9pas2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), which is a pill version anti-viral that significantly slows down covid‚Äôs rapid cell growth to the point that the body can stand a chance to fight it off. Basically, hindering covid enough that your immune system can deal with it before it becomes over bearing.

POST_TEXT: b'Howdy yall,\n\nI was checking PFE calls and they are all cheap af for calls that are over 40 strike price. With the upcoming catalyst that the FDA will approve their vaccine for emergency use (dec 10-11), that should rocket the price at least to 40+, or 45. The calls have a portentik to be 20x baggers. Anyone have any reasoning the volume is so low on these calls? Im surprised That PFE isnt trending here. I am holding 250 calls for expiration 12/31 40$. Anyone have any input? Also I know free float is 5.5b so itll take a lot of volume to move it, but Apple moves 3-4% on news and it has 4x the amount of float. Am I missing anything?\n\nEdit: before you all say it, yes Im already holding PLTR 40c for Jan baby '

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 07:12:15'] Yerp. Bought LEAPS in the way back when I first heard they were working on vaccines. Sold the news. Converted profits to equity. Bought another LEAPS on the way down, slow and steady ride up, been running a PMCC, never through earnings. Premiums are low but consistent.Its a good company. Profits arent going anywhere. Profits support dividend. Its about as boomer as boomer stonks come. Side note, of the available vaccines anecdotes are Pfizer has the least side effects. Thats the beat on the street. Vaccine is just fueling revenue and paying back development costs, no real profits.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 08:28:59'] It's at 70 RSI rn though. At least wait before buying in if anybody is considering hopping in immediately.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 19:27:31'] I'm long as well. I really think this is a sleeping giant. Price pre covid-19 was $40 - $45 range. It gets a boost to those levels temporarily after vaccine announcement then drops off to Nowhere.This stock is poised to grow from Covid-19. There market share is continually getting bigger with JNJ and Astra Zen now receiving halts and negative press.BioNtech reported there recent earnings... who partners with PFE on vaccine. BioNtech blew earnings out of the water. Expected loss of -$0.99 to $0.64 they reported $1.85PFE also filed for adolescent vaccination authorization in America and Europe.With dwindling trust in the other vaccines and more people to give vaccines too with potential boosters. Im surprised this isn't in $50. Boomer stock or not... boom boom. Im in.I hold 23 May 21st C $37.I had 47 at one point but cashed out for some other plays. I'm holding now to upper 40s. Earnings should be great based off BioNtech bump.Update: EARNINGS BEAT, REVENUE BEAT, FUTURE EXPECTATIONS INCREASED!Add potential for new markets like India, 12 - 15 USA and Europe Approval, and ultimately Full approval!$$$Time to load up to $50

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 13:41:58'] FD I own 100 shares but the revenue and profit bump from the vaccine is viewed as a one off. Not a source of long term recurring revenue and profit. That's why the stock continues to trade well below 40. They will have to turn this one trick pony (MRNA tech) into additional vaccines and treatments for other diseases.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-09 18:22:51'] I'm probably going to buy some calls on pfe tomorrow morning. Might just ride the wave as I expect it to have dumb dumb strength for at least tomorrow.You are wrong about the virus getting worse, though. Historically viruses evolve to be less lethal because killing your host is a bad way to keep spreading. The truth is many of us have likely already encountered a coronavirus in our lives, but it just felt like a cold.From what I understand covid will likely be here evolving andinfecting us forever like many other similar viruses. At worst it'll be as lethal as the flu and we will have to keep guessing at what strain is gonna be most prevalent and try to get people vaccinated yearly. At best it'll just change into another annoying cold.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 02:21:38'] I am going to add something else to your post which by the way I find quite compelling thematically, we could have quite the debate about why PFE and BioNTech are or aren't good investment.As you have somewhat pointed out, in the short term not much money is going to be made. That is a well understood phenomenon in biotech. A tangential example would be the scarce development of new antibiotics. New compounds are really expensive to develop and once one is found governments regulate the shit out of them because of how absolutely fucking important they become.Now, what is at play here, something truly transformational is the technology behind this (and several competing) vaccines. PFE/BioNTech [BNT162](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNT162) is an mRNA vaccine. Instead of injecting some "weakened" form of the pathogen and hoping for the body to be like "oh heck you shouldn't be here" and mount an immune response without killing you in the process, an mRNA vaccine consists on isolating some part of the genetic material of the virus, stabilizing it and then injecting it in your body. Inside your cells the genetic material is converted into the corresponding protein, and if effective, an immune response is obtained. PFE/BioNTech HAVE JUST SHOWN THAT THIS FUCKING IDEA WORKS!! Yeah, everybody was expecting for it to work, but they actually did. That means they have a bunch of data and expertise to guess what?.?.?.? DEVELOP many more vaccines!!! Not only against microbes, but also for practically any agent. Cancer? Sure, just look for the mutational signatures most likely to enhance an immune response. Dementia? Sure, just go through the dozens of genetic markers associated with protein aggregation in the nervous system. Aging? Hell yeah, a lot has been uncovered about the biology of senescent cells which can be targeted and treated.As you mentioned this is a pivotal moment for the human race. Do you think this is all bullshit speculation? Fair enough, there are many challenges ahead and a lot of charlatans will emerge. Will only these two companies emerge victorious?  Absolutely no. You shall all be very excited. THIS IS NOT INVESTING ADVICE!!  BNTX 01/21/22 C140.000  stockPFE, MRNA, BioNTech, PACB, ILMN

POST_TEXT: b'Hi all\n\nI would like to share the knowledge and experience I have gained by reporting on analysis of the stocks I pick as long-term buys. These shares are **value oriented which means that the price of the share is lower that what the company could be at based on the finances of the company**. I use free cash flow metric since having profitable steady cash flow is paramount to continued growth of the company.  These valuations are calculated using the **conservative assumptions** leaning towards a grimmer outlook than what may be to hedge against the worst-case scenario. For example, in current calculations for the CPAM (capital asset pricing modeling) I am using a 9% return of the S&P500 benchmark (as opposed to 10% overall or 24% for 2019), and for a return available on a risk-free investment is using a 10-year CD fixed rate of 2.5%).

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-18 09:15:50'] I bought some PFE in late sept. Up by 3.32% but i believe there is significant tendie potential. It does swing a bit from day to day, but i can feel like theres a potential upswing coming. Dunno when, dunno how. Im just autistic enough to know.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-18 09:52:25'] In my view $35.5-$36 is a good entry point and there is an upside potential as long as they don't do something terrible. The issue with the upside is that in their business it's hard to stumble on a major rally. They would need a new drug with a huge distribution potential in order to have a serious run. In absence of that it's going to be a slow climb.  There is also a good chance of being stuck with a stock that has rather minor fluctuations for a while .  I guess what I'm trying to say is that there are better opportunities.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-18 11:39:44'] So you have two scenarios - no growth and growth. Your no growth is the worst case scenario. What about the scenario where sales decline? I would consider this the worst case.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-18 12:11:51'] 9% return for CPAM doesn't seem that conservative to me. We've been in a record bull market for a while now, and to assume 9% going forward is a bit unrealistic.

Several countries are already signing contracts with the company for doses. The UK and Canada are currently reviewing their data. Positions: MRNA $70 calls 1/15/21

Covid is too unpredictable and even if they make a vaccine it may not even be effective. People may not want to, or refuse to take it. The election result will cause polarizing outcomes given how opposite each party feels about the pandemic and how to handle it, which brings even more volatility in predicting this stock play. No thanks!

In those times the fed largely let the market do its thing but now they just flush inflation into the market to keep things elevated. Stocks aren‚Äôt worth more than they were twenty years ago it just takes a lot more worthless money to buy them. The house of cards will fall someday but not by past examples.

POST_TEXT: b"Now that I have purchased my initial tranche, I want to say that PFE (Pfizer) looks really good here for a rally but the stock is vulnerable to a little pullback.  When looking at the chart of the relative strength vs other major stocks and indicies, PFE looks primed for a rally.  In particular, I like the relative strength of PFE vs the QQQs.  The PFE:QQQ ratio looks to have bottomed out.  That provides good safety for traders.\n\nNFLX > PFE > USO\n\nI ranked the 3 stocks above by rally potential.  NFLX is still in the infancy of a rally.  PFE is next up.  USO rallied a decent amount already, so some of the rally potential has been used up.\n\nIf you are interested in the short side, I have a few stocks that are what I consider bearish.  However, I wouldn't short them in this environment because of the high liquidity.\n\nT > GLD > HD\n\nT has the highest short potential of the 3."

That would essentially be enough to pay off all short term debt only leaving them with long term liabilities.\n\nThe CEO did sell off a significant portion of his shares on Monday when the vaccine was announced. Huge sell off today as the news has been circulating.\n\nI would expect a huge turn around over the next two days. There will be an increase of buying pressure from institutions wanting to scoop up free shares as well as a decrease in sell orders from institutions wanting to keep those shares.\n\nPlay: buy a shit ton of calls ITM or ATM for end of week and try to exercise one to get free shares through the merger. Good luck'
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-11 09:45:50'] Stock is trending down. I am sure people are doing the math on how much PFE has to drop before it makes more sense to sell and just pick up PFE and Viatris on sale in a week or couple of weeks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 13:01:03'] It's hard to not fall for the hopium.  But, lets be real.  People are broke.  Earnings are going to disappoint because, people are broke.  Un-employment will rise, and people are already broke.  Inflation is still out of control, but slightly lower, no pivot on energy, war still brewing in Chyna, and of course, the Ukraine Fiasco.  Sure, we may have it better than Europe, but life isn't getting better anytime soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 10:09:38'] How many times has the Fed timed their monetary policies perfectly to protect the economy?It‚Äôs always lagging. Markets view this as inflation going down and economy stabilizing, we will see a rally for some weeks or months if the decline in inflation continues, until we end up in a recession. Just throwing wild opinions out there, but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the Fed fucks up as they did with the late response to inflation and drag us into a recession in 2023.

POST_TEXT: b'Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers\nFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investments price.\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded).

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-08 20:42:41'] There is a reason why these calls are cheap.  May be they have not caught on the analysis.  Anything that far away like March it is hard to anticipate what PFE is going to be like.  I agree it will go up short term.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-11 21:33:07'] so you buy these boring stocks for fun huh, the premiums are low because no one thinks the stock will fluctuate much, whereas if you bought a highly volatile stock or earnings coming up, of course the premium will be high. As for PFE , I think alot of people think its gonna grow poorly. The others, maybe the risk reward ratio is worth it.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-08 20:38:47'] This is some valuable DD. I've been watching similar stocks including BMY.One of the questions I've had is now that a company like BMY has acquired CELG how is their stock affected long term? They trade around $58 and CELG trades around $109. I've read 2020 est. of BMY at $70~. When two companies merge, how does it affect their stock price?
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-09 11:31:31'] I agree with your logic and I spent a few weeks trying to catch the move in PFE. The options were dirt cheap, liquidity good... yet they move so.incredibly.slow. The stock seems to move +-.05 every day. It‚Äôs such a painfully slow mover. Even the weekly options barely moved a few dollars here and there. Anyway, my point is, yes the options are cheap but it‚Äôs because actual volatility is so low. If you are patient and you‚Äôre okay with allocating capital to a low volatility, slow mover, then this is a good idea.

However, I cannot say for certain what the future holds. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 16:38:20'] Hi
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 02:51:08'] For those wondering what this has to do with Hans Niemann, he was accused of cheating in chess by the current world #1, Magnus Carlsen (albeit indirectly). There was speculation of how one would cheat and the concept of another person observing the game and running it through a computer to work out the best move came up. The issue is how to tell the player which move to make - so there was a hupothesis that Hans Niemann inserted vibrating anal beads in his ass and was told the moves in morse code via the vibrations. Elon Musk decided to weigh in as he always does.In a subsequent tournament, Hans was searched and scanned with a metal detector. Particular attention was paid to his ass and onlookers couldnt contain their amusement. So yes, chess, anal beads and now wsb. Enjoy.

Nobody wants to get jabbed every 4 months. \n\n[Moderna CEO telling the world they are about to lose a shit ton of revenue](https://youtu.be/gAnVSFYTN1A)\n\nIve always been on the #fuckpfizer train because they have a history of being corrupt scumbags. \n\nAlso my jnj vax fucked me up for 24 hours worse than any medicine/vaccine ever has so theres that. (Not saying covid vax bad, it saved many lives but that shit hurt and I lowkey regret it) \n\nPostions: PFE $43 1/19/23 puts maybe adding modernbruh to that'

I went to the er I was so worried I told them I just got my second shot and they told me it was a super common side effect they were seeing in men. My heart rate ended up going down but it was a stressful 24 hours to be honestEdit: also I made also 4k in puts on Moderna in its last November earnings.

MRNA is down 70% from ATH in August, BNTX is down 60%, and both are done declining and are moving sideways.PFE just got EUA for vaccinating kids 5-11, only stock that still has anywhere to fall, and that's after the demand for those vaccines is satisfied.Good luck with those puts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 20:48:35'] I only got jabbed twice. I tried to be a sport about "now you need a booster" but then public places stopped even asking me to wear a mask. Don't tell people they're fully anything or when you try to roll that back, you can fully go fuck yourself. I was never anti vax or anti mask. I accepted the wisdom in "crushing the curve" but that is like needing padding for a punctuated event. Can't crash forever. For better or worse society has voted to "let it rip" if you are vulnerable, you've had time to take your vaccine and or say your good byes and move to the farm. No one lives for ever even those of us surviving *this time*.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 22:35:46'] The pandemic wasn‚Äôt going to last forever and I don‚Äôt think there solid science to justify giving people a 4th booster. But it has $15 billion of cash it use to build it self into a global pharmaceutical company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 19:09:44'] Dude, same sentiment with jnj. Fucked my world up for a day, didn‚Äôt feel right for a week. 6 months later got Covid for 52 days. Clearly not anti-vax, but don‚Äôt know what would be needed to persuade me to bend over for that again.

What I'm saying is, I foresee a stock purchase program funded by poor people's tax dollars, but this time for these pharma giants we can't let fail. Source: zero due diligence. Also, the 10B is apprx net loss, not the amount spent on the stock purchasing. That's the realized loss from the US government selling GM stock back to GM for lower than purchased.

They basically just forced the entire working population of the country to take 2 - 4 doses by going "lol HIPAA doesn't exist" and pretty much every institution went along with it. I would not be shocked at all if in the next 6 months another push along those lines was done especially while Democrats control every chamber of Washington. Yes yes I know this is reddit and only the RNC is corrupt but healthcare / Pharma is to Democrats what big oil is to Republicans so giving their biggest donor outside of tech one last "thanks for always being there for me" before they lose in November, or as a thank you for funding us if they win in November, wouldn't be out of the question. TLDR: Nah they'll just force everyone to take more again before they start losing too much money. Wall Street is your doctor now.

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investments price.\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded).

Look at things like financial statements, news stories, analyst ratings, and insider buying/selling activity to get a sense of whether or not a particular stock is a good investment.2. Be aware of the risks involved in any investment you make. Stocks are risky because their prices can go up or down rapidly, so you could lose money if you don't know what you're doing.

POST_TEXT: b'Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers\nFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investments price.\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\n\nUptrending Tickers\n\n* PLUG   2/24/23 15.5C    1.09\n* VMW'

I agree that it is probably a political move to save face, but it could also be a sign of things to come in terms of China approving foreign vaccines. If the US can work out some kind of agreement with China on this issue, it would be a big win for both countries.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 14:32:48'] AMD
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 15:24:58'] AMD, NVDA, and DIS... all beaten down waaaaaaay too far.AMD and NVDA are refreshing their product lines between fall 2022 and spring 2023. Major refresh. New GPUs will be 2-3x faster than current ones. AMD's CPUs will have big arch improvements.Demand for their chips is still high. Current GPUs are 2 years old and close to end-of-production but still selling above MSRP and difficult to find.Also, many analysts are worried about a chip glut or a gaming slowdown. There won't be a chip glut for at least several years (production capacity hasn't increased in a major way for years and won't increase until 2024 plus the upcoming product refresh will actually INCREASE demand) and any gaming slowdown is basically temporary plus these companies don't just make gaming GPUs, they have very healthy non-gaming segments like AI/ML, automotive, HPC, and datacenter.Domestic supply chains for both AMD and NVDA will improve greatly as TSMC's 5nm fab in AZ opens up in 2023 and ramps up to full blast by 2024.Disney has a ton of high-demand content coming out soon (KENOBI) plus more growth from parks/experiences coming as travel becomes more expensive and going to Disney World becomes a far cheaper/better option than going to Europe or the Bahamas.Bonus pick: GFS... They're going to take over the 2nd tier fabbing we do overseas and turn it domestic. That's critical for the US's effort to De-Chinese-ify American businesses.Not sure why people keep pumping money into energy... the west is trying to shrink usage of Oil and Nat gas asap. Not shift, SHRINK.AKA - large-scale Oil and Nat gas demand destruction is happening as we speak. Energy seems like a dumb play.

They have been hiring and expanding like crazy. They rent office space in SF at the Dropbox HQ. If you know about real estate, you know how significant that is. While most small cap biotechs are hurting for cash right now and could be targeted for buyouts, these guys still have a product on the markets generating revenue and a 4 year cash runway thanks to Q4/Q1

Secondly ask yourself, is this a company that will be relevant and in demand 10 years from now? Now if that stock looks super cheap, buy some up!  May not be the best price and the drop in the market may continue but chances are this stock will return to glory sooner than later.  Good luck!

But yeah everyone on here just likes to hear themselves talk and have their stupid conspiracy theories validated so most of you won't. Personally, I've gotten every jab and haven't gotten COVID. But who am I, just some dude who doesn't believe a word he hears from chuckleheads in the internet. I'd wait for a better study before passing judgement. But you dimwits can believe what you want.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-14 15:41:35'] Been trading for over a year now and from my experience and seeing people on social media, I have learn to have two portfolios, one for long term investment and short term investment. I rarely buy any options, calls, puts etc‚Ä¶ I invest small amounts on my long term investment with stocks that are under $50 (to buy the most stock for the least amount of money) and keep buying the dips on those that have dropped quite of bit by adding small amounts. My long term portfolio also helps me by big bets on my short term portfolio because I have been watching closely how my long term stocks been performing or any news of those stock. So I buy a lot and trade for a day or a few days. My short term portfolio also helps me buy more expensive stocks for short term trade. This helps me lose a little and gain a little but with a long term short gains instead of yoloing one stock.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-15 06:06:57'] Totally agree, but to defend us retards: it's not just wsb. Also wallstreet analysts don't talk much about bubble risk anymore. They kind of all accept that clearly overpriced market could be here to stay... which they never do. But the question is when it pops and how much you miss out if you don't join until then. Also think that Evergrande could be the start of bubbles bursting.It's btw just a very general problem that people don't see the risk anymore, when it didn't materialize over some time. "This time is different"

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-14 19:29:22'] Benjamin Graham once observed that, ‚Äúin the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it‚Äôs a weighing machine.‚Äù That is, the market must eventually revert to the mean of fair value or lower. However, this *short run* has gone on since 2009 and could potentially continue running as John Maynard Keynes once lamented, ‚ÄúThe stock market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs possible the fallout from China‚Äôs failing market is contagious, and could get worse, and it‚Äôs equally possible that either the contagion has already been priced in or Evergrande somehow survives. What we can be sure of is that all the charts will keep heading rightward and that we ought always to keep Warren Buffett‚Äôs sage advice in mind: ‚ÄúBuy the dip, faggot.‚Äù

POST_TEXT: b'Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers\n\nFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investments price. \n\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. \n\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded).

Meanwhile, estimates show a rise of over 8.5% in revenues for 2016 and a further rise of ~5.0% in revenues for 2017 due to the growth of revenues from oncology and alliances.\n\nThe gross margin is expected to improve from 80.7% in 2014 to 81.2% in 2015 but is projected to fall to ~78.6% in 2016 and ~78.8% in 2017. The rise in 2015 is due to the lower cost of sales. On the other hand, the operating profit margin is expected to rise to ~37.0% in 2015 from 26.8% in 2014. Its further expected to improve to ~38.3% in 2016 and ~39.3% in 2017.

MRNA is the best long term investment from the widely vaccines available, did you know it cost ¬£20 per dose? And paid by government?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 16:54:13'] This is not a great study to draw the conclusions you are trying to draw. It says it itself if you actually go to the source and not the sensationalized journalism:>The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak. As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented because of detection bias. Third, demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants; further study is underway to identify other population characteristics among cases, such as additional demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.\*\*\* MA DPH, CDC, and affected jurisdictions are collaborating in this response; MA DPH is conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples for genomic sequencing, and linking case information with laboratory data and vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.‚Ä†‚Ä†‚Ä† Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings.

However we have known since we started vaccination that the premise of the vaccine is to prevent severe symptoms, ICU, and death.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 12:31:07'] Getting the vaccine was never supposed to make you never get an infection. It's to prevent severe infection. It gives your immune system a head start. The percentage of people being hospitalized with covid now are like 95% unvaccinated people. I don't think vaccinated individuals getting sick is going to shake the markets, especially if they are having only minor illness.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 12:21:38'] Market Black Swan, doubt it, Fed set a floor on the markets last year, per their statement as of last week, the floor remains intact. Doesn‚Äôt mean we won‚Äôt see any healthy pull backs.Black Swan IMO might be on population size if anything. Only victims will be the kids who are ineligible for vaccination or parents who chose not to be vaccinated & made the same decision for their offsprings.The conspiracy theory tards deny the same science that is used to make today‚Äôs technology, computers, iPhones you name it.  However, they will gladly use the technology because it‚Äôs convenient. Anything of inconvenience is an infringement on freedom. LMAOIt‚Äôs just a study of atoms, structures, reactions & energy.If one likes going against the general population, well then you would have taken Covid seriously since early last year when the general population ignored it. Now that the masses realize the complexity of a virus, now isn‚Äôt the time to be ‚Äúagainst‚Äù the norm. Everyone has a right to choose to be or not to be vaccinated. Everyone has the right to choose if they wish to use their brain or not.  Perhaps the silver lining is a decrease in the tard population.Show me any part of the world with low education & I‚Äôll show you a much higher concentration of tards in those areas: extremists, cults, conspiracy theorists, fanatics & fascists.  After all, it wasn‚Äôt that long ago people were burning witches.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 12:45:29'] Delta is the overwhelmingly most common variant in the UK right now, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt feel like anything that might cause a huge market crash.  Infection rates went quite high for a week or two after we removed all limits on social contact and most mandatory mask rules on 19 July, but infection rates are already going down.  Hospitalisations and deaths have remained low because we have vaccinated so many.  Honestly covid doesn‚Äôt feel like much of a threat any more.  More damage was done to the economy by an overblown reaction to the disease than the disease itself, and I don‚Äôt think the govt would impose a lockdown again as public sentiment is now so heavily in favour of just getting on with our lives.

Why weren‚Äôt inactivated virus vaccines given EUA? The data from Israel, whose vaccine strategy was very much like ours, suggests  the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine is reduced by 1/2 every 3-4 weeks. Now, I‚Äôm not saying that there are dishonest players in big pharma who used their lobbying clout to get Pfizer a 27B deal for a questionable product, but it seems as Pfizer lobbyists perhaps used their clout in DC to get a 27B deal for a questionable product, and now they are pushing for booster shots for a vaccine that perhaps doesn‚Äôt work that well. Inactivated Virus vaccines create t-cells that can ward off infection potentially for years. Also, antivax people can‚Äôt shout weird things about genetic modifications with these vaccines. What I‚Äôm saying, actually, is I‚Äôm buying OCGN calls on Monday. Covaxin is likely getting WHO approval this month, they have a manufacturing plant set up in US,  they have the right to sell in Canada who will perhaps provide doses to the rest of the world. So even if the FDA is as cognitively deficient as joe biden himself and we don‚Äôt get Covaxin, that Stock is gonna pump with WHO approval and then I‚Äôm moving to Europe while the US turns into the Last of Us.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-23 12:28:32'] I don‚Äôt know that WSB is the place for NVAX.I fully expect this to rip next year on massive revenues. Great pipeline to be bullish on as a speculator. Killer revenue coming in over the next three years from a COVID vax that will become the gold standard everywhere. Just have to wait for the world to catch up with what we believe in. I hold my shares, load up on like 60 day out expiration calls, sell on spikes, load more shares on the way down, rinse and repeat. Also slowly accumulating LEAPS.A $100B market cap seems very realistic in the next 2 years and that puts the SP around $1000. I‚Äôm long as hell.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-23 11:54:47'] Novavax is also the frontrunner for a flu+covid shot. No other company has both tested and through phase 3 trials.There is very little chance that this week's drop is organic. There has been a barrage of positive news, and omicron being milder is the only plausible reason for the selloff. But the drop is incommensurate with the rise when Omicron fear gripped the market. The drop is irrational for another reason - a variant which spreads faster and has some vaccine/immune evasion is precisely the impetus to boost AND to mix and match the booster dose. At an individual level, if you must get infected, you might prefer Omicron over Delta, but at the community level, something that spreads 5x faster and does 0.5x less harm is exactly you would urgently want to vaccinate/boost against if you have the means. This applies to the richest countries where the tier 1 profits come from. Of course, we're all familiar with how important NVAX is for the rest of the world to control the pandemic.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-23 08:44:11'] All very good points. Not to mention right before covid they completed phase 3 trial for a Flu vaccine that performed better than what is currently on the market. Once the covid vaccines are being delivered I expect them to resume the work to have the flu vaccine approved as well as a flu/covid combined vaccine that should be useful going forward.  Several more short term catalysts are imminentEdited a typo

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 03:08:31'] Yes and no. I think the only thing that‚Äôs going to lift this is actually reporting revenue, and that‚Äôs not going to happen until Q2 2022 at the earliest. They have 3 main clients, Operation Warp Speed, the EU member states, and doses sold through covax. However, deliveries to all three of those are still months away. USA: there is a new 30 day waiting period after a submission. If they submit before the end of the year (possible not guaranteed), there‚Äôs a 30 day delay. Then the FDA starts reviewing the application. This will probably take around 2 months (based on Pfizer + Moderna EUA). So the absolute earliest they can deliver doses is March, right after the entire country has finished being boosted. EU:  they have a contract to deliver up to 200M doses, however individual member states have only ordered 27M against that capacity. And 3 member states (Italy, Denmark, Austria) have said they will expect deliveries in late February/early March at the earliest.Covax: The manufacturer for covax is the same as for EU (Serum Institute). Logically, if it will take > 2-3 months for deliveries to start to the EU, it‚Äôll be about the same delay for Covax as well, since the manufacturer is the same. The wild card is India, but there‚Äôs political fuckery going on there. They seem to think that the other locally produced vaccine is a source of Indian pride, (although it is of course made under license, like novavax). So no guarantees there. Basically, they are 2-3 months away from any revenue at all, and then probably 5-6 months away from significant revenue, since the serum institute still has to scale up production. The shorts won‚Äôt let go of it until then. And the longer they delay, the riskier it gets. There‚Äôs going to actually be a huge oversupply of doses in 2022, if they can‚Äôt get this thing out soon countries will source their vaccines from other suppliers, and they‚Äôll be stuck picking up the scraps Pfizer doesn‚Äôt want.

The approvals that are expected are I believe mostly priced in. Those approvals were initially expected six months ago but despite delays they are still expected. Omicron is looking mild. Vax stocks are losing their sex appeal/meme appeal, see the charts of MRNA and BNTX both down roughly 50% from their 2021 highs. I would still not discount a white swan event (opposite of black swan) where covid fades away which would be a white swan for everyone but a black swan for the vax makers. Small chance, which is why it's a swan. But spanish flu basically disappeared after two years and three waves.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-23 16:54:58'] BNTX and Pfizer have  59% of the Vax market, throw in Moderna, and you have over 90% of the market accounted for.  Covid vaccine retention for the two market leaders is over 90%. People will usually take the same vaccine.   Revenue is very sticky.  NVAX is very late to the game, even given its alternative formula.  To make inroads in market share is a tough get at this late date.  Right now, there is no good news that is able to provide a positive catalyst for the vaccine stocks.  Doesn't seem to matter what is forthcoming, new approvals, new exploding mutations, plainly obvious need for new vaccines to treat new mitations, incredible new orders, huge order books, promising pipelines, ---the Vax stocks are getting hammered and the charts look bearishly  bleak.Does it make sense???  BNTX is at 253, it was 460 in August and is the quarter's worst NASDAQ performer, and the pandemic isn't getting better and the positive catalyst have come and gone left and right.   At its current SP, it's P/E is like 7.  It is wildly oversold and incredibly cheap, as is perhaps NVAX.  But it's only going lower from the looks of it.  Perhaps the Vax stocks are going down because people who bought in August over 400 are bailing out for tax purposes.  However, it is highly probable that these stocks are being manipulated by the big boys, given the trading patterns that are happening.  One thing for sure in my mind, it's crazy to buy options with this group.  Moderna leads the pack as it is included in many ETFs, and all of them are trading as a sector, and the sector is on a solid downtrend.  Not sure if the sector constitutes a falling dagger, but it's close to it the last few days.  But the whole sector is volatile, and has had near 100 point swings at least 3 times since August.  So you never know.  But I'd pick an entry point carefully at this point, the sector is likely to go lower in the short term.  Might be a better idea to day trade also, and if you get ahead, under no circumstances use a stop loss.Longer term, Pfizer and BNTX are making billions, and the fundamentals are sound.  Their next earning reports will be blowouts, they will not miss, but if they are on the beat but light side, or provide poor guidance, a 20%;dump is totally probable.  If you have the stomach for being heavily red at times, and can invest biggly and are the gambling type, the payoff could be hughe if you can wait it out, if not, play in a different sector.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-23 08:12:38'] Do they have a vaccine for FOMO?  My guess is you lose 30%.The vaccine is too late and Omicron is demonstrating that the next variant is around the corner, and that will always be true.  You should be invested in the Merck at home anti-viral, that is where the medical community wants this to go.I don't think there is much more public appetite for another vaccine, and within a nearly 90% vaccine rate, who are the people getting this one?  Where is their market share coming from?  Kids are the only ones left really, that 10% hasn't been sitting around waiting for the Novavax vaccine.This is purely a FOMO position, you only make money if their lobbyists have greased enough palms for a mandate from the government (like J&J did).

POST_TEXT: b'* **Forecast for this week** (see full details on financials further down)\n\nThis week BNTX will shine; Q3 ER on Tuesday and oncology congress 10-14 November (see pipeline below). Moderna missed earning last week and reduced the guidance for 2021; this reduction was not driven by lack of demand, it was driven by delays in manufacturing. BNTX-PFE jumped in and took over the demand Moderna failed to serve. The current drop is still an overreaction of the market to the Pfizer anti-viral which cause a lot of Stop/Loss drops and liquidation of call options.\n\nPfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be $13 Bn, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from $33 Bn to $36 Bn. Consensus estimate is $12.27 EPS Q3. We estimate a somewhat better result, $12.75 at minimum, driven by a/o higher sales volume and improved financing result. Similar to what happened to this stock for Q4 2020 earning on March 31st 2021, the most likely scenario is a rally starting directly after the Q3 earnings.\n\n'

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 08:22:15'] But the market already knows almost exactly how much BNTX made from the PFE earning, since PFE does break out the vaccine earnings, and BNTX makes almost exactly same as PFE since they have a 50/50 profit split agreement.BNTX already rallied right after PFE earning, but was beaten down again by the news of covid pill from PFE. I don't think BNTX's own earning will have any real effect on its price. Though a rally could still happen simply due to it has went down so much already, bottom buyers may buy in, and indeed a good earning, even though already well known by the market, may be a catalyst.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 19:45:29'] Listen to the guy about 75/25 split in safe/highrisk investment. Safe high dividend stocks would be best. Normally I would recommend banks, but I got advised there were better places in the current market. If you're going into options with no experience I would take a small percentage of the high risk portion of your funds to experiment with.Microsoft is definitely safe and there could be decent upside in all the stocks with planned splits. GOOG, AMZN and TSLA would be a good idea to research for you at least in the short term.There are few stocks that can be mentioned here, but Uranium is good in my opinion to at least consider. Avoid options for it as volatility is a big factor here. U.UN and EFR/UUUU are the only ones I have that can be mentioned here. CCJ would be a safer play, but its too expensive for me.

What that means is maybe take 100k and buy 1k a week of a broad market index fund over the next 2 years, something like that.  Keep a big chunk of this money as a emergency fund.  Personal advice, if you have always been broke you need to get used to having money now and not feel like this money is burning a hole in your pocket.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 05:01:54'] First of all, there is no rush. Your life won‚Äôt be ruined because you sat it in a savings account for a year thinking about what to do. It depends on your personal situation, how old u are, debt levels, assets, etc. If you truly don‚Äôt know, then find a fiduciary financial advisor. I would try to find one that charges a fee for a financial plan and not a fee for assets under management. There are lots of them out there. Betterment has fee for plan services, so does facet wealth, your employer may have financial planning benefits, etc. You should also go get a book on financial planning.

Yea there‚Äôs a small chance you‚Äôll make a shit ton of money, but a much much larger chance that you‚Äôll lose it all.  If you‚Äôre poor I‚Äôm guessing you also don‚Äôt have a good career or prospect for a good career.  Why not find a good and well paying career path that you like and you want to go down and use that $200k to pay for an education for that career path and for living expenses while you do that.  If you choose a 4 year degree you could probably stretch that money out all 4 years.  If not then you can at least stretch it out for 2-3 years while you get good grades and can then qualify for grants and scholarships.  You are very unlikely to create an income you can live off of comfortably and safely for a long time off of $200k.  Use the money to invest in yourself and you will always have the ability to generate a lot of income for yourself.Engineering pays really well for example, and you really only need a bachelor‚Äôs degree.  You can go into computer science or computer engineering and become a programmer, also high paying and also only needs a bachelor‚Äôs.  Data science as well I believe.  Or you can go down a trade route.  Maybe an electrician or an auto mechanic?  Research what these jobs typically pay and their growth outlook, and then pick one that you would enjoy doing.  You have an opportunity here to set yourself up for life, don‚Äôt squander it.

There is a set market for video streaming and with Netflix's numbers coming out we saw they are not gaining as many users as before, my thesis is that Dis+ took most of it with better kid friendly content. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11f5bxylc0\n\n\nWe saw what Snap did when Facebook reported they were losing marketshare, I am adopting the same thesis to Disney taking Netflix marketshare. Not to mention Encanto being one of Disneys biggest movies this quarter - https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=encanto\n\n\nOn Vaccines we know that more and more people are vaccinated and with both theme parks open we should see more and more people heading to parks. With JnJ reporting massive vaccine sales we should see MRNA and PFE also report the same which just means more people are vaccinated.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 20:29:41'] Not a fan of the Disney app.  It‚Äôs by far worse than Netflix, Amazon, FuboTV, YouTubeTV, even peacock and DirectTV stream.  For one, it‚Äôs missing several basic features.  Play from beginning, the ability to scroll through an episode or season without having to start whichever one was already going and back out and go back in.  The coding makes the overall app slow, which make basic features like the plus minus 10/15 second feature not work efficiently.  It lacks good information offer apps have when the show is playing.  Apart from that, it still doesn‚Äôt have a lot of content, although the quality of content is top notch. The only good thing about the Disney plus app is the content, but the software is garbage.  They need to hire extensively several more software engineers and look at making some acquisitions.  They are moving to live TV now, streaming an upcoming awards show. I‚Äôm skeptical it will work well since their current app is already so far behind where it needs to be.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 07:55:27'] This is why you should be trading futures, and looking what happens with EU around 3am EST.IT fell *HARD* in the last few hours to open, near what would be spy 433.91. Thats where it started to bounce.It might still go back down, but that might of been the 50 MA being tested. It might of just been oversold, and when the US woke up they bought the dip at 5am. Whatever narrative works, but if you payed attention to /ES you would of probably held your calls.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 20:44:45'] I already bought 2dte at close. If it hits 50ma I‚Äôll prolly go close to all in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 21:48:40'] I think I figured out a easier TA, when that MRNA rockets dump the SPY calls, when it crashes get back in, seriously the one two punch of Corona, Taper talk and Biden making a announcement about the Delta variant caused the panic sell off, people are going to lick their wounds and come out in 48 hours. YMMV>Don't Panic! >Monitor your positions > Max pain stop loss. I expect some heavy hitters to come out in full force to hold hands and make the fear go away.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 20:12:03'] Yeah these bulls are getting wayyy to confident, we are so far away from the 50 dma it‚Äôs really not funny and this correction is going to knock so many accounts out
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 21:56:04'] you really think they are gonna let the premiums on puts go itm and expire itm?? its all about how the mm‚Äôs wanna make money and that way is pumping this shit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 22:33:21'] Simple way to know what‚Äôs going to happen- look at the highest OI options and know that they won‚Äôt hit so adjust accordingly
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 22:58:21'] So if you knew it's gonna test 50 MA  on 18th and you are not retard then why you bought calls before that?

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 15:03:33'] Sup homie, curious how you did today.  Didn't go exactly as planned but that 434 PM might have been the initial support.  I scaled up and down and was pretty positive.  Missed the 2:30 rip though, that sucked.  Looks like easy money there.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 21:50:34'] heavily doubt we will test 433, considering we need to maintain higher highs so long as we are QE‚Äôed up, tapering wont do much, we test 437 and bounce back to ath in the span of 3-4 days
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 22:59:03'] Nah.Green by open.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 20:28:50'] Plus 3.1 billion sell side imbalance in close guarantees the open can‚Äôt be positive as the sell orders will keep the price from going up.I do have a problem with the media not understanding the subjunctive verb tense and misinterpreting the FED minutes‚Ä¶ but that ship has sailed.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 08:17:54'] It tested 435, bounced off, then retested 437. Pretty much as expected.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 23:52:40'] You retard stop giving financial advice
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 23:11:35'] I got restricted by PDT but I was gonna probably do the same for my calls but idk if I should buy puts. You think if I buy some 435/436p 8/20's I'd still be good to scalp on Friday or do you think we're just gonna drill straight to that 434 line and rebound?
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 23:33:14'] Max pain for 8/20 is $436 as well. So we may not see it start moving back up until next week. 8/23 max pain is $444. 8/25 is $443, 8/27 $440.  8/30 $444
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 19:53:54'] there is no we üåàüß∏ fuck outta here with that horseshit
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 20:29:01'] So 433 calls if it drops to and bounces of that level tomorrow. You don‚Äôt think it will tank further on Friday?
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 20:45:47'] From my experience shit that‚Äôs been testing ATH‚Äôs can easily go either way. I see no technical reason why we don‚Äôt wake up to spy up tomorrow and finish at a new ATH. Or it could just as easily go down. I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb and say it finishes pretty flat. We‚Äôre do for 10+% correction anytime now tho

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 23:19:44'] This. All day this! And this isn‚Äôt just because I was an idiot and sold my spy puts early.

Or is it magically on the 18th?How does the 50 day moving average theory work with different numbers of trading days in each month depending on the fall of the weekends, but still mathematically fall on the 18th every time?18th of the month?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 18:48:41'] Nice spreadsheet & chart. What‚Äôs your investment time horizon and risk tolerance tho? That matters a lot. If you want to build a pension fund of sorts in a Roth IRA but you‚Äôre only 40 for example, you‚Äôre at least 20 years away from withdrawing any of that money for retirement income. You shouldn‚Äôt be trying to generate income that early; you need moderate-aggressive growth. ‚Ä¶oops this is WSB not r/investing, my bad
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 19:47:06'] What is Google ad revenue and how to hey it ?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 23:59:34'] You could also sell Puts on companies with low IV. You‚Äôre doing well man. You cannot pull out of a Roth IRA until 59.5 without fees obviously. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre young. Keep selling your covered calls but take a little risk you‚Äôre young you can afford it. Risk is adverse to time. The energy industry has some value opportunities I.e ten baggers. There‚Äôs plenty of value to be had. Explore all possibilities of making money on the option chain. Iron Condors, short butterflies and iron butterflies are all methods you can use to sell options to gambling degenerates. Just be careful of IV and Gamma being out of control. I think the markets will continue to behave irrationally but that doesn‚Äôt mean poorly. I think equities will keep going up. The delusion continues unfortunately. What are you invested in? Bear Market rally‚Äôs are a thing ppl don‚Äôt seem to remember. The semiconductor, energy, mining, bank/financial services and manufacturing sectors should remain strong. Im a ‚Äúvalue/growth investor. There‚Äôs not a ton of value to be had these days but growth is everywhere.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-30 17:20:41'] Congratulations. I‚Äôve done extensive DD on MRNA since they got phase 1 positive review. My target was always $100+. But I also assumed the room above 100 was limited due to the pricing pressure on their unique profitable product. I have failed to see it had a whole $60 potential on top of the $100 price when phase 3 preliminary data was out. And apparently even the majority of analysts didn‚Äôt see it either. I‚Äôve sold my stocks way too soon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 14:49:38'] I‚Äôve got to say that in most spin classes I have been to, way too much emphasis is put on high intensity intervals without proper warm up.  Idk much about Peloton workouts, but if they have participants hammering out repeated max efforts after a 5-10 minute warm up, the risk for adverse reactions increases, especially with older or deconditioned participants.  A good warm up takes at least 15-20 minutes of gradually increasing effort.

I was busy at work and check now after some hours all todays gain are gone, and it is sitting at 9.16. That is a 30% drop within few hours. There is no confirmed news, but some rumours that WHO may have asked OCGN further documentation before approval.By the way, OP, hope you managed to sell a bit when it was trading at 13.

But with $NVAX delay, $OGCN will take their market share and supply emerging markets."Would just like to point out what a collosal fail this post is. There is no Novavax delay, we just applied for EUA in the UK today. There IS, however, a Bharat delay, they got a "talk to the hand" from the WHO yesterday. Bear in mind, the WHO application has NOTHING to do with Ocugen, which does not have any sales agreements at all, much less any commercialization rights in any countries that give a flying fuck about the WHO. Lastly, you can't supply what you don't produce, and Ocugen is currently producing... nothing.So, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail. Nice job.

Then I went to options, and wound up writing sideways calls on AMC b/c Fidelity says you need experience to get options. So I missed out on getting at least $100,000.  And now I have gone back to RobinHood, which I initially passed on b/c it's impossible to set up on PC... though thankfully it finally works on PC if you set it up via ipad.  So much fucking money I've missed out on, but at least I've stayed sideways. Wakeup call to be more careful was wondering if I could get my IRA account to trade options... then I remembered that's my fucking *retirement* account, not goddamn play money, so I've backed off and missed out on nothing since. Trying to reduce my overall investments and figure out how much I can *really* afford to lose/play with versus the YOLO I got into with $40k savings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 16:15:18'] Not exactly sure how this would physically work, but if the mRNA steroid could target muscle cells to reproduce at a faster rate, then I guess it could work. And if there are no adverse side effects, theoretically this could be a good thing beyond the athletic world right?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 16:14:23'] Me thinks you don‚Äôt understand MRNA
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 17:46:25'] Right idea, probably wrong tree. There‚Äôs a chemical your body produces, or doesn‚Äôt, I forget which, that breaks down your muscle mass. Some people don‚Äôt produce as much (or more, you get the idea) of this and retain muscle mass better. They‚Äôre trying to develop a way to utilize this to help astronauts among other uses. That‚Äôs the one you want Olympics athletes to use.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 10:06:53'] Fellow Pretty Huge Dick in-training here--NVAX's vaccine is *stellar* on all metrics: excellent CD4+ response in patients, high antibody titers after second dosage, highly-scalable, and has realistic storage conditions for the developing world/ rural US. Their broad cytokine profiles are even good. This vaccine is probably the best to emerge in this entire year (I've been with them since February) and will singlehandedly save us if new strains emerge and we need annual vaccinations to keep COVID at-bay.   However, we shouldn't forget that Novavax is a *horrible company to bet on*. Also, in 3-4 months *no one will care* *about their COVID vaccine anymore;* I see this stock dropping sub-70. Follow the pump for awhile but be sure to gtfo quick and just buy shares when the price drops. Not to blatantly disagree but there won't be an acquisition--Sanofi would be the only realistic candidate to buy them out and they probably don't have the cash flow for that (and their own vaccine candidate to deal with). NVAX is on their own here.   Weirdly, I actually think there's real long-term potential for NVAX to grow in India as a flu+COVID vaccine provider with the Serum Institute. Trivalent flu vaccines are egg-based, which may not be favored amongst the stricter vegetarian populations in North India. Yes NVAX's vaccine is made in Sf9 cells (which isn't technically veg) but it can fit India's current vegetarian labelling system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian\_and\_non-vegetarian\_marks#:\~:text=Packaged%20food%20and%20toothpaste%20products,%2Dvegetarian%20and%20non%2Dvegetarian.&text=According%20to%20the%20law%2C%20vegetarian,food%20with%20a%20brown%20symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_and_non-vegetarian_marks#:~:text=Packaged%20food%20and%20toothpaste%20products,%2Dvegetarian%20and%20non%2Dvegetarian.&text=According%20to%20the%20law%2C%20vegetarian,food%20with%20a%20brown%20symbol).). I actually think NVAX bomb in the US market (unless we need annual boosters) but will be great in India's emerging annual vaccine market.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 12:12:08'] Too much to science and not enough time dedicated to the actual team running NVAX.  I will never, ever trust anything from NVAX until they actually demonstrate that they can execute.  NVAX has been around for 30+ years and has never made a single new drug.  Even for biotech, going 30+ years with never making a new drug is excessively long.  NVAX, however, once had a vaginal cream product....that they sold for a loss.  Time and time again NVAX promises the moon whenever there is an emerging public health threat.  They were supposed to delivery on a vaccine for MERS and Ebola....yet years later where are they?  NVAX constantly promotes hype for a new vax against a public health threat; the stock gets pumped; NVAX sells shares to raise cash; NVAX doesn't deliver; the stock tanks, and then hopefully by then the next emerging health threat arrives to repeat the cycle over again.  It's truly amazing how they're able to keep this company running repeating the same schtick over and over and over again.  People forget that NVAX fell into penny stock territory and was about to get delisted from NASDAQ right before COVID hit.  They had to reverse split to save the share price.  NVAX has a long history of dilutions, which was masked with the reverse split.  And here we are with COVID.  Yet again, immediately as the stock was driven on hype, management does another share offering to raise more cash.  So the cycle continues.  This is the same management, who btw, stands to reap $100M in stop option bonuses after Uncle Sam's cash infusion.  The bonuses aren't even tied to having to actually deliver a product to market.  Management will get their payday no matter what.  Somehow, someway, NVAX will eventually fuck up their Ph3 trial....it's in their blood.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 10:40:04'] Your analysis doesn't jive with your options picks. NVAX might well be the best vaccine, but that's not going to be clear by December. You're going to see the first wave of vaccines being administered, and there's no way NVAX won't tank. At the point, pick it up on the dip, with a long enough timeline for it to emerge.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 10:42:47'] This is great, thanks for the quality DD--although let's be honest I didn't read all of it. You think I'm some kind of scientist??But I agree that NVAX has a point of difference in that its other big drug being sped through approval is a flu vaccine. The fact that NVAX's covid vaccine is based on the same flu vaccine technology, is cheaper and easier to product / distribute than competitor's covid vaccines, means that the NVAX covid vaccine will be much easier to sell to a skeptical public. I believe this angle is not priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 10:51:36'] I‚Äôm reluctant to put any money into any vaccine manufacturers, whether it‚Äôs PFE, MRNA, or anyone else. Considering the enormous pressure that‚Äôs going to be on every company who develops a successful vaccine to distribute that vaccine at a low cost, there just isn‚Äôt going to be significant enough profits in it for the short-term. Add in the fact that there is at least three large companies with vaccines in the range of 95% efficacy, and I think there are much better vaccine plays than the pharmaceuticals that are developing them.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 16:21:16'] My man, some of the most lovely DD I've read on this sub.That being said, I don't see any major catalysts that would compel the ~~quacks~~ investors driving the market to pump the stock over the next six months. You mention some positive data may come from the Phase 3 trial over in London in a few weeks, but any catalyst potential is diluted given all the vaccine news being thrown out there lately. I'm not sure investors will immediately react with glee to Novavax's own version when it finally rolls out.I think the key thing here is contracts. Given everything you said about NVAX's vaccine, it's only a matter of time before local/state/federal governments realize NVAX's solution is superior by a mile. The problem is that politicians are desperate to kill this thing as quickly as possible, so they'll likely go for whatever horse comes out of the gate first. It's going to be at least a year before they realize NVAX provides the better bang for the buck.This is probably a play for the second half of next year.

Your reasoning is sound plus OPK subsidiary GeneDx  was bought out this morning by Sema4 for 685 million dollars which gives them a big cash infusion plus they still have a stake in the company that is buying them out.  If the market wasn't down over 500 points today OPK would have easily gone through 5 maybe even seen 6 but once samatragon is approved and it's already been approved in Canada and  Australia you will definitely see it go through the roof so I agree Pfizer should jump in now before it gets there.

POST_TEXT: b"Pfizer has a TON of upside potential. Here are a few different reasons why it could go to the moon.\n\n1. As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)). Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!\n2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-12 07:42:07'] $AUPH has a best-in class Lupus treatment. They have no competition. Well, they do have competition, but their oral medication has superior results over the more invasive treatment that their competitor offers. So it's a no brainerThing is, they have very few sales (500 people getting treatment out of a potential market of 1.5 million). Due to the timing of the treatment coming of age, it is pretty apparent their lack of sales is due to Covid and lack of access to doctors. So at the moment, IIRC, they are burning through cash with no apparent way to make it up. This is probably why the short interest is so high (about 18% (edit: this number may have changed since I last looked)). As a note, a week or so ago, they went on a hiring spree for sales people (or at least, there was a screenshot of job openings that just came available). Sales people is likely their only barrier to massive growth (thing is, they would never need sales people if they were acquired by a major pharma with a huge sales team, and I think they know that)IIRC, according to patent filings, they don't have a pipeline worth mentioning. A buy out is their only option. $35-$45 per share are the speculated buyout numbers. In fact, as history tells us, companies like this are designed and built for buyouts. I can't imagine any way they'll get BO by monday, or even this week. Maybe in 3-4 monthsThey had a fake buyout announcement a week ago which seemed to have driven the stock price from $14 to $20. They have a ton of short interest so OP's post makes sense to me.This is just informational, and is all publicly available information that you can get from reloading twitter then reading filings. I'm not an advisor or even know what I'm talking about.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-30 17:57:29'] NVAX price analysisThis stock is extremely undervalued for the following reasons. Ill go into detail1. 2 billion annual production capacity2. 1.7 billion in contracts3. Lower efficacy for SA strain means people will need a booster every 6-12 months4.  mrna strains will not be able to provide boosters for multiple strains at once like novavax5.  Novavax is only company in world to test a flu/covid combo in a phase 3 trial (UK)6. Nanoflu will become the market leading flu vaccine7.  The potential for an annual flu/covid booster is enormous.1. So the first one is pretty straight forward.  8 manufacturing facilities in 7 countries including the massive facility at serum institute.  Serum Institute expects it to cost about $2 to produce each dose.2. Novavax has contracts with US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, EU, India, Israel, Philippines, and all poor/middle income countries via CEPI.  about 1 billion of the annual doses will be sold via cepi for a profit of .50 a dose.  The other billion are close to $16. cost on those may be closet to $4 a dose and a portion of those are partner shares via japan south Korea.  lets say 700 million with $12 profit and 300 million with $6 profit.  Thats .5 Billion plus 8.4 billion, plus 3 billion.   11.9 billion annual profits for the best in class vaccine...3. The lower efficacy was actually good news for vaccine manufacturers as it means demand will be perpetual (like flu) as vaccine companies will need to protect against different strains. (as a result of the JNJ and NVAX data JPMorgan increased their expected covid vaccine market size4. Going forward, the mrna vaccines are at a disadvantage in responding to multiple variants due to the side effects.  They are unlikely to be able to increase dose size as demonstrated by all Moderna phase 1 participants getting very sick with the high dose(100% had fever over 101).  novavax went with their 5 dose instead of 25.  Both were safe and equally effective.  This means novavax could easily give a booster for 5 variants.5. 400 participants were tested with a flu/covid combo in uk trial.6  often forgotten is Nanoflu which beat the market leader in head to head phase 3 comparison for all 5 flu strains.  Flu market is 4.1 billion for over 65 and nanoflu is positioned to capture a large portion of that.7. So um who isnt going to want a flu/covid booster? This is why Ra capitol invested early.  They saw the potential.  Who wouldn‚Äôt want the best in class flu and best in class covid vaccine combined??  This is going to be HUGE..........So in summary we‚Äôre looking at 11.9 billion in profits... before even talking about income from nanoflu or the future covid/flu combo which is going to be the most demanded vaccine in history.  We now know there will be annual boosters needed due to reinfection rate seen in nvax and jnj trials as well as the new strain being less effective.  Other future strains are bound to happen and will also require different boosters.11.9 billion times 20x PE is 230 billion... Thats a stock price of 3570... even before accounting for increased sales from nanoflu/covid combo.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-29 05:53:11'] congrats man. You were absolutely right. I have been long $Nvax for the past 6-8 months and your posts were awesome to read.Do you think the media and " experts" are  talking more about Moderna, J&J, Pfizer compared to Nvax.Was disappointing to see today J&J get more coverage than Nvax.End of the day NVAX and MRNA shares are up north of $210 as I post this.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-29 05:43:22'] Following you since your 1st post, excellent write up. I wish NVAX led with the 95.6% headline instead of the 89.7%, media woulda picked up on the fact that it had the best results out of any vaccine. I hope they get the international coverage they deserve. Excited about the coming weeks. Is there any news/updates in regards to their flu+covid vaccine? Is that something still being worked on?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 22:10:19'] I did a find on page and it found zero results for GME. What is this?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 22:29:02'] I like the story on MRNA and BNXT long term because their cancer vaccine and other "Target random stuff" vaccines seem really potent as applications.  Was some very compelling news on these recently around the BNXT MS trial as an example... But NVAX is pretty low market cap in comparison.Thinking maybe it's buy NVAX, then also buy MRNA and BNXT when they dip on JNJ news as long-term biotechs.Good write-up, surprised their efficacy was this good because the animal studies looked less obviously good in comparison, but it was a little apples to oranges, hard to be certain.You should put rockets in your post and mention that people getting covid vaccinated increases GME's outlook.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-28 23:51:03'] I first bought into NVAX during their RSV trials when I was in college. I'm an autist so I held through failed trials and so many offerings and the reverse split. But I added in January-May 2020, and while it's not a large position by any means, I'm so happy to see their platform finally recognized between flu and covid. I hope they find a way to tweak their RSV vaccine, because I'm still in it for saving babies, even if helping save humanity is a nice side hustle.Thanks for this post üíéüôåüíéüôåüíéüôå

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-31 09:55:59'] Fantastic analysis!   The need for a multi-valent vaccine is now coming into focus.  I'd like to see Novavax develop a trivalent consisting of original covid strain and the SA and possibly Brasil variants.  No way mrna vaccines at 100ug/dose could formulate a trivalent without inducing severe reactions.  They would have to develop separate vaccines for each strain.  Their manufacturing is already max'd out and can't meet the current demands.  How the hell are they going to handle 2 additional vaccines?  Additionally, the cost would be astronomical.     Novavax is positioned beautifully here.  They could create a bi, tri or quad in their sleep.  Hopefully they keep expanding on manufacturing - they're going to need it.Hope you keep posting - great stuff!

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 19:05:53'] Yea I work for mgm resorts in Vegas. Occupancy rates on the weekends are 50-60%, but during the week we're at 17-25%. Its going to be a really rough quarter. This is generally our slow season, but we get through it with a handful of good conventions in October and November, then rodeo in December. The week between Christmas and New Years is generally our biggest week to recover from the slow period, bolstered by tourists coming mainly from Europe and Asia. All those conventions are gone, New Years Eve celebration is cancelled, and I don't see us having that travel into the states from countries that are also locked down. We always look forward to January and February, as those are traditionally our biggest months bolstered by some massive conventions, including CES, but those are gone too. March is usually great due to a few conventions+ March madness.So really, our turnaround might happen in March if March madness isn't completely canceled, and we start to see vaccine distribution in late spring, though I think it will be mid summer at the earliest.The one thing that MGM does have going for it, it went with an "asset lite" strategy over the last few years, selling the physical land and buildings that the hotels and casinos to a reit, while retaining operations of the casinos. So the MGM has a TON of cash on hand to ride out the storm. Even so, I've been perplexed by the recent upswing in ticker price. Just my two cents.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 18:06:27'] I generally like the play.  I had LVS shares and calls but got out a bit too early when it crossed $52.  Because it's changing its focus to Singapore and Macau and trying to sell Vegas I don't want to buy puts for the slight dip it will likely take on the inevitable pullback, but MGM remains a stretched company that was just starting to re-org when Covid hit.  Horrible, horrible timing for them.A couple of things to consider:  There will likely be a stimulus pop.  Maybe more than one.  The Presidential contest becomes less important by the day and members of Congress know that they're all being blamed for inaction.  Believe it or not, they're sensitive to that.  Both parties.BUT, I think you're missing a bigger downside catalyst:  Conventions.   Vegas makes its money on convention traffic.  The holidays you mention that they're going to lose are gravy.  They're going to be missing the main course for almost another year.Conventions have long lead times for planning/logistics of all involved.  Most of the big ones have cancelled into next summer.  Even if everyone is vaccinated by April, I doubt you really see conventions come back full force for over a year.  Zoom will replace a lot of this corporate expense.I'll start watching for an entry point for puts (and for my comfort level, a little longer time horizon).  Good write up.   Best of luck, and thanks.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 16:53:10'] Normal people AND austistical people would typically concur with your DD.  But what you haven't factored in is the fact that stationary bike companies are trading at 900 PE and PFE is trading less than 5% above pre announcement levels.  You can't use your type of logic for DD.  We are a bubble nation for as long as bubbles last.  The only way your bet works is if everything crashes in which case there exist a boatload of other stocks that will fall harder than a vegas casino.Either way, best of luck Comrade.  I hope your positions prove me wrong :D
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 18:11:53'] Lol this is great and you went balls deep into your position, bravo.I just wanna add that the market seems like it's simultaneously forward-looking but also overreacts to things in the short term. It kinda fucks with my head, but I agree that things appear to be a tad too bullish about our recovery prospects. This already happened once back in June, when the initial outbreak started to decline. Medical experts already anticipated worsening conditions in the Fall/Winter, but it didn't matter until it did.I suspect Covid has already mutated into different strains at this point and I wouldn't be surprised if the vaccines end up being about as effective as the flu shot is, which could dump its efficiency down into the 40-60% range.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 18:54:02'] The problem is - markets are forward looking. If they believe in 6-months from now, we will have widespread vaccine adoption and world returns to normal, then the argument would be that MGM is cheap relative to its pre-COVID levels, particularly given interest rates are currently at 0%
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 19:44:30'] HLT and MAR are my preferences if I had to short hotels.  They rely more on business travel and have big international exposure.    Business travel is basically dead and will remain dead due to safety issues and cheapskate corporate budgets. That being said HLT seems to have some very high levels of money backing it like Saudi sheikhs who can afford to throw a few hundred million at it.  But the government (federal) loans all expire on 12/31 and then these hotels will be forced to go draw down their credit lines.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 20:00:58'] I agree with this and exited my MGM position at 40% profit when it hit $25 earlier in the week - i agree it seemed totally premature. I don‚Äôt do options, but i love your put, good luck dude

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 18:00:31'] MGM has trash management but they live on as too big to fail. I was there the last time the idiots tried to bankrupt the company. Harry Reid saved them from the banks that time. A break up of the near monopoly would have been healthy for Las Vegas. It‚Äôs stagnated because everybody pegged themselves to the biggest player. If you attempt to compete with them they take out massive a loans to buy you out. Mandalay Resorts or whatever it was called is an example. While I support your position and it may succeed don‚Äôt stand still long. Their dad is the government and it‚Äôll burn you.  Daddy government makes sure they are safe while they play casino on the Strip.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 15:04:25'] lol people still bitching about middle seat restriction being removed, on their flight to Cabo for vacation.. LMAO.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 15:40:12'] Haha, looking at UAL and that sad little bump from the 30s to the 40s...Having said that, if you want to do recovery plays you should be picking...let's just say probably Q2 comps. Wall street loves comps, it doesn't matter how low a base it's off of. If UAL, for example, can have 600% up in Q2 2021 compared to Q2 2020 you'll be looking good.Some of the timing will depend on how fast the vaccine is. PLaying it "safe" you could try to get leaps for like Nov of next year.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 16:10:57'] Vaccine has been priced in for some time.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 16:38:18'] My 1/15 AAL calls looking like ass.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 16:52:34'] Did yall miss the 15-20% runup in the past month?  WSB really is late as fuck to everything.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 17:00:52'] Isn't that boom supposed to happen if they get america vaccinated before summer 2021???? This is overambitious at best
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 17:18:53'] Don't expect much when you're playing the rich man's favorite game.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 17:30:10'] The market is forward looking recovery always precedes in the market before reality when the vaccine results were announced it was known that it was a foregone conclusion how it was going to go over the next one to two months so all that was priced in in November any initial run-up
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 17:31:34'] The pandemic recovery plays have all given up the easy meat they are all good stocks to hold if you're looking to hold something for a year and get another 30% which is a good game but that's not how this subreddit works
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 17:48:00'] I got leaps and still fucking annoyed. Lost most of the gains on it still up baby amounts though...
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 17:59:50'] Just buy tsla
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 18:05:48'] When will you people learn that large cap companies don't explode? LUV, DAL, AAL, or any of the big players *have* exploded. Air travel is at basically nothing and most of these stocks are only 20-25% below their pre-COVID highs. The only good play here is leaps on DAL.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 19:34:49'] You too huh!
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 20:06:58'] No ones flying for business at the same levels of ore covid again
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 20:18:16'] There will be tendies. You just came a little prematurely, that's all.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 20:28:22'] Patient with $JBLU (cheap) and $ALK
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 20:58:10'] AAL $25C 5/21 &#x200B;I'm not selling
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 21:17:25'] What happened to the vaccines company price are going opposite direction
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 23:17:15'] The market is forward looking that shit was priced in a bit when it was rumored, fully when it hit the news. Fucking retard would buy after it becomes confirmed news
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 23:20:49'] It'll be at least four months before most people can get vaccinated, and probably at least a year before people are comfortable traveling and being in crowds again.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 23:24:52'] Yeah fuck that, i got out of meme stocks to play an "obviously safer" game by buying SAVE March 30c and they do me like this. I want to speak to the stocks manager!
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 01:13:26'] So they‚Äôre not going üò≠
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 01:57:40'] I keep laughing so damn hard ! i love you guys
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 03:05:38'] I'm still up 13% on IAG but I have a gut feeling that I'm gonna be holding that bag a *little* longer than expected. Rigged af
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 06:46:53'] Priced in
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 07:01:36'] There were like a month ago when the vaccine was announced. Made a pretty penny on JETS myself üòã
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 07:08:36'] New to WSB, what is tendie?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 07:39:32'] I browse /r/all, I see all the memes from diferent subreddits and none of them come close to this sub. You motherfuckers are hilarious
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 08:43:20'] Not yet, everyone is too busy being in hospital, try in 6 months
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 09:15:27'] Airlines have been flat for decades. Corona just triggered long time holders to cash out. It ain't going to rebound now that people are now getting accustomed to saving money, endless hassle and getting groped by TSA by not traveling for the holidays and just doing regular video calls with family and businesses get more accustomed to remote work avoiding costly business trips.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 12:36:53'] *0.1% of people gets vaccinated*Airlines: Holy shit guys, Corona and social distancing is no more, rev up the fleet!!!
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 18:43:00'] Market rallied like 4 times on vaccine news, today was just a trap for retail traders who didn't think it was already thoroughly priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 12:30:25'] If you have airline calls that expire before June or July ... I just gotta ask, what kinda stickers do you have on your helmet?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:12:53'] This has to be satire. You expected price movement on airlines based on vaccine distribution?? Jesus fuck I don't even feel bad about calling you guys retards anymore. This is actually pathetic lmaooo
