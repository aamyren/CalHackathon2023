	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 17:45:21'] Monkeypox seems to be nearly 100% preventable (unlike Covid, which required strict compliance with mitigation measures to prevent the spread).So I can't imagine there is going to be anywhere near as much crazy amounts of money flowing to pharmaceutical companies for it. Yes, it's bad, yes a treatment needs to be found, but with Covid, you have every government in the world paying tons of money to the pharmaceutical companies for it.  With Monkeypox, there isn't going to be enough spending on it to even put a dent in the budgets of pharmaceutical companies.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-01 20:55:23'] if you really think it will be red tomorrow (which you cant know) then go for it.  Buying puts in a bullish market is hard and pharma is bear resistant.  Someone advised not buying on the uptrend - that is completely wrong.  That is when puts are cheaper, and if your underlying thesis is correct (that it will drop) you will be good.   Your "feeling" that it will drop is the big big risk here.

POST_TEXT: b"Johnson and Johnson spun off its consumer division with Kenvue's IPO yesterday and the new company has a market cap of around $46.5 billion.  JNJ still holds roughly 90% of the shares of Kenvue worth around  $42 billion with plans to distribute the shares to existing JNJ shareholders sometime in September.  $42 billion in value translates to around 10% of JNJ's market cap.  In my mind theoretically JNJ's stock price should drop by 10% upon distribution similar to a normal dividend.  I don't believe they have set a specific date for the distribution but I would assume that options pricing should reflect a 10% hit in the September/ October expiration but it doesn't appear to.  I'm assuming this means I'm missing something - any ideas or insight into what I'm not seeing is much appreciated."
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 07:30:21'] The options will be adjusted so that they represent the same value after the spinoff as before; e.g., the deliverable might be changed to something like 100 JNJ Shares and 90 KVUE shares.[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/exchange\_operations/#wiki\_option\_adjustments.3A\_splits.2C\_mergers.2C\_special\_dividends.2C\_and\_more](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/exchange_operations/#wiki_option_adjustments.3A_splits.2C_mergers.2C_special_dividends.2C_and_more)

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-28 06:30:52'] I'm fairly bullish on PFE long term. However, i would sell those calls at open Monday. Its ran up very nicely and IV is incredibly high. Make some money, chill, wait for a dip and lower iv and reassess. However, the flip side case is omicron is resistant to current vaccines and has contagious levels like delta and price continues to run up due to need for new vaccine booster and treatments from Pfizer antiviral cocktail. If you think that possibility is strong, hold them. I don't as the most likely scenario is omicron is more of a lateral mutation.Sell some, hold some.

We can still sell to close, but cannot open any more of these contracts. What I don't understand is how hard it'll be for me to close these options. The cost basis is all weird now in robindhood, and I'm scared low volume with these special contracts will make it hard to close out. I'm still bullish, but should I sell now and reopen new legs with regular PFE chains? Right now it's showing that I'm up or breakeven on the premium...PFE1 37c 3/19PFE1 38c 1/15PFE1 39c 1/14

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 09:56:17'] I had 25 Pfe calls before the spinoff i had jan 50 calls and july 55 calls before it changed to pfe1 they were up now the jan calls are down and july are up a little still. i sold half just today cause i finally looked up what some people were doing and re bought the july 50 calls instead. The spinoff killed the January 50 calls and they took those off of PFE options chain and 55 july too. The bid and ask is weird as well i guess certain brokers let people buy these options without the restrictions some other brokers do, cause when i look at the jan 50 and july 55 calls they are still getting volume everyday. Many people have said liquidity will be an issue which is why sold half of them but i bought them cheap so i still dont know if i should hold till expiration.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 19:46:22'] I can't answer your question because I am new to options. I've lost for the most part due to listening to online advice. Not here but youtube. I'm proud of myself on how well my pfizer calls that I pulled outta my arse for no good reason other then I was tired of losing and decided to do something on my own. I'm calling it beginers luck. So not trying to Jack your thread. But I thought you all could tell me what to watch for and maybe the op will be encouraged. Please don't laugh I've not made that much. Lol.I bought the 38 call on 4/1 for $40 expiring 5/21 it's now worth $184. And another $38 call on April 14th expiring April 30th it's now worth $164. Edited to add I paid $29 dollars for the call expiring on the 30th of April. I know not like a lot of people's options going to the moon but hey I feel like I'm in orbit with these. I'm watching them everyday because I'm not losing on these. First sign of a malfunction while in orbit and I won't be putting them down on earth rather directly in my bank account.

POST_TEXT: b"So recently I felt Pfizer had been under valued for quite a while (mostly due to pandemic more than chart) and so I figured it was due for a correction. I wanted to capitalize on this but am extremely new to options with a small account of 500. So I purchased a call option 4/16 exp. with strike of 34 halfway through the moderate rise of yesterday for 1.15 premium. Since then it's gone tp 1.35. I think it's got a bit more room to grow and think the stock could see 37 by end of week, assuming Powell doesn't screw me. But seeing as I'm a new trader to options I've got fears for value of option because I'm not fully confident the Greeks won't set me on a tumble if I have a bad day.  With a current gamma of .1364 and Vega of .0468 how should I expect these to affect pricing as time passes? Assuming it goes how I think it will, how can I calculate expected returns? Is there a formula I can use? Thank you and sorry if my post doesn't fit all the rules, i don't know who else to ask."

I am going to try to break this down as simple as I can since I am paraphrasing from the free-education section of the Discord I run.\n\n1. Find the stock or ticker.

I just finished reading Stan Weinstein And have started using his methods for stage analysis using the weekly has really changed my mind set and confidence trading. Had helped me figure out my SL better and setting targets so using Bracket orders for my Long plays my options I keep a daily eye on them. Also just finished studying the importance of Risk Management and position size and understanding better that the risk is essentially entry and stop (for the best part) not utilizing this screwed my long positions last year. But my options returned +60% so time to be as diligent as I am with my options. Really like posts like this where I see I'm in part doing most things in a correct manner. Again great post and greatly appreciated.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 17:46:23'] Ok good analysis on whether a company has value or not, but fundamentals should look at “is the intrinsic value of the company and future cash flows greater or lesser than its current equity value”. XYZ can be the greatest company in the world and there is still a stock price in which it’s not worth investing and visa versa. In a market that’s so inflated, I would recommend looking at EV/EBITDA multiples or some other valuation metric in addition to pure price to identify support/resistance levels. And congrats on the success!

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 17:44:53'] Thanks OP for posting this. It gave me a chance to research how to add SMA indicators on trading view. I was able to modify an existing indicator to use. The question I have is if the 100/180 is the resistance line, does that indicate time to buy puts? If so, should those puts also be for 100+ days?

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-17 17:31:21'] I agree with #1, but number two gets a little murky.  Fundamentals matter, valuations matter, yes.  But sentiment matters and short term changes, especially for options, matter.  I love looking at the thought and research that goes into what you do.  I’m jelly of your diligence. However sometimes it’s best to see what others do and follow the money and remove a lot of this investigation out of the equation. Whale trades and tracking what other large funded investors are betting on makes it a bit easier to sift through the garbage.  FYI.  I only play in 30-45+ to expiry and don’t gamble on shorter term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-20 08:15:49'] Thanks for the detailed post.  I read it with interest as I am short ZIM and long PLTR so we definitely have different lines of thought. :)  I'll share my thesis for anyone interested.I can't post charts in a reply which would help illustrate my thinking, but ZIM I've been short since September at 60.20, and MATX as well.  Yes looking at FCF and revenues at the moment look great, but my thinking was more in line with what we saw with PTON, ZM, TDOC selling off as they were temporary long covid plays to begin with and financials looked great only while the markets they drive revenue from are strong.  Markets are forward looking so current FCF is less important for stock price than future financials, which is what I'm speculating on reversing, where I believe you are speculating on a continuation.ZIM/MATX financials are up because the underlying market of shipping is going through a once in a lifetime supply chain issue making for bidding wars for containers to get on ships and the companies to drive more revenue from that.  If you listen to the earnings calls you can hear their CEO's and CFO's discuss the issues.  You can actually graph the correlation with shipping if you look at things like the Baltic Index or want to track shipping freight costs here [https://fbx.freightos.com/](https://fbx.freightos.com/)  The inputs to shipping costs (fuel, labor, etc) have not increased substantially which you can see in a historical chart of operating expenses and COGS, thus with increased revenue they get higher EPS which has been on a tear lately.  Many of the freight analysts I've heard have suggested after Chinese New Year in February they believe pressure will start to relieve as supply chain issues normalize.So in my mind, the shipping industry is reaping temporary rewards of a bidding war in ocean freight which is driving their top line growth, but I don't think that will last as supply chain issues will inevitably get sorted out over time, thus bringing down ZIM/MATX revenue.  At least that's my operating thesis on the trade.In my view, the major risks from the short side are whether ZIM/MATX use their larger than normal cash reserves from their windfall profits to keep on doing buybacks (MATX has started) or figure out a great ROI way to deploy that capital to continue earnings growth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 18:55:33'] Seems a bit questionableWouldn’t surface-level stuff like company cashflows already be priced in? As you said, “that’s what big name institutions are gonna look at right off the rip”. Those big name institutions have exponentially more capital than you and I. Many of them also have high-level supercomputers. By the time you and I are looking at large company’s cashflows, those cashflows have already been looked at and invested upon by big funds. As a result, companies with good cashflows will have a share price reflecting that informationThe same argument applies to investments in “companies that will always be around”. Again, you even acknowledge that “big investment companies know this and will always buy these stocks no matter what”. When they buy those stocks, the price goes up. End result: the information is already priced in And the same argument applies **again** to your technical analysis. **Again**, you explicitly say that “heavy/smart/big investors load in when the stock hits the SMA”. When they throw their billions of $ in capital into the pit, the price moves. By the time us average joes get a piece, *it’s already priced in*It’s true that markets tend to grow over time. So we can still profit on securities despite so much already being priced in. But you used the word “print”, and I doubt that’s likely to apply. You’re trading solely based on basic info that, as you acknowledged multiple times, the whales are already aware of. How could a strategy like that be consistently “printing”? Modest profit, sure. We live in the world’s best economy; you have to trade like shit to not modestly profit over the long term. But “print”? I’m very skeptical I will admit, I am new to finance. I’m open to whatever criticism you may have

POST_TEXT: b' So I missed out on calls for Pfizer and Moderna. Looking for some green with the remaining vaccine opportunities.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 12:21:22'] JNJ is an interesting alternative. On the plus side, it could get a bump from its vaccine test results. On the negative, JNJ is embroiled in opioid lawsuits. You can get unlucky and hit one of those lawsuit news updates that tanks JNJ. Although in October they paid a billion for a get-out-of-jail-free card, so maybe this isn't a problem anymore.AZN is an ADR, so it has some outside-of-US risks, which could be good or bad.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-21 10:20:45'] Well I'd sell calls with expiry after the vaccines hit. I saw that this sector in particular has lagged the market. When the news hits, it'll be about side effects and how shitty people feel with the vaccine... fever, fatigue and bodyaches probably a death or two. There will be no big news on lives saved. It'll be a slow decline in hospitalization and deaths and unclear if it's just because it's springtime or widespread vaccination. It will be the latter, but that's not what the news will be. This, IMO, will be a very big "buy the rumor, sell the news" opportunity. YMMV. I'm staying away from this sector.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-08 14:09:17'] Are you saying that the EOM pediatric patent expiration will dump the PFE price?So, just going to throw it out there that there is already plenty of generic sildenafil on the market already.  Plenty.  And all of them  make 25mg, 50mg, and 100mg versions.* TEVA has been pushing it since 2016 (PFE patent expired outside of US prior to extension).* 2018: Aurobindo, Rubicon, Torrent, Hetero V, and Amneal were approved,* 2019: added Mylan and Lupin to the listYou can get it quite cheap through GoodRx and plenty of these e-companies (Roman, Hims, etc.) already sell a metric shitload for cheap.  I don't know that any of my patients that take Viagra for lifestyle reasons take brand name V, either;  most take generic as the price is about 90% cheaper, or have switched to tadalafil (longer half-life means larger window for boom-boom time).  Obviously when you get into Revatio for pulmonary hypertension, the upcharge is a bit more in the clinical sphere, but still, generics abound.  I think the returns on this have been diminishing quite a bit already, I don't know that any new pharma generics will drive down the price that much more (around $10-12/mo for 30tab of 20mg through GoodRx).Disclosure: I hold no positions in PFE, no options nor longs. I'm a better clinician than I am a market person, so do with this info what you will.   If I misunderstood, then just ignore my post.

POST_TEXT: b'Ive made and continue to make mistakes trading options, but every mistake makes me better and helps ensure I take a step back and dont get complacent. Ive committed to posting regularly to save others the pain of losing if I can and to help cement what Ive learned in my own head. I hope this post helps. Its not at all meant to show off, as Ive traded sideways in this IRA account for several months now, but recently changed strategies and they are working despite a little pull backs the past couple days. \n\n**Buying & Selling Pfizer**\n\nTheres been a lot of headlines about Pfizer lately, most of it very good news. So its not surprising that the stock has been moving up. But its wildly undervalued in my opinion. Prior to Covid, the stock was trading around $38 per share with about 50B in revenue. Last quarter alone they did $24B in revenue with sales boosted by the vaccine sales. Not only will this revenue trend continue, but they will be adding capacity to sell 21 million doses o'

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 07:07:03'] If you can explain to us the volatility of volatility works (what you’re actually trading when you use vix options as your “hedge”), how the vix futures curve works (and why you chose your corresponding expirations), and the beta vs idiosyncratic risk of your underlying stocks that you are trying to protect against…then maybe we will agree you’re “hedged” with those options. Otherwise, you’re just gambling more on top of your already speculative options trades and pretending it’s a real hedge.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 05:52:58'] Thank you for the detailed post! I like the way you've laid out everything in a way that's pretty easy to understand. If you're up for it, consider a blog where you track this month over month for the long term. I also like that you seem to be focusing your options strategy around long-term fixtures for the most part (your earnings gamble on VISA notwithstanding). Having said that, I'm also on board with the others here, post up after a few months even if it doesn't hold up! One month is not enough of a data sample to say that your strategy is solid.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 09:47:03'] I finally bought a pair of Crocs and I absolutely love them.It's my pandemic shoe wear.What do you think about long-term calls on Visa? Given how it's been beat up, would that make sense?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 12:47:55'] PFE is certainly undervalued. But, it's been that way for years. Pre pandemic and during the pandemic. Remember when they were the first to announce the vaccine? The stock went up by @10% if I recall correctly then gave up some of those gains. A nice gain to be sure but you'd think announcing that you have the cure to the plague would make a stock skyrocket. It's just never been a huge mover.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 17:10:36'] I’ve been adopting the strategy of buying LEAPS with a +1% to +4% Break Even (over current price) at expiration. **But, I’ll sell the LEAPS ASAP** This allows for a quicker compounding of my returns. **For example**, on 10/22 I bought APPL JAN 21 $150 strike calls (kinda short for a leap, IK) and sold them on 11/08.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 05:38:35'] Keep in mind that the Dow was sub-34K at the end of September and it peaked at 36.4K.  (So that's a 7% gain if you just had a Dow index fund.)Just because a particular strategy works when the market has a great month doesn't mean it will necessarily work when the market has a sucky month.

You are just lucky - selling puts at what you believe is the beginning of the end of a pullback is a great way to get wiped out - also you state tactics without backup - graphs ,trends , how you analyzed resistance pointsEven on your put philosophy  - was is cash covered ? Naked , sell write? I’m sorry I hear a lot of lucky punch bragging, but not much science to back it up
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 06:49:05'] Reactions to this post are not particularly surprising with many claiming, "tell me again in a year" or "you're just gambling". I take a distinct perspective and have achieved equivalent results to that of the OP. What I think your take-away from this post should be is the following.  There are opportunities and strategies for significantly above average returns and those opportunities and strategies can be identified and acted upon. There is no reason a percentage of one's investment portfolio, cannot be allocated to strategies that seek to achieve those above average returns. Also, if you are not seeking those opportunities and learning about those strategies you are doing yourself and your financial future a disservice.

I made 200% on Nvidia leaps, but I just happened to get super lucky with market timing because the stock and general market had a "blow off top" move, and I decided to take those Nvidia profits on the 8th (again, lucky with my timing). Bottom line here is to don't think you're some kind of genius because you went long a month ago.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 08:06:58'] Good work. Can’t help but notice some of your strategies are largely based on predicting price movements “near the end of a pullback”. “Hold until price target” etc.  which is a rare skill and hard to replicate.  Also wonder if the Pfizer analysis is a little overconfident. You mentioned stockpiling by governments as a bull signal. Be aware that this could lead to a very sudden and dramatic loss of revenue if demand drops, because the excess portion of oversized stockpiles will become part of the supply. Thanks for sharing, good luck

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 20:32:20'] I just scanned the post. The title should have been "5 things that worked". :)I'd recommend one strategy that seems repeatable. That is selling the PUTs the the stock that you are bullish on which has recently seen a downturn. This results in higher IV and you get more premium. When the stock moves up, you not only the get DELTA worknig for you but also lower IV.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 03:44:57'] Very good post OP. I'm following a lot of these. Let's be honest, Fastly is basically a scam.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 04:37:19'] Im praying for an earnings miracle for DKNG. I bought the $45 nov 19 call a month or so ago when it was quite ITM. It's done nothing but drop since then. Ive sold few calls against it and lowered my break even but I'm down 60% on it right now. I could have sold last week for a much smaller loss when it had that big premarket pop, presumably on the Entain news but it fizzled out by the time the market opened and I really kept thinking the earnings run was coming any minute. Wrong again.  My final move was to sell the $52 nov 19 with a final break even share price of $51.70. I bought the ticket, I'm taking the ride.

Last report date was 2 Nov with the earliest news I found on 18 Oct. This tells me they likely already took the hit in eanrings on the news last quarter but if they didn't sell those properties in the past three months,  then they could drag down earnings.

I hold 500 shares in ACB but im tired of wasting time and money in it.

Also, news can greatly effect a stocks price but I would like to think the recent incline in price is mostly due to increased revenue and volume….

It's going up now so you're buying calls on inflated premiums. I just sold mine off today. It's almost guaranteed to fall a few percent in the next couple of weeks, and come back up once they approve it for children in Oct/Nov/early 2022. We'll get more news about that in the coming weeks.It helps to pay attention to the news with regards to companies you're interested in, and get in before the news happens.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-23 19:11:04'] I think the reason FDA approval makes a diff is cuz companies can mandate it without legal risk.  And many will.  For instance Pres Biden announced he will now require all medicare/medicaid providers (virtually all health workers) to get vaccinated.  No implementation guidelines but that is the power of FDA approval to my mind.

The first leg is a put that I sold and it expires in January, and the 2nd leg is a put that I bought and it expires in April. I am speculating that, due to all the omicron news, the price will be   stable until January.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-12 13:45:50'] Whenever there is an option adjustment, you can google "\[ticker\] theocc adjustment" to find the OCC memo explaining it.  Here is the memo:[https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=50163](https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=50163)As you can see, the deliverable, meaning what you get if you exercise, is $10k.  Exercising still would cost you 100 x 100, or $10k, so this option is exactly ATM.  Unfortunately, exercising gets you effectively zero.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 15:20:12'] When you do a covered call you are agreeing to limit your max profit (similar to a short put, which is the same synthetically) so if you go above your strike price congratulations ! you have max profit. I would let my stock get called away and redeploy somewhere else.

Maybe you shouldn’t do that!Of course, if you roll and then the stock drops back in price, you can BTC for a profit. Maybe you should do that. Then again... now you are simply acting like a trader - which is a fine thing to do. It raises the question: is the Jan’22 call the best trade for your capital right now? I bet you say it isn’t, so...I wouldn’t do that.  Take your profit and find a new trade.

So I bought the calls back for a small profit and sold the shares.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 15:53:16'] I would consider rolling expirations, but would keep the strike the same or roll up as many strikes as I could for a net credit without going past the next monthly expiration. Depending on the stock and how long I’ve been holding it, I would either close the position for a few cents off its value at expiration (e.g. sell stock and buy call for net $20.95 credit), roll the covered call out a week or to the next monthly expiration at most (increasing strike if possible for net credit), or ride it out and let the stock get called away. If there is more than 14 days until expiration, I would try to sit on my hands until then.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 18:12:05'] For future positions - one thing I do for situations like this is instead of just taking the credit from the call sell into my buying power, I instead buy an equal (or close) amount of shares to the credit received. I'll do this every time I sell or roll a call for credit. Then if there is a large spike and I don't want to get assigned, I'll sell the extra shares (at a nice profit!) and use that money to pay for the debit when I roll up. It doesn't always work out, and in this case you might have exceeded the amount you could cash out... But it's a thing I do that helps ease the "pain" of rolling calls for a debit.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 19:52:17'] So I have a question about rolling out the options further out at higher strike price. Isn’t this assuming the stock will keep going up, which most likely won’t?
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 23:22:04'] The way I look at it is that you have X amount tied in investment till 2022. The alternate will be to take out whatever you can and look for greener pastures. Although my own thinking is that market reacted too quickly on the news. It will be months before we see meaningful impact of the Virus. So, it is likely that there is a correction.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 23:58:47'] if you are not certain about the stock and you do not believe it is currently in its fair value.. and it might fall soon.. you can take advantage of the current price instead of being assgined, by doing what so called "partial extraction strategy"so, portion of your underlying stock is sold, releasing proceeds that are then used to buy back the written calls, after that, you can buy back the stocks (raising your average stock price) then roll up & out.. or you can just sell all the underlying if you believe it is overvalued and it should drop soon.. taking advantage of the current pricegetting assigned is the worst case scenario&#x200B;good luck

Pfizer is a good long term dividend payer, but won’t move much on earnings. Covid vaccine isn’t very profitable for them, and market already knows about it. Moderna I don’t know much about, but it seems all the Covid vaccine earnings are are more than priced in. It needs another positive catalyst to go higher.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 22:08:51'] Pfizer is definitely a good call. I anticipate an upward price move upon earning announcement. Very strong fundamental with positive guidance for the summer and rest of 2021 and 2022 as well as 2023 when it planned to innovate its vaccine agent to regular consumer medication at clinics, pharmacies, and other health outlets for treating coronavirus patients in the same fashion as you would treat regular cold. Moderna on the other hand, I’m not so sure considering low popularity of the mRNA-1273 agent that may pose mixed financial guidance. Need for the Moderna vaccine might diminish in 2022 and 2023 as more people get vaccinated. May be a put on this one.  But who knows, momentum is still strong and if actual EPS loss CE short of the general EPS Consensus, it may turn around for you. But don’t despair. You could be right. These might just end up a very rewarding investment for you. Good luck & Keep us posted!!!!!

Just to scalp hoping for an upward move?You can roll it out for a credit if possible and hope for a rebound. But given how narrow this spread is I have to assume you’re being eaten alive by commissions, so I’d close it if you’re at 100% loss (that is current value is twice what you received originally thus cutting losses to 50%).In the future be more mechanical.

No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!\n2. There are still debater"
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 17:37:08'] >Gain comparison. Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%.You can't look at two entities who happen to produce similar products, disregard everything else they're doing, and simply compare market cap growth.The COVID vaccine accounts for a vast majority of Moderna's revenue - [in Q2 2021, it accounted for $4.2 billion of its $4.4 billion revenue](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial).In contrast, during the same period, [Pfizer's vaccine accounted for $8 billion of its $19 billion revenue.](https://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf)So you're comparing the 253% growth of Moderna, which has very little revenue if it weren't for the COVID vaccine, to 31% growth of Pfizer, which would've done just fine with all its other revenue streams. In other words, Moderna stock exploded because they went from having some $60 millions in quarterly revenue to $4.4 billion, while Pfizer's went from some $9 billion to $19 billion, and the stock price growth reflects that.Not saying any of your other points are wrong, just that this comparison isn't valid.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-13 18:15:07'] I agree Pfizer has a lot of upside potential. One thing to note is that Pfizer’s IV was near it’s 52 week low a few weeks ago and spiked dramatically last week. This was a big contributor to the jump in options prices. IV will probably cool off for the next several weeks then rise gradually going into earnings so I don’t think you’ll have quite the same result buying calls and I certainly wouldn’t play weeklies with calls on this one rn. Short puts/spreads or jade lizards make more sense to me with the inflated IV.I’m holding some 2023 40 strikes btw.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-13 11:15:32'] One reason we can speculate the volatility of Hershey's might go up, is that they were caught buying cocoa beans on options exchanges, trying to avoid buying from the facility set up with anti-child labor protections.1. Hershey's options purchases of cocoa beans send beans up higher 6 days ago: https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/11/22/cocoa-futures-skyrocket-thanks-reported-hersheys-trade2. None of this gets much notice, including when West African countries busted Hershey & threatened reprisal, except after the dispute is "settled" and Hershey's stock price actually ROSE for that reason 3 days ago: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-iac/interactive-ford-eastman-kodak-more.html. So far, Hershey's just sees net gains due to its bad behavior.3. But in the past couple of days, Hershey's child-labor cocoa beans buys is starting to get some attention. See this NBC article yesterday: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/the-war-on-cocoa-hershey-co-accused-of-not-upholding-sustainability-efforts-in-west-africa/2421880/Personally, I think Hershey's needs to be called out for its child labor cocoa beans buys, because it's not the first time it's been caught trying to undercut basic price controls in what is already one of the lowest-wage regions of the world, with or without child labor.  They also were called out for child labor chocolate in 2019:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/This is literally just brutally greedy behavior, because it's practically impossible to find labor that is cheaper than what these workers already make with the price controls. I'm seriously considering attacking Hershey stock on one of Reddit's forums, because they have been continuing to engage in this behavior. Stockholder activism is sometimes the only way these companies change abuses. tldr; Hershey's has been secret-buying child labor cocoa beans on options exchanges this year, and has been a problem behind child labor cocoa for years, in fact. It stock deserves some volatility right about now. This is a heads up I might post a rant about Hershey's behavior, asking for stockholder activism next week.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-01 18:53:57'] Which expiry and strike?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-01 23:17:06'] Keep in mind Pfizer has nearly a 220 billion dollar market cap and the vaccine will not move the needle for them, at all. Buying calls 10% out of the money on Pfizer 3-4 weeks out is not something you see often but I guess anything is possible in today’s world of investing where people will fomo the shit out of anything for no reason.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey All,\n\nRecently I was bullish on Pfizer with my general feeling that we are heading into favorable COVID and pharma territory. I bought some deep ITM calls (.85 delta) on Pfizer.\n\nIt seems to me if you\'re bullish on a stock, you get WAY more leverage with a deep ITM call as opposed to owning the stock.\n\nBelow is the same story I see with all my deep ITM calls. That is:\n\n\\- If stock is up, call is 2x to 4x up (in this case, stock is up 1.12% but I\'m up 6.09%)\n\n\\- If stock is down, call is 2x to 4x down\n\nCan someone explain this to me? I always here this idea that the .9 delta stock "follows the stock" but I just never see that, and I transact in a ton of different deep itm calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cygcavlv0yv61.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b64571c8cc35e8ab89fb9dcea42dd4d50da4d1b'
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 09:56:33'] That’s the leverage. It cuts both ways. If the stock drops $1.00, your option will move $0.90. Since your capital is leveraged 100:1 via call option you are going to see a much larger % decline on your position comparative to holding 100 shares of stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 09:59:44'] It mostly follows the stock as in you’re leveraged to some constant-ish multiplier over the original stock.With more ATM options your leverage is far more variable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 10:01:53'] It moves (in your example) almost 1:1 with the stock but of course your initial outlay (i.e. the capital you need to carry that position) is much less than if you had bought the stock outright. This is more evident with options that have LOW IVs because you don't have to get very far down in price from the ATM  to reach delta=0.9 so you don't need to pay that much in intrinsic (difference between current stock price and the strike price of the 0.9 delta call), giving you much more leverage in your position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 11:06:51'] almost just like owning the stock except for the part about expiration
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 12:12:06'] I switched from ITM leaps to shares for some time and ended up losing money more money - lol. I didn't like the liquidity issues I sometimes get with ITM Leaps especially if I just miss a window to sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 13:55:08'] Leverage. Say on a 100usd stock you buy a deep ITM leap at strike 50 for 51usd at 0.95 delta. Stock moves up 1usd, the Leap moves up at 0.95, hence a 1% increase leads to a 2% increase in the leap price. Makes sense, since you have 2x leverage. Buy it at 70, assuming delta is like 0.85 and you have roughly 3x leverage.So delta is always relative to the option price (100stocks) and the stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-26 20:35:18'] I work in the Healthcare field and was quiet involved with the vaccine allocation in my area. Moderna/Pfizer have been used interchangeably based on what is available. Like you said it's a 2 part injection process.Working in the hospital, we are trying to find a way to be able to inject admitted patients and ensure they come back for the 2nd dose (as of now its just staff only). I am more than certain almost every health institution has the same concerns. The vaccine we do have are highly coveted and waste is not an option. The JNJ vaccine will help cease those concerns. One shot, as of now, and that's it. It has a 90% efficacy, which is slightly lower than both Moderna/Pfizer; however, the one injection part is major. I can see the JNJ one being used at many hospitals and even in clinics.There are risks: not sure it's effectiveness against other variants. Moderna came out and said it's vaccine isn't as effective toward the South American variant and may require a 3rd injection. Moderna has a higher efficacy than JNJ, so I'd assume JNJ is less effective toward the newer strains. I do think Moderna/Pfizer will be the main cogs overall, but JNJ will be pumping them out too based upon availability and ease. It will be the best way to get a large portion of the population vaccinated. The real winner will be the company who can make a 1x dose w/ a >95% efficacy. The CEO of Moderna said he thinks it may be an annual injection, like a flu shot. This is all TBD, but the company who can come up with an 1x shot with strong antibodies, that's the longterm play
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-26 21:04:29'] I feel like it’s priced in right now just like Pfizer was before the release.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-26 21:24:00'] The current vaccination process is a cluster esp. at the state level, and Moderna/Pfizer requiring 2 doses, plus crazy refrigeration requirements are a contributor.  I believe JNJ could be a game changer and went long myself.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 10:59:07'] I was holding Pfizer shares for 6 months and they’re still basically the same price since I sold my shares, even after the vaccine news. I don’t really see them growing drastically due to that, they’re better to buy and hold for the dividend. It’s a boring stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 10:52:11'] You have to consider the fact that Pfizer is an established company with a huge line of other products. This is why they have a 207 billion dollar market cap. Let's say with these calls you need to PFE to hit $41 to break even. This means that for this vaccine to push PFE to your desired price, it will need to generate about 20 billion dollars of profit. Remember that this is probably a product that will have one or two years of use. It is not going to generate revenue for years to come. Will it do that? I don't know. But run the numbers to see if you think that they will actually make enough to off of this vaccine to justify that kind of price increase.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 14:48:14'] I initially wondered the same, but it barely moves, even on hugely positive vaccine news. I think everyone’s comments are right, huge company, other products, etc. But still I have a hard time thinking the stock won’t move more when they actually get approved.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 10:45:12'] Sell those and buy more pltr lol. In short imo any of these big pharma companies are not going to go up much on any news. Pfizer, lilly, j&j, they are too big and who knows what they even make on the vaccine after factoring in costs. Pfizer’s vaccine storage sucks. Lilly basically has a legit treatment that can slow or stop it all together and their stock is flat. The only stocks that can rocket are the one hit wonder stocks like moderna, nvax, etc who have no revenue anywhere else but those are pure spec plays and short to intermediate at best
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 13:15:31'] They are cheap for a reason. I bought some calls above 40 a while ago and all they do is slowly bleed out and decay.

	COMMENT: ['2016-07-09 09:27:55'] I think you have a couple of misunderstandings.  A covered call is a bullish strategy.  You want tot he stock to go up.  You will still make money if it stays the same or goes down a little collecting the time decay of the short option, but it is a long delta position.Second, even if you sell an ATM or ITM strike, there is still time value left in that option and the person on the other side of the trade isn't going to exercise it since they'd instantly lose that premium.  In your example, of you sold the ATM strike for $0.51, and the counter party immediately exercised it, they's but the stock from you at $35.50, they would have effectively paid $35.50 + $0.51 for it when they could have bought it in the open market for $35.50.  The same logic holds for ITM strikes as long as there is still time value left in the option.Another way to think about it is a covered cal is identical to a naked put at the same strike.  Selling an ITM call against long stock is he same as selling a put at the same strike which by definition is OTM.  Why would someone exercise an OTM put when the stock is trading at a higher price?
	COMMENT: ['2016-07-11 04:33:43'] You will never get assigned right away if you do not open completely ridiculous positions.If you write a covered call you want to sell the stocks, you can do that ATM and get the most cash for the option, but you will probably get assigned to deliver once the stock is higher than strike price+premium, I'm more a fan of put options but you can combine those two well to get rid of stocks you never really wanted.
