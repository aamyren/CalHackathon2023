POST: ['2023-05-16 06:27:03'] POST TITLE: b'Amazon has a P/E over 250x. Can someone explain this to me?'
POST_TEXT: b"Earnings just came out, and it wasn't bad. In line with expectations. They made about $3b in profit. They obviously have a strong marketshare in cloud, and that isn't going anywhere any time soon. I can say this safely as a software dev. They could raise their prices 25% and I know that would not be enough to get the company I work for to switch to anything else. \n\nThat being said, a P/E of anything over 50x seems crazy to me. 250 would be for a smaller company, growing exponentially. What are people predicting about the future of Amazon that they should be worth so much? Their retail business is low margin, and that isn't changing any time soon. \n\nIs there some sort of expectation of exponential growth in profit? I just really don't get it. This seems crazy overvalued to me, and people just buy Amazon because it's a big name and that's it. As good as AWS is, there shouldn't be any prediction of wild growth. If anything they could lose a little bit of market share going forward. \n\nWhat"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 06:50:43'] Shows why P/E is often a poor metric. Amazon is continually spending. On R&D, content, and acquisitions. Hell, they spent nearly a billion dollars on their Lord of the Rings amazon prime show. They also acquired 6 companies in 2022. If they just cut all that out, they would drop to a P/E of ~15. But their goal is to sacrifice short term profitability for long term market share. It‚Äôs how they managed to grow revenue by 10% last year while other big tech like apple and google were in the low single digits. They‚Äôre sitting on $70B cash, so they‚Äôre adequately funded to be taking the occasional loss
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 10:36:12'] AMZN is going robotic. I wouldn't say it's value is worth \~270x P/E, but people are definitely considering that P/E will improve with earnings increases and as it does it may maintain a 270x for some time.Robots will greatly improve AMZN earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 08:22:17'] People will tell you that Amazon could cut its R&D and other ‚Äúspending‚Äù and have a pe of 30‚Ä¶ but if they did that growth would slow leading to a pe of 30 being too high..I‚Äôve never gotten a straight answer as to how it makes sense.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 07:12:31'] For Amazon, I ignore the P/E as they continuously invest and expand, not paying dividends but reinvest everything - that might explain the P/E ???.They are no1 on online marketing, no1 in cloud, now with the Prime videos, etc - on each market they are solid constant growth, nothing exponentially,. So I will buy more next month.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 07:28:55'] Amazon has a lot of profits. They just hide it well.

In the last years they have been in preetty constant ratios, generating a flat but positive (even if small) owner‚Äôs earnings on the range of $20 B a year. Considering all the above have grown a lot the logic explanation is business is expanding and r&d spent maximized. I like that üòéüëç
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 09:22:30'] Forward is 45. That's still high though. I certainly wouldn't be buying it right now and if I had it I'd be setting a sensible stop loss to take profit.

AWS is staple. Its grocery chain is still too expensive. There are several growth etfs that crashed as much as -40% from 2021 year end to now. Most attributed to weight used in Amzn and Tsla stocks.  They have never recovered yet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 04:15:06'] Everyone and his uncle is using AI nowadays. Don't get me wrong: Amazon is a great company. But before taking a position on Amazon, I would ask myself, to know if I'm paying a fair price:* Will Amazon benefit more from AI than his competitors? Compared to Microsoft Azure for example (and there are many others)?* Why would most households want to buy Alexa? Many people are fed up with large corporations intruding in their lives. Will most household want to have such a device in their home?* For those who want that, will Alexa really be so superior to alternatives, such as those from Google and Apple?* Will Prime Video benefit more from AI than Netflix, Disney or anyone else in the streaming business?* It seems households will be spending less for consumers goods in the coming months, because of rising interest rates. How will that impact Amazon?* Will AWS growth remain as strong as is has been in the current economic context?* How well will Amazon compete with Alibaba in India?If I had a positive answer for all the questions above, I would go ahead. If not, maybe I would wait to see if the stocks goes back in the 90-100$ range, or commit less money for a position on Amazon.

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 08:36:08'] I know Amazon is a behemoth, but I was still shocked to learn that 36% of U.S. warehouse workers work for Amazon.  This makes their safety record that much worse as we're talking tens of thousands of injured workers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 11:18:22'] Insert shocked pikachu GIF here
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 21:46:45'] I have managed in several warehouses and manufacturing facilities over the years, to include an Amazon fulfillment center for 10 months (left a couple years ago).  From my perspective, Amazon had the best safety culture of any company I worked for by far.  Their forklift safety, dock safety, and trailer yard safety were by far better than anyone I had worked for.  In a warehouse environment those are typically the things that will kill you.  The soft tissue or repetitive injuries are an outgrowth of the workpace and the philosophy that a manager‚Äôs primary job is to keep work in front of their associates.  Most companies want machine paced, not self paced work.  Aside from automotive companies, Amazon is one of the few companies to truly excel at it.  But it comes at a cost.  They try to mitigate the risk, but those injuries will not go away until robotics replace stowers and pickers.  I don‚Äôt think packing was as much an issue.  I also suspect their injury reporting is more complete than other companies.  Amazon as a tech company just had more resources to do things than the other companies I had worked for across other industries.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 16:14:27'] Everyone loves to shill on Amazon but at the end of the day most ppl will still utilize their services through either prime or cloud services
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 19:11:21'] I'm sure this will kill their stock value.  Short sell! They'll crash on Monday after this news gets out.  Only a small few investors care about this so not sure how it belongs in stock market page.  Every company that Suze screws up and often.  Accidents happen.  People slip and fall all the time just working retail.  A loser friend of mine broke his foot at Macy's.  Not entirely convinced he didn't fake it and intentionally break his foot for workman's comp.  So totally grain of salt.  That said I'm more worried that their retail division is dying due to crappy customer service and crappy products.  While AWS is their profit core they obviously want to be in many sectors.  They're failing in retail for many customers.  n OSHA citation is nothing compared to other issues.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 04:47:05'] Look at FCF instead
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 05:12:52'] **If you want to see whether a company makes money with its business, don't look at net income, look at free cash flow (FCF) and the cash flow statement.** Net income was negative $5.8B for the six months ended June 30, but the entire stock-based compensation for 2022 was $19.6B. FYI, stock-based compensation is treated as a cash expense even though it really isn't.Having said that, Amazon's FCF was only $7.6 million for 2022 after it paid off all of its financial obligations although they did spend a record $63.6B on capital expenditures so they are obviously doubling down on expansion.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 06:18:42'] This is a stupid post. Misleading topic, some old half-ass income statement and absolutely no context. Amazon is one of the largest and most successful corporations in the world. There are reasons their bottom line is 0 and its part of their success.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 08:47:33'] Like others have mentioned, look at the FCF. However, other things to do on this page is look for numbers that stick out. The $14.9Bn loss in Total non-operating income sticks out to me. I bet if you look further in the document where you got this you can find a one time charge that is increasing this number. So if you were an analyst wanting to find a fair value for this stock, you would want to adjust for these one time charges so you can properly forecast revenue.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 09:40:46'] I use to be in the camp of Amazon is very overvalued because large retail is low margins and they will unlikely make a large profit aside from AWS. I expect the ecommerce business to be about 3% margins but what I think a lot of people are missing is the ad business they are incorporating into their ecommerce business will be very profitable. They already have one of the most visited platforms in the world and this ad business will be extremely high margins because the infrastructure is already built.

Amazon is unlikely to face those paper losses again in future years, and Wall Street projects that Amazon will storm back to more than $17 billion in profit in 2023 by cutting costs and shedding employees it brought on to deal with spiking demand in the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We all partied this is the HANG OVER
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 20:08:28'] As history shows there is 80% chance that they will beat. In every earnings season 80% of the SP500 companies beat analyst estimates. Yeah 80%. So analysts do their job well. When market is down yoy over 20-30% they lower it to a point that companies will beat and market will rally. When the markets are up and up they have such high earnings estimates that companies miss and stocks drop. Same as it has been for at least 3 decades that I have been in the markets.

They are not appealing to lower middle class and middle class as ‚Äúthe place‚Äù to shop. Those people are pounding the pavement looking for deals in brick and mortar stores. Issue is they are meet with limited stock and bare shelves. In the end profits are only up because they‚Äôve raised the prices on everything.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 14:49:17'] As a user of Amazon to buy stuff I find the shift from Amazon selling things to Amazon being a storefront to be a major negative on my user experience. We see in the sales data that Amazon 3rd party seller revenue is up 14% but online stores are down 1%.My Amazon feed is heavily filled with ads on the opening search pages. It's so bad I downloaded a plug-in to eliminate them and it instantly made searching better. And I ditched Amazon Prime because the value just wasn't there.I can't speak for others, but Amazon has definitely reduced the value proposition of their services to me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 23:30:32'] Man, amazon trades like a tech company in low interest rate environment, but it's so capital instensive. I can't wrap my head around it, how is it valued so high when it has extremely high expenses eating into the profits.

When it comes to cloud computing:  There are any number of AI services from security, chat bots, targeted advertising, etc that Amazon maybe paying another company to do for them that eventually they can do for themselves and continue to vertically integrate.    Amazon does a lot of things, it is going to continue to try to do more things, innovate and integrate them into its package of services.

And comparable companies spend a similar amount compared to revenue, so they won‚Äôt catch up unless Amazon messes up.NVidia is purely leading edge semiconductor with less services revenue, so relative R&D will be extreme.And who knows what Meta is doing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 11:36:50'] I‚Äôd dump AFRM, BABA, Cresco, and RDFN and put most of the proceeds into your VTI position, using the rest to average down on AMZN, DIS, and GOOGL. Better advice would be to dump all your single company stocks, do a lump sum into VTI or 2-3 similar funds with half the proceeds then set the other half to DCA. Add a couple low-fee diversified ETFs if there are 1-2 fields you think might outperform if you need to scratch that itch. I was in a similar situation years ago, and I remember after I rebalanced into safer holdings the feeling that my finances were finally healthy and headed in the right direction waaaaaay outweighed the shitty feeling of taking a loss.Edit: typo

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:38:52'] Homie I hate to break it to you, but your AFRM stock may not last the decade to recover. Their financials are rough at best. Already highly leveraged, have about a year of runway in cash, and are losing money every year, with minimal cash they can raise (especially in this macro environment) without issuing stock. And to top it off their interest their paying is quickly rising.  Edit: If they had a positive macro environment ahead, I'd feel more comfortable holding, but not right now with how leveraged they are, and how high interest rates are
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:09:19'] My non financial advice would be to sell Affirm and Redfin. Baba is a gamble, I have no idea why Disney is such a turd.I have faith you will make money in Google and Amazon long term.No idea what Cresco is.Not financial advice
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 12:09:31'] Personally was in that similar position a while back and all you could do is just average down because 22 was a bad year for stocks, averaging down and picking up cheaper shares will definitely help you regain some as it goes back up and balance out your losses. Remember it's not a loss unless you sell so if you are a long-term investor you'll be fine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 16:08:14'] TL;DR about AFRM -- I really don't think it'll ever see $15.50 again let alone $20. But I don't typically short because shorts can become very surprising.But I explain a lot below why I think that. As painful as it is you'd almost be better off just taking all of AFRM and putting it into TLT or something for now. UBT (2x TLT).Not financial advice.But the psychology of "wanting a stock to go back to some price" is punative. It's not rooted in strategy, rationale or pragmatism.That stock hurt you and you want to hurt it back, you want to make \*IT\* specifically pay you back.Even while AAPL ripped 30%+ in that time.Had you just cut your losses on AFRM and put it into AAPL you'd have done better. But you want to punish AFRM for what it did to you.That's the psychology costing you money.

RDFN is probably as high as it'll go, if it didn't break out now while AAPL is almost at All time High, it never will.DIS is a turd, but it may stop shjtting itself. I really don't know. I abandoned DIS around $170 for a small loss at the time. Go woke Go broke, look at $BUD.

You can use trading strategies such as contracts for difference to reduce costs and reduce your current investment. Even if you will lose money in the end, it will not be so serious. After the exit, the decline of technology stocks will basically be stable. At this time, you can choose to buy and hold for a long time

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 19:20:52'] I would watch as many Warren Buffet videos as you can. Don't focus on what he says about what to invest in or how to value, but listen to his reasons for why. This is where you learn what he calls emotional intelligence.What is your reason for purchasing a stock? If the answer is as shallow as, to sell it for more later, then you will always be guessing and hoping your guesses pan out. These stocks could tank, they could go to the moon. For each stock I buy I have a buying statement that I save. I am buying X company because... That statement is my foundation for when and if I sell. I bought Intel at $32 on its way down, because I believe in the capex plan to increase domestic chip manufacturing and pivoting from competing with Nvidia and AMD to competing with Taiwan semiconductor. So, my foundation is no matter what the price does I'm in it until their pivot plan has a chance to succeed. I'll hold until a few years after all their new plants are built and reassess them then. Thinking that way is so much less stressful than panicking over the action of the price from day to day, and wondering if I'm smart or dumb for buying/holding/selling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 03:29:06'] Just my two cents, but if a stock is jumping (or crashing) 25% in one day that's not a good thing. It means company guidance is garbage. I'm seeing a lot of stocks going sideways and then jumping or falling huge amounts in a single day. Makes me think the algos are pushing most of this. Point is, how is anyone supposed to be able to predict huge swings like this if the companies themselves don't even see it coming (and hence why they have to make HUGE revisions to their projected sales/revenue). Nvidia was overpriced, it is overpriced, and it seems a bit silly to attack Woods because she couldn't see it being parabolically overpriced.

With such run up this would have been now my biggest position and would boost my portfolio performance vs SPY for the rest of this year if not for the next 3 years. But it is what it is.After I sold literally in next days there was a video (it was very technical, not really about stock) I watched which had very good arguments why Nvidia is easily next 1T company. The video kinda gave me same vibes like Linus video in 2017 - I still remember the episode where he was very excited about AMD Ryzen processor and said he'll buy AMD stock because of this. And I stupid looked at the price and thought, damn, but AMD so expensive at 11$ such price was only during 2000 bubble.But yea, it's all bs about "what if", should just focus on my portfolio. Until I see my REIT positions... I guess only good thing it's not so bad as Cathie Wood's stocks.

POST_TEXT: b'Amazon founder and billionaire entreprenuer Jeff Bezos has advised the American people to avoid large purchases such as new TVs, refrigerators or cars and keep some dry powder on hand during the coming holiday season as the US economy is likely to be in a recession soon, according to a report in the CNN.\n\nThe tycoon had last month tweeted to his followers to batten down the hatches. When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.\n\nHe said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession "very soon".\n\nTake some risk off the table, Bezos told CNN. Keep some dry powder on hand... Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems.'

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 08:46:46'] We‚Äôre already in a recession and judging by history, we‚Äôre approaching the halfway point. The tech bubble has popped, zombie companies are collapsing, inflation is showing signs of cooling, economy is holding up even with aggressive rate hikes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 07:57:26'] I think for the peasantry the recession has been here for a while in a  similar way to how the inflation was "transitory."The recession they are predicting is simply where a big enough mass is sure of it. It's prep for worse.

Essentially creating a situation to help himself. He does not care about us!

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 01:56:45'] I think the entire western world is headed towards recession. Especially if Sweden can provide proof, and does so, that Russia bombed the Nord stream pipeline. By law the US would label Russia a state sponsor of terror, cutting off all trade relations with Russia and any nations that trade with them by proxy. europe relies on Russia for key inputs to industry (inputs to steel copper and for fertilizer) and so Europe would have to search elsewhere for those items. Big bad.

We'll see how the holidays go...so far the American people have ignored this talk and continue to spend like a drunken sailor on leave.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 09:23:32'] Bezos can fuck off right into the sun.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 08:47:52'] Looking at various economic indicators like job openings and unemployment, we are far away from recession. Looking at stock market and housing, we are in a correction or a pullback, not a recession. This doesn‚Äôt mean that a recession can not happen. I think the point being made by experts and all is that there will be a contraction in employment, housing and stocks. No one knows if this could trigger events that would then lead to recession. Has happened in the past so possibility and probability are favoring a recession like outcome.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 09:22:44'] By the definition of recession, I believe that the economy is already in recession. But hey, governments like redefining things to suit them, so we wouldn't know until they tell us.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-21 23:40:38'] Good advice although you question when a billionaire tells you to do something. Most of us buy stuff with credit, big things like house,Student and health loans, and car, and smaller ticket items like the crap amazon sells from China. With interest rates north of 7%, and inflation already eating into our unrisen income, we are getting even less than inflation would‚Äôve taken a bite out of. Should you pay off your mortgage? NO. Unless you are in a floating rate loan that is due in a year to reset, otherwise think if it as getting money at 3 or 4%, that‚Äôs lower than inflation, that means the banks are hurting more by lending you so cheap, almost like they are paying you, since you pay less.  Instead you can invest in an i-bond and stock, and get better than 4% return, and the tax deduction on mortgage interest payments

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 20:25:51'] Here is Disney‚Äôs problem, they decided against licensing Disney content and decided to do it themselves.  Do instead of getting a royalty check each month they get more but now also get all the costs associated with running a streaming service.  So far they are not doing well.  The space is crowded and other streamers are providing better value to customers.  Unfortunately they also picked a needless fight in FL.  Agree or disagree with Disney‚Äôs stance is irrelevant, there Orlando location is a cash cow and they decided to take a stance that aggravated at least some base.  With that said, they have been dropping for awhile due to lagging profits due to poor decisions.

Even in their computer modeling, they put in numbers to get the outcome they want to see. Look at Amazon , fundamentals hasnt changed . They still doing business at usual , at $180, these so called analysts were on CNBC saying it has room to go and when you buy at that price you are basically getting AWS for free. Now these same analysts are downgrading the stock because it‚Äôs falling when their business is still intact. My appoint is, Analysts only follow the price of a stock. If it‚Äôs in a downward trend , they downgrade it. If it‚Äôs in an upward trend they upgrade it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 06:01:30'] It‚Äôs a marked reversal from 2020, when Amazon stock rallied amid unprecedented online demand. Amazon saw a rush of orders from consumers at the height of the pandemic, as many avoided trips to physical stores and turned to the web for essential and nonessential goods.    Last year, the story began to change, as e-commerce companies reckoned with tough year-over-year comparisons and the economy started to reopen, leading many people to return to physical stores. By early 2022, higher costs tied to inflation, supply chain constraints and the war in Ukraine generated further pressure on Amazon and other tech companies.

POST_TEXT: b"Hey everyone,. \n\nI want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.\n\nI'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event.

POST_TEXT: b'Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the companys share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?\n\nOne bright spot has been the companys increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivians future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% in'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 13:16:02'] My take: the interest rates went way up, making most investors way more conservative. They were in for the momentum not the products. Simultaneously the EV market by now has way more players, including the ones who have been making cars for a 100 years. The low hanging fruit are gone, and despite what Tesla told people, they're not in software they're in automotive. Looking at any kind of lists of who sells most EVs, I don't see Rivian on them.But you know, you never know..? Something for that risky part of your portfolio? In any case, I think that's why the momentum is gone at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 17:58:11'] Another thing to note that will hurt their stock price in the short term is that they are being removed from the Nasdaq 100 index. Rivian is a long term play, like decades. The EV moat is shrinking so they need to ramp that volume and hit their targets consistently in the near term. Supply chain woes have eased so they need to get cash burn under control. If that happens, then investors will return. Hell, if Lucid is still attracting investors then Rivian can get by for now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 14:40:52'] The fact they are actually selling a significant amount of vehicles is the first step to a successful company.  The fact they were briefly valued about 100x their actual value by the market at one point isn't Rivian's fault.  If their run rate continues at only the same amount of sakes as their most recent quarter, they are trading at about 5.3 times their sales.Their profitability may be held back by accounting tricks rather than actual cash burn... How much is depreciation annually on new factories, btw?  How much are they paying in stock options that count against the balance sheet but don't actually cost money?  I haven't researched them, but they are finally making progress.  Rivian's market cap may not be particularly overheated at this point.I saw one in Syracuse NY yesterday, my first sighting of a Rivian vehicle other than their website. Syracuse is not a hotbed of electric vehicles.Their sales are 2.9% of Tesla's, their market cap is 1.9% of Tesla's... Other than Tesla fanboys buying stock because reasons, why is Tesla's valuation so much higher? If they correct and meet in the middle, Rivian will be worth 25% more than it's worth right now, with no material improvement in execution.  Rivian seems to be headed in the right direction.I'm thinking about buying in...

They all have antitrust concerns, and they all had rich valuations based on huge future growth. But amazon had some other challenges that have put me off for a while. Namely their core offering kinda sucks. The quality of goods on amazon has gone down a lot. They push their own knock off brands incessantly making finding other stuff more difficult. They‚Äôre costs are getting more and more similar to every other retail. Online shopping and free delivery has become much more common. Then they tried to insert themselves in virtually every industry, which to me is not a winning bet. They would be much better actually focusing on a few core businesses than perpetual expansion, imo

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 04:20:20'] Honestly I hope he's right I bought AMZN after the split thinking it will obviously go up and now I'm down 30%. once this crap is back in the 90s in selling and buying something in the DOW.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 09:29:44'] The problem with Amazon is that a lot of their products will lose demand in a recession. Someone like Walmart will continue to sell their normal goods, even at an increased level. My opinion is that Amazon profit will continue to fall but once it bottoms it will be a real steal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 09:58:44'] Tesla can easily drop by another 30%

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 21:18:13'] I watched his interview from a day or so ago. Per Bill, the current stock price represents AWS. The rest of the business is not priced in. But like other similar services, AWS is slowing as well. I‚Äôm in as well at $99, but writing calls to make up some of the loss.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 06:39:38'] Finally Amazon is working towards Universal Healthcare. Just an additional $99 added to there monthly prime fee, call it Prime++.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 07:27:20'] One isn‚Äôt that big, but seems to have been struggling to expand. So I‚Äôm wondering if they plan on using it just for their own employees to reduce overall healthcare costs - or if they plan to keep it open to the public?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 06:10:21'] Paywall so can't read.  However, I'm curious with Amazon getting into healthcare, and Mark Cuban into discount pharmaceuticals, what's the real play here?  I wonder if Amazon is going to try to influence the market to lower prices for healthcare.  Or make things worse?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 08:30:13'] One thing amazon has done very well is to turn expenses into revenue by building a system they need and then selling it to other businesses and the public. If they can do with healthcare what they did with AWS it could be a huge expansion for them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 06:53:28'] Actually would be amazing to see a company so consumer-focused go into healthcare.People hate Bezos/amazon because he's rich predominately, not because of actual bad things he has done. That's not to say I think he or amazon are good or bad. I've heard of some bad warehouse conditions, but generally speaking amazon is amazing for consumers, and the workers in US are at 15USD per hour minimum before it was brought into law.You are going to look bad sometimes when you provide a service this big because the cost of living gets eroded by government spending and the private sector is meant to catch up with an enormous institution that is printing money rather than earning it. With the US's crony capitalism, healthcare could really do with a few outsiders, like these growth-focused consumer stocks paying attention.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 09:28:24'] Why Amazon hasn't been broken up under a monopoly clause I will never understand, how this is allowed to stand on its own is absolutely disgusting.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 08:30:02'] Amazon is a beast of a business! They literally getting their hands into so many different industries and doing very well at it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 10:35:35'] Cool cool cool... Can they give their workforce free healthcare now?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 10:46:03'] This may be only the beginning.  I thoroughly expect an acceleration of this between Amazon and Alphabet.  Between the two, they have over 200 billion in Cash and Marketable Securities as of their Q1 10Q Filings (both report Q2 earnings next week).   Disclaimer:  I currently have 500 shares each both in Amazon and Alphabet.

He also stated Lyft is not interested in being sold.  The stock market reacted negatively to this because Lyft loses money and yet thinks the solution to the problem is to become the low-fare option vs Uber.

A COVID outbreak at the facility has lead to a mass evacuation of personnel.  Video has appeared online for several days showing thousands of Foxconn workers walking along highways to return to their home towns.

The "last mile" that accounts for most of the actual work in shipping hardly needs durable packaging anymore, because the Amazon warehouse is less than 10 miles away, and a bunch of the deliveries are by part timers in hatchbacks.

Amazon is not only the biggest ecommerce platform in the world, AWS is the biggest Cloud Computing provider in the world. Neither of those are exaggerations. I don't have a crystal ball, but I have a very hard time imagining a world without Amazon or AWS.

What if the market decides Amazon is only worth 20 x? Lights outThere are countless examples of that happening in history
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 15:31:24'] Simple reason: we're in a bear market.While it seems very likely 2 years from now these stocks will be higher than they are today, nobody knows for sure.While it is possible the market is close to bottom, nobody knows for sure. The economic impact of the Fed's unprecedented rate of hikes might not be fully realized for months.Bear markets that accompany recessions typically go longer and go deeper than we have thus far. They also typically end with a volatility spike.Unless there is a catalyst I can easily see the market having at least one more leg down before a new sustained bull market begins. Best to have as much cash ready to pounce. The beginnings of fresh bull markets offer tremendous long-term opportunities.I'm all for DCA but on the way up, not on the way down.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 11:26:32'] > IT IS HARD not to be in awe of Amazon. It is one of history‚Äôs greatest companies. Jeff Bezos nurtured the firm from the humble online bookshop he founded in 1994 into a tech juggernaut, selling everything from corn syrup to cloud computing, a future trillion-dollar industry that Amazon more or less invented (see chart 1). Today it is the world‚Äôs fifth-most-valuable company, third-largest revenue generator and second-biggest private employer. Its warehouses, data centres, shops and offices cover an area almost the size of Manhattan. Consumers, competitors and politicians have been left to wonder if Amazon would take over the world. Or whether it would stop there‚Äîit is investing heavily in Kuiper, a satellite-broadband venture.>> All the superlatives notwithstanding, it is equally hard not to recognise that Amazon finds itself in something of a funk. With a downturn on the cards in America, its biggest market, shoppers are tightening their purse strings and corporate IT departments are paring back cloud spending. Amazon‚Äôs market value is down by around $1trn since its peak in mid-2021 (see chart 2), erasing all the gains of the covid-19 pandemic, when customers rushed to join its Prime subscription service and businesses were shifting their data to its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This month Amazon announced 18,000 white-collar lay-offs, amounting to 6% of its corporate workforce. When it reports fourth-quarter earnings on February 2nd its annual revenue growth may for the first time ever come in at single digits, down from 22% in 2021. In October the company warned it might make little or no profit in the last three months of 2022.>> Amazon‚Äôs Icarus moment is not unique in big tech. All its fellow tech high-fliers have been hit as demand for their digital wares declines now that people are no longer locked down at home and postmen no longer bring pandemic-stimulus cheques from the government. But under Andy Jassy, the AWS chief who took over as CEO after Mr Bezos retired in July 2021, Amazon has expanded much more aggressively than Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft (see chart 3). This exuberance leaves the company in a tough spot as it contends with three big challenges: a sputtering retail business; decelerating cash engines of AWS and a newish advertising business; and growing competition. Can the understated Mr Jassy overcome them, and turn Amazon‚Äôs sprawling empire into a dependably profitable business?> > To understand how Amazon found itself in its current predicament, go back to just before the pandemic. The firm was already planning a big expansion of its warehouse and logistics network. The aim was to offer one-day delivery for more products to more Prime members. When national lockdowns created a boom in online shopping, Amazon doubled down. In April 2020 Mr Bezos told investors: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we‚Äôre not thinking small.‚Äù> > Over the next two years Amazon doubled the size of its fulfilment network. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI, an advisory firm, calculates that Amazon added about 130m square feet (12m square metres, or nearly four Central Parks) to its global footprint in both 2020 and 2021. In those years Amazon‚Äôs cumulative capital spending reached $100bn. No company anywhere in the world invested more in that period. Last year it may have invested another $60bn, again more than anyone else. Around half that sum went on warehouses and vehicles; most of the rest on AWS data centres. Amazon also increased its payroll to 1.6m, from 800,000 in 2019.> > In the first quarter of 2022 Amazon admitted that overhiring and overbuilding were each adding $2bn to its quarterly costs, relative to 2021. Pricier fuel and higher wages meant a further $2bn a quarter. In April 2022 workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted to unionise, and called for ‚Äúmore reasonable‚Äù productivity targets and more pay. If Amazon agrees to the union‚Äôs demands, the Staten Island warehouse alone could add $200m or so to annual operating costs, estimates Morgan Stanley, a bank. At the same time, retail sales slowed; in December American consumers spent 1.1% less than the month before. Amazon‚Äôs retail losses are thus piling up. Mike Morton of SVB MoffettNathanson, a research firm, estimates that when you strip out profits from ads, annual operating losses from the retail division (plus devices, entertainment and other smaller units) amount to about $30bn.> > The ad operation itself is another point of concern. In the past few years it has gone from virtually non-existent to the world‚Äôs fourth-biggest, with yearly revenues of $36bn. Its operating margins are reckoned to be around 30%, on a par with the industry‚Äôs two giants, Alphabet and Meta. But profitability may be slipping. Amazon has reportedly splurged around $1bn for the rights to stream some American-football matches, and alongside them some ads‚Äîa fortune compared with the cost of posting banners on its own website. At the same time, year-on-year growth in ad sales has slowed sharply, to 25% in the third quarter of 2022, from 53% the year before.> > Amazon‚Äôs main cash engine, AWS, is also decelerating as business customers trim their digital budgets. Soaring energy prices, especially in Europe, made it much costlier to keep the power-hungry data centres whirring. What is more, AWS is particularly vulnerable to shrivelling orders from startups, which tend to favour it over rivals such as Microsoft Azure. As their venture-capitalist backers grow stingier amid the tech rout, the young tech firms are slashing their cloud spending. In October Brian Olsavsky, Amazon‚Äôs chief financial officer, admitted that AWS‚Äôs annual sales growth had declined to around 25%, the slowest on record. The average remaining lifetime of AWS contracts also ticked down in the most recent quarter, suggesting that customers are signing fewer deals or shorter ones. Microsoft, the second-biggest cloud provider, said on January 24th that it expects sales growth at its cloud unit to decelerate by four or five percentage points this quarter.> > Another problem is stiffening competition. As covid pushed shoppers online, traditional retailers switched their focus to e-commerce. Walmart increased its last-mile-delivery capacity four-fold just since the start of 2022. Target, another legacy supermarket chain, has used its acquisition in 2017 of Shipt, an online-shopping platform, to spruce up its digital-sales channels. Between 2018 and 2021 six big conventional retailers, including Walmart and Target, increased their collective share of American e-commerce spending from 8% to 12%, according to SVB MoffettNathanson. In the same period Shopify, a Canadian firm which offers merchants tools to sell online, expanded its market share in America from 5% to 10%. It is investing heavily in its own fulfilment service, which it launched in 2019.> > Rivals are making their presence felt in Amazon‚Äôs non-retail businesses, too. AWS‚Äôs healthy first-mover lead in the cloud is being eaten away. Numbers from Synergy Research Group, a data provider, show that its global market share in the business has more or less stabilised at just over 30% in the past three years. Its two main domestic rivals, Microsoft and Alphabet, have more or less drawn level with it when taken together. In advertising, Apple has a small but growing operation and Microsoft is dipping its toe in the water, signing a deal last year to provide adverts for Netflix‚Äôs new ad-supported streaming service.> > The combination of loss-making retail, slowing profit motors and growing competition is hammering Amazon‚Äôs profitability. The firm‚Äôs overall operating margin in the third quarter of 2022 was just 2%, the lowest since 2017. In the past four quarters Amazon lost $26bn in free cashflow (the money companies generate after deducting capital investments).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 09:51:50'] Kinda blessing in disguise and you cant base ur analysis on articles done by media.  Media is click bait playing on heart strings of suckers.  As companies try to cut costs they're gonna partner with aws google and microsoft for optimizing solutions.  Sure stock is down but these companies gonna only strengthen their customer relations for when tech spins back up.  Disruptions in Ad tech and lack of consumer spending beat down the google and and Amazon but they have other business to pivot and strengthen.  Amazon is getting into sports streaming etc.Ur better off reading press releases from these companies and forming ur own opinion.  Market is a game and heavy lifters make u see what they want so they can get you money.  These companies are powerhouses and tech cornerstones of our society. I'd cautiously buy some starters under 80 and watch for more dip as the long term rate impacts are starting to appear.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-30 04:04:29'] Investors should be worried that competitors (including Walmart) are catching up while Amazon is becoming a less appealing place to shop. Prime used to mean two-day delivery for most things. Now everything takes a week to 10 days. Search results are full of cheap knockoffs. Pricing is now no better and sometimes worse than competitors. Amazon is going to cost-optimize themselves out of the retail business. In 10 years Amazon might be a cloud storage and compute provider only.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 18:57:54'] Netflix I owned from 2009-2015 and dropped it when Amazon and a few others got into competition. Apple I owned from 2008-2011 when Steve Jobs died. I still don‚Äôt fully understand how they are so profitable when they haven‚Äôt invented anything since then‚Ä¶ Tim Cooke is just great at squeezing every penny out of consumers and app developers I guess.Amazon I have owned nonstop from 2009 to today, and have always been adding to my position.Facebook I never owned as I never really saw it as something that was irreplaceable. Social trends like what social media site is most popular rarely last more than a decade.Google I have never owned because they are a 1 truck pony (ads on search engine). They develop some very cool side products (igoogle, stadia, etc), but rarely throw all their marketing power behind it so they fail.I have no doubt big tech will continue outperforming the SP500 in years to come, but it‚Äôs always worth staying aware of the changes and making smart decisions based on the changing tides.

What type of products they makes or what service they present. and is there a demand on the products or the service's. is the business makes a profit and is there a demand on the products or the service's. then you go through the financial statements and do basic financial analysing to see is the company keep growing and makes profit or otherwise. This is how you do it if you really want to  make money and build your wealth and do it like i did. other then that is just a waste of money and time.
POST: ['2023-06-14 00:39:16'] POST TITLE: b'Better Cathie Wood stock: Roku vs. Shopify'
POST_TEXT: b" \n\n**Roku** and **Shopify** are two of Cathie Wood's favorite long-term holdings. The famed growth investor's flagship exchange-traded fund, the **Ark Innovation ETF**, holds Roku as its second-largest position (7.99% of its portfolio) and Shopify as its eighth-largest position (4.55%).\n\nBoth companies grew rapidly throughout the pandemic as consumers watched more streaming videos on Roku's devices and did more online shopping through Shopify-powered storefronts. But they both faced tough post-pandemic slowdowns as those tailwinds dissipated, and rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth stocks.\n\n That's why in 2022, Roku's stock plunged 82%, Shopify's stock fell 75%, and the Ark Innovation ETF shed 67% of its value. But since the beginning of 2023, shares of Roku and Shopify have both soared more than 70% as the Ark Innovation ETF rallied 36%. Does that rebound indicate it's finally safe to buy either stock again? \n\n#  Roku's post-pan"

And happens on multiple stocks. This is some sort of derivative or something. Nobody can figure it out because data is being skewed and withheld (cftc). Our markets in absolute shambles right now regulatory wise/abuse wise.Just like the NYSE 'glitch' the other day at open. They left the dang Disaster Recovery system on. That's not a mistake. It's never happened. And suddenly, t-2 from Jan 20th Swaps rollover we get some insane market 'glitch'. If you were smart, you'd have bought options and banked instantly in all that stuff that tanked.APs and MMs submit orders that are place on the opening bell the first second via a matching system which determines the opening price of stocks. Then of course they manipulate trades premarket on low volume to shake out weak investors.They are even using the glitch as an excuse to stop the SEC from switching from Payment for Order Flow to the new Auctioning system in March.TLDR: certain market participant manipulating and using it against the sec decision to change PFOF in March.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/nyse-glitch-caught-up-in-fight-over-sec-rewrite-of-trading-rules

DCA is a fair way to invest long term. but remember to take profits... today was the 2nd time I had to stop loss in the last 3 years because I wasn't paying enough attention and found out late they were liquidating or filing chapter 11, which leads to 2) don't get into more positions than you are ok to track, and keep up with the news otherwise you are holding for the sake of holding. if you're doing that just get the indexes... literally I do that on a monthly basis to avoid the extra research 3) look at the 5yr and 10yr...we are at levels now that we're seen back then in many places, so we are hitting a cycle, but the fed and govt are doing some shady stuff too so who knows what will happen.nutshell a) don't invest what you cannot afford to lose B) make sure you are ok with the choices to act, don't act, or do something else.

The ability to trade anywhere via mobile likely increases investors‚Äô propensity to trade in comparison to online- or phone-based trading. These mobile investing apps frequently market themselves through elite sport, a marketing strategy first developed by the gambling industry [61]. This marketing often emphasizes that the apps have either low or zero explicit fees [60], and the apps themselves can contain constant notifications and gamification elements nudging investors toward more frequent trading [62]. These apps can even profit from charging zero explicit fees via a financial arrangement called ‚Äúpayment for order flow‚Äù (Rooney & Fitzgerald, 2020) [63]. This extent to which financial trading apps do not clearly communicate the true cost of their use is similar to the ways gambling operators obfuscate mandated cost-of-play information on gambling products.‚Äùhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9105963/Please invest only what you can afford to lose (I think of my individual stocks as ‚Äòplay‚Äô money and only put in a few hundred at a time when I have spare money and know I want to gamble - I‚Äôm fully salaried).

Layoffs can be seen as a negative sign by investors, as they may view the downsizing as a sign that the company is not performing well financially. This can lead to a decrease in the stock price. The stock market is complex though and there are many factors that can influence stock prices. It's not always possible to accurately predict how the market will react to a specific event.

Amazon is the extreme kind where it deploys extra capital back to lowering the price to benefit customers, investing in infrastructure to improve efficiency, and deploying to growth markets to gain scale. It doesn't pay dividends, it doesn't buy back shares.  This is very clear from its income statement. It's loss-making in its DTC e-commerce business and yet makes handsome profits in its B2B cloud unit. The former is more sensitive to pricing and the latter is not so much.  It's really a unique case study about modern entrepreneurship and capital allocation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:44:43'] Bunch of assholes, also SBF will get away with it‚Ä¶ too much political power at this point
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:23:59'] Sure. 20 years to life.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:37:54'] The balls on this guy lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:42:31'] He's must see TV so it will boost attendance interest no doubt.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:47:46'] This on god looks like the most boring line up ever
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:00:19'] Yikes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:24:56'] Lolol what a terrible lineup
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:11:03'] Jail the bastard!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:04:20'] Birds of a feather.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:17:13'] How is this guy so teflon coated?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:27:18'] Third largest donor to the DNC not sure why everyone is surprised he‚Äôs not only walking free but doing public engagements.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:30:43'] This world is so dumb that he will probably get the most airtime.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:36:10'] What an awful lineup of people. What a lineup of awful people.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:37:10'] There are a lot of unlikeable people in that picture
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:55:41'] I heard he speaks after Bernie Madoff's hologram
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:10:43'] He made enough donations to democrats to be above the law for the rest of his life
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:21:23'] You have people far more evil than SBF speaking there so it‚Äôs not really a big deal
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:17:27'] This is not a winning group of people. Holy corruption
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:23:29'] Ukraine's president got time for these functions while fighting a war on his homeland?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:37:54'] The collapse of FTX is a orchestrated move, just like alllllll the other collapses lately. Everybody loses trust in digital currencie and then suddenly there will be a CBDC or shall we call it the WEF coin, that is the safest of them all, just like your real dollars bla bla bla and they will manipulate us through media that we have to use that one and all the other coins are shit. And Sam‚Ä¶ Sam will not be in prison for 1 day because he is all part of the plan.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:31:28'] I wouldn't be caught dead out of a non extradition country if i were him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:11:32'] The only time SBF should be given is Prison Time! Jmo
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:16:24'] Prison time yes. Air time no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:24:44'] These are the people they mean when they say eat the rich.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:25:20'] I think at least half that list should be in jail.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:42:12'] With Bibi and Eric Adams there he seems to be in good company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:48:01'] I‚Äôll be surprised if someone doesn‚Äôt run on stage and prison shank him.   If they are shooting up gay night clubs why not the summit next ?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:49:43'] The speaker line up would be enough to turn me off with or without Sam.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:50:03'] If they hand out rotten fruit and vegetables to the audience.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:51:19'] Ok, now let‚Äôs take a poll: who‚Äôs the biggest fuct head of the lot?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:53:52'] Even Madoff couldn‚Äôt escape. He screwed some wealthy people.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:20:20'] Mr Netanyahu please do not speak at this event
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:22:07'] Wtf this guy needs to be in jail‚Ä¶ is this true or a joke ?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:29:33'] What is NYT doing? Half of these are criminals. Lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:32:10'] What in the island of misfit speakers is this?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:32:26'] Sure, and while we're at it, they should invite Elizabeth Holmes to talk about ethical health care innovation.But seriously, if I were the other panelists I'd withdraw from the Dealbook Summit if they don't pull the fraudster's invitation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:35:08'] He should be in jail for life
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:35:18'] It kind of means everyone in that picture is just as corrupt, right?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:58:25'] I mean if you look at the rest of the names why not?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:13:56'] Centralized media
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:14:16'] Lmao
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:21:53'] What a wonderful group of crooks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:21:57'] Nightmare blunt rotation
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:25:37'] He should be arrested and prosecuted!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:26:20'] He's gonna be a no show. He wouldn't risk being arrested on America soil.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:33:26'] Imo, none of these people should get air time. Idc who they are. They all have skeletons in the closet, which have caused people extreme discomfort.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:49:22'] He should be arrested as soon as his plane touches down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 03:13:17'] Might as well livestream Bernie Madoff
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 16:18:40'] I don‚Äôt think he should make his location public for a while‚Ä¶ that much money gone and he‚Äôs bound to ‚Äúcommit suicide‚Äù any day now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-25 18:40:40'] Yes give him the rope.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 22:53:32'] Fuck FTX
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 15:56:31'] He‚Äôs trying to paint the public record.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:00:23'] Not even a little surprised that an activist enterprise like the NYT would do this. They are in bed with pretty much every progressive white collar criminal.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:07:13'] You know you F'd up when you're listed ahead of Shou Chew.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:31:18'] ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:03:54'] Bs, he‚Äôs not appearing at any public anything. That‚Äôs about as smart as a democrat riding in a open car through Dallas Texas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:03:34'] I‚Äôm done with NYT forever after this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:07:54'] Not one single respectable person listed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:49:24'] When you donate millions to the Democratic Party you get certain privileges others don‚Äôt , geeze get over it , it‚Äôs the way it is now
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:26:24'] he should be given prison time! Mass swindler continuing to be fluffed by socialist sycophants who can't admit being wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:00:17'] I hope he gets tomatoes and shoes chucked at him. And fuck the New York Times. They should stick to crosswords, their Journalism has become a biased pile of liberal dogshit‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:54:18'] Same line as Larry
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 09:54:31'] so is he taking the opportunity to publicly apologise?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:01:38'] How much to speak there?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:03:12'] There setting this up as some sort of sting when he lands on US soil to drown out something else or drive rhetoric around something else... Or he's just very delusional and has the politicians on the hook for the scam
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:09:13'] They will hopefully arrest him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:09:52'] I hope get doesn‚Äôt get egged-Cramer
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:14:32'] Andy Jassy is legit though. Really cool guy and very down to earth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:19:52'] Crazy blunt rotation
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:19:56'] Hope he gets arrested when he lands
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:20:26'] He should probably have bodyguards.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:24:22'] It‚Äôs a trap!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:33:49'] He was disinvited.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:34:05'] How is he able to be a part of this event? He should be in jail
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:35:39'] Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.  So, let him speak.  Let's hear what he has to say...
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:36:13'] Fuck this guy and his stupid, punchable face. I can‚Äôt even type how angry this guy makes me and I didn‚Äôt even lose money to FTX. Him and Mr. Wonderful can Mr. SuckMyFatBalls. If I ever catch this dude in a League match he will feel my wraith
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:37:21'] Lmfaooo
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:37:40'] Obviously not.. they‚Äôll be disinviting him ASAP
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:39:36'] How is he not being arrested for fraud? I honestly don‚Äôt understand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:41:31'] Let's see who sits in the seat next to him...
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:41:40'] Televised from which jail?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:43:39'] It's shame full, he stolen billions of the clients!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:45:39'] This is disgusting
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:50:47'] I mean he did donate alot to the same guys they support
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:50:50'] How is he not under arrest?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:53:03'] Where‚Äôs KG and GG? imagine Brandon is the special guest
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:54:29'] Should he be given any air time? No Any jail time? Yes, lots of it
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:54:39'] No!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:55:49'] How is this guy not in prison already??
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 10:56:33'] If the subject is grifting then why not?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:04:28'] He, Zuck, and that fucking yahoo should be barred.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:05:11'] SBF is a moron, he is facing years in prison and he can‚Äôt keep his mouth shut, which goes to show, he is so arrogant has no regard for consequences. That‚Äôs why he took investor funds and transferred them to Alameda. Anyone who names a company after the county which the city of Berkeley is located is way out there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:05:35'] I have a bigger problem with Janet Yellen
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:06:55'] This is obviously just a coordinated effort to get him to the USA so we can arrest him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:07:56'] Fuck no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:09:19'] Is it possible to follow this live?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:17:13'] Isn't there a federal warrant out for him?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:23:28'] we should only hear from him at the arraignment
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:26:22'] It would be a great opportunity to fit him with some new bracelets!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:27:10'] Yea he can explain how ballgag works
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:28:57'] No, just jail time
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:40:03'] This is real?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:44:36'] Of course. Last minute he won‚Äôt and say he had family matters to deal with in some exotic places
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:46:01'] Why is this guy not being arrested, is corruption just a joke now after 2008?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:46:05'] It‚Äôs fine and actually funny. He has to know they‚Äôre going to ask questions about this. I can‚Äôt believe his lawyers ok‚Äôed this though when there most likely is an investigation into him and what happened in the collapse. If he was smart he‚Äôd stay far away from journos but then again he also was so ‚Äúsmart‚Äù he got himself into this mess to begin with
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:47:14'] Sure get it all out before you‚Äôre indicted
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:48:22'] He will be arrested eventually. I think FTX being in the Bahamas kind of makes it more complicated, but he‚Äôs screwed over a bunch of other rich people so you know it‚Äôs coming. Calm down internet. You always expect instant results. Dude is not stepping on US soil anytime soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:53:22'] I do! I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes that everyone thinks he is nothing more than a piece of shit. After that, he can go crawl into a hole somewhere. Preferably with a cell mate named Boo-Bang
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:53:50'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 11:53:59'] Arrest him!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:01:38'] No because he should be in prison
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:12:17'] He needs to be in jail for his own safety‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:21:58'] I hope he gets arrested on the way in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:44:26'] LOL this guy should be in prison. He‚Äôs trying so hard to ‚Äúclear‚Äù his name. What a fool.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:45:56'] So good for Zelensky to have time off from the war to attend üòê
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:49:03'] I would love to see SBF get some air time. The clips of him are hilarious.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:52:47'] Embarrassing inclusion if you ask me‚Ä¶ as are a few others.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:53:13'] He fits in half the people on the panel are corrupt and inept.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:54:45'] Damn the amount of corruption in this photo is unreal lol most should be having a mug shot up on there
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:56:09'] bitchass should be jailed but different rules for them, eh?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:56:39'] What is this conference lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:56:42'] lol absolutely not. he should face mob justice
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:58:17'] Air time? Jail time
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:58:35'] How is he not in jail?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 12:59:27'] At what point is corruption so obvious we just ignore it?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:04:40'] Did the Tin Man have metal balls?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:06:31'] put him in right after Yellen. should be epic misguidance
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:07:56'] There‚Äôs no way he actually ends up speaking at the event
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:09:12'] Nope
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:11:52'] Hi ho ha ho ha ha hah ha ha ha bla ha ha haa hah ha
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:15:28'] Yes so he can have a chance to come clean and tell his cautionary tale, then get ready for jail.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:16:57'] Zoom call from jail?If Yellen is there, he deserves to say dumb shit too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:17:10'] :clown :world
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:18:31'] Well he‚Äôs joined by Netanyahu and Mike Pence so he may not be the most hated man in the group.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:20:15'] Maybe the FBI will present him with a shiny pair of handcuffs
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:21:00'] Fuck no. That guy should be in handcuffs right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:23:40'] Wait until we find out the remaining two surprise guest speakers are Bernie Madoff and Jeffrey Epstein from beyond the grave.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:38:44'] Not at all. Neither should Yellen
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:41:39'] Honestly at this point he has shown he is a fraud with little business sense. He has shown his incompetence in the way he ran his business and only accomplished stealing money and tightly controlling public opinion about himself. I see no point in giving him air time because although what he says may be entertaining it is detrimental to take any of his advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:42:48'] I think he should Be arrested.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:42:48'] How isn't he in jail????????????
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:43:56'] The difference between him & many of the rest is that he got caught.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:44:35'] Is this guy going to have any money left after this or will he be on the street?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:45:43'] Just looking at all the crooks in the room. #mafia.bank.cartel

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:47:44'] He should be arrested
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:48:56'] Pends
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:50:37'] The corruption wall of fame?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:51:46'] Yes.  Let‚Äôs hear what he has to say, and also what the other speakers say about Essbieff
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:51:52'] I'm shocked NYT invited Mike pence. Good on them for not having monolithic guests, I suppose.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:54:15'] I mean you got Mike Pence and Benjamin Netanyahu so he‚Äôs not the most psycho in the room
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 13:54:32'] seems to fit in with everyone else in terms of ethics
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:00:37'] Fits right in
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:01:27'] If Mike Pence the Chief Enabler will be attending I don‚Äôt see why not ‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:03:54'] This is exactly why our country is in shambles and the rich control everyone and eveything.  Fried was smart he just gave anyone who invested bitcoin money to Washington.  He is the 2nd biggest donor to the Democratic Party.  That says more than enough about our politicians.  Clinton's were besties with him and same with any other major political Democrat.  Fact he is still walking or even able to speak is mind blowing. This shows truly how little control the average person has in the US.  We live in  country that money is more important than morals or anything.  If everyone in the picture disappeared forever tomorrow.  World would be a much better place.   But I'm sure they taught their own children to be even worse.  This will never stop until normal people can get along.  They have torn the country in half so now no one can  do anything.   US politics is no longer politics.  People with money get voted in or pay to have their person in place to change laws to benefit them.  Sorry for the paragraph novel message just disgusted with our country and how we just let people steal on the highest levels and nothing ever happens.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:04:12'] They are all scam artists!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:04:53'] I feel like he‚Äôll be immediately arrested (should be anyways).  I really hope this is a trap
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:06:11'] Whoever pays money? Don't we give the most airtime to the corrupt ministers and harmful politicians daily? They enter our TV media newspaper too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:06:12'] Quite a line up.  All I have to say.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:08:02'] One of these people donated $40 million towards campaigns for this past midterm. Hope it all returned by the politicians
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:09:11'] Right there with Mike pence lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:09:47'] Sure he fits into this clown show.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:09:55'] He should go to jail
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:15:41'] There isn‚Äôt a fucking utterance this clown could share that I would have any interest in hearing.  At least it‚Äôll make it convenient for process servers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:16:20'] There isn‚Äôt a person in that list I‚Äôd care to listen too
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:17:48'] Ye yarned us.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:18:11'] Yeah it's a good opportunity to get a live interview and pressure test him
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:24:33'] Looks like NY Times is working hard to ruin their brand .
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:28:46'] Yea in failure find success
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:29:05'] BS, the guy should be under the prison
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 14:30:00'] Keep him alive

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 15:17:10'] Eric Adams (I‚Äôm a NYC resident), Van Jones, Netanyahu, Pence, and Zuckerberg could be the worst lineup of all time. I guessing SBF is still on the docket because they have intentionally booked controversial, divisive speakers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-24 18:51:24'] Seems pretty straight forward to me‚Ä¶ if the NYT grills him as hard as they would grill, say, Donald Trump if Trump did this, then I see no problem. But if instead they play cover and lob up softball questions to him, they are beyond redemption.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-31 19:58:42'] I don't know if this is too off-topic or anecdotal, but my hesitation with Amazon is more of a quality control problem in their core business.   They have increasingly become a pass through for third party sellers of Aliexpress-style products with all-caps brand names that were created in a blender.   (Looking for an OLUOQI watch band?  Look no further!)  And there are tons of reviews from people who claim the products they received are contraband.   Personally, I've been more inclined to buy from Target or other retailers lately.  I think people are going back to Costco in search of deals, too.   I'm holding, but not buying more.

Walmart has 0 investment in cloud tech while Amazon competes directly with Azure and Google. Ask yourself:1. Will Amazon continue to eat Walmart‚Äôs market share? Yes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-31 10:09:26'] I've made a few moves trading Amazon since 2019, but I'm holding very few shares after I sold the majority in Nov '21. It may very well get back to 3K by August, but I don't see any strong potential over the next few weeks. I'd suggest allocating no more than 10% of your portfolio. The split will be relative with no substantial gains, and will increase the potential for volatility. This is because new investors will be short and those holding are still largely in the red.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-01 08:51:45'] Amazon latest movement is due to everyone buying the stock with the interest of being short on the stock‚Ä¶.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 04:04:55'] I got this data from Amazon's 2021 10-K which provides much better details in each division. 30 years ago Amazon just sells books. 20 years ago it just sells items on its own. Since then, it has branched out to include 3rd party sellers, charging ads, and most importantly growing the cloud business which is the vast majority of profits, even though a small contribution to revenue. Its subscription business is now also a $30B division, and its physical stores are taking in $17B last year. It has definitely become a more diverse business.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 06:14:41'] I'm shocked the physical stores bring in money at all.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 19:40:47'] Least surprised.  The new CEO already putting a number of cost cutting programs. One I suspect after Xmas delivery is cut delivery service.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 13:12:25'] * Earnings: 28 cents per share* Revenue: $127.10 billion vs. $127.46 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates    Like the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has had a rocky year so far as it confronts macroeconomic headwinds, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Those challenges have coincided with a slowdown in Amazon‚Äôs core retail business, as consumers returned to shopping in stores.    Under CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in July 2021, Amazon has responded to rising expenses by aggressively cutting costs across numerous divisions in recent months. It shed warehouse space, halted some experimental projects, shuttered its telehealth service and froze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business.    Still, analysts are expecting Amazon to report solid third-quarter results, thanks to easier comparisons with last year‚Äôs numbers and a potential sales boost from its annual Prime Day discount event, which was held in July.    Revenue growth is projected to come in at 15%, marking a return to double-digit expansion after three straight quarters of growth in the single digits.    Another bright spot could be Amazon‚Äôs advertising unit, which has been more resilient compared to peers including Meta, Alphabet and Snap, whose ads businesses have gotten whacked due to the economic environment and Apple‚Äôs iOS privacy changes last year.    On Tuesday, Alphabet missed expectations for the third quarter, and YouTube‚Äôs ad revenue declined for the first time since Google started breaking out results for the streaming video unit. Facebook parent Meta stumbled again on Wednesday, issuing disappointing earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the fourth quarter.    ‚ÄúBesides allocation to TikTok, budget shift to lower funnel activities is the consistent point of feedback in our conversations with marketers this quarter,‚Äù said Rob Sanderson, a managing director at Loop Capital who recommends buying Amazon shares, in a recent note to clients. ‚ÄúAmazon is the lowest on the funnel.‚Äù    Wall Street will also be paying close attention to Amazon‚Äôs fourth-quarter guidance. The forecast could signal how much demand Amazon expects to see during the holiday shopping period. Analysts are already girding for a lackluster season, with online sales expected to grow just 2.5%, according to Adobe.    Earlier this month, Amazon hosted a 48-hour Prime Early Access Sale, which was the first time it has held two major discount events in the same year. The event jump-started the holiday shopping period early, and it could help juice Amazon‚Äôs sales in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv are projecting fourth-quarter revenue of $155.15 billion.    Analysts have taken different approaches to their per-share earnings estimates because of Amazon‚Äôs hefty investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian, which went public late last year. The plunge in Rivian‚Äôs share price forced Amazon to take a combined $11.5 billion markdown in the first two quarters of 2022. However, Rivian shares rebounded a bit in the third quarter, climbing 28%, which could lead Amazon to mark up the investment.    Amazon shares have slid 34% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index has dropped 20% over the same period.

Idk about you guys but I share my prime account with friends and family members. You just have to plan it right and share as many accounts as possible with those you trust. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Disney... I share all of it and pay probably $10 total per month for all of these services.If you're really on a budget, their music+videos+photo storage+twitch games, etc., is good value rather than if you were to just be subscribed to Netflix. Content is lacking, sure, but it's still good value if you truly use it.Amazon has pretty much put a vacuum on the market to where most won't be turned off by this price increase. Those who cancel will probably just re-subscribe once they realize the alternative isn't really worth saving $20.

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 22:03:35'] Amazon AWS is a huge software platform with great margins and very large costs accruing to clients from rewriting and software engineering if any clients leave for competitors.Its business model is essentially the same as IBM in the 1960's and 1970's (immensely powerful and profitable with strong lock-in) except for the location of hardware, which is more centralized due to networking technology.It's a similar business as Microsoft.Tesla will eventually have more competition in its vehicles that will reduce margins, most prominently from state-supported Chinese competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 20:46:15'] No way! I guess there must be more to this stock buying thing than just "net-income" and revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 13:12:10'] Amazon has more re-investment opportunities because it has a wide moat in 2 industries, retail and cloud services. Tesla is a 1st-mover in premium EVs. To answer your question- Retail is pretty low margin. When you spend 100 bucks on Amazon- they probably make 1 dollar. So that's why the revenues are different. Amazon gets paid by customers before they are billed by suppliers- so it has an Investment Float like insurance but not exactly. Tesla is the opposite basically.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 14:50:59'] I didn‚Äôt look into it, but likely because of gross margin, cost of revenue expansion and addressable market for cloud and data centres

Remember that all the inflation in the country (government spending) is being hidden in the stock markets and crypto markets.  Most of that money never got into the people's hands, which is why we are not seeing a ton of inflation other than in the housing market, stock market and crypto market.  Money has to have a home.  I think they are going to hoard cash, wait for the market to crash, and then buy back everything on the cheap.  Of course you know is gonna get fucked and be worse off in this process.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 03:11:29'] To everyone saying it looks ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù just because they hired a lot of people during the pandemic. We are talking about actual people losing their jobs. And in tech people often uproot their whole life to move to a faraway location, possibly even to another country. This is NOT reasonable. When you hire people you should be prepared to keep them as much as possible through the bad times and the ‚Äúbad times‚Äù have only lasted a few months so far! If we were in a recession for several years then yes I get they would have to eventually rethink how many employees they can have but this is just ridiculous playing around with peoples‚Äô lives like this over the span of a few months.

We might only have a mild recession, it might mainly be white collar software jobs that face layoffs, and those laid off might be able to find new work without massive struggle or hug paycuts‚Ä¶ However, there is a chance that as the economy and work force digests the mild drawback in tech spending over the next 18 months, just as we look to be getting through that we might more and more of those software jobs being replaced by AI bots to keep companies operating margins from falling apart as they loose pricing power during a consumer downturn. And that ‚Äúgreat replacement‚Äù would be the potentially catastrophic recession that feels and acts more like the ‚Äò00 or ‚Äò08 ones than the 1990 one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 02:44:28'] From what I understand they hired a lot of people as remote working took off and companies ramped up their use of MS Teams and the Office 365 platform. $MSFT are sacking a bunch of people from 343 Industries (Halo) from what I've read. $MSFT has very diverse IT products so I'm not sure why anyone reads this as panic.

Between the punishment doled out by investors over the last year or so and its soaring valuation during the pandemic, theres a lot of noise affecting Amazon shares. After considering those impacts, a bullish view still looks appropriate for the long term.\n\nTo deal with its $2.7 billion loss in 2022, Amazon began a raft of cost-cutting measures, including halting its experimental projects, cutting 18,000 jobs, and pausing grocery store growth. Those moves should benefit the company over the long run because 2022 served as a sort of wake-up call: even tech behemoths arent invincible.\n\nHowever, when we look more closely at Amazons valuation relative to its history, it becomes clear that it may take some time for the bull thesis to play out.

Kroger is a much cheaper e-commerce play if you want to buy a US company investing in delivery and growing their e-commerce capabilities, such as by opening warehouses for online delivery in Florida (where they don't have any retail stores).  International e-commerce options like MercadoLibre are growing faster than Amazon, giving a chance to get in at an earlier stage in their lifecycle.  I'd also look at niche retailers, like sporting goods, that are getting into e-commerce such as Dicks Sporting Goods or Academy Sports.  It is much easier for these niche players to grow revenue by double digits, while Amazon's size is starting to slow down its ability to grow or succeed in new ventures.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 04:32:42'] Honest question: do premarket trends and futures accurately predict the trend after the opening bell? Based solely on my observations, it seems like there is no real correlation between pre-market trends and the action during the trading day. But media outlets always talk about whether the indexes are up or down before open.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-14 05:56:40'] What I‚Äôve noticed and started doing lately, is any time there is something I want, I look for it directly on the company‚Äôs website first. Most of the time it‚Äôs the same price, there will be a discount code for 5-15% off if you do a little googling, and then usually a free shipping code if you do a quick google search and the shipping is usually pretty quick. This way I know what I‚Äôm buying is legit and not some counterfeit knockoff (which is a huge problem on Amazon) , and I can support the company directly without giving any money to bezos for just being a middleman Fuck Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-14 04:22:18'] Yeah Amazon copies products thats what Amazon Basics is, I saw recently they even sell silk pillowcase sets ffs. They obviously saw it was a product selling well and decided they needed their cut of the market share. They‚Äôll do that for all products which do well and can have a factory made/bought for on the cheap in China.Edit: I should add Amazon aren‚Äôt the only ones doing this but they seem to endorse it on their platform. Most sellers on Amazon now seek out hot products on the platform, then find a Chinese supplier and drop ship it at a premium. That‚Äôs how Amazon has become flooded with junk, and at this point it‚Äôs become a positive feedback loop too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-14 09:19:03'] I use to buy everything from Amazon. In fact I'd say about 70-80% of my online purchases are through Amazon. But a couple years ago I found out that this hair product I was using through Amazon was as straight up knock off. Since then I stopped buying any healthy/beauty products there. I also tell everybody to do the same. It's a shame tbh. Amazon is convenient and there are some great deals. But Amazon Basics, which forces third party sellers to go cheap, is making everything kind of shittier. I'm just happy Costco doesn't have third party sellers tbh.

They take their best sellers and roll out amazon choice product. Which is product they make themselves or they help push for money.It's really a no-brainer. Amazon has all your vendor data and they see you are selling a lot of product, why wouldnt they want to cut you out? One of the few cases where the middleman cuts out the other middleman.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-14 12:11:28'] Amazon provides a reliable service overall, but they really need to improve the search and review functions. Unless you are looking for a unique product like a specific book. most search results will be clogged with lots of generic knock-off products of unknown quality. If the reviews actually worked you could just filter to find the reliable products, but since everything now gets 4-5 stars this isn't a very good indicator.Best to completely disregard 5 star reviews and read the 4 and 3 star reviews for a more accurate evaluation. Although I think some brands have caught on to this and started pumping out 4-star reviews that sound pretty similar to 5-star reviews.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 05:08:48'] Here is the paper.   https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433It is worth a read.  Basically they found that switching using 100% optical uses a ton less power.  So instead of converting, switching, and converting back.   Google instead keep it optical and have mirrors that are physically moved to change connections.It does need to be longer life connections as it takes almost a second to realign each time to switch the connection paths.This is a pretty big deal.   Ultimately there is a cost to run large language models like Bard and ChatGPT, etc.     The cost is over 100x of using a traditional search engine that at the core uses Backrub/Page Rank.   This paper is really dated but so much more true today than ever before.  Google was really smart to start preparing for today 8 years ago with the development of the TPUs.  I think this is a place Microsoft has really made a mistake in not doing the same and dependent on Nvidia.https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/I do love that Google shares this stuff.  I am retired now and a lot of free time but get a real charge out of learning.  But I think from an investment standpoint Google really should not be so generous.   But I guess they find it is worth it because it helps them attract the best talent.    Top talent want to share things.  I think this is a big reason Apple does so poorly when it comes to AI.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 06:23:50'] I wouldn‚Äôt take specific advice from anybody on here.  Really from anybody anywhere.  Nobody knows when the market will enter a bull phase or how stock a vs stock b will do.  This is why experts tell us amateurs to invest in index funds.  We don‚Äôt have the data or time to do individual stock investing.  It‚Äôs a game where you are trying to outsmart other people who are smarter and have more time and experience than you.  So you are gambling to get lucky.   Diversify and play the long game.  It‚Äôs the only thing that works for individual investors over the long term (unless you have insider info).  Don‚Äôt try and time the market, but instead invest more during down periods to cost average down.  The market always trends up over long time horizon.  Lastly, everybody thinks they are a genius when they are doing well, which is very common during bull markets (last 12-13years).  So most of the advice you‚Äôll get is from ‚Äúkids‚Äù who haven‚Äôt been through multiple cycles.  Those older people like myself have and know better.  Good luck and don‚Äôt be stupid/greedy/impatient/emotional or else you will lose.

I myself currently only hold 2 stocks right now, both have market caps in hundreds of billions, loads of cash on their bank accounts and I still keep half of my money I plan to invest to average down my positions in these two companies depending on the progress of the recession in 2023, when the companies could get even cheaper.buying stocks is not for everyone, it takes years to learn how to tolerate risks, so you may want to start with safe ETFs following the main indexes for a while.

Even the best gets tricked ones or twice, the differense is admitting to yourself you've been duped and move on.Also looks like (haven't made a deep dive) that beyond meat only loves one thing and that is torching cash, if they burn the cash they have on hand now there's little to no chance they'll get refinanced in a market like this.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 17:19:28'] I'll pick one to comment on and abstain from the vote on the rest - I think BABA can come back up - by a fair amount even if it takes many years to retake the ATH.  The COVID restrictions have reduced economic activity in China.  When they finally admit they are being dumb and let people live a mobile life with full COVID risk, a big weight will be lifted.  BABA should ride that in a good way.  It is a VIE that is really only a tracking investment vehicle and not actually a stock, but it is what is available so I think it is not bad to hold on to.

This looks like $15,000? And you‚Äôre down 34%. I would sell your biggest losers, especially PLTR. PLTR is a stupid meme stock. It‚Äôs been around for 20+ years and has yet to turn a profit. The subreddit the tracks it is a GME like subreddit echo chamber that manipulates data and information to make it seem like very soon it‚Äôs going to blow up. These meme stocks and there subreddits are dangerous because they grossly exaggerate all types of news to make it seem really good and have managed to trick a lot of people. The people become bag holders and also become a cog in the system furthering the manipulation of data.

I‚Äôve found this to be the most common issue these days because of these ‚Äúinvesting, stock market‚Äù subreddits and the type of advice people give each other regarding stock picks. Trading is NOT the same thing as investing. I do both, they have different rules and timeframes.Given your poor performance on the year, don‚Äôt feel bad it‚Äôs a brutal bear market that has crushed most stock pickers, I would encourage you to reevaluate your selection criteria, consider diversifying more broadly, and ultimately consider indexing (bogglehead) for investing.

Read earnings and forward guidance then go read everything you can about valuing a company and what would be considered overvalued. Take some time to read about the very basics of TA like moving averages, RSI and levels of support. Don't watch anything on YouTube. Nothing on TikTok or any other bullshit where it's anything other than just straight up information from the company or investapedia where you can learn what things mean. Once you have an understanding then start looking at stocks you might want to get into and practice all of the things you've learned. Don't just decide you like a stock and buy it for that reason or because you use the service. Actually look at where you think you can make good entry points and have a plan for how long you will be invested and why you will be invested for that long. Don't just buy a stock that is a well known company and assume it will do well because it's done well in the past.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 02:36:09'] Easy, Tesla. Its already up 65% this year. People and institutions are starting to realise that they are not joking when they announced 50% YOY growth several years ago. The model Y is currently the world's 4th best selling car (not electric cars, ALL cars), and is on track to be the best selling car by the end of 2023. Almost all other car companies are losing sales.Then factor in that Tesla is starting to ramp up grid-scale battery storage. Their Lathrop factory is just coming into scale. Each multi-million dollar megapack is making 50% margins.If and when full self driving becomes a reality, that's an extra $15,000 pure profit on each car that buys it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 09:34:41'] Tesla bounced from being down literally 70%! and now it's in the running for top performer. Perfect example of where context means everything.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 13:59:52'] Compare the CVNA chart with DRYS from 2005 to 2008 and see DRYS current price in 2022.That's not to say CVNA can't come back because it can (but probably won't). I remember no one wanting to buy AAPL when it was selling for pre-adjusted 50 cents after Steve Jobs was fired, the company tanked and Bill Gates rescued AAPL from bankruptcy.But when and if CVNA ever comes back, you will have plenty of time to get in on the rise back up.  There is no play in buying this now and waiting.  Consider it a "value trap" if you want, or look inside yourself and search your feelings and see if they aren't related to the fear of missing out or fear or regret of having missed out, both of which are FOMO.There are way better opportunities and they are not that hard to find.Keep asking questions though and weigh the advice.  In the end though, you need to make your own mistakes and find your own way.One of the best trading videos ever (hopefully allowed as link by mods) mentions DRYS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XafQHxHKak

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 14:36:04'] The concept of buying a car online is fantastic. Carvana failed to execute on that ‚Äúblissful‚Äù car buying experience. Just ask the thousands of folks who never got their plates and registration after buying a car from them. Carvana is going the way of diapers.com. It‚Äôs a shame because I think they had a solid idea.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 21:04:07'] I‚Äôm actually looking to enter a long position in Carvana if it falls a little more. Yes I know it‚Äôs risky but I would start with a 0.5% position of my portfolio. Here‚Äôs my notes for Carvana I made the other day about this trade idea..- CVNA is down nearly 98% from its highs and roughly 40% the past few days. This is indicative of a fund liquidating their position.- It‚Äôs possible that we will see other funds step in and be forced to liquidate their positions as well which would drive price lower.- Carvanas sales model I will likely be the way of the future for car sales.- If CVNA continues to fall the company will not survive and will either go bankrupt or will be bought.- When you factor in the massive decline in price plus the futuristic sales model CVNA will likely look attractive to a major car company such as Ford, Porsche or Volkswagen to acquire.- This type of scenario makes for an interesting potential long trade.- This is just a theory, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it were to happen in the near future all things considered. If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôm wrong a little, if I‚Äôm right I‚Äôm right in a big way. To me, that risk v reward makes sense.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 14:14:00'] Just an Illinois perspective:  During COVID the Illinois Secretary of State essentially shut down for 18 months.  Among other things that weren't happening, auto titles were not being issued in anything close to a timely manner.  Carvana kept selling cars though, and then didn't give people the title to their new car for months.  Carvana also couldn't get temporary plates from the SOS in Illinois, so they gave people temp plates from other states.  Illinois responded by suspending their license to do business in the state.  I'm not sure they had a good business model anyway, but the State of Illinois locked them out for things that were really the state's problem.https://news.wttw.com/2022/08/01/carvana-back-hot-water-state-illinois-license-suspension-reinstated

Especially logistic delays can't be delayed forever as covid impact will slowly dissipates.  So... Sucks that the share price dropped so much but to a certain degree, the drop in share price  is warranted.  If anyone is interested, simply google auto loan debt, you'll see it's ridiculously high. Then factor in the increased in interest rate, and you'll see the impact of that towards future automobile sales. It's not sustainable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 17:26:29'] I would never invest in Carvana personally, but that's due to my own experience with the company.I put in an order to buy a car from them, a 2014 GMC Terrain, for a bit more than the vehicle was worth but it was about 35K under 100K miles so it was pretty low on miles and would likely last a while. I was in California at the time and the vehicle was in Arizona (a 6 hour drive from them to me) - I was all set to get the vehicle the next day and they failed to deliver. After the delivery time past they marked it as "delayed delivery" with no explanation and the soonest delivery date was a week out. Okay, I can wait a week.  Come the day before delivery date and there's another delivery delay, and again without any context so I chat with them to figure out what is up and they tell me there's a mechanical problem that needs addressed I pressed and pressed to get what exactly was wrong but the support people don't have direct access to the people at the distribution center and can only email them so there was never any information given. At any rate, another week until the next delivery for what is likely a pretty simple repair - so at this point I'm getting pissed, but again I'm in not in a hurry. The day before my next delivery date, delayed again - more "mechanical issues" with no information and this time a 4 day delay in shipping.  At this point I'm growing impatient with them and I get them to call me and I scream at them for fucking around but really nothing I could do.  The day of the next shipping, delayed again with a month long delay because "the bumper needs replaced", which screams of "the driver ripped the bumper off the car because he/she is incompetent" - any other excuse is invalid as if they sent it in for "mechanical problems" and the bumper needed replaced, why not do it then?At this point I was beyond done with Carvana, cancelled the order checked out CarMax and in 10 minutes found my car (2016 GMC Terrain with 60K miles) and 2 hours later I was at CarMax picking up my car.  Fuck Carvana.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:45:21'] The idea sounds good, but the execution was pathetic. When I was recently looking for a car, Carvana's prices were always way above the blue book value, and there typically were not big benefits to warrant the extra cost. So instead of paying 3,000 to Carvana, I paid 150 for a professional inspection (after I looked it over), and 39.00 for a carfax report.Not a company that I would invest in. Let it fall.

Got a quote from Carvana for $3,000 more than I bought it for 15 months before.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 20:31:09'] The thing about stocks in a bear market is that it can always go down 90% from where you bought it. Used car prices are falling rapidly.

Rightfully to be bearish on it but surprises are more likely to come on the upside.The company is now trading at 8/10x FCF. Yes, I get the concerns over the Metaverse spending and TikTok breaking their monopoly apart, but unless it's going to die in the next few years, the valuation seems really on the low side.I would love for Zuckerberg to come out tonight with a halt to the metaverse cash bleed and a huge buyback plan to retire 10% of shares within the next year.

If they divest ESPN and stop this stupid Disney+ attempt, and sell their product like before to other streaming companies, then I‚Äôd value them higher. Disney+ is the embodiment of too much money in the system. The only thing Disney has done right, was conning UFC into signing with ESPN.

Selling software alone will face challenges when marketplaces like Amazon or Walmart make it more convenient for people to browse multiple sellers at once.  In turn, Shopify only works for shops that have strong social media or search engine advertising to attract buyers.

Source: managed an Amazon warehouse for about six months this year before I quit in September. COVID was making shit crazy, I couldn‚Äôt imagine what working through the holiday season would be like.Basically, as a manager, you work 50 hours a week in a SALARIED position (up to 75 hours during peak, no less than 60) moving boxes, scanning shit, micro managing people, it‚Äôs a shit show.Bottom line is, every full time worker at Amazon is overworked, especially in this time. $300 does not make up for the 10-25+ UNPAID hours a lot of these guys work per week.For part time workers, $150 is equal to a whole work day. They never do overtime unless they choose to (and they are paid properly for it) Worth it on that front. The last straw causing me to quit was when they moved my shift from M-F 7a-5p to W-M 3a-1pm.

These 'small business owners,' although I do agree that a lot of them are scumbag resellers or scammers but I'm sure there are some honest folks there.&#x200B;edit: seems like a lot of people have had bad experience with amazon.  I order basically everything that isn't groceries off of amazon and haven't really had any bad experiences.  but i also read reviews of the products, the sellers, etc.  I also will pay more to get it from amazon directly or a higher rated seller.  what kind of things are you guys buying to have "7 out of the last 10 things I have ordered" came used?  and are you not taking advantage of amazon's very liberal return policy?  Hell, amazon just gave me a free kindle because I told a chat rep mine had a crack in it.  Didn't even have to send a picture or anything.  They've also sent me wrong items (a christmas ornament of one superhero versus another) and they just told me to keep the wrong one and they sent me the correct one immediately.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-14 01:17:42'] I don't think people know how Amazon works. They provide space on their website to independent sellers. They can check if these sellers are selling genuine, legal products but it's very difficult to see if the products are safe or not. It's like making the TV channel responsible for the safety of the products shown in their commercials or newspapers  liable for anything that is sold in their classifieds and ads. Of course Amazon does more than just that, it also takes care of logistics, but still it would be far fetched to make them liable for the product itself. That's not how eCommerce works. The law suit isn't about products that didn't arrive or were different from the description, it's about faulty products.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-14 08:07:55'] I remember ordering an item last year. It ended up being a 3rd party seller but I had assumed that Amazon would guarantee a fulfilled order or a refund. Needless to say the item never came and the seller disappeared. I never received confirmation of my issue or a refund from Amazon's customer service. After that I vowed to never buy from a 3rd party off of Amazon again. If it's fulfilled by Amazon themselves they will get make good on their end but 3rd party sales seem to really be a crapshoot which is pretty sad in my opinion.The worst part about this is the quality 3rd party sellers featured on Amazon get brought under the umbrella of being untrustworthy.

POST_TEXT: b" \n\nAmazon Prime rates are going up for US Customers on Feb 18th. **What that means for Amazon's revenue generated from Prime memberships?**\n\nAmazon had \\~151.9M US Customers in 2021. And its projected to have \\~157.4M by end of 2022. The annual price increase: $119 > $139, will generate an additional $3.8B in revenue\n\n(151.9M @ $119 = $18.07B | 157.4M @ $139 = $21.87B)\n\nBut, only half (48%) of subscribers pay annually. 52% of Prime Subscribers in US who pay monthly (with relatively high loyalty - 97%), their rates are increasing from $12.99 to $14.99, resulting in the following numbers:\n\n(78.98M @ $12.99 = $12.31B | 81.85M @ $14.99 = $14.72B)\n\nAn increase of $2.41B in revenue from monthly members.\n\nAdjusting the annual numbers a bit. For the annual subscribers (48% of total US customer), the updated numbers look like this:\n\n(72.91M @ $119 = $8.67B | 75.55M @ $139 = $10.50B)\n\nWhich would result in an adjusted increase of $1.825B from annual subscribers.\n\nThus, Amazon will generate an ad"

That‚Äôs both subscribers and non subscribers. Many are not using or realizing the existence of Prime Video, Music, or Prime Reading. Amazon needs to improve their Prime Video player and content. Definitely made improvements past ten years, but content needs more. People need to realize there‚Äôs more to Prime Membership. Also no one mentions additional savings at Wholefoods.

Between Hulu + $NFLX + $DIS + $SIRI +Ad infinitum, the peeps are easily floating a $200-$300 handle in subs.4.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 17:34:40'] If they use the added revenue to sure up worker loyalty and tighten the supply chain back up, it will be a good deal, otherwise they may max out and eventually start losing Prime members.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-17 12:01:37'] Amazon is going to slaughter store front pharmacy‚Äôs. Especially once their drone delivery service is fully operational.  How are companies like CVS, Walgreens, or even Walmart going to compete. When you‚Äôre at your doctors office, they will send the prescription to Amazon and on your way home a drone will deliver it to your door step before you even get there. Or maybe you‚Äôre sick in bed and you need Tylenol/cough drops and don‚Äôt want to drive, so you just order them on the Amazon app and they‚Äôre at your door in 30 minutes. Essentially the same time it would take to drive, but far easier and most likely cheaper. They need to be broken up, or every store front is going to go under. I really don‚Äôt feel like: living in a prime house, as a prime citizen, taking my prime medications, while watching prime videos, listening to prime music, eating my prime foods, while the prime drones overhead, and the Alexa microphones and video cameras watch my every move.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-17 22:33:44'] This is not good news. It just shows you the extent of the problem of unregulated growth of conglomerates like Amazon. Too much concentrated power within the business world is not good for the economy as a whole. I am not here to say stuff like eat the rich, but I think it's something to be cautions with a company of this size:1. I doubt that Amazon would fail any time soon, but if they decide to collapse for whatever reason (e.g. failed ventures, class-action lawsuits, government intervention, etc.), we'd be in a recession for years to come when the market struggles to fill what Amazon has been building over the years2. If Amazon doesn't fail and the government doesn't break it up, **theoretically speaking**, they will eventually take over every other sector of the economy and everyone suffers because there isn't any competition. There would be no economic growth, no innovation, no new IPOs and ventures that investors can take advantage of, etc. since there's no money left to be made. Of course, that's a hypothetical situation if Amazon takes over *everything,* but I doubt that would happen any time soon since he's not the only billionaire in the United States.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 03:04:22'] In the industry: it was a smart move after CVS bought the last huge insurance company. There wasn‚Äôt any insurers left for Amazon to buy so whats the entry into the market? Cash paying customers. They took the Walmart model and went next level: all rebates (both generic rebates and brand rebates) they receive they‚Äôre giving right to the customer (they‚Äôll make money on the warehouse markup and prime growth). No middleman of 3rd party warehouse, huge undercutting of pharmacy pricing, ever improving delivery performance, etc. It‚Äôll grab that market very quickly which is significant. The thing I‚Äôm not understanding is the partnership with all these pharmacies..haven‚Äôt figured out why they would work with amazon. Short term benefit to long term very bad impact in my opinion.  Maybe Amazon is talking to them about being a warehouse provider to them eventually (ie if there is one loser here it is McKesson). Pharmacies companies shedding capital etc invested in warehouse sector, similar to how all cell companies in areas rent from companies that solely put up towers.The next phase is the one that will be very interesting and where the meat is: insurance companies and their massive customer base. Amazon will have to offer an insurance model of some kind, either an enhanced prime membership etc. With the integration in other pharmacy groups with both insurers and carriers, Amazon will not be getting those customers..., but their insurance prime might begin attracting companies to move their health plans over. In my opinion there won‚Äôt be many players left: amazon, walmart, and cvs/caremark. Walgreens may end up getting aligned with one of those. There will still be need for physical location but much reduced.There will be a lot of pharmacists unemployed over next 5-15 years.

Amazon's listings often have hundreds or thousands of reviews, instead of the handful found on competing marketplaces. But many of those reviews can't be trusted. Thousands of fake reviews have flooded Amazon, Walmart, eBay and others, as sales have skyrocketed.\n\nThe repercussions are getting more serious, too, as shoppers stay home and increasingly turn online for things they'd normally want to shop for in person. In recent months, fake reviews have boosted sales of unsafe products and hurt business for legitimate sellers, causing huge brands to sever ties with Amazon."

As people left the site it's gradually gone back to what made it 'good'. Amazon is now in the stage of people 'breaking' the algorithm and the site is just a wreck.When i'm on Amazon now i refuse to purchase anything outside of the storefront of the manufacturer itself. Which isn't what the site was all about. It's about getting deals on items sold by 3rd parties or from Amazon itself... which is less and less the case as i'm essentially just buying from the manufacturer but using amazons logistics to get it to my door quicker and for free.Amazon needs to figure it.

If its cheap and looks like a nock-off, if its not part of Amazon prime, then its Chinese garbage full of fake reviews. They also have weird brand names or no brand whatsoever.  These items are also cheaper than they should be. You‚Äôve got to be stupid if you‚Äôre buying chinese junk and think its not from China. If you know its Chinese, then you know you‚Äôre taking a gamble on quality.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 06:31:10'] Amazon is still light years ahead of anything else when it comes to customer experience even with fake reviews.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 12:06:42'] And when there are 8k reviews to sift through it doesn‚Äôt matter if you can spot them because you can‚Äôt take the time to read them all. Even the fake spot websites aren‚Äôt that reliable anymore.This is why Consumer Reports was the end all, be all. Now people trust star ratings even when they know all top products are adjusted.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 13:01:55'] I've only ever bought I think two items from Amazon before? When I want something I generally want it now and Don't want to wait for shipping.But I haven't done any big purchases in awhile...maybe when I do I'll check out AmazonI'm still a shareholder though
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 14:12:15'] The one upside to amazon is that sellers are forced to accept returns. It is frustrating to receive a package that isn‚Äôt up to the standards you anticipated, for sure! Nonetheless, I‚Äôm happy that Amazon is willing to enforce their return-policy. Anything I‚Äôve ever returned has been hassle-free and without many questions asked. You can literally return something just because you don‚Äôt like it, where walmart is always questioning me on the items functionality!
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 19:14:12'] This isn't just amazon. It's any website with reviews even things like looking glass (for people talking about the company they work at). There was an old reddit thread that people who were in these sort of jobs would talk about the boosting reviews.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 20:41:05'] I know it can‚Äôt be this simple, but why not only allow 1 review per verified purchase?  The ability to use reviews is more valuable than same day shipping
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 20:43:43'] I used to be really happy with Amazon... Then I had an order from a 3rd party. I had to negotiate my return, they cancelled my return after it was in process (e.g. already mailed back per their instructions) and then had to involve Amazon.  It's not quite eBay yet but this is definitely the beginning of it... They need to make a big pivot.. Target, Walgreens etc will gladly take their customers.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 05:01:34'] I dont like Amazon and try not to use them ever.  The one and only good thing about Amazon is that they for the most part, have excellent customer service.  I've had several problems with some products I've bought from them and had no problem switching them out for a replacement.  Also one product was taking a very long time to get shipped out, and I had prime, and they ended up taking $10 off the product, which the cost wasn't even $20.    And just recently I had to swap out a defected product and Amazon shipped me the replacement and then I used the box that it came in to send back the defected unit.  Was very convenient.&#x200B;But other than that, I try to avoid Amazon because of the fakes.  That is one aspect I think Walmart is head and shoulders above Amazon.  Problem is Amazon lets too many 3rd party sellers and they are fakers.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 07:45:13'] The last item I intentionally ordered from Amazon was the complete boxed set of James Bond collection on VHS in 1999, right as DVDs were coming out.[Vol. 2](https://www.amazon.com/James-Bond-Collection-Two-Moonraker/dp/B00004RG68)\-Chances are if Im buying online then I know the product and I dont need a review to be convinced of it. Ive honestly never really paid attention to ANY reviews.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-07 08:53:37'] It‚Äôs pretty bad. I usually resort to going to the website for the specific brand and going through those reviews before buying something.

I feel like if I know a product has flaws, and what they are, I can judge it‚Äôs quality for what I‚Äôm purchasing for. At that, 5 stars are just ‚Äúomg i love this!‚Äù And 1 star are ‚ÄúI bought it, it came late and broken‚Äù. Neither of those reviews help me understand the product.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 21:09:07'] Here is what I don't understand; why does a business meeting with Amazon mean it is worth more than it is now? The stock price is dumping. The offer could easily be below the current price, but higher than where it will be if they don't do anything.Their current ratio looks OK before you notice that most of their current assets is in inventory that they can't sell. Once you realize that and consider their current ratio without the inventory, they're under water and about to drown.Their market cap is almost $8b and their total shareholder equity minus inventory is $300m. Perhaps they were talking because Amazon offered them a generous $4.3b.Unless somebody leaks the offer, there is no reason to even be sure that they were talking about a buyout, and not discounted inventory.Prediction: Tuesday/Wednesday will be a blood bath

We had 3 months of WFH while the plant stayed open as an essential business. We were immediately brought back full time once NYS issued lockdowns eased. The reasoning was that executive/office staff not showing up was a massive deterrent to factory workers who work in the same facility. Essentially, it set a low bar if executive management wasn't around. Every other friend, family member, family friend that works in a similar environment said the same exact thing.

POST_TEXT: b'https://fortune.com/2020/08/23/amazon-coronavirus-taxes-local-governments/\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought new scrutiny to the way in which Amazon treats its warehouse workers, whose exhausting, precarious positions now come with a decent chance theyll be exposed to a deadly virus. And yet, Amazon is going gangbusters to expand its network, opening new facilities all across the country with the aid of compliant cities and states and little recognition of Amazons devastating impact on local economies.\n\nIn North Andover, Mass., for instance, Amazon recently received $27 million in public funding to build a new warehouse. In Windsor, Conn., it was $8.8 million. The property taxes for a new Amazon distribution center in Glenwillow, Ohio, will be reduced by nearly half for 15 years. And the e-commerce giant is receiving taxpayer dollars for distribution facilities in Whiteland, Ind., and Arlington Heights, Ill., too. Overall, Amazon has received nearly $3 billion in subsidies from s'
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 06:48:54'] Because politicians want to claim they created all these jobs at reelection time. They leave out all the corporate welfare taxpayers provided and jobs lost on Main Street. They'll talk about the local income tax revenue workers will pay but leave out the property tax lost, which in Ohio provides a large chunk of our school funds. Schools then hit up taxpayers to pass another levy to make up the difference. Cities will fall all over themselves to give the most away and you don't want to be the city that didn't give enough away and lost all those jobs. Personally, I'd be interested in reading an independent study that compares the benefits vs costs and if these corporations create all the jobs they promised to get this welfare.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 09:25:52'] Amazon is not destroying Main Street, people‚Äôs changing shopping habits are. Why should I go to the store to buy something when I can have it shipped to me in two days or less. It‚Äôs smart for local governments to embrace this future with incentives rather then not just to protect dying business models. Main Street will find a way. Maybe instead of shopping, local places can focus on selling experiences, things for families to do together other then shop for more shit they don‚Äôt need.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 07:27:05'] It's creative destruction. Right now we're entering a paradigm shift like when they invented the automobile, suddenly you didn't need a horse. Or tractors for farms. Suddenly you didn't need 100 men to plough the fields. Amazon is ushering in the next best way to do things, so it's killing the whole need to go to the store.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 08:57:20'] 15 years ago, this exact same debate was being had about Walmart
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 08:17:20'] The idea is that the increased revenue from a larger economy will more than offset the reduced property taxes. If you give a business 10MM in property tax abatement and they bring in 1,000 jobs that generate 8MM in sales tax and raise housing prices to provide 4MM in extra property tax then it's worth it. The thing about cities is that success often perpetuates itself, which means a small to moderate tax abatement for a core business could generate lots of additional revenue for the town as it becomes a more attractive place to live and do business.Edit: I also didn't mention that less property tax is better than no property tax. If you have vacant land it is not generating any tax revenue, adding a new business there (even at a much reduced rate) can be a net positive for property tax revenues.

Then over 5.4 mill per year after that. That's a hell of a good income stream.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 13:41:54'] I am actually from Andover Ma and I can tell you North Andover before and after Amazon is not what many would have you believe. Let me preface this with the fact that I oppose monopolies and I am about as hardcore liberal as one can get but Amazon warehouses specifically are not the real issue. Due to politics and our wonderful capitalist's society competition is natural and needed for progress. The amount of technology that Amazon alone has created since January is unfathomable and almost all of this technology will positively impact some aspect of life. We need to transform our thinking to understand that not all big business is bad, just that politicians need to promote the little guy to force competition for the bigger guys. The problem with capitalism being controlled by politics is that politics is as much a competition as owning a business. Each city in the U.S. has to compete with it's own neighbors for federal funding, residency, and much more to provide the best services for its citizens and businesses. Unfortunately to be competitive nowadays you have to cut corners or go against ethics. This happens in the chicken industry where the quality of the chicken must be lowered to increase the usable meat when slaughtering them and lower the price of raising them. Politicians know that Amazon may affect local small businesses (many have not been able to compete for years so its not completely Amazons fault usually) but they want to provide better services and lower taxes to attract more residents(or just pay themselves more).  Its unfortunate but Amazon does make sense for almost all of us vs brick and mortar shopping. Its priced competitively for our benefit (for now) and consolidates a lot of manufacturing and retail allowing for more specialty businesses or more technology-based work and less minimum wage/unskilled labor. Many of our qualified high-skilled workers don't have enough job opportunities but every day my indeed is flooded with minimum-wage jobs.  We are a country filled with smart or at least brave people willing to do more than just the generic cashiering job for 11/hr. I think we need companies like amazon and google and fb to make way for more tech based work and work that our citizens deserve. &#x200B;Andover has actually increased its employment AND its annual income per person. So we have more jobs and they are paying better on average. Clearly that still means some people could have been hurt and many businesses are now gone. But more businesses (and probably more successful) businesses will reopen in their spot with new ideas and innovations and services to better provide for the community. We just need to find a way to make CEOs and politicians want to give back to the community to help provide for the people that are helping them make all their money as well.

Corporations always get state and local subsidies, tax breaks, and even free land from state and local governments. It‚Äôs just more apparent with Amazon because they‚Äôre building more and more hubs and logistics networks.

Why help amazon at all? Are they suddenly going to say gee guess we wont do business at all in your state? No - but you have states competing against each other in the dumbest fucking ways. The real solution imo is to have a ban on these type of incentives for all businesses in any state.
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 18:31:36'] Also the property tax financing is not robbing money from schools per say. If it was an empty plot of land, there would be minimal property taxes.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-23 08:55:09'] It's race to the bottom tax policy. In order to induce a big company to come to town with the promise of jobs, local and/or state governments will give tax breaks. If they don't, the company will go to one that does.In addition to screwing over local residents in terms of taxes, the long term plans never pan out like they're supposed to. When the tax holiday ends, either it's renewed or the company leaves, jobs included.Ideally, the federal government needs to have a tax policy that imposes some type of tax or reduces state funding based on this behavior as it relates to a state's dependence on federal dollars. The only ones who benefit are the companies and large shareholders.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 14:21:40'] I have been on a recession budget since last March.  I also knew I would need a new car (to me) and had a reasonable budget, had money set aside for the car since I wanted to remain debt free.  That said, I cut my discretionary spending down so I could save another $10k which I have done.  I plan to stay on the current budget through next year, then reassess.  Part of the budget cut was I chose not to travel this year.  I also deferred any home maintenance another year as the issues that need fixing are minor, not major.  I could live here another year like this if no more blinds break.  Anything functional gets fixed right away.  Cosmetic fixes are waiting for discounts.

POST_TEXT: b'January Jobs Report "jumped off the page" with an impressive 517,000 new jobs created! Despite the layoffs from tech giants like Dell, PayPal, Salesforce, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, a new study by Goldman Sachs suggests these companies are not representative of the broader economy. The common characteristics of these companies include being in the tech sector, hiring aggressively during the pandemic, and seeing sharper declines in stock prices. Economic bears continue to voice concern about the layoffs as a sign of a slowing economy, but Chief Economist Jan Hatzius believes it\'s an overreach. Job gains for November and December 2022 were also revised higher, and the job finding rate among unemployed individuals has been high by historical standards.\n Q: Are these layoffs a sign of a weakening US economy or just a result of tech companies restructuring?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 14:30:24'] Directly related to rising interest rates/cost of capital/valuations. Tangential related to upcoming recession.If you notice, most of these companies are heavily buying back stock while trimming employees. Meta just announced $40billion while laying off ten‚Äôs of thousands of employees, which could‚Äôve covered those employees salaries for over a decade.Tech sector is heavily influenced by interest rates both when it comes to borrowing and valuations. With zero percent interest rates, you could theoritically valuate tech companies at anything (see Tesla). Now that interest rates are normalizing for the first time since the GFC these companies have to adapt their operating costs/business models to show that they are viable in the new economy while appeasing the capital markets. A lot of these companies like Meta, Netflix or Tesla aren‚Äôt as fundamentally strong as they seem if interest rates were normalized. All three currently have intense competition chipping away at their market share and they‚Äôre only dominant because of first mover advantage and access to capital markets.So the change in interest rates is causing these companies to restructure their business. Other theories such as an upcoming recession, or an effort to depress rising wages are possible but less likely imo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 12:14:20'] The yield curve is inverted by a significant amount (2yr is 0.82 higher than 10yr at the moment).  Historically, that usually means a recession is coming.  It's also hard for me to imagine that the dramatic increase in interest rates over the past year won't be a pretty big shock to the economy. (There's usually a lag after the increases before the impact is seen so this year would be the expected time to see the effects.) I will be surprised if there isn't a recession this year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 12:48:19'] Sreamlining operations. But some companies like Twtr, Amzn, Meta, Fintech they need to reduce cost.  Tweeter was going to layoff 1/3 or more before the acquisition.

If they kept their organizing to the private sector, and focused on workers issues with the employers rather than acting as agents/piggy banks for democrat politicians they'd get a lot more leverage down here.Red state workers are not going to willingly join an organization that blatantly and unashamedly works with and/or funds their political adversaries.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-18 15:45:05'] So many comments here don‚Äôt understand what ESG is the the methodology used to develop the score and annual list. Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance aka ESG. Three prongs taken at equal weights. Most companies can get an easy score on the Social aspect but not always, same with Governance. Environment is different because the way it‚Äôs calculated is kind of antiquated. There‚Äôs really two main parts to a company‚Äôs score, the company‚Äôs own response to S&P to about 100 or so questions and 500-1000 data points collected. Then take into account that S&P regularly changes the methodology for calculation as well. Some companies know how to answer the questions better than some, which is why they stay on the list. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs Tesla‚Äôs issues, just pointing it out. We all know the oil and gas industry has some powerhouse PR as proven every time the have an oil spill. The data points include things like social and environmental campaigns run by the companies. Like when Exxon says they‚Äôre developing cleaner technologies to drill oil, we all know that it can never be clean but it‚Äôs ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù (take that with a big grain of salt) so they get good marks for it. We all know it‚Äôs BS but we turn a blind eye because we need gas. I read Tesla had racial bias and sexual harassment claims, all companies do, but being a tech company in the Bay Area will generally lead to more than one in Houston. Not that Tesla has more, but from my wife and MIL‚Äôs years in HR, people at tech companies feel more empowered to report compared to companies run by and with the ‚Äúgood ol boy‚Äù culture. There‚Äôs actually a big push in the oil & gas industry to change that, same for my industry - Supply chain & Logistics. Saying all that to say, this isn‚Äôt blow back against Elon for the twitter deal or crap like that, these were calculated weeks/months ago.Edit: if you want to know more than some click bait articles you can read up about it here: [S&P methodolgy](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/products-benefits/products/esg-evaluation)

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 13:51:21'] A lot of the problems with ESG right now seem to be around subjectivity.  An analyst decided that Tesla should have lower ratings than Exxon, which seems like the clearly "wrong answer" to most observers (even if Tesla doesn't treat employees well).We created a tool recently ([measurecarbon.co](https://measurecarbon.co)) that gives people info around GHG emissions from stocks they own. We just decided to present the data and let people decide for themselves, instead of trying to come up with a subjective ratings system.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-19 08:04:50'] I'm always curious to see how markets have evolved over time, and one way to do it is to see what the biggest companies are in different years. It's always interesting to see that different company win and lose and there's no constant winner. In some years like 2000 and 2020, tech wins out. But for 2005 or 2010 energy firms stand out on top. Neither there is a constant sector winner. Apple and Aramco (tech and energy) are now the top 2 but I doubt that will be the case. In the next 5 years, 10 years or 15 years, what companies do you think will come to the top?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 04:59:38'] This is literally your last chances get out of crypto before you see your money disappear.Never have so many Governments and banking heads around the world from China, UK, Europe, US identified crypto (especially Bitcoin) as an entity to be crushed.  They are literally telling you point blank that they are going to crush Crypto.  They have never worked together like this before.Their reasons are clear,  the anonymous nature of transactions leads crypto to organized crime and simply makes it too easy to hide revenue from the Government.  All Governments are worried about loosing tax revenue as a result of cryptocurrency transactions.They are attacking crypto along several fronts.1) Regulation.  Bring crypto exchanges into the current regulatory environment.  To crypto idiots, this looks like the establishment is finally going to adopt crypto. What it really does is setup legal arguments for the shutdown of these exchanges.  Why? Because there isn‚Äôt a crypto exchange on the planet that can meet organized crime regulations. They can‚Äôt, because crypto can‚Äôt be traced. 2) the introduction of regulated crypto currency controlled by the central bank. This is competition, designed to remove any sort of public backlash from the imminent removal of crypto as any possibility as a currency of transaction, and pushes crypto to the fringes of use. It also reduces crypto to a single purpose, as an asset exchange between official currencies.  This removes any sort of demand for crypto by replacing it with something the establishment Iikes.  Once this is introduced, the closing of unregulated coins in exchanges will start.  This is where crypto exchanges will only be able to sell you those coins that meet organized crime regulation requirements.  Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum will ever meet those requirements. 3) the new crypto does advance currency transactions.  The Feds new digital currency for instance has the capability to simply make credit cards obsolete.  That‚Äôs quite a shift in the industry. It will make waves. The waves will be all about this new crypto coin and how amazing it is for online transactions that are no longer hemorrhaging revenue to credit companies. This is where Bitcoin and Ethereum should have been.. but they‚Äôll never be allowed to get there, Central bank heads have said this already, very explicitly.  ‚ÄúBitcoin will never be used as a currency for transactions‚Äù.  <=== Google this, and see who said it.   While stability is important, that‚Äôs not the primary reason, although it‚Äôs an often used excuse. The primary reason is about control.  Currency use has always been about control. Cathy Wood, and Elon Musk are not in a position to influence policy around the world, and they are not large enough forces to overcome the establishment with respect to the use of currencies.  These are not the people who can protect your money if what I described comes to pass. It‚Äôs your money.  I just felt I had to warn you. Don‚Äôt say the writing wasn‚Äôt out there as literally every central bank has been telling people to stay away from Crypto due to regulations.

I could see this happening under a Trump administration for sure, and even under a Biden administration.  Lots of people love the convenience of Amazon, but I don't think they'll garner much public sympathy.  If the two units were separated that would make Walmart a true head to head with Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 14:54:49']  As a consumer the scan and go feature is exciting. I'll sign up but to try it. The many vendors on one Walmart.com is a turn off. Getting stuff from some random shop that I don't know and don't trust is why I left amazon. But I do think it will make more money for Walmart so it's likely a good move.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 16:04:35'] Seems like quite the battle. Walmart has old infrastructure (brick and mortar), and Amazon started later so they probably have more tech framework.For example, Walmart doesn't seem to have extremely-fast dropshipping, so I hypothesize their online order to warehouse to shipping sequence is inferior to Amazons. I would further that conversation by asking, who do we think will be able to implement drone-based shipping sooner?However, it is a strength of sorts for Walmart to have stores in many if not most cities. I would test this strength by considering two main types of online purchases: common items such as Crest toothpaste, and esoteric items such as a 0.25" derma-roller. Basically order an item that would exist locally in a Walmart store and one that wouldn't from their online store, and perform the same test at Amazon. Test which ones consistently ship faster. This should reveal some unseen infrastructure coefficients.As an extension of that common vs. esoteric item test, an aggregate analysis is due for probing the implications of ordering online + shipping and ordering online + in-store pickup. Walmart crushes in this regard, but Amazon could potentially add store fronts in their warehouses and/or shipping facilities, so it will be important to track that if you maintain that Walmart has a comparative advantage.As a Canadian, I find one drawback for Amazon is that, if an item ships from China, it's game over. It will take 2+ weeks, sometimes upwards of 2 months to arrive. Walmart doesn't seem to be as interested in these esoteric, low footprint items such as PCIe to 4 USB peripheral hardware for a computer.In addition to this difference between common and esoteric items for Amazon and Walmart, I find that Amazon's reputation seems to be worse today because, as a company, they seem to be orders of magnitude more sociopathic than Walmart in the ways they treat employees as time-tracked cattle and have issues with lacking intent for cleaning up bot-riddled fake reviews and counterfeit/low-grade third world companies. Amazon is a network of third party sellers. Walmart is one seller that acquires products and then sells them.I would ask the question, what will the future bifurcation be between frequency of online purchases vs. in-store purchases? If Amazon can use their current infrastructure as item pickup touchpoints, that brings Amazon pretty analogous to Walmart in terms of physical location saturation (and related logic). Shipping velocity strikes me as the most important attribute. In my opinion, that seems to be a critical factor in quantity of demand, more so than brand reputation. Both companies have significant economies of scale. Walmart seems less infested with both endogenous and exogenous dark triad vectors.And of course, make sure a person studies "dark shopping cart patterns": [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf) Both Amazon and Walmart seem to heavily deploy those grey area ethics techniques. At the moment, whoever is using more of those is probably capable of harnessing more sales if traffic is in a 1:1 ratio.Also don't forget Nike's recent movement to push transactions from external sources to their domain. This is significant, in my opinion, because it implies potential aggregate movement from centralization to decentralization. It begs the question, what other brands might try this, and who exactly is going to handle shipping when shipping velocity composed with total cost is among the primary concerns. Maybe we will see more aggregator websites with outbound links to shopping carts? I wouldn't want to assert much specifics here in the way of solutions, but an Occam's Razor will be converged upon via regression to the mean as free market mutations iterate from here, now.Also don't forget that Walmart's market cap is $417 Bil, and Amazon's market cap is $1.75 Tril. That's a difference by a factor of 3, almost 4. Amazon also owns data via AWS that relates to transactions on all websites and servers using their database stores, etc. In some ways, the limit of Amazons comparative advantage approaches disgustingly-great as the amount of compared metrics approaches infinity.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 17:16:10'] Both are solid stocks. I don't see Walmart facing any real threat, especially when it comes to food and the like. I'm not having fucking steaks delivered by Amazon but strangely enough I wouldn't mind it from Walmart.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 19:23:59'] I like Walmart and all, but Jeff Bezos is a once in a lifetime visionary. If I had to pick, I would much rather prefer investing with him over Walmart. You aren't going to see the explosive growth with WMT that you see with Amazon. Walmart+ won't be much of a gamechanger.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 19:58:47'] First your English is excellent, never apologize for it, I wouldn‚Äôt have known if you hadn‚Äôt said anything. While Walmart is huge they suffer an image problem. They‚Äôre seen as lower class, they‚Äôre like the Florida of retail. It will take years to overcome that image. They‚Äôve been doing these acquisitions for years now and not much has changed. Their website looks more like Sears than Amazon. I won‚Äôt say never since they have enough money to make a lot of progress but I‚Äôm not seeing anything of substantial interest here.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 12:15:18'] I think this kind of competition with these two behemoth will be good for the customer, but bad for the investor. Not sure I would invest in Walmart.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 14:55:59'] From an uneducated perspective, I think Doug McMillon has done a very good job to keep Walmart even in this conversation, especially when you consider he is a Walmart lifer and not a corporate suit.  You could argue he made a number of acquisitions that didn't show results but I would agree with your thought process that the value taken from those acquisitions in terms of knowledge and technology is as valuable as the price they paid.  Great post, and the comments are just as good.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 15:38:36'] Did you mention how Walmart started, WFS. Walmart fufillment services. They now have a fufillment center in Kentucky that's opened up in March and 3pls can start using it to fufill orders.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 17:16:21'] I've been thinking this too. Walmart has been investing heavily for a few years into online retail and I think this will be their breakout year. Few companies have the chops to even make inroads on Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 17:32:16'] Nice DD!
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 17:32:16'] AWS, prime video..It‚Äôs a no from me doh
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 18:33:21'] Love this thread.  I also think that WMT is the only real competitor to take on AMZM.  And they have put their money where their mouth is.  There can be two winners.  One thing Walmart will need to think through is competing with amazons third party platform. (And maybe they already have).  Amazon has higher margins and more total sales from their 3rd party vendors.  I hope that Walmart establishes the same.  Additionally, Walmart‚Äôs store base and grocery is good.  However, amazon is in talks with Simon mall, and their footprint is also fantastic.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 18:58:30'] The problem with walmart is on software side. Look at Amazon website and Walmart website. Plus Walmart shoppers are bargain bin shoppers. They wont subscrible to Walmart plus. I doubt they will get premium buyers to get subscription to walmart plus because of their reputation. Amazon has huge advantage with machine learning/AI plus echo/fire devices give them easy access to customer data. What does walmart have beyond their shopping data. That said Walmart will also thrive as they do have some moats around their stores plus I like their investment in Flipkart in India.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 19:19:18'] Amazon gets sales because the shipping is free and fast. End of story. Walmart could compete if they dialed this in more. Amazon can also stand to lose money on shipping if needed because other profitable sectors of their business can subsidize.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 20:00:01'] Gonna stick with AMZN on this one for now.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 20:20:50'] I think your money is safe in both stocks, but I'm going with AMZN. The have so many projects and are in many sectors.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 20:43:22'] I wish my position in Walmart was bigger than my position in Amazon. Especially like on a day like today. Plus I have been having a lot of problems lately with ordering from Amazon and then actually ever getting what I ordered and being able to get my money back like wtf. Walmart - even though it is Walmart - has always had superior customer service. Great research on this post!
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 20:44:27'] Hey OP, I think I agree with your consensus. I do feel that people think highly of amazon but their retail losses money big time and aws is one of few area where they make money. In long run I do feel Walmart and target both will give amazon run for their money. So I have prime but last 3 months I have been using target because I moved to new city and there is target close by, their app integration with coupon/ wallet is solid. I barley order few things that I can‚Äôt find at target on amazon but my first preferences are either target or Walmart app search and usually prices are lower on these compare to amazon. Amazon will keep growing into different areas and become behemoth that basically it will be part of larger eco system regardless of what happens to their e-retail market.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 21:13:47'] Just my opinion, as a millennial that loves both. I spend far far more money at Walmart. I would hazard to guess I spend 20x more there, especially in the grocery arena. I‚Äôm betting on Walmart, it really makes perfect sense for them to go this route. Yes they aren‚Äôt a tech company, but let‚Äôs be honest Amazon‚Äôs website isn‚Äôt a super complicated model to follow. Amazon‚Äôs tech is in AWS, not their website. Walmart has everything in place to make this happen, logistically speaking. They just need delivery drivers really. Personally I‚Äôm shocked to see people betting against Walmart, they aren‚Äôt the next sears. They‚Äôre proving to investors their ability to adapt which I think is huge.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 21:13:58'] Tldr?Amazon is a cloud company. Walmart trying to expand in an low margin cutthroat industry? Obv meal delivery is next
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 21:41:25'] I bought Walmart at $105 just over a year ago because of these very reasons. Feels good.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 21:43:12'] The other interesting thing about this is that I would expect Amazon to come under fire by anti-trust legislation sometime in the next few years. They have their hands in a million different pies. At some point, the government will likely step in and break them up. In that case Wal Mart could certainly start dominating in thia fight.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 22:49:10'] While you mention Flipkart, I think you should mention PhonePe. PhonePe is the second biggest mobile wallet transitioning to be a super app of sorts.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 03:41:00'] Isn't most of AMZN earnings/revenue from their servers?
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-02 06:47:46'] Walmart destroyed bonobos and modcloth, so I wouldn't even mention that üòÇ

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-03 03:43:35'] From RH Newsletter regarding Amazon's Ghost Grocery :This could be Amazon‚Äôs big grocery advantage...¬†over Instacart, Walmart, and DoorDash. E-grocery shoppers have to go¬†into¬†stores just like you and us to pick out your goodies before delivering them ‚Äî that's not very efficient.Speed:¬†All that pushing between shopping carts, little kids, and cheese-gawkers slows the process down. That doesn't happen in a Ghost Grocery.Reliability:¬†In regular stores, there's a decent likelihood that the pesto you ordered is gone. In Ghost Groceries, supplies are closely monitored (and no one storms the pasta aisle).Price:¬†This more efficient fulfillment method could allow Amazon to lower prices¬†or¬†rake in more profit.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-03 22:05:12'] Walmart‚Äôs online presence is shit, their website sucks, with that being said any improvement in their systems will be a catalyst for growth in sales.
