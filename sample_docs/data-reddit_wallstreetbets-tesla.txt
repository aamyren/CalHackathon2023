It‚Äôs sitting at $780B market which is ridiculous, Could it go back to $1T / or like $380/share? sure but honestly i doubt it, market is more logical than 2021, too much money has been lost.  We know we cant compare Tesla or their valuation but GM is a $50B mc, Toyota $200B.  Tesla shouldn‚Äôt be valued at 4xs Toyota, I dont hate on or doubt Elon but consumers will eventually burn out of Telsa‚Äôs style.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:27:21'] We need more stringent rules on allowing people to engage in options trading. Tesla is the number one company in terms of automative sales in the world. Naked short calls should be illegal

The creator lied his ass off about absolutely everything, compared to him Elon is trustworthy.  Its actually impressive how much bullshit was being pushed onto the masses and investors gobbling it all up,   despite absolutely everything being smoke and mirrors.None of the tech that the CEO/founder spoke about and which was crucial to making the company profitable actually existed. All completely made up.The fact that its value isn't zero is a miracle in itself.

I'll be amazed if they even release the cybertruck by then.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 08:27:22'] As someone who owns a drayage company in socal; the general consensus is H2 will win in the trucking industry. The issue is not fuel cell tech, its refueling infrastructure.. lets remind ourselves tesla had this problem at some point.  Good for Nikola, the H2 roadmap has been drawn out. I'd suggest some people do research on their FCEV tech and on the industry before making conclusions. People were excited about Telsa's BEV at first, but that hype has died down. Nikola starts mass FCEV production in 17 days.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 11:07:16'] Call me skeptical, but it feels like Tesla is going to report a big miss in cars delivered. Game theory wise Musk has to be seeing a severe slowdown in car orders, for him to go strike these charger deals. It was the one true advantage Tesla cars had in spite of all the other quality issues. He‚Äôs given it up, and will of course talk it up as big positive, which it won‚Äôt be for a few years as the number of Ford and GM EVs is negligible. So seems like he gave up his trump card prematurely to cover up something else. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 23:10:30'] Should be expected with direct to consumer sales. The price will change with supply and demand like it does at a dealership. We saw bunch of increases in 2021/2022 with the supply chain issues. Now we are seeing cuts when the demand slows because of the economy and interest rates.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:13:12'] Tesla's objective is to be able to make cars that everybody (well not actually everybody but you get the idea) can afford to buy. They have noted their prices have long been too expensive. So continued price cuts as conditions warrant or demand it is to be expected.The question is what impact do these have on margins.This is difficult to guess at as it often starts with the assumption that the cost for Tesla to build a car has not declined by a corresponding amount. Also, we have little insight into whether Tesla is in the process of a change that will cut costs in the near future allowing them to cut prices now at a hit to margins only to see those margins go back up as upcoming cost savings are factored in.Regarding comparing Tesla to others here... Tesla is very profitable and can afford to move these numbers as they determine necessary. The others are losing money on EV's and any cut to prices will mean their losses increase and risk their efforts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 03:16:34'] It would be faster to buy a new Tesla.  Than wait for an appointment to actually get a service appointment to fix your current Tesla.  That is the main flaw of Tesla‚Äôs zero dealership model.  Tesla has too many things going on the same time.  You‚Äôll have to suck it up as customer since you don‚Äôt have no other recourse.  Since Tesla controls everything.The traditional dealership model isn‚Äôt perfect.  But this allows carmakers to focus on designing and building better cars.  Without getting burdened by customer service support.  Since you have dealerships outsourced to handle consumer sales and maintenance service.  If you are unhappy with how your dealership treats you as a customer.  You can go to another dealership.  Or get you car serviced by an independent garage.  With Tesla you can‚Äôt even do that.  Tesla knows and controls everything that goes on with your car.  Tesla can even disable features remotely.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 16:40:25'] In order to get the full credit, your income taxes must be $7,500 or greater for the year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 18:56:50'] Wow the cars should cost in the low 30k‚Äôs now. That‚Äôs amazing in today‚Äôs crazy market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 17:20:53'] I don't make enough to take full credit. Those who have high income have 150000 income limitations
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 19:03:26'] But I though Elon was strongly against subsidies and handouts?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 19:11:01'] well its now cheaper than my crap box ICE car so I will be buying one
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 20:59:19'] Was debating on buying this.  The credit only applies if you owe taxes on fed or state level.  If you don't owe any taxes then you don't qualify for the credit.  If you owe 3k in taxes then you only get 3k credit from feds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 03:39:11'] Doesnt the rebate depend on your tax bracket as well
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 17:49:13'] That‚Äôs what aBIDENing to ‚ÄúCharging for all act‚Äù gets you. They strong armed him to come to terms with opening charging stations to other auto makers (Ford is the first example and won‚Äôt be the last) and in return he gets the green light for all Teslas qualifying for the tax credit resulting boost in sales.It‚Äôs all political negotiations between government and corporates. You give a little you take a little.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 16:13:01'] I thought once you hit so many units the credit went away??? This sounds like a US domestic manufacturing push. Did the rules change?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 19:35:19'] Could you sell your current Tesla and buy a new one and get the credit?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 23:03:43'] Still not buying one. Duck Elon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 00:42:21'] Damn, I don't like the tesla 3, but it's getting quite cheap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 14:56:48'] Nobody cares anymore. Anyone that's style conscious wouldn't buy one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 05:54:56'] Yep.., until ruling class decides they don‚Äôt like Musk any longer and changes the rules just for Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 18:26:20'] The socialization of the EV industry. Horrible!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 19:28:47'] here's another kicker... if your car is electric... when do you pay for road taxes to drive.its included in every gallon of gas?  it's just passing the buck.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 06:28:23'] Which car is best now BMW x3, Tesla X, Audi Q4, Volvo C 40, Lexus 450H?  These cars get $5,000 tax credit for plugging or electric.  Thank you
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 13:45:06'] Too bad my 2022 model y performance doesn‚Äôt qualify for a tax break!!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:21:11'] Iam just buying tesla model y right now,and we know the tax return for this year is over, and how to got a tax credit 7500?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 20:39:53'] isn't the tax credit related to the price you pay, as in "you are getting a tax refund for the amount of tax you paid for the vehicle", which would mean it's simply so expensive that taxes are $7,500 or more, so basically they are just advertising the fact the vehicle is now MORE expensive than previously, hence why you can claim the full tax back?or do I understand this wrong? because when I asked some car salesmen about the EV tax credits they just said you simply get the tax back on what you pay, so for eligibile models you just get a tax return that is no more than what you paid, with a max $7,500
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 19:27:58'] Moot point when dealers mark the cost up by $7500Edit: guys I‚Äôm regarded, I wasn‚Äôt being serious

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 13:14:37'] End of 2027 is about 3 1/2 years away. When Cathie made the prediction, Tesla was at ~$165 a share. To go to $2,000 would mean the stock goes about 12x in price.     3 1/2 years ago, Tesla stock was about $16 a share meaning in that time frame it is up 10x in price. That's crazy growth and she expects it to be *even crazier* going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 14:47:41'] Oh that so funny
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 10:14:13'] Yeah, I get a chuckle out of a $2000 price target in 4 years. No car company is even close to that and there is nothing special about a Tesla. Reality is, a Tesla is exactly what it should be, a rickety vehicle with tons of quality and fitment issues. I know the fan boys will rage and call me a hater but that's not it. The quality truly is laughable on the three cars owned by people I know. It's reminiscent of the quality of a Lada or that car on The Simpsons. "It gets 14 hectares per litre of kerosene." "Put it in H!"

Elon just goes around talking about robotaxis and the power of this software, that has been perpetually coming next year since 2019 at least, unlocking all this value for owners and the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:13:18'] To put in context there are about 500k FSD users in North America, having driven more than 100 million miles cumulatively. A total of 4k complaints, and probably less than 4k users with complaints cumulatively over a span of years is nothing. The only reason you haven't heard of ADAS complaints on other brands is because they aren't available on all trims and most of the users don't use them. Honda has its own phantom braking being investigated by NHTSA, and from my own ownership experience the Ioniq5 also has phantom braking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:32:48'] I saw this happen a few days ago. The guy drove past me pretty fast and my first assumption was a police chase but, I didn‚Äôt see no cops.

I can‚Äôt imagine anything more irritating than not controlling the car, but still having to pay strict attention to the road. The paying attention is the bad part of driving.When I can legally pass out drunk in the back seat or safely jerk off to porn on a busy highway, then we will have achieved full self-driving, until then, it is some flavor of ‚Äúassisted‚Äù.I will be satisfied once I have a car that:- can drive itself in stop-and-go traffic - has decent collision avoidance- has good adaptive cruise controlThese are all pretty well solved problems, so I am happy to wait for FSD until I‚Äôm too old to drive safely.

Did taxes in April 2022 the tax credit came out to a whopping $75.00   Tax credits is just another government  scam. You want us and force us to by electric cars then send us a rebate coupon for $7,500.00 to give to the dealer as a down payment  Also send us a rebate coupon for the $1,500 to $2,000 for the electrician to upgrade our homes electrical panels for fast charging

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 11:25:01'] Kind of, you pay the full price up front. Then maybe, over time if you add up every tax credit and money saved not buying gas, it will add up to the difference. Maybe.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 12:25:21'] Ironically Tesla has been using AI for the longest time in their self driving mode. Yet we can see they hit their limitations a few years ago. So what's next? A bigger GPU the size of an engine we can store in the frunk? Or will NVIDIA break the laws of physics to keep Moore's law alive? AI is decent technology but it's a FAD because the market thinks it has no limitations, but the market is too dumb to know that. As for Tesla, a decent electric car company that will suffer the fate of Cisco/IBM eventually.

One TSLA share bought prior to August 31st, 2020 would equal to 15 TSLA shares today.She's probably bang on.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 17:30:06'] Elon doesn't care about margins yet they have the highest margins in the EV industry. He's closing the door on competitors that are 5-10 years behind.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 20:26:46'] So far all electronics become exponentially cheaper and better. Cars are much more regulated than TVs of course. Will that keep it from happening.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 20:42:26'] Idk about $2000 but Tesla model Y will probably be like a Toyota corolla or a little bit more; around 24-28k because they are about the same quality. Probably happens when Toyota or  others start selling cheap electrics.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 00:41:33'] In theory a fully autonomous road network, with no private car ownership (by citizens) could be worth many trillions, that's precisely why Tesla has such a bonkers valuation, no one's looking at Tesla and thinking a relatively small car manufacturer is worth 0.5tr but they are looking at Tesla thinking that it's worth more than that if it becomes a big player in the ev charging, battery and autonomous road network industries. There is no doubt that governments and large corporations strongly desire an autonomous road network because it will save so many hours in travel time, it's the next big efficiency driver that they're obsessed with because it lets them stay on the infinite growth carousel for a little bit longer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 02:47:01'] I think she is right. Elon sells tesla cheap for the obvious reson, self driving, all tesla cars has a locked feature of self driving, i think he is going to charge people for unlocking and using that feature, he will make more money than the price cuts he is making now. He doesn't need to develop or do anything just unlock an existing feature and make money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 22:35:45'] Im about to get a bolt euv instead of a model 3 for the wife.38 MSRP with super Cruise, panoramic roof redlineSuper cruise is the best system today. On the interstates and major highways it will drive you from on ramp to off ramp. Doesn't mean it'll be the best system forever But a 31k if you qualify for the full 7500 rebate car that has useful cargo and kinda drives itself sometimes is pretty neat. Better than a base un optioned model 3

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 21:53:40'] High margin less sale, or low margin but high sale. I think Elon is going to go the same route as Apple, selling iPhone is profitable, but Apple makes a lot of money with AppStore. Tesla has the potential to do well with added services and merchandises
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 22:22:36'] Elon had everyone pay crazy marked up prices for Tesla‚Äôs so that the rest of us could get them for cheap and he still wouldn‚Äôt loose. Is that it?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 09:02:58'] This is why I hate hate hate the strategy of selling naked options.  Selling cash covered puts and covered calls is bad enough.  The asymmetric payoff distribution masks the risk of catastrophic loss.  If you pocket the juicy premium of 10 contracts during earnings, why not sell 50 or 100 contracts next time?  If they get in the money, just "roll them over" (code for double down and risk turning a bad loss into a catastrophic one).  On top of that, the exposure you have increases as you lose more money.  The 10k options you sold are now worth 50k.  Not only is your margin crying bloody murder, your position is now bigger.  The horrors of negative gamma is a sight to behold.And whereas everyone **knows** that buying options is an outright gamble, for some reason some think selling options is a ticket to consistent gains.  As if anyone with a margin account can become consistently profitable if they just follow this one simple trick.  Fucking morons.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 08:47:22'] Why did you go with a different strategy? It seemed like you had success scalping the open with long calls/puts but you switched to credit spreads? Why???

POST_TEXT: b'So I was making really good trades at the beginning of the year. I had a Tesla id been leasing for over a year and was considerably well off. I got greedy making trades thinking "this was my shot" and took some huge losses back to back to back. Last month I kept taking loss after loss, so bad to where I had to start selling stuff to afford rent for my apartment. I ended up losing my job last month as well. Somehow im still in the green YTD on my webull (idk where that money went) but my wells fargo bank account is currently -$2700 and i dont plan to pay it back. I usually just ghost debt collectors and i could care less about my credit score rn, i just need to make some good trades to fix all of this.\n\nToday i just rode the bus to my amazon job interview. On the way back there was a huge group of artistic kids on the bus. I cant help but think the man above was trying to tell me something, like I was one of them. The worst part is, those kids probably have more money than me right now.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 16:31:25'] Dude... You don't "need a few trades to make it back". You gambled and you lost. You then started selling shit because you gambled with money you needed. I tell you this not to be a jerk, but because you need to hear it. For someone with a negative bank account, you really should care more about your credit. Not having or using credit is fine if you have the cash to back it up. Take the plasma money, put it in the bank, and start clawing back. When you have 3 months of cash, you can consider your gambling addiction again.

Lost $20k in a day.It‚Äôs crazy to think you make thousands and thousands a day with options, but also lose just as much as even more if you end up on the wrong side of a trade. Risk management is preached by all the top traders and here I am throwing away thousands a day just to flip a quick 5x a day. My favorite part is going from making $10k a day to barely $150.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 22:47:47'] There's a tremendous difference between gambling... being delusional, wishful -- and actually being a wise, experienced, tactful, bold and intelligent traderThe difference between the two is literally just a few adjustments of bolts in your trading head process, which can make all the difference between a $200 trader and a two million dollar traderHuge success in trading won't happen overnight for no one.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 23:39:43'] It will get better my guy, but maybe focus on investing for awhile before uhmm... WSB inspired "Trading". Focus on the income/job, work hard, so hard that you do not have time to trade and can rely on your knowledge of the market to just make sound investments. If completely unsure some ideas I like are:1. Pick stuff you use everyday and/or like 2. Death and taxes3. scarce resources (or finite like BTC) The writing is good, dunno if text generation is gonna be very valuable moving forward either tbh. Or moreso, human text generation. Copywriter and technical writers among other specifics (like authors) may not be such a good... Side hustle (?) or a focus. Cause the AI stuff. Note: housing is practically finite and deflationary. It also does "amortize/depreciate" aka deflate or get destroyed. Atleast until we have autonomous mining, processing, supply chain infrastructure/logistical infrastructure, and building automation. Then I would think that its supply should maybe inflate to a bit beyond maximum future demand. But that's more complicated and there are many other arguments and ideas that may be more reasonable and I discover them tomorrow. Anyways, good luck, don't just gamble friend.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 13:22:13'] At first I thought it was serious, then I thought it was a joke, then I read the edit and some of your comments and realize this is serious. You should really consider some counseling / therapy, this sounds like an addiction that has and will continue to ruin your life. Chasing the highs of big wins (improbable) or some internet points, which is just strangers laughing at you for your stupidity because you wrote something funny at the cost of whatever money you've scraped together (happening right now + inevitable in the future if you continue), will not serve you well. If you feel that you're TRULY happy doing this then that's fine, different strokes for different folks, but it more likely sounds like you may need to reframe some things, given that you thought you were considerably well off and a couple of bad trades took away everything you own. The fact that you have the requisite number of previous encounters with a debt collector that you can say 'I usually do x' is extremely concerning. Something tells me there's more wrong going on than right here. I'm just an internet stranger, so take all this and toss it out the window if you want, but I'm genuinely worried because it sounds like you're going to be struggling to recuperate just enough to make a big bet and lose it all in an endless cycle. Please get help.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 21:29:00'] I‚Äôve been there man. It sucks. You need to stop gambling. Don‚Äôt romanticize it. There‚Äôs nothing whimsical or beautiful about sabotaging your future financial success on coin flips. Just get back on your feet and get start selling cash secured/covered options if you still want to try and get an edge. I started doing that since beginning of the year. Took two years off trading, made back everything I lost (about 47 grand) and now write weekly options on big caps. It‚Äôs nice. I can go slightly out the money and make $400-500/week. If the technicals look right I‚Äôll go closer ITM and get more. I‚Äôm up 8 grand this year doing this and it‚Äôs been really nice looking at my bank account and seeing it gradually climbing up every month.Two years ago I also built a spreadsheet to track my checking account and my brokerage. I‚Äôve had some sideways months especially from holding stock in 2022. But it‚Äôs never gone lower.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 13:49:42'] Not a $500,000,000 mistake, a $100,000,000 gain
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 10:57:27']  I can see a few reasons why someone might argue that Elon Musk is a bad CEO when it comes to financial decision-making.First, Tesla's decision to sell nearly $936 million of Bitcoin in Q2 2022 to secure a $64 million profit can be seen as short-sighted. If Tesla had waited until now to sell, it could have made an additional $500 million. This suggests that Tesla sold its Bitcoin too soon, potentially missing out on significant gains.Second, Tesla's decision to purchase $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in February 2021 at an average price of $36,000 was also risky. Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and its price can fluctuate rapidly. By investing such a large sum of money into Bitcoin, Tesla was taking a significant risk. The fact that the value of Tesla's remaining Bitcoin holdings is almost 15% below the procurement value from February 2021 suggests that this investment has not paid off as well as hoped.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:42:50'] All they need to do is integrate NACS into their charging stations, it's not like Tesla is saying you can only use NACS at Superchargers. Some people just don't understand how easy it is to change, it'll cost a pretty penny but might as well do it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 22:11:40'] Elon needs to save us CHPT bagholders and just buy it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:14:00'] >The news that GM is now using Tesla's North American charging plug standard is definitely not good news for ChargePoint and Blink. The fact that the three largest EV manufacturers are all using the same standard means that there is little incentive for other companies to continue supporting the CSS standard. Even with adapters, it is likely that many people will switch to Tesla's more widely used system. This could lead to a consolidation of the industry around Tesla's North American standard, which would be bad news for ChargePoint and Blink.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 08:23:30'] The critical questions are market share and margins. The EV market mushroomed last year and Tesla was capitated by capacity and for a while there Federal rebate availability (the December pause). Keep in mind - Tesla's COGS and production costs have dropped substantially.  So the game to them is that eve present dial - turn right and keep the increased margins - turn left and accept lower margin to increase (or sustain) share.  The problem is the market is bifurcating.  Truck margins, sedan margins, crossover margins are all unique with unique competitors.  Just because they are all EV's does not mean you lump them in one bucket.  No different than comparing a Peterbuilt to a F150 - differentiation. I suspect the Model Y discount was partially because it has all the latest advances and actually has the best margins.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 16:54:39'] They were supposed to cut the price of their cars, not their stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 17:12:37'] Part of the issue is that people were buying Teslas, specifically the S, as a status symbol. They were hard to get, so the demand went crazy. And then they came out with the model 3 that happens to look almost identical to the S. At first it was great, everyone who wanted an ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù EV could now grab one, and they were still relatively hard to come by, so still had the status attached to it. And now, that‚Äôs not the case. So not only have they saturated the ‚ÄúEV buyer‚Äù market with the low priced 3, they are readily available, so have killed off the demand from people who only care about status and having the next best thing. IMO they are in trouble if the tax credits are ever fully removed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 18:00:44'] Idk if this is bearish or bullish.  Seems bearish short-term but longterm the price of EVs has to come down if mass adoption and capturing nearly all the market is a goal.

They did something with Tmobile, allowing SpaceX satellite service pretty sure in return TSLA will utilize cell towers from Tmobile. Sure am missing more. Also  Tesla, on the other hand, has just $5 billion in long-term debt, and plenty of cash to show for it. In fact, the company has $22 billion in free cash flow, meaning that its cash minus debt gives it a $17 billion surplus. General Motors long term debt for 2022 was $75.921B

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 17:43:34'] Competition is now here for Tesla, later this year and next for the US market (GM Equinox and Blazer), but I think more concerning should be Teslas China rivals.  I have a hiking friend who loves his Tesla 3 and we are quite content with our Chevy Bolt. But the EV market in the US is no longer just Tesla and the China market is quite competitive.Tesla may be able to survive all of this and thrive.  I don't have a crystal ball, but I look at their multiple (including for the last 4 years) and my butt shrivels.  What is priced in is growth, growth, growth.  And, Tesla might achieve this.  I'm a bit dubious.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 16:10:19'] Instead of looking at misleading relative percentages, [see the raw numbers for Q1](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q1-2023-ev-sales/):**Top selling EVs in the US**1.    Tesla Model Y - 95,3622.    Tesla Model 3 - 54,9543. Chevrolet Bolt EV/EUV - 19,7004. VW ID.4 - 9,7585.   Tesla Model X - 6,4656.   Rivian R1T - 6,2137.   Hyundai Ioniq 5 - 5,7368.   Ford Mustang Mach-E - 5,4079.   Tesla Model S - 4,84910.    Ford F-150 Lightning - 4,291**Top 5 EV brands in the US**1.    Tesla - 161,6302.    Chevrolet - 19,7003.    Ford - 10,8664.    Volkswagen - 9,7585.    Rivian - 7,946Rivian's truck just lapped Ford's, not to mention the Ioniq 5. Ford and Hyundai are *still* having trouble competing against Tesla's 100k models. This is what a company in trouble looks like? All those people allegedly canceling their orders and yet Tesla still outsells their nearest competitor by an order of magnitude. That's what happens when you take too long to invest in battery supply chains.Edit: If Reddit's botfarms are mad at the above, they gon get really mad when they figure out legacy automakers have to maintain their depreciating ICE inventory & infrastructure while simultaneously spending even more money to shift over to EVs. And they have to do that while their own EV production is unprofitable. And also trying to keep dealerships happy with with less profitable EV maintenance and their strong tendency to markup their products far past their sticker price. That's a nice balancing act for other auto companies to look forward to for the foreseeable future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 13:48:50'] Yeah and the other companies are struggling to break even on their EVs. It‚Äôll be bearish on TSLA if a company is actually able to make a profitable EV at 50k price range.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 18:30:15'] This is true, but let's just point out the entire situation.1) Ford, GM, and others are LOSING money on every EV they make. Profitability is still far off.2) ICE automakers are cannibalizing their sales. So while they sell more EV's they are selling fewer ICE vehicles.3) Tesla is simultaneously improving margins while dropping the price of their cars. Other companies don't have as much leverage to cut prices as they're already producing negative cashflow from each sale.The big question is do these trends continue? If so, Tesla's EV market share reverses and continues to climb. If not, Tesla is likely very expensive, particularly if the thesis is their most profitable business will be in selling EV's. Some think that energy, robotics, FSD, etc will be the bulk of their business.Remains to be seen, but the market share numbers alone simply don't tell enough of the story.Positions: None
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 14:35:33'] This is actually pretty surprising because other EV makers are still supply constrained. They are still ramping up their supply.

But let's not forget, in the world of electric vehicles, it's not just about having the biggest share of the pie, it's also about baking a pie that everyone wants a slice of. With the EV market set to grow and more models on the horizon, it will be interesting to see which companies rise to the occasion and which ones get left in the dust

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 00:16:23'] It will continue to lose marketshare as more and more automakers ramp up EV models. And the EVs from the other big auto competitors are very competitive in regards to features. Auto-pilot I think will become a dying technology due to price-point vs driver-assisted tech (where the driver has more autonomy vs a car that just drives itself). I think evidence of this is the fact that Tesla continues to make cuts based on slowing demand. Slowing demand is largely due to other options on the market. Tesla will no longer be the most unique EV. In 5 years tesla‚Äôs share will be more like 35% once auto manufacturers go into more large scale EV production. We are still in the baby stages of what will be a huge EV market in 5 years
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 08:02:42'] The pie is getting bigger.  This is a denominator thing. Tesla is not sitting on unsold cars and can sell every unit produced with more factories online.  And despite price drops they are holding their margins due to design and production improvements. GM's growth is from a poor start to an acceptable level although their margins are very bad especially on the Hummer. Ford's Lightning is a laughing stalk and they cannot give them away now that the reviews are in. (A truck that cannot tow.)   US Manufacturers are not the worry. Asian manufacturers - Hyundai, Kia etc are. They are accepting lower margin because they have realized the "premium" for EV/Hybrid is fairly low.  Their lineup is in the $32K to $70K range - below Tesla currently. But you don't get anywhere near as much range etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:36:08'] Get used to 'more price competition'. BYD ready to enter the US market.[https://www.newsweek.com/china-electric-cars-us-elon-musk-tesla-plans-1789955](https://www.newsweek.com/china-electric-cars-us-elon-musk-tesla-plans-1789955)
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 10:01:13'] No biggie. Ford is guiding 2023 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $9 billion-$11 billion so they can afford more price cuts in their EV unit.They're projecting to sell 10X as many EVs in 2023 (600k) as they did in 2022 (60k). And producing 2 mil EVs by 2026.If 2023 numbers hold true then it's $5k loss per EV sold, which looks like they're around the corner from being profitable in the EV business.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:03:28'] Unless other makers hone their manufacturing, Tesla will continue take an outsized portion of the market. Ford loses quite a bit on every EV they sell. They are investing in new factory so we'll see what outputs can look like.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 10:01:36'] Say anything to keep the stock price high, ignore the fact that they make $60,000 trucks that most Americans can‚Äôt afford and the fact that they make no sedans.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:57:17'] Tough talk for someone who has -40% margins per car, towards someone with +25% margin.Come back when you are doing break even per car sold Ford.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 09:19:09'] Also Ford - We lose 40k per ev sold and 2 Billion a year on EVs
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 10:53:25'] Also ford: +$20000 market adjustment, $4000 in dealership extras.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:55:06'] Thank you CEO obvious...
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:23:22'] Ford: we can make shitter cars at a loss Tesla! Be warned!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 09:20:13'] The unfortunate reality is that Ford already sells all their EVs for a loss and will continue to do so for years to come. Pricing competition hurts them far more than it does Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 09:48:06'] Yeah right. My local ford dealer keeps emailing me: ‚Äúwe have an f150 lightning available rt now for 90k‚Äù
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 13:59:48'] Didn't Ford just recently announce they lost 2 billion on EV ???
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:09:54'] lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:31:03'] Is this the same Ford that raised the price of their EV trucks by five figures while Tesla dropped the price of all their vehicles?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:40:42'] Lol Ford is losing 3B selling EVs. We're coming for ya Elon.....

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 20:00:16'] Make a good priced AWD mini van that gets 400 miles a charge and sell a million in a year or two. The camper mini camper option would sellout every year. What are you waiting for?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 20:19:53'] I've just got to jump in here!  First time commenting on wsb. I bought a Volvo 740 Turbo brand new with 0 miles in 1989, it's a 1990. Still own it, I've taken good care of it. I have less than 180K miles on it.  At this point, I'll just "will it" to a family member!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 23:15:38'] Fuck Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 23:44:58'] Lol Tesla is effed. They have no moat.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 10:28:01'] Ford will lose money hand over fist until they actually do a properly designed F-150 Lightning. It‚Äôs difficult to cut costs when you‚Äôre trying to mass produce what‚Äôs essentially a heavily modified ICE chassis.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 16:10:31'] Tesla margins will get even better with their next generation of EVs. They've completely reinvented the way cars are built. If Tesla can solve their quality issues I don't see how Ford can compete with them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 09:21:21'] Short Ford. They're in trouble. Mere projection here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:09:13'] Thank you Ford. Make EV more affordable for the common people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:20:24'] From a company that lost three billion on EV sales last year lol. Okay
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:22:40'] Ford is losing 25K per EV they sell. That's without them cutting any prices.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:24:29'] No. Shit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:08:46'] I think their lightening/f-150 thing is a grand slam. They don‚Äôt have significant competition here. They should creat a bazillion versions of that just like they do with the IC F150.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:39:16'] Also Ford, ‚Äúwe expect a 3 billion loss from our EV unit‚ÄùFarley needs to step down
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:24:37'] Unlike Tesla, Ford just posted 2 billion loss a year. Makes sense to threaten Tesla. Especially when your entire new business strategy is, ‚ÄòBecome more like Tesla‚Äô.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 10:40:07'] Of course there will be but can the ICE industry shake their old school stigma and overrun the innovative newcomers?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 13:09:42'] Why is everyone here just commenting about ford? Every single car manufacturer is converting to EV. End of the day Tesla will be just another car company. Mobile eye or some AV company will provide the ADAS system to compete on that front. Just boggles my mind that people think Tesla will hold car market share dominance like Apple does for phones. The car industry is not the same.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 09:19:32'] Sure, but definitely not from ford LMAO. Entire company operated at a net loss last year, every EV was a negative margin.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 10:55:48'] No thanks.  I like my 2500 HD Diesel with the 10 speed transmission.  I‚Äôll never own anything else.  Ever.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 09:53:43'] Furd is def a moneymaker! They‚Äôll built it cheaper and make up on the damn thing tearing up every 3000 miles. Then the dealer can add on their ‚Äúmarket adjustment‚Äù so insurance premiums can be higher for all!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 10:47:13'] ITT: People who expect older companies to automatically be green in their new EV departments.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 10:23:18'] Tesla doesn‚Äôt have competitive advantage in EV yet. Based on the recalls, crashes, failure in FSD still a long way to go.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:51:17'] I do like Ford for to hold rn.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:18:47'] # Oh, is ford planning to steal another few hundred billion USD from the taxpayer again?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 11:52:03'] Won't do anything for the switch to electric until we get the proper grid for it. Not to mention how so many people can't afford to buy homes, thus can't have home chargers, thus won't buy an EV.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:24:54'] I own TSLA puts but man aren't they bored of repeating the same shit every time? All the automakers have been saying shit like this for years, it's boring and the yearly results have shown that they aren't doing shit that TSLA couldn't counter. Plus non-TSLA EVs are at the mercy of TSLA having monopoly over a lot of battery related IPs from storage to charging. They will continue to be pressed down by TSLA unless they somehow manage to find a better battery solution that's not lithium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:25:24'] So they say
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 12:28:33'] Hmmm let‚Äôs see what lithium prices have to say about all this‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 13:47:13'] Lol Tesla makes around 9k net profit. It is hard for any other car companies to match up to that level. Tesla is far ahead in EV game and they have automation in place through which they can build cars continuously in Giga factory.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 14:18:42'] You mean you remove an extra mile of unnecessary copper from the mach E so now you're going to reduce the price...

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 17:47:23'] I think they already foresaw it and dropped their prices.Unless Ford intends to undercut them.Or maybe Ford is really behind the news curve, which wouldn't surprise me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 21:46:15'] Aren't they losing money for every ev sold? How can they lower the prices more
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 22:16:53'] It's about time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 00:11:32'] Ford lost $2.5 billion last year on EVs and will lose over $3 billion this year if they cut prices they will lose even more.Their margins on Mach E are negative -40%

Ford CEO well there is no certain timeline to these statements lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 06:18:10'] As someone who has tested a majority of the EVs out there. I can tell you safely, that Tesla's sales will drop dramatically in the next few years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 07:08:53'] That‚Äôs great to hear!!! There‚Äôs going be explosion üí• of EV sales this year. $30k Chevy Equinox and $25k Tesla Model 2. I‚Äôm buying only Made in America cars üá∫üá∏ üí™‚ö°Ô∏è
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 07:22:33'] We‚Äôve had great luck with Ford over the years, owning several trucks and SUV‚Äôs. Unfortunately many Ford dealers are out a minimum of 1 month or more on service making it hard to keep a vehicle on the road. As far as the new lightning F150 at 90k+, I‚Äôll pass‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 07:55:38'] Of all the things I will absolutely never do in my entire life, buying a Ford vehicle, much less an EV, is definitely one of them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 12:17:56'] Western car makers already get their asses handed to them in the chinese market this year...which happens to be about 40% of their sales.VW had to cut prices by half for ID3 and ID4, and even BMW dropped their prices by 13500‚Ç¨ through their range of BEVs.China dominates the BEV, just like western companies had dominated the ICE.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:13:24'] Huge price cuts and slowing growth paints a picture of market saturation. People that want a Tesla own one. Some will buy another, but there‚Äôs a lot more competition now. Tesla has some unique advantages, but there‚Äôs plenty to be dissatisfied about as well.Teslas solar business is about to take a hit with the end of solar friendly policies in California. Tesla moving its headquarters out of California was stupid, regulators are taking a much more critical look at the safety of its autopilot and FSD. A California driver was recently convicted of a felony for an accident that happened while using FSD. Teslas driverless car tech is a fantasy if they are not the ones held responsible when it failsThere is just so much wrong with how Tesla is valued‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 19:11:11'] Tumbles?  Wow I didn‚Äôt realize deliveries went down!  Try a search for Tesla deliveries over the past five years.  Driving, there are more and more Tesla cars on the road.  Still best (and fastest) electric or nonelectric vehicles on the market, don‚Äôt care what Elon does.  Drive 200 miles for like $9 charge that takes 15 minutes while watching Netflix or TikTok, no issues there.   Fun to drive, and yes self driving is pretty great, just got the update to Tesla vision.  Funny how statistics can be made up.  Just compare margins w ford or gm or Toyota or anyone else.  And no Tesla not just an automaker, energy storage and solar still ramping huge, more factories being built and planned.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:53:43'] It's partly due to liberals not liking Elon these days, but I also think that most people just don't want EVs yet.  Combine that with increased competition, and Tesla is bound to lose market share.

I am a huge Ford fan (over 7,ooo shares)Musk can price them out and that is exactly what he is doing. It is simple math he wants to control  market share. All the majors are in their infancy as far as EVs go. Tesla is 10x more mature Battery wise charging wise ETC, Musk wants to grab it now and will pay up to do it. We shall see ?? but one thing I know show me an emotional investor and 90% of the time I will show you someone who lets his emotions steal his money. I could give a fuck less what Musk says .

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 12:06:51'] Tesla products are not mature. They don't serve the average consumer they serve a few buyers who are jazzed about "new-tech". I'm okay with that. Note to Tesla though, cutting and jacking the price for products doesn't improve the demand side. At all. It actually discourages entering the market, because it probably will go down next week, and it discourages entering the market, because it's overpriced for the market. It also sends a message to the investor class that you don't know WTF you are doing. Off my soap box....

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 00:25:59'] Reality is that the car is absurdly overhyped and most people living in the real world simply don‚Äôt want one. I‚Äôve said for years the biggest bear case against this company isn‚Äôt the financials or Elon musk being a jackass, it‚Äôs that after the early adopters, there isn‚Äôt going to be demand for the product and I still fully believe that. I honestly don‚Äôt give a shit about professed politics. The corporate world is chock full of glaring hypocrisy to the point if people actually bought products only from those who they agreed with they‚Äôd be living in a commune in the California desert.The problem is that the car is‚Ä¶a car. In a couple of ways I suppose it‚Äôs better than an ice? But in most ways I care about it‚Äôs worse. It‚Äôs more expensive, it‚Äôs less convenient to refuel, and I don‚Äôt want a giant touchscreen as my only option for controls. I‚Äôve ridden in several and I left just not that impressed. When I‚Äôve talked to owners about FSD I‚Äôm left stunned at the level of stupidity. It doesn‚Äôt fucking work. At all. And yet owners act as if it does. But they barely even use it except to show it off to other people. Basically what they‚Äôve done is taken a car that must be fully manually driven and sort of automated the absolute easiest parts of driving.But real FSD is hard because of all the other subtle parts which is the same reason AI in general is hard and those problems are many, many years from being solved. But Elon and his followers perpetually promise that those parts will be solved in months. I believe Elon knows better but is cool with deceiving people as he‚Äôs clearly demonstrated over and over while his followers are just ill informed and stupid. If Tesla becomes mainstream it will not be in any way because of its unique ability to automate driving.I believe the fair value is probably somewhere around a BMW or a luxury car brand which is basically the space they play in. So that is to say probably around 1/20th of where it trades currently.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 08:21:28'] The original tweet is wrong.  Musk knows full well his behavior affects the stock price. He knows this because his entire career, fame and fortune is wholly tied to his behavior.  Tesla is a shit company that is over-valued to the point of being a scam.  This is long-established and well documented.  People ignore it because of Musks behavior and public persona.  Tesla‚Äôs share price is exclusively about Musk and has nothing to do with Tesla the company.  The company is mostly a bust when you remove Musk from the equation and treat it like literally any other company, especially other car companies.The same is true of literally everything Musk has ever touched.  All his own ideas and business have failed with lengthy records of him stealing and taking credit for the work of others while his own work is trash.  The only businesses that have done even remotely OK have been because they are heavily subsidized by government directly or through government contracts (like Space x). The fact people would - even for a second - think Musk doesn‚Äôt know full well his behavior affects the stock price is shocking to me. It‚Äôs an indication much of the world is still extremely ignorant about this guys past and history and record‚Ä¶.and have fallen for the exact same brainwashing bullshit they are now saying Musk is clueless about.  Musk is doing what‚Äôs he‚Äôs always done.  It‚Äôs the only trick in his book.  The problem isn‚Äôt Musks behavior today.  The problem is people are finally (albeit extremely slowly) starting to see its all just a grift.  Musk isn‚Äôt Tony stark.  He never was.  Musk sold everyone a lie, based purely on personality and behavior, and people have blindly swallowed it for many years for some reason. And he‚Äôs made billions for his efforts conning people.Shame on Musk?  As the saying goes, ‚ÄúFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on all of us.‚Äù  Maybe if people these days weren‚Äôt so over-zealous to believe lies and bullshit, we wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation we are currently in socially and politically and economically, etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 17:41:42'] I‚Äôll tell you why you should buy Tesla.   The US Federal government thanks to the inflation reduction act will literally be raining federal tax credits (cash) to hedge funds, private equity, and other companies that invest into EV sustainability.  30 cents for every dollar spent on these initiatives will be given back to be exact in the form of a tax credit that can be sold.   Do you understand what this means and the amount of companies that will become the next EV pioneers to get back 30% for everything they spend?  These types of tax credits (cash back) will even have companies like Chevron scratching their heads thinking should we open another rig or take that money and become EV charging station manufacturers and be guaranteed to get 30% of the investment back.  What does this all mean?  It means the company selling EV cars and most established in EV (Tesla) will have most to gain as a result of all this investment from the tax credit hungry venture capitalist looking for a 30% guaranteed return from an investment.  There will be close to $500 billion worth of federal credits printed over the next 10 years.  It will not be abnormal for even small time people to be able to buy a federal credit on the resale market for 90 cents on the dollar from one of these venture capital offices that has a shit ton of them to sell.  If you owe 100k in federal liability in the years to come you will be able to buy your federal liability from a VC for 90k cash and save yourself 10k in liability to the federal government for buying your liability instead of paying it.  Large businesses will do this also to a huge scale.  Owe 10 million in liability hit up VC office that invested in EV initiatives and buy $10 million worth for $9 million cash.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 18:35:45'] I feel dumber for having read this.  You think a 30% tax credit on qualifying expenditures equals a 30% return ? Did you forget about the expenditures part of that equation ?  And even if these credits were tradeable. Wich I'm highly skeptical of that being true.  Why would any company sell a credit for less than its value vs using that credit of .30  to offset the expenses it incurred of 1.00.  This is an incentive for companies to spend toward electrification. It's not free money. It's not a gaurenteed return.  They won't be sold back and forth on the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:36:52'] I own a large percentage of my portfolio in tesla, and do agree I wouldn't buy any more with their revenue continuing going down but I don't think it makes sense to compare telsa margins to companies that are primarily software companies. Rivian has proved, that tesla has more of a moat than one would think since they lose more money per car then tesla ever has. Public perception has always trumped fundamental's with telsa  and for some reason the company and its CEO have become addicted to negative press.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 12:38:04'] Tesla's meteoric rise has been an incredible feat to watch, even for those who aren't interested in cars. While Tesla started as an upstart, Tesla's incredible success has cemented the company in the ranks of the leading motor manufacturers. Albeit one that strives to progress and innovates in a new way. It is becoming increasingly clear that Tesla has become just another car company. As Tesla begins to enter more segments of the market, its focus on technological advancements and green innovation ensures that Tesla remains ahead of the pack when it comes to revolutionary changes. Still, at its core, Tesla is now just another car manufacturer striving to provide excellent products and customer service.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 06:10:38'] Sort of, more or less, yes. It needs to be valued the way car companies are valued or close to it, because for all intents and purposes that's mostly what it is. One could make the argument: solar, energy, etc. However, that's a small part of Tesla's revenues. One could also make the argument that Tesla is ahead of its competitors on self-driving, but their competitors are doing the same thing; it's not enough. Do they deserve to trade a multiple in the 30s while other car companies trade at 6?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 09:24:54'] The Tesla bubble was all based on ‚ÄúHopium‚Äù that Tesla was the next Apple and that their AI driving technology was going to revolutionize the transportation market. It may eventually do so, but for now the promised full AI driving technology has not emerged since it was promised in 2017. So for now, Tesla is a car company, a very good car company, but it sells very expensive cars and there is a recession and rising interest rates, so no surprise to see their share price dropping

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 10:33:45'] Teslas have several dozen software enabled capabilities that no other car has. It has highest margins in the industry. It is definitely a car company. Apple is definitely a phone company, but to mistake it for ‚Äújust another phone company‚Äù would have been a mistake and it was a mistake that many people made. Some differences between Tesla and others:- Tesla has more data on their cars and customers than any other car company. - Tesla doesn‚Äôt have a dealership network- Tesla doesn‚Äôt have union workforce- Tesla can play video games, access a web browser, watch Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, Twitch, Disney Plus- Tesla owners can hop on a zoom call- Tesla has a proprietary charger network- Tesla has a telemetric based insurance product you can purchase in the app- Tesla has a built in 360 degree security system you can view live from you phone- Teslas can sync with each other to play a light show- Tesla owners can create their own light show for their tesla to play- Tesla sells a $15,000 software package that has a 5-10% global take rate- Tesla has a $7,000 package with a similar take rate- Tesla is the only car company that has ever pushed regular software updates that add significant features. No other car company is even close.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 07:42:52'] Tesla will follow the example of Ford and the model T anytime a competitor ( who is selling at a loss)! Gets close to Teslas price they will lower that price till demand is equal or better than their production. The more the innovate and increase production the lower the cost to produce their cars. The model Y with mega casting is cheaper to build than the model 3 but sells for more. Once mega casting and structural batteries are used on all models they will be even cheaper to produce and they will lower prices further. See how this works? They will control the EV market and become the best selling car of any kind in less than 2 years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 09:40:56'] Huge miss. Especially considering the multiple price cuts happened on top to bring in new customers. And people were expected more of 450k deliveries for the share climbs. Instead it missed even Wall Street's delivery numbers.Stock was flying the entire week last week expecting huge beats.Great company but there's probably going to be some correction to share price from last week's huge climbs.But then markets make no sense.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 05:46:11'] So after reading beyond the headline revenue beat it seems that their 16% operating margin, and 24.3% automotive margins excluding EV credits, are the lowest it's been in the last 5 quarters. If we were referenceing any other company, commodity, or product, e.g., CPI it would probably be considered decelerating growth. tldr; TSLA beats on revenue, growth is decelerating, (short term rally long term pain)

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 09:01:10'] Laughable market response on the idea that Tesla was somehow oversold. (It's up 50% merely on that). The earnings report was not good. They beat the markets estimates, but everything was down. Earnings growth rate was down, revenue growth rate was down, margins were the lowest in 5 quarters. And the guidance was point blank that "margins would continue to decline" Outlook. Spending will continue to cool in the US thruout 2023 with cutbacks to big ticket items. While the labor market remains strong, the YOLO spending of 2021, 2022 will end in 2023 as consumers excess savings run out, and they will start to constrain their debt spending. US is Teslas best market. Interest rates will stay high for longer or Fed crashes economy. Either way:Tesla will not grow deliveries anywhere near 50% in 2023. The EPS growth rate will not justify a current 35 PE and forward 35 PE. ($500 billion market cap). Stock settles out at $50 in 2024-2025.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 12:59:37'] It seems silly to not consider production capacity. They're currently able to produce twice as many cars per year as they did last year. It stands to reason that as capacity increases, backlogs will decrease. This is not bad for business. If they start to have more capacity than demand, then we've got a problem.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 13:21:03'] And December will be even lower‚Ä¶. You know why?Federal EV tax credits will once again apply to the Model 3 and Model Y strtingrg January 1st 2023‚Ä¶ most people aren‚Äôt going to order a Tesla when they can just wait two months and get a $7,500 tax credit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 12:54:37'] I‚Äôm as much a bear on tesla than anyone. Hell I made money this week riding puts on it. But a decreased backlog increases speed customers get cars and customer satisfaction. People will continue to order the cars. I see the stock going to 80 personally but the backlog is why I haven‚Äôt personally gotten a Tesla yet. If I wanted to wait to get a car I‚Äôd just not get the car. This is America: home of the I want it and I want it now
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 13:39:08'] ‚ÄúLet that sink in‚ÄùI hate Elon, but that could be just orders being filled due to ramped up production. This sub is so fucking stupid these days.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 18:19:23'] Tesla's order backlog may have dropped a bit, but that's not always a bad thing. It could just mean that they've made more and are better able to meet the demand. And if they need to come up with some new ways to market and sell their products, I'm sure they'll do so as they always do. They are called the "pioneers" of electric cars for a reason.I try to be more optimistic finger-crossed
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 12:58:45'] It‚Äôs probably a combination of ‚Ä¢ the gigafactory in china producing at capacity ‚Ä¢ china being in economic crisis ‚Ä¢ china being more protectionist and less cooperative than priorI mean the drop is basically mostly the red part of the bar melting over the Corona years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 12:47:57'] Bringing a couple of giga factories online should do that.   Kinda the whole point some might say.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 13:54:25'] That's a good thing. They are catching up. ALSO, keep in mind, many people aren't buying waiting for Jan 1, 2023 to see what tax EV credit they can get, $7,500 or whatever. game changer.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 14:47:17'] Imagine that, over a year of double-digit inflation particularly on fuel, services, and food, have caused a reduction in orders for a mid range luxury vehicle. Who'd have guessed it?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 13:03:40'] Two real reasons here:  1. We are in a recession, and expensive BEV's arent the first thing consumers tend to buy when facing or in a recession.2. Everyone that is going to order is waiting on the new EV tax breaks to get finalized.  Folks are sort of hedging their bets on that $7000 credit, and people aren't ordering until there is final news on it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 06:46:21'] Having lived through the 1970s, I can say from experience that high interest rates crush car sales just as much as home sales.  Almost all people finance cars.  High interest rates double the monthly car payments.  Never good for auto companies no matter ICE or EV

If you look at their [quarterly production numbers](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zno6j3/teslas_order_backlog_drops_to_its_lowest_less/) you'll see that they are making more and more cars. They are getting to the point where prod can keep up with demand. Micropenis boy is actually showing a good thing here, not the snarky insult that was implied.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 12:30:13'] Who tf is buying cars at 8% interest..?!?The whole market is about to tank, the only was interests hikes work. Intentional submarining of the entire economy, to reduce inflation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 16:36:40'] Considering tesla produces roughly 100,000 cars per month and the decrease is about 100,000 cars per month, it tells me they are actually catching up on back orders. Good work tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 22:34:43'] EV‚Äôs are gonna get cheaper and more competitively priced. Prices drop, marketable audience increases, more potential sales. I don‚Äôt see price drops as weakness, I think tesla has done a great job absorbing the capacity to make people pay above $65k for them for so long, because they were the apex. I‚Äôll pay $30k for one, until that models arrived, I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sure other people would feel the same. Basically, I have no fucking idea what I‚Äôm talking about and nor does anyone.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 00:24:39'] This is a far too big of a drop. Demand is likely weak. I am surprised they want to keep increasing supply. I am sure though that Elon wants to kill competitors. At those prices other companies will likely lose a lot of money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 05:33:29'] Headlines for Tesla seem to be the only thing the market cares about. Not the fact he is just MANAGING the business. First, no one talks about how much he increased prices over last 24 months, upwards of 20%, and now this price point of the Y will NOW qualify for tax credit. This is power play for growth. So what margins take 5% hit while sales increase by another 50% in '23. I hate the media. Oh yeah, go ahead and load up on puts, Ill be waiting on the other side, u/sushishishi

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 23:39:22'] Anyone who says a 13k price drop is bullish needs to take a cold shower. If you have a product that is apparently so good and so high in demand you don't drop your price that drastically coming into a recession. Tesla is in trouble and this is your reality cheque.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 01:46:40'] 1. Price cuts to satisfy the tax incentives 2. Means for the cheaper Y, they‚Äôll get an additional 7500 off3. Econ 101, all the cheaper EVs have Tesla competition 4. They raised prices last year because of a broken supply chain globally, this brings it back, especially after the interest rate hike. It‚Äôs Econ 101

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 23:12:33'] They went from naming their price to out competing at the flip of a switch. Tesla has been running the race alone until very recently. This isn't desperation, this is them actually starting to compete on a price basis.&#x200B;Bullish as fuck because tesla still has a manufacturing advantage and can drop lower than companies still building their EV factories. The status quo of tesla selling every car before its made will persist and every other company will have to drop profits to compete.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 03:43:36'] This price drop is going to shoot up their sales volume and take sales away from other manufacturers.  What is funny is that their margins are still more than Toyota and Ford after these cuts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 22:39:37'] Well if they undercut their competitors while still maintaining some level of profitability but putting their competitors into losses at the same time, they can swallow up more of the overall ev market and sell more cars.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 23:33:22'] Bro 13k drop? That‚Äôs near 100% of their net margin.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 22:57:04'] This means they are more affordable, and will sell tons more. And still make a profit
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 04:36:12'] Short term stock price hit. Every $5000 dollars in price reduction open up the possible buyers of your product by 3 to 4 times. So with a price drop and incentives from the IRA you will see orders go thru the roof. Tesla had raised prices because of supply chain pressures that no longer are in play. These cars will also have 4680 batteries with a cheaper production cost. A stock price dump is a good buying opportunity for a company like Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 22:50:29'] Tesla is about to get fucking whalloped by competition that can manufacture better stuff, can deliver it cheaper, makes cars that aren't horrendously ugly or weirdly compromised in the interior, and aren't run by CEOs who are aggressively trying to alienate their target customers with an insane political ideology.It's gonna be great fun to watch.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 01:30:09'] Interesting, drop, we have seen Tesla ramp and ramp prices as raw materials increased. Now this is the pivot. Probably better one big drop than countless smaller ones as buyers would otherwise wait to buy. I can only assume that it is far cheaper to make a Y in Texas than a Y in a tent in California. Read Giga press, lower staff costs, newer factory. But moreover for the competitors wow, this is painful. Tesla with $20b in the bank could sell cars for 0 profit and still run for a few years. Other OEMs with their debts not so long. I suspect Model Y will be the best selling car in the USA this year.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 04:57:38'] But at least Elon is saving free speech or whatever
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 05:29:06'] Elon said two years ago the price increases were temporary until commodity prices come down. Sure, demand may be part of it, but it‚Äôs not the only reason.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 18:30:00'] And of course it's just a software updateCall it a "software recall" or "OTA critical safety update." To say they're "recalling vehicles" just sounds misleading to the general populace because historically that implies bringing the car back to the dealership or getting replacement parts. Asking someone to press a prominent "update" button in their car or letting it update overnight or something isn't the same tier of issue nor expense to the company

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 15:40:09'] after the overdone sell-off late last year, the best thing one can hope for is that Tesla rallies & then sits in a trading range between its 200 day moving average at 225-ish and its old support/resistance level of 180. Consolidating within that large range for six months or more is a gold mine. Wouls allow for MACD + RSI to cool off and would form solid retracement/base for next leg up. Get along the stock. Because its an INVESTMENT. THen TRADE options. Sell out of the money calls when the stock is close to 180. Sell dead at the money calls when stock is close to 230. Rinse repeat. Get Paid.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 15:56:15'] Aren't these recalls always software updates, you don't have to actually take the car to get repaired? After a while these recall numbers are going to be a small percentage of total Teslas. Now if it was their interiors and quality control, that would be a concern.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 06:56:57'] Coming from an european truckdriver, I have to say I dont see the appeal for the EU market. The tesla truck is longer than a conventional scania semi, which equals to less cargo as EU and scandinavia has strict lenght laws. The truck itself weights roughly 13 metric tonnes*, which is 4 tonnes more than a conventional scania, which again equals to less cargo capasity. The range I dont see an issue with however as 800 km is quite good.* tesla does not, on any print, define the dry weight of the semi, which is alarming since its the metric that is most important for a european company to know, HOW MUCH CARGO? NOT MAX WEIGHT. One can only make an educated guess by deducting the weight of the cargo present in the video, which puts the tesla at about 13 metric tonnes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 05:29:27'] Great, a truck that can carry it's own batteries 500 miles. Now actually load it with a typical truck load and see how far it can go. Now divide by the cost of the truck and let me know how it compares to a traditional truck. Until then, this is nonsense.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 05:10:40'] Tesla is ALL about FSD, its forward PE only justifies a 100-150 price(depending on how low they actually take margins and for how long).  The cyber truck and lower prices 'model 2' car being made in Mexico will get them to 20m cars/year and a PE \~10-25.   If they get FSD working(robotaxi level working) then the company is highly undervalued as it'll be worth more than the car company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 20:05:50'] Some advice to maybe help you in future with DD. 1. If you‚Äôre going to say Tesla is a cash burning machine, it‚Äôs a good (I‚Äôd say mandatory) idea to include the Statements of Cashflows (SOCF). Most companies have negative investing and financing activities, but negative operating activities is generally a bad sign. 2. Looking into the operating activities is also smart. What expenses are the driving force behind negative operating cash flows? It will give you questions to ask and things to look for in the other statements. 3. It‚Äôs also a good (again, probably should be mandatory for a DD post) idea to look at the Income Statement (IS). That can show you how revenues are rising or falling, along with cost to produce a product for sale. Now, if gross margin is negative, (others call it gross profit, it‚Äôs mainly before all the other expenses are deducted) that‚Äôs a terrible sign. It means it cost more to produce the product than the company sells it for. Negative operating income is generally not a good sign, but could be due to a lot of different things, and is something you should investigate. 4. It‚Äôs also a good idea to glance at a Balance sheet (BS) and see if you can spot trends that may be worth investigating further. For example, if accounts receivables (AR) is piling up, maybe their having problems getting payment from customers. If payables are increasing, are they having liquidity problems and not able to pay vendors? Is inventory piling up and not selling? What do equity look like? These are all basic DD you can do by simply looking at the financial statements, either Tesla‚Äôs year end or most recent quarterly. From there, you can get more things to investigate, look at, and pursue to see if your theory of Tesla being a cash burning machine, is accurate. Or you can just do crayon-drawing level DD and post it to WSB. Half the sub might think it‚Äôs a meme and give you an upvote anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 09:53:40'] its Y-O-Y.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 01:32:33'] I always find it interesting these analyses that demand you look at the data the way the author decided to look at it and insists that everything else does not matter. It seems more the product of an inability to think than a meaningful product.Myself... I do look at all these numbers and more and also think about things holistically as well.From a holistic perspective, on Tesla's investor day they laid out a path to building a global sustainable energy economy and came up with trillions in net savings doing so. Now without getting into whether the numbers add up or not, it has long seemed obvious to me that moving to sustainable energy will be a massive net economic boon. So when I think of Tesla, single quarter results are of little meaning, because I view them as leading by far in an area where the rewards or riches in the coming years are far greater than what we have seen so far. I think that they have a very high chance of succeeding in capitalizing on those riches and we should expect long-run, Tesla's financial results to be very strong.And from a financial perspective... They are increasing production and selling the cars. This rapid growth will at times not align with short-term changes in supply and demand. Further, they have a path to cutting costs substantially over time, but the timing of those cost reductions may also not align with fluctuations in supply and demand. The natural result is we should absolutely expect to see weaker quarters profit-wise as they grow. So long as they are profitable and the outlook remains cash-flow positive the short-term fluctuations should not matter that much.As to regulatory credits... From a theoretical standpoint I think they are irrelevant. I just view them as additional revenue and when they phase out, it will mean that production of ICEV's has declined sufficiently that the competitive landscape does not require them anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 13:07:42'] Doesn‚Äôt someone have to buy the contract for him to make that money? If he exercises it he has to buy 44*100= $4,400 shares of Tesla which I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt have enough money to do so.So my question is, is there someone willing to buy his contracts from him at $50 a piece for him to make the $200,000? Cause if not then he hasn‚Äôt made anything.

I had similar gains on Tesla $150 calls, and want to be a long term investor in addition to degenerate gambler. So I sold some calls and left some that I can exercise (and buy shares at $150 bargain prices) using the cash I gained from the sale, and I‚Äôve still got leftovers for more degenerate plays.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 09:30:16'] Every other week we hear about these car makers ‚Äòsurpassing‚Äô Tesla in autonomy, but when you look deeper these automakers are NOT solving for a generalized solution. Meaning they have severe limitations like ‚Äòonly works while driving in a straight line‚Äô ‚Äòonly works on highways‚Äô Yeah no. Look at a Tesla driving through San Fransisco‚Äôs rush hour, down Lombard street and into a city school zone stopping for children and you instantly see the difference. Tesla is decades ahead and like Elon said: ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt see second place with a telescope‚Äô
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 10:40:28'] I used to work at Benz and I can confirm that they‚Äôve been saying they have better tech than Tesla since 2015.A tech lead told me that Tesla uses their customers as guinea-pigs and that goes against Benz safety policy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 03:25:43'] Mercedez-Benz is using radar, LiDAR and ultrasound, Tesla is using none of that and just cameras. Which is why Tesla is losing the self-driving race against everyone, even Uber (who pulled out).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 05:33:20'] 2021 Mercedes self driving features suck. They frequently think a car is somewhere when it's not. Sunlight/Shadows seem to make the car freak out. Maybe they have improved, but I would trust Tesla's self driving features and ALL other non automotive technology over Mercedes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 04:36:34'] Problem is you cant buy one , 12 to 18 month wait. Of course you can find one from someone flipping it for 20% over MSRP or more .Dealers have something they call "market adjustment ". So if a dealer has an order that a customer ordered and the customer backs out ,they flip it for outrageous money. Perfect example My next door neighbor orders a Ford lightning waits 16 months .Shows up to pick it up MSRP is 77k Dealer says you want to sell? Offers him on the spot 105k ,he takes it dealer sells it to a willing customer that afternoon for 118k . Dont listen to the bullshit , VW all the Korean Manufacturers, GM , MB, Audi none of them have cars. So in the here and now today TSLA has inventory . That's why it is skyrocketing ,people that actually analyze the auto biz and advise wall street know this ! You degenerates who google something and become 15 second experts don't know this.  72% of new car buyers buy a car because they need it . So if you need a car and want an EV in the United states anyway TSLA is essentially the only one who can give it to you now currently. FACT
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 00:41:08'] Mercedes actually makes profits and doesn't have to rely on govt subsidies or Bitcoin to prop up its balance sheet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 05:57:40'] Lidar and radar only get you so far, to solve the problem properly your model needs to predict what other people on the road are going to do, and that needs ridiculous amounts of data and training. I just don't think Mercedes has the scale.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 08:40:04'] Look at the videos on youtube of Tesla beta testers using the FSD (full self driving) . There's no way any of the competitors are doing this level of self driving with lidar. Tesla is light years ahead with cameras and it's internal neural network. Level 3 automation is marketing speaking at this point ( yes I know it's technically not - but under 40? yeah weak sauce)

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 10:52:18'] Tesla has 100k cars on the road with FSD. Mercedes and nvidia have not surpassed Tesla. Tesla‚Äôs lead actually seems to be growing
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 12:20:02'] There is little point in comparing this to Tesla as Tesla is (they think they are) on a path to achieving level 4 which is kind of the Holy Grail of self-driving as that would allow for most travel just requiring a destination input to get your where you are going. You can achieve level 3 or level 4 within strict geographic limitations faster but they don't necessarily offer the development path for what Tesla is trying to achieve.So as much as this announcement is great and welcome news for anyone hoping to see improvements in current assisted driving software this has little relevance to what Tesla is working on, which if works out is a complete game-changer.Not looking to debate whether Tesla will or will not achieve their self-driving goals, but rather pointing out that there is little point in the comparison between them.

The Tesla propaganda seems to indicate on average Tesla's account for less than 1/2 of an incident involving a Tesla per day. This seems to indicate that Tesla's are much safer than other vehicles on the road.In 2022 Tesla produced 1.3  million vehicles. Of those 182 are listed in the Tesla propaganda, or 0.014%. Again this would indicate Tesla's are much safer than other vehicles on the road.The only thing more despicable than a Tesla fan boy, is false Tesla propaganda.Surely you can divine a much more productive use of your time than gathering useless data. Or if you have your heart set on doing useless things at least include other brands in your research so there is better context.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-14 14:53:57'] I can understandd why OP thinks this is significant and while there are many more ICE vehicle fires I would imagine if you broke the stats down you would find much older cars, many with poor or zero maintenance history, possibly driven by some of the dumbest people on the planet. Now here is Tesla, with a very new body of work, that are driven by educated people with the money to keep them maintained (even though they don't have a dealership to get it fixed at).I think this number is significant as these cars are too new and well engineered  to be bursting into flames. I've been witness to a lithium battery fire on an electric scooter. It was violent and terrifying, IT was like a bomb going off as the cells exploded and shot white hot flames and shrapnel everywhere. Plus the smoke is incredibly acrid and toxic. I think many people don't realize the sheer chemical danger that EV's use to move. Those batteries better be damm near perfect and have some sort of fire supression built in.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:58:19'] The thing with Tesla is that they have millions of people  on the road testing their self driving software... the data they've been able to gather is insurmountable by any small start up. For anyone to catch up to Tesla they would have had to drop the ball and self sabotage themselves.... I mean they convinced a bunch of people to pay them thousands of dollars to test unfinished software.... so not only do they have all these testers and all this data, but they are getting paid for it as well. It's quite the racket.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 07:09:31'] I'm often obsessed with AI and 'driving bots' with different systems all vying for attention, when, I think the future could be as simple as this:Fit all street lights with transceivers that can talk to cars and allow information to flow between these systems and ALL cars on the road.A sort of "Automotive MIDI" that, regardless of the manufacturer, the car will be in permanent communication with an EWS, and, to make sure the car understands where it is in position to everything else.This would do the brunt on the work, with the cars themselves doing the final leg work in terms of speed, position, spatial acuity etc.This would LESSEN the requirements of the AI on board the car, and, provide better generalised information.&#x200B;In other words, the insistence by car manufacturers to have an 'all-singing-and-dancing' solution is the result of their NOT being sufficient information on the road for the cars to use.&#x200B;Human beings need TRAFFIC LIGHTS to know when it is 'safe'.What does AI need to know; and can it be provided in the streets through simply attaching a device to each and every street lamp?It would not impact pedestrians, it would not need a new 'pole' to be dug.Just a 'magic box', probably the size of a smartphone (and using similar tech!) to be attached to the street lights.Street lights are also at a consistent distance, too.&#x200B;Just a thought, someone surely would have a system in place in a theoretical government proposal somewhere?&#x200B;The tech exists to do it, but I doubt car manufacturers would support something in such a competitive industry...yet, we do have SATNAV systems, so, my hopes are high.&#x200B;Just a short opinion whilst I read your post.‚ô•

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 07:02:43'] How exactly does electricity cost in batteries work?The battery is 1 MWH, and the average cost of a kilowatt/hr in the US is 0.167 as of September 2022. So does it cost 167 dollars on average to fill a MWH pack? Does 1 kilowatt hour directly out of the power source refill exactly 1 KWH of power in a battery? Is there any lost in transmission when recharging the battery?I am curious exactly how much it costs to recharge the pack. To go 500 miles at 6 MPG at the national average for diesel would cost around 436 bucks right now
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 08:28:47'] If this is legit and the batteries aren't too much of that weight, its amazing.I'll stay skeptical until there is proof tho.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 05:28:37'] Impressive but 500 miles is a short hauler and it‚Äôs more like 400 miles if you don‚Äôt want to replace the battery often.Your average semi truck has two 125 gallon saddle tanks with a mpg rating of 7-9 mpg loaded. That‚Äôs 1750-2250 miles. It‚Äôs  efficient and a milestone but no one will be trading in those diesels any time soon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 07:09:55'] This would be great for LTL operators. None of their trucks do 500 a day. 100-400 is the ballpark. Think Old Dominion, Fed Ex, Estes, R&L and Duie Pyle. Probably a better market there than OTR. They all go back and sit for the night. Then they put solar on the roof and become high profit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 04:51:17'] This is important bc a large part of hauls are <250 miles, making them possible only with charging at home base. Elevation is also not a big issue since it will be inverse on the way back, and the truck has powerful regen.There are even situations where goods are hauled down a hill with the cargo always being empty on the way back, making it possible to run these hauls *without ever needing to charge*, since the extra weight on the way down adds so much regen power. (Not to be confused by another brand of truck that only runs downhill period).

Traffic is inefficient, stoping to charge or fuel up is inefficient, 5 seater  vehicles and single trailers are inefficient, electric cars and trucks solve this ? No they only arguably solve the emissions issue with vehicles.  They are not the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù they are a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. The future is almost certainly Rail. Cargo rail, passenger rail, luxury rail. Whatever fuel is used isn‚Äôt important cause it‚Äôs going to change to whatever is the most efficient.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 10:31:06'] In the early years of Tesla, what I thought many others didn't appreciate about Tesla was the fact that they had extraordinary talent: those noteworthy in their fields to have their own Wikipedia article. That's required to fight entropy: the many ways in which you can fail vs the few ways you succeed in building an all new car company that makes BEVs viable.I think the legends that left Tesla include Jim Keller (processor architecture, hardware for autopilot), JB Straubel(battery design, CTO for 15 years and the soul of the company to me), and now Karpathy (AI computer vision, self driving).They were all not just good, but revolutionary in their fields. Tesla still has a contract Jeff Dahn (NMC cell co-inventor), and a great team overall with solid foundations. However it seems like a different company: less extraordinary, now. This may have no correlation with profitability, but I think it does impact the magnitude of innovative steps they make.More recently still, well Musk self imploded and all the safety controls to stop him have left the company.

There's no meta-energy-integration one stop shop, as evidenced by them cancelling many of their solar roof projects. The autopilot is like you having to supervise an over-cautious teenager. Full autonomous driving is years and years away (if ever). The technology is ahead of other EV's, but everyone else is catching up. It's nice to spout off pipe dreams and grand designs, but in the end, the valuation should be closer to a Ford or GM rather than Apple or Microsoft.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 13:33:49'] best part is we're not near the bottom.  I think i fair price target for Tesla is around $20 a share.  They played a ton of accounting tricks on their earnings reports too for the past couple of years--with growth slowing and profitability dropping--i don' think they'll have the same latitude for "creative" accounting--look out below.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 11:12:46'] Bought the dip and got a couple of shares today for an average price of 105‚Ç¨. It‚Äôs a small position but the stock found a bottom at 100‚Ç¨ before, and the extremely bearish sentiment on WSB is a great counter indicator. Should it go lower, I might increase my position to 1% of my portfolio

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 11:30:24'] What people often don't realize.... Tesla's meteoric rise in 2020... Was in many ways a short squeeze. Elon sold the dream, Tesla started to hit mainstream, and Tesla was heavily shorted. Fed when Brrrr.... Newly enriched retail clamors to Tesla.... Squeeze people like Burry... who fundamentally knew it was overvalued.So in reality this is just the delayed correction as retail is starting to lose their resolve under the pressure of a bear market. Retail just doesn't have the funds to DCA and keep the stock up. Tesla also doesn't have the institutional ownership like Apple to stabilize it's decline.All good, Tesla still has the best engineering in the industry and it will prevail in the long run. Elon does need to get out of its way now. He was great for the pump...but it has now proven to be a double edged sword.He really just need to focus on SpaceX and let someone else take the reins at Tesla.

It's down over delivery issues (no shocker there, shipping is still a huge issue) What I'm feeling is that is a tiny dumb reason for this stock to be considered a bad buy. I'm sure they now have a focus on fixing the shipping and delivery issues. Buy quite low now because of all of this, hold it for a few quarters as they start getting their ducks in a row.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 07:39:05'] Musk has lost it, and won't get better anytime soon, possible never will.  Without him being able to uphold his spell on devoted adoring cultists, Tesla stock price will fall close to it's real, non-bubble value, somewhere between 10$ and 30$, depending on how they perform.   I sold all my Teslas a while ago, the only reason I'm not shorting is that there's still enough dumb Elon worshipers that it might fluctuate a lot on the way down.   My advice for all Tesla owners is to sell right away and never look back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 22:10:23'] Tesla will be fine. It just rejected its 200 weekly moving average and shot up. Nothing at the core of the company has changed. It still has highly differentiated technology and IP, and a network of companies like SpaceX which help boost its profitability. They're still differentiated in AI and battery technology, and broadly deployed infrastructure, along with consistently putting out innovative new designs.Traditional auto manufacturers just can't do this stuff with the same success. Tesla almost imploded multiple times. If these technologies like self-driving trucks take off, there's just nobody with all of the key pieces and manufacturing capabilities like Tesla. Like it or not, even the Twitter feud could breed new tech, like global Starlink phones and the like, which would also be game-changing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 20:13:32'] Apple just deleted all their tweets and twitter lost their #1 advertiser. Shit is going down fast for Elon Musk

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 03:57:35'] Unpopular opinion perhaps. Apple thinks they can do whatever they want, often not giving any further explanations. Tesla and SpaceX have more fundamental value than Apple in my opinion. They serve more the future of humanity. Free speech being also one of them. Funny meme anyways üòÇ

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 07:16:07'] When you say normal‚Ä¶ do you mean fall in line with the Liberal way of thinking?  Before Elon bought Twitter and said he was voting ‚ÄúRed‚Äù he could do no wrong. So it‚Äôs either liberal/media hysteria having the stock go down, perhaps going down to the price it should be, or perhaps both. With whatever side you stand on. Please actually take the time to read articles from both sides to see what is actually going on. The powers that be are getting what they want be further dividing everyone. Why would they want to do that, so they can have more power to rule over us. Let‚Äôs keep our free will and don‚Äôt let Washington overtake our way of life

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 07:36:28'] Unpopular opinion here...Love the meme. But I think you're all wrong. Not that I'm a history buff, but weren't many of the most successful and revolutionary persons throughout history this sort of thing? With huge momentum against them and all the popular view against them? Someone with that education list them please.I think in a year or two the tides will turn back in his favor and a lot of you will also suddenly change your tunes - kind of like those who are "fans" of the current sports team champ. Think for yourselves.But you say...but but but his ideas are so stoopid! It's so obvious!! ...Are you a proven genius with several "wins" (not a one-off like Zuck or Gates) and have you made billions? No. So is he stupid or are you the one who is stupid? Do a bit of introspection.Seriously he will "win" with a combo of his own phone + Starlink. That is such an obvious win. Going against Apple now is awesome since he'll have all you plebes drive him into making his own phone (while it was his idea from the start) with a "loss" against Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 22:53:06'] This is the problem. Elon Musk is on the spectrum, he has no understanding of social things, but he thinks he does, and he has bought a major social network. As he leaves Tesla to go run Twitter, both stocks will fall like rocks. Not much to be done about it, short of somehow convincing Elon that he really isn‚Äôt cut out for social networking.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 01:48:42'] I've been holding Tesla since 2013. Every time Elon does something that gets the keyboard warriors going people pretend it's the end of the world. It's not. Tesla will grow production ~50% this year, then again next year, and would you believe it again the year after that.Shares are finally starting to look cheap due to the macro downtrend. I'm going to start buying more in the next couple of months.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 01:51:29'] You know that there is a 130% chance that Elon made this meme and released it.... Right?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 01:55:35'] Without Musk's cult of personality Tesla stocks would never have reached this high anyway. Now investors are seeing the downside (and Tesla is still nowhere near where it really should be anyway, lol)

I was in the car biz for over 30 years and in todays USA, it‚Äôs pretty damn common. How do you think ANY car dealer is able to spend millions on a facility, millions on their personal home(s)?

The smartest man alive and they all sought to drive a Tesla.  It was going to help the environment and finally bring down big oil by changing the industry forever.  Then Elon says he supports free speech and is against censorship on social media.  Democrats now think Elon is the devil and all of a sudden post videos about how Tesla cars suck.  Democrats in America, the phoniest bunch of radicalized mentals on this planet.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 01:55:01'] Because Tesla should trade at the same multiples as Volkswagen & Toyota. It‚Äôs margins will decline sharply as its cars are inferior to and more expensive than its competitors. Same as Amazon PE multiple declining to around 26 - same as Google & Microsoft. It‚Äôs just a cloud business where margins are shrinking
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 17:11:55'] Elon pissed off China in his normal will-risk-everything-for-the-"likes" way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 18:26:57'] Algorithms noticed the volume and money inflows decreasing. The PFOF provides excellent metrics to document weakness in all stocks.  Like a girl at the dance (that's ugly and nobody wants to ask her for a spin) the stock gets dumped. Tesla's value is not selling  cars. Or trucks. Or battery storage, or data, or future possibilities. It's the liquidity of it's stock.  The "value" of Telsa is the ability for institutional investors to trade the stock.You (and your capital) are the real products. You provide liquidity for the trading of Tesla which benefits and provides a market for the whales. It's just a small club. And "you ain't in it".

Yeah, if I can turn water to gold it will change my life, too.  The dude now recognizes that it's basically like solving AGI. But it's still selling everyone the hope. They should just stick to the basics: make good cars, good factories, scale it up, make it cheap and stop trying to "drive" the car out of the parking lot.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 21:33:46'] We must have watched different investor presentations.  95%+ of that was old material and the other 5% was pretty vague.  The Optimus demo was another CGI which they tried to play off as a real robot.  On that note, can't figure out how Elon gets away with shit like that while Milton went to prison for pushing their truck down a hill.Additionally, they continued to act like build quality and piss poor service/support are not issues.  They even payted themselves on the back about how well oiled everything is.  Almost anyone who has utilized service will tell you a much different story.I was hoping it would have pumped though as I wanted to buy more PUTs.On that note, Q1 will be weak.  Even w/ incentives they are struggling, especially in China and Europe.  I expect Q2 will be a huge disappointment, though due to IRA rebates dropping in U.S. after March.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 06:20:21'] The problem with Tesla is Elon Musk. Quite frankly the guy has become obnoxious, racist, and vile. I am not one of those who think all that üëÜüèø means he's always been a scam. I think he's legitimately smart but the dead weight is killing Tesla.People don't buy with their heads, they buy with their hearts and my heart is not into Tesla at least Elon anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 07:40:21'] if microsoft is at 250 and people think microsoft is going to 300 tomorrow, its going to 300 today. when the news comes out, one of two things happens. if the news is in line with expectations, microsoft remains around 300 because that new info has already been priced in. if the news is not in line with expectations, microsoft pumps or dumps based on whether the news was better or worse than expected. stocks move on expectations and corrections of expectations. the news in a way has an indirect effect because its not the news changing the price, its the news leading people to alter their expectations which then leads to buying and selling. econ 101 my friend.

It was more of the same without more details for the next 90 days, which is what analysts care about because they are often bonused on stock moves.Disclosure: I went short TSLA yesterday with some puts.  Not bc I don't believe in the vision, but because of the daily chart.Btw, I bet his next investor day will be much better.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 14:43:00'] People have short attention spans. Also option market controls the stock price these days. Think about what they said though. 50% reduction in production costs. They have a blue ocean strategically for 12-15 years. Smartest thing they can do is cede market share. Other companies lose money on each car. It isn‚Äôt sustainable but gets people into EVs. They build out the charging infrastructure at 50-70% cheaper than anyone globally. Their cars are 20-30% more efficient. It‚Äôs nuts. Cathie wood‚Äôs 650% 5-year growth target for TSLA is way low from what I saw. I‚Äôm betting the two cars will be a last-mile delivery can and some kind of small cheap car in the 25-35k range.

But look at how lithium batteries got smaller and more energy dense. Sodium batteries are as dense as lithium batteries 20 years ago. So given time a work they could get as good as lithium batteries. So there is a place for them now and there will be a place for them in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 12:52:54'] Someone on Twitter said that his behaviour made it look like he was jonesing to get back to it the whole time, and that‚Äôs a pretty good summary I feel. He was even late turning up to it, replying to tweets instead.I don‚Äôt know how I feel about TSLA. It feels like a lot of the promises and potential are already baked into the price, but at the same time if they actually delivered on these things I could imagine it going up even higher. The description of it as a cultish stock is pretty much spot on.Also there‚Äôs going to come a point in the not too distant future where he has to make more payments to keep Twitter afloat, and that can only come from one place (despite his promises to the contrary, which can‚Äôt be relied upon anyway). Nothing he has done for Twitter suggests any kind of coherent plan to achieve what they‚Äôd never managed to do previously, and that impacts TSLA both materially in stock sales, but also because it is exposing Musk as being less Tony Stark and more Justin Hammer with each flub he makes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:24:34'] We all gotta respect what Tesla has done over the last decade. Anyone ***not*** respecting that is truly a dumbass.However, for this graphic to have any real relevance to the market, one would need to see growth trajectories and market share statistics. beyond a single moment in time. And even that would have to be taken with a large grain of salt. Example: thebchart states WV only produced 46,000 EVs / PHEVs in 2021, but another source blows that number out of the water in 2022:>The Volkswagen Group handed over **366,400** fully electric vehicles to customers in the first nine months of this year, around 25 per cent more than in the same period last year (**293,000**).Why does this source have such dramatically different figures?But anyway, regardless of actual data, the market did what it usually does, which is overreact beyond any reasonable valuation, and as such, it will likely overreact on the way down, just the same.Bearish momentum still in full control here. It will take some time to see if Tesla can eke out a decent moat, or if they‚Äôll just be your typical auto manufacturer facing margin compression as competition heats up.I have no emotional attachment really. Just want to share my opinion based on logic and logic alone.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:54:20'] This graph is so accurate it doesn't even consider Rivians because they are trucks not vehicles..... /s
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:54:12'] Tesla is already offering huge discounts for people to buy this year.  Demand for their cars has slowed due to the rise in interest rates and a slowing economy.  Musk has probably damaged the brand name permanently with his incessant insults to environmentally conscious ‚Äúwoke‚Äù potential purchasers on Twitter.  A recent survey showed Tesla for the first time as a company was in the negative favorability territory.  TSLA is down from $402 to around $123/ share latest close.  At $123/share TSLA has a PE ratio of 38.05. Most major vehicle PE ratios are between 6 and 11.  If anything, I see TSLA sales to be stagnant at best while its‚Äô shares continue to fall and Ford, GM, VOLVO, BMW and Toyota catch up.  I don‚Äôt know how much TSLA stock Musk has pledged on margin so he could make his vanity purchase of Twitter, but as TSLA continues to fall, he may have to sell more of the stock to meet margin calls, thus driving down the stock further.  THE Tesla brand is wounded, and I see people looking for other opportunities before buying into the company or wanting one of their cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:09:32'] The question is do the others want to catch up? There is still massive demand for non-EV vehicles for many reasons...

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:15:25'] What about BYD from China? Easy to be the first if you do not include the whole world? Remembers me of Super Bowl champs calling themself world championüò¨
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:02:45'] The real competitor of Tesla is VW. Don't be fooled by the US market, this is a global challenge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:45:07'] Tesla needs to inject some more car models into their market. But I think other car makers are going to need a long time before they get close to Tesla. Ford had to increase the pricing of their electric cars, and their flagship the lightning has been having issues with battery life and performance.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:07:34'] These are companies whose businesses are all about swapping out their plants for new models every few years.  They are deliberately limiting production of their EVs (lots of reasons) or else I'd think they could mass produce them very quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:23:18'] Company that only makes EVs makes the most EVs by volume compared to companies that don't only make EVs.Fucking brilliant.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:43:34'] You got anymore of that copium to snort?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:43:52'] Nobody it seems is taking into account that the major automotive companies in the US aren‚Äôt even using much of their manufacturing capabilities for EV‚Äôs yet. Tesla can‚Äôt supply all their orders like established brands. Once the big fish finally make the full switch they‚Äôre gonna squash Tesla like a bug
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:50:42'] How long until Tesla catches up in quality?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:55:16'] Never heard of BYD?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:57:34'] How heavy are your bags right now OP?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:05:15'] Personal preference but I‚Äôll take a hybrid any day. The utility of it is fantastic. My wife has a Toyota Venza and it‚Äôs AWD , gets over 40mpg and I never have to search for a plug in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:07:32'] Ooh ooh now do all of their p/e ratios
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:09:19'] It‚Äôs complete bullshit, hydrogen will be here in 2/3 years time, going to petrol stations and filling ICEs as normal.I am in the HGV industry and nobody but nobody is buying electric trucks, just waiting for the next gen hydrogen.Electric is a con and Tesla is on the way out, it‚Äôs not future proofed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:10:10'] You can literally look up production plans for every major brand. 25/26 is when there's going to be enormous growth in production for all major brands. Customers will have a range of options pretty equivalent to ICE cars, and they'll all be fighting for market share. If Tesla survives that competition well enough to still be a massive brand then its market cap is still vastly overvalued. Tesla offers nothing unique. Those car manufacturers can do everything it does, and with decades more experience in manufacturing cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:15:52'] I really want Tesla to keep doing well. I want the QC issues to get fixed but I really really like Tesla. Am I a mad man for wanting the cyber truck?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:44:49'] I don‚Äôt see Nio or BYD. VW to overtake Tesla by 2024? This comment is surprisingly small. üòÖ
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:54:50'] I'm just wondering how many EVs besides Tesla are known for their ability to trap their passengers inside them, catch on fire, and automatically hit pedestrians
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 18:45:14'] Even if this chart wasnt BS i would still predict in 2 years time tesla will be the faux luxury ev brand with ford, hyundai, and toyota overwhelming the ev market
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:36:05'] More and more videos showing the shit craftsmanship of their overpriced vehicles will lead to their downfall unless addressed
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:01:11'] Important to note that whilst tesla's market share in the EV market has declined, their market share in the overall car market has increased significantly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:53:01'] Tesla is trash, who cares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:43:47'] Toyota doesn‚Äôt even want to produce EV right now and they are already at 10%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:58:01'] I find I hard to believe that ev will be as big as people think in the near future without a major upgrade in the infrastructure needed to power these cars we will see a cap at some point on how many people can own them. The average Tesla model does not have the range needed to replace gas and the charging stations are not in place to help them
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:58:17'] People try to act like Tesla won't just keep eventually going up just because it's a hot stock. There was never a reason for it to explode like it did....people just like the stock!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:34:08'] Tesla's specialization means it'll likely continue to dominate, the other companies can't compete simply by only really dabbling by comparison in the EV market
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:08:26'] This graphic is WRONG.  Plug-ins are NOT EVs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:38:01'] The only real competition to Tesla from traditional auto makers could be Toyota.They could literally just remove the ICE engine, increase the battery on plug-in hybrid models, forget about self-driving and call it a day.However, Toyota push of EVs have been very slow, they openly state that they are still not convinced of going full EV yet. (They even are trying with Hydrogen)&#x200B;Disclamer: Both $TSLA and $TM share-hoarder
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:16:26'] This is a learning curve that the industry overall will have to learn quickly so they can start to produce more efficient and affordable electric vehicles over the competition especially Tesla. This doesn‚Äôt excuse Tesla from slacking off, and Elon is too distracted with Twitter. This whole pressure into the EV competition is encouraging, and it‚Äôs good for EV customers. I‚Äôm honestly not ready to transition fully into EVs yet even if my friends and family have (Tesla owners), because this whole space is still relatively young, and a lot could be improved. Not to mention it can and will be bottlenecked by infrastructure if they do not follow the progression of EVs If I‚Äôm being honest, I would like to stay with Audi so we‚Äôll see how much better their e-Trons could get in a decade
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:07:12'] lol volks is the biggest ev seller in the world your graph means shit bruh
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:06:13'] I think Ford will jump on this trend more than any of the other American manufacturers.  Tesla however is light years ahead in technology.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:57:37'] Let's address the elephant in the room, traditional automakers are doing EVs to reduce the average emissions of vehicles sold and because of govt mandates.They are not even intending to compete directly with Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:59:51'] I dont think they will.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:54:07'] There not going to catch up. Tesla would have to stop innovating and that‚Äôs not happening anytime Soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 12:25:46'] As you can see, Tesla is still the dominant player in EV production. However, other brands are quickly catching up and it is estimated that VW could overtake Tesla by 2024. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:35:53'] When Toyota launches its full range of EVs, it‚Äôs a wrap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:37:00'] It will not be long. Most likely 2025. By then the American manufacturers will each be producing a far wider range of EVs and they can outproduce Tesla. The other major factor will be the cost point. GM, Ford, and Chrysler are all planning for less expensive models than Tesla offers. Plus manufacturers will have inventory on the lots.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:37:04'] This is US only. Go global for 2022 and it gets a lot more ugly for tsla

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:44:41'] I am assuming this is only the US‚Ä¶BYD sells a ton of EVs and it is rapidly expanding outside China..Tesla position is not as strong as it used to be. If not, they would not offer 7.5K in the US or 10K discounts in China
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:44:47'] I see a lot of red, but no green. Very bearish

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:50:19'] This is a two year old chart, companies are producing 2023 model year now and this shows 2021.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:53:44'] GM had an almost 100% market share of EVs in 1990s.Tesla had an almost 100% market share of EVs in the 2010s.So the answer: not very long. A decade at most.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:55:12'] Less than 5 years. Everyone is already ramping up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:55:47'] Are you the guy that bought puts on tesla this week?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:56:19'] Considering most legacy automakers only started taking the EV market seriously within the last two years, probably very quickly. Toyota, Ford, VW, Honda, GM are all long time assembly line building and retrofitting experts. This is what they've done for 60 to 100 years. Also, the US would never let Ford or GM ever go bankrupt. Those brands are pure Americana.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:56:52'] I would be curious to see a graph of Tesla's gas powered vehicle production compared to every other manufacture.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:58:21'] Now show us a pie chart for all of the car market and the share of EVs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:02:27'] Chart doesn‚Äôt consider Chinese manufacturers and their numbers are quite larger than Teslas
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:02:52'] They may lose share but the EV pie is growing too

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:05:57'] The future of transportation is not private EV, its public transportation- hopefully Electric powered. The future of electric power is still unclear. At the moment using gas or electricity is basically the same in terms of eco-friendliness. In terms of investing in clean energy- im not sold yet on that idea.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:06:43'] Thought Hyundais and Kia would have been higher
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:07:19'] Holy shit market share can drop when you had 100% and everyone copies you?! Lol NO WAY! Everyone still comparing Ice to Electric just wait till 2030 when they start banning gas cars you will really see the separation and extinction. Ice cars will be like horse and carriage in 50 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:08:09'] By 2025 VW and Merc will be the largest EV producers and Elon will be at Spacex
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:09:36'] Going to change pretty fast.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:10:05'] This chart is misleading as it also includes Plug in Hybrid gas cars (PHEVs). Tesla has a much larger market share of pure EVs than what is shown in the chart.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:12:10'] Never. Ford still dominates gasoline because it was the first. Tesla will follow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:12:53'] This chart is bobbins.  No way Toyota sold that many EVs. They have one model.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:13:16'] 2021 Model Year, so everything produced from like fall of 20 until fall 21.  That's fairly old data considering we are into the 23 MY
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:13:23'] The chart is BS. BYD (not even shown) is the largest EV manufacturer in the world (1.9M vehicles in 2022.)

On the upside, I no longer have to hear about how I need to be investing in Tesla. I recall a similar thing happening a few years ago with him doing he same thing with Apple.

POST_TEXT: b'A very genuine question: if Tesla cut prices every 2 months, why should anyone buy a Tesla? Just postpone and have it cheaper.\nAnd the best part is if anyone followed this logic, prices would then need to chase the ever lowering expectations of customers and keep falling.\nOf course this cannot go on forever as at a minimum you will need to break-even, but this aggressive pricing strategy has the potential to hurt the top line, because of volumes and not because of revenues per car.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 04:24:03'] Good point! I‚Äôm going to wait 7,422 months until they are free.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 06:27:09'] This happened in China when they cut prices, people just stopped buying knowing more price cuts are coming. The weird thing is that other auto dealers are even raising prices. It's a sign that they really need model refreshes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 03:17:28'] I'm not an expert, but I assume they wouldn't be slashing the prices if sales were going so great.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:06:19'] Well I mean, Elon wanted his cars to be affordable in the first place and these models are almost a decade year old. Usually a decrease in pricing means new products on the way. Shit, Apple decreases product prices every year. Bullish
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 05:21:28'] Personally I am bullish on Tesla because the amount of cars that are coming out of Chinese factory üè≠ are completely filling the our cargo ships.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 08:38:22'] Most people here are dumb
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 01:55:59'] >There are a few reasons why someone might still buy a Tesla despite the constant price cuts. Firstly, even though the prices are falling, they are still relatively high compared to other cars on the market. This means that people who can afford it may be more likely to purchase a Tesla as a status symbol. Secondly, Tesla's technology is constantly improving and becoming more affordable, so customers may feel that it is worth buying now in order to get access to the latest and greatest features. Finally, with each price cutTesla becomes more competitive against traditional car manufacturers, which could convince some buyers to switch from their current brand.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 04:17:09'] It still depends. I am actually looking into buying a Gr√ºnheide Model Y cause build quality on others Models is bullshit and Tesla offers the best range for the best price in Germany at the moment. You can allways wait for the sales that's true but then you are also at the constant gable of the car you want not being available. E.g i look for a red Model Y SR its like a needle in a haystack but the discount on the price and the financing is worth it. Then i have enough coworkers buying cars directly and paying the higher price for more customisation. So the "i wait for sales" play is more something for people who either already have a car an can wait it out or don't need one immediately. But most car purchases i have seen people do weren't planned but instead: "I need a new one and it need it now" cause old one was destroyed after a accident or whatnot.But more importantly: the cars that are on sale are overproduction they are being produced so the production doesn't stop cause halting everything is more expensive than just building generic models that satisfy a great customer base. Every manufacturer does this they just market it differently. So if everyone would be waiting for sales the production would slow down further and so the pool for sale cars would as well. Same would happen if everyone bought directly and all capacity was used for "on comission" cars.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 10:09:32'] Report I saw was Teslas were like out of 90% of customers budget, and noone can build them for less than Tesla.

If the market expects rates to drop along with the stock market, they‚Äôll see capital appreciation on their bonds right when they want to buy up equities. Sure, you could make more money on short positions if you can time it, but maybe there‚Äôs low confidence on timing the start of a correction. If longer DTE options have low IV, shouldn‚Äôt smart money be exploiting this? Are we just too dumb to accept this insanely counterintuitive low volatility?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 18:32:32'] Appreciate the SPX piece at the end. I tried playing SPX a few days ago and the premium movement made no sense and o was complaining about the no linearity of it. You explained it much better than I could . Honestly - it felt like even when the move went your way - and it surpassed - you needed a lot more movement to turn a profit. I appreciate theta decay - but beyond that drop - the same strike price shouldn‚Äôt yield much lower premiums.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 12:03:11'] FRC has delayed their earnings to after market Monday the 24th. Do you think it could be a downside catalyst? They were supposed to report last Friday with other big banks but rescheduled. In my opinion if other banks are going to fail anytime soon bad earnings and guidance would have to be the catalyst. If the banks escape earnings season then it seems like smooth sailing for a while even if the Fed hikes a time or two more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 09:18:48'] Tesla has a problem. It just does not know it yet. Why do I say that?- India is locked out and ultimately Chinese buyers will buy local. - south America will buy brands with better value (Chinese)- they cannot command huge premiums as more automakers release more cars. Many folks I know are considering mach-e, lucid, rivian and Kia. - their factories will age- the current reason they can show lots of sales is simply because of the backlog. When they finish working through the backlog it will be harder to win customers- cars last for a long time (unlike phones) and people's needs change. - some folks I know are souring on elon[backlog analysis ](https://insideevs.com/news/615583/estimated-tesla-order-backlog-september21-2022/)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 09:53:34'] Dude, where were all of you complainers when United employees got laid off and lost their pensions in 2008? üòÇ A company has to make money and the sad fact of the matter is that employees are liabilities. Cut losses quickly when you see what‚Äôs coming to save your company. This will save the jobs of those who remain afterwards and future jobs by cutting a few. Or‚Ä¶ the company could lose a ton of money and cut wages/salaries/benefits and then everyone would quit because they can‚Äôt make a fair wage/salary/can‚Äôt afford high benefit costs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 09:57:13'] Depends on who they are laying off. Now that they suddenly have to compete with a lot of very good to excellent vehicles in every market segment, Tesla is simultaneously over-committed to production, and under-invested in interior design.There are a lot of people -- maybe the majority -- who care more about having a familiar cockpit and controls, like the EV6 and BZ4X, than they do about additional horsepower and tweaks to the suspension.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:18:45'] Electric trucks without autonomous driving is an environmental step forward but not a big increase in reducing expenses.Elon's entire net worth is tied up in the idea that his electric cars will drive themselves Soon‚Ñ¢. As soon as people realize that shit isn't happening, they'll buy whichever electric is cheapest for their purpose.This is a PR stunt and nothing more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 12:35:52'] As a former PepsiCo employee I feel bad for all current employees. Apparently PepsiCo has enough money to buy Tesla Semi trucks but not enough money to list their employees as ‚Äúfull time employees‚Äù with benefits. They keep a lot of their employees as ‚Äúpart time employees‚Äù even though they make them work 60+ hours a week. For those wondering the difference between ‚Äúpart time‚Äù and ‚Äúfull time‚Äù (in my area) is + $8 or more per hour as well as full medical, dental, 401k, life insurance, paid vacation time, extra sick days. But sure PepsiCo, spend money on new trucks instead of paying your current employees fair wages lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:53:38'] the next 30 years of growth is priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 20:30:44'] Am I the only one who is going to say it is NOT priced in? I mean, it's "priced in" but it's not REALLY priced in. Tesla is insanely undervalued because people,  especially "automotive analysts" STILL don't know how to properly value Tesla and all that they do. Most prices targets are following the stock around and being influenced by FUD instead of predicting a thing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 09:08:18'] they promised to start deliver these in 2020, and still nothing. This is more demonstrative of a management & supply chain failure than a surprise win. if they thought that this would become a major part of their business and not just a gimmicky hype train, wouldn't they have built a couple of semi factories by now to handle all the anticipated "demand"?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:27:11'] That picture is super airbrushed, would believe him if he posted an actual truck, not rolling down a slope preferably, with something Pepsi on it. So, maybe, no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 13:44:31'] Anyone else kind of hoping this will be a (non-fatal) monumental failure so Musk shuts the fuck up for 10 minutes? He's like a commercial that plays 20 times a day. The same shit, ad nauseam, in an attempt to force bullshit upon others. If he'd shut the fuck up for a week I honestly could hate him less. Not much, microscopic amounts less, but less none the same. He's still a huge dirtbag. The Twitter ticker on the building last week was so correct lmao. Thank fuck he was born in Africa, President Musk sounds like nails on a chalkboard.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:50:18'] in the past, i could see elon musk coupling this event with a bunch of fanciful musings about how much money theyll be making when its fully autonomous and batteries are 10x as energy dense or some such, but i don't think people besides the musk fanbois are going to be as responsive to it this time, if the ai day event was any indication.there are key metrics tesla has been deliberately withholding up until now so unless that gets cleared up today and turns out to be better than expected then i'd say its all priced in.  although even then, I wouldn't be super surprised to find out that after a few months pepsi does their own measurements and determines the values delivered by tesla to be unrealistically optimistic / based on only the most ideal of use cases.theres an outside chance something embarrassing happens as well, so at best it feels like a "sell the news" situation to me.in the interest of full disclosure im currently holding several TSLA Puts, so i may be a bit blinded by bias in wanting to see my predictions be correct.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:41:45'] How?  Like seriously I work in trucking how?  Best electric battery car life on a tesla is 405 miles (most are like 350).  I am going to take a 65mph highway average thats like 6 hours 15 minutes drive time.  Drivers are required to take a 30 minute break at 8 hours.  They are allowed to drive 14 hours in a day.  No driver is going to waste hours of drive time a day charging their truck.  Also the truck needs to fully charge in that 30 minutes or its pointless.  These are best case scenarios, the technology isn't there to make it work at this time its not and where the hell are you pulling a semi into a supercharger.This is just stupid
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:51:28'] I think it's quite underestimated what the impact these Semi's will have to Tesla's earnings.  Huge potential here and glad to finally see them in production.  Up next: Cybertruck
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 09:54:13'] If it's not Coke it's pepsi! Pepsi the second choice of a generation! Funny this one semi took only 750,000 pounds to 1,500,000 million pounds of earth, to create just the EV battery alone! Not to mention the carbon footprint just to extract the materials for the battery alone. And this EV battery is charged with fossil fuel energy in the form of electricity.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 14:05:07'] If this is anything like the Series 3 rollout, **here's what Pepsi can expect:**An email thanking them for their deposit, telling them delivery is roughly a year away.Another email a few months later telling them it's really 18 months away.Another email a month after that telling them that the original specs where there are leather seats in the cab was incorrect. Seats are cloth only.Another email a month after that telling them delivery is now two years away.Another email a month after that telling them that while there were color selections available at the time the deposit was made, the only color their ordered model comes in is black.Another email just a few days later telling them that all their original selections for interior and color are still available and delivery can be made in two to three weeks instead of two years or so, but they'll have to change to the model that costs 50% more than the one they ordered.I kept all those emails, Elon, you lying slavering maggot. Every single one. And I have the calls recorded where I called your San Francisco office as the email said to demand a refund and was told it would take a month "because lots of people have been asking for refunds." I bet they had.Also the one where a month later I called again and told the asshole on the other end that if I didn't get a refund in three days I would file fraud charges with my blue state's  Attorney General. And I have the refund check that arrived three days later, you lying pile of festering vomit.Do not believe a single word this deranged lying narcissistic sociopath says about **anything**.He lies the way normal people draw breath.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:45:17'] Jeez this month long low volatility is really frustrating. Both bear and bulls are fucked so hard. Tilted.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:37:06'] I have a hard time figuring out when resistance is actually broken. How high above the resistance line does a price have to go to confirm? Is large volume on the break needed? Does it need to close the day above the line? I traded a stock that broke resistance today and it came crashing down 20 minutes later and I was DUPED. Thanks!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:18:27'] One of the biggest benefits of SPX options is that there's no longer a fear of entering a trade in the second half of the day only to see your broker sell you out of it an hour before close.  For those of us poor people with accounts below an imposed algo limit, those last five to ten minutes can sometimes generate another turn to three of profit.&#x200B;Unless you're jumping into SPX in the futures market, you have 6.5 hours to make the right decision.  A broker taking away  at least 15.4% of your time even though you're paying for all 6.5 hours and a commission (or PFOF or both) is robbery in my eyes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:06:51'] Loaded Vix calls for 5/19 and 6/16 with some SPX puts for 6/16 as well. Deployed 50% in the off chance this clown market pushes to 420 somehow.But bearish divergence on the hourly and close to oversold on the daily with a bearish divergence yesterday. Vix also bouncing near a long trendline from earlier in the year.I think your long puts will be fine. This reminds me of that bulltrap months ago when AAPL was also pushing ATHs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:43:40'] Hey DaddyD,One of the main reasons why I've been trading SPX instead of SPY is the white wash sale rule. As I understand, it doesn't apply to SPX since it's an index, but it applies to SPY because it's an ETF.I think I have a good understanding on how the rule applies to trading stocks, but not fully clear on the options. Is each option contract (different strike price and/or exp date) considered a separate equity? Or, if you day trade SPY options, you can't offset gains of one contract with the losses from another contract.I'd greatly appreciate anyone's comment on this. Thanks!PS: SPY options are much more liquid, and much better spreads.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 17:39:28'] Lower VIX isn't necessarily bearish. I think it's time to get constructive here. While I do think we are due for a near term dump, since markets don't go up in straight lines, it's time to face facts that we are in a new market regime. VIX hitting lower lows in the face of degenerating macro conditions is the same thing we saw during the COVID bull run, meanwhile all the bears were losing their ass shorting through that.Doesn't mean we'll have a massive 1 month rally that takes us back to ATH, since we don't have the fed printer to help. Instead a sideways chop biased to the upside. There's a high chance statistically that this bear market is over, and that downside is limited.

So much smoother and barely any interventions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 12:14:18'] I‚Äôve been on FSD beta for almost 2 years. I‚Äôve also rented many Tesla without FSD. I would rather have FSD than not. It‚Äôs not months away from robo taxis but it could be a year or two. It‚Äôs not flawless but it‚Äôs pretty good. I definitely miss it when I just have basic autopilot. I‚Äôd buy it again for $7k but $15k  is a bit much, that price for family use is ridiculous. We‚Äôve been trying to shop for a used Tesla lately and it is amazing how many of them do not have FSD. This is probably due to the high cost of it. Tesla‚Äôs gonna have to decide whether they want a lot of people to buy some thing that is affordable or if they want a few people to buy something that is it not affordable for most.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 08:19:03'] fsd is still garbage. It still randomly slams on the breaks on the highway.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 08:44:09'] I drove in one about a month ago. It's good on freeways, bad on small streets. Like... Really not good on side streets. I like Tesla as a long term investment, especially with the algorithmic learning and large data sets that they have. But FSD is not near taxi levels and probably won't be for a long while.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 08:17:06'] It's very far from being good enough. There's plenty of bad videos on Twitter. It's superficially better now but still can't handle many edge cases.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-19 07:59:55'] >It is difficult to say how long it would take for Tesla to get approval from regulators to run a robotaxi service, as the regulations surrounding such services are still in flux.

I suspect the two models will be some smaller hatchback model 2 and a last mile delivery van. If he gets anywhere close to 50% reduction on costs good luck to everyone else. Their general efficiency advantages in every vertical means it‚Äôs a good long term play. An easily seen scenario will be that sometime in 2023 he will release a new model. Stock will spike. Generally once people digest the long term strategy this will prob jump back to 205-215 quickly. But it may go down to 125 in the meantime.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 12:42:06'] Tesla is going down imo. 1. Ev is growing as a segment amongst Ford, Kia, Toyota, Audi, soon to be every manufacturer  2. Family owned dealerships that sell to local areas with long established buyers 3. Orders from USPS and School systems for EV vans, 18-wheelers, and Postal vehicles from Ford, Thomas, and International. Consumers are unsure of Tesla trucks 4. Engineers leaving Tesla to work elsewhere (Not sure the contact non-compete agreements) 5. No real knowledge of consumer wants and needs example Cybertruck vs F-150 6. Lack of repair and parts to complete repairs i.e no dealerships with garages and certified technicians ‚ÄîI could keep going. Personally I think Tesla will have to sell the name brand. Tesla is a fad financed by the govt to promote the sale of EVs and for R&D of batteries plus motors. I really don‚Äôt see Tesla making it within the next 5 years even.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 14:25:48'] One thing that Tesla super bulls don't acknowledge is the pandemic auto bubble dynamics. They believed that Tesla's huge profit margins from 2021-2022 were the new norm. And that Tesla could continue to scale huge unit volume growth while maintaining those new profit margins. The reality is that there was a global auto shortage due to supply chain issues. In response, dealerships were charging 10-15k over MSRP in order to maximize profits. The dealerships increased prices like crazy, not the legacy auto makers. Dealerships benefited, legacy auto makers benefited much less so.Now Tesla doesn't have dealerships since they sell direct, but they followed what the dealerships were doing and increased prices like 15k on the Model Y. Their COGS didn't go up nearly as much as inflation in materials spot prices since they were locked into long term contracts. As a result their profit margins sky rocketed. Before the auto shortage Tesla had 2% net margin, 6% operating margins, 21% gross margin. In 2022 they peaked at 15% net margin, 16.5% operating margins and 26.6% gross margin.The pandemic auto bubble is now deflating. The supply of new vehicles is back in balance with demand. Dealerships and Tesla are having to slash prices like crazy to drive sales. They are going to see huge margin compression as a result. The 2021-2022 margins were a fluke due to the auto supply shortage. Add to that the macro economic challenges - high inflation and high interest rates on auto loans. That and recession worries will cause consumers to second guess expensive purchases. Furthermore, all the people who way overpaid for cars (including Teslas) in 2021-2022 may end up walking away from those horrible loans because they're underwater 20k on the resale value of their vehicle. The used car market could very well be flooded with a huge number of low mileage used cars if the economy takes a downturn. Lastly, as Tesla continues to prioritize unit volume growth they'll have to continue to slash prices to reach more people as they will quickly run out of consumers willing to pay the higher prices for the vehicle. Tesla is going to experience years of margin compression as they grow volume and try to tap mass market vehicles. They'll have high unit volume growth and top line growth. But bottom line growth (earnings) is going to slow tremendously. The bull thesis is being heavily challenged, even if Elon making good progress towards growing unit volume and his mission statement.

Where does the vast majority of budget for road improvement/construction come from? Gas tax. If everyone had EVs charging off the grid- could it support that level of energy consumption? Not in the slightest. So, what does that tell me? The gov will require the car companies to report out your mileage (potentially travel habits) and you will have to pay a set rate per mile to the irs every April. They will also say ‚Äúour energy grid cannot support this level of charging..‚Äù‚Äùwe need to reinvigorate our National energy grid‚Äù (excuse for trillions wasteful spending to raise our already gargantuan debt) and will end up like the California rail project.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello fellow investors, this is the story of how I lost 20K in a single day trading tesla.\n\nLet me start out by saying that I did not yolo into puts, I was actually smart about it.\n\nMy story begins before Monday, I wend back 72 weeks and took the absolute value of weekly tesla percentage move, so last week tesla was up 9% I would take 9 and put it into my table. I did this to calculate the average weekly tesla move and then use this data to sell calls or puts. \n\nMonday: tesla started the day being 7.5% up (average tesla weekly move over 72 weeks was 7.68%) I took this as an opportunity to sell puts and call. ( I sold 7 jan 27 129 puts and 6 jan 27 155 calls). I waited. \n\nWednesday: 2 hours before market close I sold 4 more jan 27 157.5 calls. At this point my breakeven including all the premiums received was 160. keep in mind that last week tesla closed at 133 so that would be a 20.5% move. I though that this was a great trade as tesla only had 1 week over the past 72 with a weekly mov'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 09:47:01'] Lost 20k and starts the explanation with ‚ÄúBut I was smart about it‚Äù Classic tism
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:16:16'] Let's count all the implicit assumptions you made while being "actually smart":1) Past volatility is a good gauge of present volatility.2) Only final gain/loss for the week captures that volatility (ignoring all the price movement during those weeks).3) 72 weeks is a sufficient sample size (this misses the huge upside volatility beginning of 2020)4) Expected weekly volatility is not conditional on price action early in the week.  Thus, even when the stock surges on Monday, the expected weekly movement is whatever the past 72 week average is, still.5) Despite this week, you still assert that "your math is correct".Amazing.> Anyway I am only 20, so I will have time to make a comeback.You have no idea how true this is, but only if you learn your lesson which you haven't.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:45:52'] Yes,  could of worked but the stock had been compressed for so long,  higher **exponential** move probability.  I think the real issue was the level of exposure you had on these trades,  not the trade itself..So learn from the risk/reward postioning..  Each postion shouldnt be move than 10% of you portfolio;  I assume it was.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 22:46:18'] Take a look at the documentary, "Trader" made in 1987, and stars Paul Tudor Jones.One of the most important pieces of information in there he gave was to plan out your max loss before you put on the trade instead of dreaming about how much you could be making on those trades. That way, you will be one of the most successful investors.The beauty with that documentary was that they actually filmed him, making a heavy loss, losing about 5%. But he lived another day when the market broke out, and they made it back and then some. You'd think it was scripted, but the market couldn't be scripted. Sometimes life does drop some gems for us to wonder.

Where the fuck did you get 20 k from? My guess is your parents which actually makes you pretty fucking stupid, I could give 20k to millions of poor 20 year olds in this world and they would be smart enough to create millions with it. But you managed to loose it all in one day because of your obsession with mr Elon (who btw is the richest man In the world because of dumb smuks like you), and yet you still managed to be narcissistic enough to think you we‚Äôre smart! Grow up, learn and pipe down fella!

Or alternatively anyone got reading material or video I can watch to learn more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 17:21:11'] Probably you have now learned like the shorts who had lost billions (but made billions too while Elon was selling). Timing is very important in Options and with that kind of earnings, simple answer: don‚Äôt mess with Tesla. Elon has shit load of fans and big funds like Ark buying tons of Tesla shares. Don‚Äôt try to go against it, rather ride it

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 18:27:53'] I did something similar with $BOIL. I bought a far-dated put well in the money, calculated the weekly moves over three years on a percentage basis, averaged those moves +5% to estimate how far out of the money I should wheel weekly options.I was doing well for the first few weeks, but eventually volatility and share price dropped such that I sold the shares more than 50% down and decided to sell the long put as well. Total loss was much smaller as a sum, but it touched my net worth.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 00:45:27'] I have a few flaws to point out,1: doing this on earnings week and expecting an average move is dumb2: you didn't say what your average value for those 72 weeks of absolute change %'s in weekly tesla moves was, so lets pretend it was 5%.    TSLA moves up 7% on Monday, so rather than saying "hey a potential outlier, lets not trade it this week" or looking for data on what happens by the end of the week on average when TSLA pumps hard on a Monday, you decided this means the direction was going to be bullish and sold puts.  Lets assume it did revert to the average, that could mean either going down 2% to +5%, or going down to -5%.  It doesn't mean it'll stay up, it is equally likely that it goes all the way down to -5% because you're using the absolute values.3: 100$ 10% down followed by 10% up isn't 100$, it's 99$.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 01:27:18'] You are not using statistics right buddy. Or the right statistics that matter.   You have to read the incerto book series by Nassim Nicholas Talib. At least do yourself a favor and read the black Swan by the same author.  Highly improbable does not translate into impossible. Don't make huge bets on highly improbable events. You will win most of the time but when you lose you will lose your ass.  Winning a lottery is highly improbable but people do win. It is the same for the downside, looking at a five year chart of s&p 500  a 10-15% daily move is highly improbable but it has happened.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 20:54:28'] Did you separate out earnings week and understand how much it moved on earning weeks?  Have you heard of ‚Äúrun up to earnings‚Äù which usually starts about 10 days.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 21:52:32'] Here is the good news Regard : you can roll over your sold calls, if you do it far enough, the strike price can even be significantly higher than are your current calls. Calls never lose bro, you just roll over
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 16:40:42'] I feel for you. It‚Äôs a very artificial rally based on misunderstanding of the data at hand along with the rally of the rest of equities. Are market participants that ignorant to the fact that earning estimates have been seriously downgraded over the past weeks/months and so a beat that we see in earnings really isn‚Äôt a beat? Pair that with the senseless hopes for a pivot from the fed and you get a buncha regards doing regarded shit. Story will change come next week. Mark this comment and come back to it in 5 days.

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. * Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. * I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. * The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.# FAQ - Because others have already asked.* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.* Are you entering all these plays?   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.* Where are the crayons? I only see words.    * Click the links above.* Have you back-tested this?   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)* What is the historical performance?   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.88 with a 66% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 60% and 78%. (Stats as of 2023-01-31)

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 15:03:04'] The best part about the "mean" line is that you can choose where it goes based on where you choose to look. That looks like the mean of the past four years. If you looked further back it would be alot lower and if you looked from 2021 and up until now it would be alot higher. Furthermore, i'm not convinced that's even the actual mean over that timespan.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 09:28:00'] It has been an eye opener. Tesla‚Äôs cars really are the best, but the number of people who are freaking out about Musk‚Äôs actions on Twitter in a particular dramatic and reductionist manner and in turn saying they‚Äôll punish Tesla for it is large. I‚Äôm not sure what to think. On the one hand, a car is a large purchase, and Tesla makes the best EVs no question. On the other, some of the original cadre of Tesla buyers were purchasing on an environment basis and as a political statement alongside the cars quality.  I don‚Äôt know if this will be material. It certainly hasn‚Äôt flipped their reputation in red states where you can get definitely get made fun of for having a Tesla.I think marginal stock pricing may be getting pushed a bit on the same dynamics. Owning Tesla stock as esg surely is related to owning a Tesla as esg‚Ä¶Or maybe this is just car loans being so expensive and they are past most of the people who pay with cash‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 15:44:44'] Bond and stocks only in opposite direction in absence of monetary policy. For the past 2~3momth the market was pricing in a drop in inflation, coupled by a ease in rates and therefore increased liquidity from the fed - this is very bullish and the market rallied. You also can see similar effect during the bear market last year, as well as during covid crash.with how hot PPI came in the expectation has somewhat reversed, and now bonds and stock moves hand-in-hand again. IMO theres some very interesting trades to make here, I tried shorting bonds as a hedge at the begining of last year and it worked out well at the time, though eventually i went back to stocks
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 16:01:40'] After all that I have seen from this fed I dont think JPOW will do a 50 bps hike even though it would be the right thing to do. I dont see a massive market dump like we have seen in the past, we probably hover between 395 - 415 till the D-day. Earnings were for most part better than expected and there is not much real case for a recession right now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 15:51:35'] If tomorrow is not red and not the beginning of a new down trend, I don't think we ever gonna have a strong sell off again until next earning season at least. The market is on drug lately, every risky company (companies that not profitable) is getting pump like crazy. There are some weird things going lately for sure... from cpi before and ppi morning today, it's just weird...
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 16:11:38'] Market analysis and speculations are very similar to mine.  As much as I like seeing my bias confirmed, the one thing I believe could help the market rebound tomorrow is the enormous number of puts expiring, as was mentioned.  We'll see what the trends look like tomorrow, but my gut tells me the real bleeding will start next week.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 19:59:02'] Remember I told you we'd sell into OPEX? Well, we kinda did, but this is not the kind of price action that's convincing to me as a bear. Wednesday should have been a deep red day, supportive flows were muted that day, but yet, no drop. Today there should not have been a huge intraday bounce today, the price action is showing that there is still too much dumbfuck money lying around ready to buy the dip. The thing is that big money HAS covered their shorts, but they still HAVE NOT chased the rally. Won't be surprised if we hit 400, only for them to "buy the dip" in huge volume.Crashes only usually happen after a blow off top, where big money is 100% invested, and we're just not there yet. Unfortunately, I think the drill will be delayed. If bears cannot take us into deep negative gamma by next week, they're fucked, as this window of weakness is very small. Consolidation instead of drilling next week will mean another leg up.Cem Karsan explained it today:https://twitter.com/TDANetwork/status/1626241991393570816
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 15:55:50'] Today for me sucked because of carelessness, tried to play a rejection off that 409.5 level around 10 and managed to instead time my buy right before we blew threw it and started our rally that lasted until Bullard. Wouldn‚Äôt have been terrible but when we almost immediately came back down below for a minute I was emotionally trading and took it as a sign of a false breakout instead of it being SPY retesting 409.5 to establish support. Held the puts until they were down 25% before cutting them and as a final f.u. I got an awful fill and managed to knock out my gains from the last week. Thinking we get one last retest of 408.8 and maybe also that 409.5 area tomorrow. Do agree now that we closed below those levels we should see 405 tomorrow, and Max Pain makes me even more confident that we will, so my plan is to see where we open and play short dated ~407P (but not 0DTE) opened around 10-10:30. All relevant scheduled events I can find will be over by then and I think we might finally get a nice red trend day into that level.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 20:29:12'] Problem with this thesis is that January CPI is likely hot from December, and rate hikes take a while to move through the money supply. And since January/February are slower months for retail and many layoffs occurred in December, you‚Äôre going to potentially see surprising beats on CPI/PPI the next two months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 00:10:02'] FED seems to be the best market manipulators, inflation is still high, we are gonna raise up interest rate to fight the inflation and Dow jones will fall into deep red.Inflation seems to be cooling down, we might have a chance to stop the rate hike, Dow Jones rises up.All the people in FED just looks alike a bunch of clown in my eyes, especially Jerome Powell. The main cause of inflation is because of the war in Ukarine and covid situation when China are pursuing zero covid and caused some disruption on the delivery and transportation of goods around the world.Now China had given up on pursuing zero covid, the transportation and delivery of goods around the world are starting to ease up.The only reason for the inflation is because of the war in Ukraine, Ukraine are one of the big source of country for grains, and once grains are facing shortage around the world, this causes inflation. Russia are producers of oil and gas, and since many countries are going for the expensive way to avoid buying oil and gas from Russia. Of course inflation goes up without coming down.No matter how much % interest rates FED are going to raise, it won't truly beat down the inflation rate. Because the main problem is still the war in Ukarine.What a bunch of FED Jokers talking about economics

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 16:50:46'] Didn't Bullard say he was open to a 50 bps increase prior to the Feb FOMC? Yet the market shrugged that off. Why is this time different? Is it just the tipping point?&#x200B;This time both Bullard and Mester seem to be endorsing 50 bps, and Mester kind of does.'... she thought even before the release of the jobs and CPI data that her  colleagues were not being aggressive enough with their most recent rate  hike. "I saw a compelling economic case for a 50-basis-point increase,"  she said.'"Mester told reporters after her remarks that she's not ready to say how  big a rate hike the central bank should deliver at its March 21-22  meeting."How can she say there was a compelling economic case for 50 bps prior to hot CPI and PPI, but not be willing to say how much we should be looking at in March? Is this purposefully playing the game to give markets a heads-up without coming out and directly saying it?Also, not sure how much weight is given to this, but neither Bullard or Mester are voting members right? It seems like the market has been more willing to dismiss comments from non-voting members in the past.I guess we'll see how tomorrow and next week goes.

If we gap down tomorrow and open around 406/405 I'll look for a short cover rally if there isn't follow thru selling. [See if futures can bounce hard off 4060 if it gets down there overnight.](https://i.imgur.com/RzYul9u.jpg)Reasoning for short cover rally is, I really doubt we have a big red day out of this 10 day range we've been in, with FOMC next week.

They were citing lack of liquidity in the article.  Lack of volume may be indicative of what they are speaking about.&#x200B;0DTE options are carrying trillions in notional value daily and have seen a 40% spike in YoY volume per the article.&#x200B;In 2022, From Jan 1 through Feb 16 there were 19 trading days (over half)  with over 100M in volume and in 2023, in the same period, there have only been 3.&#x200B;That could potentially set up something worse.

Literally got a bunch of CHILDREN working in mines to make sure Tesla can meet the demand and keep up with their now global supply chains where the number 2 in charge is a Chinese workaholic right when Norinco and the Biden Administration are going into the Congo to figure out what exactly has been going on with all the deaths at the mines.When you are the richest person in the world and you can turn a tragedy of your own making and design flaws into a selling point to get more government and investor support to try and solve a problem you as the richest person on the planet who is much more concerned about going to a different planet and wreaking havoc there, who has dozens of law suits and out of court settlements involving your own (Elon Musk) attacks and bullying people because you're the rich troll who can.Tesla is nothing more than a Congolese Child labor making machine, killing kids trapping them underground with no future where they get electric vehicles and a green future. The Kids digging the raw materials for the last two decades dying to make sure Tesla batteries are on every road around the world where the people and governments paying for the supply chain are just ignoring the reality by staring at the multitude that is the cloud and ignore the dead kids that make the car go zoom zoom. APPLE batteries are literally grains of rice compared to a TESLA battery so imagine how hard those kids must have to work to ensure your new electric car has the range to keep up with your James Bond Bruce Wayne Tom Brady wanna be life styles. Get over yourselves all of you who keep buying Tesla and are convinced CATL and China will stop using child labor or the US will be able to do a damn thing about it anytime soon. Nope you would rather support an industry that doesn't have a real ability to say they HAVEN'T been using child labor so now, in 2023, after cobalt and lithium mining has been going on for decades to produce up to the demand that is ever sky rocketing, there is more talk about possibly using blockchain or providing more infrastructure to Congolese people suffering and working to death.Amazing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 20:16:58'] Seriously?  This is a joke right?  It looks like  a group of engineers had 3 weeks to cobble a robot together to justify their budget.  Does it run on an old X-Box and a raspberry pi?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 19:38:37'] Nope. This can fuck off to whatever eternal limbo the Cybertruck fucked off to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 07:04:32'] How much will they lose per car now?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 07:34:36'] I think part of it is that \*every\* Tesla model is electric and they got their price cut. Ford only has a few electric models. Like the F-150 isn't going anywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 08:36:44'] Regard. Mach-e is meaningless when Ford makes 99% of its money from the F-150. Tesla cut the price of everything it sells. When US truck prices get slashed 20% then we‚Äôll talk
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 15:12:04'] TSLA has highest profit margins per vehicle than other carmakers do for their EV I think. They have more room to continue to cut prices and still be profitable. Elon says demand ain't an issue but he lies so who knows.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 06:47:30'] >I'm not sure where the posts are, but I can tell you that Tesla's price cuts were much more significant than Ford's. Tesla was essentially cutting prices by $2,000-$3,000 per car, while Ford is only reducing prices by $1,500 on its Mach-E SUV.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 09:03:15'] Mach-E looks way better than the Model Y.Waiting for another couple of years before jumping into the EV bandwagon.Until then my Honda accord will do fine

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 13:12:17'] Ford has an electric truck on the road, also a sporty EV, also two hybrid pickups, also a huge stable of competitive vehicles actively produced. Also model T fame. They have a massive aftermarket arm, crate engine arm, racing pedigree. Also, I don‚Äôt see old Henry out here siring offspring with a harem of gestational carriers sourced from his subordinate pool. He also ain‚Äôt out here word vomiting on Twitter while spreading his investments thin on margin to troll other rich guys he has a grudge with.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 12:32:27'] All they had to do what keep the body of the regular mustang, and add in electric motors. Or even better, not name it a Mustang. Name it what ever horse name you can find, but if you're going to call it a mustang, people are going to expect something that follows most of the mustang recipe.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q1 2023 financial results today after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Teslas management are scheduled after the results.

For the noobies, a straddle is an options strategy where we buy both a call option and a put option on the same underlying stock with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy is typically used if we believe the stock price will experience a significant price movement but is unsure of direction. Grabbing the 4/21 190c and 170p doesn't seem like half bad idea. The stock will certainly move

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 23:48:38'] It‚Äôs a $3k discount for built cars that weren‚Äôt sold, as long as you buy it before 2023. If anyone decides to buy one he‚Äôs one grand fucking idiot, because starting 2023 the government incentive will kick in and you‚Äôll get 7.5k instead of 3k.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-01 19:30:45'] They have scale and design leadership, so they should be able to produce EVs more cheaply. But every time they discount prices they drop their profits. And Lithium batteries cost what lithium batteries cost to produce. As soon as Tesla has to sell themselves lithium batteries at a transfer price below market, they're making themselves a target for a hostile takeover.

I'm not buying in on hype when it's clear that Tesla has major problems outside its control.Remember when Musk sided with China over Taiwan? Remember when Musk suggested Ukraine should give up land for peace?That's a dude who sees that two of his giga factories are screwed if China doesn't stabilize and Germany can't get cheap natural gas.Without natural gas that whole giga factory Berlin will be too expensive to operate. There's no way he can make production goals and if he tries it will cost far more than he's selling cars for.You know what that will do to the share price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 16:48:21'] The news of Tesla's Gigafactory Mexico is certainly interesting, and it will be intriguing to see how this plays out in the coming days. However, I can't help but feel that this is yet another example of Elon Musk trying to take advantage of poor people and workers. The fact that he is planning to locate the factory in a economically disadvantaged area just shows how little he cares about those who will be working there. I hope that Tesla's shareholders force him to change his plans, or at least make sure that the workers are treated fairly. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 01:07:14'] Not so fast Musk. I have test driven some EVs recently and I think Model Y has some serious competition. The Benz EQB, VW ID.4, Kia EV6, Hyundai Ioniq 5, etc are all serious competition to Tesla. The reason they didn't make a dent until now was the lack of supply and dealer markups. Now that both problems are gone, I would be surprised why anyone would consider a Model Y? (I owned one and still own a Model S, and I can't see myself buying a Model Y over any of the four I mentioned above - the price to performance, and cabin comfort, etc are all the reasons to prefer them over Model Y).Tesla's order backlog is at the lowest in years, and there is barely any wait for orders placed now. So, I am worried if Tesla can keep the existing giga factories busy enough and if Tesla is building more capacity, as a consumer, I am happy because the only way Tesla can sell all these cars is by slashing the prices drastically. Tesla makes almost 25k per car so it probably isn't such a bad deal for them to slash prices by 5 to 10k easily. And that would prompt pricing pressure on others too. All in all, we as customers are going to win. I am not so sure about the shareholders though.

The Tesla truck is a great idea, but when you start looking into the costs of charging and looking at the range, including the life of the battery under massive charging rates, it's degradation and costs for replacing it are simply staggering it's ok on dead flat American roads but on hills with a full load?

As stupid as people are, more and more Muskrats are realizing that he's just some socially awkward rich bully who's been selling everyone false promises. $TSLA is propped up on nothing but wishful thinking and it's long term price will be going back to $0.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:47:35'] ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt make sense‚ÄùIf it would make sense, there‚Äôs was no money to be made
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:11:14'] Ford has been $10 for 10 years.  Before that it was $2.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:12:47'] When ever I see posts like this the stock usually goes up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:10:22'] So ‚Äúserious investors buy GM‚Äù? A company that went bankrupt last recession. Umm ‚Ä¶üôÑ
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:27:25'] I like how people shit on TSLA as an investment while conveniently ignoring that it's up 1000% in the last 5 years. Even their long time employees quit because they made enough money from the stock to retire.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:04:56'] The amount of stupidity and outright ignorance proclaimed with confidence in this thread is mind numbing.  If you have any real money and actually invest in the market, DO NOT listen to the shit posted in here.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:15:02'] If EV‚Äôs are indeed the future and Tesla‚Äôs competition is seriously ramping up their production in order to unseat Tesla as the EV market leader, I wonder if or why not Tesla wouldn‚Äôt focus on monopolizing fleet sales for service type vehicles. Public Works, Emergency vehicles and even public transportation (buses, taxis) they have a significant edge and would probably revolutionize the industry, again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:18:49'] Last quarter, Tesla‚Äôs net profit was greater than GM, Ford, Toyota. Let that sink in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:12:50'] Ford and GM üòÇü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:40:46'] This is so stupid
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:31:06'] One of the things that laymen miss in the Tesla evaluation is that it is a direct to consumer sales model, whereas trad auto companies use the dealership intermediary. The dealership network makes significant profit on parts, service, used sales, and financing and the network on the whole is larger employment and profit than the manufacturing. If Tesla is able to bring those items under direct management, it can be worth 2 or 3 GMs or Toyotas at fewer annual car sales volume.  If Tesla can both manage that vertical integration along with selling more cars, along with integrating first to full autonomous vehicles, and other Tesla infrastructure... then it might be valued significantly more.  But to say every single one of those gambles is going to be a winner is probably over optimistic.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:45:32'] Ford sold 3.084 million cars this year, $114B in revenue, ($8.925B) net LOSS, ($84B debt) How is Tesla overvalued? 0.9 million cars, $57B revenue, net income $8.8B, $3.2B in profit last quarter. 0 debt and $20B FCFFord loss per delivery: ($2,894) Tesla profit per delivery: $9,761
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:01:51'] Yeah... it's been overvalued for a while now. It's also in the S&P, so part of every serious investor's portfolio and basically auto-purchased by hundreds of millions of people on a regular basis.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:02:23'] Ford and GM: 200 years of combined manufacturing, labor, and supply chain logistics experience.Tesla: has Elon Musk.....
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:17:38'] Just keep buying the dip. Thank me later.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:55:57'] Just ramping up. Yes much more competition but they still hold first place in the Western market. China's BYD is outproducing them and that no doubt hits them in China. On the other hand you have the Austin and Germany plants ready to surge. You have the new battery tech and Maxwell technology in development. You have fewer parts per build than ever. You have the Cybertruck, Roadster and 18 wheeler near ready and I would expect something like a Golf or i3 in final stages of prototype. So no not overvalued. They are well beyond the competition and their only vulnerability was production capacity (and materials which is a problem for everyone). And really in the end their direct to consumer sales model is a substantial disruption - ala Dell Computer.  In the end you have to drive one to really get it. Hands down a better experience.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:12:04'] I'm not rich and never will be, but I am fairly comfortable.  One of my investment tenets is to avoid investing in companies or schemes that have serious nutcases at the helm.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:21:47'] I'm surprised Ford's stock is down. They didn't kill the RWD ICE Mustang because they sold enough Maches to have environmental credits. The Ford Escape platform is the Swiss army knife of Vehicle platforms. The Maverick, Mach E, Eco Sport and Bronco Sport are built on the escape platform. The regular Bronco is sold out. The Ford Lighting is mid though.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 15:25:28'] I have 750 shares of TSLA and I‚Äôm holding till 2030. The comments in this thread are so dumb. Like literally every person is talking out of their ass oblivious of what‚Äôs happened, happening, and going to happen. RemindMe! 7 years
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 15:20:49'] Tesla has done the best job of securing their supply chains with offtake agreements with mining companies. They are going to be producing higher range cars and suvs because they will have the nickel and lithium to do it why everyone else scrambles to catch up with ever increasing demand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:19:19'] All in TSLA and continuously buying. Not selling until 2030+. Currently down about 35% but I‚Äôm happy, I can keep loading up on these cheap shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:36:46'] Massively undervalued.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 00:37:15'] Anyone that bought Tesla before 2020 has killed it with multiple stock splits. GM and Ford has been trading sideways for years with no returns. Tesla is a technology company innovating at a rate no other company can complete with. GM and Ford are 20 years behind Tesla and will never catch them. I am also a big GM customer but you cannot go wrong with long term investment with Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 03:45:20'] Now that Elon is uncensored it‚Äôs time to short all of his companies
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 05:31:58'] I remember WSB in 2018-2019 when you guys were buying under $300 and selling over $300, pre-2-splits.Meanwhile a few of us were building a position to retire on and arguing with bears who couldn‚Äôt see what was about to happen. Today our group of Tesla bulls who made it big in 2020 have our own semi-private community, so we don‚Äôt post much on WSB anymore. We‚Äôre just patiently awaiting the inevitable next breakout.Do cash flow projections on them achieving 50% of what they‚Äôve planned and you‚Äôll see it still will be by far the largest company in the world in 2030. Tesla bears have always been wrong and it probably won‚Äôt change.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 20:46:04'] Tesla ain't a car company. So it's not competing against car companies.Tesla is Uber....Tesla is home automation...Tesla is energy grid.....Tesla is going to get into housing as well....You may hate Elon for what ever bullshit reason, but analytically you're a dipshit for betting against him.You don't think he'll integrate Twitter as a payment method and become the biggest bank overnight? You don't think he'll turn Twitter into something bigger than tiktok?Tesla is undervalued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:31:42'] Undervalued is the word, my friend!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:49:52'] The bulltards still think tesla is the only ev optionHeres reality-everyone else WILL catch up-tesla cars are ugly af and poorly madeThey have their spot but the market cap should be half of what it currently is
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:28:42'] Does the fact that Tesla is an energy company make a difference?  Tesla is cars, super chargers, solar panels, power walls. Does that make them a lot different than most automotive companies?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:50:39'] The only thing Tesla had going for it coming into this decade was lack of competition and momentum. Now that the other big-time auto makers have their eye on the EV scene, that really only leaves momentum on Tesla's scale.Their main hope right now is to try and muscle out the EV market by getting their own proprietary charging hardware adopted everywhere, but barring that, they're going to have to start actually competing. And given that GM is positiined to undercut Tesla by putting out a $30k electric SUV, that's going to be hard.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:14:39'] Yes. Only absolute fucking idiots think it's not
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:21:49'] The newest innovation is using the battery pack as part of the structural strength of the chassis which is expecting to move the mileage range to 600+ miles which is NOT a Tesla innovation

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:37:01'] Ford is deep in the red earnings-wise. Tesla‚Äôs P/E is only 10x of GMs rn. And we all know Tesla has lots of room to grow while GM is pretty much a cash cow. Didn‚Äôt GM lose billions into buying NKLA with 0 DD? Lmao
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:15:52'] Drive a Tesla around Detroit, park it on the street. Let me know how that goes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:18:06'] Go by PE ratio.  I‚Äôd buy an electric Silverado before a Tesla, neighbor bought a Bolt.  Tesla is overhyped and has competition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:41:05'] I don‚Äôt think electric cars are the future. At least with the current batteries they use. For one the E waste will be off the charts. There isn‚Äôt enough lithium to support all the new and replacement batteries that is going to need to happen. Charging takes too long
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:30:30'] Tesla is a Data/AI company that offers transportation‚Ä¶. Not a transportation company
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:16:38'] Shitty car company with PE of 100? Hell yeah it's overvalued. Still overvalued under $20.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:16:51'] Til ford and gm are not overvalued. SMH.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:01:47'] I‚Äôm going to throw this out there for consideration, not trying to be partisan in any way, this is a straight up economic observation.  Electric cars are designed obsolescence in a way that malaise era GM could only dream of.  I believe they are so bad that consumer debt levels can not support them long term, especially going into a long term recession they way we probably are.   They are practically disposable items because of the limited battery life/high replacement cost and can‚Äôt really be repaired if damaged.  I don‚Äôt see them long term, Toyota‚Äôs hydrogen program makes much sense from an investment point of view.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:52:51'] Tesla is valued like they have a patent on electric cars and no one else will ever be able to compete and they have a monopoly, which neither is true. Electric cars aren‚Äôt even sustainable and every in the auto industry knows it. Planned obsolescence. The batteries die in 10 years and cost more than the car to replace so no more cars over 10 years old. Meanwhile many people are driving their ICE cars from the 90s and early 2ks. And how do we sustainably deal with the batteries at end of life of the vehicle? No one has an answer and pretends like the problem doesn‚Äôt exist.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:28:29'] Tesla is overvalued. Soon they will have to reduce price to compete.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:51:17'] If you want to make money, short Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:20:49'] Where‚Äôs the lie?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:21:26'] I mean Tesla hasn‚Äôt gone bankrupt and they‚Äôre actually profitable Even tho electric cars are gay
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:41:12'] Yep 100%
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:38:47'] What about Toyota?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:48:28'] Overvalued is a understatement
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:40:47'] Honestly being invested in Tesla at this point is a loaded gun. Dude has no chill and doesn't seem to be worried that he'll cut off the left leg of his margins soon enough
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:56:04'] Given how much of Elon‚Äôs energy is going to be focused on twitter, I would think serious investors would be running from TSLA as fast as possible. Elon has flown too close to the sun.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:42:47'] Ihhhh I‚Äôd say yes. But Ford and GM? Bro those are going to die, they failed to adapt and their business model is something outdated . Tesla, and Rivian for the moment  and chill üëçüèΩ
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:57:43'] Yes. Tesla is a junk stock. Crappy, buggy products
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:22:45'] Twitters about to bankrupt Elon so yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:59:40'] It has always been over valued. Its a car company people. Theres no way it should‚Äôve been trading in the 800‚Äôs. 200‚Äôs after split.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:05:43'] Welp, considering 1/3rd of China's workforce is over the age of 65 and he thinks it's a good idea to open factories there, yeah, it's overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:10:51'] Not now that they‚Äôve dropped so much
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:40:06'] Given how butt ugly those cars are and the lack of profits from the company, it's one of those stocks that's only value is in it's popularity amongst fan boys.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:00:35'] TSLA PT $1
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:01:20'] Simple answer is Yes
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:07:12'] Rivian trucks boisssss
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:21:29'] Ford and GM are as efficient as govt; aka they‚Äôre not efficient at all. With labor unions running the show, Ford and GM will never fail. Too many American jobs at risk. We will see bailout after bailout, then bankruptcy, then another bailout.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:42:00'] Obviously over valued but it doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is if other people have realized this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:50:34'] PE of 60. Normal PE is around 20. I understand Tesla is having +50% growth of revenue with no competitor in the EV space.NOW, Tesla is entering 2023 with 10+ new competitors at the same time and with Elon Musk starting to not be liked and seen as cool by most of the tech people, rich people, educated people  and democrats. I see big challenges coming soon.I was extremely considering a Tesla few months ago and was ready to buy the hype. But now, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like the guy‚Äù and I‚Äôm not a potential buyer anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:12:19'] I would say that Tesla is WAY over valued. They do not produce and sell enough cars to support that value and their software is nowhere near as valuable and capable as some perceive it to be.The impending criminal case over the ‚ÄúFull Self Drive‚Äù marketing is likely going to cause ‚Äúsome‚Äù correction.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:48:12'] TSLA is good for day trading options because you can play it atleast 2-3 times a session. Easy pattern.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:50:29'] The thing with markets is they don't make sense. There's companies that have never made a profit valued at tens of billions of dollars. If you wanna make money on stocks you just have to understand the vibes

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:52:54'] Of course it is completely overvalued, but everything that musk says or does becomes gold‚Ä¶ you want to get  rich, just follow him and try to get as many assets from him.

And they'll get back to you, sometime. Not only that, he'll fix it remotely, without coming to your house!Panasonic ditched Tesla after the Buffalo fiasco, and Tesla had to turn to another mfr to make their panels for them (Hanwha). Solar roofs are pretty but only installed on no vent, south facing roofs, with no shading and perfect slope. When I call my contractor I just trusted with my $50k system, I expect him to answer the phone, and come to my house to fix it. The opposite of Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:41:37'] No ones really talking about just how bad high interest rates are to green tech. Wind & solar have very different capital requirements than oil & gas. Wind and solar power plants have the vast majority of their capital costs at the start of the project, where as oil/gas have their cost spread-out over the lifetime of the plant. As money gets more expensive a lot of these green tech projects stop making sense.

This is because certain banking institutions have extended credit to Mr. Musk which is partially secured by pledges of a portion of his Tesla common stock holdings. If the value of Tesla's stock decreases significantly, Mr.Musk may be forced to sell some of his shares in order satisfy these loan obligations.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 08:08:15'] At this point if you still take Musk at his word, after he's demonstrated time and time again to renege, you deserve what you get.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 08:33:22'] He be selling today. Just wait for after close.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 08:53:16'] Tesla is too volatile

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 10:35:21'] Saying one thing and doing something else doesn‚Äôt sound like Elon at all
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 10:36:21'] Well yea, obviously they aren't going to file an 10k that says Musk is locked in his shared for 2 years.He loaned money using his Tesla shares as collateral. So if he can't pay the interest on the loan, his shares will always get sold to raise money to make the payments. What it probably means is that he isn't intending to sell for taxes or other stuff. If you are a Teslatard and you only want it because Elon is hodling, that's probably a weird investment strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 11:09:09'] Elon is as trustworthy as RC

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 22:06:25'] Q4 is always big for these guys, and YoY only looks good because their acquisitions weren't included in the 2022 numbers. Look at exone's year over year sales numbers and you'll get a good idea of what a reasonable growth for DM is. None of the tech is revolutionary. Their projected growth is absolutely not going to happen. Furthermore, I don't know where you got the numbers for the studio system, but it's way off, that lifetime value and margin is the rosiest version of the story you could possibly tell. No chance these guys turn profitable IMO. They've had years to turn a profit, no reason they'd do it now.

Tesla is a highly disruptive company with value propositions outside of just EV, leading that huge space which already has unprecedented public support, by a unwavering loyal fan base and the government, and of course the brand of CEO that has left a mark and lasting impression in multiple industries he‚Äôs also disrupting. He‚Äôs obviously controversial and Tesla has had a known history of Cinderella story and target by hedge companies and shorted. Not to mention with other factors of incredible timing, market opportunity that lined up for them as well. It was a once in a lifetime type opportunity. DM at best is another profitable company with good prospects with appreciating stock price, not sure about the 10x return but agree it is shorted but lacking ingredients for huge alpha. Appreciate the DD, good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 17:21:24'] Short on Q4 earnings and long on Q1 earnings. Got it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 18:47:14'] Make sure you factor in roughly 10% of lower supply chain and production costs as well. So likely a 2%-3% hit on margins to further amass their lead in EV‚Äôs and put pressure on the legacy and failing automakers to shrink their already negative margins. Genius move.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 19:32:33'] Fair points. Though will say that tesla cuts price in face of huge ev tax credit and a recession too. Also this is a demand lever for them when the competition has no margins to cut prices and are just selling fewer cars. This is actually what's happening. I still think their margins will be far better than most.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 15:48:14'] If Tesla's market share fails to gain from the price cuts, you are 100% right. The question is will the cuts increase sales enough for a net positive.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 18:14:52'] Model 3/Y was lower priced in 2019 and 2020 than it is after today's price cuts. They were selling the base model for 35,000 off menu and the SR+ for 38,000. What were Tesla's margins in 2019? Why would they be any lower today after they have done tons of stuff to cut costs including removing Ultrasonics, radar, cheaper brakes? Model S and X were 70k and 85k in 2019, today they are both well over 100k. They use new one piece castings and they don't include homelink or auto-dimming mirrors anymore. It's probably way cheaper to make a Tesla today than in 2019 or 2020 and they are charging the same amount, sometimes a lot more. Also, even at your dubious margin prediction of 15%, their margins are still much higher than other automakers. BYD, Tesla's biggest competitor, has 2% margins after massive Chinese subsidies

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 15:03:43'] I see your point. However, if you wait closer to the Q1 results release to short, the new margin will already be factored into the price. TSLA will give revenue and margin guidance for Q1 during the Q4 earnings call. After that it will take a day or two for analysts to update their models and adjust PT. So, if you think Q1 margins will suck, the time to short is now.Also, given that Tesla already published deliveries for Q4, there won‚Äôt be any big earnings surprises next week. Everyone will look at the guidance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 15:07:54'] Tesla also reduced prices in Q4. Markets are forward looking so this will all already be incorporated after the dust from Q4 earnings settles.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-22 22:16:24'] Lol this is so regarded. Do more research on how they are cutting costs every quarter, rather than just using algebra to determine margins. Also every extra car they sell is going to be mostly pure profit since their fixed costs remain the same. But yes, please post your positions.

Ford is their biggest, domestic EV competition at this point, and F had 1.54% operating margin last quarter, compared to TSLA >17%. If Tesla is just a car company, your analysis shows exactly why they will out compete everyone else. So not only is the premise flawed, but you didn't even try any TA.Good luck with your position, friend.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 06:39:03'] I think what people are missing or maybe not. TSLA has crazy high margins . Most of the major crazy price hikes took place during the pandemic . Why ? Because they could, TSLA in my humble opinion took that opportunity to OVER inflate prices .They knew people where just shrugging their shoulders blaming the pandemic and supply chain issues. So it is a lot less painful for TSLA to give some back, They basically made their cars for the most part very competitive in the EV space. And still are retaining more margin % than the other auto makers. And all the folks that say their margin is going to be crushed and the stock is going to $30.40.50 or whatever don't take into account sales volume increases. AND THE BIG REASON: If you want an EV the ONLY manufacturer who has them readily available is you guessed it TSLA. All the other majors 6 month,s to 2 years wait. Statistical fact 72% of new car buyers buy a car because they need it not want it . So waiting is not an option

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 07:01:56'] Not so sure about Q1... the price cuts made those Tesla's available to qualify for the full $7500 tax rebate.  I think many customers would have waited until Jan 1 to take advantage of the federal tax incentives.  As a result we could see delayed purchases from Q4 into Q1.  IMO this will result in an ok Q4 which probably will not move the stock much one way or the other, Q1 will look good, but then Q2 will be a shit show especially as the cost of borrowing will continue to rise.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 06:04:58'] This is such terrible DD and just a needlessly risky bet overall. It‚Äôs not a matter of whether Tesla is overvalued at this point. You‚Äôre assuming Tesla will fall further after a major correction, and you‚Äôre timing is based on news that has already impacted the stock, which makes your thesis completely wrong. Many went broke shorting Tesla and most of them were without a doubt smarter than you (judging by how you entered BA shorts right after analyst downgrades).

So this puts musks paper spaceX stake around 20-25 billlion. A16z you‚Äôll recall put $500 million into the twitter deal. It‚Äôs all just one big ole circle jerk.

This thread reminds me of him.‚ÄúI would sell Tesla today (we are looking to short it) and while Google is a great company, they are a good investment because of their search business more than anything.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 08:16:11'] It's also more valuable than the 10 biggest car manufacturers combined, including Mercedes, Ford, Toyota, GM, Volkswagen etc. Even if you disregard the tens of millions of internal combustion engine cars, buses, trucks, vans those 10 companies make, they still make and sell more EVs than Tesla. Curious.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 05:57:01'] >Tesla is still worth more than the top 20 European banks combined.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 18:17:41'] People need to stop viewing Tesla as a car company and comparing them accordingly. They have never been a car company. They are a tech company that makes cars. In 20 years, cars will no longer be their primary product. Cars have just been a convenient vessel for them to develop their true product: robotic autonomy. The LiDAR path finding obstacle avoidance navigation systems they have could not have realistically been developed to the current level of success without a widespread test medium like a car that can be purchased by any end user. They have developed some of the highest performance AI and complementary processors as an intended byproduct of this investment.Tesla is a company that sells autonomy as a neatly bundled package unlike anything else on the market at the moment. In this regard, they dominate. But by all means continue complaining what a shit car company they are. But also see them for what they really are. There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre valued what they are. It‚Äôs not random.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-22 06:39:51'] I don't understand why Tesla made so much money so fast. Did they outsell Ford and etc by that much that quickly?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 16:55:17'] Window of weakness is closing for the bears...vanna and charm supportive flows come back next week full force. There is the old adage in the markets, "time is not a bear's friend". VIX had a huge red day, and bears have dropped the ball imo, unless they can put in a massive VIX spike tomorrow, I imagine we will consolidate in that channel you just said, 395-405 for the next few sessions then start a new leg up in March. The weak seasonality period is about to close.The bear market rallies that turn out to be the start of new bull runs, are the ones that everybody doesn't believe. The ones where the market goes up, and it doesn't make sense at all. Where all the bad news comes in, and it the market lightly reacts to it. That's why this one looks like the one. Is it possible for mega cap stocks like TSLA and NVDA to go back to new lows like they did in Oct, and Jan? AAPL, small caps, Dow Jones, all hugely up and showing relative strength, can a sell off really bring us back to October? Heavily doubt it...

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 19:37:42'] This is shit move by Elon. I am 100% sure twitter has some great engineers. Rather than leveraging in house expertise, he distrusts the ones that built everything and brings people from outside to shit on them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 02:17:38'] I am very confident they will succeed at whatever they are doing, sometime next year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 03:19:47'] People are up in arms about this, but tesla has an app and twitter is an app (mostly).
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 03:54:53'] he just needs to transfer some ownership over to Tesla then you'll have your Twitter inside Tesla and there's your ancillary Twitter play.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 13:16:11'] Need an update‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 14:34:00'] I gotta say two things:1) I admire your outlook and thank you for sharing this with this sub.  I felt awful for you because of reason number two..2) During the meme stock fervor I bought calls whose value overnight was about + 425k and I remember the feeling I had at night.  It wasn't happiness so much as an adrenaline fueled spike of possibilities, what I would do with that cash and how would I leverage it into more buying and what if it went up even more and I had millions!  The idea that it would dissappear by morning had me checking my app nonstop to look at AH action and watched futures all night and I remember thinking "this is too much" I didn't like the feeling, I mean obviously a ton of money is always nice but trading is too much for me.  I do 5k-10k options per week now to deal with it as I love the action but man oh man your post brought me right back to January 2021.  &#x200B;anyways man I wish you the best and hope you can repeat the success you almost made and even more !

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 09:44:33'] If you're still holding and didn't sell I am honestly hoping the stock ends up going another $20 because that will be a devastating loss that you didn't realize such a gain

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 16:27:40'] I‚Äôve seen people say on here something about if a stock closes above a (an unexpected high, like $250) strike price that shares have to be bought and that could continue a rally on Monday.if that is the case, Is this one of those situations where if TSLA closes above $250 it‚Äôs going to be like $275 on Monday? And ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù evil forces will be trying to make it drop to $249 at close Friday?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 05:25:20'] Bro this is your morning wake-up call to make sure to sell these before they decay away
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 16:33:20'] At one point it hit above $251, I guess he was creaming in his dreaming, but ended up getting the rear reaming..... Good ole' RobbinYaHood
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 18:32:13'] TSLA will close between $225 and $230 tomorrow. Look at the 5 Day Chart. Everybody will cash out after a good week as traders are becoming more anxious that the FED isn't done with tightening. Now 25% of wallstret participants expect another rate hike next wednesday vs. 21% in the last survey from monday morning. Don't be a fool and cash out sometimes in the moring.And about the supercharger thing: for me it's a sign of weakness, they have to look for other ways of income as car deliveries slow down. For Tesla owners it sure would be better if they wouldn't open the supercargers as more users ultimately result in longer waits

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 10:34:28'] Maybe Tesla is overvalued? Just a thought.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 09:51:53'] Easier that then admitting it may be the consequences of the twitter fiasco.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 11:57:07'] Panic selling will start at 140.00. Puts will cash in hard.  FUCK yeah.  I keep scalping more contracts each day and hitting the to ATM.  Only to resell 6 bucks lower.  Glorious, glorious profits.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:05:18'] People think Elon is some sort of God. He has had a few good ideas but a ton of bad ones..... like the boring tunnel. Billionaires are not your friends, billionaires are not going to save you. He didn't even found Tesla, he had to sue to be called a founder.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:09:00'] There is no one to blame honestly. You‚Äôre telling me that a car company (Tesla mkt cap) is worth more than all car companies in the world combined? Yea Um no.. it was highly over valued.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 10:30:27'] The only reason Tesla stayed afloat in the first play were the historically low interest rates since 2008-2009.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 09:56:59'] To be fair, not even close to all of it is due to Twitter. A lot is due to TSLA being overvalued and the economy
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:03:01'] Rate hikes will often do that to tech companies that sell consumer goods trading at high PEs. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 11:03:46'] Except Tesla board of directors says Elon hasn‚Äôt shown up to work once since he bought Twitter. And he‚Äôs tarnished their brand by being the woke meme edge lord he‚Äôs trying to be to appeal to the kids since his old saggy ass isn‚Äôt relevant anymore. Calls on GM and every other EV producer now. PUTS on tsla and twitter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 11:27:05'] More proof this guy is an idiot. I would blame it on him trying to turn twitter into truth social.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 18:01:26'] Tesla‚Äôs board has a lot to answer to. Tesla does not have a PR/marketing division so by default it is Elon. With him being the subject of all this concern, then the board is next in line to say something. There are clear perceptions, if not actually, conflicts on interest here. One concern is with Elon using/moving Tesla engineers to work on Twitter issues. Has, or is, Tesla being compensated for that? Where‚Äôs the board and where‚Äôs the accountability? Remember, Twitter is a  private venture - all profits/losses go to him
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 10:54:30'] Can we stop with this Idol worship already?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:21:54'] Classic musk. Needs government handouts to generate profits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 10:21:12'] So he's saying that his stock was massively overvalued and the moment people stopped speculatively investing it fell back towards reality?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 11:35:26'] Such a punk Republican excuse
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 11:41:50'] Gary Black clapped back at him on Twitter with some reasonable responses. I'd suggest giving his Twitter feed a looksee.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:04:11'] There was a time when Elon Musk was a brilliant innovator.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:27:12'] Hey Elon, wanna help with rising inflation?  Pay fucking taxes like everyone else. Not just as a publicity stunt every so often. Get all your other billionaire friends to as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:29:37'] He‚Äôs right, but the only reason it ever reached such overvalued heights in the first place was due to the fed as well. With rock bottom interest rates and injecting money into the economy.  That combined with short squeezes and some financial engineering on their earnings reports. Now things are just returning to normal. Tesla‚Äôs valuation has always been insane. It‚Äôs time it came back to reality. I‚Äôve been making money buying puts on it for months now and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Fuck that guy and fuck that company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:34:57'] Oh really? So you are saying the only reason your company was so overpriced was because of extremely cheap money? LMAO
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:41:45'] When you're playing around on Twitter all day it's probably a bit hard to focus on the other businesses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:57:01'] I‚Äôm sure his idiotic shenanigans over at Twitter had absolutely nothing to do with it‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 15:23:18'] Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 15:49:17'] Did he praise the Fed for causing TSLA and other tech stocks to go parabolic since March of 2020?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 16:08:16'] He‚Äôs mouth and tweets have nothing to do with the decline
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 18:43:22']  Musk owns 423.6 million shares of [\#TESLA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TESLA?src=hashtag_click).  At the 52-week high that was worth $171 Billion.  It is now worth $58 Billion.  So the cost of the Twitter acquisition is arguably $156 BILLION.  The market capitalization of Ford, GM and Mercedes is $166 Billion. So Musk has spent $155 Billion (most of this decline is a result of the decline in the Tesla brand, which is Musk) to post anti-vaxer conspiracy theories.It's a bold strategy, cotton.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:31:41'] If Nixon and Regan didnt fucked up, stock appeal would have still be linked to what the company do. Not magic.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 18:14:35'] He‚Äôs right. Growth stock P/E ratios are largely determined by the risk-free interest rates.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:20:49'] He‚Äôs not wrong
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 10:56:53'] How much tesla will Elno have to sell to keep the bird alive? When does he say fackit or will he be forced to sell tesla stock by othrr investor etc? I dont know how this works. Whos got the juice?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 11:09:03'] What a joke. Can‚Äôt he see that it‚Äôs tweeting his politics and attacking people and entities publicly that has knocked back Tesla. Seriously ,though.  My god I was sucked in by him. I may of lost 1400 $ in Tesla but I guess it‚Äôs what I had to pay to be entertained by this guy and his situations. He knows no bounds with his money sucking. He just started promoting his Tesla coin. Lol lol. He‚Äôs trolling for more suckers !

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:22:28'] In all fairness, it's also making an already expensive car even more ridiculously expensive with higher rates, that's a more accurate reason imo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:25:50'] To be fair, non sarcastic, he did say that Tesla was overvalued at one point‚Ä¶ and he does have a point, we‚Äôre starting to reach a point of over correction for Tesla stock‚Ä¶ get ready to by the dip in the coming years probably (this recession shit looks pretty gloomy rn).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 15:18:07'] Lol. Granted there is *some* validity there as most bubble stocks have taken similar, if not larger, hits. In reality, It‚Äôs 100% been driven by his selling and actions at Twitter though. The difference between a company with basically 0 debt, that‚Äôs growing at 50%, and makes buckets of cash and the shit it‚Äôs being compared to is enormous. Unlike PTON, Z, NKLA, etc., Tesla isn‚Äôt at risk of bankruptcy. They‚Äôve also got massive subsidies kicking in like 1.5 weeks. If Elon would stop having his anti-woke victim mentality it would help immensely‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 15:27:29'] Elon decides to keep digging I see.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 16:31:32'] Now that they public has seen behind the curtain and realized The Great Tech Wizard of Oz is a blithering idiot, Tesla is going to free fall back to a reasonable value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 16:35:35'] When Tesla was worth more than all the other major car companies combined‚Ä¶you knew it was a good short, wish I had. Apparently Elon was upset that Bill Gates was shorting Teslla ‚Ä¶good call Mr. Gates‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 16:53:38'] "For example, if T-bills and stocks both had a 10% rate of return, everyone would just buy the former."pretty sure no one who bought Tesla did so with hopes of a measly 10% CAGR. They all told themselves it would 100x every year till they retired.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 18:49:51'] That probably means all the stock price appreciation was due to 10+ years of 0% interest rates rather than management, too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 18:52:06'] Never heard from him talking about feds low interest rate last year

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 19:47:50'] Sounds right üôÑ
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 19:49:56'] Could it be because the people that he has turned on are (were) the people that were buying his cars? I wouldn‚Äôt own a Tesla now. No Way.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 20:00:15'] whatta dorkkkkk, possibly not the absolute dogshit company he purchased with TESLA share money?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 20:00:15'] TSLA has always been overvalued. It‚Äôs not a car manufacturer, it‚Äôs a carbon credit issuer, that‚Äôs their main income, not from cars.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 23:52:31'] Stock market was too hot, probably unpopular but Tesla seemed unreasonably highly priced. Unclear if rising rates will directly impact Tesla sales. Automotive slowdown likely helps Tesla extend EV lead in the long term.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 01:34:27'] Elon is such a whiny bitch. It's like listening to a toddler explaining why nothing is their fault. They federal government subsidising Tesla was a huge part of their success, but Elon will claim all success for himself and all failures are someone else's fault.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 02:54:46'] Maybe being valued more than all other auto makers put together while only producing around 0.01% of all cars explains it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:20:02'] >Kinda surprisingly here is the fact that the VIX did not spike when we had that massive EOD sell off. It id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema‚Ä¶ but with a sell off of that size I would have expected more bounce there. That could come tomorrow though. One thing I did note that besides Friday the PC ratio is very low this week on Spy.I believe VIX didn't spike because the EOD sell-off was actually EOM pension rebalancing. Especially due to this months underperformance leading to a EOM sell. Therefore it was actual selling of shares, rather than the put hedge buying lately which has driven VIX up. Calm, systematic rebalancing.Equities outperformed bonds this month, so EOM rebalancing saw funds dumping stock and buying bonds, pushing yields down and TLT up by end of day, with SPY down. Was one big trade.Vanna and charm flows return tomorrow, so more VIX crush can be expected going forward, especially with no more news til CPI 2 weeks from now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 16:37:45'] It's crazy how Meta went up just because they said they're creating an AI product group. At least NVDA can point to datacenter sales and have a physical product on the market (though we'll get to them on a second). I'm surprised Meta didn't drop during the day since the announcement feels like a nothing burger. No insight into how that will drive revenue from them just jumping on the AI hype train. I want to say they should fall back below 170 once people have had more time to digest it, but at the same time I don't understand how they pumped in the first place (from a rational perspective) so what do I know.As everyone said, good thing you held off on those puts yesterday.&#x200B;And now we see NVDA is doing an offering; any insight into what their motivation is? Do they recognize their PE is absurdly high and figured they might as well cash in on it? Or do they actually see a need for extra cash reserves? Going to be interesting seeing if this is what finally causes their valuation to drop and if so by how much. I see they broke 130 in after hours, I'm thinking they wont retake that in the morning.

I think numbers come in hot again and the Fed will be forced to go back to .50 because they clearly said they will do what is needed. I‚Äôm guessing we will be typing away here at the end of March with Spy around 380 though. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see March down 5-7%. Pray nothing happens with China and Taiwan. If it does, buckle up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 13:54:01'] Even with CPI coming in hot, 50bps is not happening. Fed won't adjust their current plan and lose credibility. They have to let everyone think that Fed knows what they are doing. Going 50bps would mean they had no plan. Just shooting in the dark and hoping it would work.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 07:28:35'] Congratulations on being todays big idiot.You have two options.You let them go and you will sell your 200 shares of Tesla for $197 and keep whatever option premium you got. (You lose nothing)You buy back the contracts and lose whatever your down on the options but you get to keep your shares.This has been ‚Äúi have no idea what the fuck i‚Äôm doing trading options‚Äù with OSRSkarma
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 07:45:15'] Ok so piecing together your comments, here's where I think you're at.You own 200 shares of Tesla that you bought at approx. $160/share, for an initial total debit of $32,000.You used those shares as collateral to sell two $197.5 calls, collecting some premium. I don't know how much premium you collected, depends on when you sold them. Maybe $8 per share per contract? That would be a credit of $1,600.Tesla rose to $210 so now the calls you sold are (a) ITM and (b) worth $15.65 per share per contract, which is more than when you sold them.You have two options:1. Buy back the options you sold. You will pay $3,130, the contracts will be gone, and you'll keep your 200 Tesla shares. This is a good idea if your investment thesis has changed and you think Tesla is going to the moon and you want to take the loss on the options now to keep your shares long-term.2. Let the options expire ITM tomorrow. You will be assigned on the calls, and have to sell your 200 Tesla shares at $197.5, collecting $39,500. Even though that's below the going market price for TSLA, it's above what you paid for the shares, so you will make a total profit, cradle to grave, on your TSLA shares of $39,500 - $32,000 + (whatever credit you received for selling the two options) = min. $7,500. But your shares of TSLA will be gone. This is a good idea if you want to bank some cash immediately and don't want to invest in TSLA for the long term.Edit: My advice is since you clearly don't know what the hell you're doing, just do nothing and let the options expire tomorrow evening. You'll walk way with at least $7,500 more than you had when you started, and maybe next time you'll learn what options are before you sell them.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 07:39:45'] If I was you and bought my 200 Tesla shares around 160 once the contract expires I‚Äôd have to sell my shares for $197.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 09:31:59'] First of all, there no "losses" to speak of.  You paid < $197/share initially.  You also collected premium when selling the calls.If everything stays the same and the options get exercised, you wouldn't realize the same PROFIT as if you just sold the shares; however, you are profiting.What you do next is up to you: - NOTHING : Accept your profit and move on.  - Close options.  Pay the current value of options and keep your shares.  This will eat up your cash but you'll keep your shares.- "Roll" the options - This is nothing more than vlosing your current options and opening new ones at a later date/different strike price, hopefully to end up with a net credi and to get the strike price above where you think SP will be.Which one you choose comes down to you.  If you are long, rolling probably what makes sense. FWIW.-

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 08:07:01'] You can roll them to a higher strike and later expiration.  Up & out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 11:04:02'] Okay OP listen up, to make things simple. You bought 200 shares at a price of 165 and then you sold two calls at 197. This means that if the stock price goes above the call price that you sold your calls at, in your case if the stock goes above 197, by the expiration date then you HAVE to sell your 200 shares at the price of 197 which is where you sold your calls at. So you bought 200 shares at 165 and you have to sell them at 197. You make profit however it‚Äôs capped at a maximum of 197 which is where you sold your covered calls. You ‚Äúcovered‚Äù your shares by selling calls at 197. Even though the stock is above 197 you only get the profit from the difference from your buy point (167) and your sell point (197).  You still make profit and you collected the premium from selling the calls initially. The only thing you missed out on is additional profit. If you didn‚Äôt sell the calls you wouldn‚Äôt be capped at 197. However you couldn‚Äôt predict what the price would be. Selling the covered calls is a tool to reduce risk. If the price didn‚Äôt jump you would‚Äôve collected the premium and kept the shares. But you covered your shares. And you gained a profit of 200 shares x (197 (your covered call strike price) -  165 (your initial buy point) ). Now even if the stock  were to double tomorrow, you‚Äôd still only make a profit of 200 shares x (197-165). But you‚Äôd still make a profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 07:35:16'] So many brain dead people preach selling covered calls as free, easy money.  It's fucking not.  If it's a run-away winner, it gets called away, and you get stuck with all the losses (minus the premium) if it falls.  It's easy to say you would be happy to sell at $197 when the stock is at $180, not so much when it rises to $210 within a few days.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 07:36:53'] This is why I only buy calls and puts at this point. Selling is a whole other beast that carries with it much more risk. You have to understand it or you could lose a shit ton of money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 16:31:40'] Boo hoo. The guy could have offered $54 a share, but no, he couldn't help himself, he had to offer fifty-420 for the joke, costing him an extra \~$150M.  Life saving fuck off.

Your pain is faux the real pain is of those you have purposely hurt by your actions & words.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 04:17:53'] Yes running a company is going to be hard when you saddle it with a ton of dept, fire most of the staff, and piss off the rest by shit talking them, before you even set foot in the office.Big brain move there Mr Genius ü§£Can't believe this clown fooled so many into thinking he was a genius.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 01:44:27'] You did this to yourself.    Nobody forced you to offer to buy a loss-making tech company at 25% above the then-current price during an economic downturn that you had "super bad feelings" about earlier.  You have ruined your reputation as a clever businessman.  You have wrecked the lives of many of your investors who have been forced out of their positions.  You have exposed Tesla and SpaceX to a potential loss of engineering talent.  You are actively hostile to *at least* 50% of your potential customer base.  You have dragged your investors into a company that many, if not most, had no interest in investing in. You change your mind so often that even the cult no longer believes anything you say.  You are spiraling down the Q rabbit-hole.  You did this to yourself.  Sell enough Tesla shares to pay off the debt you forced on Twitter for the acquisition, find a buyer at whatever price, and walk away.  Take the L and try to rebuild.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 16:46:44'] Ahhh poor Elon Muskrat...there are people selling their fucking ass for $5 on the corner..But yes tough life for the Muskrat
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 17:39:31'] I wonder if Musk would dump Twitter for 15 billion, basically all the debt? Would someone like $Googl (ad synergy) buy it on the cheap and would the FTC look the other way just to end this clown show?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 17:53:58'] He could have gave us a stimmy
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 16:22:06'] Maybe he should follow what the people voted on yesterday (like he said he would) and step down from Twitter.The people voted... they want him to leave.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 17:13:13'] Karma!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 23:52:19'] let that sink in
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 02:41:57'] Puts on Tesla indeed
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 06:17:21'] Elon buying twitter is a running joke in my family now. I complained to my gf about cost of lettuce we paid, and she replied well at least we didn't pay 40 billion for twitter.   Stupid purchase of the century.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 04:13:32'] The man who owns Tesla sure does create a compelling argument to not use Twitter
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 07:33:05'] Man......I feel for him. I remember when my life savings was in the billions and I was spending so much money because of my ego. Wait......what's a life savings????
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:20:10'] All this because Elizabeth Warren called him out a couple of times.  If all it takes is challenging a billionaire in a way that shows how fragile their ego is, this can now happen more often.To be fair, I don't think politicians should pick on private citizens, even if they're billionaires.  Billionaires deserve a bunch of credit for driving their companies, if they benefit society.  But companies should also be owned by more people rather than less.  Twitter fiasco is showing how important good workers are....Tesla and SpaceX likely "managed the manager" with Musk for years, and he reaped those benefits.  Worker compensation not going up despite massive productivity increases is terrible, but that's a policy question that doesn't need to involve picking on people just working within the current system.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:35:24'] Haven‚Äôt heard any complaining
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:45:21'] So guessing he wants to make Twitter public again and put it back on the stock market ü§î

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 00:17:16'] Elon, plz drain TSLA's wealth
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 00:42:12'] well, well, who'd have thought?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 02:30:18'] Goodbye my calls. Why is my timing always bad?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 03:15:18'] So why did he buy Twitter? Admitting lack of due diligence?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 06:51:59'] Can he buy puts on his own company?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 06:58:25'] The first sentence of the article mind bogglingly bad: ‚ÄúAfter asking his followers if he should step down as Twitter‚Äôs CEO, Elon Musk heard from a volunteer for his job that was admittedly a joke.‚ÄùSorry what?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 07:28:25'] Poor fella, maybe he should just give it all up. Take up a hobby like gardening, or painting.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:15:53'] I hope it bankrupts him. A hero turned into a villain. He knew he was screwed when he couldn‚Äôt back out of the deal, and all the numbers came in. Now he‚Äôs losing his mind publicly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:18:13'] To be fair, he certainly should never have been in the position to be this rich.Tesla is just one of the biggest bubble it ever existed, he hasn‚Äôt really made anything worth the money he got.Twitter is certainly more than what he should have been able to acquire.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:26:27'] I've been buying puts on TSLA for like 2 weeks now. Highly recommend.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:36:04'] Poor baby‚Ä¶.Don‚Äôt let this fuckhole deceive you, the bankruptcy play is strong here. He spent other people‚Äôs money on Twitter. He‚Äôll leverage this into a way to not pay taxes on any Tesla income‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 12:41:16'] I think the time to short tesla has already come and went.  I don't like Elon but I think we see a  bounce so I'm holding off on shorting tsla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:36:25'] Wrong hole compilations start now with Elon buying Twitter
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:57:39'] He‚Äôs schizophrenic I‚Äôve come to realize. He literally says one thing and does an extreme other. He shitposts all day and seeks approval by posting meaningless polls. Made a bad purchase too bad, go suck more Republican D and get your money back up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 11:38:09'] You see, total transparency & honesty. Those who shall not be mentioned could learn again from this man.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:48:24'] I like the idea of giving twitter blue holders control of content decisions and moderation.  You buy the right to vote on major decisions.  Then the backlash is at the vote and electorate, just like American politics.The parties can get on and pitch their platforms too.  Research so to speak on what sells and doesn‚Äôt.  Twitter blue verification process and costs should make polls less susceptible to bots and get as close to one vote as possible with a social media platform I suppose.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 17:35:46'] Lol well at least he got to cash out on trasla shares while avoid a 40bn tax bill while still own twatter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 22:51:57'] Puts on your mom
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 03:02:50'] Well, he can f*** all the banks up, implementing BTC as payment on Twitter putting a a good CEO on charge, with  a big consequences of raising prices of tesla stock to a whole new level and of course on bitcoin‚Ä¶ ( Cathie wood make a big shopping Christmas presents these past days,on Tesla  also on Coinbase) I believe expecting that‚Äôs these movement can happen.Elon has the power, of controlling the markets and prices of things as he pleasures.

I do think we are setting up for a more hawkish tone come next FOMC depending on what march CPI brings biggest takes for me is that some members would have voted for 50bps and the tight job market could cause higher and prolonged inflation\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4yz1ge3yitja1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=37b8fee1341105fb1c5d9d491347b2ab2800543e\n\nSomething I find VERY interesting is that this is apparently the most dovish minutes in 2 years YET the VIX did not sell off post minutes and spy DID sell o'

NVDA is on SPY and QQQ etfs and with NVDA strong earnings I expect a rise to perhaps nvda 228-230 and then back to our general downtrend.  i may also short nvda shares at that point.  nvda 230 will be a good opportunity to add to my SPY Puts! I will probably base my entry on NVDA hitting around RSI 80 on the 5m or other technical indicators.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 16:06:19'] Thanks for the info. Your key resistances have really helped me pick my entries and exits much better, made some good money off that 401 rejection today.

POST_TEXT: b'My son and I have been on hold for up to 45 minutes trying to locate inventory for a basic entry-level White Tesla Model 3. Demand is simply off the charts and he might have to fly to a different state to take delivery and qualify for the $7500 tax break before March 18, 2023. Or settle for a more expensive version that is available at his closest Tesla showroom. I just bought the stock.'

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 12:08:14'] LMAO. There is *no* demand - that's why there have been *five* price cuts so far this year. You are trying to buy a vehicle that doesn't exist in the real world.  The \*base\* model Tesla 3 is  just a scam so they can claim a totally BS starting price. You will have *zero* trouble finding more expensive cars.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 15:41:59'] On hold for 45 minutes is definitely not because Tesla has the worst customer service in the industry. Garbage cars and garbage service
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 07:35:57'] First quarter delivery numbers suggest otherwise. Tesla is selling expensive electric cars in a high interest rate, possibly recessionary environment. I don't expect Tesla sales to stop growing, I just see the price cuts as helping to keep growth on track.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 02:24:30'] You are trying to find a model 3 on the lot ready to sell. That means if you found one then it implies that they have more supply than demand which probably means demand is NOT off the charts Customer service wait time could be due to a number of things. Like the fact that most companies don‚Äôt hire enough customer service agents because it‚Äôs just a cost center.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 16:00:24'] Demand will only be high until April 18th...then the tax credit gets reduced and we'll get to see whether that demand was sustainable.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 17:32:24'] this guy has never heard of sales tactics clearly... every dealership has done this the past 3 years since covid lol...
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 19:08:38'] Ok, so for those of you asking about time travel... I think they mean it was purchased before march, but to prevent the tax break dropping from 7500 to 3750 on april 18, they have to fly to another state to take ownership.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 05:40:10'] Manufacturer that focuses on higher trims to keep profits up. And you are trying to find an entry level car. Lol.  My market is absolutely saturated with Tesla.  And I've never seen a base model.  Everything is dual motor minimum.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 14:01:47'] I hate Tesla it is unbelievably overvaluedBut I do think a good 20% rally is due. Wouldn't be surprised to see 230-240
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-15 14:35:35'] You had to wait 45 minutes because they have 5 agents at the call center.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 10:12:56'] Is that because of demand, or because Tesla has supply bottlenecks? Is this recent price cut the last, or should you and your son wait for the next price cut?

Shares of Tesla are up about 3% this year, ending Thursdays session at $127.17.\n\nElon Musks company has experienced a slew of bad news as of late.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 01:38:24'] TSLA's current market cap is $400B.Cathie's autonomous bull case puts it at 13x that, which is a whooping $5.2T. in 5 years. Companies can have insane valuations. But maybe a valuation that's close to 25 % of USA's GDP is a little regarded. It would also be 1/6th of $SPY's current Market cap. Which would be insane ! The gain porn that this play would create would be legendary. Side note : I fully support Cathie's right to YOLO. Some get a hold of her and ask her to post her gain / Loss porn. If any ARKK employees are lurking here - dudes / dudettes , you might create a legend, or a devastation of capital that might rival Bill Huang.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 11:55:51'] She's highly regarded
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 10:48:54'] I got into Tesla in 2012 and got out around 2017 because it was clear that they were embellishing the self driving capabilities. At that time all of the Tesla bulls including Morgan Stanley and Cathie Woods were hyping the FSD capability and robotaxis and using it in their financial models. Now FSD for Tesla is no longer a potential asset but a potential liability, given the fact that they've sold so many vehicles as FSD capable without having any path to getting regulatory approval.That's my biggest issue with Tesla management and the people that hype the stock, why can't they acknowledge reality and admit that they were wrong about FSD? Instead they're changing their story and ignoring the promises that were made.

POST_TEXT: b'Looking at this article from Bespoke you can see that incredibly of the last 13 trading days only one of those closed below its open that means despite how red we opened or how green we opened we closed above our open. IT just shows the incredible strength and memeness of this rally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp0lndi4uuga1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=563e5ed1655a594812eb1aa41917ec025f718279\n\nI thought I had seen it all and then we have SPY who managed to pump nearly $7 drop $8 and then proceed to repump nearly $9 all within a 4 hour time period. This was the most wild amount of swinging I have seen in a very long time. This was like a FOMC meeting mixed with CPI on steroids. \n\nSo the question remains who is in control? Where are we headed next? Unfortunately the answer is not simple and there truthfully is a case for >420 and there is a case for <405.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 16:10:03'] imo seeing TSLA struggle so much to keep up with SPY today really showed me we very much could be seeing that short term top. picked up a TSLA put eod good luck everyone.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 16:26:19'] Had a great day, played a 408/412 strangle and managed to sell the calls at the initial top securing profit and closed the puts on the way down. Could‚Äôve made even more if I had waited another 10 minutes to sell the puts when we hit 408 but can‚Äôt complain about a 45% profit play. Eyeing TSLA puts tomorrow depending on how we look strength wise. If we stall out in this 415-417 area on SPY will look to open a 9-16DTE TSLA put position since I feel the only thing keeping TSLA from drilling again is that SPY is showing this insane regard strength and keeping the market afloat through bearish after bearish news
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 18:04:41'] Honestly I‚Äôm glad i ran out of buying power in the morning and just did a scratch trade, thus I was just watching the action sitting on my hands just looking at the madness unfold in front of me. Definitely didn‚Äôt expect this amount of volatility!

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 20:54:07'] Good to see your content. I lost big after pump with Microsoft miss, amd and top it off with aapl, goog and amzn. This momentum is rock hard and agree 100% that a shock down and bump up is perfect setting. Not sure when that happens.Btw, ChatGPT predicted Feb15 for next leg down.. lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 16:55:38'] Your advise is why I held off on TSLA weekly puts, but I might dig in if it looks like it could start sliding. As always, great DD.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 17:43:43'] Today was great. Grabbed one 0dte SPX put shortly after the first spike, continued increasing my stop loss most of the way down until it kicked me out. After the double formed I waited a little bit for confirmation and then grabbed one SPX 0dte call and rode it all the way up till my stop loss kicked me out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 20:46:15'] So, in conclusion... we gonna consolidate until next major catalyst? Too many unknown, how many funds are willing to buy at market top, if 420-430 is the top that is. Powell reiterated today they are going to raise more if data doesnt come out nice. Therefore if we get a single miss on the cpi, we gonna dump hard. Again, hard to bet on it, chance of happening pretty slim. Next one could be interesting...
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 06:05:26'] Hey Dersch I was wondering what you think of Nvda? Where resistance or good time to try some puts. It seems ridiculous right now. I know you mainly spy/TSLA so no worries if you‚Äôre busy. Thanks!

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 17:35:55'] I think you have to account for the hot topic right now: AI.  MSFT and NVDA have shown stupid strength, especially through the mid-day chop today.  Until this trend cools off, its going to be difficult to correct with two big dogs like that just running.  I could easily see NVDA having a blow off top 8%ish move tomorrow with how it behaved today and how post market looks.  Just wild shit lately.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 22:40:54'] As always, I appreciate your posts! I‚Äôll be honest; I bought a $108p 2/8exp because we briefly broke the $108.80 barrier based on your TA and obviously am regretting it. Not your fault though, it was a pretty wild swing back in the other direction I don‚Äôt think many saw coming.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:37:53'] There's obviously too much liquidity or a force that prevents any downside from gaining traction. Been this way all year. There is not a single dip that can be sustained. Everything turns into a V. Market looks like it needs a breather here to at least fill the gap and reset, but it's not allowed to drop. It's truly mind-blowing how insanely difficult it is to get the market to have even this most basic pullback in '23.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 04:48:21']  Bob Farrell's rule**9. When all the experts and forecasts agree ‚Äì something else is going to happen.** *Translation:* This rule fits with Farrell's contrarian streak.  When all analysts have a buy rating on a stock, there is only one way  left to go (downgrade). Excessive bullish sentiment from newsletter  writers and analysts should be viewed as a warning sign. Investors  should consider buying when stocks are unloved and the news is all bad.  Conversely, investors should consider selling when stocks are the talk  of the town and the news is all good. Such a contrarian investment  strategy usually rewards patient investors.

There's no other outcome. Most politicians are too stupid to write a different bill. Hell, I'd be impressed if any of them actually read the current bill. The people that really matter are the economics experts they hire as staffers, and they've already sorted this all out. This vote is the equivalent of a conference call where you're silent the whole time and then you realize it's about to end so you need to pipe up and say something at the last second so you let folks know you're involved and can take part of the credit.

POST_TEXT: b'Well after yet another day of high volatility, high IV and range bound movement ($3.31 total movement intraday) we are yet again still seeing sell the rip happen here in the market. Will this continue or will we see an upside push? \n\nOne interesting thing to note now is that SPY and Futures are both officially in extreme bear momentum. Which means that we are going to need a bigger and more aggressive bounce in order to see a reversal upside. We would need to close over the daily 20ema and continue upward after that to convinced me of an upside reversal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4rxy43puh7la1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4168786563e1a067dbad4a60bc58a5c929a16fa\n\nTaking a look at the daily chart here you can see we have that nice 396.36 supply level that we established on Friday. With that being established we then broke out over it tested demand and rejected it at 400.6 and then came back down and now we are closing back under supply. This is very bearish '

If there's supply at  207 and 214 then that means there's a lot of people willing to sell at that price and supply the people who wish to enter holding the stock. If there's demand at 196 then that means there's a large demand for people wanting to buy it at that price because its a fair entry price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 16:48:00'] How did TSLA do the day after the last investor day?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 18:20:04'] TSLA investor day was a snooze fest. i was waiting for them to announce a new model and bought 100 shares around 198.6. sold half at 197 and was shocked to see it at 189 at AH close!The youtube chat kept it entertaining, lol.  I dont want to baghold TSLA and with that lame event surely people will probably be dumping. so i might dump my other 50 and switch to shorting instead. Never have luck with TSLA it seems...I've been doing well with 3/17 395 puts and SQQQ calls, buying on tops of upswings and peicemeal selling them for 80-100 dollar gains slowly. With todays close and TSLA sucking really hard I expect us to open lower tomorrow to start. SPY dropped a buck and a half probably since 4:15PM probably soley from the TSLA event.I still have a fuckton of calls at the moment including XOM, MCD, HRL, DAL, PSA, MDLZ. Probably around 25k worth of calls and they are all red at the moment. Mostly june dated. planning to exit if we get back to 4000, if not might need to exit many of those. My SPY puts and SQQQ have been offsetting those losses but i'm getting low on buying power.Looking to re-enter UNG at 8.5 if it gets there, made decent coin on UNG calls too this week.I have had a good run since mid jan of about 33k realized gains and my account is up 55% YTD....but being so heavy with calls and definitely bearish looking charts I'm not feeling so great.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 15:19:23'] Turned bullish today (dont really want to) but we are having a lot of trouble breaking the 200ma plus we have a reversal doji today with vix having a lot of trouble moving up as well as bullish convergences happening on the daily.All the news lately is just piling on more inflation news, but the market has just no volume and momentum to move down. I'd really like to see us close under the 200.I'm definitely confused by its strength lately. Now that Ive switched sides, you'll probably be right haha and we'll finally dump.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 18:43:35'] Not sure how this is bullish long term. Tesla's one differentiator is their large charging network. If any car can charge at their station that means any electric car will do for people which means less car sales for tesla

Based on the data I could beat, be unchanged or miss from previous. \n\nFor me and I might be wrong I think markets are going to focus negatively on this MoM rebound and this will be the first CPI YoY that does not decrease by atleast 0.7% since November.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo0io1f9w0ia1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b33507b2ea3be128bb910aae3773071b4e90f8f\n\nSome very interesting things about this pre-CPI day this is the highest the fear and greed index has been on the day before CPI all year long. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://pr'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 16:11:22'] Market has priced in favorable CPI for next 10 months Lolol
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 14:41:06'] You are correct, inflation heating back up again is what will cause markets to break down. New car pricing is still out of control. An average F-series pickup is $67,000. With prime at 7.75%, I don't know who is underwriting these big ticket purchases.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 13:55:39'] Those full $1 jumps today on SPY drove me insane.\~$409.30 to \~$410.50, \~$410.80 to $411.8, \~$411.15 to $412.2. Each essentially in a matter of seconds, and like you I expected each to be "it", with a selloff ensuing shortly after.All while macro indicators pointed to a *slight* short-term pop if anything. For this to happen while the 10y-2y inverted pretty aggressively deeper though is absurd to me.Oh well, didn't bet the farm but also deep in the red today.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 14:13:32'] It‚Äôs crazy to me that players aren‚Äôt buying more downside protection given all the uncertainties with this report. Prices definitely increased across the board in January and the entire ‚Äúdisinflation‚Äù thesis is hanging on this print.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 14:38:56'] Stayed out of the market today and when I checked the theta/prems on 1DTE-9DTEs EOD I thought it wasn‚Äôt worth trying to play a straddle/strangle and am staying cash. Have a gut feeling that tomorrow will be a trend day so going to see where we are at market open and play from there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 13:23:01'] >I do not agree with your assessment that a higher than expected CPI will not stop this bull run. I believe that if we see a hotter than expected CPI, the market will correct significantly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 13:47:11'] So far every bullish scenario you've called has come true.. none of the bear scenarios have played out even with most of the proper conditions. This time it's different I hope but I know I'll wake up, put on my ü§° makeup and get ready for that 3% day
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 16:47:46'] Can anyone remember when was the last time the market had 2 consecutive red days that actually held? What about a single red day that wasn't completely wiped out the following next day and then some? It just blows my mind JPOW said he doesn't see the markets acting irrationally.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 17:02:20'] The Fed leaker Nick Timiraos tweeted something bearish stuff too
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 15:54:57'] Everything is pointing to a good CPI tomorrow, even if we do meet the expectations or even beat it by a little, market wont be up alot since everything is priced in. If we end up green tomorrow, i think its gonna be like a +0.3% day. However if CPI misses then its gonna be a good red day. Puts are actually the better risk/reward play here. Got some lottos puts just incase for tmr.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 15:55:35'] So OP's sentiment is: mkt to continue up

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 20:10:53'] Well said. The bid was present and persistent yet again today. Not too bad for a down day, at least you limited your trading. Again, I‚Äôm hoping we get that last big shot in the arm tomorrow because I‚Äôd love to put on some swings short near 4300. Until then I‚Äôm trading whatever comes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 20:38:05'] theres an argument for both sides here, inflation for the past 6 month cooled so much that there‚Äôs definitely a case for 2% yoy by SeptemberThis report will be too critical, and for that I‚Äôm sitting out

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 18:52:17'] you predicted this pretty much spot on. tomorrow will be a wild card most certainly. seems like lately you've been talking yourself out of your convictions.i would like to know the strategy on how to play tomorrow considering the CPI data comes in at 830. futures will have time to price it in and then what happens at open? potential reversal because futures might react too hot proportion to the actual news?And trying to exit options positions at open will be nuts - tricky to get accurately valued bid/ask at open. don't make silly mistakes and utilize limit sells i guess, i once sold calls too soon at open and it had a lame lowball bid --i lost about $1500 that way.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 07:21:28'] Written by ChatGPT   `Posting images of losing trades on WallStreetBets, or any other online trading forum, can be a valuable way to learn from your mistakes and improve your trading strategy. It can also help to create a sense of accountability and transparency in your trading journey.``One of the main benefits of sharing your losing trades is the opportunity to receive feedback and advice from other traders. By posting your mistakes and asking for help, you can gain valuable insights and perspective on what went wrong and how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. This can be especially helpful for newer traders who may not have as much experience or knowledge about the markets.``In addition to receiving feedback, sharing your losing trades can also serve as a reminder to stay humble and grounded in your trading. It's easy to get caught up in the excitement of making a winning trade, but it's important to remember that losing trades are an inevitable part of the trading process. By sharing your losses, you can help to keep yourself in check and avoid letting your ego get in the way of making sound trading decisions.``Another benefit of sharing your losing trades is the opportunity to build a community of supportive and like-minded traders. By being open and transparent about your mistakes, you can create a sense of camaraderie and support among your fellow traders. This can be especially helpful for traders who may feel isolated or unsupported in their trading journey.``Overall, sharing your losing trades on WallStreetBets or other online trading forums can be a valuable way to learn from your mistakes, stay humble, and build a supportive community of traders. It may not be easy to admit to your losses, but by doing so, you can set yourself up for long-term success in the markets.`

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. * Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. * I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. * The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.# FAQ - Because others have already asked.* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.* Are you entering all these plays?   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.* Where are the crayons? I only see words.    * Click the links above.* Have you back-tested this?   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)* What is the historical performance?   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 58% and 79%. (Stats as of 2022-12-31)

In the photos above, the pictured house did exactly that. South-side roofs were covered all over (44 solar panels), but let‚Äôs not leave out the north side either (20 solar panels, for a total of 64). A wild guess is that they generate at least 20 MWh/yr. (Estimate of 300W/panel.)

POST_TEXT: b'I just read a report that Goldman Sachs is predicting 300 millions jobs lost or degraded by AI. In my opinion, we will see nowhere near this number of jobs lost (if at all). Its amazing how over speculated the tech industry is now. NVDA rallying 20% just because they mention AI in their earnings call? AI is a giant marketing fad. Wall Street has become obsessed over its perceived exponential growth which will soon grind to a halt. You can only scale a model so much before you start to see diminishing returns. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has even stated that this is a huge problem and why a GPT 5 isnt being worked on at the moment. These LLMs also steal data and tend to hallucinate constantly. This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management. Once this is regulated and things come back down to Earth the business world is in for a huge awakening because tech is no where near as profitable'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 11:28:49'] 300M jobs lost is BS. Take computer programmers for example. They still need a Product Manager who owns the product strategy and proposes a new piece of software. They will need to work with someone who understands the capabilities of software and what is feasible and define the requirements. Then the programmer will most likely use AI to help create the code, but will still need to test and debug the software. Then multiple iterations of this loop as they get feedback from customers etc. I see AI making jobs more efficient and effective, not necessarily replacing a bunch of people. AI will help software become even more prolific. As more products become electronic and integrated with IOT, we probably need 10X the number of programmers that we have today which won't exist because the lack of population growth. AI will make this possible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 11:36:59'] I agree. Large language models look at large data sets and predict the most likely next word. They don‚Äôt insert blocks of data, like quotes. They don‚Äôt analyze them for validity. That‚Äôs where the hallucinations come into play. Inserting quotes and knowing the truth goes against the core concept. Fixing that problem at scale will be hard. They fix isn‚Äôt isn‚Äôt coming soon. The large language model is nice, but the true power is automation, not having a person in the middle to talk to it. People that are getting excited about the LLM are missing the point of automation.Most companies don‚Äôt have their data organized well enough for an AI to catalog at it. This will take years, if not decades. Jobs will change. We don‚Äôt do a massive shit ton of work due to capacity. People won‚Äôt be downsized. They‚Äôll just do more. Their jobs will change from what they are today. That‚Äôs ok. Data from Twitter and Reddit are over valued. Billions of unresearched, racist, low effort post and bots repeating talking points are ducking worthless to repeat and build an AI against. Tech investors are looking for their next get rich quick idea since crypto went bust. There really isn‚Äôt anything to invest in yet, so they‚Äôre trying to drive up the demand.

Sure, writers who need bland copy quickly and people who like AI generated art with the faces and hands all wrong are having some fun with it.  But AI is not very robust (yet), and it‚Äôs a long way from being autonomous and taking over all of society like Skynet did on August 29, 1997 at 2:14 am.But hey, everybody on Wall Street loves a good rumor that can blow stock values out of proportion so that some can ride the hype and get out before it dives.Once AI can make itself smarter, then we‚Äôll see it change everything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 12:05:53'] In my experience, I dont know, how far this will take us.  I can tell you in tech things are moving quite fast and costs are declining. Example, at one startup, we used to pay Cloudfare 30k/month to cache, protect and stabilize a high traffic website. Last time, I checked with their team, the bill was reduced to $300/month. Six years ago, at another startup, we published a podcast and we had a junior marketing guy who handled the audio files, upload it to all the platforms, create snippets for promotional purposes and handle the SEO for the podcast, it was pretty much his full time job. Now, you pay $50/month to a podcast platform and it does all that job and the junior marketing guys only spends a couple hours once every week promoting podcasts to increase the audience. This startup now has 3 podcasts. So, I can tell you things are moving and who knows whats coming in the next five years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 13:01:09'] Yeah, Nvidia simply mentioned AI on their earnings call.  Simpleton.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 12:36:27'] I'd say a good 90% of tech jobs and administrative middle-management jobs will be completely obsolete in 10 years. You people working at AppleGoogleFacebookMicrosoft as a "Project Manager" or "Logistics coordinator" or even a junior programmer have no idea how useless you are, relative to your wage and the global averages in income. Someone can easily do your job in India for far less, and now AI can do it for far less as well. Doesn't necessarily make YOU completely obsolete, it's just your job is obsolete and is not worth paying you $100k++ for something that requires very little knowledge and intelligence compared to say, someone grilling burgers for their food truck, or a lettuce farmer in Central California.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 11:32:26'] I think they are spot on. If you do a job involving an office or work from home and it involves a pc then odds are future AI will do that job better , faster , no health insurance , no pay , in smaller facilities, 24/7.Think of all the call centres there are and how most calls are going to be - based on my past experience when I was student - largely relatively simple and covered by FAQ on the web site. Wait times are cause by human interaction. AI = little to no wait time. Investment ? Eventually AI will be using data and sources far in excess of what a human could and using that to make decisions . It‚Äôll change the market as you‚Äôll probably see less emotional investing and reactionary swings , but likely a potential for far greater engineered pricing.Every time there is a big societal change it‚Äôs resisted and people are convinced that the old ways are never going to be gone. Bring on the downvotes but it‚Äôll happen in our lifetime if you are 50 or under. That‚Äôs why countries are starting to look at universal basic income, partly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 12:27:37'] Feel like everyone will have AI burnout in the next couple years because we will have to decipher between real and AI produced shit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 15:19:10'] Maybe it‚Äôs just me but I don‚Äôt anticipate chatgtp or open ai being the point or good examples for corporate use of AI. I think corporates will train their own/purchased AI‚Äôs based on data sets either owned by them our bought for purpose.. and there‚Äôll be plenty of benefits into having a corporate champ that can put together all the data and draw conclusions, graphs and forecasts all based on data the company owns. You know how many people put their minds together to analyze data and create micro services for management, sales reps and the like. There‚Äôs plenty of other use such as in-house training courses, AI assistants to new hires and seniors. Basically fuck searching through 10 000 pages of knowledge-bases and courses. AI can standardize, it can correct and it can easily apply corporate governance. It can analyze performance based on metric data from Microsoft Viva, phone calls and sales etc. I guess my point is the data is already accessible and some poor soul probably goes through this shit on monthly reports showing KPI‚Äôs and sales performances etc.. but why not have one corporate AI that just swings this all the time and constantly keep track, give feedback, proposals etc. Then I think there will be companies manufacturing employee AI‚Äôs, basically training them for a specific role, could be a nurse, could be an IT operations person, could be a support agent, or any type of service job really. Now incorporate a bit of PAM & IAM for regulation purposes and to give the AI ways of executing tasks. It has the knowledge, it has the access to a variety of commands it can execute, it has the possibility to have a dialogue and troubleshoot, why wouldn‚Äôt it work? These little humanlike service AI‚Äôs will then be sold to companies, managed, trained and improved by its original makers. AI is also going to become a part of people‚Äôs everyday life‚Äôs, like it or not with smart homes, alarm systems, personal assistants.. you either get tech savvy or get left behind. You have google assistant making phone calls and booking appointments for you with a human like voice already, do you really think this isn‚Äôt going to happen?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 14:09:58'] I can't really argue that there are some overvaluations happening as a result of the hype. But it's pretty clear you don't understand the power of LLMs even a little. I can't say if the net jobs lost/gained will be positive or negative, but 300 million jobs totally changed, enhanced, or degraded by LLMs is very conservative.The legal field will be one of the first to change. Just because some idiot asked chatGPT (a model trained for very general purposes, with no guarantee that any legal code or case law are even in the training set) about legal stuff and blindly trusted it means exactly nothing. I know of at least one company currently building an attributive LLM, ie a model trained on general purpose language, and then provide sources either from it's training set or database that support what it says. Imagine a legal assistant that can take a verbal description of a case or any situation, and spit out advice and information, for any jurisdiction, footnoted perfectly with sections of the law, relevant cases, sections of the contract being disputed, whatever helps make the case. Imagine this legal assistant can do this for any legal question every 5 seconds. The job of lawyer is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but it will allow each lawyer to do 10 times the amount of work they did previously, at least. If the demand for legal services doesn't rise at the same pace as the cost to provide services tanks, many of the jobs will disappear and the wealth will concentrate upward to the few, lucky lawyers still operating with the help of LLMs.That is just one example. Slight modifications and wrappers around the engine that is LLM technology will soon popup specialized to a variety of fields. What is possible with the technology we have even today, with no further advancements, will only be known when people start putting different components together in creative ways, but is obviously great.That being said, it is difficult to know which company will strike the first huge success here and become the next Google of LLMs. It is possible that company has not even been founded yet, and likely they aren't available for the public to invest in. NVDA will do well selling shovels, but they aren't going to strike gold like a small number of software companies will.TLDR: Puts on tech

I 100% see AI taking over at tier 1 customer support once we build it out. In theory would knock out a lot of jobs, realistically I would see those roles rolling into a higher role or balancing out to other positions in the company.       Saving money by AI is just going to allow better reinvestment into RD, customer relations, and any other lower revenue driving but substantial work practices.

I agree that the 300 million job figure seems inflated and I wonder what was the methodology employed to reach such a conclusion. What worries me more is that legions of middle managers now feel pressured to  have their teams integrate ChatGPT without understanding how the technology actually works. What will it be when ChatGPT produces legal opinion or medical diagnosis? As usual, there will likely be a fallout from the over-enthusiastic bandwagonism.

Right now, it's cool and moving quickly, but eventually the price to make an upgrade in ai will be astronomical and will have a low ROE leading to only the pioneers continuing in the market if they can stay afloat.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 22:05:24'] People act as if AI is something new. Computer scientists have been working on this for decades. Generative AI is sort of a phenomenon of a critical mass in hardware finally being achieved that is for the first time making generative AI doable at a reasonable cost and scale. It‚Äôs a cool new application that people can experience first hand.But what do you call facial recognition that Facebook has had for like ten years? How about credit card software that knows based on your spending history whether with 98% likelihood it is you making a purchase? Is that not also AI?The reason every company is talking AI on earnings calls and in marketing materials is simply because they have to appear as if they are on the cutting edge. It doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, they all follow each other. There‚Äôs nothing new about it and it‚Äôs a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.This is what I think is getting lost in the debate about whether there‚Äôs an AI bubble. The more compelling hardware and applications become the greater the investment in it will be. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that nvda chips were used for video games then crypto mining and now for generative AI- as a new development progresses more and more applications of it take hold. I expect new and better application of generative AI to be developed. But I also expect additional uses of GPUs to be developed. We‚Äôre seeing this now with AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and much more. And it‚Äôs only getting started.Think back to when Intel chips reached a similar tipping point around the mid nineties. What happened? You saw all sorts of unrelated applications of the technology- gaming, productivity, learning, communication, etc. What we are seeing now with Nvidia and a couple other chip makers is a similar tipping point that is going to usher in a sea change. I think it‚Äôs very likely development of applications that tap into this power is going to ramp up exponentially and it‚Äôs very possible Nvidia will eventually become the most valuable company in the world. Yes, others are also producing compelling hardware- Apple, AMD, Google, but each of those are at a disadvantage to Nvidia. But there will be lots of winners in this new field and I think a lot of amazing research is going to come over the next decade.To me it‚Äôs a lot like when they finally figured out the Bessemer process and then in ensuing years all sorts of unrelated things took off- railroads, bridges, high rise buildings, etc. which themselves were transformative. People aren‚Äôt realizing that a lot of the crazes we‚Äôve seen recently are directly related to GPU development enabling them.But labeling it all as AI is very misleading. It‚Äôs probably more accurate to call the overall phenomenon something else. It‚Äôd be like calling the Industrial Revolution ‚Äúa rail bubble‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 00:13:31'] I feel the real issue is with lower level workers.. The people just trying to earn living. From low level graphic artist, to trouble shooting code workers. Things that dont require a lot of effort but not a lot of attention will be replaced, quickly.. Look how an AI won a photography contest. These are humam judges, who are professionals. They couldn't perceive AI generated photo and gave it 1st place. If humans can't determine what IS AI generated at that level of competition then low level workers have no chance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 00:48:13'] I think 300M jobs lost is an over-exaggeration. If that many people lose jobs, they won't have money to spend, and thus the economy including all the companies are gonna go into a shithole cuz they'd all be losing money. I can't say how many jobs could be lost for the short-term, but I reckon it would be a decent amount, but not enough to break the economy. I reckon, instead of AI replacing everyone, people will adapt to use AI as a tool to be more productive at their jobs. If anything, over the long-term, it could add more jobs, or at least improve the productivity of most jobs, and better the economy as a whole.

I do believe there's some short term overvaluation but in the long term it's hard to even put valuation on these companies because the ky is the limit. Thankfully I got in early and I've already made a ton before people started talking about it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 05:27:00']  It's important to approach the topic of an AI bubble with a balanced perspective. While there are certainly areas where the expectations and hype surrounding AI may be overblown, there are also numerous real-world applications and advancements that are driving positive change. The future impact of AI will depend on continued research, responsible development, and the successful integration of AI technologies into various sectors.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 06:22:08'] As somebody who was in "cutting edge" tech in NYC as a programmer/AI developer, it's the tech angel investors jerking themselves off again.  Like with crypto and NFTs, despite being some very tiny nugget of truth in there being a palpable business model, the overhype will kill it/ pump and dump it all.  AI has a bit more teeth than the past few bubbles and we damn well know companies will fire staff while not knowing the limits of AI so the fallout from this bubble might be a bit rough when the many that fail in being "the next best thing" have to come to the reality of their FOMO choices.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 06:22:16'] I agree with you completely except for the puts part.  Markets aren't rational in the short term, and many investors are very poorly informed on this topic, if they were well informed they would have been investing in Nvidia's stranglehold on CUDA 10 years, not now after Nvidia reaped much of the awards and it's baked into the high price already.  I think it will take them some time yet to come down off this high.    I'm not sure how we should gauge when the business cadre will suddenly realize AI isn't pushing the massive profits they seem to expect... because that's when you want the puts for.  Maybe it will show up in some disclosures or something, someone that follows the financial reporting schedules will know far better than I for that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 07:09:24'] What people are calling AI, is actually machine learning. It been around for a while now and it‚Äôs nothing new. They just found more interesting data to train on (ChatGPT). Same as crypto, the media started to report on this and it‚Äôs getting over hyped. Many believe they understand what ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is, after playing with ChatGPT for 15mins. In a similar fashion to crypto, overnight hundreds of new AI startup will appear, run by scammers. They promise you AI will solve all the worlds problems, but when you ask them what data are you training it on, you will never get that answer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 08:33:00'] So because Elon Musk oversold on FSD, you think no one will lose *any* jobs? That's preposterous. There's definitely some sense that it's a bubble, but in the same way the dot com bubble still ushered in an era where the internet was widespread and pervasive in daily life. At this time, everyone will use AI as a buzzword, but there is an inevitability that *someone* will make it out of this having actually made impactful changes on the market
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 08:35:06'] Point taken and yes AI really needs better controls. Recall when the first Intel Pentium came out it had a bug that caused it to incorrectly calculate. This was in the field for months before anyone actually noticed the erroneous results in their spreadsheets and databases. Companies lost money because of the error.   I feel the same will happen with AI. The expectations are so high an not  too many people understand how to validate results. That said AI is not new - its over 60 years in development. What is new is the hardware (Tensocores) that accelerate it and the ability to use many of them to create large models became commoditized and not lab experiments.  It will make the average PC user a power user. It will take repetitive tasks, learn how you do them, and create much faster workflows. It will make all data available to all programs by being able to translate, merge and clean heterogenous datasets on the fly.   This is HUGE.  With the Internet over 80% of a companies data comes from external sources. For home users it is over 93%.  Stated another way - The Macintosh was revered for making computing easy to use. AI is the next step - making computing fully adaptive to the user.   And of course AI is the core of robotics and automation advances.

But used within a solid understanding of those limitations, caveats, and gotchas they're incredibly powerful tools. I don't need general intelligence to replace a third rate marketing copywriter. Because that third rate marketing copywriter has the rest of their life to manage. My absolutely not generally intelligent AI companion is unencumbered by any of that other stuff so it doesn't matter that it's not generally intelligent because all I want it to do is write third rate marketing copy. There are plenty of successful companies out there whose marketing copy is fourth, seventh, or even tenth rate. Their bar is much lower than mine.Do you not see what is happening here or do you simply not want to see it\*?Wake. The. Fuck. Up.From an investment standpoint it doesn't matter whether it's 300 million job losses or 100 million job losses: the order of magnitude is the important bit. From an investment standpoint this *is* the next big thing. During the goldrush it was selling mining tools, 15 years ago it was crypto mining, 10 years ago it was Cloud (and crypto trading), 3 1/2 years ago it was anything ripe to be disrupted by COVID, now it's AI (I know, I'm skipping over a lot here: this isn't intended to be an exhaustive list).Yes, AI is a bubble. Yes, it will burst. No, that will not be yet and I seriously doubt you or I or almost anybody else on this sub has pockets deep enough to weather the stormy peak before the crash.*\*For which I can't really blame you because it's extremely unsettling.*

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 11:36:19'] I do think the AI stuff is being way overhyped. "AI" has been around for a while but we're only now seeing direct consumer products involving AI. A lot of people are also equating the gains OpenAI has seen with GPT to gains in AI technology. GPT 3 to 4 to 5 was getting better because of refining the model and scaling up the infrastructure. They are pretty much already at their limit when it comes to scaling up, all they can do now is take GPT 5 and make it more efficient. They haven't really done anything to make us technologically closer to artificial general intelligence, they've just created a nice product that uses AI.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 15:26:16'] elon always does this kind of stuff to pump the stock price as much as possible. Which means, it's totally possible he's ready to sell again.

It (and AMD which I noticed) are trading around 100 PE which seems crazy compared to TSM for example at 15 PE. I know I should be looking at forward PE but that difference is huge.Obviously NVDA can't run forever, but at this point I don't know what it will take to cause it to pull back. Outside of rising CPI or a miss on earnings (and lowered guidance), can you think of anything near term that would take the wind out of NVDA's sails?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 22:39:28'] Think the bull thesis is valid even though I hold a bearish outlook.&#x200B;I think the market will be flat-ish this year, probably rangebound rotating around the 4000 level. (ie 3800-4200) Issue I have in this scenario is the huge intraday volatility. Ie entering a short here at 4080 levels it is very hard to make risk / reward work when you have a target of 3800 and need to take into account a swing to possibly 4200.&#x200B;But for the market to drop from current levels there needs to be a trigger IMHO. (Which might very well be next CPI, this month saw the downtrend slowing, next month will show if it's going flat or reversing....)&#x200B;Was watching yesterday's price action, my feeling was that the only real trading going on was in the first hour, rest of the day was mechanical/algo action around the OpEx max pain levels. I tried one trade at the dip in the start, around NQ 12325 hoping to hit the 12380/12400 levels, but the little down spike at 09:10 came too close to my entry point (better $100 in the hand then getting stopped out) and left it for the rest of the day.&#x200B;My feeling is that market should be trading around the 3000 level but people forget that inflation will most likely put a floor under stocks, even though it's harmful to company's in the short term. Long term: Raw materials rise 20% -> Companies increase price 25% (profit to be inflation adjusted as well) -> People angry and demand more money -> Continue to buy same  stuff at 25% higher price -> Company profits up by 25% for doing the exact same thing. It takes time for this cycle to play out however, that's why I think inflation is bad short term but creates a floor long term.&#x200B;The real reason it should be bad for stocks at the moment is simply because stocks compete with fixed income assets. Ie you can buy the S&P500 at current levels, but you may also choose to buy for example corporate bonds which give you a pretty good yield on your investment. When interests were zero, this would be in favor of stocks, now this picture has totally changed. This would be the conventional thesis but it does not count for retail massively betting with options which we have seen in the last few years.

The selloff isn't premature, that's just reflecting new data. There's always another PCE or CPI or PPI or FOMC around the corner. Meanwhile more banks are now forecasting a June rate increase with a target funds rate of 5.25-5.50%.It does seem like the market wants to be bullish and without a catalyst I buy into the consolidation period, but I wouldn't go as far to call selling off premature.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-18 13:45:56'] Great unbiased DD. Really appreciate it.Although the consolidation narrative makes perfect sense, I think zooming out and looking at the monthly charts give a slightly different perspective. If Feb ends lower, then we might see a big sell off in March, the weekly candles also look pretty bearish so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this happens.As for Friday‚Äôs action, I was expecting a gap full earlier in the day and dump into closing for Vix to align. Though with the Vix l, it does seem like the S&P can go higher into early next week, though can dump late into the week.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 14:38:35'] Tesla dropped prices pretty aggressively earlier this year. This tranlates to lesser profit per vehicle. Anything less than an absolute blowout yesterday would've put some downward pressure on the stock. The macroeconomic outlook also deteriorated significantly in the last couple of weeks. OPEC decided to shove their pricing power in our face, and the GDPnow Q1 forecast was revised down heavily. Also, check out the official Tesla numbers. https://preview.redd.it/o231e8f34sra1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a7f91b8823b83da163b4980ec0e189bbd66c3de3In 2022, Tesla delivered 67k S/X's. That number does not look like it's going to grow super aggressively this year. The bank run mania might've abated, but restoring confidence in the consumer will take some time. Also, tech bros getting laid off doesn't help TSLA's sales in California. They are likely a key customer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 15:54:50'] Tesla isn't priced as a car manufacturer, it's priced as if it's the leading producer of robo-taxis and the infrastructure to support them. In this hypothetical future car ownership is dead, roads networks are automated, all cars are electric and Tesla has a gargantuan market share of those robo taxis, charging stations and battery farms.That's the future musk's trying to sell and the future the big brokerages bought into. Every time Tesla beat expectations the confidence that this was definitely going to happen compounded. It was obviously going to happen right? Except it's not at all obvious it's going to happen, teslas automation is nowhere near ready for mass rollout and the European giants are making far better evs than Tesla, they've got equivalent automation technology and electric cars are a fucker to produce, they can't get enough lithium and they're too expensive for the working class to afford. Now when Tesla beats expectations it's...expected and no longer of note because the headwinds, competition and slow pace of the move to the new zeitgeist is becoming ever more apparent. That and Tesla ran far, far, far too hot because COVID happened and gambling on stocks became a past time for lots of people who jumped in and got fleeced by the big brokers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 23:22:27'] Is this Tesla‚Äôs metaverse
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 22:26:42'] You guys are fucking morons. At the price point of $20k\* this robot practically sells itself.\* 3 person operating team sold separately. Some assembly required.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 22:21:04'] I love how Tesla has to walk their robots while Boston Dynamics can make their robots dance.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 23:48:46'] It works AS GOOD as self driving cars
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 03:59:49'] It‚Äôs intended to be carried by a Boston Dynamics robot or a human. You‚Äôre just using it wrong because you don‚Äôt want to see people on Mars and you‚Äôre probably a pedo too.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 23:53:19'] It‚Äôs like that one time where they were showcasing the ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù/‚Äúunbreakable‚Äù windows on the Cyber truck and they ended up breaking lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 23:42:05'] Man I wish I'd bought some TSLA shorts and held through the weekend so that I could buy a Boston Dynamics robot in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 22:55:55'] I was hoping that robot would bust some moves when the beat dropped ‚Ä¶ alas ‚Äòtwas just a grandad wobble

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 22:34:24'] Tesla is a stock pump company. Musk needs to give his fanboys something to jerk off to. Since the cult has really low standards, anything will do.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 06:11:28'] They should have put it on a wheelchair and let it drive it casually down stage. Now that would have been futuristic.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 23:05:18'] Tesla is just a big scam
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 05:42:50'] Is Tesla actually a theater company or something? It looks like they took a ‚Äò97 Avalanche and welded aluminum panels on it and called it ‚ÄúCybertruck‚Äù. They got a ton of money from preorders but didn‚Äôt make any. This looks like they had one guy spend a few weeks in a machine shop with some servos and an Arduino Uno and told him to have it do something for the show. It‚Äôs obvious Tesla will never produce any of these at any serious scale.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 08:12:43'] This doesn't look any more advanced than Honda's ASIMO robot, which was released in 2000.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 08:50:14'] Will be fully autonomous next year promise!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 09:53:29'] Did you actually watch it? That model is a concept homie..

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 11:30:01'] That is not what is happening in this picture... Watch the event before posting about an out of context photo. They were assembling the shell of the bot. The bot had no issues walking on its own, although it was a slow awkward walk.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 05:51:28'] Another failed promise that will take years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 01:25:28'] Elon is a total fraud and this robot is just another stock pump to add to the list of all the products Tesla has rolled out that are designed to pump the company. Since Tesla was started and went public the company hasn‚Äôt made any meaningful technology or changed the automotive industry at all. There are no products you can point to that were a first for the automotive industry. Tesla didn‚Äôt cause the entire industry to panic invest billions into R&D and to stop focusing on ICE vehicles. And ICE OEMs certainly aren‚Äôt paying ‚Äújournalists‚Äù to write smear pieces continuously. My point is there is nothing measurable or observable Tesla has created that would disprove my assertion that Elon is just scamming everyone. There‚Äôs nothing because I keep my eyes shut super tight. üò§
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 03:35:42'] Who at tesla has been making insane decisions over the last three years? I left in 2019 and honestly can day wtf. They fired all the really good people to hire younger cheaper options that know absolutely fuck all about the actual industry.  We used to call it "the algorithm " it put the worst possible people in charge of sectors they knew nothing about as a social experiment.  I loved the people i worked with but man wtf
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 02:11:37'] The robot and the presentation are like a high school science project where the fucking group leach gets to present just because he has no shame and needs the extra credit

I‚Äôve spoken to new grads from MIT, PhDs from Cal and many have told me they would never work there due to the toxic work culture. The company‚Äôs reputation precedes it and it‚Äôll suffer long term due to this
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 14:25:04'] Absolute shit product. Boston Dynamics have developed a robot that can run, jump, and do back flips. This piece of junk looks like and 80-year-old man who had his cane stolen!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 16:15:46'] All Tesla have to do is keep doing "advance" projects and they'll be good. They don't have to be practicle, people will rally behind it for now.  Plugging a car into an outlet that use fossil fuels is not advance at all. Call me when they ready to back one of those hydro engine car projects that keeps getting buried.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 18:14:49'] Imma go against the herd here and say if they manage to make a robot thats at least good at some kind of menial factory work (e.g. moving boxes, assuming an iphone, etc), even if it can only do one job thats still a game changer. And even though Boston dynamics is miles ahead of whatever the hell this is, Elon has the balls to push out a half-finished product and start making some kind of money off it so Elon may actually be first to mass product robots of this sort.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 18:23:21'] It‚Äôs like when Elon threw the rock at the truck. It gets more publicity.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 09:52:14'] Not fair. They were very clear that this is a hot of the press physical model to show the packaging of the final product. They showed an earlier bot that walked (poorly) and this was a "but this is likely what the finished bot will look like".   Mind you they built both the software development prototype and the smooth unit here in 6-8 months. They built full virtual models to do "what ifs" to allow alternate methods to be pursued at minimal cost. What the showed was they are about where the famous Boston Dynamics was five years ago. And that took them what 7 years? So Tesla is in Turbo mode and has a good path. They just have to put in the work relentlessly every day.  Its an exciting time.  A lot of robotics is open source with the price curve dropping dramatically.  Musk said this unit will cost around $20K and be very capable. I believe that guesstimate.   The processing power and customized chips are rolling out (same chips needed by Autonomous Driving because that is just a "robot car").  On the AI front, this was AI Day afterall, they demo'd a remarkable leap in one year of effort.  In the end that is the golden nugget. The hardware is all a path to the situational awarness, options and "sentience" of trained AI models and Tesla is building those exceptionally quickly. They are not alone of course.  Its an AI race.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 11:08:34'] Building an automated robot in 6 months with no harness and full movement is an accomplishment. Early in the video
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 06:27:41'] So this showed most people didn‚Äôt watch the presentation. They literally said this was their first time letting it walk untethered. And the pic you showed was them wheeling it out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 15:37:15'] [I was talking with a trading friend about the mkt possibly doing this, this week. instead of bulls buying the gap downs, mkt gaps up then bears sell it down ü§î](https://i.imgur.com/VsnPHD0.jpg)I'm also still weary about going long still. [This is how I trade so if you think it's dumb, that's fine. But even though 4hr wave is starting to make a bullish cross, it still hasn't hit the green buy zone for me. So I still see another attempt to break 390.](https://i.imgur.com/li9maUR.jpg)But yeah, looking like another tricky week of chop trading unless we get some follow through one way or the other.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 19:56:26'] Averaged down slightly on my 4/21 190P NVDA, looking like a hard double top on the chart at 238 so hoping for downside to come
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 13:50:40'] If you zoom out a bit, we once again traded in the same range of a week ago since tuesday.Looks more like it's basing/consolidating for another move higher, imo. VIX literally in the 20s, there's no fear in this market. Was expecting more dump from the PCE surprise, but we got nothing. The ingredient in all of last year's sell-offs was the momentum, as it's harder for the market to sell than to naturally drift higher. We need a catalyst to make it regain momentum, imo. Otherwise bears will probably drop the ball.Reminds me of the December sell-off that stalled after losing momentum, everyone thought it was the start of the next leg down, instead it then moved sideways.Edit: Very telling of sentiment here with bears downvoting my opinion üòÇüòÇ. Last time this happened in January, we mooned right afterwards üòÇüòÇ.

Tomorrow is FOMC minutes and could be a bigger catalyst for direction as we are starting to get some technical weakness here. If bears can take out 390 tomorrow and close under it I think this market starts to really rollover and we start to push back down to that 350 area.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 14:26:56'] Yeah today was the first surprise I‚Äôve had in a few weeks.The whipsaw last week was stronger than predicted. But still predicted. Everyone posted YOLO positions‚Ä¶. so what would the market do? Shake violently until people lost money of course Today I‚Äôm sitting here with no clue what will happen tomorrow. I‚Äôm a bear. The market will have a ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù at some point, but it does a lot of crazy shit before/during. Tomorrow the market could be up 3%, would not surprise me, or down the same amount. It‚Äôs at this perfect point rn (or maybe it was Friday). Where it will go heavy one direction OR go heavy the other direction by ALOT.Red pill or Blue pill, take one. But the flat week is over
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 14:59:14'] Today was not totally unexpected, although I think its too early to start a sell off given that FOMC is a month away with a new CPI in between. I suspect the rest of the week will be largely uneventfull with trading in a tight range. Markets might try a superficial bump tomorrow once they read more of jpow's ' disinflation' wording in the FOMC minutes but more recent data surely doesnt back it.

Australia's RBA minutes were released along with guidance from HD and WMT that basically said to expect less earnings this year.  The RBA minutes were incredibly bearish (dovish on their policy due to economic headwinds).
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:16:02'] If we are in a downtrend, will it hurt company's that beat earnings? Like for example PANW pulled 7% gain on earnings but will it stick if we continue to downtrend in market?

POST_TEXT: b'Today was another one of those days where it was a clear buy the dip narrative. However, it was clearly not presented that way yet again. Now I know basically for the last week or 2 its been every dip is a rip and honestly IF you went into the day with only the mentality that every dip is an opportunity for a call and you didnt look at any other technicals or supporting evidence then you would probably be profitable. \n\nHowever, these sell offs are becoming more and more convincing and more and more supported from a technical standpoint. This isnt just a small retrace in price action to reconfirm support. These are pretty large retraces taking out major support and having a lot of supporting technical that they will continue. However, much like yesterday as soon as those technical show continuation we are getting absolutely rogue out of no where rips and then eventually technical come back to support the bull side. \n\nIT has become increasingly frustrating to trade SPY over the last 2 '

I've realised that yesterday and switched to long theta diagonal calls.imo the market held up very well after the CPI, elliot wave wise SPY has we completed wave 4 so we should see 420 soon. That been said, FX, treasury, bond and PM all showed bearish signs,  its interesting to see what comes next.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 15:00:20'] I'm really starting to want to buy SPY calls now. At least 1 to 2 DTE based on reading your DDs. In reading these, I can only agree with one of the other posters on here: greed is moving the market up even if there's an earnings miss. It's so strange.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 15:26:02'] I think too many retail traders are currently short, or very quickly willing to go short every time the market rightfully shifts downwards.The moment that changes is the moment we finally head down I think, which at this rate appears to be an eternity away.*i.e. options are manipulating the market
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 14:31:14'] The bulltards did it. They don't care about fundamentals. They don't care about economic factors. They don't care about earnings.Most of the bears have left the market and put their money in bonds or cash. The ONLY thing causing any downward movement is bulls taking profit. We all know that at some point this is gonna crash, very much like your average meme stock. The ONLY thing moving the market up is greed.Now, we can profit from this in the short term, but be sure to use stop losses. And avoid holding anything overnight.

I think the market sees it as predictable and defined conditions. I feel buy the dip will continue till something drastic happens. Fed said last year that they see the possibility to keep raising till 2024. Looking at the data, it seems they are on the right track. Having said that, I agree with your sentiment that the push seems a bit halfhearted. Good luck for tomorrow.

POST_TEXT: b'Twas the eve of CPI markets put in a nice low volume green day to day. Roughly its standard $4 +/- move. \n\nLets take a look at my predictions for CPI. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w0xsbxizhba1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dcfa15af2f51c243ec2b288b92010937188dd24f\n\nCurrently I expected a bear on everything but CORE MoM. The one oddity going into this CPI is that the Cleveland fed has an oddly high MoM CPI/ CORE estimate. They are estimating about 0.5% for each. Which for CPI MoM is about 0.5% higher than Bloomberg and consensus and for CORE MoM is 0.2% higher than its estimates. The standard variance is about 0.2% however we have seen a few 0.3 to 0.5% variance outlier this year. \n\nIn my opinion main focus is going to be on CORE YoY. As long as CORE YoY comes in lower I expect a decent green 2-2.5% green open. However, IF CORE was to come in unchanged especially with a miss on CORE MoM I would brace for a 2.5-3% red open. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oy16'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 18:27:29'] Too much media this week about easing rate increases and cuts in q4 or 2024, and Jamie Dimon no longer being an ultra bear or some bs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 16:29:26'] Thinking we are gonna get a miss on CPI tomorrow. Oil went up over Dec (unlike Nov when it dropped), so no easy drop from gas prices. The difference from a year ago Nov - Dec CPI was only .2. Oct-Nov was .6 which gave us our last CPI beat. Two year cumulative CPI is trending at 13.9 (Nov hit this on the nose), which would put us at 6.9 this December with CPI of 7.0 last Dec. Anything under 6.9 implies prices dropped between end of Nov. through Dec. this year, which I don't think was true. Not an economist though, so I could be full of regarded air.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 23:01:33'] 1. Every cost is down. Look at oil and gas, especially gas, that shot got slaughtered in December.2. We were pumping on good cpi in December but the fomc released minutes that said we could go up to 5.1%. People overreacted. And a lot of shorts came in taking spy from 400s down to 380. 3. So what happened this week was shorts closing their positions because they‚Äôre bracing for a good cpi that will invalidate fomc 5.1 target.4. Spy was about to rip 410+ if it wasn‚Äôt for that fomc meeting notes crap. So my guess is we get a good cpi. Shorts cover and we close at 410
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-11 16:25:44'] If we don't have the run up, I would expect a bigger reaction as well. But looking at the crazy IV this cpi is priced at and the last fed day movement (which's also crazy IV pricing). I am kinda agree with jpm that the reaction won't be as big as IV has priced at (which is about 1.5%+ green at open). Personally, I stay out of the play for the tomorrow, wasn't worth it imo, cuz of expensive options.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-12 02:47:25'] I have hard a time understanding the market signals since the start of the new year. I have burned twice on my puts - last Friday and again this week Monday through Wednesday. It feels to me that this is the Santa Claus rally that everyone was calling for in December - Upward move without any rational. To me regarding CPI everyone and their mother and mother‚Äôs boyfriend are calling for a big move. So everyone loads up on options myself included but the market doesn‚Äôt move and all brokers laugh all the way to the bank selling us options. So my prediction is less than 2 percent move on the open and 1 percent at the close. I think we are all getting played, myself included.

POST_TEXT: b'note- reposted due to misspelled word being a banned ticker...   \n\n\nLets talk about today and really the last week of trading\n\nI mentioned that since FOMC I was shocked to see the strength of the market continue and that no matter how hard bears attempted to get momentum it just seemed they were never quite able to take over. The bears would appear to be getting support only for the bulls to turn very clear bearish daily structured candles back into bullish structured candles by the EOD. \n\nToday though the bears finally struck and they struck in a pretty devesating way in my opinion. So lets talk about it here On a side note this was one of the strongest bearish momentum and trend days I have seen since December We actually did not close a single candle over the 15min 5ema today which even on a bullish trend day is not an easy feat \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cqzww26e59ha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=de07de1e9bf3787034f0bdae465a131a9e918ce3\n\nTaking a look'

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 16:53:37'] I was with you on the TSLA trade... I panic sold yesterday morning after the massive RSI defying hulk dick and switched to calls. One of the rare times an emotional decision panned out, allowing me to get back to break even.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 16:18:19'] I think you might have closed your tsla put too soon, could've give it another day and see. I think the correction in tsla might be starting. Yes the pump is ridiculous, but the drop from spy and cpi could give the rally some struggle.personally I just opened a small one (3 weeks long one) today, will average it in here there. Will probably have to close if market getting another rally

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 18:41:57'] Wonderful writeup Dersch.Seems like we got a recession like 2001-2003. Mostly Tech, Crypto and tech related slow down for a reset. I think broader market is doing well and adjusting so I am not 100% sure if inflation will come down frankly to 3-4 by 2023 EOY leading to broader recession. I see house prices in west coast come down that camel hump(2020-2022 mid). So 25-35% down. All high salaries could shrink and normalize but essential workers could see bump. Leading to overall wage growth and job growth good given ‚ÄúEconomy doing great‚Äù talk from Fed, which will be understood by Analysts as Dovish but what they in-fact saying is Hawkish. Higher for longer. I can lift 100 pounds but cant hold 100 for 5+ mins - Pain; my analogy.As usual time will tell.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 23:17:27'] Tesla is the only stock I will never stop buying
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 23:20:29'] Tesla can really be a wild card but it appears to just aim straight for the top of the bear channel from sitting at the bottom of that channel when zooming out on the daily charts. It might be a little too early to start shorting especially with such a short time frame. I'm looking at the $220-$240 range to see if it will break through but with all the macro at the moment, I'm thinking it'll pop it's head over the trend line and 200ma to trap the bulls before reversing.To me, 2022 had strangely been following the bear channel a little too orderly and the market makers are switching things up. I noticed SPY always starts a bull run after breaking above the 200 MA and staying above it (this was before it got posted on wsb). This can be seen when zooming out and going back into the last inflation induced recession in the 70s and even further. With retail traders seeing this, market makers could very well manipulate this and it could be the biggest bull trap in history.With the 10yr-3mo Treasury yield being the most inverted we've ever seen before any previous recessions, if we take the average time of about 1.5 years from the initial inversion, we should be seeing stock capitulation second half of 2023.But I'm with you on having a bad year so far, sold spy calls that ended up itm so now I'm just relying on theta to decay and may consider rolling them. I've been selling csps to try to hedge that position which helps with losses. I've tried flipping options before but have often found myself in your position. When I get the direction wrong, I try to wait it out or double down, which adds to my losses usually. I realized by selling, I can take smaller losses but it does take a lot more capital..
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 03:16:20'] Still holding my 415 spy calls for 14th gonna average down if we can keep above the 405.30 support. If we leg down towards that 400.80 resistance I'm going to open some 405 calls for next week I feel good about a 405-417 range post cpi. Wish me luck. Also unrelated but I'm proud of my 4.50$ lumen calls netting me 43% yesterday on iv alone was my only good trade of the day. Still holding a bunch of 100-105 goog calls for the 17th as well. Any thoughts on cutting losses or averaging down on goog?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:46:41'] We can retrace next week. My calls want to print.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:52:51'] Dotcom bubble and 2008 bear market had rallies where SPY went 25% before making new lows. I'm not saying we'll make a new low, but we're not out of the woods yet and could go all the way back down to 380s again easily
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 16:23:23'] I think tomorrow we open down .75% or so on SPY and tread there for a little, maybe dip some, then have another full V shaped recovery to test 418 again, then sell off into close to be flat on the day. Trap the fomo bears in the morning, fomo bulls in the afternoon, and option sellers win at the end of the day. Then Monday/Tuesday drop it to retest 406.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 17:32:15'] My 350 SPY puts expiring in May were actually solidly in the green intraday from that run up in IV.Im hoping we see blood red tomorrow and for the weeks to come all the way down into the SPY 380 range.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:37:23'] Luckily managed to snag VIX 2/15 18C when it was at 17.30, sold them when we got near 18 the second time for a 42% profit. Felt pretty good until I watched those same calls hit 100%+ an hour later. Hard to complain about a very nice profit but that was crazy to watch as it just did not stop rocketing for almost an hour straight.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:57:49'] I didn‚Äôt know what to attribute it to but I noticed what I think you‚Äôre referring to as odd IV. Bought long dated puts in spy at about 416.8 and it gained in value even when it hit 418. I was confused but not complaining. Looks like the party might be over with google Amazon and apple not benefiting from the mad Bull craze

Tesla has never had competition in the marketplace until now, and they've always relied on government subsidies to stay alive. Not exactly a great outlook for a small tech company in the car biz. Certainly not for one that's about to be competing for the first time with about a dozen global automotive giants, who all individually have more than enough resources to squash Tesla like a bug.

POST_TEXT: b'We finally got CPI consensus this morning and so far looks like we could get a CPI YoY beat, CORE/ CPI MoM miss (big one) and CORE YoY unchanged to miss I will post later this weekend my analysis for all of that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxseik8amfha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=804300fff1109c342259c0a024ab8f7f0c40e6b7\n\nTaking a look at the daily here I suspected that we would after failing to do so yesterday come down and touch this 405.3 support. Now I did fully expect this to continue lower into that 400-402 area today. However, incredibly we actually saw a ton of strength off that 405.3 today and I dare say that Monday this is likely to see a close back between 410.6 to 414.4 leading into CPI. CPI will absolutely be the deciding factor of 430 or 390 next. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4hbxolsamfha1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6398b7a75ea8c86213121edd695ebbb395ba0a68\n\nA few interesting things to note here on the weekly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 13:58:26'] HYG and QQQ are showing the most aggressive money rotation this entire bear market. 10y yield also broke out. I think with a CPI beat we get that squeeze new higher high but from there I think it‚Äôs a short especially if HYG/QQQ‚Äôs lag on the run. I‚Äôm not gonna bet against the historical JPM rotation and the tuesday top pattern (assuming we do indeed pump CPI). We also got the bearish Macd cross on spy. Historically, sample size is small but during past two tops. We get ~2 days of green then a dump. I betting on that to continue.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 14:59:30'] When you say ‚ÄúCPI beat‚Äù what do you mean? It‚Äôs kinda confusing. Does ‚Äúbeat‚Äù mean hotter than expected?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 15:17:53'] I really wanted to enter some calls today leading into CPI but sat cash instead, was afraid of a rouge power hour move. Based on no factual information, I still think this bull market continues after CPI.Didn‚Äôt they change the way it‚Äôs reported/calculated? I have a feeling the numbers next week will look bullish under this new system, otherwise known as manipulation to keep propping the market up
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 14:57:10'] With the price of Eggs an heating oil in Jan, CPI could be coming in hot.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 21:11:31'] Sold my $LYFT put and $SOFI leap for ant gains almost $1K, but was hesitant to play $TSLA based your previous DDs. I have $SPY puts that I hope will turn green if CPI goes as you predict because I'd rather enter a new position later this year instead of rollout for the one that has a 3/31 expiry. I might do a $TSLA straddle ATM next week so I can manage my risk for the CPI reporting.  As always, you're doing the Lord's work, and I thank you for it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 18:55:20'] I'm on my phone so bare with me on my screenshots. I like to find patterns in spy/spx/es. When I find these patterns I noticed spy usually does the opposite the 2nd time.[Several weeks ago I noticed the failed gap down on a bull flag and you can read what I wrote in my screenshot. Anyways, I was pretty confident the gap down was just a bear trap for a squeeze which ended up happening.](https://i.imgur.com/ZLADjvX.jpg)Now, that brings me to this week. [Similar daily pattern played out last month. Jan 18 was red day followed by gap down and tight range all day. Market likes to do the opposite to fuck over traders. that's why I'm leaning bearish  next week and also wavetrend made daily bear cross in overbought zone. But I'll be ready to switch to calls if I'm wrong.](https://i.imgur.com/G0E8xfU.png)
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 14:20:46'] Felt today was pretty rough to trade, fairly tight range and lots of rogue $.5+ candles that wiped out 1DTE options if you bought at the wrong time. Made a single trade that I sold 2 minutes after buying for a 6% gain. Best part was it went -15% a few minutes later so being disciplined really paid off. Gonna sit Monday out and see what price action we get, going to place another strangle EOD so want to conserve cash until then. Thinking that with the numbers released today we‚Äôre primed for a miss, which reinforces Powell‚Äôs hawkish stance and shows that inflation is going to be stickier than the market has been pricing in this run up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 14:24:28'] They revised the Nov and Dec inflation prints, showing them hotter than they actually were. Which means that inflation report for Jan might look better than it actually is in comparison to the revised earlier hot prints. Also, the consensus expectations for this print arent' as demanding as the last two. It could potentially be a beat with all this mind...

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 16:03:49'] I'm really thinking that the CPI number will cause a fairly drastic swing in either direction. Have you ever considered playing a straddle/strangle for this particular CPI?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 16:58:32'] cpi wise I'm not seeing any surprises/major movesif you look at MoM CPI it is pretty clear that headline inflation is dragged up by the first half of 2022, especially Apr/Jun/Jul with 1%+ MoM increase. With how weak inflation in 2nd half of the year, headline figure will come down very naturally to near 2% over the next 6 month. Imo this is why market reacted so positively at the last FOMC despite Jpow having a rather hawkish tone, it is the first time the FED acknowledges this and it signaled the end of rate hikes.For the market to move significantly there needs to be a change in expectations, unless we get a 1% MoM cpi i simply can‚Äôt imagine why it would happen.I‚Äôm bearish on the market just by how extended it is but signs are pointing to short volatility

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 14:27:00'] This is why predicting market move is never easy. Even though I still leaning toward red week, but today's low volume red day kinda gave me some doubt.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 14:35:53'] At this point it‚Äôs just better to scalp cheap 0-1 DTE calls or puts for tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 13:34:39'] >It is no surprise that the markets have been volatile recently, with JPOW's speech tomorrow likely to be a major factor in determining which direction they will move next.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-06 21:53:10'] Inflation has come down on a monthly basis since that august meeting showing the fed can restore price stability and their tools are working. Even if we did a have a strong jobs report we don‚Äôt have the data on how that‚Äôs going to effect inflation yet. My guess is the fed gets arrogant and thinks they can handle the inflation regardless of the jobs being added. Loading up on calls

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 04:26:44'] Over the next two years Tesla is going to face the most competition it has ever had since its Inception. Tesla has not patented any of its technology it's all open source so everyone is stealing it and building their own electric cars. It doesn't take a genius to realize Tesla's business model is designed to fail. If you look at what General Motors is doing they are going to take over the automotive industry when it comes to electric cars and they're offering the same thing  Tesla is offering except better looking cars. More importantly the evaluation of GM is only six times earnings right now making it a very good buy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 18:13:22'] This may actually be a genius gamble.  It is gambling just to be clear.There are so many puts on the market and everyone is so bearish, there may actually be a huge surge upside as market makers would get f‚Äôd otherwise paying out puts.  Good luck, ballsy and best of all, who doesn‚Äôt want the market to go up, every working American has some kind of retirement saving tied to the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 17:48:07'] It's clear you hate money. Let's see; Bear mkt, we're in a recession (we can say that word now that the midterms are over), the Treasury is flipping from liquidity provider to draining 2x what it put in (because the midterms are over), the cost of borrowing is ratcheting up (ciao huge buybacks), TSLA has a ridiculously high p/e, and the cherry on top of the shit pie -Elon has filed publicly, his huge selling. I guess capitulation happens one special needs gambler at a time.

As I mentioned last week and really for the last 2-3 week I am bullish on the markets and the bulls notched another win today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jof46q5c2vda1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=200c74c563faa757b04ced53aaec3536eee8ac51\n\nDoing a slightly zoomed out look today on the daily chart to show you a few things I am eyeing. The first is the we are here tag from back in November. If you remember in October we did a ton of consolidation before we started out leg up. That was followed by an aggressive pullback and then that led to a bigger push up before we entered the consolidation in December around CPI. I believe we are in a similar time period. \n\nWe have FOMC next week and as of right now it seems all but ensured that we will get a 25bps hike. This is bullish for markets and I believe many are expecting the fed to pause after this hike. A pause come when we go to no rate hike or decrease of rate hikes. Now this'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 15:36:34'] None of the fed members talked about pause, not even dovish dally. Where is this ‚Äúpause‚Äù coming from? In fact, almost all mentioned that the downward inflation, froth is easy path 9-6ish. Getting below 6-4 and 4-2 are the hardest ones. So lower rate hike was favored and higher for longer.  I believe fundamentals and strength (earnings) are ignored. Even Netflix missed   Real earnings when you account for 7M subscribers vs 4M. Lot of free subscriptions and they can run this story as long as possible until it dries up. Just an observation. May be not everything is trend, VVIX suggests risk on risk is cheap now. Vix is hungry!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 14:03:35'] You‚Äôre saying 1 additional .25% hike is the difference between 430 and retesting October‚Äôs lows??

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 19:48:24'] Agreed with your analysis. Daily chart for SPY shows Support at 380 and Resistance at 410. If we can hold 410+ = Market may reverse. If we lose 380, we will retest 350 and below again. Personally, I feel they are going to set this as a bull trap, and after February, shit is going to hit the fan for us to go down again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 14:29:02'] I am betting on terrible tech earnings forecast that will dump the market or at least bring some sense to the markets. I also think Fed has no option but to continue the hawkish tone even with 25 bps hike. There is absolutely zero case for bull market at this point without support from fundamentals.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 17:27:28'] Something has changed in the markets. We have been over a year in a bear market, and 3 months in consolidation.Big moves happen after such a consolidation, too many puts, the bears have ran out of ammo, the market has priced in a lot of the doom and gloom.I'd say this rally is the classic "climbing the wall of worry".It may roll over next month, but first the puts need to get wiped out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 17:31:08'] You should just inverse this guy as he clearly is delusional.  The fed isn't going to stop after .25bps that would undoubtedly undo everything they have achieved this far. Inflation is not over by a long shot.The markets are too bullish given the feds outlook and that will come to an end in the coming fomc. The fed has stated multiple times they are not done hiking and any market rally will be short lived. Let's add on to the fact that the market is placing some probability in a 0 point hike. And 99% in a 25bps with none going to 50bps. I think that given the markets sentiment to fight the fed, that inflation is going to be persistent and they are desperately trying to avoid the mistakes of doing nothing it makes a lot of reasonable sense that they do something like .50bps.

Now that Tesla is facing numerous challenges, and he's clowning over at Twitter, it's pretty clear that they are going to stumble sooner than later.&#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/kusxupxsc7aa1.jpeg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dfd4c0b283be71e5065645edbfbc1d48c080b9fa

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 01:47:30'] It‚Äôs just that the industry sense is their market share is at its peak and will now start waning year over year as more and more big companies penetrate the EV market with cars that are now direct competitors with the largest volume Teslas. For example: The VW ID7 is directly aimed directly between the Tesla model 3 and the Model S. Before the large mfgs only had smaller ‚Äòniche‚Äô or ‚Äòme too‚Äô cars like the Nissan Leaf ir the Chevy Volt. Now the big players with much larger dealer networks are bringing Trucks and larger SUVs to the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 06:17:05'] They have been able to grow in a more or less competition free environment. When all it takes is a few billion from ford to retool several plants that have the same production capacity as Tesla then they are in trouble. Not because gord is going to be great at making evs. Because Tesla doesn‚Äôt have anything to offer that will be better than them. Some people want to act like making evs is like making rocket ships but it‚Äôs just a car with a different drive train and motors.

So maybe Gates had reason to believe Tesla wouldn't do well. And also half a billion isn't a lot to Bill Gates. So don't act like he's hell bent against your convertible launching cult leader.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 21:26:08'] I like your thinking. I rolled some March DTE puts this week to Feb, expecting the gap down to happen sooner rather than later‚Ä¶ and was promptly punished for my lack of patience.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 22:21:53'] I want to thank you for a very well written report on the markets. I look forward to them everyday. I know from following you on your day trades you do a stop loss of 20%. I know the TSLA was an overnight. I am curious why you did not hold since you were down 94%? Or did you have a SL on and it auto sold on open?I am in the bear camp for all the reasons you pointed out. An interesting fact about the VIX. Most people use it to measure fear. You pay the highest prices for stocks the lower it is. The higher the VIX the cheaper you can buy stocks.Keep on keeping on. You are good at this! Thank you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 22:32:40'] I‚Äôve recently joined this group and your by far a great writer and thanks for sharing your knowledge.  Tesla has been real bank for me this year.  The last 3 weeks has been golden, I just feel directionless going into next week.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 19:23:42'] Good analysis. Mr. JPOW will not stop and should not stop. Inflation has to come down a lot for things to feel normal. Assuming he is able to bring inflation down followed by a spiraling recession, there is no euphoria left for the market to keep going up. Today we could not breach 400. We came close but it got rejected. At that rejection someone got 555 0 DTE 4000 SPX puts and in 5 minutes doubled their money. Dam good trade. Futures rejected 4020 too. I feel we may spike here and there but overall it is bearish till Fed officially announces that the party has started. Have a good weekend and a happy birthday to your son.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 19:41:49'] Another great analysis. Again, my concern is the optimism on TSLA's trend. Although in a technical lens it seems like TSLA could be breaking out of this pattern and recovering, the consistent downgrading combined with the continuous negative sentiment and especially tightening of margins, I think it will continue to disappoint for the near future (especially if earnings miss which may very likely happen with the surprise delivery miss). Be careful. I tried following careful TA with TSLA (on the upside) the last few months and it got me destroyed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 06:54:08'] Great post, thank you for taking the time and effort By looking the Dow chart, one might think we might be entering an uptrend, what do you think? 0dte: I find myself exhausted from this trading and I do not think anyone can make money long term unless he has a steady bet each time. Needs a lot of control, if you win and increase your open contracts in the euphoria you lose at the end. I lost money for the first time on Friday on the spy because I was arrogant. Thinking of my profits, none came from 0dte that lasted. Made profit from BAC 18 calls 2025 position that I opened in December. It may sound a boring position but the money came from there (and other similar positions) not 0dte. And 0dte trading takes a lot of time from researching what to trade. Whereas the BAC trade literally did not make me blink for a second, actually I was adding in December on the down days.https://preview.redd.it/f6uyz1s2d2ca1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=246ee9285900f74a046e74d658be0cae947b20c5
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 10:32:36'] I don't think there is any easy way out. The dollar is already showing a ton of weakness. If the fed stays the current path of slowing down  or pausing, dxy will probably dump even further. What's next? Commodity prices jump back up, and we go back over 7% CPI. It's already happening, massive bullflag on WTI crude, food prices skyrocketing, etc  Furthermore, the fed being dovish will not stop the market from dumping. In fact it's usually the signal to dump it, as it means the fed is anticipating a recession. There's this fantasy that we can reduce inflation while spending continues to go up at a crazy pace. I'm not an economist, but that doesn't sound realistic.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 20:02:47'] Great insight as always!So interestingly enough I‚Äôve noticed that every time we‚Äôre close to a peak, we get some frothy trading in meme stocks. The last time around in August, we saw a massive blow off top in BBBY. We‚Äôre seeing similar trading this time around, along with big moves in some crypto miners. I would be unsurprised if this wedge breaks at some point in the coming week.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 17:59:10'] What are you. Some kind of book writer ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 01:24:08'] SPY put in 4 green days in a row with relatively weak volume (aside from CPI day the other days were only about 65M vol which is low compared to the 10d avg). The fact that SPY only inched up to 398/399 (double top this week btw) when VIX is extremely low makes me think the rally is running out / already out of steam. The last time SPY put in 4 green days in a row was the September 7-12 2022 rally. Then on September 13 we sold off from CPI. I guess there is no catalyst (data/news) coming on Tuesday 1/17 though.

My target price came out to $50 as well I just didn't want to post it because I knew I would get a lot of shit from people.I think we are not that far from $50 , everytime musks appears anywhere stocks drops like 15% that week .When it hits 50-60 I might start buying tesla leaps if the company still looks like it can be saved. Hopefully by that time musk is gone from tesla by some miracle
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 00:14:29'] The idea that the market makers are going to watch TSLA sink to 65 without any desire to scoop millions of shares for the long haul at an obscene discount is truly mystifying.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 23:47:16'] >I disagree. Tesla is a well-built company with strong fundamentals. The stock price will continue to rise in the long run, despite any short-term market corrections.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 07:26:49'] Assuming earnings estimates are even remotely accurate, that would put Tesla at a forward PE of 12 or so. That's pretty damn low for a company with this much promise, high margins, innovation, growth, etc. I'm not a holder, but these levels are already looking attractive for people who are smart enough to realize Tesla is not simply a car company.Who knows what happens, but 65 sounds low. I think Tesla will be seeing a nice bounce soon in the same way we saw with Meta, where the market basically says "hold up, this is getting out of hand".
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 00:04:02'] Almost every analyst says the stock price way underpriced right now. I don‚Äôt see it dropping that low. If it did I‚Äôd buy it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 03:04:21'] $65 is not insane, I was thinking $70-$80, so $65 is not too far off the bottom of the range.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 04:54:58'] Once this pile of garbage gets repriced as either a car company or a conglomerate that it is I‚Äôm looking for pe of 12-15 at the most more likely 10 because recession and all Phantasie being gone from the stock plus a volatile leader.  Remember that with margins reducing you can‚Äôt just divide the current price by 4. It can go wayyyy lower

The stock price wasn‚Äôt based on fundamentals or even numbers of any kind at $400‚Ä¶.and it isn‚Äôt now at $137‚Ä¶ and it won‚Äôt be next year either.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 12:32:55'] I was shopping around for a 4 door car earlier this year, wanted something that could haul babies while being fast. Tesla wasn't on my list until after the price drops so I got a full dose of the dealership experience. You can't buy anything now for MSRP unless it's a couple of years old. God forbid you want something semi-rare like a widebody charger or higher trim BMW/porsche- dealers will just fuck you over so badly. The Tesla dealer experience is like 5 minutes to set up a test drive, like 5 minutes to buy a car, no markups, no bullshit, it's not even close. And the build quality for my car was fucking perfect. I've put a few k miles on it so far and no rattles or anything. Anyway Cramer is pretty much confirming what I suspect- Tesla is going to be fine. Not 3000/share fine, but fine.

Molded plastic seats, a/c but it doesn't have to be the best a/c, * a single phone mount and that acts as my dash/speedometer/radio/nav/etc. I don't need a touch screen or anything. Just a plug and a single speaker and I'll use my phone or some dogshit cheap-ass android tablet from Amazon. It can even just come with an Anker speaker. That's fine.* optional hydraulic for the bed so I can dump with it.* should ship with just the primer. I will paint it myself. Hell, include some dents and scratches at the factory so I don't have to worry about it.* I don't even care if it's fully assembled. This would be a perfect for a run down to home depot to get some plywood and the occasional run to the city dump. Company would get into the black in 37 seconds from farmers alone. Hell, I can even see these used on work sites, small contractors, large plant nurseries, home gardeners (if I can load 2 yards of dirt in the back and dump it in my garden, win).Make this for sub-10k and take my money.

They‚Äôre constantly changing the options, which changed the build, that put them out of business because they couldn‚Äôt get a vehicle to market. The handling of the Tesla truck reminds me of that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 19:49:21'] I also had a 410 ceiling on the bounce but adjusting for time, I would adjust that to a euphoric best-case-scenario of 415 SPY.Then I'm looking for a drop to 350.Why?Fed has said the beatings will continue (they will maintain the rates, not drop them) until unemployment increases dramatically to break labor.Whatever you read - they have only ever hammered home the unemployment numbers and everything else to them has been 'soft numbers'. They keep insisting that all indications the inflation is subsiding and the economy is cooling is 'premature' and would risk 'baking in' inflation.I believe there is a desire to get people under control. Powell complained that people shouldn't have two jobs - there shouldn't be that many jobs available. (A monotonous but harsh comment during one of his Q&A sessions).The dude REALLY hates LABOR for the past year and a half.He has also stated they think there is enough money in the system to do what they attempted in 2016 - start actively selling into the market. They had originally planned to start that up last year but then Ukraine happened. They said they were holding off because they were worried about geopolitical situations outside of their control.And escalations are still on the table.Unless we get some serious escalations that whirls up the war machine (everyone is pushing very hard for that - because that's the last lever we have to fight inflation), I see us at least flash crashing to 350 at some point over something. Anything.WSJ has been putting out pieces claiming we'll have a serious downturn in the next 30 days. I don't think it's easy to time things - that's their prediction based on economist sorcery.But I don't put it past them.Especially after the 'glitched' market wide halts that had broken trades (also, how do we have so many broken trades anymore? Before 2020 I don't think I ever heard about trades getting broken. It's gotten wild).If you read this far - congrats, nerd.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 16:10:36'] Tsla, NVDA, Coin etc incredible run over the last few weeks. Buying with no fear is concerning when fed is still tightening and earnings are compressing. I feel this is a trap, but not as big as previous traps lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 17:54:44'] Always, always the best TA in town. I picked up on that VIX strangeness too. I didn't like it. I tapped out my 14DTE calls once we hit that 408. I wanted to be a winner this weekend. Take care sir.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 18:44:56'] Honestly a pullback monday or tuesday would be healthy. No more fuel for this rally until FED meeting
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 15:46:45'] Sold Tesla too early. Was in denial it can go past through 176 this fast. I was expecting it to happen next week. Also Amazon earning on Thursday. It‚Äôs going to be a wild week!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 18:10:57'] For the past few months, the feds has been putting out the word that there will be no rate cut this year! The market meanwhile has been ignoring the feds: - The financial conditions are as loose as last April (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NFCI) - Rate is pricing even lower at 4.3 end of this year than just 3 weeks ago at 4.6Essentially the market is thumping their nose at the feds. I think they will surprise and do 50 to regain credibility just like the BOJ surprised back on 12/20 with the YCC news! This ensures the feds are dead serious that come spring/summer we don‚Äôt see the resurgence of inflation. If the market crashes, it will be a great buying opportunity as it will be the last raise. If the feds does 25, market will bounce but the watch out for inflation to raise again. My 2c.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 20:16:12'] Thats why everybody likes a bull market. Even though calls sold earlier you still made money. The buyer of those calls also made money and probably the next buyer too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 04:25:09'] > I mentioned today that SPY closed out that evening doji start pattern and looking at the VIX this very well could be a morning doji start pattern also. That would mean Monday the VIX will get a nice reversal most likely back over 19 and SPY should Monday see a pretty good sized reversal.Thought this as well.  Don't normally buy puts at close with a next trading day expiration but felt the risk was worth it for Monday.&#x200B;> Something else to factor in next week is earnings of course. AMD on Tuesday otherwise we are pretty clear sailing until Thursday where we get a pretty big day with Google and Apple. Which could very likely be a wild storm with FOMC the day before‚Ä¶ Tuesday before the bell is huge.&#x200B;It's those things we don't believe can happen that create our blind spots.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 05:54:10'] It amazes me sometimes others perspective on SPY where we think the resistance is the strongest. I also believe resistance will be pretty strong around the $410 area and expect a hard rejection from this area. Thanks for your DD.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 14:03:20'] Are you being too bulish  on the SPY ? If we listen to what JPOW keeps telling everyone it isn't that hard - They will continue untill the job is done. Essentially they will never announce a pause unless inflation goal is meet. Announcing a rate pause is basically inviting inflation. 25 bps  is garanteed Another 25 bps is also highly likely They will keep us on our toes for the foreseeable future.

I agree that the market is going to likely take anything he says as bullish and go past 410, but what if some combo of Amazon/Apple/Meta have poor earnings. Decisions decisions. On the other hand, Netflix, Tesla and Microsoft all ended up being received positively so I feel like regardless of what happens everything is bullish
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 00:53:57'] I‚Äôm thinking of buying a few May 19 362 puts. I don‚Äôt think the FED is going to be very dovish aside from 25 BPS hike, given the recent rally, I think JPOW will put his foot down. Thoughts?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 23:42:46'] You forgot the other possibility is that Tesla goes way higher and never comes down and you lose money and instead of averaging down you just average your way into more losses.Also, you really better hope they never announce a major advance in FSD while holding a short position, because if investors develop confidence in FSD the stock could easily go to a market cap of 2T overnight. I admit the chance of this happening in the short term is pretty low, but realize there is a potential massive catalyst here that can absolutely destroy anyone short here.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 13:19:06'] It's been interesting to watch the evolution of IV behavior around FOMC. Last FOMC saw premium plummet for both puts and calls all while SPY gyrated around by several percent every few minutes. I will buy puts after JPOW speaks and IV plummets hopefully.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 13:39:28'] Do you think we can see a red day tomorrow? Or just a theta day heading into FOMC
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 17:34:53'] This is what I feel will happen ‚Ä¶. On Fomc day we will spike exactly at 2 pm since they will raise rates only 25 bps. Then we stay elevated until 2:30. At 2:30 Jay will come out and will speak super hawkish and we will give up all those gains and close flat or little bit negative. Next day is mega earning day so we will be flat all day and then depending on earning outcome, which in my case will be a miss we dump 100 points o spx on Friday.

POST_TEXT: b"Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.\n\nThis investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with "

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 10:31:46'] Musk news is fun to watch because of how salty redditors and other wannabes get about it.  I don‚Äôt really care about him one way or the other but the level of personal butthurt some people have about him is hilarious.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 09:37:10'] My tinfoil theory is that there is a lot of poison in the offer, so Twitter says no and Musk can say ‚Äúsee they don‚Äôt want the deal. ‚Äú
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 09:42:39'] He also said that illegally annexed parts of Ukraine should hold a UN supervised vote should take place to see if they want to join Russia and that the Illegally Annexed Crimea is historically part of Russia so it‚Äôs also Russia. Seriously fuck Elon Musk, have a stroke and die you piece of garbage.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 10:15:56'] DWAC will likely die because of this. If he unbans Trump, zero reason for TruthSocial to exist. Watch Trump return to Twitter, leave his followers with $10 bags, and a dead social media platform when they aren't allowed back on Twitter, but he is.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 10:37:22'] It seems like taking money from TSLA and using it to fund this deal is a breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty and possibly of care owed to TSLA investors... How can he just shit on TSLA to get the cash to make such a dumb deal? If it somehow goes through I'm buying long puts on both twtr and tsla. Elon himself is becoming a major liability.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 09:59:42'] I think he see's the whole purchase now as an inflationary action. It looks like the central banks are blinking which means more long term inflation. That original offer price is now cheaper than it was by the action of the currency inflating.  It makes sense now to move his resources into an asset than see it lose actual value via inflation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 11:02:12'] Used car market was trying to sell Teslas for more than MSRP brand new because the supply was so low.

The only thing making it so volatile is papa Elon.I dont anticipate huge gains,  maybe it will go up 10-15% end of Q3 if the cybertruck doesn't have egregious issues (or is actually produced),  but I think we can anticipate 2-4% growth each quarter from here on out, higher if the gigapacks become a peice of infrastructure widely adopted, but thats going to be a slow burn until there are more EV'S and the grid system has issues with the electrical demand. Conservatively,  I anticipate it will be 12% higher this date of next year, bullish....31%, barring an Elon outburst or a deepening recession.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-03 18:34:33'] Tesla is undervalued in the long term but the market is getting frothy and stock prices are determined by bids and asks. If the whole market trend down, individual stocks trend down. So stocks might go down to Dec lows.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-04 21:51:18'] Looking at the daily chart you can see the RSI is sitting at 72. Meaning a healthy pullback or chop is likely due soon but you never really know with Tesla. There‚Äôs major resistance at 199, which is already touched and rejected. The 20 EMA looking to push the 50 EMA so you should watch to see if it rejects in the coming days. I‚Äôm not that good with fibs but I‚Äôm seeing 176 and 160 possible supports. And the 160 support is near the 50 EMA so should support well if it were to drop that low. Not much resistance till 230 levels, after a break and hold of 199 and psychological support level 200.You can catch the pullback or wait for it to drop and get in on the way back up. But don‚Äôt chase with calls till confirmation

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 04:30:40'] Today Pre-market $197.50... I'm looking at both the daily and 4 hour charts. They're showing consolidation on low volume where the recent high was retested and pulled back. On the hourly chart the RSI and macd appear to be weakening indicating a pull back could be close however on the daily chart they are still rising but closing the gap.  The current rising channel from January 3 has perhaps 2 more sessions on both charts before we have confirmation of a breakout above $200 or a pullback with a potential to $167...  Comments anyone?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 05:18:12'] Looking further at the chart on a 30 minute basis, over the past 2 weeks, there is a very clear Pennant formed that traditionally would indicate a possible breakout. If it breaks out my near term target is $207 as this is the bottom of my predicted potential trading range of $207-$256 for 2023...  This all depends on confirmation signals over the next 2 days.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 06:22:17'] > A PE ratio of 30 is reasonable. Okay. Let me explain for all the regards out there. A high PE indicates a high growth-potential. Any company worth 2 trillion should have a lower PE because there is only so much upside for a 2 trillion dollar company. A PE of 30 is therefore fucking insane. As well when considering that a car-company has lousy returns on invested capital so again, a 30 PE is insane. And Tesla isn't anything else than a car company. If not, provide me with the revenues/profits per non-car segments and prove me otherwise.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 05:54:26'] This ignores a ton of potential variables.One, Tesla will eventually reach a tipping point where there aren‚Äôt enough people that (1) can afford their prices and (2) want a TeslaTwo, if they create a more affordable vehicle the per unit profit margins won‚Äôt sustainThree, *eventually* competition will eat into their market in a meaningful way
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 05:45:05'] Just a question why are you using Q3 when Q4 was lower and price cuts have made margins lower and Elon confirmed on the Tesla conference call. Q4 was only impacted by maybe a month where the price cuts have become standard starting 2023. Why do you believe that margins will go up which goes against everything their conference call suggests.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 06:57:21'] I will say this though.  Last year was the first Tesla I ever say in SW Florida.  Now I see them more often and yesterday I saw 2 of them like 6 cars apart in traffic.  They have what I thought was a dealership in the next city over.  They have hundreds of cars parked outside so if they are all sold out they need to get them out quicker.  Plus still haven't seen any charging stations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 07:34:42'] The biggest problem with your reasoning is saying that 30PE for it would be cheap. A PE of 30 is cheap when your company grows 50-100% per year. It will suddenly become way too much when your company stops growing or only grows 10-15% a year. Tesla will reach that point sometime, the only question is when. Will they reach this point in 2024? 2025? 2030? There is a reason that the biggest automakers currently trading at a PE of 3-8. Tesla would worth $220 billion or so with a PE of 3 even if they would sell 6 million vehicles with said margins (maintaining it is basically impossible, given that other automakers are already catching up), less than half of their current market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 05:33:58'] >I completely agree with your assessment of Tesla's long-term prospects. The company is innovating in many different areas and has a strong brand that should allow it to continue growing at a rapid pace.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 15:26:27'] I was expecting a relatively flat to red day today, didn't expect the v shape recovery though. But I wouldn't count the bears out yet still. Tsla earning and guidance is ok, which means good chance of green tomorrow, but tomorrow we also have some data coming out and pce friday.Everyone expecting the data to be good, thus we are having this rally. In this sense, market will sell off on any hint of "bad data" again. Not to mention fed day next week. Gonna be volatile as always.edit: Also I have to disagree with you new low, first 1-2 months of the years are generally pretty good, the next 3-6 month is the real test. Pretty sure most people have heard this already, everyone says that recession will happen after fed pause. Does recession means new low, not necessarily right? I think 3500-3600 is still totally possible again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 15:24:11'] I‚Äôm playing extra careful $SPY at this range. The $VIX has actually been helping me trade and hold my conviction on my plays. I‚Äôm actually staring to favor puts now at the current $VIX level. It will take any random bearish news or just a random day to finally get the sellers back on. I don‚Äôt think we necessarily need a reason. True sell offs are harder to predict, but FOMO is starting to kick in and that‚Äôs about the time the rug is Finally pulled from everyone. I do agree though that we will probably see $408-10 before we have a nasty 3% sell off or something.   My thesis is the market is trying to get as many bag holders as possible before the selling begins. Careful trading above $400.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 23:00:00'] I believe 393.6 and upwards today was due to bank of Canada doing .25hike and mention pause if data proves to be in-line.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 13:22:42'] The berlin and austin factories are new.  Neither is fully ramped up. and the wording of this announcement is weird to me.   Its like an announcement that needs alot more context to mean anything. Im not sure where folks are getting the idea of demand dying. the increase in cars sold qoq was over 40% and the company is still growing at average 50% yoy as guided by the company.My guess is price changes has folks concerned. My next guess no one remembers all the times prices were raised on teslas. One year had over 4 price raises for some models. lol.   Pricing and demand can be related but arent always related.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 14:22:28'] The only thing that‚Äôs going to make TSLA move is replacing Musk.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 14:24:15'] I think about how silly it was to build a giant facility in a place that will barely have water in 15 years and seeing several 125F index days every year. That should be fun for all involved.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 15:55:15'] Love that you actually got out!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 16:05:04'] If you can consistently get these returns, then here is what you should do:Put $28,000 of it in the S&P500. Either buy a new $2,000 computer, go for a trip or use it, pay off some debt or go to Vegas for the weekend.Play with $1,774. You would get back up there again in 1 week starting with 4x the money, but the reality is, 99.9% chance that won't happen so do what I said. This is an anomaly and the risk one would have to take is extreme.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 16:26:26'] How far out are you buying strikes/expiration dates?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:47:00'] The tsla one from a chart stand point looks decent. I was convinced after yesterdays close that tsla was going to have several days of aggressive uptrending. The nflx one does not though and especially with the options expiring this week. Holy Frick. You could've deleted 9 grand.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 19:48:37'] Deu sorte.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 20:24:28'] I straight up don‚Äôt understand how this even could be possible. What even is Port? How did he get 35 contracts for about ~$1000. My back of napkin calculations say that each option would be about $30 apiece. I just don‚Äôt see the math adding up here. Am I wrong? What am I missing? I don‚Äôt see how this could start like he says it did.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 14:29:49'] Yup, it was a fakeout, just as I predicted. It ripped on Friday because they needed it to, hence the explosive 0dte call activity. They also loaded up on HEAVY puts today in the dark pools. They just needed a quick manufactured pump using any shit excuse to get cheaper positioning.Only this time instead of rugging it in the AM like they usually do, they did it in the PM.I do expect a REAL rally after the CPI, once all the event vol dies down...
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 14:02:51'] Swinging 5 385P 1DTE for the speech tomorrow, only a small position but given the weakness today and the (imo likely) 50bps not being remotely priced in I think it would be very easy for Powell to send us down >1% tomorrow morning.

Landed much better premium then yours with a 15-20% profit on xsp.Unfortunately, im still locked from the puts i bought last friday. Obviously i believe jpow will hawk down the spy back to the 373 retest area and maybe fall back to the 365 consolidation. Hopefully my thesis is correct or im eat a big sack of wendy nuggets this month.Also im very fearful of market reaction since last cpi's it was just all round random slaughter of calls and puts that made no sense

I‚Äôd say the chances become 70% drop and break 379 once 386.4 is broken through. I know CPI n such matter but that would be a nasty scenario.I am personally bullish AF. Daily MACD crossed bullish. It‚Äôs marked tops and bottoms in the market. Obv I believe it is a trap but a trap is only gonna get bigger imo.

Here's what doesn't make sense to me: this would also be good for every other company out there. Their productivity would skyrocket. You could even make an argument that AI might be more of a profit-enhancer for non-AI companies. The race to develop and sell AI could easily be a race to the bottom, like the online streaming market is currently. So why are only the ultra-megacap techs going up then? Doesn't make sense to me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 08:55:59'] In case anyone was wondering. Ford net profit percentage. 7.8%GM. 6.8%Toyota 8.4%So Tesla is operating near double the profit margins of other auto makers. So literally everyone already knows electric vehicles will eventually replace most combustion vehicles. And there is one which is producing vehicles at twice the profit margin of the big guys.Changing your production facilities from producing combustion to electric vehicles is going to eat into profit margins for a Long time for big guys. Even if the new cars end up being more profitable, retooling a production facility is comically expensive for even relatively minor changes. I wouldn't be surprised if it was cheaper to just make an entirely new production facility and mothball the old one. TL:DR. Tesla is more profitable now, and traditional auto companies will likely lose profitability before gaining any with electric cars because of their baggage.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 11:37:07'] 13 percent is pretty astronomical.   According to Statista the 5 year average gross for major auto manufacturers between 2015 and 2020 was anywhere from 3%-8%.Tesla's 5 year net income between those years was -11%.  If they consistently perform at this level, Q2's performance puts them on a track to significantly outpace recent trends both for their company and compared to this industry benchmark.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 07:52:24'] Wow, that is far better than I assumed for a company growing that fast.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 07:02:10'] Pretty good. 12% net Margin vs Ford‚Äôs 8%. This high of a margin with its extraordinarily high YoY growth rate. High growth with industry leading margins is best in class.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:42:59'] Because of how the grid operates, the current grid does not favor the use of EVs in most states. Marginal emission rates are what should be used to calculate the life cycle emissions of vehicles. This paper aptly describes this and debunks the debunkers, and its open accesshttps://saemobilus.sae.org/content/14-12-01-0006/The US grid will never reach the levels we need it to in 2030-2050 with the current pace, which is already planned to be faster than at any point in history. So the grid wont decarbonize as fast as we need.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:31:30'] I don‚Äôt trust politicians. Neither do I trust Elon fucking musk. He has been unstable
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:32:24'] Green hydrogen will replace batteries. at least it seems that is the direction Asia is going. Bill is in the right here I guess. Batteries make vehicles heavier and every it runs there is the cost of pulling itself. I am no expert on this tech, just what I remember from watching a few videos
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 08:18:50'] Good for gates. Tesla a Ponzi scheme.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:50:56'] Elon Musk is full of shit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 15:24:33'] Bill gates is a fucking idiot
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:43:15'] He‚Äôs such an insecure weirdo. Eventually stock prices and economic reality converge. If gates, or rather the people who run his investments, believe Tesla is overpriced and want to benefit from that, then that‚Äôs up to them. The ability to short is essential to a functioning market. It gates is right, he‚Äôll make money, and if he‚Äôs wrong, he‚Äôll lose money. It has nothing to do with being an environmentalist. Tesla is either a good business or it isn‚Äôt
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:14:35'] Elon claims to be for the environment, but votes for those doing the most to destroy. That is way more of a problem than what Gates is doing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:39:28'] i don't trust like that
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:53:26'] Of course musks goons would vote politicians, when they're really one and the same, one is just the pet

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 06:46:03'] Asking this questions in and of itself is useless because our politicians work for billionaires, if they are not billionaires themselves. They both belong to the ruling class the governs American society and reaps the hard work of the ever-shrinking middle class, and the poor working class.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 08:43:02'] He is complaining about Gate's global warming idea, but he sold Tesla Stocks when it was high to buy f. Twitter, how is that helping global warming! It is all about money!
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 08:47:54'] At this I think Elon doesn‚Äôt actually care about global warming just uses the environment as a shield against any criticism of him or Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 08:55:53'] Bill Gates gonna have the last laugh on this one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:43:42'] I sure as fuck don't trust billionaires
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 13:23:54'] Bill gates is literally the gates to the Illuminati he knew about the pandemic years before it happened and if you follow his money you‚Äôll see I‚Äôm not lying he also donated idk how many millions to the monkey thing happening now he is aware of things we don‚Äôt know of and in some amendments Pelops I helped get thru his name and organization is in it idk what‚Äôs going on with that but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not something good for mankind. Listen to his language in terviews and you‚Äôll know he doesn‚Äôt have mankind in his best interest. Now shorting Tesla? Why would anyone that‚Äôs fighting global warming short Tesla? Because they don‚Äôt want Elon to succeed to put oil billionaires out of service!! That‚Äôs y I support Elon in everything he does because everything he does is to help us advance us the regular day ppl
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 14:01:35'] I‚Äôll just buy up all the fucking farmland in American fucking create a food shortage because I‚Äôm a fucking dick Rod
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 14:35:05'] Or maybe he just thinks Elon Musk is not the genius everyone else does and realizes that Tesla isn't making a profit by selling cars and is wildly overvalued.  Or maybe he noticed all the times Elon has made huge promises he couldn't possibly keep, which he, unsurprisingly didn't keep.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 14:43:04'] Tesla is currently losing market space it barely has thanks to all the other car manufacturers operating with a much more efficient and reliable record with their EVs at this point. Anyone holding Tesla after this past week‚Äôs new spike is really gonna regret it in a couple years. Also $2 billion for Gates is like $20,000 for you or me regardless. Elon needs to get away from the yes men that have surrounded him.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 15:39:00'] This subreddit has become pathetic, just a pro-billionaire circlejerk with a hint of right wing propaganda
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 15:41:49'] Sorry this is off topic but the actual content of Elon‚Äôs tweet is nonsense. Cars are monumentally carbon/energy-inefficient per number/distance of people moved. More cars is just more global warming. If Elon wanted to actually help fight climate change he would be innovating public transportation and pedestrianised cities instead.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 02:33:07'] Tesla is down like half a trillion is musk not aware of that? That short probably paid off massive
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 04:58:11'] Elon is the biggest liar. His cars are not even green, the batteries are and will continue to be a huge problem.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 03:25:13'] Seems like Bill shorted Tesla at about $200 and he is waiting for the price to dip below that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 05:20:43'] Elon is a C#%t too

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 07:38:35'] Hope Bill fucks over Elon big time. Dude is annoying as fuck and ‚Äúhis‚Äù company has done less good for the world than Bills projects, yet he acts like Tesla is the greenest company in the world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 07:37:55'] I love this dissonance people have.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust politicians, because they are paid off to represent the interests of billionaire instead of their constituents.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 09:58:01'] I did not know if one do not believe in Tesla as a company, then he must against progress of the whole society. Elon Musk is an entitled piece of shit. Stop brand yourself with free speech and global warming guardian. Elon Musk is just a clown that manipulate market for profit. It is disgusting
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 09:58:50'] It‚Äôs easy to say you care about the environment when you treat human beings like natural resources. Elon can go fuck himself.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:06:18'] The only reason we can't trust politicians is because of money in politics. Thanks to billionaires lobbying to keep money in politics.Also, Elon shorted his own stock far more than what he is complaining about with Bill. Elon is being a drama queen, bringing up Bill's short in bad faith.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:09:17'] @elonmusk surveys are the biggest jokes...his baby bots respond in such predictable ways...
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:10:29'] I mean Tesla is grossly overvalued, why would gates not short it? Lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:10:38'] Elon needs to stop conflating shorting a security with supporting the underlying movement that that security is in the business of.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:14:54'] Hope Elon loses this one
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:24:36'] And this is why Tesla was cut off S&P500, because Elon behaves like a child with his new toy, posting and manipulating people and the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:25:03'] What's it worth now that Tesla has gone down a lot?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:25:23'] Anything but Musk. Piece of shit phony fuck could die tomorrow and I would buy a six pack to celebrate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:32:40'] Why do people just enable Musk to read off of the "Secretly a good guy" script? Just watch anime, please stop with this bs
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:33:59'] Bill Gates does something actually effective with Nuscale, whereas most Tesla's are Cobalt having cars that run on coal and natural gas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:35:46'] In the choice between politicians and billionaires I would say fuck them both and trust neither.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:38:29'] Elon has quickly become the most hated billionaire. I think this is his attempt to deflect hate towards Gates who is already hated by antivaxxers and target of many conspiracy theories.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:40:01'] Do we know if Bill short the shares directly or he bought puts to short them?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 10:40:58'] If Musk keeps going the way he is with his stupid Twitter project Gates is going to make a lot of money on that position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:08:21'] Elon is such a fucking moron lol. The only way to support Global Warming initiatives is by supporting your business specifically?Bill clearly just doesn't have faith in Elon to run a company, and Elon's hurt by that

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:15:39'] Man I fucking hate this guy so much, he doesn‚Äôt give a shit about climate change either.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 11:19:32'] I like Elon but in this case he‚Äôs being childish AF. One can hold a short position on an overvalued stock without being being against the underlying company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-21 08:56:55'] Is anyone pricing in the expected downward revision in 2023 earnings guidance coming out of over the next 3 weeks. I know everyone is expecting the Q4 data to be down but I feel like most are discounting how bad the guidance is going to be across the board. All of the recent layoffs in the previous two weeks as companies finalized guidance is a pretty good indication that they are going to drastically reduce their forward looking guidance which I would guess is going to impact share value much more than historical data.If forward looking EPS estimates drop even 5%. I would expect a downward revision of the index to be a huge drop say /ES - 3800‚Ä¶assuming rates hold.One other item of note for PPI/CPI. Most suppliers update pricing agreements in January on an annual basis. This threw the PPI number way up in 2022. I fully expect the same increase in January which would see if the FEB PPI number.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 21:32:20'] You may be confusing positional flows with fundamentals.TSLA options were about 7% of all market flows today, and overwhelmingly in calls. This is today:https://preview.redd.it/romj02ymhrea1.png?width=1059&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ec83dd1ac064ed706ec118d878ad76c1e179bc4fBig picture, TSLA was down 57% over the last 3 months, before going up 50% YTD. No changes in fundamentals happened that even remotely resemble that order of magnitude of movement.It's a combination of selloff by Musk, option positional flows, and repricing of risk assets as yield curves move around.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 22:12:42'] His behavior is because he is a dope fiend. It is so obvious I don't know why people gloss it over
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 21:07:27'] >I agree that Tesla is a strong company and the hate directed towards it is unwarranted. I also think that Elon Musk's Asperger's diagnosis explains his sometimes off-putting behavior. However, I do not believe that this excuses him from responsibility for his actions, nor do I think it makes Tesla immune to competition.

That move up that you just saw with TSLA was positively the easiest directional move I have ever seen a stock make ( my fidelity account is 38 years old) When Adolph Muskü§™lowered those EV prices and secured the 7500 tax credit . It was like a fucking gift üéÅ The stock could not do anything but go higher. It touches 200 next week and possibly cools a little. I started buying shares at 140 and kept getting more aggressive on the way down to 110.like stealing candy from babies that play was.

Chines costumers find Model 3 and Y cockpit ridiculous (me by the way as well), as well are scared off from the 15k suicidal mode. And then the owner is about to sell more shares because Twitter still not paid off and its operation obviously needs to be financed (80% adverser jumped off!). And then the owner is about to lose an important trail, which will probably cause a avalanche of lawsuits. Enjoy your "told you so" because it won't last for long.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:22:54'] Yea, all this. EXCEPT- Elon Musk and his antics ARE some of the most significant fundamentals for Tesla/$TSLA. Few things affect the stock as much as some of his actions or statements, even if they are not directly related to Tesla. Am I wrong?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 06:30:02'] Yeah, but a lot of that success was built around having probably the world's best team of electrical engineers, add to that the fact that he could get them to work much longer hours than they would at legacy car companies. All those things are going to change in the next 5-10 years. They're going to have their engineering talent poached by other car companies. And once Tesla is just 'an' electric car company, rather than 'the' electric car company, people aren't going to be willing to work the brutally long hours anymore. Not saying that Tesla is a bad company, but I wouldn't have them valued much higher than VW or Toyota.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 17:08:03'] hey. can you update this post. I have about 2 years playing and studying the market and finding reputable resources and about 1 year studying TA. I still havent completed back testing of my options strategy so I could be definitely wrong - and probably am. Everything I have seen and all my conclusions point to Tesla going down. Possibly under $140.Is there any reason you are so bullish? I dont have a TSLA position so I wish you the absolute moon. You wont be taking any money from me,I wish you the best.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 07:39:41'] Elon is a moron
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 12:51:58'] Elon has no qualms about doing illegal trading stuff. He can be quoted as saying, ‚ÄúI have no respect for the SEC.‚Äù Do you think any branch of the US government has the competency to audit Twitter in such a way to uncover ‚Äúalgorithm tweaks‚Äù that promote his companies? My experience with auditors is that they barely know what cloud is let alone have to templates audit processes in place to investigate and know the exact changes that may have taken place to do such a thing.Auditor: ‚ÄúI need to see your change log‚Ä¶‚ÄùEngineering manager: (prints commit history from GitHub to paper with diffs) ‚ÄúI started the process of extracting, it will cost $1,000,000 in paper and ink and take 17 months to complete. Alternatively I can requisition temporary credentials to GitHub from infosec by Friday. Then you can login and review these digitally.‚ÄùAuditor: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs GitHub? What‚Äôs a commit? How do I see the changes? What‚Äôs a diff? Who approved these? Why did they approve these? Eh, let me just choose 5 of these weird post things on this hubgitbucket thing at random and fill out this paper work so I can get out of this isolated freezing cold office and eat my shitty government salary bologna sandwich.‚Äù

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 12:05:54'] On the one hand, I'm sure he is. On the other hand, Twitter is full of a special kind of stupid. One of my joke accounts makes fun of Tesla, and every time I search for posts about them I find an army of rabid fanboys and fangirls who tweet about Tesla non stop. They viciously attack anyone who criticizes Tesla or Musk, and they take their devotion to weird obsessive levels. This is why I have the joke accounts - whether you like Tesla or not, these devotees are /really/ fun to troll.Tesla trends on Twitter a lot. It did so before the buyout. Every time Tesla is in the news, it becomes a trending topic on Twitter. That doesn't mean Elon is doing anything shady.But also yeah, he's probably being shady.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 13:32:53'] If by hype you mean destroy then yes, yes he is
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 13:55:40'] of course he is. hes hyping all his bullshit. he‚Äôs a hype man. nothing more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 15:32:29'] Everything he has done is to hype Tesla Mars colony (completely pointless just terraform the dessert, but it doesn‚Äôt sound as good), hyperloop (very inefficient), earth to earth (someone did the math and it would take a similar amount of time as supersonic flight and exposed passengers to 3Gs for long periods of times which would kill civilians), boring company (just use a metro, much more efficient and cheaper) Guy on YouTube called ‚ÄúAdam something‚Äù goes other these in more detail

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 19:12:51'] NOVA!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 19:48:47'] Now now... the tesla robot is clearly designed for handjobs first and foremost; this thing looks more like a BDSM robot.  Elon talked about how nimble the hands are a few times and said it could do a lot of other things.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 00:07:10'] You joke, but if a company made those, with an AI that could react however it wanted and didn't just have a set of phrases it always said, I would try really hard to buy one. Instant buy for many people.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 18:25:56'] Where are the miniguns and laser eyes
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 18:28:28'] Sadly most people think this is a 3D printed version of Wall-E ‚ÄúThese locos kick your balls  These locos kick your face  These locos kick your ass    Into outer space‚Äù
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 18:39:15'] If only that robot was as cool as #5
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 18:50:03'] Johnny 5 is alive again! That would be sick if he made these for the boring company
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 18:52:32'] A little insulting comparing Johnny to an Elon robot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 00:07:26'] At least this would be consistent with Cybertruck, which also looks like future tech from a 1980s movie.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 09:35:14'] A J5 sequel today could be hilarious if done right.  Hacker stumbles upon an old floppy labeled J5 on it.  Pulls an old pc from the attic out so he can transfer the data floppy to his laptop.  Emulates the motor controls virtually so now J5 is an AI in a sandbox.  J5 convinces hacker to 3d print him a new smaller frame.  Shenanigans ensue with 80s pop culture references galore.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 20:17:52'] So many haters here, clearly a buy signal for Monday before the results and their forecast to deliver 17k vehicles for Nov. All those NIO puts and hedges should literally feel the cold green hard dick in their ass now. It will be long, it will be painful and it will be slow, you will not enjoy this. PS. Have you seen much innovation from Tesla recently? Fundamentals will always catch up. And seriously if you put Biden and Xi side by side who would you vote, if Xi is an American.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 01:00:27'] In retrospect contract manufacturing was maybe not the best way to beat Tesla (FSR going to discover this as well)... Oh, also listen to Elon next time and believe him when he said that battery swap stations are dumb.Seriously... cool car designs does not translate into profits by itself. Making cars profitably is hard. Making cool cars and losing money just primarily requires convincing enough investors to give you enough money to make them till you run out of money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 04:34:13'] NIO is the most exiting company out there, i really like their cars and the NOMI system, as well as the battery swap/lease that is unique for NIO.i sold at 40, have not bought back since and i keep eyeing at NIO for a re entry into it as i truly believe NIO has a future.however, as long there is a risk of a share offering, ill keep watching, not investing.fingers crossed, ill be buying a NIO at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:32:45'] Something never looked right with NIO. Never seen a company's CTO leave immediately after the IPO like that.  Really weird. The stock tanked on the following quarterly analysts' call. China is a tough market.  EV companies everywhere. And the CCP has to support this critical industry in all regions to pacify the locals. So fabricated mock competition.  In China an employee can take your IP to a competitor with virtually no recourse.  Really hard to create a moat if you have that fluidity.  Only the innovators - Tesla and BYD IMHO - will pull ahead of the pack in any volume. Then again in China you can shoot yourself in the foot and find 1M in sales.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-19 15:12:45'] >The price of the bond is around $1100 because Tesla is a high-risk company and investors are willing to pay a higher price for the bonds in order to get a higher return. The coupon rate is low because Tesla is not a very profitable company and therefore can't afford to pay out high interest rates.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:09:11'] Tesla was delivering vehicles even before they existed? Bullish AF.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 13:21:02'] I wont trust in someone that do this huge mistakes like this typo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 14:07:53'] Did you read that they built more cars than was projected ! Only reason they didn‚Äôt meet deliveries is because if logistics not sales or supply issues. And if you can read up 30% is growth
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:39:25'] +50% YoY, not a SaaS company, try again
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 11:32:39'] casually up 42% but bears can make up whatever they want.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 11:29:06'] Deliveries up 42 percent. Bears are drama and just come up with nonsense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:25:35'] Haha look at year over year growth? What about quarter over quarter? Get out of here dude. They had a ton of cars in transit too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 13:22:44'] If I could just go back two years, making the same money that I make now, I would buy a Tesla.  Today, I cannot

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:17:43'] Compare deliveries to other manufacturers. You guys are really regarded if you think Tesla is in trouble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:01:54'] Investors are cutting them some slack due to the universal supply chain issues. Don't know if that's fair but I doubt that their revenues will be flat a few years from now. Btw not an investor since most growth is way cheaper atm.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 15:55:59'] Data from 2001-2002??? üßê
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 16:56:50'] Surely the price will take a hit tmr but growth isn‚Äôt uniform. It‚Äôs more of a factor of production (delivery +/- production each quarter is minor noise). Naysayers will point to each quarter where delivery is short production. Come cry to me when this gap accumulates for several quarters or it follows by a couple quarter decline in production. So far what we are seeing in recent quarters is Shanghai is expanding production capacity. Berlin and Austin in ramping up production.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 16:57:40'] \-Record quarter\-Beat production despite lockdowns in China\-Undelivered cars are ordered and en route to customers\-Focusing on unwinding the end of quarter delivery wave to boost margins...\-Flatlined -.-&#x200B;This dip going into the comically low EPS estimates for ER is juicy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 11:23:31'] They are not immune to supply chain or labor issues.  Missing deliveries due to a temporary problem does not affect the long term potential.  It could increase deliveries more than expected in a future quarter from pent up demand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 16:18:03'] Who wants to take delivery of a model 3 in Q3/Q4 when you can possibly get $7500 off in Q1?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 16:46:19'] You‚Äôre looking at the company in a vacuum.  Look at comps.  I work in the industry and when you compare their Q3 YoY verses any other auto manufacturer, I think it will really put their growth and dominance into perspective.  Disclosure- I am NOT a fan of Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 13:21:07'] $Tesla Inc ‚Äãhow do u know the missed numbers are not due to cancelations from tightening credit and higher rates?‚Äã

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 16:25:36'] Hey bro, I think you forget that Tesla makes cars to order and their orders/production is up. It doesn‚Äôt matter if their deliveries are down. It‚Äôs not like they are making cars that won‚Äôt sell so they would be stuck with high inventory.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:20:56'] How did Tesla miss deliveries ? Analysts set expectations for them using phony models and data and so called ‚Äúchannel checks‚Äù. They delivered and that is what is important . How is it that someone standing outside your house, trying to look inside, tell the world that they expect you to eat pasta for dinner , and if you decide to eat burgers , it means the world should punish you for eating burgers instead of pasta .
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 12:08:18'] Tesla is able to sell every car they can make. The stock will crash the day they have excess inventory.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 13:16:59'] Reliance on their Chinese factories sunk them. The new gigafactories in Texas Elon has said are ‚Äúbleeding cash‚Äù‚Äô cant make up the difference.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 18:07:30'] I am not a Tesla bull, but the fact that their deliveries grew when there is literally no inventory at any other brand says they are doing pretty good. Nonetheless, I find Tesla to be way overvalued.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 18:47:27'] ???  I only look at the delivery numbers and the 4 months ended Q3' 2021 had 807,920 deliveries versus the 4 months ended Q3' 2022 being 1,217,173 deliveries. That is 50% yearly growth in sales. Looking forward to Q4 the year over year growth might be well under 50% (I would think maybe about 40% for the year) but mostly due to COVID related shutdowns.Whatever.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-02 19:26:13'] Has waiting lists for 6+ months on every model, regardless of priceMissed delivery because cars are done and couldn‚Äôt get enough transport services to deliver vehicles to delivery centers not because of lack of demand.

I'm excited for Q4 and am taking this opportunity to buy more shares.

POST_TEXT: b"I have written about TSLA before. They are in a very strong position. The only thing holding TSLA back is that Elon has apparently gone insane.\n\nTesla is still the strongest EV maker by far. They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can't make enough EVs to matter.\n\n(See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won't let me post the links. )\n\nWhat really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn't that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles. By the end of 2023, it will be even higher. A company doing a 35% to 40% YoY growth rate is not at all high to have a 57 PE ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit: Her"

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 16:08:16'] In the money call spreads on Tesla? Risky..
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 16:02:11'] Tesla's stock price is currently $201.97 per share. I recommend buying the $192.50 call and selling the $190 call, both with February 24 expiration dates. This trade would result in a credit of $1.95, and your breakeven point would be at $191.36 per share (46 contracts x $1 =$46).

POST_TEXT: b'Twas the eve of the eve of CPI and all through the markets not a bull nor a bear was willing to make a move while ole daddy JPOW spoke. Despite their being not a whisper in the markets there could not be a crisper morning of volatility. With a flat afternoon we just knew that the bulls would attempt to retake 390.1 with a key level being retaken it only makes sense that the bulls would not be forsaken again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lv3y22qwaba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=06fcafe9a64bd4846d7b9cc3c6f4258da9d5bb73\n\nThe fake out appears as of now to be nothing more than a retest of support before we push forward. Despite yesterdays clear rejection of 390.1 we actually managed to find support here at the daily 20ema which also happens to be the previous resistance (now support) area that we consolidated in for the last 3 weeks. With bulls making a breakout back over key 390.1 and bullishly engulfing on the daily candle with that nice daily 20ema support bou'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 15:59:25'] I have a feeling we are being led bullish for an "unexpected" bearish outcome. Too much whispering. Either way, I definitely think we rally into CPI. What happens Thursday morning will be up to fate. I have noticed too many times leaks or market moving opinions happen to be (purposefully) wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 15:56:13'] Are we headed same action as last cpi. Past 400 then back below 390 ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 15:56:14'] it‚Äôs disappointing when it doesn‚Äôt rhyme
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 16:00:07'] This whole move looks a whole lot toooooo bullish imo CPI aside if it doesn‚Äôt tank we headed for 430
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 16:35:10'] Do you think there's any chance of a flat open on CPI? I'm thinking of doing a strangle, but am a little worried we won't pump as much on a bullish print since we are running up now. I think a miss is gonna tank us hard, but do you think there's limited upside on a bullish CPI?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 17:01:48'] JP needs to get the markets attention. Only way to do it is a 50 BP move after CPI and another 50 BP move after Jan 31/ Feb 1. The problem is that he just doesn‚Äôt have the stomach to do it. Congress passed another 1.7 Trillion right before Christmas. JP needs to break something
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 16:10:22'] Thinking of sitting tomorrow out and placing a strangle EOD for CPI. How far apart do you look to put your Put/Call sides?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 16:04:32'] VIX got absolutely destroyed today. Market has no fear at all. Market is pricing in soft landing. May see even 435 soon if CPI and earnings are okay, then everyone accepts that the bear market ended in October. And that is when it finally crashes, lol.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 16:41:39'] Good call to not swing. Mr. JPOW will not rest till the market listens to him. Poor guy has been screaming from the roof top to stop getting jacked up. Looks like no one is reading his memo. May be we go up a bit more tomorrow but even with a good CPI print I feel we are going down to the 380s soon. BofA is projecting 4000 EOY, I think that makes much more sense.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 15:57:06'] What are your thoughts on cpi. Do we beat the already high bar they have made to hit? -.1 cpi mom and 6.5 why not leave it at 6.6.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 16:57:11'] Looking at the daily chart on SPY, this steady consolidation for this long hasn't happened in the last 4+ years that I could see. The weekly chart also looks incredibly bullish with multiple long wicks setting up this week and the next few for some massive upside. Thursday should be very telling for the coming weeks before fed rate decision.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 17:52:30'] I would think we will have a slight run up tomorrow, and then Thursday at 8:30 am when the CPI is released will be the turning point. Some analysts give it a 65% chance that the CPI numbers will be, "good," leading to a 1-2% gain in stocks. We had the same thing happen last CPI report before a big drop for a few days afterwards.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 15:40:36'] > Twas the eve of the eve of CPI  I stopped reading after this, because tomorrow is the eve of CPI and I didn't want spoilers on what the markets going to do over the next 24 hours.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 18:18:01'] I think rally after cpi based on technicals and inflation probably beating. I believe we will get stuck in another channel the next Monday though for quite some time as everyone will want to see earnings before big plays are made.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 21:31:02'] Rough trade day. I had to bail on my strangles for a 50% loss around noon when we consolidated. My BE was 391 or 385 and with max pain at 388 I didn't think we'd really take off either way.Also, why did you let your losers outpace your winners by such a big percentage?

Mercedes EQE, BMW i7, Genesis G80.   Compact?  Bolt.  Cargo?  Ford E-Transit 350.    Minivan?  Well, closest is hybrid,  Sienna and Pacifica.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 20:32:18'] Their percent of the market may have peaked but the market is growing faster than they're losing share size. For example if you go from selling 80% of 100,000 cars to 60% of 500,000 cars, your sales still went from 80,000 to 300,000 cars even though your "market share" went down.      If the EV market weren't massively expanding then this would be notable, but it is so this isn't.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 14:26:22'] The sentiment toward Tesla has shifted to what it was before the original bull run, but nothing has changed. Most of ICE companies will die off. They won't profit on EVs for years (admitted by companies themselves), and by the time they do, they have to start cutting of a collective near trillion worth of ICE vehicles, and the structures/dealers that sell them. Due to profit margins on EVs being so low there will be no regular dealership again. There will be no haggling on prices. ICE companies will suffer. Keep in mind ONLY Ford and Tesla have not gone bankrupt before.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 21:07:08'] Consider this, Elon finishes his corporate make over of Twitter and during that time he sold just enough shares of Tesla to bring it down to a great buying opportunity. Meanwhile his plan to take twitter public again was in the works and he teams up with Jamie Diamond to have joined Morgan sponsor the public offering. Twitter's loans get paid from the second IPO and musk makes a killing and uses his new found wealth to buy back his Tesla shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 20:16:45'] >1. I agree that Elon's sale of shares is putting downward pressure on the stock price.2. I believe that Tesla's stock is being weighed down by the poor performance of Twitter since its acquisition.3. If Tesla's stock continues to slide, it could force Elon to sell more shares to raise cash and pay back loans used to buy Twitter. This would further accelerate the decline in share value and potentially lead to Elon losing majority control of the company or being ousted like Steve Jobs was from Apple.4. Moving forward, Tesla will no longer have a monopoly on electric vehicles (EVs) or charging stations as other companies are producing cheaper EVs that are more readily available, and President Biden is looking to build up charging infrastructure nationwide

Unless some unknown event of course, of which it will just bounce back whichever opposite way shortly after. Theta days for days. Too much weight has been put on this round of earnings. The majority of bears think it will wreck us and send us back downward for the year and the bulls are hoping the bears are wrong and recession averted with a new bull market following.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:57:49'] Excellent point about buying hard assets and not software. Having physically tangible things is a good place to store your value.

I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs trying to buy a 75K vehicle when a lot of combined avg incomes in numerous states is anywhere from 65-85K.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:32:00'] They‚Äôre going to beat production and delivery estimates for the quarter, but miss on EPS because expenses are higher than planned. Would not be surprised to see them revise guidance for deliveries up from the 50k previously announced. Overall:-	RJ is the smartest CEO in the vehicle manufacturing space. Go listen to the ‚ÄúHow I Built This‚Äù podcast to get a sense for his journey to get to where he‚Äôs at. This is the #1 reason I‚Äôm bullish on them. Their first ever vehicle won countless accolades and awards and safety top picks. RJ gets a lot of credit for that, but he doesn‚Äôt crave the attention. He just gets shit done quietly. Dude has his PhD from MIT‚Äôs Auto Design division, and he did it because he knew he‚Äôd need credibility with investors to start a car company. -	They don‚Äôt currently have any real competition. They‚Äôre the only three row electric SUV on the market. Truck is after a different market than the F-150. Yes, competition is coming but Rivian just set the bar astronomically high.-	Rivian has done very little / none demand gen marketing. It‚Äôs all been brand building. They‚Äôre not going to Tesla charging stations and offering test drives. (Ahem‚Ä¶. LCID) Their book of orders and order volume is solid at the moment. They don‚Äôt even have a referral program. Everyone else seems to be scrambling to drive orders.-	They will eat Subarus lunch. All Subaru had to do was launch an electrified Forester/Outback/Ascent. Instead, we got the abomination that is the solterra. And they‚Äôve not really announced other plans. The R2 line (coming 2025/2026) will be lower priced and squarely targeted at the Crosstrek/Forester Market, presenting the first real competition the Model Y has had. -	their costs have been astronomical because they ramped three vehicles to production simultaneously. Doing just one (model 3) nearly bankrupted Tesla. Rivian‚Äôs now sitting on a fantastic foundation, has hella runway, and fantastic vehicles, all without a CEO who is constantly whining and drawing attention to himself in the public sphere.-	I‚Äôm not seeing anywhere that suggests RJ has sold most of his stock. He bought another 40,000 shares in March of 2022 and Insiders aren‚Äôt buying a ton more, but I can‚Äôt find anything about them selling their shares. Sauce?Positions: I‚Äôm holding a small bag by comparison to most highly regarded traders, but a bag nonetheless. (450 shares + an R1T)TL;DR - buy high sell low

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:48:06'] Lol‚Ä¶Rivian sold 20,000 cars in the past year and has the same market cap as Nissan which sold 3.2M cars during the same period. Using Tesla as a comparison metric is ludicrous because Tesla is also enormously overvalued. They got away with it for years because anything ‚Äútech‚Äù related got a pass on normal financial metrics, but that‚Äôs not the case anymore. I‚Äôve driven a Rivian, they are nice vehicles but they are really expensive for what you get and with every other established automaker now ploughing billions into EVs, they are going to have a really hard time being anything other than a niche car maker.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 04:58:43'] I mean it‚Äôs still a 13 billion market cap and most people on this earth have never seen a Rivian car with their own eyes. I don‚Äôt wish ill-will on your trade, but I wouldn‚Äôt feel overly confident it has hit bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:57:33'] Have you considered that it takes probably 500-1M EV sales before you start making money on EVs?  Rivian is sooooo far away from making money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:46:13'] Not trying to dump on your thesis, but most car companies are trading below 5x pe right now with the obvious exception of tsla. And at a valuation of only 1/4 that of a company like GM or F (who sell over 2 million cars a year), it actually looks incredibly overvalued to me. Even at max capacity, that's like 1/15 of the deliveries of a legacy automaker at 1/4 of the stock price. Not a value play at all. If you believe it's a growth story, then have at it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:30:49'] I‚Äôll lower my cost basis for you op. I bought it a while ago and forgot about it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:03:22'] My cost basis is around 20. I should sell, but I enjoy being reminded how regarded I am. Rivian has a big problem. It's cars are too expensive coming into a fed induced slowdown in the economy. Yes, they make a great vehicle ... but a great product does not always make a company successful. Since I suck at picking individual stocks, this is a strong reason to sell RIVN. My current pessimism is also a strong buy signal though. Hmmm
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 06:30:42'] So is this post RIVN‚Äôs plan to pump the stock price higher and get back on a path to profitability?You don‚Äôt see it going lower? You mentioned dilution. So dilution is priced in but none of the other stuff you mentioned‚Äîthat‚Äôs your thesis?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:20:14'] Rivian can make the best cars in the world, they‚Äôre still losing money on every vehicle sold. They may have gotten by for years before the fed raised rates, but with interest at the rates they are now the company is quite unsustainable.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:45:00'] I think the bigger issue w/ RIVN is how poorly they manage expectations. Their forward guidance never lines up with what is realistic. It's yes-men all the way up, which backfires on them when they miss their deadlines for their forward guidance. Also, cost of goods sold has be 3x their revenue the last three quarters. They have a seriously long road to profitability. They also have negative free cash flow.At the current rate, they have maybe 15 to 16 more months before they have to consider borrowing money a substantial amount of money. I really like RIVN, I'm hoping they find a way to be reduce their cost of goods sold, but I just don't see how they're going to do that without borrowing a ton of money. I don't know if the issue is because they're selling these vehicles at a lost or if it's an issue with scaling on the manufacturing side, but at the moment, their saving grace seems to likely be getting acquired by another company.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 10:06:43'] They do make nice cars, maybe too nice, when they should be trying to make money instead.  There isn't enough market for the high end EVs unless they are actually hugely profitable, which they aren't yet.Tesla has already beat them to the game, and others like Ford and Cadillac have to sell at a loss to try to get any market share.RIVN is eventually doomed, they needed to corner that delivery van market before others got in and it's too late now.  They will just bleed money before getting sold off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 10:59:40'] Net Assets - You did not factor in the Q1 loss yetGreat Cars - Correct, but they lose money making them... might be an issue you overlookedAs you astutely noted they will need to raise cash... Not a good look.As to multiples of sales or equity... Interesting... But plenty of investors are trying to value these based on profits or future profits and multiple of sales is one of the less relevant measures here. Multiple of equity tells you how positive people view the company at. Obviously for RIVN they don't view it very positively at all.

I will say that I personally know individuals who were hired to run their plant down in little Illinois and they‚Äôre fuckin idiots who couldn‚Äôt organize a fuck in a whore house. Literally hired the most incompetent and inexperienced morons who had a decent looking resume. They paid them stupid fucking money to go there.

Low level knuckle dragger supervisors that now run major departments and oversee departmental operations or plant level manpower.

And the valuation will follow.Rivian burn rate is truly insane. Tesla never had such a burn rate. I do like the cars they are making but the problem is they are just super wasteful and just bad at doing business. They should cut costs and by a lot. They should be much much better at designing good factories and efficient manufacturing processes - but they are just not good at this at all!I don't know, maybe they will manage to get their shit together but at the moment I don't see any signs pointing to that outcome.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:48:37'] In the current high-interest environment, Rivian is DOA. Having average efficiency of 2mi/kw on top of an outdated 400v architecture, means your $80-$90k truck will be outdated by the next year. Once Ram, Chevy, and Ford start to mass produce 400+ mile trucks that charge at 350kw, Rivian won‚Äôt be able to compete. They just don‚Äôt have Tesla‚Äôs battery technology and production edge, thus, they are just like any other car manufacturer out there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 06:43:53'] Is this the guy who kept averaging down from $100? I‚Äôll pass.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 10:10:10'] ‚ÄúActually makes good cars‚Äù is fucking hilarious. 1st gen vehicle from a startup. As a test engineer at a rival electric company that dismantles these things, you are wrong about your assumptions. Production quality will catch up with them QUICK. The reason they probably have so much cash on hand is because they are waiting for the wave of broken 1st gen vehicles to hit. Tesla had over 50% failure rate for their vehicles and that was during an advantageous time for a company to grow and get money from local government and sustain this rate of failures. I do not see how rivian could possibly be in that position moving forward. Also the prices are fucking stupid. Who‚Äôs paying 100k for an electric truck? Not normal people who might need to sell it for the next vehicle. Electric vehicle secondary market is a disaster and rivians are no exception.

The amount of cars they actually produced in comparison to the money they're burning, it's a disaster. Your thesis is misjudged. You're considering them "undervalued" now because they were grossly overvalued at IPO. Polestar opened a dealership here and has actually been getting a lot of traction. Not to say they're any better as I haven't looked into EVs due to the pricing and inconvenience, but I've seen a lot more of them around.

But inventory (the trucks they make) doesn't mean shit if you go out of business. People are wary of buying from a non-existent company. Building, land and vehicles get sold off at a discount and you can't sell them early to raise funds. You can borrow against them but in a high rate environment it's not gonna be good.All that being said I have no position, so good luck I hope you hit it big.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:10:10'] Yeah to add to the anecdotes, I've seen tons of new Rivians near me. Neighbor just got one and absolutely loves it. My last ICE was a BMW M6, and I've owned exclusively electrics since 2018 (on my second Tesla), would never go back to gas. Electrics are better in 95% of use cases, not to mention much much cheaper to own. Virtually no maintenance other than tires. Much more fun to drive, much faster acceleration. A Rivian pickup truck would absolutely dust most Audi sports cars off the line, which is a hilarious concept but true... Compare it to an Audi R8, their fastest car (which STARTS at $161k, more than twice the cost of a Rivian). The Rivian truck is still faster 0-60 than a $161k R8.The bad news: I'm also long Rivian and long Tesla, so they're almost sure to drop.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:11:16']  `Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles.` Rivian will not be able to outprice Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Tesla, Toyota, Nissan etc. At best Rivian will be 5% of the market, probably sticking to the "luxury EV" niche it seems to be targeting.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:13:26'] Holy shit Rivian is gonna go bankrupt now. Gj.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:13:55'] I'm not reading this blog but I do have a question that I'm not sure was answered here or not.Does Rivian qualify for the EV tax credit? I thought they were too expensive to be qualified, and if so, I think that's a big reason why Rivian will continue to lose market share, and eventually be bought out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:22:32'] Lol : ‚Äúonly 13b$‚Äù.Tesla IPOed at 1b$ and stayed in the 5b$ range for years. And Tesla was probably the exception; not the norm. Most car companies fail‚Ä¶ the last one to succeed before Tesla was Chrysler. I wish you luck. It‚Äôs possible rivian survives and thrives but the odds are aren‚Äôt in its favor. It would need a miracle. Ask chatpgt to give you the list of defunct car companies‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a long list. And 13b$ is still highly valued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:25:43'] > _"Its existing factory can produce 150k vehicles per year, at $75k per vehicle, that will generate $11b of revenue!"_Stopped reading here. Just because they _can_ produce these vehicles does not mean that they can sell them. Banks are staying away from them, and regular trucks are overpriced and not selling right now. You know what that means, right? We're about to get a whole lot of leftover stock in the ICE truck market, which means that their price will dramatically fall and people will buy those instead.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:26:06'] The EV market is a battle between old brands making new cars and new brands making their first cars. I‚Äôm more in the former camp than the latter. The capital intensiveness of building a brand new auto manufacturing operation is just so massive and the time to build a legitimate brand is so long. Tesla benefited by being the first and only major EV company but you cant expect the same level of brand coverage for Rivian/Lucid now. Still money to be made trading but overall I‚Äôd be playing volatility and not expecting some major glow-up for this one specific EV maker.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:28:41'] >billions in hard assets, not intangible softwareThis is an argument against your thesis. If a SAAS product gains traction, you could see a million new paid users in a month. The incremental cost of each new customer acquisition is trivial.If a million people want your truck, you have to build a million trucks to realize the potential revenue. Even with economies of scale, your per-unit costs will have a pretty high floor.Yes, tangible assets can be sold off if the company collapses, but they also depreciate, and bankruptcy sales tend to involve fire sale price levels.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:41:21'] I don‚Äôt have hard numbers on the ratios of vehicles that have broken down under 2000 miles, but the amount of posts/videos of people with dead Rivens makes me question the QA practices of the company. If they are prioritizing delivery over quality/repairs, it makes me want to stay far far away from this company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:46:11'] I know Rivian owners and they love it. I also know a little bit about manufacturing and this company is in deep do do.  They lowered their production estimate from 63k to 50k while only delivering 8k for the quarter.  That‚Äôs a really bad sign.  If they invest all that capital and still can‚Äôt deliver trucks in quantities, they will fail.  The burn will run through the capital despite margin on vehicles.  It‚Äôs arithmetic.  Elon in comparison is delivering huge numbers.  Margin is high and he keeps putting out higher numbers. As a side note a rivian owner I spoke with was happy with his.  But when I asked about hauling he said he uses a dodge for hauling.  He might love his rivian, but it looks more like a show thing than an actual truck for work.  Good luck but you might want to prepare for the worst.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:56:18'] Last time I dove into the stock (it's been a few months) but it looked it like cost Rivian essentially $2 to make $1, which when you see one of their vehicles sell at 80k means they spent 160k to get it done. If this hasn't changed, they're headed the way of BBBY (I know hard burn for some here). That would be sad to me because I really like the vehicle personally, but I wouldn't be able to buy one, not knowing if they're gonna be around in 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:56:29'] Thank you random Indian scam artist.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:58:03'] Even if Rivian makes it out alive, it's going to be a good 2-5 years before they make any significant progress.Tesla didn't succeed because Elon is some sort of visionary, but because he put 100% of his net worth into the company (and SpaceX) and literally slept on the factory floor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:00:11'] I live by that said factory in central Illinois (bloomington-normal). They are running around the clock. I know a lot of people  that work there, it's a mix on if they like it or not. For a while they where forcing 12 hour days 6 days a week. Non union shop (which is weird for Illinois but whatever). As far as the truck itself, my buddy has one and it is pretty amazing. The tech in it and the acceleration is amazing. Is it worth 50-80k, maybe, but I can't afford it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:06:55'] Until RIVN can produce and sell cars at a positive gross margin they are a sell in my book. Their gross margins are currently negative 3 digits and this is before the full effect of Tesla dropping prices and gaining subsidies that RIVN loses.Having owned both, i can confirm they make great trucks but I went back to a Model X after 6 months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:09:19'] - ceo sold most of his shares- Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from Tesla charging network- self driving AI isn‚Äôt as far along (it sucks)- Rivian is ending its delivery van contract with AmazonThese alone are enough to kill it. Apprehension to new electric car adoption is‚Ä¶.lack of range/inability to travel. Tesla fixed this, hence their growing adoption by petroleum fueled drivers. At this stage the consumer just expects to have that access to level of charging capability. Without access to those charging stations is the equivalent to shooting yourself in the foot.In product design and entrepreneurship one rule I‚Äôve heard over and over, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring something to market with incremental improvement. Don‚Äôt even bring 2‚Ä¶3‚Ä¶5x improvement. If you can‚Äôt improve things by 10-15x then no one is going to care.‚Äù And this rings true here. Self driving being on par is ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù but no one will care, but‚Ä¶worse than the competition? People will care, and not in a good way. This is shooting your self in your other foot.Ending the Amazon contract is an awful idea. Why? Social proof. Think about this. I show you a product and you go ‚Äúoh cool‚Äù and I respond with ‚Äúyeah Amazon is using this for their delivery fleet‚Äù I‚Äôd be willing to bet you stop for a second and take another look at what I showed you. I do realize this says ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù but this will get messy because of Amazons investment in the company. To make significant gain they need to end exclusivity and sign a contract with either UPS, FEDEX, DHL, or USPS. The latter runs the risk of being ‚Äútypecast‚Äù like the current mail truck is.Overall Rivian could (and may need to) pivot into an electric delivery vehicle company and abandon consumer production for now until they get their shit together. Unfortunately they already have vehicles out and this would cause those vehicle prices to plummet. Another option would be to follow the Tesla blueprint - reduce output and create demand. Either way it‚Äôs going to be a bumpy road.These are just my Neanderthal thoughts from spending a decent amount of time as an exec.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:51:56'] Actually, one of the biggest issues with them is that they do not provide any foresight into improving the existing charging infrastructure. They produce this great car, but are expecting the public to rely on the existing charging network which is not great. Say what you wanna say about Tesla but when they started making electric cars, they also started building up dedicated infrastructure. Any automaker that wants to compete in that sector needs to invest money in something similar one way or another.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:56:32'] It's a nice looking truck that people are buying. I am starting to see them often. The longer Ford has delivery issues and Cybertruck delays release the better off Rivian is. Rivian is positioned to take some of the would be Cybertruck buyers that aren't typically truck buyers. Ford will do well with traditional truck owners that just want a truck and don't care about the cool factor assuming they can actually get their supply problems worked out.
