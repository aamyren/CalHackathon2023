Tesla's cars score the highest of any brand in the EuroNCAP tests nowadays, which are the official European safety tests. If a court calls those cars unsafe, every brand in the world would have to refund their cars.

The company must refund the full purchase price to the plaintiff.June 15, 2023 - 5:11 pm Now shareThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had "actual severe defects". Source: APTesla Model SThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had "actual severe defects".Berlin, Düsseldorf The electric car manufacturer Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered on Monday that Tesla must refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The reason is "serious defects in driving comfort and safety", including unwanted braking.As far as is known, there is no higher court judgment against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The decision of June 12 has 14 pages and reads like a reckoning with the statements that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making about the quality of his driver assistance systems for years, often under the term "Autopilot".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:09:04'] I think tesla is in trouble. They got so big in their early years because the tech in their cars was better than other brands, their electric range was higher than anyone else, and they were the only brand capable of mass producing electric cars to meet demand. This was the reason so many people were overlooking the very clear quality control issues that they have. The most important thing they had to do was solve their QC issues before other brands caught up. However, other brands caught up and tesla still faces terrible QC concerns. This may affect them a lot in the future. Now, other brands have similar or better technology and driving assistance. Everybody has a big screen, a trend that Tesla started.Other brands have developed better autonomous systems than Tesla. Mercedes, GM, and Ford are the top now.Other brands have electric cars that equal or beat Tesla's range and charging speeds.Other brands are able to produce and develop electric cars at a good rate. It can be argued that brands are still catching up in this sense, but they are most definitely catching up at rapid speed.The last current saviour for Tesla is their far superior charging network. This was something that was planned to take ***years*** for other brands to catch up to. However, they are catching up fast. Furthermore, other brands are now gaining access to tesla charging network. This is another nail in the coffin for tesla.Tesla is running out of time to solve their issues. They need to address the issues in their cars before the other brands leave them in the dust. When the other brands have better electric cars that are readily available and affordable, along with good charging networks, tesla will struggle to sell units.

When in fact he's out there personally trying to put out fires due to Tesla FSD and auto pilot being so darn awful official government agencies have to go after him and sit him down like a child who knew full well what he was doing was wrong in the first place, and sit him down and scold him and ground him and give Elon Musk a consequence for his negative behavior. Like a child! lol.The number of times Tesla and Elon Musk have been involved in covering up or reducing the seriousness of the issues and problems regarding the public safety and driver safety with his cars on the road probably should be taken into account at some point once enough accidents/deaths have occurred to make the information seem more prevalent, like what is the difference between a transparent company and Tesla?A transparent company has no secrets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 04:53:23'] My 2c:ESG was always about a new way for funds to market themselves, ultimately with the goal of growing their AUM.In reality, funds are a 'solved' space. ESG ETFs are majorly identical to regular ETFs, but it makes regular investors 'feel good' which is way to collect funds, and institutional investors are able to boast about their investments.Am I just making this up?Well compare ESGU, the ESG etf with 14bn AUM to IVV, the SP500 etf, and look at their historical performance - identical.Look at their holdings - almost exactly the same.The only major stocks they exclude are WMT, PM, BA, LMT, ADI - and all the others are a tiny % of the SP500.Imagine being able to drop a couple of major stocks from what is essentially the SP500 (well 300, they drop the smallest ones) and collecting 14bn - they get to charge a higher expense ratio too.14bn * 0.15% = 21 million per yearFairly profitable when IVV only charges 0.03% expense ratio, and at $330bn AUM, it collects 99 million per year.(Also 0.15% expense ratio might not seem much, but it's $1,500 on 1 mil per year. The way I see it while someone with 1mil in stocks can afford $1.5k per year, $1.5k still matters for someone with $1mil net worth, and it's 10% of the current 1.5% SP500 dividend yield)

But measuring things qualitatively is really difficult, especially since it opens you up to a lot of differing opinions and biases. So the funds try to somehow quantify those aspects, and they do it quite badly.

Compare this with Tesla, which fired its LGBT diversity officer last year and whose board is mostly made of white men.”
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 09:05:46'] Lithium mining isn’t exactly environmentally friendly either. Anti-union isn’t exactly worker friendly.Sure, tobacco is generally frowned upon because of the health impacts, but remember that those impacts are largely isolated to just people making that personal choice to smoke.Lots of reasons for Tesla to have poor ratings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 08:00:30'] My daughter bought a Tesla, so proud of her! As a conservative Christian I'm economically, politically and religiously opposed to ESG.I believe in Conservation, not filling landfills with toxic batteries and solar cells, we have to advance our recycling. Our grid can't support a nation of EV vehicles. Hybrid is a better option for domestic transportation at this stage of transition.I believe in equality, not equity that promises outcome without effort or ability. I believe God created men and women. I see trangenderism, spike proteins that target reproduction, the neutering of children, and abortion as the evil means to WEF goals of depopulation.Since buying Twitter and informing on the left establishment, election tampering, manipulation through shadow banning conservative voices,  Elon Musk has been on the left's hit list. And he used to be their darling. I also know China's TenCent is a major investor and influence in Reddit's culture. I anticipate downvoting from my "tolerant" leftist friends, and won't be surprised if my opinion never sees the light of day through moderated censorship.The bottom line is that a duty to investors never mixes well with politics. Just as you may find my views offensive, bigoted and narrow-minded, I find the alternatives equally repugnant.Justification? Ask A-B Inbev, Gillette, and Target about the cost of mixing woke culture and politics with business.

(TSLA was doing well on the 1-year chart compared to most of tech, until Elon said 'buy the dip' and dumped billions the next day, back around $300, and kept dumping billions more directly and through his foundation from Sept-Dec, leading to some shareholder bankruptcies and suicides).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 07:08:54'] I think it’s demonstrably ironic that there’s a comparison between his specific company & the *entire* tobacco industry that happens to be vilified for the mainly the cigarette portion of the industry. It would be more apt to compare all EV business to the entire tobacco industry or maybe to compare Tesla to some cigar manufacturer like AJ Fernandez or Davidoff. All I know is I want a cigar later today & it’s going to be more economically feasible than buying any Tesla vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 08:00:54'] That's heavily framing given that Philip Morris anounced to stop selling cigarrettes and started a campaign and program to help addicted to quit smoking. Ofcourse with this goals, Marlboro makes up for a better company then tesla, but this statement also absolutely ignores the fact that Philip Morris seem to accept their own fate as a dead industry as sealed.It's easy to say a tobacco company is more social, healthy and ecologically friendly if the company stops doing their core business and help people getting independent of the company - lol

There is a ton more that goes into this.Finally, cross sector comparisons don’t make sense for these metrics since a company who’s business is to produce carbon emissions (oil/gas) and a company producing medicine will have drastically different supply chains and tier 2/3 emissions and _shouldn’t_ be compared. (Basically, y’all aren’t reading it right anyway.)

Until he bought Twitter, we were all in on Tesla and was considering another one in the near future. I'm sure that this is not a unique position.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:06:10'] Ford moved up in reputation????  The auto industry, as a whole, is about to be a giant dumpster fire...The greedy dealerships (Ford being one of the worst offenders) were selling cars way over MSRP, and banks were offering loans way over a rational loan to value ratio.  If you paid over MSRP on a new car in the last 2 years, there's a really good chance you could buy a new model for less than what you owe right now....in some cases (like the bronco, mustang, f150 and lightning) where dealers were charging 25k-50k OVER msrp, you're probably toting a 60-70kk loan on a car that is worth 30-40k. Massive waves of repo's are coming even if there isn't a recession.  If we see a big wave of layoffs, its going to get bad...there is going to be a flood of used cars on the market at a discount.  Banks are going to liquidate for 50 cents on the dollar on a loan they're already upside down on.   Banks are already pulling out of the car business or tightening restrictions.  Every loan option that disappears takes out a level of potential new car buyers.

Early adopters have long since moved on from Tesla onto shinier, newer, cooler EVs. Car geeks never took much to Tesla, so the natural evangelizers (folk who tell their non-car geek friends what's what) haven't been a factor. It feels like a lot of people getting into the cars now are doing it for good lease rates, etc. So yea.... this report surprises me little.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 09:14:06'] Someone explain how does this reduces inflation Lol 😂, someones still paying for it. Also, why does it matter where it's produced if you're talking about price. Isn't that how world trade works? So then Tesla can't produce at different places even if they face parts shortage? Such nonsense laws
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 08:24:58'] Used 20k model 3 right around the corner now. I’ll gladly get one at that price

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 07:07:05'] How dumb can the govt get. Incentivize cars which do not use gas thus missing out on gas tax. So the economic impact is free money now with no return future for maintenance of roads and bridges. Net loss for the economy but I guess the rich getting richer and more people have access to these shitty plastic cars (that’s my description of a Tesla, a shitty plastic car).
