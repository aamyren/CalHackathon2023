	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 20:03:43'] Just for fun... it is perhaps somewhat interesting to note that this house still exists. (Something tells me a Gen1 Vision Pro won't be worth much in 67 years...)In any case, the house was built in 1956 so if we assume that's the ad year, $7450 then is worth between $83k and $220k in present money^[\(1\)](https://www.measuringworth.com/dollarvaluetoday/?amount=7450&from=1956) . As a curiosity, this house **was in fact** most recently sold for $83k.... albeit 35 years ago.Of course in 1956 the gold window was open and $7450 was equivalent to 212.85ozt of gold which today would be worth ~$417k which is much closer to the $517k-$556k estimated range from a few online sources, especially given that the home hasn't sold in 35 years, the online calculators are deeply flawed to the upside, and that they are trailing indicators besides.

No third party dev will want to develop apps for a small VR customer base which becomes a vicious cycle of nobody wants to buy it due to lack of games/apps then no developers wants to make app so on and so forth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 15:43:52'] Those were some pretty monstrous earnings. Apple's a long term hold. Not sure what people get out of trading it. It's basically a piggie bank that pays you dividends and gives you a rate of return on your money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 21:44:07'] Same reason i own SBUX. Ever seen the drive thru line at Starbucks at like 5 or 6 PM? Ya know, when Im generally thinking about dinner, they're are a LOT of people thinking of more caffeine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 18:56:16'] Walked into an Apple store in 2004. When I saw the line of people at the register, I bought my first round of AAPL. Have added to it ever since and never looked back. Apple üçè is my bank.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 19:58:15'] Their support center is in their store, they figured out a way to make their store look busy by having everyone come there to service their broken apple products.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 02:33:58'] Apple products are the Mercedes or BMWs of the computer world. Is Mercedes/BMW the fastest? (no that's Bugatti) Is it the most reliable? (no that's Toyota) Is it the most safest? (no that's Volvo). So why is Apple, BMW and Mercedes is such high demand year after year? It's status symbol. There's girls who won't date your ass because you use a ghetto Android.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 16:42:30'] Ultimate financialization. They are a bank , all the FAANG stocks are. They make money even when they sell little. Example; the new iPhone I typed this message on cost me $85 from Verizon. No matter how you cut it, it‚Äôs all financial shenanigans they are just the best at it. Did you know a few weeks back Apple was worth more than the entire British economy.  Anyone here believe that?

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 05:41:20'] Honestly I see a business opportunity here. Nobody likes waiting in these lines. Apple can be frustrating as hell and there are so many ways for people to lose data and not get great support (iTunes is a really old, clunky and unfriendly app). There‚Äôs a great opportunity here for someone to come in and do what Apple do but do it better. Nobody has succeeded yet but it doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt happen one day. All the giants eventually get disrupted.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 06:43:11'] The proprietary products is the reason it took so many years for appl to reach this magnitude but it worked and now they are the leaders I have been owning appl stocks as well as apple product for many years before they were popular everyone teased me why would you want apple always had superior visual graphics Now you can use apple with windows And visaversa Winner winner chicken dinner appleMy 3 offices has a HP and Mac on all three desk and I carry my apple note book I pad and phone in my back pack where ever I go
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 06:52:02'] It‚Äôs overvalued. So in everyone‚Äôs mind. Will always go up. Next step 4-5 trillion. They make a lot of money but they charge a lot without much change. From the iPhone X to the 13. I owed 3 models in between. They all feel the same. Better camera and faster. But not like a huge difference.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 06:52:42'] Apple has a clear sustainable competitive advantage: loyalty.  I could add time in there because people are reluctant to switch to another company because of the time it takes to learn a new product and switch everything over.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 07:13:49'] Just like Beanie Babies in the 90s.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 07:16:06'] Back in '18, I got my XR. First Apple product since iphone 4. Then I got an ipad pro 11.  It was really nice to use it along with my XR. Then I had to have something while on the go. I got an ipad mini 5 which I'm still enjoying. Then I needed a speaker. I got a homepod mini.... and so on.  Now, I'm stuck in the ecosystem.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 08:00:53'] I had one of the worst customer service experiences there in my life recently.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 08:30:54'] Apple was the 2nd stock I ever bought, for $7 a share when they were revolutionizing the computer bidness.  Today I hold 850 shares, bought in the $120's.  I have owned it 7 times and made $$ every time.  I own no Apple products, I can't afford them, but I am glad others wait in line to buy them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 08:36:01'] This has to be the Dallas Galleria
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 08:41:22'] I hate apple, but they have a business model that locks people to their brand. It really sucks, it's a fuck you in the ass business model. I don't know why people like that, and buy from companies like that, mostly likely due to wanting to be viewed as being cooler than the counterparts, but man fuck apple.ALso, Tesla has the same business model. THat's why I won't buy from either company. I also won't invest in that kind of a company. It's set to fail big time one day, for now it's fine, but their business model of fucking the customer over isn't going to do well for much longer.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 12:08:17'] Can you share where and when this was taken?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 15:49:21'] I finally jumped in when it dipped.  Not on purpose, just happened to be when I had the funds to do so.  GREAT company and growing.  Are you confident in their cloud computing and abilities growing larger and larger?
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 19:34:15'] People need to understand the the COMPANY is not the STOCK and vice versa. Not saying anything is wrong with Apple but it is something to keep in mind.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-30 10:55:43'] Not to say Apple isn‚Äôt busy, but I‚Äôd just note a couple of things:1. At least in Canada, stores have put capacity limits, so the store likely isn‚Äôt packed like sardines like precovid. There might be 5-10 customers actually in the store assuming the capacity limits would apply to USA as well.2. The line likely includes people who are getting a repair done or just asking a technician a question about some issue with their product. You can even see one girl that is holding her MacBook in her hand

I am a stock investor and I would prefer for the market to rise but that is not what I expect.Higher interest rates will persist, high inflation will hurt the consumer, a war in Ukraine and an overheated real estate market that is about to correct.  From 2009, we have been in an up market cycle.  So it might be time for the market to let a lot of air out of the bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:31:23'] You‚Äôll get a rotation into value: crude won‚Äôt stay below 70 forever either. Keep in mind if the fed pauses or inflation continues to fall the dollar is going to fall in value. Stocks are priced in dollars obviously but that‚Äôs going to be a backdrop for a continued rally. But this time investors have options: you can get a 3-4% CD at a bank this time or even bonds with decent yields. There‚Äôs trillions sitting on the sidelines in money markets looking for appreciation better than single digit returns they are getting.If you‚Äôre a fund manager you won‚Äôt get fired for a bear market, but you will get fired for missing a bull market

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:05:36'] 14 years of QE after GFC allowed zombie companies to exist via easy access to capital. with rising interest rates, the existence of these companies are under threat, while cash rich companies like the tech giants are well insulated and are hence seen as "safe". this along with the AI theme helps explain why big tech is leading so much.That being said, we saw the market get hammered by tons of bad news a couple of months ago. everyone was on the bear wagon. those short positions are being obliterated right now, which helps explain this recent melt up in the market, and a drastic shift in sentiment.But fundamentally, has anything changed? not at all. people constantly make the fallacy of correlating the market with the economy. \*spoiler, they. are. not. the. same.\* druckenmiller figured out the housing bubble in 2004. market hit peak short interest in mid 2007. those shorts got squeezed out after the market continued to rally. sentiment shifted as the market topped, and the shit hit the fan in late 2008. is the recession coming? as sure as there'll be another rainy day. when will it be is anyone's guess. and if anything, if Ray Dalio is right,  people are likely underestimating the severity of the next big one.I'm a nobody and I know next to nothing, but those are my thoughts

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:32:47'] Why does it start in dec 2022 making it an 18 month graph?There is a classic how to lie with statistics fallacy that may be at play here.  If you can select arbitrary start points you can select the slope of perceived gains. It occurred to me because meta is in there and i bought the dip on meta.Meta had this huge covid income surge that swelled it's price followed by a "let's spend billions on vr that nobody wants" (dip) followed by a "thats dumb let's not do that" which resulted in gains. The percentage gain to now can be manipulated a lot by just moving a month or two.  When your list is down to 5 stocks, and one of them is already noted to have that issue, how you selected your start point matters allot to interpretation.Was it selected to maximize the percieved gains of those 5 stocks? If so that is a bias not predictive of future performance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 07:31:31'] Interesting graph and I think it is even more impressive to consider the more than 100% YTD performance of NVDA, META, and TSLA ‚Äî the first one due to generative AI tailwinds and the other two as bounce backs. If equally weighted the big tech performance will be even greater than the performance of the S&P 500. I think investors see big tech as all-weather stocks with enough cash for a recession and as the leading drivers of growth in our country. Some of the valuations are quite high like NVDA and AMZN, which could very well mean that the rest of the market is significant undervalued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 15:50:25'] Equal weight sp500 ETF up 4.5% year-to-date, and coming out of a several month base, suggestive of some incoming sector rotation imo. 56% of s&p 500 companies are currently trading above their 200-day moving average. Nothing abnormal there to me.I think big tech has just been the easy play as markets position for a soft landing, and position themselves for AI. Consolidation becoming more likely.I personally think big tech is the trade of the next decade, so I expect to see a lot of charts like this.At the very least, I don't really see how you get from "some companies are doing great while others are doing a little bit worse than average" to "imminent crash".Also s&p 500 is up closer to 15% year-to-date not 11%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 02:07:10'] The thing I don‚Äôt like about this is that while most of the big companies have run up it doesn‚Äôt really show an accurate picture. This is implying that ALL 493 stocks have done nothing other than the big 7. But look under the hood more, Eli Lilly has run a bunch which means some companies have gone down a bunch. There are several of the 493 that are up 20%, there are plenty of companies that are down 20%+. So it‚Äôs just not a great way to look at it in my view. If the chart showed all financial sector together I bet that would show regional banks -50% or however much it would be for their collective shit performance

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 20:39:19'] My take on this is I have the biggest fucking grin on my face after going balls deep in tech at the start of the year. Going forward tech will be the main driver of GDP gains through increased operational efficiency, and I think we're seeing people allocate investments accordingly. Prices are likely to get ahead of themselves in the short term, but I still think tech is king long term.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 23:47:41'] As an AI language model, I cannot directly view or analyze specific graphs or real-time data. However, predicting whether a recession is imminent or not based solely on a single S&P 500 graph is challenging. The S&P 500 index is influenced by various economic factors, [market conditions, and investor sentiment](https://efimarkets.com/), making it difficult to make definitive predictions.    It's important to note that predicting economic cycles and market downturns is a complex task even for experts. Recessionary periods are influenced by a combination of factors such as GDP growth, employment rates, interest rates, geopolitical events, and consumer sentiment, among others.    To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the economic outlook, it is advisable to analyze a wide range of indicators, conduct thorough research, and consider expert opinions. This can help provide a more informed perspective on the likelihood of a recession or potential market trends.

While I personally prefer Android phones, I am long on AAPL due to their ability to sell auxiliary products/services to its customers. Look at Apple Watch or Air pods sales. They are just printing money selling these and that is not going to stop. We will soon see Apple AR/VR glasses/goggles and many other products. They also seem to justify the huge premium over other brands. Look at US. They seem to have > 50% of premium smartphone market. I am not seeing that changing in the near future.

I owned android and iPhone. Android all my life up until 6years ago & I talked negative about apple and the simplicity. When in reality iPhones have better software, doest freeze,crash, or overheat  (as long as keep w/ updates)  just as good speakers if not better than most devices. Also apple owns Beats üéß by Dre.

Maybe then we will see a spike possibly followed by a continued slow drop until OCT~NOV time frame.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 01:14:46'] Ben Graham's formula gives AAPL a fair value of  $175.79. FINBOX says the fair value is $150.47. I saw a DCF model that said $107.46 and another $148.47. If you average them all, you get a fair value of $145.55. AAPL currently trades at $155.65. These data suggest that AAPL is slightly overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 06:22:07'] Of course it‚Äôs overpriced
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 07:05:53'] Price = Short-termValue = Long-termApple is not really overpriced, but it is on the very high end of fair valuation right now. Just look at P/E  or P/S. Or even forward P/E. For P/E, Apple is trading at the very high end of where it was trading pre-covid. P/S is a bit higher than pre-covid but that's fair due to higher margins as they've shifted to services.An asset can be priced however a buyer/seller want to price it. But over the long-term, price eventually intersects with value. The question is, can the high prices hold out long enough for the underlying valuation and earnings to catch-up? With the fed increasing rates, my guess is no. Interest rates are increasing too quickly.Pre covid, Apple was trading at a max P/S of 5.5x, and a max P/E of 25x. They are right around 25x P/E right now, so they're within range of fair value. Rates are increasing though and in the last QT period leading up to 2018/2019 pivot, apple was closer to 20x. So it stands to reason that sometime during this QT period, Apple's P/E will drop to 20x. Based on trailing earnings, this would be a price per share of $120 which is a 21% decline from current prices.There's no telling how quickly this correction to the multiple will occur though. If earnings can catch up before multiple reality sets in, the price will not actually drop.Forward estimate earnings for APPL is about $6.45/share. Using the 20x multiple and that earnings estimate gets you to $129/share. This is still a 16% drop from current levels. So my guess is that Apple's price is coming down to at least $129 within the next 6-12 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:57:15'] Do your own research. This is Not financial advice. As someone who works in finance, I learned it's great to get your first $100K-200K in some broad blended stock index fund before being cute and silly with individual stock picks. VOO tracks the S&P 500 so it's great core holding that fits the above mold. Your other stocks are the top holdings within the S&P 500 so all you're doing is concentrating or tilting more towards the current best companies that everyone agrees are the best in this current day and age. Sentiment, fundamentals, and management teams change shifts over time for companies so it's not guaranteed the top companies will stay the top companies.For that reason, investing in something that changes with the times makes rational sense. Index funds periodically rebalance to add winners and losers without you needing to analyze individual companies. That said, my single stock pick gamble at the moment is 140 shares of GOOGL and that comprises 5% of my total portfolio. I like to gamble with maximum of 5% at any given time. The rest of my stock exposure comes primarily from S&P 500 (FXAIX), Nasdaq-100 (QQQ), total international stock index (VXUS).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:57:40'] Diversify from big tech.Take about 10% of your holdings and put it into something smaller cap and riskier. The companies you‚Äôre invested in are all mega cap, the biggest of market caps. They are all over a trillion in market cap so you will not see huge gains over a long period of time. Going from 10 billion market cap to one trillion is 10,000% return. Going from 1 trillion to 2 trillion is a 100% return. The higher a companies market cap the less amount of total return you can expect to see going into the future. So your investments are very safe but you are already invested in well established companies that already had their big runs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 18:31:12'] Sell it all. Buy otm call options on mstr that expire 2yrs from now.  Do that after a steep downturn in mstr (probably tomorrow) Sell fewer otm covered calls to offset theta decay AFTER letting mstr swing back up and your portfolio shows gains (10%ish gain). Mstr basically equals btc. Try to get as many year+ otm naked long calls as possible within next 6 months. Mstr probably will be breaking 300 again within next few weeks, if not months. Revisiting ATH is what we're after with next 2 years, that's over 300% roi on the stock alone. Sure you could buy the stock,  but why not go big? I pulled out a loan to do this 6 months ago. Already paid back the loan and I'm up 300% already.Play the theta decay game and you'll go positive during stagnant times. Portfolio will look like a Rollercoaster without having covered calls, BUT each covered call limits your upside potential while softening drops.(After selling covered calls, keep cash as dry powder to buy more otm call options after price drops)

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-30 07:54:55'] Keep in mind this is YOY revenue growth.   This is the calculation: (q3 revenue 2022 - q3 revenue 2021)/q3 revenue 2021  As we can see, we had some amazing growth in 2021 just given all that free government money and disposable income. Now growth is slowing down significantly. Market historically likes aapl around 15-20 PE. Does it make sense right now to be buying appl when it's sitting around 27 PE?   Also Tim cook said accelerated revenue growth for the fall. He did not tell us how much.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-30 09:25:39'] Of course not. It made sense to buy when they are down below that 15-20 in 2011-12.Unfortunately you don‚Äôt usually get down to lower ratios without negative sentiment. So you have to choose - do you think picking up a well performing company at a good value is smart, or do you think you are smart enough to pick the point that that company will now enter decline? Because thats typically the two questions you face when looking at a deal. Today that deal is called Meta.

But over 6X the growth rate that Apple delivered.Think the lesson here is give guidance but sandbag like crazy.BTW, full disclosure that I am a long term Apple share holder.  Owned before it was even considered cool.  Well I am old.  I should say the before the second time it was cool to own.   I also think that Apple is got really, really expensive and be careful.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 08:46:07'] Services revenue I think could be this company's savior. People aren't leaving the apple ecosystem, they have just saturated the market and there is no longer big improvements that warrant refreshing as often. So you keep the same IPhone longer but maybe you'll be paying for Icloud to store more data since Apple has been historically stingy about internal storage space and apps/pics/videos size will naturally grow over time.

POST_TEXT: b'Apple shares are at great risk of a major pullback in case the economic slowdown proves to be greater-than-expected, Goldman Sachs analysts told clients.\n\nAnalyst Rod Hall sees a downside risk of 42% for Apple shares if the bear-case scenario is materialized.\n\nHis new base-case scenario has Apple shares trading at $130.00 per share, which is a new price target (down from the prior $157.00). The lowered price target reflects decreased revenue forecasts by \\~2% in both FY23 and FY24.\n\nIn our Base case forecast for Apple, we model a revenue CAGR of 10% from CY19A - CY23E which we note is an acceleration from the 3% growth the company delivered between CY15A - CY19A. We model the companys EBIT margin and EPS to expand to 28.1% and $5.81 respectively in CY23 from 24.7% and $3.17 in CY19 Our Bear case revenue and EPS estimates imply the potential for 22% and 33% downside risk vs. consensus, respectively, Hall wrote.\n\nRead the full article: [https://ph.investing.com/news/stock-mark'

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 16:15:48'] You're missing very important variables in your analysis - too many to mention in a short response. The EPS and FCF will grow much faster than the revenue will due to services segment alone (antitrust pending.)Instead, let's say AAPL was $78 per share, like you think it should be. That would put AAPL's market cap at, what, 1.2 Trillion? They spend nearly $100 billion per year on buybacks, and growing. They'd buy back the entire company if it ever got that low again. AAPL is my one holding that I actually get excited for dips, because it means Luca can buy back more. The only way AAPL will ever get that low is if 1) China geopolitical issues/war 2) Antitrust wipes their service revenue off the face of the earth.

No matter how smart your car gets, you use it to go from A to B while you use your phone for every single thing. The only companies that can overtake Apple in market cap in the near future are Google and Microsoft.

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:20:50'] Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Since your portfolio is relatively small, you won‚Äôt create much of a tax event by selling everything but VTI (or VOO). If you want to do the dividend thing, then sprinkle some SCHD in there. You won‚Äôt be far from the total US market. It‚Äôs hard to do much better than that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:52:04'] VOO is SPY. In Each it counts Google two times because of Googl & Goog plus Brk\_B counts two more times.  You also have Google.VTI has 85 pct in SPY slightly more diversified. So you got same stock 4 times. Amz, Adobe, AAPL, MSFT similar content is included.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 18:38:41'] The rest stocks are OK. Make sure the DIS is doing well. Lots of politics.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 13:51:30'] You have a very high amount of overlap between VOO, SPY, and VTI -- four of the top five holdings for these ETFs are AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL, which you also have.The main question you will need to answer is whether you should sell everything else or try to create a more differentiated portfolio by putting more money into V, DIS, ADBE, and/or SCHD.If you would prefer to avoid the headache, leaving your portfolio as is would also be a perfectly reasonable approach.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:53:37'] I suggest VOO and SPY get merged as 1.  Rest are tech heavy except DIS and V.  Suggest add consumer staple for diversification.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 19:14:17'] I'm more into ETFsI tend to overcomplicate my portfolio but I know when I overlap, it is by choice. Just hope you know your overlaps. If you do, it's fine, it just means you wanted more weight in this or that title. In the end, the biggest allocation should still be the S&P500. I personally believe in more diversification than this on the long term, like international (also emerging markets to a lesser extent). I don't have any ticker to recommend since I buy pretty much everything in CAN$, but an ETF holding the whole world excluding the US would be a good diversification. It also tends to give more dividends than the US market. People tend to say to just invest in the US because of the higher return, but there's a lot of studies on bogleheads showing that adding some international helps the risk reward curve and can even provide a higher total return during flat periods. Between 5 and 20%.Emerging around 5%, no more than 10%.Your tech heavy, and concentrated in Google, Apple, etc... I prefer to buy the Nasdaq100.I also like to increase my exposure to real estate. Avoid ETFs with commercial right now. I don't mind paying fees for active management in real estate.They say to always have some gold, either billions or an ETF if gold producers.

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 05:30:27'] The S&P500 is cap weighted. By definition this should always be the case as long as the top 20 in this particular study perform well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 08:32:25'] Lol have you heard of cap weighted indices???
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 08:32:23'] This has always been the case. Cap weighting aside, it‚Äôs hard to pick the winners. And the broad market gains historically have always been focused on a small number of stocks and a small number of days, too. And not just the big caps. Hence DCA the whole market and don‚Äôt forget small caps.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 09:27:30'] This isn't unusual.  Over longer periods of time, returns of cap weighted indexes are often dominated by a few equities while many are flat or negative.  It used to be said that 30-40 equities were enough to replicate but I'm not sure any more. This is a reason why beating broad market baskets over long periods is difficult---if you miss the rare extraordinary company, you miss a reasonable fraction of total return.  That's easy to do in an active management portfolio because there isn't enough effort possible to deeply study too many equities.It also means a small number of portfolios will occasionally have amazing returns if they did include the positive outliers.This is consistent with the notion that post industrial revolution, economic gains are made by technological shifts whose benefits are often concentrated in a few companies.  In earlier times, economic gains were a product of broad deployment of capital using well known and non-proprietary technologies, so returns might not have been so dispersed.  Those easy gains, e.g. from electrification of formerly manual industries, have been achieved already.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 08:58:21'] So why didn‚Äôt you name the 20?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 06:35:51'] This is drawing the wrong conclusion.Because the market is cap-weighted, it will almost always be true that the biggest groupings of stocks have the biggest overall gains in a rising market, but there are also variations within these groups.To throw out numbers and a few examples, the S&P500 is up 7.85% this year.XOM is the 9th largest company in the index by market cap, and is up 9.03% this year.  PG is the 15th largest company and is *down* 1.36% this year.Meanwhile AO Smith is way down the list, being the 466th largest company in the index and is up 16.85% this year. It's near the bottom of the "remaining 480 stocks" but is beating two in the "top 20", as well as more than doubling the index overall.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 05:29:56'] Any fool investing in MCD's now deserves what is coming.    I stopped at two of them three Sundays ago to try to order three egg biscuits for breakfast.    Sat in the first one's drive through line for seven minutes, then at the speaker for five - nobody was taking orders. I drove around and waited at for the car ahead of me to get its change (that took a LONG time). Most people kept leaving the line to give up on it, but I got to the window and ordered. Except that I didn't ... "we don't have egg biscuits" is what I was told. What he meant was that there wasn't a button for that, or that he couldn't find one - so he was just going to charge me for bacon egg and cheese biscuits and then throw away the bacon and cheese, but of course charge me $13.XX for the privilege. He even checked with the manager, and that was the best they could come up with for one of the most common items they sell.    So I left, and made it to another McD's before breakfast ended. This time I walked in. I was NOT ready for what I walked in to, though. Eight of the most unhappy people - who had already ordered - were waiting for their food. Then I looked around me; the tables that had people in them ALSO had no food.    The service and quality of McD's has dropped off like a rock into a lake. I wasted 45 minutes across two McD's and ended up with no food to show for it.    McD's has to be losing clients left and right. Nobody in their right mind would wait 20 minutes for McD's food AFTER having had to wait 10 minutes, or more, to order it.    McD's old promise of "If you don't get your order in five minutes or less, your order is free" promise is gone.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 19:32:55'] You can discover nothing about the future of the stock market or any individual stocks by looking at this diagram. If you look at the inverse yield curve ( long term bonds have a lower yield than short term bonds) you may lessen your exposure to stocks in the next year. If the PE ratio of the entire market is lower now that it has been in the last 30 years you may want to increase your stock holdings.However, I doubt that that making such adjustments to your portfolio will really help you. It is almost impossible to correctly time the market. I know that these statements will not hold you back. They do not even hold me back.

Even with VIX down the moves are still big, it's a hidden volatility or for whatever reason the VIX isn't reflecting it.Dollar wrecking ball is definitely incoming. DXY looks like a megabull, cup and handle pattern is almost completed. This pattern was common in the 80s when post-inflationary recessions hit. Looks exactly the same.

Throw it all into TSLA before investor day...EDIT: "Regarded" is a fill-in for a word that sounds like it, but is derogatory and implies a mental disorder of some sort. The use of "regarded" is so simply circumvent a reddit suspension or ban. By no means do I believe it is improper to use the derogatory word. I personally use the word without hesitation, just not on reddit.

It‚Äôs true that if you wanna work down  on your average, best way to do it, is put the same amount of money as the original investment? Let‚Äôs say I have 5000k worth in AAPL or Bitcoin with a 30% deficit!! Do I have to put another 5000k to break even???? Thanks
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 08:39:53'] Does anyone know why their earnings keep going up?  Their earnings are basically double what they used to make a couple years ago and from what I can tell they haven't put out a new product... without actually looking at their sales numbers I'd assume people are buying the same amount to fewer as the phones are lasting longer.  Maybe with the stimulus money they had some extra sales but not 2x and not a permament shift.  Just looking for some insight if anyone knows the fundamentals of this company?Follow up question why would the P/E of this company be so much higher than it was say 5 years ago?  You would think they are actually decelerating out of growth mode.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 14:10:49'] APPL is my long term buy.  Whether the economy is good or bad, people aren't going 5 minutes without a phone.   My shares will sit there going up, until my son makes me mad and I sell it all and spend it in Vegas.

You never take profit and just hold them for 10 years, no matter what? I bought like 10 stocks in 2022 that went up between 20 and 30%... but never took profit. Some of them went back down and are at the beginning, so 0% profit in those stocks now. How do you deal with that? Do you set an alarm when the stock goes up 30% you sell, or how do you do it?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 11:43:31'] The most important thing is that which stock went up the most in dollar amount

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:11:42'] The stock market is a marketplace where publicly traded companies' stocks are bought and sold. When a company wants to raise money, it can do so by issuing stocks, which are shares of ownership in the company. Investors can then buy these stocks, becoming part owners of the company. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand in the market, with the price rising as more people want to buy the stock and falling as more people want to sell. The stock market can be a good way for companies to raise money and for investors to make money, but it also involves risk as the value of stocks can fluctuate widely.

The stock goes down $5 as you thought and then stays there and your put expires worthless because everyone thought the same thing which is why the puts were worth $5 in the f\\*\\*king first place.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 14:45:31'] Actually im considering going hard in on GOOGL and AMZN. GOOGL: people saying Bing will take over, its a joke. ChatGPT is great and i have used it a lot, but i have not used google less. Completly different use cases. Google has had insane growth rates over the years, and even if its going to slow down a bit its not going to stop anytime soon because of chatGPT. If anything, ChatGPT will just boost MSFT when they integrate it to office and azure. AMZN: behemoth currently valued below 1T, which in reality should be the valuation of AWS alone. They are catching up and surpassing competitors in so many categories: distribution, advertising, entertainment etc. Im really hoping for a bigger market crash so i can go in hard, but just in case it doesn‚Äôt come i have started averaging in both these companies
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:48:14'] Both I think are great buys, but of the two--  which one do you you use more and there isn't a challenger in sight?  I think Amazon.  But with GAMMA I think you can't go wrong over the next 5 to 10 years.  Google, Apple, Master Card, MSFT, and Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 21:26:32'] Amazon is a great stock to buy and hold for the very long term, even as its short-term prospects feel slightly murky. However, Alphabet is undeniably the better buy today. The digital advertising market may have suffered from poor macroeconomic conditions in 2022, but it's unlikely to be down for long.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 02:50:03'] It's difficult to see how these stocks don't recover long term, I recenlty bought some more but will probably hold off from buying again unless there is bit more of a dip, I don't want to over expose myself too much in 1 stock.But if I hadn't recently bought I would definitely be buying more now at this price.

They LOST money on data center this past year and still struggle to compete with AMD.GOOG has a ‚Äò23 FCF yield of ~6.5% at $95/share - math tells me that‚Äôs a good long term hold level.

Also they over pay their software engineers by a lot and then have them goof off all day at their offices. Amazon I agree on though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 17:33:17'] No, they are not good buys. Roughly the top 10 companies change every decade or so. They will remain as companies and slowly grow into blue chip and dividend stocks, but it is unlikely they will ever be growth stocks again.

It‚Äôs not looking good. Rates up or down it‚Äôs become a clear impasse that can only end up with a default or hyperinflation.At the current rate level it‚Äôs costing 25bn a week of loss for the treasury ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs massive in case you‚Äôre asking.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 23:08:29'] Yes they are
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 23:35:54'] Get some shares in ETFs like VTI, VOO, ect. You seem really tech heavy and if one of the FANG tech stocks go down sometimes the other tech follows. If you can stomach that then that is not my place to judge, but I would diversify more into other sectors just in case of a dip. Again it all depends on your own comfort. I am also a little tech heavy, but I‚Äôm young and now re-diversifying into more stable etfs over individual stocks.Maybe take a look into QQQ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 00:34:09'] The AI wars will probably shaken the relationship and position in the tech industry quite a bit. Google has the most to loose since it's already the dominant search engine and has the majority of income coming in through ads, a business model which new Ai search engines or chatbots might threaten quite a bit.Microsoft has the most to gain since it has a very diversified income stream and has aligned itself perfectly with OpenGPT, which it will further incorporate into Bing and its other office products. Amazon has large cloud service in its AWS segment, which other companies who develop AI tech will need. So even if retails keeps falling, AWS will continue to hold them up. So I'd put AMZN above Googl. Saying that, nobody really knows and it's all a guess.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:51:54'] Long-term definitely. DCA is good to go, however i do think there is still a room for few% drop in tech sectors for now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:56:02'] No worries about a further drop cos of bing and chatgpt?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 04:57:58'] More to bleed so probably good to be conservative for 6 months maybe. I can see Google going to high 70s as it peaks and valleys down over the next quarter or two. However I do believe it‚Äôs a good long term hold as behaviorally it‚Äôs too Entrenched with internet behavior and synonymous with search for most. Will it have explosive growth‚Ä¶ maybe maybe not but maybe it‚Äôs just in a new phase and has evolved into the MSFT DELL INTC level of stability I am Less certain on Amazon. They are about to run out of available workers for their warehouses which will snarl Operations. As inflation continued and unemployment gets larger people will be more cautious with their spend and so the purchasing throughput will also slow down. But in general you are way to overindexed on tech and should consider diversifying even if it‚Äôs just at a minimum putting 30% of the port into VTI or VOO.

Within that $40 million stock awards, $30 million will be dependent on AAPL share performance. If AAPL share hits performance thresholds, the $30 million will be doubled to at least $60 million.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 08:48:49'] AH bid/ask spreads get increasingly wider as their is significant less volume and liquidity in AH market. Therefore you might see a bid on a certain exchange for far less than what it‚Äôs ticker is currently at especially in OTC markets.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 11:38:48'] Someone is putting in a Market order to sell after hours. These orders call for the broker to find a buy order ASAP. But volatility (swing in price) is much higher after hours due to supply and demand. If someone wanted to sell 5,000 shares of the underlying at current market value but only 1,000 shares were available the order would partially fill. The stock price would drop due to the large sell off but would recover once they find the buyers for the stock. It could just be a group of individuals/funds not wanting to hold the stock overnight for fear of potential losses. Or potentially whales triggering stop loss orders to buy up shares after hours. Could be a dozen reasons why they are doing it but the explanation stays the same for the spike in the graph.

SPY was in a classic megaphone pattern. You have a tendency to over-parallel your lines. Parallels are the best structures to trade but only if they are accurate.It ended up not making a huge difference in SPY this round. But in the 1970s it mattered a lot. 1970s was all about the megaphone, for a decade.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 16:15:36'] 3 things... 1) you don't have to do everything at once like people have mentioned... DCA is a fair way to invest long term. but remember to take profits... today was the 2nd time I had to stop loss in the last 3 years because I wasn't paying enough attention and found out late they were liquidating or filing chapter 11, which leads to 2) don't get into more positions than you are ok to track, and keep up with the news otherwise you are holding for the sake of holding. if you're doing that just get the indexes... literally I do that on a monthly basis to avoid the extra research 3) look at the 5yr and 10yr...we are at levels now that we're seen back then in many places, so we are hitting a cycle, but the fed and govt are doing some shady stuff too so who knows what will happen.nutshell a) don't invest what you cannot afford to lose B) make sure you are ok with the choices to act, don't act, or do something else.

If anything, your money in the market will help support the market, of which he owns a big chunk.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 11:18:16'] Apple is one of the best run companies out there but its seen its valuation increase significantly primarily through multiple expansion, not earnings growth. Now it‚Äôs trading at a fairly high PE. I think it‚Äôs not unreasonable for people to be taking profits and looking for better opportunities.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 11:03:58'] I think they are just cashing in the profit they made until now on AAPL to reinvest somewhere  to earn even more. Also, some probably noted that Buffett is leaving so they decided to do it too just because he's Warren Buffet.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 13:00:00'] "If AAPL is really a buy"Wait, wait, slow down, why would that be the default opinion to be questioned?Everything I've been reading has been saying there is a bubble in tech growth stocks. Is that supposed to mean "buy?"
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 11:04:41'] Depends who you ask. Apes will tell you they're covering for the short lmao
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 11:17:36'] Just a guess here...but it is a rebalance after a strong run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-24 06:03:25'] Funds will often do what is referred to as "Portfolio Management".Imagine a fund has 10 stocks in it, each allocated as 10% of the entire portfolio (AAPL being one).After some time, what happens if AAPL stock price increases by 10% and all the other stocks decrease by 10%?The net effect is that AAPL would now constitute a much higher percentage of your portfolio than you are comfortable with, thus you sell the "excess" AAPL.If you truly did not think AAPL was a buy at all, you would likely sell your entire position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 11:15:52'] 10yr yield is increasing allowing for investment in treasuries again, simply seems like a slight risk off play to me, trimming some profits from securities and most likely adding to bond positions now that they‚Äôre giving a more adequate return.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 06:46:09'] Nah...  I think we will be range bound/sideways from here for a while.  I doubt we make new lows unless unemployment starts rising.  We won't make new highs until the macroeconomic situations improve (inflation subsiding, FED cutting, economy growing at a higher rate).  This will probably a long way off though. The recent market catalysts have not been as bad a feared. Markets priced in worse.  Many of the speculative bubble stocks and tech have basically crashed.  You look at some of these charts and all the 2020-2022 gains are gone. Now there are fair buying opportunities in a lot of these beaten down names and money has been rotating into them.

POST_TEXT: b'&#x200B;\n\nApple has just hit an incredible milestone. You may have guessed it. Yes, it became the first [tech stock](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing/tech-stocks) to pass the $2 trillion mark. This comes ahead of a 4-for-1 stock split that will lower the entry barrier for prospective investors to buy shares. The iPhone maker has beaten the other tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft to reach this milestone. Of course, this is a largely symbolic figure. Theres nothing significant changing fundamentally. But the bottom line is that Apple is doing very, very well. Maybe you are like many other investors who are contemplating whether to [buy AAPL stock now](https://stockmarket.com/featured/apple-heres-how-it-could-impact-your-investments-2020-08-13).

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 13:40:46'] I honestly think AAPL still has room to grow. Outside of the psychology of purchasing a split stock before and after, the technology sector is an ever evolving one and along with biotech has a large room for future growth. AAPL cut Intel from making their chips which means they are developing chips made specifically for AAPL products which means save in costs from R&D as well as avoiding outside hurdles. AAPL is its own ecosystem already and to further make themselves self sufficient is good in my eyes. Tech bubble may pop, but I feel it‚Äôs also detrimental to sit on the sidelines. You don‚Äôt lose money until you sell and APPL is a blue chip company that I can only see recovering and pushing for better products.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 21:17:26'] I bought Apple a few days go (I had it before and then assigned it at 420 a few weeks ago) because they have a stock split coming up.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-20 12:43:04'] At $2 trillion, cash flow yield on Apple is about 3%. That's the return you'd get if you bought the whole company. If you wanted say a 10% return on your money Apple is worth about a third of its current price. So the question you have to ask yourself is are you OK with a 3% return or do you want something more?

Shareholder equity is a plug to make sure A=L+SE. So if the rise in liabilities outpaces assets, shareholder equity goes down. This is typical for companies that take big bets or early stage companies. but Shareholder equity does not equal value to the shareholders.

Sometimes I get the stock and I never see it at the price on the daily chart, so I assume I got lucky AH.

	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 09:24:01'] It‚Äôs not about the speaker. Why don‚Äôt people get this. It‚Äôs about the AI. Apple has garbage AI in Siri. Anyone can make a good speaker, they are all over the place. Amazon and Google are now light years ahead in terms of the AI until Apple decides to try to really make something happen with Siri
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 06:12:53'] It‚Äôs not actually the same market, and I think that was a very deliberate choice from Apple going in.  The HomePod is focusing on the high end, and of course a $350 HomePod is not going to compete against a $50 Echo Dot.  A better comparison is against higher-end systems from Sonos & Bose.

	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 09:10:26'] If only they would make the HomePod the wireless charging epicenter for your phone, watch, iPad, and other Apple products, then Apple would have a game changer and competitive edge over Amazon.The rumor circulating was that HomePod was where AirPower was intended to debut.  A company called Energous (WATT) was rumored to be pioneering the technology. Check it out. If this is an announcement next month, I‚Äôll buy one.
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 10:40:45'] In addition to things others have already suggested, there is probably also a bit of a disconnect between this type of device and Apple's pursuit of (at least minimally) privacy-conscious consumers. *Everyone* has been railing on the Echo and things like the Xbox One's Kinect feature for years.
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-19 11:43:48'] I just went through the process of getting a smart speaker and between all of the options I went with a 3rd party (Sonos One) so I could utilize all of the big 3's systems (Amazon, Google, and Apple). My takeaway was that Apple is missing the boat. Apple's speaker is focused on their music service and not integrating more tightly with the rest of their ecosystem. I actually might have considered Apple's speaker if it allowed voice control and integration with Apple TV, but even something as basic as that was missing.  No regrets going with Sonos for the multi-platform support.

Inexperienced retail traders bite the hand that feeds. Bear in mind that we can all thank these absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing from the Fed as a reason crypto and the stock market exploded after March of 2020 in the first place. The stock market literally doubled in less than 2 years. It would be a complete policy error mistake to not scale that delusional overvalued BS down a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 11:51:09'] You can thank the republicans for giving a massive tax break that went into effect right before a global pandemic.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 09:04:07'] The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn‚Äôt fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don‚Äôt realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.       This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out.

	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 04:26:44'] Potentials for loosing (Edit: losing) their edge over the coming years:- They don't seem to be on top of the voice assistant game to the same extent as google is, or alexa, and theres google home too which is superior to apples equivalent. This home assistant box is still kind of taking off so it may become a massively missed market for them if the others keep outpacing them. Google home becoming popular could get more switches to android for better integration, becoming a bigger pull away from the apple ecosystem.- Competitors phones are getting as sleek as the iPhone, and some are managing under screen fingerprint recognition etc. that apple hasn't managed yet. They are catching up to apples design edge. They aren't quite there yet but the gap is closing.- If apple keep up the higher phone price but still make new phones at the same regularity will people keep upgrading as frequently? I've heard lots of 'the X is a big upgrade, but I cant do this every two years'. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 05:20:19'] No. US Treasuries are the safest investment out there. Granted, the return is nothing special. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 07:54:23'] IMO AAPL is a relatively safe bet but I think they are a poor choice for growth; they have  effectively attained market saturation, so their future stock performance will depend on how well they maintain that, and how well they innovate into new markets. I don‚Äôt think they are doing that great of a job on the latter, and there is a lot of competition and threats out there to consider. If you want a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù bet, I‚Äôd avoid tech altogether and go with something ‚Äúboring‚Äù like JNJ or XOM.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 04:46:03'] There is nothing "safe" about buying an individual stock and even good companies like Apple will have huge price swings.  I think you mean "is Apple the safest individual stock out there".   To answer your question though I don't think you could label Apple as "safe" given the traditional definition for a safe stock investment:  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginofsafety.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginofsafety.asp)

We were debating if Berkshire was the safest stock investment and got into a discussion if it would be better to just purchase brk.b or all of its holdings individually.  We started going through the individual holdings and settled on Apple as the right balance of safety with likelihood of growth. So I wouldn't say it's safe but the risk reward seems good right now for the reasons you mention.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 09:07:16'] This friday
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 10:00:25'] Other commenters keep talking about AAPL‚Äôs core product, iPhone, like it needs to be feature filled and innovative. The truth is, iPhone has never really been the most innovative or feature packed phone. People have their own reasons for buying it, but nothing that has happened in the past 2 years from a functionality standpoint have negatively impacted most of those reasons. iPhone sells because of marketing, and marketing functions because of cash, and AAPL has enough cash.This is the core business - cost leadership through cheaper manufacturing costs. Leveraging the volume of iPhone sales to manufacturers allows the iPhone business to keep sourcing costs very low, and margins very high. iPhone has, since its inception, had the highest profit margin per device than any other mobile device on the market.However, the iPhone business is plateauing - most people who want an iPhone have an iPhone.  Sell a great phone this year, you take away from next year‚Äôs sales. The opportunity cost in the next 10 years of selling an incremental amount of iPhones for x ROI is greater, because emerging technologies force Apple to expand the business via supporting rods through their existing products. Apple made similar decisions in the past few years with some results better than others - Watch is growing along with its margins, but TV‚Äôs value exists mostly in tandem with other products. CarPlay is doing ok, but has a really long payback period - the car business simply can‚Äôt sustain Apple‚Äôs preferred margin level. Over the next 5-10 years Apple will have to prove to investors that it can win at emerging technologies in the same way as iPhone and Apple Watch. In other words, no single stock is safe. If you want a safe investment, diversify. If you like tech, take a look at SHOP, AYX, SQ, Talend, NVDA, AMZN. Most of those have had better 3-year growth than Apple, and also are benefitting from emerging markets.

The hype in buying a phone every single year has slowed down, tho the iPhone X sold pretty good in China. So maybe China is the new main market for Apple?5 years ago we had the iPhone 5 and Siri. Now we have Amazon pushing the boundaries, Google having smartphones and smart home equipment. Tech stocks are always more dangerous than other stocks because new trends keep coming.

But that could happen in next couple of years through AR/AI and then their number one revenue stream could be hit hard. But they have a sticky customer base and still could ride out rough couple of years as long as they have cash to buy a disruptive company. But on the upside I am not sure how much and how fast it can grow considering they are almost a trillion dollar company. So it will be more of a value play than a huge growth play.

ASP is up, wearables including Beats and AirPods make up an interesting revenue source. Apple Music, and other service account for more and more of Apple‚Äôs revenue growth. With an install base of 1.2B users there‚Äôs a real market to focus on revenue expansion. They have a very enviable user base.Re: Apple as a safe investmentI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the safest investment out there. Amongst other reasons: their huge market cap, China/trade issues, possible tech correction. Also compared to a balanced portfolio or strategy which would encompass different risk factors, it‚Äôs clearly more risky to be 100% anything.In a more short term outlook I like AAPL as a stock, and it‚Äôs a very safe investment. Today, it has strong institutional backing, strong dividends, cash on hand, stable and competent leadership, strong brand reputation and a walled garden.Ultimately, any investment must be monitored and adjusted based on market factors. But you guys know that.Tl:dr Apple‚Äôs business is very strong. This question is dumb?
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-17 19:56:15'] MSFT imo
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 05:18:14'] Yes and no.No investments are ever safe.They still have a strong brand, high profits per items etc. Etc.They never try to be fast to market og having the newest tech, but the best tech. And they still seem to manage to do that.But they're also not very diversified. If they lose the iPhone, they more or less loose the company. If fx. Samsung was to loose the phone line, it wouldn't be fun for them. But they would definitely manage. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 07:16:49'] Wait for the crash.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-14 08:23:28'] No. If Apple can't keep selling the volume of phones they've been selling at the high prices they command, their stock price will inevitably fall.The terms "safest investment" and "stocks" don't belong in the same sentence. If you're interested in the "safest stock", I'd suggest looking at Berkshire Hathaway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:52:55'] My opinion is hard disagree.  I haven't seen truly bearish sentiment at all.  People who have been investing for a few years can't recognize bearishness, they seem to think anything slightly negative but true is a "bearish talking point" or "doomsday conspiracy theories."  People cherry pick parts of earnings calls and Jerome speeches and ignore anything slightly negative.  People are complaining out one side of their mouth about not being able to afford life despite having a good job then out the other side screech at anyone who hints a recession is coming is a conspiracy theorist.I have a watch list of close to 200 stocks and none are undervalued right now.  That is almost unprecedented. During "normal" times, a random amount, maybe 10-20% will be in a dip for either no reason or for a made up reason (such as articles that Amazon will enter so and so industry). That's how I made money.  I would think, is there a reason this good company is cheap, not find one, buy it, and it would go up in 6 months.  Now, every darn this is overpriced. Boomer dividend low growth stocks. Tech stocks. Old falling apart used cars in the middle of nowhere.  Dumpy houses in the middle of nowhere in need of expensive repairs.  The economic situation is actually worse in 2008 in the sense that then, broke people bought houses they had no business buying. Now 6-figure earners are struggling to afford basics.I'm also seeing loads of "Q4 earnings was bad but we're raising or keeping high guidance" comments in earnings calls which has me scratching my head.  Do people actually believe all of this? And I'm also never lived through so much skewing of earnings calls.  Like, the market and investors used to just take lower earnings and bad guidance at face value. I also really wish people grasped the "just because someone beat expectations doesn't mean earnings are up" concept.Bear markets end when people who buy "real" companies (not bankrupt companies, not 20 year old tech companies with PEs of 200) get scared and stop buying the freaking dip for two seconds.  I'm watching all of these stocks and the market won't let them drop more than a few percent points. This used to only happen in roaring bull markets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 17:39:09'] We have bottomed, for now. Building up bubbles is bullish. Since we hit the bottom savings have gone down for americans but not for the China, which has gone up.So what is really happening? A alternating series of kicking it down the road, masking of indications, and mini bubble ruptures.However, dollar milkshake theory and the everything bubble exists. As traders, we shouldn‚Äôt be bullish or bearish. Government intervention is not only the reason for the crash but also the reason it doesn‚Äôt crash. Everybody has reason to be bullish or bearish. The market ‚Äúpriced everything in‚Äù is not real. Every bubble is bound to pop eventually so it should go down right? Since it‚Äôs forward looking‚Ä¶..Newsflash, it‚Äôs forward looking to ‚Äúa degree‚Äù. If JPOW says anything other than 25 bps, the market will react, which isn‚Äôt pricing in shit. Even with 25 bps, the market will probably dip. Just because of the mechanics of strengthening the dollar and the algos selling in reaction. If JPOW is dovish, go bullish, if he hawkish, go bearish. Mainly because the economic phenomenon is difficult for anyone to wrap their heads around completely (I‚Äôm studying all the time and keep getting conflicting signals). It is very likely JPOW will screw this up by either being too hawkish or dovish and will overshoot. Just don‚Äôt fight  ‚ÄúTHE MARKETS PERCEPTION OF FED‚Äù. JPOW very commonly ‚Äúspooks‚Äù the market, and the market moves in tandem with JPOW, only for them to, at some random point of good news, start fighting the fed and moving in the opposite directions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 18:27:44'] LOL anything is possible but methinks the market is gonna make a new low below the Oct 13 bottom.The economy is strong, which is inflationary. Even if the economy was to fall into recession the federal reserve will NOT jump in to stem the tide because a recession will bring inflation down. Rates will have to keep going higher and this makes safer investments more appealing and stocks less attractive. ZIRP isn't coming back. Looking at all the facts, it's difficult not to be bearish on equities, which are still due for a reckoning.Equity investors are fighting the fed and that never ends well.

They're doing well with online sales and if a bunch of their competitors go bankrupt and things pick up with shopping they're positioned to have a ton of upside. Risky for sure but I like them. APPL isn't a bad price right now and almost surely is a better bet in the long run, but JWN has a lot more upside in the next year or two for that risk you're paying for.APPL will be a steady gainer but they def have more room to go down.

Seems like you are new, we all had portfolios that have looked like this at some point which is why it is cute to look back on now.I don‚Äôt think you need to go full passive index but for Christ sake load up on an index and make really specific choices for anything else you will buy and only hold a few you follow closely.  Seems like you have just bought every name that retail has piled into at different points throughout the past 3 years, assuming for poor entry prices.Edit: your selection is actually not that bad, I would focus more on concentration if you really want to outperform the index.  It will force you to make higher conviction choices too.I think you won‚Äôt see the hidden expense that comes from cognitive/emotional biases.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 21:05:28'] Honestly, at this point, I feel like they missed their chance and that type of tech is no longer necessary and wouldn‚Äôt be the number one choice for me anyway (I‚Äôm a T1D). I guess the one advantage it has is that users wouldn‚Äôt need to keep paying for sensors or would require insurance or prescriptions which I guess would be good for folks that are borderline diabetic or just want to monitor their blood glucose out of caution but don‚Äôt medically need to and so don‚Äôt want to be forking out extra money.I wear a Libre 3 sensor. It‚Äôs the size of a nickel and barely noticeable on my upper arm. It‚Äôs on me 24/7 (for 2 weeks before needing to be replaced). Doesn‚Äôt need to be charged in those two weeks and is continuously sending information to my phone (and i think it can also send the info to your smartwatch). My phone rings if my sugar is too high or too low (which is great for diabetics scared of not waking up by themselves during a hypoglycaemic event in the middle of the night). The ‚Äúinvasiveness‚Äù of it needing to a have a little wire in my skin is not even noticeable (apart from a little pinch that lasts 10 seconds upon application). Of course if it could be even smaller, that would always be nicer but I really can‚Äôt complain.I wouldn‚Äôt want to rely on an Apple Watch for my glucose monitoring. An Apple Watch needs to be charged regularly. It‚Äôs way bulkier than the sensor on my arm. I‚Äôd have to wear it all the time (playing sports or sleeping or when showering) to get to the same level of monitoring coverage.

POST_TEXT: b'Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.\n\nThe stock market rally cleared some major resistance in the past week.

The fed is going to raise rates again in a few days, & my guess is the rate hike will be higher than what people think & it‚Äôs going to hurt Elon. Falling margins & dropping market share spells out another correction for Tesla stock. I‚Äôm sorry but Tesla was always priced for perfection & it simply fumbled one too many times. LMAO!!

It's real value is somewhere around $90, and I agree that it's not a good buy point atm.    Btw, I'm bullish for $TSLA for long term. It's going to double its revenue by 2026. I wrote a whole bullish analysis on it here [https://www.jika.io/post/7928ec3a-8c11-11ed-8080-800116f9b46e?rdttech](https://www.jika.io/post/7928ec3a-8c11-11ed-8080-800116f9b46e?rdttech)but current valuation is too much.

	COMMENT: ['2019-03-27 22:41:08'] Hindsight is always 20/20.I could TA pretty much anything from historicals and make it sound good. The question is....where will AAPL be in a year or three from now. The company is going through a pretty significant fundamental shift at the moment and investors won't be very impressed unless they can literally replace iPhone revenue with services revenue. If they can't or they guide lower, the stock will downside quarter after quarter.As they say....past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes.We will see.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 11:21:47'] Not surprising. I think that Apple was a tricky bet unless you understood where the tech was going. When the iPhone came out while you can see the potential, there were a lot of unknowns. Still, once iPhone took more marketshare and wireless companies started to finance them for their customers, people should have jumped in. All you have to look at is how many teens use iPhones vs. everything else. They will keep growing.

Wang suggests dropping Meta Platforms and Netflix from the   list and adding Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia to the group.¬†The analyst‚Äôs comments have come amid the underperformance of these mega-cap stocks in 2022. Not only this, the fact that Netflix and Meta   are struggling more than the others to stay relevant to their   stakeholders may have somewhat shaken Wang‚Äôs trust, triggering his   suggestion to drop them from the FAANG list.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 16:29:53'] Since the 1st gen of N3 is not forward compatible with future generations, only Apple will be using it. Rest will wait for 2024 and N3E. Plus SRAM is shrunk only 5% from N5 and A16 SOC had 44MB (L2 + L3). So cost will increase big time for sure unless they reduce the cache. Let us wait for actual chips to release with N3.

Once again, many of those losers fell hard.

As of the close, the Dow Jones was up by 1.17%, the Nasdaq was up by 2.48%, and the S&P was up by 1.76%.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was up by 3.615%, closing at 3.583%, with a spread of -58 basis points compared to the two-year Treasury yield. The VIX dropped 12.05%, Brent crude oil was up by 1.1%, and spot gold continued to rise from November 2022 to the present, with a slight increase of 0.03% yesterday, reaching $1919.3 per ounce. The US dollar index continued to fall from its high position, closing at 104.45.\n\nThe number of people filing for initial jobless claims in the US was lower than expected at 192,000, which suggests that the labor market is still strong despite large tech companies cutting jobs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 08:32:34'] MARA has moved up from a support low this week.. and is starting to break out. Should have some resistance until $9.50-$10 .. then opens up and next natural resistance levels are generally $14, $18, $28. The set up and technicals are very similar to the BBBY squeeze last August (except MARA is a buy rated stock with positive news out & catalyst going forward, and projected to turn profitable this year).. so mo rug pull at $28, like BBBY Aug squeeze. Last time MARA bounced off of support bottom- it quickly ran to $20 (at a time when BTC was lower than currently- was producing considerably leas bitcoin, and not projected to be profitable anytime soon.. and had a lower amount of short interest. So $20 is probably a minimum squeeze target.There is a lot of upside as MARA is just in the initial stage of what will likely be, a week or two squeeze.Yesterday fintel showed "0" shares available. Over 40M short interest. The squeeze has been building fir over a month, so there's a stable base that isn't selling**

POST_TEXT: b"Hi guys, \n\nJust a quick question - I've googled and have seen conflicting opinion on whether YF automatically adjusts your share prices and number of shares when the split happens. Other's have said it is done automatically, others say it takes place at the end of the day instead of the morning, and some have said it doesn't do it automatically because the platform is crap - instead you will have to adjust it yourself. \n\nIf I was to do this over on my mobile, do I simply just sell my latest lot on Friday's closing price and rebuy a new lot with this morning's price with a 4 to 1 share increase? Right now my day's performance for the stock has plunged by thousands of dollars but it's very obvious that it thinks its share price went from 499 overnight to 126 so it looks like the system isn't updated. \n\nAny insight on the above would be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks"

POST_TEXT: b'Airline companies that are highly unlikely to go bankrupt such as Southwest currently offer safer stocks than tech companies such as Apple, and here is why: \n\nAAPL has recovered incredibly quickly and was briefly back at all time high yesterday ($320). Going forward, if more bad than good news come, it has a long way to fall (it hit $224 on March 23). If more good than bad news come, realistically it only has a minor potential climb in the near future. \n\nLUV is probably somewhere close to bottom. Its been falling steadily for the past month but similar, slightly riskier stocks like DAL have been relatively flat for a while now and LUV will be too as it finds its way to the bottom. Its taken a little longer for LUV to fall because Southwest is a healthier company than Delta, financially. Going forward, if more bad than good news come, LUV wont fall much further. If more good than bad news come, it can climb very high. \n\nThoughts?'

Someone told me earlier that retail investors only exist to get r\*ped by algos and major players. I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started "investing." The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  edit: downvoted for being a loser i already know

It takes awhile for the bad policies to kick in and consumer confidence to go down!! Basically right now the federal reserve owns the stock market and the demonicrats are robbing it blind!! With over 31 trillion in debt they have to rob something!! They used to rob social security!! But there's nothing left to rob there either now!!! Sooo, the pirates are calling the shots, robbing from one end and giving it to another, like big corporate pharmacies, chemical and electronic industries!! And the rest in their pockets!!

POST_TEXT: b''
	COMMENT: ['2016-09-13 08:33:08'] Whodathunkit? The lone bright green box on today's market map is none other than the fruit itself (AAPL)! ... not too shabby! lolOne thing is for sure, market volatility is FINALLY back in a big way after months and months of sideways chop!It's no secret that this was looooooonnnnnggg overdue! Welcome to September! :)That said, we still don't exactly have a decisive trend in either direction yet ... yes we're seeing large moves up and down the past few days but we're still technically contained within the summer range ... can't get too terribly crazy until some important support levels get taken out ... the prior ATH at 2134 was a step in the right direction for the bears but we've been kind of battling that area ... 2100-ish would be another area ... then of course BREXIT lows which I don't know that we quite make it down that far (yet) but that would be a helluva move if we got down there again.Whatever you think the catalyst is "this time" for today's reversal (fed speakers flip flopping hawkish again?) it really doesn't matter ... this market has been absolutely begging for a move in either direction for months now ... so it looks like its finally decided it wants to resolve itself lower for the time being ... and boy is this refreshing to see IMO! Volatility is a traders dream! The sideways choppy range bound market we had been in for nearly 2 months was to put it midly -- horrific!Nothing wrong with some downside action in a bull market ... Until some major levels get taken to the downside the the jury is still out on this pullback that we're seeing ... in other words this is all still innocent until proven guilty so-to-speak ... just cant get too crazy here, but it is potentially the start of something much bigger ... we shall see!I hope everyone is holding out okay today? :)Happy turnaround (on the downside this time) Tuesday r/StockMarket! :)EDIT: And just for the record -- after all that we've seen over the past 3 trading days with the sizeable moves that we've seen -- the S&P is basically FLAT for the week (and yes I realize we're only on day 2 of the week here!). And still only off about 2.8% or thereabouts from ATH just to put some perspective on it lol.

Close friend of mine bought at the top 127 or so a year ago been feeling for him all year lol. Could have got a much better position , but hindsight is 20/20.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 23:22:08'] Not watching the news I guess. Fun fact, we are, if not already, heading toward a recession. Things might get worse before they get better pal. Probably best to DCA now and feel better in 3 years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 23:08:47'] That was better than a S&P 500 index.  Relatively speaking you did OK. Most Redditors lost a lot more caught by the demise of high tech or growth stocks.If you can keep more in bonds or into fixed income, you will reduce the repeating error. All the best.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 00:58:36'] I would suspect the best starting point is DD on what your getting into. To give you some context , I read around for about a month before any swing trade. Trading in shorter terms is just momentum trading in my opinion , so how do you get out of a down turn? Is there any likelihood or rebound? Can you add more and buy short term troughs and trade out at the peaks ? But either way you have some studying to do if you want to get out of this one

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 07:19:42'] Keep in mind that every time you received a credit, you average cost is reduced as well. I believe Robinhood doesn‚Äôt reflect that. Calculate how much credit have you received in total, do avg cost - credit and you will find your new BE, that way you will be able to roll down your strikes and capture more credit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 08:40:06'] You bought tech stocks in this climate. Tech stocks always move the most and in a bad market you will lost more more money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-07 11:01:45'] You‚Äôve only lost 16.37% this year? That‚Äôs good. It means you‚Äôre on par with the market.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-14 19:30:51'] As opposed to buying individual stocks at this point I feel like it‚Äôd be better to put all your money in a large cap growth etf
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-14 20:38:07'] First of all good for you. But think about putting it into an ETF. VTI or even QQQ  since that would have all of those except BABA. Just remember corrections will happen. It's easy to say that you you won't sell but if your investment is down 50% in a year it means there is major panic over something. You are young so even a decade of stocks falling every year would be to your advantage if you keep buying. No one knows the future but if things don't correct themselves in 30 or 40 years you have a lot more to worry about than the money you put in. 99% chance staying the course and keep buying would be the best thing you can do.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-14 23:04:58'] Given your age you can take on more risk but it all depends on you. The rule of thumb is diversify. It may not net you as much profit but you have time working in your favor. Understand the ETF you are investing in if you choose that route. However, if you would like to invest specifically in one company. Do your due diligence and compare the potential growth/ dividend yield.

	COMMENT: ['2016-11-24 19:47:21'] A company with such a brand identity like Apple shouldn't need to advertise a whole lot, right? If I saw a major uptick in advertising cost, I would assume it was because of faltering sales. Maybe I'm dumb.

People are learning there are no "safe" stocks.When these stocks tank it will be a sign of retail trader capitulation which is a requisite for an overall capitulation in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2017-08-01 17:32:41'] As a long holder since 2009, this is a nice bounce, but it's really barely over previous highs.Long term stays the same for me, Apple's biggest risk is lack of diversification and they're fixing that (slowly, I'd like to see it happen faster). If anything I worry once we make this last big advancement in obvious screen improvements, that all phone makers are out of in-your-face-must-upgrade level features to add. We'll continue to see phone technology plateau into maturity. Apple needs to be moving beyond this.

	COMMENT: ['2019-01-28 09:36:46'] AMZN definitely. They have shown they can be a player in basically any industry. AAPL I'd be a little more worried about. They've pulled themselves out of holes before, but they aren't as innovative as they once were and I'd be worried about people's brand loyalty with so many new competitors. Also, whenever we do get a recession, I wonder how many people are still gonna be buying their premium prices.
	COMMENT: ['2019-01-28 16:46:21'] Apple‚Äôs core business is iPhones.  Even their other lines of business (service, warranty, watches, AppStore) are all directly tied to iPhones.  Even Mac sales are heavily driven by people developing apps.  I know a lot of people that have an iPhone and an iPad.  I know very few people that have an iPad alone.So Apple needs to come up with something new to drive growth.  We have reached peak smartphones and this means all players in smartphones will now see margins squeezed in the coming years.  I like Apple products.  I have an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.  In facts I have more than one of each.  That doesn‚Äôt mean I think their stock is worth buying right now.Apple‚Äôs is supposedly going to go into the video streaming business.  My concern there is that space is going to get very crowded in the next few years.  Seems like everyone is planning a new streaming service.‚Äî I think Amazon will eventually recover.

Numbers won't be *bad* just not complete hype inducing. Those prices are competitive after all, the profit margins are going to be lower than normal. Intel subsequently will issue a price cut to catch up and compete. After that AMD stock starts going back to their old ways unless they come out with some sort of GPU dedicated towards the Machine Learning backend market to compete with Nvidia's domination in the space. Would expect some sort of VR announcement in the pipeline for a mid/low tier competitor in the space but won't amount to much on the stock. At least not this year.Overall buy next 3 months. Hold after that if they don't massively fuck up execution. Needs to be kept an eye on though.

Likely going to rally through December, experiencing a year end selloff for a week and then rally through the new year and through Q1 ER\'s.\n* FOMC to taper rate hike increases (last press conference confirmed this) to 50 basis points, maybe 25, maybe 0 after, then possibly a cut early next year\n* FOMC will gauge market health by summer to match with QT effects and if the market is healthy they will increase rates rapidly. 100-200 basis points in a second wave to nuke inflation\n* If the market survives this Q3 2023 and later we\'re in the best bull market we\'ve ever seen.\n* If the labor market tanks at any point between now and then FOMC will cut rates\n* If there is a market crash, it\'s destined for Spring-Summer 2023 to find lower lows. Market must be "illiquid" '
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 08:50:00'] Nice research.  My question is the bttom point.  If Dec rate of 50 basis is priced in.  I do not expect much changes until we hear that we are turning around.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 09:21:00'] You think we can have bull run with no QE and highest rates in 15 years? With most people barely able to afford to keep up with cost of living increase and energy prices likely driving inflation further? None of this is possible. The bull run of the past 20 years was created with low rates and free $. We now pay the consequences. There is NO WAY to stop inflation without deep recession as we have to destroy labor market to stop wage inflation. Recession should last through 2024 (just like in Europe ). Housing, coins, all stocks which don‚Äôt make $ should crash as people with no jobs will be forced to liquidate. The fed will eventually cut rates due to recession but it‚Äôs too late. 2025 we start over and rebuild. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we hit bottom sometime end of next year at around s and p 2700, which would be in line with other bear markets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 10:45:05'] In response to the first picture, it‚Äôs going to take something strange or significant occurring for the S&P to trade 4600 in the next 12-13 months honestly. The closest we got to it making sense was in August where it looked like rates were going to wind up back in the multi-decade downtrend, then the massive jawboning by the Fed started, which caused some major whiplash there (I didn‚Äôt expect 4600 to come in a straight line at that point, but in the remote world where it did occur it‚Äôd have been near the end of the year or early next).The best case is likely 4300 unless the long-end winds up back under 3 and I feel like there‚Äôs essentially a 0% chance of this occurring without some bad crap going down, and if the bad crap takes it under, the S&P is not trading 4600 in that scenario.If October was it for a few months, I think 4100 can trade again before EoY, but it‚Äôs just as likely that October was just like July and the S&P ends up at 3400 or something on December 31st. In a world where we‚Äôre at 4100 or at the very least, 3490ish sticks as the low for 2022, I think Q1 next year marks the low.But if 3490ish doesn‚Äôt stick, the odds of a secular bear get pretty high, so all of the averages double bottom with their COVID lows in the first half of 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 15:09:36'] Great analysis man. Keep it up...!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 17:54:02'] Thanks for the comment. Market is still very bearish, but it‚Äôs just liquid enough to ward off a year end crash. However this can change in a moment‚Äôs notice ‚Äî new CFTC positional data can cause me to abandon my thesis so I‚Äôll update if that flags!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 13:56:37'] Won‚Äôt matter to me, I‚Äôm DCAing for the next 30-40yrs before I bother caring about the short term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:17:46'] Thank you very much for this very complete analysis!It makes a lot of sense for me. Even though the indexes chart were telling me to look for a larger rally, I couldn't find more reason to back my thesis than "trust the chart, the fundamentals will just happen at the right time". This is much appreciated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 11:05:40'] I actually just went long this last week on the Q's/beat up tech because I believe something similar. I just .don't think the market can crash right now (without a black swan event) because we just have too much liquidity... I also think that rates have topped for the rest of the year before they move higher in '23. Then I believe the Dollar is about to cool off as well and all of this will allow tech room to rally and breath, before it's clear that the recession is actually here and earnings are negative. So I think somewhere in between Q1/Q2 of '23 is when the market actually bottoms. As a side note: Markets usually make new highs after yield curve inversions but before the recession hits... So I could see this playing out similarly where we go on a crazy strong rally into EOY... I just don't see new highs... but perhaps the Dow could make a new high, while SPY and Q's underperform... just like what we have seen recently
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 14:13:18'] How would an imminent collapse in treasuries or housing affect this thesis?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 18:35:14'] What Jerome powell actually said:  "I don‚Äôt see the case for real softening just yet" (talking about the labor market)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 19:58:46'] Great research! Provides some nice  insights onthe current market. From Powell's transcript,  there are still billions of spending awaiting to be injected into the economy. ( Chips act, bipartisan , ) Powell been slow playing the game, easing investors into high rate environment.  Inflation is around 6.6% in September.(this is excluding food and energy data as well, otherwise would be higher) Even if Powell increase rate by 75 basis pts in december, fed rate is still much much too low. Powell emphasized again on how firm they are in maintaining 2% inflation. The expectation of rate increase during this round was 4.4% next year, now after this latest update, market is expecting 5+ %. Notice how they are slowly raising the expectation? How does this impact our economy? Aside from what op said about liquid and dealers holding the bag.... All sorts of debts we are seeing.  30 year housing rate is at 7% right now  (highest since 2002) and mortgage application have crashed to the bottom.(lowest since 1997)  This directly translates to housing crisis in the making. (Those who does Airbnb arbitrage will probably suffer the most.). Moreover, the housing sales so far ONLY dropped by 25% comparing to last year.  (This is not even shown on the government's inflation data.) Powell have been dodging all the serious questions about these impact not being captured on the CPI/PCE data. The housing data they have collects only rent and etc.... Doesn't even touch the housing price. (Supporting data is from Bureau of labor statistics using their shelter index to measure the cost of housing for both renters and the homeowners. "Focuses on the rent tenant pays and how much the rent equivalent would be if home owner rented a party similar to their own."  This is ridiculous method as it would experience huge delay and cannot capture the REAL housing data in real time. .....to put it into perspective, if housing price crashes but not to the point it impacts the rental price, their data will not even acknowledge of the housing crash. Powell is not done yet. All these cover ups or purposely NOT mentioning/excluding critical data leads me to believe ..... It's still too early to dca into "value companies." There may very well be some fake rallies done by these so called "dealers" so they can find bag holders (retail investors) then they'll find positions to take advantage again. Oh right. Midterm election. Lol I dunno if that's not market manipulation , what is.  Anyway, fake rallies, then at least one or two more big drop in the market. Ps Volker back in the days curbed their inflation of like 14% or something by raising rate to 20%. If Powell is so adament on curbing the inflation this time, I'm pretty sure interest rate will have to be much higher than current rate.

Too much smart money has money to buy and waiting for the suckers to capitulate. Things are going to get worse, (oil in the 60‚Äôs) unemployment shooting higher ( fear of over compensating) and while interest rates won‚Äôt shoot too much higher ( depends on the Fed being stupidly stubborn ) we are in a downward economic cycle that will wash everyone back to normal prices.

POST_TEXT: b'What is everyones thoughts on MSFT closing today as the largest company by market cap? \n\nI find it interesting that MSFT has about the same dividend yield (approx 1.7%) as AAPL but over twice the payout ratio (44% to 21%), and AAPL has the larger dividend growth YoY.  Add in the facts that AAPL net profit is $40B more than MSFT and crushes MSFT on almost all financial metrics, it makes me think the market has either priced MSFT too high or AAPL too low at the moment. \n\nIve wrote options to have AAPL placed to me at $170 and feeling really good about it. Anyone else playing with me? Against me?\n\nEdit: Its been pointed out that MSFT did not actually pass AAPL in market cap as Google Finance indicates. Yahoo finance has the more accurate figures with up to date share counts that has MSFT $26B lower than AAPL. Still, the gap is incredibly tight in my opinion given the very different financial profiles of the two companies. MSFT could easily make the pass next week. '
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-23 19:45:22'] Not playing with or against you. Thinking MSFT was placed too high today...But once again, this week has been very peculiar in terms of the top market cap companies. I think that option that you made was a smart one. Dividends are a solid idea right now.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-24 23:59:32'] On a side note. They‚Äôre closely valued but when you look at profits Apple has made about three times the profits that Microsoft has. MSFT has a pretty high PE. It is growing quickly though so maybe justified. A PE of 44 is high for a $800B company though imo 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-24 04:31:06'] You have to remember the market is driven by future growth
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-24 23:56:56'] MSFT did not pass Apple in market cap. Google finance says that it has but does not take I to account share count changes. Yahoo finance or brokerage is more accurate 
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-26 14:28:59'] MSFT is probably in a tech bubble right now. AAPL looks very conservative and immunized in comparison.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 16:22:49'] Yes, price traded lower today across all the majors; however, price still remains within the micro-trend's bullish consolidation zone. I provided a brief technical analysis on [SPY](https://stocktwits.com/PrecisionSwingTrader/message/498279743) and [QQQ](https://stocktwits.com/PrecisionSwingTrader/message/498292941) heading into the week; in short, nothing that occurred today impacted this analysis -- and in terms of upside potential -- could even be viewed as a positive. That said, even if this bullish consolidation does breakout to the upside, it will be limited due to so much resistance over head.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 07:31:24'] Buying hype stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 13:38:04'] Doing a lot wrong.Read my investing bible1. Buy good companies with strong financial statements.  Companies with low debt, and companies that show a trend of growing and increased net income and revenue. Once you understand how to read a financial statement, you can make 70% of your decision to buy based on the financial statement, even before knowing what the company is. 2. Only buy companies that has a competitive advantage, one that would be had for another company to overtake them.  A company where you can envision that 50 years from now, they will still be relevant. 3. Buy undervalued companies.  There are many companies out there with great financial statements, a trend of growth, but the price must be right.  For example, Amazon shows consistent growth, but at their current price and how much net income they are bringing in and P/E ratio, it will take many decades for them to make enough money to warrant that current price evaluation. 4. You only need a few very good companies to get rich.  People that diversify don‚Äôt know what they are doing, so they try to mitigate risk.  But to get wealthy, you go all in only a few stocks that you have thoroughly researched and meets all the criteria stated above.  People that get very rich, they do it off only a few stocks.  You want all your money in a good company where when it moves, it moves in a big way.  Enough to move the needle. 5. Have a strategy, once you know the top 5 companies you are going to invest in, the price fluctuation doesn‚Äôt matter as much anymore.  It will go up and down periodically, but each time it goes down, you need to buy more.  Load up as much as you can when the price is low.  You are betting on your research and confidence that 10 years from now this company will grow many folds.  It‚Äôs hard to predict in the short term whether a stock going to go up or or down, but I can predict with high certainty that a stock will go up in 10 years.   6. Stock investing is simple.  If a company is profitable and consistently brings in profit, the stock will grow and so will your money. 7. Ignore the micro / temporary issues in society.  For example, covid, new politician, fear of war, Ukraine invasion etc.  All this does not matter, it‚Äôs only temporary. A good company that historically shown to make profits and grow, they will overcome and continue to grow the long run. 8. Do not invest money if you need the money in the short run.  For example you need the money in a week a month or even a year.  Stock investing is long run, most big profits are made in year 6 or higher.  You need to be able to buy and hold for 10 years to see substantial increases. 9. Do not invest in speculative stocks.  Don‚Äôt invest in the story, for example ‚Äúmarijuana stocks‚Äù is the future, or electric cars or renewable energy is the future.  Only invest in companies that you can check their financial statement and see they have a trend of growth.  Not saying to invest in well established companies that are profitable, but you need to find a company that you look at the financial statements and pick up a trend of growth.  NIO is an example of a good stock that has shown growth.  Although they are still not in the green on net income yet, they show a trend of increasing revenue each year, closing the gap on the net income to be profitable and each year they are producing more cars and expanding their markets.   10. Remove the prejudice in your investing strategy.  Don‚Äôt be prejudice because you don‚Äôt like investing in oil, or because it‚Äôs from China you don‚Äôt like Chinese people, or you don‚Äôt like investing in companies that start with the letter A.  All that does not matter, you are here to make money.   Invest wisely by analyzing the financial statement and where the trajectory of that company is going. 11. Never sell a stock when it‚Äôs low.  If you invest in good companies stated above, these companies has always recovered and increase their stock price significantly after the turmoil.   12. Invest in companies that has room to grow.  Think of stock investing like how many innings in a baseball game.  Ask yourself, where is this company now, is it in the 1st inning or is it in the 9th inning.  For example Amazon, ask yourself where is this company at in it‚Äôs life, is this company now fully matured, do they still have room to grow? In my opinion, Amazon is near the full maturity stage, it‚Äôs in the 7th inning, there‚Äôs not much more room for it to expand or grow.  But Alibaba, is the 2nd biggest competitor to Amazon, and it shows a great financial statement and the trajectory of it to grow is still quite high.  They are consistently getting more active user each year and the market they are in, which is China still has a lot of room to grow. 13. Do not options trade, it‚Äôs gambling.  It‚Äôs hard to predict a stock going up or down in the short run.  To ensure high probability of success, buy good, undervalued companies and hold long run.     Written by Ethan Lee

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 14:56:03'] You are buying/holding stocks that heavily depend on cheap capital for their expansion - this is an excellent strategy when interest rates are near zero.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 06:55:46'] I would balance out the big tech stocks. Amazon looks to be a heavy percentage.I would swap out VUG for VTIAnd I would scrap Intel / Rivian . Intel is trending downwards, if your doing it for growth I think AMD/NVIDIA/TSMC is a way better play, especially at the current valuations. And it seems like your portfolio is heavy growth so I don‚Äôt know if you care much about the dividend yield. Not very bullish on Rivian, but also not to read up on them. So I can‚Äôt speak to that company as much. But my ignorant perspective is that there are much better, unprofitable risky stocks than Rivian. (Personally I like SOFI at these prices) Would probably scrap Berkshire too and put that money into some of the big tech or VTI. Doesn‚Äôt really fit the overall portfolio IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2015-03-20 19:38:08'] Today was the rebalance day for multiple indexes. AAPL had a 13m share sell imbalance at 15:50 which caused the price to fall out in the last 10 minutes as the imbalance was paired off.

	COMMENT: ['2015-03-20 13:54:50'] At 3:45 you could've bought 127 puts for $0.01 and exercised them for 125.16 to make 18,300% gain in 10 minutes.Put that in perspective every 500$ you spent on the trade above would net you around 92,000$ in 10 minsSo time travel is fairly valuable apparentlyEdit: to answer your question probably options expiry today or some algo shit
	COMMENT: ['2015-03-20 14:03:10'] Apparently 126 was the strike being fought over today.  I assumed it would be 125, but it makes sense.  If 127 was the high play and 125 was the low, 126 would be the pin.AAPL is the largest holding in so many extremely giant funds that it's only natural to see awesome activity in the last hour of trading on a triple witching.

	COMMENT: ['2015-03-20 19:05:49'] That's called Pinning. The market makers "Pin" an equity price to a level that pays them the most money and forces the largest amount of option contracts to expire worthless or panic sell for a huge loss to the contract holder. However, AAPL was not an isolated incident by any stretch ...but there was an insider selling too: Apple CFO Luca Maestri sold 10,823 shares of the company's stock on the open market in a transaction that occurred on Wednesday, March 18th. The shares were sold at an average price of $128.82, for a total transaction of $1,394,218.86. The sale was disclosed in a legal filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission...I say Pinning
	COMMENT: ['2015-03-20 14:19:52'] It's expiration Friday. This is the same company that's closed at $500.00 (pre stock split) in the past.
POST: ['2022-10-28 17:38:38'] POST TITLE: b'Is Warren Buffet really that good? Berkshire vs S&P500'
POST_TEXT: b"I've been fascinated with Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffet for as long as I could remember. The more I study the market though, the more I ask... Is Warren Buffet really that good? He's made a name for himself as one of the best investors of all time, but interestingly his flagship fund BRK-B doesn't even outperform SPY over the past 10 years and barely outperforms since its inception. I'm genuinely curious, why would someone own Berkshire stock instead of the S&P? With AAPL making up 40% of Berkshire, it seems like a massive amount of trust in one company. So you have increased risk with AAPL making up such a big piece of the pie and very little upside advantage, BRK-B doesn't seem like a good trade-off to me. So if you can create a fund that barely beats the S&P over the long term, does that earn you the title of greatest investor of all time? I feel like so much of Berkshire's gain come from them simply announcing that they took a position in XYZ company, which results in an imm"
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 19:14:27'] AAPL is just where he has parked a bunch of cash that he didn't have anywhere better to put it at the time.Buffett/Berkshire have just gotten so big that they have problems finding ways to deploy all the money that is generated every quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 05:16:42'] The answer is that Buffett is over 90 years old, the last 10 years are hardly representative of his career. If you further behind than 10 years, you will see that Berkshire absolutely eviscerated the market.SPY since its inception in January 1993 has gained 785%. BRK since January 1993 has gained 3,795%.The further you go back the starker the difference. If we from 1982, then we'll get 2,817% gain for the S&P 500 but a whopping 67,855% for BRK. (your money would have multiplied over 678x, a multi-hundred-bagger)Early investors in the company got filthy rich.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 22:20:54'] A lot of the businesses Berkshire owns are private companies that generate an exhorbant amount of profit. It's not just a holding company that invests. They legitimately run businesses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 18:50:00'] Fun fact: Berkshire could lose 99% of its value and still be beating the S&P since inception.So, yes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 17:39:47'] bacause the more diversified you are, the more average your returns will be..Buffett would probably answer your question like that: "Why put money in your second best idia?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 23:54:57'] AAPL is only the part of the investment pie chart..BRK also owns a whole bunch of other private companies such as See's candy, Railway, Insurance etc...
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 18:58:07'] The story of Buffet is that he was crushing the s&p500 in the 70s and earlier. Charlie came along in late 70s and convinced Warren they were too big to keep up the style of buying and trading valuations that Warren was doing simply because of their size. So since 80s and on they have only beat the s&p marginally because of the switch in strategy‚Ä¶the return is still better. I do agree the large Apple risk is a problem.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 20:33:53'] During Q2 -Q3 many investors pulled out of SPY specifically invest in less volitle stocks BRK were favorable because it was less volatitle 10% less risk than Standard & Poor.s&p 500    vs.                                           brk\_b returnsytd            -18%                                            +6.7%YTY         -14.2%                                          +4.3%3 yr         +10.2%                                         +36.1%Never mind last 10 years the long growth cycle was over last Nov 2021. It has been  almost 1 year by now into a new phase.Now we have been through part of a decline cycle. It will take months to cross over zero line.Do you find another index that produce positive returns consistently ?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:27:30'] I read in another thread that AAPL is effectively ~20% of Berk‚Äôs portfolio rather than 40%, once you factor in their ownership of privately held companies like Geico.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 18:43:08'] I think most people look at the Medallion Fund and Jim Simons as the best all time with over 60% annual return. Maybe look at Buffett as most successful value investor with an average return of 20% annually.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 16:14:16'] If you‚Äôre going to cherry pick and choose only the last 10 years than SP500 will beat Berkshire.Go back further to 1994 and Berkshire is ahead of SP500 by a huge margin. 10k invested in Berkshire back than is now worth 272k while a 10k investment in SPY is worth 140k (includes dividend reinvested and assumes no tax was payed on dividends)
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 03:53:59'] He‚Äôd average 30%+ if he had a normal amount of money a few millions.

But this year he‚Äôs killing the S&P.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 21:09:10'] Im not able to buy BRK/B on Fidelity. Anyone else have this issue?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 05:23:29'] If you are just looking at current prices, then you don't understand Warren Buffet. He doesn't care about the daily ups and downs of the market.His philosophy is centered around don't lose money, so outperforming S&P also isn't the goal. He also said repeatedly that his expected performance can't be super great, because of the size of allocated capital.BRK hasn't been doing so well because a lot of the special magic of Buffet has already been priced in since years and decades. Personally, I try to buy "Buffet-stocks" at a similar price than him. It has been amazing for OXY.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 17:55:38'] Most outperformance comes from smaller companies. The problem is he has too much money to invest in those companies without buying the company outright. So he's relegated to investing in large caps where you will generally get the same performance as the market. Also, 10 years in not long term. Dude has been investing for over 80 years. And he has a CAGR >20% which is double the S&P. His track record speaks for itself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 04:05:02'] I think also he only has stocks that pay dividents

	COMMENT: ['2018-12-21 16:50:15'] You can keep posting this but it makes no sense. He said the iPhone is underpriced for the value it gives the consumer. That‚Äôs it; it was a statement about how great the iPhone is.That statement has no relation to Apples stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2017-09-20 08:57:16'] Coming off a bit more aggressively from that $160 level here...Rumors swirling around that apparently there is a connectivity issue with the new Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatch.**Apple admits issues with Apple Watch connectivity, stock falls**[SOURCE](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-admits-issues-with-apple-watch-connectivity-stock-falls-2017-09-20)> Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.41% shares declined Wednesday morning after the tech company reportedly admitted there are issues with connectivity of its new Apple Watch Series 3. The new Apple smartwatch is the first to connect to cellular networks on its own, without having to be electronically tethered to an iPhone, but reviewers had issues staying connected while reviewing the new device. According to The Verge, Apple admitted an issue in an official statement, saying, "We have discovered that when Apple Watch Series 3 joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks without connectivity, it may at times prevent the watch from using cellular. We are investigating a fix for a future software release." The new Apple Watch, which costs at least $399 for versions with a cellular connection, opened for preorders last Friday and will begin reaching customers Sept. 22. Apple stock fell more than 1% in early trading Wednesday, and is down 0.4% in the past month, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.02% has gained 3.3%.AAPL is accounting for at least a 30-point drag on the Dow Industrials thus far today.To BTFD or not to BTFD that is the question.
	COMMENT: ['2017-09-21 06:35:02'] Surprising little activity since unveiling the iPhone X on September 12th. As much as a $5 drop so far today. Here's a link on [StockChartLab](HTTP://stockchartlab.com?ticker=AAPL)
