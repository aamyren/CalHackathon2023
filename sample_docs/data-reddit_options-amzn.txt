POST_TEXT: b'Hoping someone with a bit more experience than me can provide some insight into what the charts are predicting will happen week of 2/13..\n\nHave some contracts for GOOGL & AMZN exciting 2/17 with a strike price of $103 for each.. what are the chances the market returns around and Im able to see (at the very least) my money back? Or even some potential profits.\n\nWould love to see both come back over $100 (I know its a stretch for google) but thoughts?\n\nAMZN average cost: $1.75\nGOOGL average cost: $0.69'
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:13:55'] Nobody can predict next week. Anything can happen. But probability is if we have no hugely directional week you will lose your money. You should have an stop losses, or exit strategy before you place a buy order. If you don’t have one now, sell it all and come back in when you have a hypothesis and an a point where your hypothesis was proven wrong. Waiting and hoping while your positions burns away is not a strategy and you will not last trading that way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:57:50'] Im thinking last week was top with these kind of questions
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 07:57:58'] Option deltas give a very rough approximation for expiring in the money. For AMZN to get to 104 approximately 17 percent. For GOOGL approximately 6 percent. This is at expiration and only a very rough estimate for your chances at profit. Do you like the odds? Probably not, but go in with eyes open.Your choices are to take the loss (my vote), ride until the CPI or to expiration, or perhaps add capital by rolling out in time. Riding to the end or adding to a loser are popular choices with gamblers (the majority on this sub) and tend to lead to losing everything at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 06:25:21'] Charts don't predict prices. They merely show what has happened up to the present. Traders try to predict prices using a variety of tools, but it isn't an exact science. We merely try to move the odds in our favour. With that out of the way... AMZN has likely  completed an upward 2 legged corrective pattern on 2 Feb. It's longer term trend is still bearish, and it has now likely resumed its bearish trend. You may be lucky and get a quick bounce to about 105, but it'll be brief so grab it quickly if it happens.GOOGL is a little harder to read right now. If I had to guess I'd say it is still in an upward  corrective pattern (the second leg) with some support around current levels. So you might see some higher highs in the short term. Longer term, however, odds are in favour of it also resuming a bearish trend along with the tech sector (and perhaps the market) as a whole.I could be wrong. Not an exact science, etc etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 10:57:18'] I would suggest you learn some of the factors that influence the price of a stock before you start trading options. Even if you win big off the start, not knowing what you’re doing plus trading options will almost certainly result in a blunder that will cost you big money. Start with investopedia and go from there, no shame asking google the absolute basic questions
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 06:03:50'] Remindme! 2/17
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 10:06:54'] Stock price * IV % for expiration * sqrt(dte/365) That's the expected move in either direction right now.  So add that to the stock price today and that's the max expected move within 1 std dev ... If you're outside that you're outside probability.  Outside you could roll out in time but might not be worth it... If you're defined risk, this is exactly why you defined your risk.  If you pick a direction with defined risk and you get the direction wrong... That's kinda it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 10:19:44'] What are the deltas of these strikes?  They will give you the probabilities of being ITM/OTM at expiration.There is no way ANYONE can tell what the market will do, but delta will give the best estimate.  This is such a simple concept . . .

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-12 11:28:47'] I assume you mean these are long positions, not short, i.e., you bought the contracts. Unfortunately, these options are significantly OTM and theta decay in their last week is going to devalue them fast. You will need to take action soon if you don't want to lose all your premiums.  It's not that your ship has sunk so much as it has sailed away on you, and you will need to either find another boat or just vote yourself off the island.Among your choices:* sell them all at a loss - putting it behind you can often be the least aggravating* vertical spread - i.e., sell, not buy, the same options with the same expiry dates and use the calls to secure them.  Selling won't get much you much money at this point but the options expiring OTM will at least secure the smaller premium you collected in them and offset the loss.* roll them out - later expiry date, perhaps with a lower strike price.  Make sure they're cheaper than what you paid for the original ones.  Don't chase good money after bad here - buy them for less than what you paid for these original ones.* mix, match, or combine the above if you have +1 options of either.* prayer never hurts. :)Remember that CPI figures will be announced on Tuesday 2/14 at 8:30am ET, so you might consider holding onto your decisions until then and see what the equities do.Aside:  I actually sold the same AMZN option you bought as a covered call, and will likely close it on Monday so I don't have to wait through a potential bump.  Your gain is my loss if that happens. :) Also, I don't have options on GOOGL.  I bought a few shares a few days ago on a limit order that was executed at $100 but now I see the price is at $94.  I would hate having so far OTM options in your position.All in all, I'd say you're going to lose something - the question is how much.  If you had another week, I'd say try riding your position a little longer but it's not at all likely you'll overcome your theta headwind with only 5 trading days left.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-13 14:26:40'] I've been selling weekly covered calls on GOOGL for over a year now. This week, I decided not to sell, because I didn't feel like the prices for options was worth the risk, and I think it would too easily be called, since I feel that googl is due for a bounce. I wanted to sell calls with a strike of 102, but they were so cheap I didn't bother... I will wait until next week&#x200B;No idea about amazon, I do not own any amzn and don't plan on buying a position in them any time soon&#x200B;\*disclaimer - I am not a true options trader, I just sell covered calls

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 10:37:19'] I rarely trade these names before earnings, but GOOG, AMZN and AAPL look priced for perfection to me.Not wanting to step in front of a steamroller, I bought 1 ATM 2/3/23 puts in each. I rarely do this, but all three are pushing the top of the daily Bollinger Band, which I would expect after an earnings release that is positive, not before.  Of course, I can be completely wrong and will lose 100% of my trade from today.  Time will tell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 11:03:22'] I’m a big believer in understanding probabilities and regression to the mean, hence my heavy reliance on BB.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-07 08:41:35'] When its hot or in cool condition, then RSI wont matter. Meaning, it continues to stay elevated in undersold or oversold territory. There are many unknown in coming days. Midterm election, Policy change (spending and war funding to Ukraine, priorities for particular sector), CPI, etc will play a huge roll plus historically December will be down months due to tax loss harvesting. If Gop takes both chamber then spending will be non existent, meaning its no guarantee that Jan onwards its normal etc. its gambling but may be its prudent to try small to see what happens. At the end of the day, what you have in your hand is better than what is in the bush. Also true that no risk and no reward :-)

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 18:49:23'] If you’re new, that one is too rich for your experience level.  However, you might still wish to buy long calls or puts.  That can be looked up fairly easily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 08:10:32'] Just buy shares through DCA. Even if you only can buy 1 share a month, that's fine. Solves all of the problems of not knowing when the recovery will happen vs. theta decay, as long as you are really confident in your long-term bullish forecast.Fractional share brokerages are perfect for this situation. You can spend $50/month and DCA 100 delta exposure for 100% of your holding time with no theta decay.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 21:45:06'] Dude forget options, just buy shares and thank me 30 years from now. You have what is likely a once in a lifetime chance to own Amazon at these prices. This is a company that outside of recessionary conditions is making $25 BILLION a year in net income, expected to do $500 billion in revenue this year and $560 billion next year AND STILL PROJECTED TO CONTINUE GROWING at an incredible clip. You’re paying about $900 billion for a company that has the best e-commerce, and cloud opportunity of any company in the world going into the future and is already the undisputed king in these sectors. MOAT? Think of what it would take for a competitor to come in and compete with them, the billions in infrastructure and talent required, there is no one even close to the level of market dominance that Amazon already has and no one with enough money to even put up meaningful resistance.$911 billion for a company with $186 billion in assets, and $19 billion in cash, which means you’re really paying about $700 billion for the undisputed king of e commerce.Think ahead into the future, do you think online shopping will become bigger or smaller? Cloud/web services? I doubt brick and mortar retail will stage a meaningful comeback any time soon. Amazons total addressable market is expanding every year AND their share of that market is still expanding.They’re in so many different businesses already, streaming media, e-commerce, advertising, groceries, cloud computing, the list goes on and in, soon to be gaming, hardware, software, services, delivery/logistics etc..This is a company that is competing with, and winning against, companies like Netflix, Disney, Microsoft, Shopify, google, Facebook, Apple, Nvidia, Walmart… They’re slowly taking over the world one sector at a time and you have 1 shot to get in at these prices.Options will give you crumbs, you should seriously consider shares and get the whole cake.I wouldn’t be surprised if after this recession amazon goes on a decade long bull rally and ends up somewhere near $5 or $6 trillion. 30 years from now they could be paying quarterly dividends HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PRICE OER SHARE. Don’t mean to write a whole novel but companies like Apple and Amazon are in a whole league of their own, with the advantage going to Amazon in my opinion. It’s a company that’s designed to take over nearly every sector in the worldwide economy, while apple is limited to hardware, software, and services.They will introduce all sorts of whacky shit that no one is even thinking of right now. Imagine putting Fedex and UPS out of business because they get so good at automated drone delivery that sending an item through the mail costs 10x as much.Imagine a 90% reduction in google shopping searches because it’s easier, cheaper, and better to just buy everything from Amazon instead of shopping at individual websites. Imagine instead of companies building websites to sell products, they list it on Amazon instead. Imagine amazon acquiring Netflix and Disney and integrating all streaming media into one amazon prime membership instead of people having accounts with 5 different services. Imagine shopify going out of business because it doesn’t make sense to have a e-commerce website any more. Imagine every 99% of the western world having an Amazon prime membership because they have expanded and dominated all the other countries out there. Imagine no one hosting their own servers, and businesses not having any computer hardware anymore because it’s better do just cloud compute with AWS.20 years ago the bulls were saying imagine shopping malls closing down because e-commerce is better, it’s already happening and the rate is increasing.Just crazy to think of what this company is going to be doing in 39 years, all the different lies they will have their finger in, the truckloads of money they will make for their shareholders.Shares dude. Don’t settle for a few thousand bucks today  when you can have hundreds of thousands or even millions down the road simply by exercising a little patience and taking ownership in something.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 07:29:01'] If you want to take a flyer, use some throwaway money and buy some long-dated calls.  Maybe you'll get lucky.    However, the best thing that you could do would be to forget about options and spend 6 months learning as much as you can about options.  You need to understand the ins and outs of each strategy as well as how to manage them in up and down scenarios.  Then, you might have a shot at surviving the game.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 18:50:17'] I am bullish on AMZN.  I currently have one short put contract on $86 strike with expiration of 16DEC22.  It's a wheel strategy; I want to own AMZN at these levels for a long term hold.I have also hedged this position with a long put spread on $87/$88 strikes on the same expiration.  All of these positions result in net credit of $0.22.  It would have been greater but I didn't apply the hedge until 2 days later.I arrived at this position due to the oversold signals from RSI.  I would eventually do the reverse of these options once they show overbought signals in a few weeks or months.  If it takes longer, then I am comfortable holding AMZN in my portfolio.  It's a profitable company and it's name is just about as ubiquitous as "Gillette" is to the razor market.I hope this helps you come to a decision on the trade.  Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 04:40:06'] I’m still heavily bearish on this market and because of that I’m bearish on Amazon.  The Fed is in Layla land if it thinks it can engineer a soft landing while beating the inflationary monster.  Not gonna happen.  Which means less people buying, less revenues and yes, lower stock prices.  Amazon is going down, way down.  They won’t see growth again for another five years when this is said and done.

I see them as a longer term (1-2 year) buy and hold, but I also kind of suck with money, so there's that to consider.As said elsewhere,  they are pricey for a beginner.  There are better choices for you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 01:13:01'] I mean, yeah, probably at some point Amazon it’s going to stop talking and climb back up, but in the past year, from down 10% to 20% to now 40 something %, it kept looking like the it’s reached its low but it kept going down. Sure, at some point it’ll go up, but what if it tanked more then recovered slowly over a year?  You’d have your capital tied up and then with time decay, you probably wouldn’t make a killing in that case. You have to decide upside vs. lost potential. What can you make with that money otherwise? If you planned on buying something and holding a year, then you could go in smaller and see, but I don’t think you’d make a killing unless the market reversed and took off. Not saying you’re wrong; just saying that people have waited for a reversal for two years and lost a lot of money, and they market is still squeezing out brick after brick.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 08:41:03'] The market is cooling off and a recession is likely.  AMZN had amazing numbers while the economy was hot, so these will make tough comps to beat for at least several quarters . . .The stock is down considerably, so some of the above may already be priced in, and since you are bullish, it might make sense to sell puts if you are good with holding the shares if assigned.  Selling 42 dte around the .30 delta could bring in about $2.50 at the 83 strike and a net stock cost of $80.50 if assigned.  The Trefis estimate still shows a $160+ valuation, so this still seems cheap in the big picture.  These puts could be rolled to lower that NSC even more before being assigned and might avoid assignment altogether.  If assigned then selling covered calls at or above the NSC can keep bringing in premiums and lowering the stock cost more and more.  This is called the wheel strategy and is popular when you have a stock you don't mind owning.  IMO long calls are more of a gamble as you will not make anything if the stock stays sideways or doesn't move up enough as IV dropping and theta decay eat away the value . . .
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 10:11:43'] Put credit spread or a Call debit spread are good for beginning.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 20:27:16'] Amazon stock analysts develop future earnings forecasts and ascribe them probabilities.  Then they intentionally understate these probabilities to be conservative and build in a risk premium.  Then the stock price, and all derivatives, are priced to be “risk neutral” - meaning on average you expect to make more money being long Delta and lose money being short Delta.This, by the way, is true for every positive Beta asset, not just AMZN.

I understand that if the price sky rockets I could miss out on those profits which is why I only plan on selling 1 covered call for each. If the price falls thats ok I still own the premium.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 17:20:29'] Good Plan. You seem like you know your risks. If you really like your shares go for .08 Delta 1-month out when Daily RSI is above 65
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 17:19:55'] This is exactly what I do over and over and over again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 20:38:00'] Think about it this way: Owning stock long term in growth companies gives you most of your return through the increase in the stock price. Those increases happen in ways and at times that you can't predict. They usually happen quite quickly. Lets say you bought FB in the past month at 188: [https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png](https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png)You figured it's basically a value stock at this point. You know many folks think it'll go up, but you don't think it will for some time. You sell covered calls at a strike of 200 and earn the premium. It pops up to 229 as it has in the past few weeks. Your shares are called away and you miss out on a 29 per share increase in the stock price. You made a small premium, but missed out on a big jump. That jump could have happened after your covered call expiry, in which case you'd win. But it didn't. If you're selling covered calls on growth stocks, you're going to make more premium but you're going to miss out on bigger growth opportunities. If you sell covered calls on value stocks that tend to trade within a tight band, you won't make much premium because the implied volatility is so low - so even though the likelihood of the stock increasing is much lower, so is the amount you earn from selling a covered call option. Selling covered calls also adds complexity and costs. So if I was you, I'd consider buying and holding long term and actually benefit from the growth in stock, instead of selling away that growth for a small premium. That way you keep the growth opportunity for yourself, without any costs other than the original transaction fee for the stock purchase. There's another factor that your options premiums are taxed as short term capital gains - in other words, ordinary income. If you hold a stock for longer than a year, not only do you benefit from the growth, but your gains are taxed as long term capital gains. The problem is that this approach requires patience, a willingness to defer gratification, which is difficult for most people, and does not involve much trading activity, which is also a problem for folks who want to think of themselves as "traders". YMMV. This is not tax advice or investment advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 19:36:29'] Alternatively, you could sell 3 contracts for GOOG and NVDA and 4 for AMZN at closer to 10% OTM. If the options get close to being ITM, sell calls on the other shares and buy to close the earlier contracts (roll up and out).
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 18:32:26'] First off, this is awesome - these are the exact posts I think truly help benefit the sub. People thinking through approaches well in advance and optimizing. Good on you. Onto your Q:>My plan is to sell 1 covered call for each of these 15-20% OTM at probably 1 month out (avoiding months with earnings months). Shoot holes in my plan.I think this is a great start to a plan but requires quite a bit more detail. It looks like some of it is implicit for you in your second paragraph but I'll mention some of the things I'm thinking about anyways in case you hadn't considered them:  \-Will you sell below your basis? If so, how would you deploy (how far below your basis, DTE, return requirements, etc)?  \-If not, is the plan to simply hold the stock? What's the downside risk management plan? Even if you intend to hold these forever, things change so it's still good practice to think through how you'd unwind in the worst case scenario.   \-NVDA pays a small dividend, does this factor into the plan at all?   \-Are you looking for any specific balance between these three? Rebalancing plans? A few initial thoughts for discussion, hope one or two of these may be useful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 21:10:23'] Problem is, when they run, they run.  I have/had four stocks I wish I never wrote calls on.  The run ups far outweigh what any premiums were collected.   The first was MSFT which was stuck in the twenties years ago.  I had about 500 shares off and on, wrote calls, sold puts, collected divvies, all good until Balmer was booted and replaced.  Then the stock went on a tear and I couldn’t keep up trying to roll the calls. Soon it was in the forties, then fifties, etc. Now $300 a share.   I bought 2000 shares of MOS about 3\~4 years ago after the sell off,  selling puts and calls when it was bouncing around back in the low twenties and mid teens.  I thought it was a really good trading stock for options.  The income was good.  Did ok.  Then it started to move.  Almost hit $70 recently.  I still have the calls in the low 30’s but missed out on about $80k of profit.  Had 1500 of OXY in the low teens and got called away in the low $30’s.   I have a $310 June call on COST.  It moved too fast to roll up.  Still hasn’t been called away, now collecting puny divs.  That’s almost $28k in lost profit.  Very annoying to say the least.  AMZN and Google I would accumulate.  Write puts instead.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 19:12:27'] Personally I would collect premium right now since it is so high, could prob collect 7-8k between all three for 5/20 .30 delta or less
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-29 21:00:39'] OK here it goes.  I would assume you are around you phone or computer full time to be trading options.April 29 Contract date (GOOG $3,100 strike = 21.00) (AMZN $3,700 strike = 30.00) (NVDA $315 strike = 5.76)GOOG - selling 7 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $700 per month. AMZN - selling 8 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $1,200 per monthNVDA - selling 6 cc's will bring in $3,420 per monthSelling 1 GOOG or AMZN cc will be a giant waste of time.  Take some more time and learn and practice selling covered calls so you feel comfortable selling all 7 or 8 contracts.   You will need some liquidity, but here is my opinion.Sell the April 29 contracts with strike as noted above.  Wait a little while after the split, because chances are, the stock will initially rip up before it settles into a normal pattern.  If the stock goes up, roll over your calls to a later date. If stock trades sideways, the time element is on your side. If stock drops, you can but back your contract for a bargain and repeat. (or just let die worthless and do again)  As long as you have liquidity, you can continue to roll over. NVDA is a different animal. Due to it's volatility, this stock will bring in premium.  Again, as long as you have liquidity, you can sell cc's and roll over those calls should the stock price rise substantially.  If trades sideways, you buy back cheap and repeat, or hold until contract is worthless.   I honestly don't worry about being assigned.  If the contract goes in the money, there's no guarantee you will be assigned.  I neve have been. I recently have a June 17th $150 call trading at $185 and I just bought back the contract for $5,500, pushed back the strike date a month and sold another for $5,500 increasing the strike price to $180.If, for some reason you get assigned, just buy back the stock. If you let it get to a spot where it's well over your strike price, shame on you. The downside is, you are a long term holder of stock. So pick companies you believe in for the long run.As for BABA situation, hopefully people were selling calls on the way down. When it rips up 30%, you roll over.  Remember, each time you sell a contract, you put premium in your account.  And each time a contract expires, that premium is yours. You don't always have to be ITM, as long as you have the liquidity to roll over. Roll over on the way up, take premium on the way down

Ill exaggerate - but is this short some of the most innovative and long term high growth stocks that have ever existed?It’s a lot of work to mitigate issues for dinky premiums.  Take notes and choose wisely so you can wash rinse repeat long term and limit damage control.  Keep track. Spread sheet, etc so you can learn and see if it’s working. You can paper trade them now to see what happens. Come up with a plan. Significant move up - are you committed to allowing assignment? Stock drops - are you going to later sell covered calls below your CB? And let them assign?Rolling…?Rolling eats up gobs of time, profit or makes you sit on zero gains for months. As premium goes up - yes longer DTEs are valuable but so is the one you have to buy back to roll out of.  They’re often equivalent so you’re just baking the initial dinky premium into a much longer time frame and higher cost for a strike that still might get surpassed. These might be dumb numbers but as an example:You sell a CC for $100 premium. Significant run up happens. Buyback is $500 and roll to a higher strike takes 6 months and a $550 premium for a $50 credit. You’ve now got $150 of CC premium but the CC is valued at $550 so you’re down $400 and hoping it doesn’t keep running.  keep track and make sure what you’re doing is working like you think it will.

That’s a lot capital. The strategy would have been terrific going back ten or twenty years. Going forward? No one knows. Please understand that the leaders during one bull market may become laggards during the next phase. That is more common than the same leaders for many decades.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:25:44'] Whatever she buys I will buy too
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 12:15:49'] The Nvidia split information was in their meeting as something to vote on. Which if I remember right was before 6/3. So if you expected the stock to go up due to the announcement then you would be buying calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:39:26'] How much of this is really her personally or just someone else managing her accounts?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:43:51'] She’s very active in this sub. Obviously just taking advantage of the amazing DD and other WSB gems.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 14:52:08'] If Congress had a etf I’d put all of money money into it
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:42:42'] Maybe you can claim knowledge of splits but the AMZN/AAPL seemed pretty normal and would be pretty difficult for anyone to insider trade given that there was no news that drove them higher
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 12:51:37'] I wish there was a ticker that tracks senators' portfolios. I'd buy calls on that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 12:54:01'] lol, a thread full of people thinking that buying ITM $AMZN + $AAPL leaps is some great insider info play.  Doesn't take a genius or insider info to be buying leaps on 2 of the biggest company in the world that had been trading sideway for a year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:39:35'] I’m a registered independent, so I have no political allegiance. I do have a question: is there something about her position that would allow her to know that $AMZN will jump? I can see that it’s possible for someone at $NVDA telling her that it will split to gain political favors, but how would she know if a tech stock is going to jump? Genuinely curious.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:33:35'] Insider trading must be so nice
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:44:02'] Nancy doesn't trade...but, her husband is a fucking gambler
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 20:14:35'] I need to see this paired with all her other trades. It's easy to cherry pick winners
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:51:04'] Buying deep ITM leaps doesn't seem much like insider trading to me
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:17:54'] Dang, for June/2022!? All those were already ITM, musta paid a pretty penny for those contracts. Nice to be a rich public servant.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:33:06'] Nancy pelosi sittin there on Robinhood while everyone arguing about politics
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 17:08:25'] Come on one she doesn't make her own stock buys a trader does. This kind of statement gets real old real fast.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 16:14:27'] I appreciate that you guys think that Nancy is managing her own stock portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 12:03:20'] As others have noted, these trades don't seem tainted to me. AAPL and AMZN have been dragging for months and were due for a bit of a break out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:15:31'] Nothing to see move along.  Find me a politician that goes into the House or Senate and does not exit a multi-millionaire.  On a under $185K salary... and a campaign that spends MILLIONS to buy that position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:38:27'] I have done the exact 3 moves, few weeks ago all the three looked good buys.  Am I Nancy Pelosi?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 15:32:52'] Why do they get so much time before reporting their trades?  That law needs to change.  They are their own dark pool - and we are paying their salaries.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 14:36:13'] Its not insider trading. NVDA split was announced 5/24
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:13:42'] Nothing crazy going on here if you actually look at the purchases, just smart buys. Put down your pitchforks and tinfoil hatsNVDA announced stock split on May 21 pre-market, [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/21/2234144/0/en/NVIDIA-Announces-Four-for-One-Stock-Split-Pending-Stockholder-Approval-at-Annual-Meeting-Set-for-June-3.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/21/2234144/0/en/NVIDIA-Announces-Four-for-One-Stock-Split-Pending-Stockholder-Approval-at-Annual-Meeting-Set-for-June-3.html)AMZN has not had any stock changing news, it's simply undervalued. The JEDI project cancellation doesn't mean much.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 11:09:22'] She also owned pre IPO rights to Visa stock in 2008, shortly before nixing a house bill to increase regulation on credit cards. She’s a quiet, careful kind of corrupt that doesn’t see the spotlight as much as the loud republicans you mostly hear about these days
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 11:46:24'] I wish people would stop acting like they don’t have financial advisors.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:56:58'] Oh man those NVDA $400 strike leaps probably printed hard.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 12:22:12'] Good investment
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 15:08:45'] Her husband also bought amc before blast off
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 18:10:07'] the reporting policy is that they have to report their transactions “within 45 days of becoming aware of any transaction” or incur $200 fine. usually it’s way too late when the report is out
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 19:48:21'] Oh Snap, It's the guy with the Delayed flow for his Alerts. Did ya finally get that fixed yet ?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 22:51:45'] Have you seen [https://senatestockwatcher.com/](https://senatestockwatcher.com/) You can literally watch the insider trading.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 04:46:22'] someone get her discord link
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 06:22:47'] It’s only insider trading if you don’t have the power
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 08:08:54'] People in these public office positions shouldn’t be allowed to buy/sell/trade stocks period. Company stock prices can and are manipulated by a lot of laws and policies these people control.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 17:57:33'] Insider trading
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-08 04:49:07'] And she distracts the masses with racial division and wokeness while filling up her piggy bank. It’s too easy for these people the masses are so willing to play dumb
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 13:22:06'] They shouldn't be allowed to invest while serving the public. It would also get rid of lifetime appointments like this.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 11:23:51'] Can you take these kinds of posts over to a political subreddit? I want to read about people’s options plays, not read people’s opinions on how a politician is trading on insider information 2 weeks after said insider information was announced to the public. NVDA split was announced 5/21 and she (aka her wealth manager) bought deep ITM leaps on 6/3.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:01:21'] NVDA before split was just smart.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 15:23:04'] I met her husband when I was briefly at Legg Mason. He's fucking brilliant and been in the finance game for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:31:36'] This ol lady is wicked
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 15:31:18'] We need to drain the swamp.  Amazing how governmental servants become rich in office.  Look at the candidates AMZN gives political donations to, while treating their workers like dogs.  As long as their contributions to the powerful government partners continues nothing will change.  We, the average men and women outnumber them - we have the power with our vote to change this.  No more allowing the rich to get richer at the cost of the working men/women who struggle to  pay their monthly bills, while politicians pretend to care.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:02:30'] Looking at the 1 year chart, it just seems like when $AMZN dips 200-400 points, people are buying calls. Doesn't look like anything nefarious.  My friend who is a degenerate gambler does the same thing, especially on a Friday if AMZN has been down all week.  Buys ATM calls +/- 2months and comes away with massive 5 figure gains. $NVDA , if she placed the trade when it was in the $500 range early May, would seem shady, but on 6/3 it was $678.  That's just a ballsy trade.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 15:07:39'] Nancy ain’t making the trades herself.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 19:20:52'] Yeah well she also bought Tesla at 800 so... just sayin.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 04:48:53'] When you have inside information! And this my people is why the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor!
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:57:41'] Will she ever get busted? This seems like it always borders insider trading
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:51:00'] She also bought RBLX before the hasbro deal and MSFT before the Jedi deal. Makes me want to puke.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:22:08'] Orange man bad! Reeeesed
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:27:18'] Yup everyone wanted to question trumps money, but why not question career long political figures on a 6 figure salary somehow all being worth 100m+ ….HOW?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:19:49'] So Martha Stewart goes to prison, but Nancy is living it up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 14:09:16'] Nanci is a god damn animal. I remember when she was buying Tesla call FD’s right before Biden announced their EV initiatives. She has great timing
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:10:24'] When you are an insider trading through US Senate information=profits 🧠
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:49:13'] Thanks for the heads up. No reason to single out NP though, lots of trades by our well informed elected officials. More R than D actually.Thanks for sharing the website for info.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 09:58:09'] It’s called insider trading. Research her and her husband and the money they made from credit card laws.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 11:43:25'] It’s weird how politicians are always getting so lucky with their bets 🤷🏻‍♂️
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 11:58:35'] She’s an insider trading lock her up
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:07:52'] Looking at her track record, she could easily be the best, highest paid fund manager of all time but Nancy is only interested in public service. I applaud her personal sacrifice to stay in politics 👏👏👏
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:25:08'] Wonder how many of the posters defending this would do so if these were Trump’s trades?Situational ethics at it’s finest!
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:46:31'] Do we really think Nancy is even smart enough to know what to trade even WITH insider info lmao? No. It's obviously her husband running her account. She probably isn't even in the loop regarding these transactions on her behalf.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:55:05'] I wish I was a great trader like her.  On a serious note her husband is the one who executes the trades.  Lets face it insider information does pay off.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 11:53:15'] This is why we need to limit terms they can serve

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:18:24'] If anyone else did what she did based on information she has at the timing of her trades we’d be charged with insider trading.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 13:42:23'] Hi Nancy,I voted for you, could you at least add me to your options alert?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 16:25:34'] Amazing and impeccable timing how does she do it? Gee I wonder since congress can insider trade now where does the money go after that? Who gets their cut?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 17:58:57'] Insider trader knowledge. Illegal. Fry her old wrinkled ass!
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 20:29:50'] Wow how is this legal and not putting her personal interests over the peoples?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 04:40:42'] Pretty easy to do when you're allowed to insider trade and come from a corrupt crime family
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 12:52:40'] It’s ok, y’all. She represents the left. It’s ok when they do it. The main stream media’s lack of coverage should’ve told you so.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-07 07:26:31'] It's called insider trading.  And the people that should be doing something about it are the same ones committing the crime.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:26:18'] Forget D/R…this is mind blowing how this isn’t a conflict of interest! Term limits for congress….? Might help eliminate decades worth of this BS
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:29:28'] Congress is allowed to use their Intel to trade their own portfolio, but it is illegal for them to share that information outside of congress. It's a weird and unfair practice, but Pelosi isn't the only senator who trades stocks and options.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-06 10:09:48'] My question is, Has her husband (i.e. her money) made a large losing move? If all big moves are winners, then objectively it's suspicious.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-10 07:22:28'] People keep voting for these corrupt assholes, then wondering why they do stuff like this.  Everyone hates Trump so much, go look at his trades while President.  He had a few shares of some random company which he didn't even know he had, made a political move and profited like $100 or something and mainstream media was all over it.  Meanwhile people like Pelosi making big moves for decades and msm says nothing.  This should tell you all where the corruption truly lies, yet people still can't catch on to what is right in front of them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-11 20:32:28'] Because Nancy Pelosi engages in insider trading. Yet Martha Stewart had to spend time in prison over nonsense.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi everyone, I've had Nvidia (108 shares) since January 4th 2016 for a cost basis of about $7,50/share (bought AMZN at the same time too, these were the first stocks I ever bought). These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo. Strategy suggestions welcome"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:14:49'] Don't be like me. I sold covered calls twice on NVDA. Once on the runup from metaverse. Lost out on doubling my gains from 30k to 60k. Second time I sold one 3 months ago and nvda rallied from my 300 purchase price to 380. I'll sell cover calls on stuff. But that's the last time I sell ccs on NVDA. Sat out on 30-40k of gains for a measly $800 I got from selling the CCs.Edit: Not double the gains. Double the amount in my account from 30 to 60k.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:32:03'] you could sell the NVDA stock to a round lot (down to 100 shares) and use that capital to do what you're looking to do. this would still give you the option of selling CCs as wellsince you're not going to play capital gains tax on the sale, there's no real downside to just selling stock here if you want to diversify more  FWIW, selling 8 shares would cover your entire cost basis for the position PLUS secured profit of around 300% if you've purchased at a $7.50 average.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:09:36'] Just sell some to reduce the size down to your desired weight. No need to get unnecessarily fancy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:56:22'] I understand wanting to diversify. Can't blame you with Nvidia's current price either but If you have a longer term view I wouldn't completely liquidate. However, with Amazon I would much rather reduce it to a very small position due to the consistent negative quarters.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:39:51'] If you want to diversify, just sell most of it. It's a tax free account so there are no capital gains taxes to worry about. I wouldn't bother with CCs in your situation. There is a very real chance that NVDA corrects. How would that make you feel?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 23:04:57'] Selling $30 OTM calls every two weeks would net $480 in premium ($420 strike right now). That seems like a very agreeable price to me even in the event of a run up. You’re free to do whatever you want, including selling now. But that’s a really REALLY nice OTM to premium ratio to me.Weekly would be about $240. This next week is a day short, so premiums closed Friday at $200. Either 1 week or 2 weeks would work
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:19:55'] What about selling some NVDA to buy them? Realize some gains and reduce the chance of losing more if you sell a call and the stock tanks or it takes off and you end up not being along for the ride.You can't just add to the other 2 companies you listed without selling?You want to diversify but you'd be almost completely out of NVDA if the shares get called away.PS: I sold NVDA just before this $100 run :/ and most of what I've been selling calls on has cost me a lot of unrealized gains. Of course all of my stocks I'm not selling CCs on are doing nothing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:33:59'] $20 out might not pay much....especially a week or 2 out.   It's a decent strategy if you truly want to sell, but if there's a runup, it's painful to watch on the sidelines as your contract becomes worthless and the shares you "kind of own" are worth a thousand more than they were 3 days ago and you can't cash in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:37:33'] Don’t waste your energy on the NVDA CC.  Make your decision to hold it for the price you want or have a stop loss.  At most, I’d do June 16 call 410 if you want to squeeze that $1000 premium right now.  Don’t cloud your judgment on your best trade ever.  Hold it or sell it and don’t regret it.  Context.  I crushed with AAPL in early 2000s. Average cost in <$10 dollar range.   In 2019, sold over 1000 shares for help with down payment on vacation home.  AAPL has gone up a lot since then.  So has that property and never regretted decision.  Currently have 1800 shares from remaining 2000 I had.  My goal was to sell off 500 and diversify.  I’ve done that with 200.  The other 300 are in CC that shot past my CC on this last run from $130 up to 170s.  I don’t think about any of the other moves, but these CC for squeezing that last bit of gain before diversifying has tied me up while I’d rather make other buys with that money on my time frame and clear mind.  Wasn’t worth it.  Maybe for you it’s worth it but not me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:08:05'] It's a good strategy if the market keeps on moving up slowly. Drastic moves can cause trouble, especially if you hold too many contracts for your account size.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 12:43:21'] Yeah I've been trading this for many years. Go small (i.e. less contracts) when the VIX is low, like now. Ladder in bigger positions when it spikes. You could also go closer to the money when the VIX spikes. Buy a way OTM put (1-2 delta) for protection. When IV is low, I'd take profits earlier (30-40%).Use the ES unless you have portfolio margin. Otherwise the buying power utilization is very inefficient.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 14:45:16'] When IV is too low to sell puts, it is definitely too low to sell strangles. Neutral strategies profit from IV contraction and time decay versus movement. IVR is at its 52 week low.SPX/ES aren’t more safe than those ETFs and equities that you mentioned. /ES is ~215,000 dollar notional product, SPX is ~430,000 dollar notional product.SPX is at a negative IVR. These are the red flags with your trades
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 08:47:25'] I've had similar struggles managing options against stocks due to volatility and assignment risk.  My primary strategy is a 12-Delta SPX Strangle, opened 45 DTE, roll out at 21 DTE, exit at 50% profit, and roll untested when tested is greater than 15-Delta.  It sucks up a lot of buying power, but I've also been mechanically managing this strategy for years.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 15:51:29'] I love the theta Strat's such as selling puts.  That's pretty much all I do and to be honest, the returns are pretty good!  As long as you choose solid names so that if you get exercised you're protected, you'll be good.  I also use a hybrid where I sometimes sell put credit spreads (very solid names).  Reading your comment and based on the deltas of your straddle, you are assuming more upside for the market which is my bias as well.  Selling puts or theta strategies however don't allow that upside gain as our returns are more or less fixed.  The strangle is an interesting idea.  Personally, I am considering a call roll strategy where I go 30 days out and get at the monies.  This will give me the upside I need to keep up with the market while the puts will continue to print.  That being said, I should probably investigate methods to hedge my downside just in case.What do you guys think though, strangle to pad the stats or call roll?  I'm curious.Also, I am using a bigger portfolio

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 02:19:51'] I'm not sure I understand your edge here. What is it that you think the market is not pricing in?Correct me if I'm wrong but you will have 5 shares of GOOGL, which will become 100, so you want to sell 1 call which you think will be covered after the 20:1 split? That's not correct.If you're short 1 call of GOOGL $4000 strike pre-split, those will automatically become short 20 contracts for 100 shares each at $200 strike post-split. (EDIT: it might be 1 contract for 2,000 shares at $200 strike). Do you want to be short calls for 2,000 shares on a ~$133 stock?If I missed something let me know, I know you said you would close pre-split. I'm just not sure why you're using the split as a timing factor here. If you have 5 shares of GOOGL and sell that $4000 call, you'll probably be close to delta-neutral, and short vega. Is that what you want? You should re-delta-hedge if the stock rises because you'll be screwed if it shoots up for some reason. This is the whole pennies/steamroller analogy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 05:01:04'] I don't think you'll be able to sell a call prior to the split, unless you just sell it naked. At the moment you don't have 100 shares, so you do not have collateral right now. Also outstanding options contracts are going to be adjusted once the split happens.Ya should probably just wait till the split and then sell CCs as you see fit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-10 00:43:38'] Amazon and Google have been trading sideways for better than a year, Notice of a stock split made them jump a little, but both dropped back down,  I think you’ll be pretty safe , if your concerned maybe sell a OTM call and buy it back before the actual shareholder vote, then if it does skyrocket before the split date sell a new one, that way you make the money of theta decay between now and then

You gotta try and think like the market makers and get in a few days before earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 16:47:44'] Yes, they split your options when the stock splits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 17:23:15'] You won’t have to pay but if you sell those contracts after the split then you will
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 18:22:26'] Are you asking if you have to pay a commission/premium/fee due to now having additional contracts? If so, the answer is generally no, the adjustment is to make you as a contract holder “whole.” It’s not a buy or sell initiated by you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 10:46:44'] No charge on the split, but you will have to pay to close the new 20 contracts.Also if you have a twenty dollar wide spread it will go to 1 dollar wide spreads. Close spreads before the split, and let things settle to the new prices.Also the boys talked about it today.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKXfTXp_EuQ
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 19:56:50'] Not a good idea, they will become non-standard options and lose liquidity
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 19:33:39'] It depends on the broker but the split should not incur a transaction fee.  When you sell, you will incur the fee for the transaction and for each contract (assuming your broker charges transaction fees).  So if you sell the contracts, you will 20x the per contract fee (if its 0 - then 20x0)
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-23 17:56:44'] You could find your answer on YouTube
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 06:57:11'] A whole number stock split ratio will result in a proportional increase in the number of options and a proportional decrease in the option strike price.     Whole splits have a "1" in the second part of the ratio, such as 2 for 1, 3 for 1 or 5 for 1. For example, if you own a $2,000 call on a stock that declares a 20-for-1 stock split, after the split you would own 20 call options with a $100 strike price (1 x 2000 = 20 x 100).    There are no fees charged for stock splits and the resultant option adjustments.

POST_TEXT: b"#9/01 Update: Now that these are up over 100% from the time of posting, it's time to start taking some profit. I would sell at least your cost basis, potentially more. Leave one or two for any additional run up/gap fill. To all those who took this play, particularly the ones who reached out to me after the fact, ily <3\n\n----\n\nLets not make this complicated. \n\n1. $AMZN has been consolidating since its past earnings disappointment and has found solid support at the $3200 level. At $3300, its the time to at least initiate a position if you dont have one already.\n\n2. $AMZN currently sits at an IV rank of 1%. That means over the past year the IV has been higher 99% of the time. What makes IV swell? Earnings. What happens when IV swells? The price of the underlying option goes up. \n\n3. The S&P 500 is up 19.26% YTD, 30.66% over the past 365 days. $AMZN is essentially flat in both regards and is the worst-performing FAANG name on a yearly basis. Comparatively, FAANG names like $GOOG and $MS"
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 09:01:09'] This is incredibly well said. I have come to similar conclusions about AMZN and it is my highest conviction play at the moment. I have 3550/3750 spreads open for September 2022. They cost about ~6,500 each and they payout ~13,000 if AMZN is over 3750 in a year. I went with a year because then it will be a long term hold and not a short term one. It's still speculative because if the whole market has huge issues between now and then they will become nearly worthless, but considering AMZN reached that price just a couple months ago gives me an extreme amount of confidence in this.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-25 14:21:10'] I think you did thorough research and I agree with most of what you're saying here. My only hesitation and point that I would bring up is the both QQQ and SPY are both trading at all time highs, and we haven't seen a real 5-10% pullback/correction since April. With the market trading super hot right now, delta looming and inflation data not looking good in the short term, I think we are more than due for at least a 5% pullback across many sectors, if not more so in big tech.Another interesting point of bullishness I can see for Amazon in terms of TA is looking at the One year chart with weekly candles and the 50 day Simple Moving Average. In the past year or so time frame, each time AMZN has dropped down to its 50SMA, it tends to bounce off it as support. As of today it seems to be using the 50SMA as support again and a green candle is forming. I would be inclined to agree with you that it is at a strong support level and your position seems well suited for strong gains

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 13:57:17'] I give a disclaimer every time someone wants to go short strangle.  If your going to go sell a put, you should always have enough money in your account to withstand the opposite move. If your going to go sell a call, you should always have a stock ready to deliver at time of expiration.This is achieved by using a buy limit , where you are buying the shares of stock when the stock price exceeds your short calls. Remember your obligations.  This is option risk management 101.Edit works on stocks,etf, not cash settled instruments(euro style),which can be harder to manage.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:13:08'] Short strangle on volatile tech stocks is asking for trouble. They can easily move 5-10% a day with or without earnings or news, and your account could be wiped out if you don't manage your risk vigorously.Ideally you want to find something with low delta and gamma, higher theta, with moderate to long due and relatively small IV. I would pick QQQ after all the major tech earning are done, or SPY most of the time but try to avoid trading on FOMC or interest announcement days.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 23:52:42'] I'm selling calls on Amazon right now and I think the returns are okay. But I've also not been doing this very long. One correction I've made to my approach is to make sure I sell the call when the stock appears to be going up in value. I didn't understand that when I first started and wound up buying back my call for a loss, twice. Another stock that I'm having luck with is UNH, though it is very expensive and outside the price range you indicated in your post. I think the basic conundrum with The Wheel is that stocks with high premiums are basically more risky. TSLA is probably the best example of this. The premiums are great, but just know that it could take a dive at any time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 06:02:32'] There’s always a trade off between premiums and safety. High premiums usually implies high IV which usually implies more volatile stocks. The exception is around earnings. I like to sell around earnings on good stocks (as opposed to others) to capture the high IV but realize many times this is a bet. However when done correctly this ca net you a tidy profit. With the wheel though I always cover myself even with the cash secured put I will buy a put to protect downside. This strategy while lowering your income a bit allows me to sleep better at night. Use Barchart to screen for stocks around earnings and to meet your criteria. You have to pay for a subscription though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 00:45:57'] Searching for stocks, consider factors like the stock's volatility, liquidity, and stability. Higher implied volatility typically results in higher option premiums, but it also comes with greater risk. Look for stocks with a good balance of these factors to maximize your potential returns while managing risk.You can look into Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). These stocks tend to have reasonably high liquidity and can offer decent premiums, though you should assess each stock's suitability for your strategy and risk tolerance.To discover more stocks suitable for this strategy, check out articles on the [best stock picking service](https://joywallet.com/article/best-stock-picking-services/).

Some will drop while others may not.Look at the 11 sectors to research the top or best stocks in each as you build your list.  I don't pay attention to what premiums the stocks pay while vetting them, but will look when it is time to trade them.  The premiums will vary so these will go up and down over time and it is more important to trade stocks that are less likely to drop and often move back up faster if they do.

Minimum Div of 2% yield, and at least $2.00 annual payout, quarterly4. IV between 25 - 755. Price between $x to $y based on your account size and risk tolerance6. Then, trending above its 200 EMA, and good bid/ask pricing. Check the bid/ask prices in the front week and 42DTE week to see strike selection and tight pricing7. Liquidity is my most important criteria, thus the need for weeklies. The div also culls out the "growth" stocks that have not made money. I look at the candidates in the Analyze tab to check their financials for free cash flow and positive financial trends.Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 06:24:27'] in the future, realize that buying options for when volatility is high due to an imminent event, and likely to immediately go lower (i.e. buying right before and holding to after an earnings report for example) will adversely affect premium. look up IV crush and keep that in mind in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 09:50:51'] Gotta disagree with everyone in here, if you had already lost 90% due to IV crush, then you’re essentially left with a lotto ticket that you might as well hang on to. Might expire worthless, but since you have 30 days left, there might be an event that sends IV back up, or if the price creeps back at all from mean reversion you could recover some. It’s already recovered 2% from the morning low.However, definitely never buy a short dated call around earnings again. Options sellers (like me) love when people do that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 05:56:42'] You may want to cut losses since most of that pricing was IV.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 10:18:07'] When you buy before earnings, a lot of the time option prices are higher due to increased IV because people are unaware how earnings will play out. Once earnings pass, people's certainty about the stock's future rises and so IV drops, reducing option prices. Not only has IV dropped after earnings for AMZN, but they also fell short on Q3 guidance.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 20:51:29'] You could have created a bearish short call spread by selling weekly $3500 and even lower calls against the $3585 you own. It creates weird risk in violent up move but I doubt it recovers over $3500 in that time frame.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 21:41:55'] Taking a few hits is the best teacher.  I never buy or sell options leading up to earnings just because of the uncertainty and it’s really a crapshoot how things will turn out, and have always done well right after earnings.   I made a stupid mistake a few weeks ago and put in an order to “sell” a handful of puts on a thinly trade stock.  I have done it in the past and every now and then it hits.  But this past time I set it up to sell 8 contracts with a sp of $30 @ $3 (the stock trades in the 40’s and the last two times I got $2 for a month out) and it executed in a split second at 91cents.   WTF, I put the order in for $3.  Looking closer I just bought 8 $30 put contracts a month out.   No more decaf and I am now just holding waiting for it to…I don’t know, collapse to $25 lol ??  I tried to sell it and went down to 30 cents and nothing, the b/a must be super wide, like 5cents / 90cents.  If it is worth less than 10cents,  my reasoning is might as well hold on to it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 04:12:34'] There was (is) another way to play AMZN options. Wait for the earnings to come out then IF the price imploded (as it did) buy the call(s).

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 17:27:49'] AMZN is a pig. Its a gobbler stock. It eats up downstream value and everything priced in is gobbled up without a cogent return on revenues realized. It's maxed out until full diversification of product/service lines. I'd recommend a AWS, KDP, Prime Video and Studio, Amazon sales, and a fifth company which does nothing but interfaces all back to itself/mothership. The first mega tech to break apart like this will set the stage for others. It will happen and the first to do it immediately becomes the darling of congress and every entity out there with anti-trust action in play. The lawyers will not like it but gosh, that's just too bad.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 01:01:15'] Wow i thought i was alone. Just on monday i had a huge mess up on a trade because of incorrect data being shown to me. A trade i was trying to place for 13k was instead placed for 450,000 dollars in options. My buying power was apparently being based on two day old quotes and quotes I were seeing were from two days ago. My balance went to -130,000 immediately. I called td right away on the verge of complete manic mode. They then force liquidated my position and said i then owed them the 130k and only thing to do now now would be to talk to collections on figuring out a payment plan. The next two days were the most stressful days of my life and I probably called and talked to about 20 different lawyers about what to do. Very luckily yesterday TD risk manager called me from his personal cell and said after talking with senior management they were doing a courtesy to me and removing the debt and restoring my original balance. He reiterated i had no legal basis to pursue them though. This is insane and the emotional stress on me alone probably do some permanent damage to me. This is not right.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-28 22:54:40'] So if Ameritrade stinks who to use? Fidelity? E*Trade? Think or swim is both a blessing and a curse, especially on mobile, so I’ve been looking into other options.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 06:55:32'] To be fair, Thursday and Friday set volume records over multiple exchanges. There was widespread latency and the many exchanges declared self help.

One of the unintended consequences of free trading.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 01:33:06'] I'm looking at the images you posted, and I'm a little bit confused.The time for the SPY pic looks like it was taken at 10:30am for the mobile pic but 11:12am for the desktop pic. If true, that would explain why the SPY quotes are off.The AMZN quote for desktop is from 10:30am but your mobile pic doesn't show what time the mobile app pic was taken. I myself have experienced sizable delays between the time I hit the "confirm and send" button and receiving confirmation notices that my orders had been fulfilled, sometimes up to 10 seconds or so. Usually, it's during power hour. I also got an interesting notice on my desktop ToS today. After leaving it open for a long time, it showed me an error message and said something along the lines of ToS ran out of RAM. Increase from 512 to 1024 and restart? I hit yes, and it restarted. Not sure if ToS needs to be restarted a lot in order to get rid of laggy performance and delayed quotes. And, yes, I also turned on realtime quotes.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 04:21:20'] ToS has a 15 minute delay for paper trading. For real time data you have to opt in and it displays it for you

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 08:29:20'] This is robinhood levels of fuckery
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 04:52:48'] It has been the heaviest volume week in recent memory so having data relaying issues is not really out of the norm. But to my main point, there is absolutely no way for any broker, let alone a broker as big as TD, to profit from quoting "incorrect data". A person is free to go long or short so obviously there wouldn't be any edge in them doing that. I am assuming it is just something with the data that goes to the charts being slower than the level 2 data. And if that is a problem for you maybe consider leaving TD.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-28 22:28:48'] I believe the default is 15 (10?) minute delayed data.IIRC, you have to agree that you're a retail trader and that you're not going to repurpose/resell the data to another party/firm. Some terms and conditions to that extent. There's also some lag, on any APP vs any connected computer. Not 15 minutes though.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-28 23:31:41'] Hmm good to know. I will buy on the mobile and short on the desktop
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 01:36:31'] Noticed this as well when I had ToS opened on my desktop vs the mobile ToS app. In my situation the price being displayed on the desktop was lagging behind the mobile app by at least 2-3 seconds I’ll see how it is on Monday
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 02:12:21'] My bank robbed me yesterday too. I was about to sell my Tesla short options when they were at their highest value. (the options - not Tesla)But suddenly the option decides to “refresh” to update it’s price. This took 3 minutes. I opened up MarketWatch to check the underlying asset (Tesla) and of course Tesla had gone up in price. Which meant that i lost all my money just because their refresh took 3 minutes instead of 5 seconds. I lost around $2.000 which isn’t a crisis for me but definitely not fun.I have seen this shit before too. I also have a couple of screenshots which i could upload if anyone would be interested.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 06:04:34'] I thought I was the only one who got robbed by TD, yesterday Think or swim showed that I had not sold 3 2900 SPX PUT contracts, they showed a P/L of over 16000 dollars so of course I sold them at open. And then played some more options trades through the day. Cut to about 1pm and literally all my money is gone and I’m being margin called. I hop onto a support chat and they tell me I was using money that wasn’t mine due to a clerical error on think or swim and that now I have to pay up over 300 dollars, how the fuck arm I at fault for a clerical error on the think or swim platform??? Any advice other than longing $ROPE would be appreciated.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 11:35:59'] You check the most amount of platforms they have and go by that quote. But, you should also call your brokerage firm immediately when you encounter ANY error. Shit goes wrong all the time, but if their customer service is worth their salt, they will be very helpful and realistic with you.These firms get their quotes from different vendors for different products. Fucking morons think with the amount of regulations these firms are under that they are skimming their clients. If shit goes wrong and you place a trade based upon it, with photo evidence and they don't make it right, then you're with the wrong company. Time stamps for everything. Previewed orders, private messages sent with specific intentions. Document everything went something feels off and every way possible with what you are trying to do while you are calling them. The only thing they could be doing is routing your orders to specific market centers in higher volumes than their execution quality would dictate they should get while receiving kickbacks from that specific market maker. All you have to do is call your firm and ask how they choose where their order flow goes. Hell, you can even ask to only be routed to certain ones or only one. Market orders can fuck you, but that is your fault for placing a market order without understanding what that means and how market makers operate. Use a limit, be patient and put it on the opposite side and always let the market come to you.
	COMMENT: ['2020-03-01 07:23:48'] Some thoughts and corrections....and I don't mean to be insensitive, just realistic...First, factually, Schwab and TDA have not merged. Schwab has nothing to do with TDA operationally at all right now. Any issues with TDA are their own. What's going on? Record volumes which affect the exchanges processing trades, and record new account holders at some brokerages which affects their systems' processing abilities with their clients. Layered on top of record volume and accounts are the inherent limitations of existing brokerage platforms. They are legacy systems with new software grafted on. Like any similar situation - think medical, DMV, etc - they are inherently less stable.Even without the above limitations any system - mechanical, computational, hell even social - when pushed to its tolerances faces an exponentially higher probability of failure. The best engineered Ferrari when driven hard at redline for two hours is at higher risk of failure.So therefore.....Guys, this is what a market break looks like. And we haven't even had a circuit breaker down day yet. And - short history lesson - this occurrence is neither the first nor worst. During the 1987 crash the floor shut down...not client facing brokerages, but the actual exchange floor. Ditto the Fedwire system. Money could not even be transferred through the banking (vs. brokerage) system during the day. Forget accurate, timely quotes...investors (retail and institutional) couldn't even track their cash in banks.What does it all mean? A brokerage platform failure under last week's conditions is neither your fault nor the responsibility of the brokerage.Those statements are not incongruous...both conditions can logically exist in the same time and space. That is the disclosure under Paragraph 3. That disclosure, btw, is not unique to brokerages. Such concept, and the ensuing clause, is present in most contracts.The situation last week was analogous to a western NY record lake effect snowstorm. You have the reasonable expectation that your town's roads are maintained. It's snowing, two feet so far, and winds are 45 mph with whiteout conditions. You hop into your SUV, spin out on some ice, and end up in a ditch. Not your fault, but not the responsibility of the DMV either...If we have a crazy upcoming week in the market please don't be the dude that plants his family in the snowbank. Know the limitations imposed on you by the environment and your equipment. Or, drive out in the middle of the storm and wait for the tow and ambulance, and be indignant that the roads weren't cleared.  Just remember, injured and indignant is not where you want to be with your family or your capital.GL to all this week.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 05:34:31'] Does anybody have a link to the terms of service?  I looked but can't seem to find it anywhere.That aside, it isn't clear what the issue is here.   TOS does have stupid stuff going on from time to time.  Yesterday everything was a mess early on and I have seen it just stop updating here and there too.  This also seems to be regional.   They say up front in one of their disclosures that volume and system issues can cause delays.I've been using TOS for a lot of years.  I've subscribed to real time/L2 quotes and generally works fine.  If I put in an order (typically autosend) and it goes against me, that's on me for agreeing to pay a certain amount on a trade and the instrument goes opposite of what I thought.  The deskop app can be set from 0 delay to 15 seconds (with options for 1, 2, 10 and 15 seconds.  Why anybody would delay is a mystery to me)Is the suggestion that even real-time quotes are delayed?   And what's the definition of "delayed"?  I can certainly see how my desktop might be a few seconds behind the actual market-- it's called latency folks.   Some/many of those platforms are in a data center in NJ.  I'm in Arizona.  There's a reason why institutions co-locate their servers in NJ.  It would be silly to expect that you're not going to get latency between the NJ data center, TD facilities and your desktop.   Hell, my wife could be on one PC execute an order and I get the confirmation ding right away or 2-3 seconds later on my PC.EDIT:  OP also appears to be looking at the "charts" tab.  I'd never use that for anything other than TA over a period of time beyond a day.  For any intraday stuff I always use the active trader charts - tick and minute charts.  And changing values on either of those can do some goofy stuff to the candles, especially changing tick values (clearly b/c it's recalculating the chart).
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 06:15:39'] Their systems aren’t set up to scale when lots of users are on the platform at the same time and everything from quotes to trading gets messed up to a point where they stall out. Then you get screwed and some even liquidated because you end up negative. They don’t care and you can’t fight them because you signed disclosures that said that they have the right to screw up even if it costs you money. This has happened on prior big market drops too.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 06:26:48'] I'm not corroborating anything OP said, but I use TOS and IB and they both looked like they "flipped the switch" for this weeks volatility.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 06:45:39'] I noticed the stock price on the chart differed from tos watchlist. I was daytrading Tesla so this became important. I actually made a phone call to TDA but then it seem to correct itself so I hung up. I also saw from a different app the underlying was in line with the graphs but not the watchlist.  I haven’t noticed too many TD Ameritrade glitches compared to my other platform on Fidelity. Last week I lost more than $1000 because of the Fidelity servers being down. All brokerages have small print that says they’re not responsible for the servers being down.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 07:49:35'] Incorrect data? Didn’t you say the quotes were from from Friday? Did we not have a massive gap down? Did you think quotes would stay the same? You’re just part of a generation that blames everyone else for your problems. It was correct data and anyone with half a brain cell would have known those were prices from the priory trading day. Like I said, you’ll lose it all eventually anyway. Or you’ll be smart and withdraw it after you yolo half of it away.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 09:33:00'] I experienced severe lag this week, but it was the worst it's ever been yesterday. That being said trying to place any trades, or even seeing any fkn \[option\] contact volume, on RH was a nightmare as well. CNBC did mention that this week had record trade volume and it's pretty easy to see how the brokerage networks/servers could be overwhelmed.   Ex: my buddy uses Fidelity and he was completely locked out of his account on wed or Thursdays. Couldn't log in to close out his MSFT calls. We joked that Fidelity owed him the difference between the max profit he knew he had, had he been able to close out the position, and the money he lost when he was finally able to log in at 3pm and close out his position.   Just goes to show that these networks aren't stressed tested as well as they could be. I wonder how other brokerages faired as I have considered switching to IB/Lime's LightSpeed (to use the CBOE's LiveVol software)/TastyWorks/E\*Trade.It was very surprising to see that not only did the data take literally minutes to load after inputting a symbol for a chart but also when switching symbols the charts would still show the previous symbols data!   Side note: I wonder how the more capitalized clientele faired. The more I have with them, the more revenue I trade for them, the better I expect my connection/fills to be!

Weirdest thing I can see is that the Amazon chart is showing a high below the current price. Also, I think you can hold your mouse over the chart and it'll display the price at that time and date (although not on the top bar). Just saying these pictures don't really seem to prove your point. Do you have anything a little more definitive?
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 11:53:53'] This is seriously making me reconsider my switch to ToS. Currently using RH. The fill prices are awful and there are virtually no built in analytical tools.

Also the options quotes were continuously showing wrong numbers. This nearly had me liquidated and I was stressing the whole week. TD Ameritrade even closed out positions on my behalf inevitably causing me to lose thousands of dollars. If anyone is thinking of filing a class action lawsuit please PM me as I have evidence including video and screenshots. It’s really unbelievable that they did this robbery to retail.

You used to be able to look at the daily charts going all the way back to 1929 on SPX, now you can only see monthly and higher and it lags like crazy when you try to see that far back -- it will only load a few years at first and then after having it open for half an hour it might show you the old data.This isn't even Ameritrade anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-29 09:36:06'] I don’t use TOS because I’m a scalper and their prices are minutes behind at times. I thought I was crazy but some guy on reddit confirmed it and since then I won’t touch there bloated software. Also I was using their simulation stuff once and I had a stop order in 10% below current trading prices and out of nowhere it got triggered for 50% of the stocks current trading price(the stock was still trading at the same price with no weird candles). Now that simulation was for a competition that I was winning, I spent weeks asking them to give my paper money back but they just kept giving me the run around until they just said no so I said fuck you guys I’m going to Schwab. If that mistake happened in real life they would have been subject to a very large investigation and civil lawsuit.

POST: ['2023-04-10 09:34:48'] POST TITLE: b'Taking advantage of volatility spikes in meme stocks'
POST_TEXT: b"I'm largely of the opinion that meme stocks are poor investments and it's best to stay away from selling options on them. However their occasional intraday volatility provides some very nice vega-centric opportunities on the option chain. A couple good examples of this lately have come with AMC and GME.\n\n[I have a video detailing how this works here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7IQSeGdZLE). It should help explain things a little more visually but for more detail I'm writing it all out below:\n\nFor a little background, this approach looks to capitalize in a large intraday or overnight spike in a stock. The opportunity allows for us to sell puts out of the money and profit as the stock settles. The great part is that we don't have to get in early and guess which way the stock will run, but rather we wait for the volatility and use that opportunity to react to it. \n\nMore specifically, we look for 4 main points on these trades. \n\n**1) A spike in the stock.** This one is pretty self exp"
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 10:27:24'] You mentioned vega (which means you are looking at a pure volatility trade) without once talking about delta hedging. As a result you have both volatility AND delta/drift exposure, which means you're one piece of news away from a spectacular blowup. I understand you are looking to stay in a trade a few minutes but that's all it takes to lose far more than these pennies you are picking up. Convexity cuts both ways.On stocks this volatile and unpredictable, pure naked short trades are inadvisable. If you are happy with 1% returns naked, you should be just as happy with 0.5% returns (or less) hedged. Pure volatility plays should have delta exposure hedged away.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 19:25:28'] This seems like a high risk low reward strategy. This looks like something you need a 95% win rate to be profitable. A big loss would wipe a year of profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 12:11:34'] This is interesting, and reflects my thinking too.    2) Re "Good news driving the spike"  That makes complete sense. When you calculate a stock's volatility based on past variations in its price, and use the Black–Scholes model to calculate the appropriate price for the PUT option, the assumption is made that that volatility will continue into the future. But if you have a big move in the price that increases this volatility and hence the price of the PUT, the reality is that this extra volatility won't continue into the future (because it came from a discrete news event). Therefore if you sell short the PUT you are receiving more money for it than you should, giving rise to an average profitable trade.  Now the question is, do more sophisticated traders understand this principle, and choose to ignore the news-related move in their calculations of what they want to pay for the option? I don't know. But presumably there are some, perhaps a lot, of traders out there who don't make this adjustment, and in error regard the value of the option as being higher than it really is. You profit by trading against them.    3) "There must be an established trading base"  Maybe. But I'm inclined to think the only purpose of this is that it might reduce historical measured volatility, meaning that when the news spike comes, it makes a bigger difference, so increasing the effect of 2) above.    4) "There must be decent option premium at the trading base"  Yes, but it is important to understand why there is higher option premium. The AMC is a case in point. In AMC's case the PUT options are much more expensive than the CALL options for strike prices nearly the same as the share price. This would partially explain the positive returns you are seeing, but only because of the Theta (time) decay of the option.  Now normally this CALL/PUT difference (absent a dividend payment) would give rise to a risk-free arbitrage situation, because all you need to do is sell the expensive PUT, buy the cheap CALL, and then go short on the underlying stock. This exactly neutral position guarantees a profit equal to the difference in the PUT and CALL prices.  Well normally it would. But in the case of AMC, for reasons I won't go into here, there is a huge interest rate (around 800% per annum), charged by the market in order to borrow the stock (needed to sell it short). The daily interest charged by this offsets the gains from that trade.

The opportunity allows for us to sell puts out of the money and profit as the stock settles. The great part is that we don't have to get in early and guess which way the stock will run, but rather we wait for the volatility and use that opportunity to react to it. Following fresh volatility spikes is the most consistent winner I have and I should really just go back to doing it 100% as nothing has been as reliable as selling CSPs during these intraday/overnight moves.A lot of people don't seem to notice how both the puts and calls go up during some of these 50-100% moves, which is what I focus on.  At this point I've been doing it so long that I have a general feel for what kinda fills I can get, especially important when they are low volume/not very liquid.  I'm a bit of a stickler trying to get the most outrageous fills I can, so most of my limits never hit... but when they do, quite nice.I even made a little [website](https://larval.com) based around the intraday moves, I just have it running in the background during the work day and take a gander when a move I'm interested in happen.Another winner I've noticed during these events, other than the CSPs, is the calendar crunch that happens.  You can frequently find that the current months strikes are trading for almost the same amount as several months to a year out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 03:53:33'] Interesting idea which seems illogical – sell PUT right after its price dropped.But the main idea is to find someone who’s ready to pay a good price for that PUT. Looks possible…I don’t think this is due to any irregularity in option pricing from a theoretical point of view.After a spike in the stock, there is a good chance that somebody’d like to take profit on this PUT sold earlier. He just wants to unlock capital, so there is no big difference for him between $0.10 and $0.12 if he sold it for $2.00. But for you it’s a huge difference.I would suggest to use diagonal spread, i.e. to buy 1 PUT with higher strike instead of pure selling. Like this you’ll have some delta hedge. But it reduces overall premium sharply, and may be considered as another strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 16:53:23'] You have two examples in the last few weeks. This isn’t enough data to draw any conclusions from. You should be doing it for at least six months first.

But, a 3x like this makes it seem like you can duplicate this with your entire portfolio over and over, but 300% compounded annualized returns has been impossible.So certainly there are losses, or if not losses, then position sizes that reduces the effective 300% return to something more earthly.Care to share?

They sold to open 1,000 of each PUT and CALL September 18 contracts at the $3015 strike price to collect a total of $47 million in premium. The player stays profitable if AMZN stays in between a price range of $2,500-$3,500. The closer AMZN stays at $3,000 price after earnings, the morning money the player will keep.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-19 13:29:55'] Pretty new to options here, I saw a similar article in Yahoo finance about 40k calls being bought for GE 10c 1/15/21. I'm not really sure how well of an indicator that is but I threw some money at it to keep track of it and take it as a learning experience on following some of the big players.The 40k calls were split between 3 accounts (unknown whether they were individuals or firms) 1 for 2000 calls, 1 for 5000, and 1 for 32000.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 14:28:32'] One thing that I was taught is that I have no control over how much profit I make on a trade.  It is what the market decides to give me and I am psychologically able to handle. I can only control when I enter a trade and when I exit.That said, I would recommend running a test on changing your exit rules.  Take small trades for the next 20 trades and measure how your win rate increases/decreases compared to how you are currently trading.  Only then will you know if your proposed rules will benefit you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 15:30:29'] > Is a TP percentage between 20-50% too small?A successful scalper that posted here a few years back used $.10 profit or $.05 loss. Cents, not percents. Well, actually dollars since x100, but you get what I mean. So that should give you an idea of how whack 20-50% is as a goal.> Now my goal is to trade smarter and more disciplined.Then stop worrying about woulda/shoulda/coulda. The trade you exited **for a profit** could have ended up a huge loss if you held longer. Focus on making good trade decisions and let go of what happens afterwards. Ideally you should be completely indifferent to what happens after your exit a trade. It's literally none of your business.More details about trading decisions and good trading mindset here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourdecisionsAnd the cousin of your FOMO mindset is results-oriented thinking, where you make a bad trading decision but justify it by a good (lucky) outcome: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 16:53:04'] I took a look at my YTD return and I’ve returned 14% so far this year for the first four months. Annualized that’s 48%. And you think 27% over a week or two is small?Calculate the average annual return for 27% profit in a few weeks and tell me if “that’s too small”. If I can keep up a 48% average annualized return I will be a billionaire in less than 20 years before I hit 60. I’ve been trading options for three years, took a couple years to get really good and develop a replicable strategy. Do the math and you will see how even just a thousand bucks with a return of “only 27%” in a week or less will be in 10 years. But of course the key is replicating that return over and over without taking an inordinate amount of risk (and losing it all). I’ve found that by selling put credit spreads and wheeling on high quality stocks, I can reduce risk AND return 20-40% a year (about 0.5 - 1% a week).
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 14:48:12'] Ok, let's take a step back. Is 20%-50% too small? My man, Warren Buffet is considered the greatest investor of all time and he averaged below 40% returns **per year**. If you were able to make one trade per week and return 20%, you'd have well over a 1,000,000% return per year. The question isn't what is a good target percentage return, the question is whats the expected return of your strategy. If your stop loss is 25% and your target return is 20%, then you obviously have to win more often than you lose otherwise your strategy will be a loser. But 20% is a fantastic return on an annualized basis, so yes compounding small returns is great but if you think a 20% return is small then you need to readjust your expectations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 15:56:23'] the 8 mega techs, TSLA AAPL AMD NVDA etc are usually tracking the /NQ to some extent, so if that turns against you or contract spread or volumes on AMZN stock chart candles turn against you, that's 3 possible signals take profit (of many).  some people say to watch Chicago exchanges that are setup for derivatives dealers like CHX...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 15:08:21'] An appropriate profit goal depends on the underlying stock so there's no answer that fits all trades. I'll take 25% on any of a number of signals, and I'll take 50% for many trades, but for some I'll hold for 80%. A 25% stop loss on options trades will generate a lot of stopped out trades. Options need room to move. I usually use a mental 50% stop loss.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 13:31:24'] I’ve been focusing on trading pullbacks/retracements and back testing my strategy. Today I put the strategy to use and I feel like I could’ve had a better entry… would it be best to enter when the bullish/bearish continuation signal is forming or after it closes?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 16:42:07'] This is why I sell options. Maximum profit is known and I don’t worry about FOMO. You can always make more but think: you will never hit the max profit buy being long on a call or put or stock 100% of the time. To do so would require a crystal ball. I learned that the hard way when I was trading SI and selling CCs on it. It had gone up to 220 or something and I had sold a call at 240. It then crashed of course and I finally got out at 80. I took an 8k loss but had I kept holding I would’ve lost the rest of the 8k.

POST_TEXT: b" \n\nLooking at SNAP and PINS taking a hit with FB, I was wondering if there's a way to play the short side on AMZN earnings without the crazy IV crush. Any ideas on stocks that move in tandem with AMZN that could take a hit if AMZN tanks?\n\nOr for that matter any other such plays for upcoming earnings where you can bet on another stock that is highly correlated with one?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 15:19:09'] If you're set on AMZN going down for earnings you can always join the IV crush.Sell a short dated call option for the first expiration after earnings, and buy a long dated call option for a longer dated expiration. If AMZN does collapse, the IV crush and collapse in value from your short call should more than make up for the premium lost by the long call.The trade is made for a debit and considered a "covered" trade by your brokerage.Or buy a longer dated put option.  Typically earnings IV only occurs on the near dated expirations, anything over 2-3 months out won't be affected too much.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-02 20:12:37'] >I was wondering if there's a way to play the short side on AMZN earnings without the crazy IV crush. Yeah.. pretty easy. Chose between 1) Short the stock 2) Sell calls

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 21:32:06'] You’ll use margin which is never a good ideaBasically brokers love people like yourself who make questionable trades they don’t have collateral for and then they get to charge you interest on the position while it (likely) continues going south.

Most brokers will do the same, because they're not going to take the risk themselves.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-21 11:37:29'] My typical hold period for leaps is about 45 days. My typical return is about 50%. The ironic part is the ones I held that are about to go long term (all bought between March & April) I am up about 200+%.I don’t expect to see that so quickly but easily see Amazon at $4K by the end of the year making option prices too cheap after Friday’s sell off.

For GOOG I seen that I can make $900 max profit  spending only $60. I set it to sell two calls at $2770 and $2780 and bought two at $2760 and $ 2790. I know this is risky because of the possibility of getting assigned but how risky and how likely am I to get assigned and would the calls I bought cover it?

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 17:54:55'] Rolling a call is technically the end of the old and the start of a new. Each roll is a separate taxable event. For tax purposes, rolled calls won't count for long term capital gains unless you held the original option and then rolled them at a year + 1 day into a new a option.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 21:55:39'] While you ended up ahead you would have ended with a net loss if you stopped counting beginning of may. While I am not saying that covered calls aren't a good way to increase profit on a holding, it just looks like the maintaining the cc atm stabalized your profit from the options seems to hover around 0.What are your thoughts? I think attempting to keep the cc slightly out of the money may have produced better gains.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 21:58:24'] Interesting play. Essentially mimics the [BXM index](https://www.cboe.com/us/indices/dashboard/bxm/), but for Amazon instead of the S&P. That will always outperform the underlying if it stays flat or trends downward and underperform if it trends upwards. It reduces volitility in all cases though.Did you just start by selling an ATM call and continuously rolled it to keep it ATM regardless if the roll resulted in a loss or profit? When did you roll - near expiration? Or just when it stopped being ATM? How many days to expiration?
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 19:37:26'] you got 100 shares of Amazon? nice.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 00:54:54'] I would be careful moving forward, it’s just a gut feeling but with bezos out and the stock trading sideways for so long it seems primed for a split this year. My guess is that could cause your CC to get assigned and I looks like your not trying to wheel, which would also be a lot more risky after a split anyways due to the now upward momentum.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-19 05:30:08'] You should use an equation to select your strike price. You won’t need to be rolling nearly as much. I use: strike = price (1 + IV * sqrt(1 / 26))The 1/26 means I’m selling 2 week options. Monthly options would be 1/12, and weekly would be 1/52 etc

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-29 18:02:52'] Learn from this and try not to let it happen again. If you can not afford to go broke you should have sold put spreads instead of selling naked.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-29 21:43:41'] I would simply roll out in time. With almost no time value left you have a good chance at rolling for at least a small credit. Buy yourself some time to be right.

You might be able to close it at a small loss, or no loss at all. Because there's only a day left, there's not a lot you can do. After hours is meaningless, I wouldn't react until market opens. Because there's not enough time to manage, all you can really do is hope it doesn't go ITM and close it out.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 05:53:39'] what a pickle - but actually the situation might not be as bad as it seems :)AMZN is trading at 3354 right now in pre-market, so just buying back the put at the open seems possible - in all likelihood it will just expire worthless. other options worth considering:A. roll over, as others have mentioned: buy back your 3300 put and sell a 3300 put for AUG06 (or even further out)- as mentioned, IV will probably drop next week creating a bit of a further lossB. buy an OTM put farther out, also expiring today - turning your naked put into a defined risk play - you could pick a strike that creates a worst-case scenario which still is not catastrophic - in all likelihood this second put will go to 0 today thoughC. short stock, as mentioned: if you short 100 shares of AMZN before your put is assigned, assignment takes you back to 0. the trouble might be that there is not enough margin in the account.D. do nothing and get assigned: might sound counterintuitive - but this worst case   bad: the general sentiment is that AMZN will rebound soon. should you really be assigned, you'd be getting 100 shares of AMZN at what most people consider to be a good price for entry. however! it does sound like holding 333k of AMZN stock might be problematic for your account and would trigger margin call / liquidation. also not the best approach to risk management. best to talk to your broker beforehand, orcombining C+D you could also adjust your position during the day should price approach 3300. as an example, if you short 90 shares, after assignment you'd still be holding 10.in any case, don't panic. everything can be worked out. should things go sideways and you'd be assigned: don't be alarmed if your account shows a negative 333k balance - this is offset by the 100 shares of AMZN which are also worth around the same amount and expected to bounce back soon.good luck!

Since this post is about you...Going with the jan 23 long calls at 3500 for $450, you need 4000 ish to break even, 4500 to make a nice profit.    Certainly amzn can achieve that.    Pmcc can work to offset your cost,  or make a synthetic long for a credit @3600 can be sweet.   Consider that amzn seems to trade side ways for a year or more,  then lurches forward at random intervals.I expect amzn train to keep on rolling, higher and higher levels,  but you really need to be long the stock if you can manage it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 12:50:17'] I think further rise is quite likely - however, imho there's also a high probability of crash between now and Jan'23 - events such as taper/rate hike will lead to gyrations - all things considered I'd hedge your position - either in the form of hedged calls or by addition of an OTM put component (or another form of tail hedge somewhere else in your portfolio)

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 15:33:21'] There is no such thing as free money.  A LEAP gives you more time to be right about direction, and TA is always prediction in hindsight.

Whatever it is, if you're going to buy, think of the consequences if you're wrong, and don't let one trade blow up your account.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-04 15:52:41'] I understand you think it's risk free, a safe bet, but it isn't. Nothing is. While it's of course most likely that amzn goes up, it might also not! Amzn Motto was the whole "it's always day one". With Jeff giving the executive job Up, this is a hardly feasible or credible line. AWS, the cash cow, is losing market share to every competitor. This is really bad!Amzn is arguably the most likely target for an antimonopoly breakup, and would be the hardest hit. Facebook or Google would profit from having spin offs.

I picked up the $3200 calendar like two days before the split announcement, and right now I am up around 12k.\n\nI am debating how to proceed with my positions. Should I roll the shorts and the April call all the way to 5/20 to make a butterfly since the price has risen so much recently?Should I roll the shorts to the same strike and try to roll for a credit each week?

For the May calendar  at 2700,  with a net cost of around $250,  you are concerned to not lose that $250.  If AMZN heads down rapidly, you might not recover that original outlay.   You can roll the short from 3/18 at 2900 up about 100 dollars, expiring April 22, for around zero net credit to 3000, and if AMZN stays up above 3000, you could have about a 5,000 gain in April, or roll the short again, all this without putting more money into the trade.      AMZN famously moves around, and it is difficult to capture its location unless you have about three or four calendar spreads at the same time, about $100 to $200 from each other.    If AMZN falls below 2900, you may end up with a loss on this, through April.      You could roll the short out in time, to May, in April, and roll it up or down.    Ideally, given the cost of the original calendar, net of 250, you want AMZN to be above 250 + 2700 for above 2950 for a gain, in May.    ---  The 3200 April 22 calendar, you could roll the short out week by week, collecting an additional credit, and maintaining flexibility to move the short in future rolls.    Right now, rolling out a week to March 25, is a net of about $16  credit. This is a pretty happy roll to do every week, given the original net cost of the calendar to be around $15 to start with. You have about four more rolling opportunities. ---  The above was written from the perspective of maximum flexibility to move the shorts around in the future.  You could elect roll them out now, deciding between credit versus moving to a new strike price.    You could exit now, and avoid the risk that AMZN goes down again, taking the easy gains while you have them. ---

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 10:39:11'] AMZN was pushed down by good earnings and but weak guidance for Q3. Of course you can't bet against AMZN but I think it will trade sideways for a while. Today it broke down it's 200 SMA. Although a call doesn't seem like a bad play. Next level of resistance is in the 3390ish. Maybe I would do a longer DTE than two weeks, something between 30-45 so you don't get theta gang banged haha. Just my two cents. Good luck!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 15:13:21'] Amazon is cyclical. Check the charts. Second half is typically down and sideways movement. Big growth follows the dip in late Feb/early March and runs until Q2 earnings in July/august.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 13:07:28'] Watch that 10yr bond yield rate, Amazon usually moves when the yield is going up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 17:10:01'] Two weeks is **far** too short of a time span. Amazon is expensive, buy a debit spread. After the IV cooled off after the earnings drop I opened a 3550/3750 spread for 9/16/22. It doesn't have to be this wide, but if you think Amazon is going to be even marginally higher than it is now in a year you can make a lot of money. This one in particular cost $6,500 and pays out $13,000 if Amazon is over 3750 in a year.

It's hard to look at options just based on one of the Greeks.AMZN options are high priced and a small move down in AMZN pps or change in iv can obliterate an option premium.  I would not evaluate potential plays based on delta.  I would look at them based on time and how far in or out the money they are.

I bought two calls and I sold one before the market closed, I'm still holding to one call (AUG 27 $3230)and I migh sell it today. The reason I only did two weeks and delta 0.5 is because I was expecting a fast rebound like the one from yesterday I just didn't know it was going to be on the same day, The risk is higher but is a good return. AMZN went from 3220 and closed at 3299.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 08:05:42'] Like everyone is saying it's definitely not a cheap stock to buy options in. With my little baby sized account I might do a call spread though because it definitely has fallen quite a bit recently

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 12:36:14'] So, the DCX position is what's known as a cashless collar. Whoever put this on probably has a large position is stock that is tied up in some way.  May not be able to sell, and rather than risk any downside between now and when they can sell, they sell a call and use the premium to buy a put. They are sacrificing any upside to protect against any downside. Mark Cuban did the same with some stock that the got when his company was acquired. The stock tanked, but  the put minimized his losses. Mostly used by folks who are prohibited from selling for a particular period.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 12:37:53'] Would it be a good move for an inexperienced investor to send some money that way too, mirroring these big orders?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-05 07:08:28'] Thanks for sharing this. Regarding DXC, what makes you so sure that the Call strike was a sale? It was transacted at the offer, not mid or the bid, as was the PUT side. This could be a simple premium play where the player does not expect a big move before expiration and is slightly bullish, selling premium on both side before a rally.

POST_TEXT: b'I have some AMZN shares in a margin account. I was thinking after the earnings call, depending on the move I could profit from the higher than average premiums at this time i.e. if there is a large drop by tomorrow, I can sell a put further away from the dropped price (and at a range I would still be comfortable owning the shares). If there is a good gain, then I can sell CC further away from the risen price. Do people usually do this?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 10:11:18'] Yes, its a doable strategy. There are still rich premiums in the morning after an earnings call.If there is a big drop, either sell a put, or for better capital usage, buy a deep ITM further out long put and sell a short put with a much closer expiry (put diagonal).
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 11:05:21'] IV drops considerably after earnings. Premiums go down a lot. But if you buy/sell before earnings that's a risk which is why Premiums are so nice. I have 100/95 credit put spreads on Amazon and I still have $60 left on the spreads that expires tomorrow
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 15:42:36'] I feel like you get a few things with ER.1) Big move that exceeds call/put pricing and that is profitable2) Moves less than expected, and options become cheap following ER.  Options ending that week, at the right opportunity can be found for less than $1. It’s often during the morning volatility that you pick up the opposite direction dirt cheap.Usually you get #1 or #2. Both produce good profit potential. But #1 is often great or awful, and IV rush is cruel and there isn’t much you can do between open and close. #2 often you and picking up options super cheap… if you pay $0.20 it doesn’t have to move much to 2x, 3x etc.. but requires active management.Just my thoughts.

I liked his energy in chicago  pits You can also do all courses on OIC, CBOE, and OCC. Google search it, i watched all the videos and passed all the exams/quizzes yrs ago. Pretty sure it was all free. Do the very good courses free at TASTY trade learning center. Do both beginners & advanced. I highly recommend this. Overby - option playbook. 90% visuals and payoff diags but damn he crushed this book. I feel like this is a must own. Get hardcover Option alpha - free videos and coursesIBKR campus - go to traders academy courses - free videos and quizzes Bloomberg market concepts - its a low cost course/ it has a decent section on options. If i ran a capital markets 101 class, I would make all freshmen do this before day 1. Just FYISang lucci - he was more active back in the day and his old you tube videos from 2013-15 on order flow sweeps and ATM weeklies on fangs are fun as heck to watch. I like his focus on tape and bc he was trained as a prop trader, he has good fun read on mkt microstructure. Think or swim/TDAM - free videos, covers need to knows @ learning centerCME institute - free "all about options" course @ their learn center MID LEVEL ---->Spina/Sosnoff - tom a goat and chicago legend; concise book and zero fluff Mcmillan - get 5th edition of strategic investments. Consensus bible and weighs more than a cinderblock Natenberg - perennial favoriteHull - goat but denseADVANCED/OTHER ANGLES ---->Mcmillan on optionsThe option edge - very academic, but has its moments where it really loops in everyday stuff, like market makers and why Berkshire sells OTM puts. Content good - problem is they printed only paperback size 5 font so its basically unreadable without a magnifying glass. Podcasts - ally options playbook is the best (apple, spotify) Colin bennett - trading volatility / cool stuff in here that is not found elsewhereJeff augen - he wrote 3 gems, all on amazon Trading option greeks - dan parsanelli. Well-scoped bookHow to Calculate option prices and their greeks - UrsoneIntrinsic - mike yuen. Entire book about leaps on tech names during a bull cycle. For practical purposes, ch 5-10 are good and in plain language cover his actual trades; those looking for an actual trader perspective might enjoy this. Intelligent option investor - takes a value investor approach, covers lot of ground/key conceptsTaleb - dynamic hedging - hard to find book / deep practical philosophical. This dude is smart!! Sinclair - he has 3 books i have yet to readBEAST MODE/FINAL THOUGHTS -->regarding exams...consider the CFA FRM CMT CFP CAIA CIPM CTP exams. All levels of all these exams touch the subject in some form or another. The first 2 treat it far more rigorously. CTP way too light a treatment, unfortunately. CMT focuses lot on vix. CFP covered the meat and potatoes better than i expected. Should you want the journal entries for how companies book stock comp/option awards, becker CPA far books really cover the must-knows. Pursue MBA - most top programs default to hull in the derivatives class & authors that both the FRM/CFA base their actual exams on. Adding this in case someone is looking at bschool/MSF down the road.Lastly, if looking for a gift idea or curious what it was like on the floor years ago, "trading pit hand signals" by carlson is one sweet as fk coffee-table book. Its true, the traders have seperate gestures for straddles and strangles. Best of luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-03 14:10:47'] Huh? How did you not recieve the premium at the time you OPENED the spread???
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-03 14:40:51'] This is an odd one and shows why letting spreads expire is a terrible idea! AMZN popped up after the market closed to $3489 around 4:29pm ET.  The option buyer has until 5:30pm ET to contact their broker to assign and this can be based on the afterhours price move.If you were shorted the stock your broker will buy the shares on the market for the current price and then "loan the shares" to you to sell to the option buyer at the strike price of $3480.  If this occurred then you will be getting those funds of $348,000 added to your account on Monday or Tuesday at the latest (this is a holiday weekend so likely Tuesday or even Wednesday).You will need to buy the stock to replace what the broker loaned you at the market value when you have the cash on Monday or Tuesday.  If the stock price drops then you can buy these cheaper, but if the stock rises then you may owe more.  If it rises too much I suspect the broker will close out the position for you, especially if you have a smaller account that cannot support a large loss.The long protective leg expired worthless so is now gone and can offer no protrection.It is usually posted multiple times each week to not let spread options expire.  See what can happen in this video, and you should find out tomorrow if you were assigned or not.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVFj9nRRDo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVFj9nRRDo)  With luck you were not assigned, but if you were then hopefully AMZN stays well behaved and maybe even drops some.

Keep in mind a sudden spike in volatility (even due to loss in value counter-intuitively) can sometimes see the option price spike in particular during open/close or un-priced real world events.    Worst case you'll have to cancel your limit when you sell at a loss in a day or two. Best case you break-even due to spikes.

POST: ['2021-04-29 14:41:54'] POST TITLE: b'Negative value on $AMZN option?'
POST_TEXT: b'Hi guys, \n\nSecond day as an option trader, I bought an $AMZN call that expires for next week (May 7) $3550. After hours on $AMZN > $3600. I was ITM the entire day but at close it went negative? Any idea what is going on? \n\nBTO: 3 units @ $56.50. \n\nThanks.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 15:05:09'] ITM (in the money) is an option (for calls) where the strike price is less than the stock price. The amount by which a stock is ITM is the intrinsic value of the option. Amzn was around $3470 today, a strike at $3550 is OTM and has no intrinsic value, it is 100% extrinsic value (or time value).Option lose value every day, the extrinsic value decreases. At expiry, all extrinsic value will be gone and only intrinsic value will remain.I'm curious if you know how much risk there was in this position?What exactly went negative? It's hard to answer your question, if you saw an option price that went negative, you have to mostly ignore after-hour option quotes.Side-note, congrats, but be prepared for the price to not be as good as you think - it is a bit early to celebrate just yet. The intrinsic value of a $3550 strike with Amzn at $3600 is $50. If you sell close to expiry, the fair value will be $50. If you're awake during market open, monitor the price closely and IMO sell at least 1 of those options at whatever price if Amzn is at $3620 or better. If you wait too long, every hour, that extrinsic value will decrease. Also expect a large decrease in the extrinsic value on open due to reduced volatility. Now that earnings has been reported, option prices will drop significantly, maybe something like a third or half even.So, you need to play this somewhat carefully. I think if you can exit with 2 @ $70 and 1 @ $85, you'll have done really well. There could be profit taking in Amzn tomorrow, it's not a given the price will continue to run and could easily slump down to lower $3500s (for example, Aapl crushed it, yet they finished today \*down\* by a dollar).Unsolicited advice, put an open order to sell at $70 for one of the options and hope that executes on open. Otherwise monitor the market in the morning and be ready to sell another at $60 if the price decreases. If the price runs up then sell your second at something like $80 and sell that last one for $85\~$100 if you can. I would also try really hard to sell within the first 3 hours of the market being open, after that and you'll start losing a lot of extrinsic value quite rapidly  (ballpark perhaps something like $10/hr on the option price).
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 14:45:37'] True prices are only shown during trading hours. After hour prices only reflect the bid or ask at close and are not relevant
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 15:05:21'] Do you know what you're doing in options? 16k is a lot of money without knowing how options work
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-30 06:04:38'] Before earnings there is higher implied volatility due to speculation of large gains or loses upon earnings. Once the earnings report hits, traders get a better idea of where the stock is going, leading to what is known as IV crush.You are likely to lose quite a bit of money if amzn doesn't stay above your breakeven of 3606.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 17:15:29'] Implied volatility drops after earnings which is a large part of the extrinsic value especially if you bought 2 days ago.  Look up extrinsic vs intrinsic value of options.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-29 14:50:31'] I think it’s due to after-hours trading. Sometimes the bid/ask can get all messed up after-hours. When the market opens back up the options will return to their real value.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-29 14:41:09'] Here are my predictions for what it is worth. I am prepared to be wrong and I appreciate OPs post!AAPL - Probably lower than expected revenues. Their stores were closed so that really hurts them and they were closed for a good chunk of the quarter. Furthermore, I read somewhere that when they opened stores, a majority of the customers were not there for new purchases, but for repairs. Their products are expensive and unemployment can't be good for their premium product sales (iphones, laptops, etc.). Big pull back after down into the $350s/$360s.Last note I forgot - hence the edit: The iphone announcement will be HUGE. I read some rumors that they are looking to Q4 now and NOT a September release for the new phone. 49.7% if Apple's revenue comes from Iphone sales!  If they are still pushing for September, all quarterly sales news, good or bad will not even matter. $400+ here we come!AMZN - Amazing revenues.... like insane revenues from both goods and AWS. But lower earnings due to added COVID measures. Small 3-5% pull back into the $2800s, maybe even a bit into the $2700s. AWS is my watch here. MSFT's Azure really crushed it last week. Either they are eating into AWS OR remote work will propel them. The earnings bar is set really high for them so I worry that even as well as they do, they still might disappoint.GOOGL/FB - Who friggin' knows. I can't imagine companies are spending a ton of marketing dollars AND laying people off. That doesn't make sense.NASDAQ/Tech Bubble - There is a retraction UNTIL the new stimulus is passed. And then things pop back up to where they are now. OR until good COVID news is generated (good vaccine, numbers going down, etc.)&#x200B;TL;DR - Fu\*k tomorrow is a really big and frankly scary day. Right now I am leaning more towards a red AH and Friday :( Hope I am wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-30 03:24:14'] Thanks for the work on the post. Would be interest in other peoples thoughts but here are mineAMZN - I'm thinking due to the various COVID-19 travel restrictions, AMZN had to deal with distribution issues (i.e. rerouting trucks, extra expense with moving inventory), AWS probably killed it, but this will be continually off set by the expense associated with COVID 19 in warehouses.I'm expecting a drop.APPL - I agree with someone that posted earlier, purchases of new phones and devices were slowed by shut downs, and I read somewhere that cook announced subscriptions on news app was down. I anticipate people trimmed their subscriptions, so reoccurring rev. will be downFB - Who knows, when I log in I always see these "stock Gurus" pumping their programs. I anticipate that advertisers are going to move to that vs TV especially given sports are just coming backGoogle - Similar thoughts with facebook, but everyone in states with high covid 19 had to move to online advertising, and also I think their cloud infrastructure is growing.

However, this week sees the FOMC decision on Wednesday, Non-farm payrolls on Friday and a slew of big-cap tech earnings. All of which could be market-moving. SPY options for the week are pricing about a 2% move, and obviously, with reports from Apple, Amazon, and more, QQQ options are pricing a larger move, nearly 3%. As mentioned here over the past few weeks, traders need to be aware of the overall vol environment as that can set up for underpriced options in names that see earnings misses.

Did you get on the good side of vega? How did you know that IV was going to contract? Did you know in advance what the Fed minutes was going to say? How much of your play was delta, theta and vega? Did you specifically plan to sell the AAPL put after earnings? why did you sell one before and one after earnings? Do you have an opinion on earnings volatility? Were you trying to scalp the movement of the options? What if it had gone against you? Would you have hedged? Would you hedge with options or with stock?You see -- there's 100 different factors to consider beyond a straight up or down. And the reason for having so many factors is so next time, you can make a similarly informed decision
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 12:30:31'] I put on some AAPL 110P, GOOG 80P, AMZN 65P this week. Probably won't hit but if it does, I'll be happy to own them.

POST: ['2022-01-22 23:34:07'] POST TITLE: b'Stock Repair Strategy on AMZN'
POST_TEXT: b'Stock Repair Strategy on AMZN\n\nSo I like many fellow traders have had a rough week. I sold a amzn csp a few months ago at a strike of 3590 I know it was pretty stupid of me but I liked amazon especially with newer variants coming out and I assumed even with that pretty high strike I could sell CCs and make a decent amount of premium. Now Im down around 20% and I have been doing a lot of research into different Stock Repair Strategies and have pretty much narrowed it down to two. Sell a covered call below my cost basis and roll if it ever gets threatened or use a ratio spread to lower my cost basis. Now no matter how much research I do I still cannot figure out how doing a ratio spread on this position would allow me to break even. Can someone please explain to me how doing a ratio spread or some other stock repair strategy would improve my cost basis. Anyone other helpful suggestions on strategies, tips, literally anything at all would be most appreciated.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-23 00:42:16'] Buying the dip would lower your cost basis. Selling covered calls would too. Just depends on how fast you want to “repair” your position. And you say ‘break even’, do you not expect Amazon to go back up eventually and expect to exit the trade as soon as you do? If I was bullish on the stock I would sell cc’s until the price goes up and continue afterwards or if bearish if thinking it’ll go lower just exit the trade.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-01 15:55:43'] No insane in-depth strategy here, just working on pure options pricing and anticipated good news after AAPL reported strong holiday sales. I looked for cheap OTM weeklies that I thought would really appreciate exponentially after earnings. I actually put my sell order in after hours for a limit @ $30.00 and when I saw the order go through a good bit above that I was pretty stoked.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-02 12:50:39'] This is awesome, thanks for sharing. I’m just learning about options so this was instructive. By contrast I own one share of Amazon and it’s appreciated 13%, or roughly $230. But it took a lot of capitol to get that one share and this is a relatively small gain (and still unrealized). A while back I set aside $5k to dip my toe in the stock market (I have more savings in safer Vanguard funds). The stocks I own have appreciated just over 50% so far which is nice but not the kind of money to send kids to private school (and not money in the bank yet either). Anyway, thus the interest in options. It may not be the best fit for me in the end, but I’m starting to look into it.I’m curious, and this reveals my fundamental lack of understanding about options here, but when you sell your calls to close out, who is buying them and what are they doing with them? Is anyone actually buying 100 shares of Amazon at that lower strike price? That can’t be, but if not then what are they for? I’m missing some essential understand of what options and are and how they actually work. Any help from anyone here would be appreciated. Also, nice work!

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-26 21:40:33'] Never play naked with these kinda rumors. If they beat (which they very well might) and announce split, you are looking at 3700 close on Thursday.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 04:20:45'] Not sure why you would try to open a naked call in the first place prior to earnings. You are basically asking to lose your entire account if AMZN shoots up which it very well could do. IV crush wont help you either if they go ITM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 05:58:17'] That's only a 6% move for it to hit 3650 from where it is in the premarket right now... it can and has done that in a casual afternoon.It has its earnings in a few days.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-27 08:24:05'] I would buy a call at the level it is now, hold onto it until after earnings, then if amazon does pop, you will have some protection. Hold that bought call until amazon starts to go downIt's not the best way of doing it but at least you have some protection

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 12:48:07'] Isn't VIX all screwed up since last April when CBOE started listing SPX options expiring every trading day?  Probably way more volume for the near term versus next term expirations now compared to when they last updated the calculation back in 2003 right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 08:32:16'] GEX prints have been close to the 2B-3B range hence the bulls holding the control as of late. When that number starts to come down and go negative then we can expect volatility to rise and less of the choppy and low atr days. A rise in IV will cause GEX to drop - should be good for the bears
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-05 09:29:55'] It's evident the vix is very much being manipulated with insane moves being met with very very little move in iv. As soon as market makers start to drop their hedges on an uptick in iv and a downtrend in price you will see a potential very fast collapse. Market makers and anyone that sold naked calls are fucked right now. Market makers never hedge perfectly and this is likely what we are seeing.

	COMMENT: ['2018-11-23 15:33:36'] Personally, I would wait until Tuesday before making a decision but who the fuck knows what's going to happen next.I truly think we're going to see a bounce in the market soon, and I think retail will contribute to that, but I don't like to trade based on what I THINK will happen next.So, if I were you I would hold on a little bit longer and see what happens next but I would ditch it if we don't see a bounce in AMZN soon. But that's just me. I've been pretty much completely hands off of tech and retail lately so I might not be the best person to ask. Figured I'd give you my two cents anyway in case I could offer any value.

	COMMENT: ['2018-11-24 15:38:17'] You have the advantage of two weeks left.      Who knows, maybe there will be a rip roaring rise in the next 10 market days.    If you stay in, you could, as others have suggested, sell calls for a  call debit spread. Since this is a rescue trade, consider selling at $1605, or $1610.Choices, for Monday Nov 26, using market close option chain as  Nov 23 2018:        - Exit promptly for a net loss of around $6.55 per contract   ($22.55 basis - bid $16.00)       - Sell a credit call at 1605 for a maximum net loss of $8.15. Staying in the game for potential rise.       - Sell a credit call at 1610 for a maximum net loss of $ 9.10. Staying in the game for potential rise.       You could create a call butterfly, at 1600 / 1610 / 1620, but you would need to fish for a price to get much additional credit, beyond the credit opportunities stated above. You can also consider looking at additional credits with a credit put spread from a "safe" distance below at the money, say 1350.   There is probably not much money in this move with ten market days until expiration, and this is an increased risk. Details below. ----Looking at the option chain for the market close at Nov 23 2018: AMZN Exp Dec 7 2018      1600 C  / Last 16.55 /  change -6.05 / Bid 16.00 / Ask 17.20     1605 C / Last 17.00 / change -5.36  / Bid 14.40 / Ask 16.10     1610 C / Last 14.75 / change -7.05 / Bid 13.45 / Ask 15.10	   - If you were able to sell at the closing bid at 1605C, you can lock in a maximum loss of $8.15 loss  ($22.55 cost minus a bid credit 14.40)             - Or, more optimistically, allowing for the potential rise of AMZN, making a $10 spread, selling at 1610C, a max loss of $ 9.10   ($22.55 minus bid credit $13.45)      Additional things you can do:You could sell a vertical call spread, making an iron butterfly, or an iron condor, for modest additional credit.AMZN Dec 7 2018      1615C  / Last 19.40  / change -2.05 / Bid 12.45 / Ask 14.15  /    (mid = 13.25)   1620C / Last 15.50 / change  -2.40 / Bid 11.50 / Ask 13.25   /    (mid = 12.50)Sell additional credit spread to create    Call butterfly: +1 1600C / -2 1610C /  +1 1620C    1610C bid 13.45 credit    1620C ask 13.25 debit    Net  $0.20 Credit  - Needs a better than "natural price" for worthwhile additional credit.    Fish for a price closer to the mid-bid-ask.    At mid-bid ask, a highly optimistic trade, credit could be $0.75. Credit Spread for Call Condor    1600C / 1605C / 1615C / 1620C    1615C bid 12.45      1620C ask 13.25    Net: Debit $0.80            Need better than "natural price" to have an additional credit    
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-23 22:25:56'] Convert it to a spread. Sell a call on the same date at a higher strike.It locks back in some of the money and if it does moon, you can still collect more (capped upside to limit downside)Read up on them
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-24 04:39:08'] You also bought a high amount of implied volatility. That is usually not ideal for an option buyer. You want to buy when it's low, so you can profit from an increase.If you want to cut losses, you might want to do it before AMZN stabilises and IV goes down, deflating your option.
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-26 12:17:21'] $AMZN is at 1577 right now. Looks like your specific options are trading at $34.65. If I'm not mistaken, you could resell the contracts right now and make a nice profit of around $12k.Edit: Nevermind, just saw your edit on OP. Atleast you made some profit anyways :).
	COMMENT: ['2018-11-26 13:10:13'] Glad to hear it worked out! AMZN closed @ 1581 +5.28% today.I posted a thread about what gives every trader their edge and I mentioned luck as one of my tools because as much as good traders don't want to admit it, luck still plays a role in every traders success. That isn't to downplay a good trader's skill sets, though. See, a good trader can recognize a lucky moment and take advantage of it quickly and efficiently so that they can maximize their returns or minimize their losses. Whereas, a less skillful (or shitty trader) may not be capable of determining when they've been given an opportunity by chance and they may completely fail to capitalize on it properly.Yes you got lucky, but you recognized the fact that you may have made a bad decision and you acted quickly when luck peaked it's head around the corner. It may not feel like a win but it sounds like your head is still in the game. Good work.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey guys, I am an option scalper (bot trading). I have only traded TSLA weeklies for the past year and I was trying to see what other opportunities are out there. AMZN option chain did amazing on the backtest and today when I was auto trading it, I realized how illiquid it could be. \n\nThere were a few times that bid/ask moved a few % below last traded price before any trade took place. For instance on AMZN 210604P3280, the last traded price $65, but bid and ask were at $60 and $61. This could cause a few hundred slippage on the whole position. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience on how to tackle illiquid option chains? Do you just avoid it? \n\nI am thinking of writing an strategy that closes the price at bid price whenever ask falls 3% under last traded price, but have backtested how it affects the PL yet. \n\nAppreciate any feedback'

POST: ['2023-02-02 09:00:53'] POST TITLE: b"Selling CSP's on AMC - High Premiums"
POST_TEXT: b"I was just randomly looking around at different tickers for possible plays and came across these AMC possibilities. Both have Theta around .2 or under:\n\n3/17/23 $4 Strike - $1.48\n\n3/17/23 $5 Strike - $2.29\n\nLet's say we have 10k for our CSP's. At $5 strike we can sell 20 contracts for $4,580 total premium.\n\nThat seems like a pretty good return using our 10k leverage. Wouldn't be able to get anything close to that looking at GOOG, AMZN, META, etc... (We would need to spend more on those tickers anyway obviously, but you get the point)\n\nAMC currently trades at $6.26. 52 week low is $3.77, earnings are expected around March 7, and they have a reverse split vote March 14th that, if passed, would theoretically drive price higher and get rid of some of their debt.\n\nBesides it being a meme stock, this trade doesn't appear to have much downside. If one were to get assigned they'd be getting shares at a price near the 52 week low and then they could wheel it.\n\nWhat are everyone's thoughts?"
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:38:54'] You need to do some research. AMC has a shareholder vote that is scheduled and will result in massive dilution. There is a reason puts are so high.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 09:23:08'] I could see it for the $4 strike. I think $5 is too risky. It was just trading below $4 in January IIRC. But you're right. More than likely would have a run-up before earnings.Not a bad idea.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 09:54:04'] I wouldn’t want to own that stock, so I won’t sell any puts on it. You okay with owning AMC?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 13:31:49'] I wheeled AMC when it was going crazy with game stop.  Made like 6k on 10k capital in 2 weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:28:45'] The amount of the premium, with no other metrics, will tell the story.   For AMC, I like the 4 better than the 5.  However, today it’s most likely overvalued, meaning it will likely rush down to something more realistic leaving you in a come-from-behind situation for a month.  No early 50% escape.  In this case, the number of contracts only matters if it ties up too much of your account.  Getting starry eyed over the possibilities gets dangerous.I’ll look at this for 1-2 contracts, but I don’t like it much past that.  Thanks for the tip.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 15:04:38'] I'd say leaps themselves are hedges because the long time horizon smoothes out these ups and downs. You didn't choose a 3 month call for a reason, that's inherently a hedge.I've seen my leaps go from 70% up to -40% back to 100+% up (not AMZN).You can still be careful like not putting all the money at once (something I learnt this week) even if it's all leaps.Btw, Amazon management change is much more optical than people assume. Bezos probably wanted someone to go to these congressional testimonies. (Congress feels insulted when CEOs send their deputies). He's not going away.In any case, AMZN isn't nearly as volatile as some of the high growth names. So I wouldn't be worried too much.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 15:19:13'] I'm in the same boat with Aug 3300 strike I bought recently. But I've been buying Amzn calls for a long time and I'd be shocked to have one NOT fall right after I bought it. My timing just sucks, I guess. But I always seem to come out ahead in the end so I'm just holding on for the ride. It is a shorter time frame than my usual but AMZN recently paid off my house for me so I'll give the benefit of the doubt.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 15:25:57'] This is why I love scaling into my positions. Once I like a long term play (often deep ITM leaps) I’ll sometimes take up to 6 months to build my position. Some of that is scaling in when there’s an opportunity and fundamentals haven’t changed, sometimes it’s taking on more risk if my initial position is so deep ITM it isn’t providing the leverage I want.If you have the capital and liked the position I’d potentially suggest scaling in. If you only had enough money to build your position in a single trade — that’s the risk you take. Often a fast lump sum is best, but at times DCA overperforms. That’s randomness. I had this same thing with leaps in FXI, was able to reach my full position size in late Dec during delisting fears. To be fair I was never down at that point, but it looked highly risky at the time but I didn’t even consider closing. If market crashes I still believe in my decision. Nothing you can do about rando market-wide fluxes. It was only a “wrong” decision if your DD is proven decisively incorrect.That’s right, if nasdaq drops 50% this year and Amazon goes with it, you won’t necessarily be wrong on the company. We are probably in a bubble, but there’s no telling when/if it pops. Good DD can’t save you from that. I say you’re good if nothing has materially changed.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 14:24:10'] Amazon chops around for weeks and months and suddenly with no big news the market realizes that it‘s still probably the strongest company and that it crushes every analyst‘s expectation and so suddenly has those multiple +3-5% days. Problem right now is that the market assigns the “tech“ label to amazon but at the same time it’s considered almost value because it’s not tech of the newest kind (like FSLY, DDOG, DOCU, SQ etc). So basically when tech sells off this sells off and when the Nasdaq and memes run this is stagnant because it’s also considered a value/boomer stock. That explains why it’s more than 10% off of its highs and actually negative since mid July.As soon as this stock has it‘s face ripper breaking out of its chopping range the calls will explode. But timing this bad boy is deadly so as long as your initial thesis is intact I would keep holding.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 14:16:27'] Options are active investments. I personally have a plan for those scenarios. Sometimes it is best to take profits but it ultimately comes down to your style. can't tell you you're wrong. Depends on your strat. I am financially illiterate though so please ignore me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 14:23:09'] Felt the same way about tesla, it's been a rough couple weeks for it and I admittedly have had the thought of cutting my losses and going with another larger priced investment. But I believe in what the company is doing, theyve made leaps and bounds in the auto industry and I personally believe theyll make a comeback on yet another unique idea. I'm convinced to stick with it unless the company itself throws in the towel.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-23 17:28:39'] Remember 70-75% of the movement in any ticker is the market and the sector - in aggressively moving ticker the pecentage is higher.  In a pull back there will be a ton of profit takers selling positions in the best companies and .................................Buying a call requires the ticker to move in your direction, selling cash covered puts reduces income, but the ticker does not have to move in your favor to be profitable.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-02 21:04:42'] AMZN has been flat for a while. But think about what's going on in the real world right now.  We are reopening next year and Amazon is not exactly the reopening trade.  It's also facing some of its biggest legal challenges yet.  Msft is growing azure faster than aws.Meantime of course amazon is a powerhouse.  So there's good reason for amzn to not be making big moves right now until we see how it does post covid

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-04 23:59:54'] Thanks for the excellent summary.If there are any newbies reading this threat and licking their lips, and hoping for similar returns, pls be very careful. I sense that for every 1 Carter, then must be 20 others who tried the same strategy but blew their account. But we never hear of them.Carter basically sold credit spreads, and given his 6000% return in 1.5 years, he's obviously taking a ton of risk on each trade.Going forward, he may find his returns are not so good, cos his account is now larger and his emotions will change when he's playing with much larger amounts on the line. Its easier to double $500 than it is to double $30k.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 02:30:49'] Most TastyTrade strategies I’ve seen are similar. Short vol, if it goes against you cover by selling more convexity and/or taking bigger risk (wider spreads) and manage the risk so you don’t get blown out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 06:57:30'] Bullshit story. Nobody turned $500 into $30,000 from "selling volatility". The story would have been believable if the kid had $50,000+ and turned it into more from selling options...but this story is so absurd that it can be dismissed outright.The only people turning $500 into tens of thousands of dollars are degenerates like me who buy short dated options and ride gamma and vega to Valhalla.I sell options too but selling options is the classic "takes money to make money" story and it's slow and steady. Selling options will never deliver outsized gains.Great summary breakdown! I just hate bullshit artists with bullshit stories... especially when they aren't even believable to anyone except the most gullible or inexperienced.Take TastyTrade with a heaping amount of salt too. They do stuff like this to sell their tastyworks platform and "options selling is for everyone" narrative.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 11:21:47'] In this example, I'd say you're sinking into a black hole. Averaging down is for short term dips that you can use as an oppurtinity to buy in in order to make more on the way up. The chances of Amazon increasing $600, or almost 20% by Feb 12 is highly unlikely, unless something magical happens which no one can predict or expect.Another thing to keep in mind is: If you're down 50% on an option, it would take a 100% jump in the option premium for you to just breakeven. For you to just breakeven on the options you bought at $70 that are now $17, that's more than a 400% return just to be at breakeven, less when you factor in the other contracts you bought. It's probably best to cut your losses and move on, Amazon's not hitting $3700 anytime soon so your contracts will likely approach zero quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-15 11:26:39'] Black hole. A talking head on CNBC said to buy it and his orders come from above when they want retail to get in so higher ups can get out.

POST_TEXT: b"I've mainly always traded just long calls/puts or straddles so I have a question for you guys here.\n\nLets say I bought an amzn calendar spread buying 50 105 calls for March 24th and sold 50 calls for March 17th. I know this is a very high risk trade but I'm wondering what would happen if come March 17th or prior we're above 105- do I need to close to limit losses because what would end up happening if for example it closes above 105+ after March 17th and then sells off shortly after? This is basically the worst case scenario for a calendar spread right?\n\nThank you!"
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 15:53:16'] This is not a high risk trade. This is an incredibly low risk trade. You’re buying further dated calls and selling shorter dated calls, meaning that your short calls will always be covered by the long calls. You close the trade when you’re happy with the profit. Of course you want AMZN to go up, you’re going to be long delta. If it’s over 105 before the short leg expires, the long leg will still be worth more so you’re fine. What really matters is how the long leg decays and if the spread is worth more than you bought it for at this point. Regardless, the most you can lose on this trade is the premium you pay for the spread, UNLESS you let the short leg expire in the money and don’t close out the long leg. At that point yes you are at risk of AMZN falling after the short leg expires. Personally, I’d only keep the long leg if the short leg expired worthless and I was bullish on AMZN for the next week. Otherwise, I’d sell the entire thing as a spread sometime before the early expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 18:47:10'] I tried like all the covered methods by now and I'd say calendar spreads are my favorite. Someone else explained your trade so I won't get into it but just wanted to say big fan of them
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 11:48:29'] The worst case for a calendar spread is a very large move away from the strike (up or down).  Look at a risk graph to see this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 16:00:59'] What happens if the price moves below the ATM price for the calendar spread? Do you loose the debt spread? Or do you get a profit from selling earlier call?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 18:08:22'] Credit put spread. The only thing that matters. With credit put spread, we can walk at ease on these uncertain time. Remember credit put spread, strike as low as you can, monthly yearly or weekly. Credit put spread always stay.

	COMMENT: ['2018-06-20 04:36:25'] I, personally, think the test of anti-trust should be "is it NECESSARY"? The second test should be "are there sufficient barriers to entry that a competitor could not reasonably enter the market"? That could be monopoly pricing or sufficiently large capital requirements to block new investment.There's too much hangup these days in industries that aren't anywhere necessary with regard to antitrust. The DOJ wants something to do so they stick their noses in everything. They're not business people and would tend to force two companies to potentially fail rather than merge thus creating no provider in an industry rather than a weak monopoly.

On the other hand, Amazon has made my life much simpler and less expensive, while at the same time enriching me more than any other single company has with its stock.I'm not going to sell my stock anytime soon because of this, but government regulation is one of the few serious risks I see to Amazon and I am going to keep my eye on it.

With such a long DTE, the theta gain is very very slow. With a shorter expiry, you get faster theta and can keep reselling the short call again and again as long as its OTM."3. If AMZN stock price goes up to $150 or more before expiry, exit position immediately for approx 100% gain."If the stock goes to 150 next week, you will not make 100% profit cos the short calls will have substantial time value and your 100 point wide spread will probably be worth 60ish. If the stock shoots way over 150 early, then yes, you'll get close to getting the full 100 points, which cost you 45.Nice idea though OP.Are there any blind-spots here?

I expect them to do ~125 billion in revenue and produce earnings of about 14/share, doubling the consensus estimate. \n\nNote* Unlike some of these stocks that are at all time highs going into their reports, Amazon has trended sideways for months providing a technical setup more in line with Netflix leading up to their report. \n\nKey Points:\n\n- Digital Commerce 360 estimates Amazons sales on Prime Day hit 10.4 billion globally over the two-day period spanning Oct. 13 and Oct. 14, up from $7.16 billion during the 48-hour event in July 2019.\n\n- Independent businesses selling on Amazon surpassed $4.8 billion in worldwide sales from Bl'

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-18 17:52:14'] Doesnt an IV crush occur after the ER? Eg after the news removes the uncertainty creating the high IV
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-18 18:15:09'] Remember their last quarter crushing results. Only reason it did not zoomed 8-10% up afterwards was because of jeff b retirement news. I don't see a reason why they won't crush this quarter. Expect 5% up swing
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-18 17:56:40'] The easiest way to avoid IV crush is not to hold during after hours of the actual earnings release. Earnings can provide some great trades leading into the release but for this reason but once the market closes and the news ticker starts spewing it becomes a YOLO play and for this reason I don’t usually hold through the actual earnings report. If you do want to have a position through earnings you could use a long call vertical spread. The IV crush of your sold call will offset to a large extent the IV crush of your long call. One other earnings strategy with options is to sell a wide iron condor in the hours before the market closes. A typical trade would be to sell wide enough to be outside the expected move. In this way the IV crush would be to your favor.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-18 17:08:38'] If you think there can be a good vol crush, you could get a vega negative option strategy? (I am not saying this is what you should do, I'm just asking for a friend 🙃)

Setup a limit sell for a reasonable price you'd take, and if it doesn't execute, hold through that first 30-60 minutes (if you can).If holding it puts you at too much financial risk, liquidate it and practice better risk management next time - we've all been there!

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-26 09:10:32'] If the market agrees that a stock is poised for moderate and predictable growth, you won't get much premium on your short positions. I priced several PMCCs recently and for a lot of stocks, the IV in the near term is so low that there are scenarios in which the stock price could rise in the short term and you actually lose money on the trade overall. Just be sure to pay attention to the expected profitability.Also, AMZN leaps are expensive. The November 29, 2021 2800 call will cost you over $60,000. That's not something I'd put in my portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 17:19:10'] Selling naked calls on amazon is one of the dumbest ideas I have ever heard on this sub
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 16:39:48'] Previous commenter is incorrect, you can, indeed, sell naked call options on amazon. It may be more of a gamble than it seems, and your brokerage may charge obscene margins on such a transaction, but not as much as owning shares.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 17:21:57'] You can do a [call credit spread](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/short-call-spread/) rather than a naked call to reduce the margin requirement to the width between the spread.   This is also a trade that can be done without high level trading permissions.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-27 17:37:12'] You should really only ever do this on stock you own. There’s very little reason or sense in selling naked calls, especially on a stock as expensive as amazon. Your losses can be astronomical. If however you purchased 100 shares of amazon and wrote a call against the shares to lower your basis, that would be a substantially better idea. Yes you cap your upside but you gain downside protection and collect premium as income while you roll the short calls. Plus even if amazon explodes upwards you still have a gain from your basis up to the strike of the short call. Then you can sell cash secured puts and go the other way to renter amazon if you wanted.The obvious issue is you need enough cash to buy 100 shares of amazon. Maybe find a cheaper stock and buy/write (purchase shares and sell a call) so you can learn and hopefully make a little $ in the meantime.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 17:13:06'] First, will your broker allow you to sell a naked call? You’ll need to be very well capitalized and fill out lots of paperwork. Second, your potential loss is theoretically infinite. Multiplied by the odds it’s probably not really that bad, but certainly you want to be vigilant of your position. Third. Upside gaps can be a bitch if you’ve sold naked calls.

Sure. Realistically? You'd be assigned the instant that contract was made.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-27 21:27:20'] The risk of selling a naked call is that if amzn goes above 2000 the buyer can exercise that call, which now leaves you with a short stock position of 100 shares per contract.Would that position blow up your account?If you have a bearish bias you could use the sold naked call to enter a bearish wheel strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-26 16:33:53'] You can't sell unless you actually have the 100 shares to gamble.You can only buy calls and puts.The analogy of difference is buying $1 lottery tickets (buying calls / puts) and selling $1 lottery tickets (selling calls / puts.)

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 06:08:26'] Congrats!  Most use the premium for income to help pay bills or pay off debt.  Others build up their account to make more trades and increase their income.Keep in mind that accounts can drop so be prepared for that.  Having too much tied up in any stock does have risk in case that stock tanks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 09:08:01'] I do the same, and I do not have any problem with that. If I have 100 shares and sell 1 CC contract and reach 200 shares, I start selling 2 contracts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 09:40:26'] What's your thesis?Your trading strategy should be tied to a fundamental belief about how the market will move, and if your view is more correct than other traders, in the long run you'll make money.For example selling calls but being long in the stock means "I think this stock will continue to rise, but will do so relatively steadily, it may have some drops, but long run it will continue to rise". Is this what you believe? If so, then great. Continue selling calls and reinvest the premiums in the stock.The reason it's important to have a concrete thesis is because you need to identify when you are winning because your thesis is right, and *most importantly* when you thesis is no longer true, meaning you should exit you position and rethink your thesis.For example if Amazon announced it's shutting down AWS, and the stock drops, if you don't have a thesis you might be inclined to hold a bad position longer hoping it will rise. However if you can see the news and say "darn, I guess what I believed was wrong", you can cash out, probably still a bit ahead (having been right for a while) and re-assess.

Sadly, shortly after, my close friend died at 40 due to covid and it taught me life is short. Now I focus my life to do what I love, and those premiums have allowed me to reduce my stress and find a great work life balance.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 08:22:13'] Yes this is a great long term strategy.  Once you keep getting the profit and keep buying enough assests to where you can make at least 3000 a month than it's time to take 10 percent of portfolio to more aggressive strategy that can really double or triple you portfolio.!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 09:48:30'] I'm currently building positions with the premium from my sold options (and with the money I add monthly).I am researching different stocks in different sectors, when I'm sure I want to own one and I have the capital to get 100 shares, I sell a CSP and then start wheeling if get assigned.With all the premium I get I manage my open options (closing for a profit after a favourable movement for example) and when I have enough cash on my account I open a new CSP on the next stock I want.My endgame will be to have a minimum position of at least 100 share for every stock and sell both a call and a put on each stock. Doing this will double the premium I receive on each stock while also building a bigger position on the stocks I want if they go down.From there research more stocks and check periodically if I want to keep the ones I own.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 17:14:40'] Like any short premium strategy, it works until it doesn't.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 08:22:09'] " I keep selling calls long dated and closing them out for a profit."So let's say you sell to open a call for a year from now, and from now till the next year, you are observing the market and buy to close cheaper than you sold. If I understand your strategy. This strategy works only if market has volatility (goes below your premium) right? Otherwise you will be screwed, am I thinking about this correct? For example, If AMZN after you sold to open, keeps the same or just goes up, so as we get closer to your call execution date, you will bleed more to close. What's your thought on that?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 10:41:19'] Since you have the stock you could use the premium to hedge your position long term.Like instead of just selling a covered call, you sell a straddle for next month, and buy a long put (like 1yr forward expiration) to both cover the straddle low end and also you end up hedging the position by buying the put.If the stock remains sideways you can repeat this and keep buying more puts, so you can be in an overhedge position.If the stock goes up you are covered, if the stock goes down you're also kinda covered by your long put, but it'll be necessary to manage the position.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 12:01:03'] OP - I've noticed that covered calls are not generating as high a premium as they did earlier this year. I had been having a good return selling covered calls too. However sometimes a stock that seemed to be good for selling covered calls - becomes a stock that is ungood - like META.  When closing out covered calls I've been selling those that are no longer high quality or high growth. I sometimes buy more stocks or even bonds.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 20:45:58'] Covered calls premium is a great way to add using free money … what I do is buy solid companies with strong balance sheets that pay a nice premium and sell covered calls on 3/4 of my position … I usually use premium to buy new companies that I don’t own and build a position with those premiums …. If my covered call gets assigned and I want to get my shares back , I sell a put with a delta of 0.50 or above … that way I get my shares back at a lower price that I sold …if that put doesn’t get assigned I do it again and I use that premium to build other positions ….  I also try to own companies that pay dividends because you can always move your $ from one winner to a loser and keep the yield income …  but to do this you need to pick solid companies that have a long track of paying dividends & strong financials

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-10 14:41:13'] I'll try to refrain from injecting my subjectivity until the end, but you have a few choices:1. Close them out now for a loss if you think it's going to tank further. To your benefit, the insane spike in vols recently has probably made your short legs relatively more valuable, meaning that your losses won't be as bad as if AMZN had a slower, orderly decline.2. Roll them out further if you think this is just a temporary decline. You'll have to take on more downside risk to do so, but you'll give yourself some more time for AMZN to recover.3. Hold it if you've got the moxie to do so. Due to the vol observations in #1, you're probably not down as much as you should be, and if the market bounces in the next week and a half, you'll get a better exit at the very least.Personally, if I had the buying power left, I'd be selling more put spreads on AMZN. This selloff is absolutely ludicrous, especially on basically no news. If you're not as strong in your conviction as I am, I'd do #2, or potentially change your strategy by closing the put spreads, and using the freed up buying power to open up pure short vol trades like a strangle or iron condor.I'll admit, having spreads that expire next week is a bit precarious...but then again, you also have to consider the potential outcomes of trades before you make them, and stick to your plan.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-05 11:50:41'] Since the underlying stock price is so high, even a tiny change in IV or greeks will affect the value of the option. All of this is compounded by the fact that you're less than 2 weeks out...if you are OTM, then the value of your option will deteriorate exponentially. Check Black-Scholes formula.

POST_TEXT: b'Someone please explain to my why this is a bad idea, it seems too good to be true. I want to sell a 9/21 or 9/28 iron butterfly for AMZN consisting of a 2040 long put, 2050 short put and short call, and 2060 long call. My plan is to close it early if/when it reaches 2050, which if I\'m not mistaken is the price at which Amazon will reach 1 trillion market cap. As per Robinhood I can sell this iron butterfly for more than $900 credit, which means the max I can lose is less than $100. I know I won\'t get to keep the full $900+ if I close early, and I\'m ok to lose $100 or so if the price doesn\'t go to 2050 before expiration. What\'s the catch here? Is there a high chance I\'ll get assigned on the short put early, since it\'s in the money, and most likely I\'ll just lose the $100? Would I not get filled if I try to close when it\'s around 2050, due to volatility or something else? Would I have to place a limit order ahead of time so I can "catch" it when I\'m profitable, in case it decides to shoo'
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-01 20:35:00'] The odds of Amazon staying in that narrow of a range at expiration are probably less than 1%. The 9-21 straddle says Amazon will likely move 70-80 pts. You're better off selling a big boy iron fly. Like 1975-2050-2125.By the way I have a AMZN 9-21 FLY on 1935-2000-2065 and expecting a 2000 pin not some arbitrary new high point. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-01 21:46:11'] Statistically you're usually going to lose the 100.  That in no was is meant as a call on AMZN.  You might have a good idea there.  But butterflies in general are low prob trades.If you have access to a P+L chart for the trade, notice the bulge line, that's the current profit zone.  Most people shoot for about 50% of the max gain.  There's a much better chance you'll get there.

	COMMENT: ['2018-09-01 23:44:01'] You are not going to make 900 for sure with this trade. Not even half of it. In one trading day the price moves so much. You might perhaps close it for a 5% profit within a week. That’s all you can make. Very low probability trade.
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-02 06:44:40'] Each of your wings are $10 wide. Together the option is $20 wide. As pointed by others, this is a extremely small range. AMZN moves in one day the width of your net wings. That's problematic and probability is low for this to be a successful trade. In the rare situation this does workout, it's likely luck or IV plummets, hovering around short strikes, 2050. And if IV slowly goes down from here on out ; you can close early and win some but that's moot. At the moment AMZN is parabolic (albeit slowly) but that doesn't mean you can't play this or other similar range bound strategies. Design the range bound strategy by debiting further OTM long calls/puts and don't make the short strikes identical; varying them; hence an Iron Condor. Safer. Tradeoff is less money but a win is a winIf you want to be aggressive but with a much higher probability, try TSLA as an Iron Condor. IV is robust. Bulls and Bears always duel against each other but the sloth tends to win most of the time; effectively remaining range bound GL!
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-02 07:31:10'] Hitting 2050 won’t get you anything unless it’s an hour before expiration. Not wide enough. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-09-03 08:35:31'] The catch is low probability of gain. Likelihood of getting a significant gain on a narrow butterfly, a few days from expiration, with an underlying that can move 40 points in a day, not high.But if you bought a 100 point or 200 point wide butterfly, you may be able to get a 10% to 20% gain, before you have to close it, when AMZN surpasses the middle of the Butterfly.Cost of entry will be higher, but probability of a gain, much higher

	COMMENT: ['2018-07-12 16:21:40'] OTM will increase more in percentage terms but ATM or ITM will increase more in dollar terms. Eg an OTM call at $0.01 goes to $0.02, it increased by 100%. But an ATM call that goes from $1 to $1.10 only increased by 10%, but went up by $0.10.In theory you can substitute for example a 50 delta call with two 25 delta calls. But now you have a smaller probability of profit.

	COMMENT: ['2018-07-12 11:08:33'] Without seeing the greeks, I am surprised because the ITM should have had a much higher delta. My guess would be the extrinsic value of the of the 1805 is jacked up due to volatility, and that's the premium increase you're seeing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 23:34:55'] Yes, this is basically first step of The Wheel strategy. This is a strategy I have recently been doing a lot because you can collect good premiums on high volatility and red days. Just make sure you are picking good stocks that you would be happy to own at a price you would be happy to own.If you do end up owning these stocks you can then sell covered calls to again collect premiums and hopefully sell the stock for a profit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-16 16:18:49'] One thing to remember is that by selling options you give up flexibility. If something fundamental changes and the stock tanks, you’re still buying shares at your strike.If the stock falls to your strike tomorrow, you’re sitting on a big unrealized loss on your options compared to the guys who are buying stock at that low price.If the stock rebounds you’ll only break even rather than profiting by buying the dip.

As long you are cash covered and are fine with acquiring stocks at strike, which sounds like you are. Some people don't understand ccp is a valid strat to buy low while collecting premium on vol/theta. The worst outcome as is, is not amzn keeps tanking after exercise, but it bouncing back right before the option goes itm.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-17 05:19:49'] Sort of. I did sell cash secured puts this week while the premiums were very high. I’ve bee burned by this in the past. The secret is to be sure you want to own it at that strike. You may not. The danger is selling options is the instant gratification. You make money right now. It is tempting to take a small amount today, vs a large amount latter. Rolling a losing put is often a bad deal. You get a credit now, but lose even more. Instead of rolling I usually take buy to close if the chart is bad, or take assignment if good. Once assigned it’s easy to set a stop loss, or limit sell. Based on the chart I set a “drop dead” price. Below that price, I close the position no matter the cost.

If and when the price hits 100, you should review all the technical indicators to determine if you think that’s still the best price you want to pay. Patience is key.

	COMMENT: ['2018-06-13 18:22:12'] There’s a lot of math involved in a problem like this.  First, you need to figure out IV until expiry by converting from annualized.  Use that and a simple normal distribution to figure what % time your calls can land profitably. If you think that probability you calculated is TOO HIGH, you should close the position as the option is overvalued.  If you think that probability is TOO LOW, you should hold til expiry as the option is undervalued and you stand to gain from gamma. If this is over your head, buy underlying instead.

You can write the position concisely as -1 AMZN 3250c 8/21. It is also best, in paper trading, to trade realistic positions with realistic amounts of money. But if you actually do have 500k of real cash at your disposal, I withdraw my lecture.Now, to answer your question, you can close the call for a loss if you want to keep your shares. If you are okay with selling the shares and paying a ginormous amount of short term tax (assuming Canada is similar to the US in that respect), just hold and let it expire and your shares will be called away for $3250/share.

And if it was a naked call instead covered call, I would not be able to hold through margin expansion. Still, although it is technically viable to stall assignment as long as you want by roll out, it may end up with a dead position that doesn't make much sense in terms of return on capital

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-15 13:29:12'] Basically both of your contracts would be executed/assigned and youll incur the max loss which is the differenece between the contract strikes. Im not entirely certain how robinhood handles it as i strictly use etrade. If i had to guess i would say you probably dont actually have the capital to handle the assignment but i would hope that the protective long option would essentially cancel it out. I would maybe call robinhood support to confirm exactly whats going to happen. But i believe when settlement comes around youll just be down your max loss.If im right about you not having the capital to handle the temporary assignment then id suggest next time trying this out on a lower value underlying until you have a good handle on how this stuff works. Learn to not be emotionally involved when things dont go the way you hope they do.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-15 14:28:18'] Relax, the ITM options will exercise & assign to effectively cancel each other out and you will have the max loss.Edit: people ask me all the time why not trade weekly options instead of 30 to 45 DTE as I do, this is a great example where there was no time to react to adjust or manage.  Plus, had you opened at the farther out date you likely would have brought in a higher credit to lower your max loss.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-27 23:52:35'] This isn’t a terrible strategy, in general. But it’s riskier than you think. Your question seems to be “Where’s the downside?” or “where’s the risk?” So, here’s where I see risk:1) Far and away the biggest risk is just holding $140k in one single equity. That’s not divested. Earnings tanks the stock, or sentiment drains the stock, and you could lose $15-20k in a day, or more. 2) Since you’re holding the risk of a stock that has high IV, the benefit should be that it’s as likely to go up $15-20k as it is to fall $15-20k. If you sell the call, you’re then selling some of that upside (depending on how far OTM you sell). 3) If IV moves at all, the $1,000 call price might not be a real number. It might be a lot less. Additionally, the further out of the money you go, the less liquid the call is and the more unlikely it is to sell. I haven’t looked at the options charts or anything, but just something to consider. Many times people see an ask of $1,000 and ignore that the bid is $500 and the volume is like 5 contracts which implies it’s not selling well and not at that price. I’m sure there are some other risks, but those are the ones that pop off the page to me. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-28 05:41:45'] Don’t forget that Amazon reports earnings this week, hence why those far OTM calls are going for $1k. You’re better off doing a call spread. Far less risk dollar wise and you can define your max profit/loss which is a necessity in trading. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-01-29 04:39:56'] There is a trading method and style called "wheeling", where you sell a call a good deal closer to at the money, gain more income, and, just in case the stock is called away (which is OK, because you get good gain in your set-up and management), to buy it back, or alternatively, then sell puts, to gain income, and occasionally be put the stock, and start the cycle gain (hence the term wheeling in and out of the stock).   You'll get more income, and since you're willing to risk the  liabilities of owning the stock outright, you're probably willing to commit to this closer-in to at the money pricing on options.  Consider the possibility of selling weekly calls as close as 100 points from at the money, and similarly, selling weekly puts at 100 points from market, when you don't own the stock, and rolling in and out of the stock over time.

	COMMENT: ['2018-01-28 19:16:46'] buy the mar9 1330 call for 109.55 and sell the feb 2 1350C 74.55, close it at 50%, this buys the option at low iv and sell it at the weekly juiced up iv, knowing the iv would dump and wouldn't hurt the mar9 call. these calls would hedge your upside and downside very wide, atleast 200 points wide. it uses far less capital, like only $3,380 and 100 shares are only $70k in a margin account, covered calls use margin on the shares also and the $2000 short call lowers your BP because of the credit received. i brought 10 shares at $940 and still think amzn is speculative, its $1000 over its fair value.
	COMMENT: ['2018-04-03 20:28:54'] It’s been an interesting few weeks since you, the OP, has posted.  I personally know someone who does exactly what you describe in your first post.   She makes annually around a 26% to 30% return. She’s been doing this using the strategy you detailed for close to a decade.  If the stock declines, she dollar cost averages down and continues to write calls.   If it’s a quality stock, eventually things turn around.   I myself am thinking of doing exactly what you were or did. Especially now, since the stock has declined so far so fast.  I figure it’s due to stick its head up above the water and breath for a week or two.   I figure making 3% I the next two weeks in $130k is better than buying a CD.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-07 10:05:35'] A put combined with owning 1 lot (100 shares) of the underlying is just a synthetic call -- equivalent to having the call option and an equal sum of cash.  This action taken on just 50 shares would be the equivalent of 100% leverage.  The disadvantage from selling your holdings and buying a call would be any cost occurred from taxes, but it may be something you want to look into.  If you're going to hedge with puts, take a look at the Delta and gamma of what you're buying.  Delta tells you how much the put option will move with respect to the price of the underlying, and Gamma will tell you how much Delta will move with respect to the price of the underlying. Gamma can be thought of as the first derivative of Delta.Learn the other Greeks while you're at it so you don't get overly burnt on volatility or time decay.

	COMMENT: ['2018-10-07 18:08:25'] I would just buy a further OTM put. It will give you the cheap protection you’re after, which is a decent trade off considering that you’re overhedging (hedging an additional 50 shares). Other strategy someone mentioned is a put spread where you sell a further OTM put to offset the cost. But given that you’re bullish and just want to protect against a black swan event I would just go with the further-than-5% OTM put, it’s simple and will accomplish your objectives.
	COMMENT: ['2018-10-08 05:53:19'] With delta hedging you don't to match the size of the share position to be hedged with the contract position, even for a complete hedge (which would be expensive). You can completely hedge a 50 share AMZN long with 4 contracts of any put with a 0.25 delta. Any you can have a partial hedge with fewer contracts (2 will give you about a 50% hedge).But if you are doing long-term discrete hedges, the traditional delta calculation (Black-Scholes-Merton style) is not very accurate. It is better to use sensitivity analysis to calculate discrete delta

	COMMENT: ['2020-03-05 15:53:35'] I am planning to buy some slightly OTM calls that expire in 12/22 and then sell weekly calls against them. It seems like it would be possible to fully pay for the long calls with the short calls, given that there is such a large discrepancy in theta between them. It seems *too easy*, if anything, so I might be overlooking something.As for your strategy, you will have lower theta decay with a longer dated long option. Buying the shares instead of an option means a large cash outlay and potentially higher margin requirements. Of course, you could just borrow the cash with a box spread, since rates are so low.
	COMMENT: ['2020-03-05 15:44:05'] I’ve thought about doing the same With amazon.  Right now I have been doing something similar with Microsoft (bought pretty deep in the money in January exp June and selling covered calls). The thing to keep in mind is1.  High volatility makes long expiration expensive now2. Consider what the break even price is and if you’d be willing to sell covered calls below your break even.  For me the substantial drop in msft means for me to get reasonable premium on short term options I now have to sell covered calls below breakeven.  I’m down by 25% on the long call and clawed back about 5% so far with the covered calls.Cheers and good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2020-03-05 16:03:06'] It’s going to be hard finding Jan 2020 contracts ... ;)I don’t get how the credit part works, unless you’re just using the long LEAP as collateral for the shorts? It’s kind of like a long leg of a credit spread that you don’t have to roll out, because it already is.
	COMMENT: ['2020-03-05 16:49:09'] There is nothing wrong with this, its called wheel strategy. Here is one such helpful discussion - [wheel](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dto9hq/questions_about_the_wheel_strategy/)
	COMMENT: ['2020-03-05 16:55:30'] Wait for the big big sell off, it hasn’t hit yet, when S&amp;P hits 2800, then go long. IV won’t be as high on that day.
	COMMENT: ['2020-03-05 21:03:52'] Option prices are jacked up really high right now due to market volatility and buying a LEAP puts you at the end of a very long vega lever. If IV collapses, due to a quick rise in price, you’ll miss out on those gains with a LEAP because the vega (long IV) component will work in opposition to your long delta.On the other hand if the price slides and IV contracts (this can happen) you’ll be hit in both directions being long delta and vega.If you can afford 100 shares of AMZN and are comfortable with that position (kudos to you if so), I would look into selling a short put to go long. You can select the price where you’d like to buy it and you immediately collect all the fat premiums. If the stock goes up the put will expire worthless and you can sell another one. If the price breaches your put then you will be assigned the shares at the price you selected and you still get to keep the premium. Then you can sell covered calls against it. This strategy is called “the wheel”. Short puts to buy and covered calls to sell, all the while collecting option premium.You should only do this though if you want to own the shares, aren’t super concerned with short term profits (the market may continue to tank for a while and you will loose money until it rebounds), and don’t mind being a more active trader.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-24 10:59:19'] You'll make more extrinsic premium selling closer to the money.  That comes at the cost of lessening your upside if the stock moves higher.  There's also a higher probability you'll have your shares called away.  If you don't want to give up your shares for tax reasons or whatever, consider that too.If you just want to make a side bet on AMZN going up or down after earnings, you can do it with a vertical spread.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-24 11:02:06'] The answer is your risk tolerance. Do you think the $35 premium will expire worthless? Probably not, it’ll get exercised or you buy it back for whatever the intrinsic value is. Will the cost of it decrease and you buy it back at a $30 or less premium than it beat the other option? $2000 strike expiring worthless more likely so you just collect premium and keep your stock. $1910 break even vs $2005 break even. I’d sell the $2000 strike because in the event of a major run up you still sell your stock at $2000 and collect premium.That said it’s totally feasible for amazon to move 3% to the $1910 breakeven and in my opinion selling a way OOTM strike generally is the best if you desire to keep the stock. Amazon is a keeper stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-25 07:44:33'] My vote is for the higher strike. Not sure why someone with $186,000 worth of underlying is soliciting anonymous opinions though. The median reader here likely has a four figure account size.I do hope the portfolio is many times larger than the 100 shares of AMZN. It is a great company, but even great stocks sometimes tumble. Sometimes they fall and don't get up./Edit, saw the bit about two contracts. Even more curious for a $350k account or higher to be asking beginner questions. Again, most common novice mistakes are trading too big, trading illiquid options, not having a plan. If this trade is all the eggs, that's too big. Liquidity is just okay on these. Please have a plan for up, down, unchanged.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 08:40:04'] First lets talk about why you want to make a change at all. A perfectly sound strategy would be to just continue to hold, or DCA and buy more shares at discounted prices, and wait another 10 years for things to average out. I'm not saying you have to do that, but I am asking why you decided not to. What has changed? Why do you think a pivot is necessary?Those aren't rhetorical questions. The answers are important to understand what the root cause is. Crafting a strategy without understanding what is motivating it is a recipe for making a bad decision/strategy.-------------------For the sake of argument, I'll assume the reason is that you have discovered and gone beyond your risk tolerance. If that's not the reason, ignore the rest of this section.The best thing to do, all things considered, is to rebalance your portfolio to lower its risk profile. That necessarily means selling some of your shares. You can tax manage that somewhat if you can select tax lots individually, but one way or the other, you are going to realize gains/losses and have tax impacts. However, I think you will find that the net net of all those tax impacts will cost you less in the long run than any kind of adventure into options and hedging.You don't have to sell all your shares all at once. You can do a gradual reduction of risk by diversifying. And you can sell some of the losers to cancel out some gains on sales of the winners. You should probably dump all the losers regardless to free up capital for diversification.Now, how to diversify. That depends a lot on your time horizon and investment goals, but the general idea is to move your overweight in Tech towards the broader world-wide equity market, and add bonds and commodities to dilute the concentration of risk correlation in your current portfolio. 60/40 world equities/world bonds is a decent eventual asset mix to shoot for, but use an interactive asset mix calculator to find the mix that fits your goals best. I link a few below and the first link is the one I use myself.For now, you can start slow by selling all your losers and however much of your winners net to zero cap gains after selling the losers, and use the freed up cash to buy VTI. That's only the US equity market, but it's a good place to start. If you want to go 60/40 VTI/BND, that would be fine too. Both are deeply discounted vs. 15 year averages right now, so you'll be getting bargain prices.You can read more about asset class diversification and portfolio asset mix here:https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolioAsset allocation calculators:https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocationhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulationhttps://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculatorhttps://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/overview

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-19 10:21:05'] First off, this isnt a "potential" bear market. It is one. Secondly, the problem with buy and hold "strategies" is that you really have no way to know when to sell...and there is always a time to sell. Paying taxes sucks I know.1.) Tax loss harvesting2.) Use correlations to your advantage. For example, DXY and rates going up clobbers tech, so positions that profit in such an environment are a hedge against your current PF.3.) Short correlated indices using futures or ETFs. SQQQ, SARK,NOPE on the long side or short QQQ, ARKK, GK directly and use the cash to buy short term Tbills.Theres an "Inverse Cramer" ETF coming online next month.Fortunately tech pays shit dividends so its a lot easier to short it and short term rates are high so you have some structural advantage here that we didnt have for a long time.So step one would be harvest as much tax loss as you can and figure out how much gains you can net out. Then overlay the above suggestions to tweak how much beta you want to this market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 17:47:06'] I close at 10% up or down, but if it breaches 10% down in the middle of the day I'll wait until the end of the day to see if it comes back up. If it never hits the 10% I'll wait until the morning of earnings if the call is after market hours. Usually a GTC sell order will fill shortly after open if that's the case.I try not to get into a position where I have to leg out. I want there to be enough volume and open interest that I can close it quickly. Sometimes the pricing will jump around and if I can get 5% after one or two days then I'll take that so I can move on instead of waiting for the full 10%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 04:55:44'] In the current economic situation and earnings performance, you need to be able to break even or make money if the stock moves less than its average earnings move. Last year, downside surprises were all over the place and stocks were getting hammered and losing 25%+ on earnings misses. Now, that most stocks have some down, there isn’t a lot of downside to go, and earnings at great enough to go up. Exceptions to this were AMZN, META, and TSLA. AMZN had a great run up to earnings and then missed, so selling prior to earnings was the winning strategy.I am usually entering the strategy 5-10 days prior to expiration. If we get a run up prior to earnings either way, I am taking that profit, otherwise I am evaluating the change there enough significant movement to make it profitable because IV crush is real.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-07 17:47:37'] When you buy straddle, your profit comes from the intrisic value it gains from price movement. IV won't save you from theta decay, especially for anything shorter than 10dte. Feel free to close out the leg that gives you profit equaling to the cost of both option + some. Then you hope it swings to the other side to pick up more profit. However it would be fine if it doesn't swing, because you already made a profit on this trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 10:23:33'] As earnings nears, a straddle's IV should increase, offsetting some amount of the theta decay.    Holding through the EA requires strong conviction since IV contraction will hammer the straddle's value.    Use a combo order to open and close multi-leg positions.  You'll get better fills.  Leg out only if you have a good reason to do so (such as one leg very profitable and the other isn't worth much).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 11:16:21'] I've seen this a few times lately on the flow where some really huge money has been buying deep ITM puts (or calls at times). However, it doesn't seem to have the same affect on the market in the short term as OTM options. These all have near term expirations on 1/20 so it would be assumed that they are looking for some movement in the near future. However in the last 30 minutes since these the stocks and SPY/ES has done nothing but go up. They are clearly opening orders since they are all above OI and institutional. I understand that using the deep ITM strategy allows for directional plays with less capital and takes theta decay mostly out of the picture, but the market doesn't move with them at all every time I see them. I'm struggling to understand the directional bias of Deep ITM puts apparently. Can someone help explain?

For instance, TD Ameritrade automatically exercises anything $0.01 ITM, unless you tell them not to. From their FAQ: "all US-listed options that are $0.01 in-the-money, based on the "composite" or "consolidated" closing or last sale price reported by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) price vendors for underlying security prices on the final trading day prior to options expiration, will be automatically exercised"

If you didn't have the cash in your account, your broker will likely have 'lent' you the funds in your margin account.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi all,\n\nI sold an AMZN 2-week iron condor last week with the call-side strikes at 2000 / 2020 (put sides were at 1880 / 1860). It's currently trading at 2030 and doesn't expire until next week so I'm wondering how to approach managing this.\n\nI was just considering selling put spreads at 2000 / 1990 to try to eke out some profit if the condor doesn't return to profitability (I didn't want to sell any higher so I wouldn't be betting against myself, but maybe that's not the right way to think about it?). Are there other strategies I should consider? I'm not too far from running into capital requirements in this account, too (AMZN's share price doesn't help these matters) so that's a consideration, as well. I guess I can also just close the positions, take my losses, and look for the next trade.\n\nAppreciate any insight, including just links to any articles that might address this scenario. Thanks, all!"
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-11 08:39:42'] It is a typical move to create an iron butterfly, in the move you propose.  Often, traders will simultaneously create the iron butterfly, and roll the trade out in time, in hopes of catching a down move at some point in the future, after more than one roll out in time.   A balanced trade would result in 2000 / 2020 call side and put side 2000 / 1980  (20 points on each side).  You might find that you don't get much of a credit with 2000 / 1990, as you propose. Or you could roll the entire iron condor out in time, at the same location it presently is.  This has a smaller credit, or more likely a debit, but creates a larger future target, for when the underlying swings by in price. Sometimes it is possible, for a credit, to move the whole position upward a strike, while rolling out it time. Play with the possibilities with your broker platform. I have met up with traders that successfully rolled a challenged trade, a number of times, for a credit each time, for as long as six months, and had the underlying swing by in price, and exit for a substantial gain, and reduced the loss each time with the credit for each rollout. Generally, it's best to do this sooner rather than later. **For any of these positional moves, do this for a net credit**: this pays for the capital, and reduces the risk by reducing the net loss from the potential maximum loss over the series of trades.Or you could take your loss and move on.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-11 12:42:29'] You could make the trade into an iron fly, but it reduces your profit range and you will need to keep the trade alive longer (likely all the way up to the day it expires as AMZN 1day swing is ~$15) before you are profitable again unless if you can predict the swings and close the put/call wing early. I'd not try to defend this trade without more capital, either roll it out to August (you will need to deal with earnings), or close the position and make a new one for next week with a better chance at making money. Could also wait too, there is a good chance there will be some profit taking tomorrow after the large rally this week.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-11 16:07:45'] I would take the position off completely and nick the small loss. You are also at risk of being exercised on the call side.Don't make any adjustments. If you do convert it into a fly, you're still at risk of being exercised on. Although, that's probably the second best defending position to take on after completely closing it out
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-11 17:03:26'] Roll out your call spread to Aug16 and sell an OTM put spread of the same width for a credit to add to the roll if you want to neutralize some delta. Looks like you can roll the credit spread for a credit still, so don’t both turning it into an iron fly as you’d be limiting your probability of success.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-11 22:17:36'] I wish I'd read any of this advice earlier. I ended up overreacting and selling some panicked put spreads expiring tomorrow trying to recoup potential losses. Now I find myself needing AMZN to have a +$15 day (which is obviously possible, but not something you want to bet the bank on).  Thanks for all the responses. I clearly have a great deal to learn around position/risk/capital management.

	COMMENT: ['2017-07-18 13:20:45'] It's never a bad idea to take profits! When you buy an option, you have to get both the direction and the timing right to make money. You got it right - I might take profits and re-establish a new position.But if you want to keep your position on through earnings, let's talk through your scenario.Current position:delta: +68theta: -33vega: +147Basically, you want the price to go up, but you get hurt as time passes, and if IV decreases (which it will most likely do after earnings), you get hurt.If you buy a put, you'll decrease your delta exposure, but you'll actually INCREASE your theta and vega exposure.If you want to hedge, I would rather see you sell a call instead of buying a put since IV rank is fairly high (73) in there right now.For example, if you sold the Aug 18 1070 call, your position will look like this:delta: +38theta: +13vega: +42This reduces your delta exposure by 44%, so a price move (in either direction) has less of an impact on the value of your position. You're still bullish though - you want the price to go up. This actually REVERSES your theta - you're EARNING money over time rather than losing it. And it reduces your vega exposure by 74%, meaning if (when) you see a decrease in IV it will hurt you less than it would with just the long call.Nobody has a crystal ball, so nobody is going to be able to tell you what approach is going to be better. This is just an idea.If I were you, I'd take profits. If you want to play earnings in there, wait until the trading day just before earnings and put on a new position at that time, selling premium to take advantage of IV crush that earnings brings.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello guys, \n\nI have been investing for a couple months now and trying to come up with a relatively low risk covered call strategy. This is what I have come up with and I would like to hear your thoughts: \nSell slightly in the money call on AMZN two weeks out, this typically pays a $40 premium. Buy a put $40 below call strike price which costs around $5. The goal is to hold for one week and based on my calculations this strategy produces a fairly flat profit with limited loss risk. If the underlying goes up $50 this produces a $2000 profit in one week and if it drops $50 or even more the loss is capped at around $1500. If underlying goes sideways and stays fairly flat this strategy pays around $1000. Obviously executing this strategy needs a big chunk of upfront money. But aside of that, do you guys see any other issues with this?'
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-20 16:47:08'] If your selling a naked ITM call and the underlying goes up $50, you lose $5000. I see no purpose for the put 40$ OTM. This strategy means your bearish on AMZN for the next 2 weeks, which I would highly advise against.Your losses are not capped at 1500 with this strategy, your losses could be very high ($10000 loss would not surprise me as AMZN usually moves at least 20-30$ everyday). In a calm market where underlying is 1-2$ below call strike at expiration you win $3500 (4000 premium - 500 for worthless put).
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-20 18:16:43'] I vote thumbs down. AMZN can be a volatile stock. Liquidity may not be there when you need it. Unless 100 shares of AMZN is less than 7 percent of your account, I suggest a lower priced underlying. Rookie mistake number one is trading to big. AMZN is big.If you insist, consider the put credit spread. One less leg, same risk reward. So sell the put at the strike you would sell the call, no stock, buy protective put at lower strike.Your numbers do not match what I see. A $5 put for June 28 is 70 points otm. Stock 1918, 1845 put is bid over $5. $35 call is strike 1900. So the risk is $55-$12 or $4300. Max profit is $1200. If market is efficient, you have about a 75 percent chance of winning, but max loss is triple max profit.Maybe paper trade it using market orders, see how it does. But again, unless 100 AMZN shares is a small trade for you, a lower priced underlying is a better place to learn. Especially for RH clients, because they might close legs to protect themselves, without warning.
	COMMENT: ['2019-06-20 15:20:59'] It doesn't sounds like you are running a covered call.

	COMMENT: ['2019-06-21 09:18:33'] The numbers seem a little out of whack here but my .02 cents - I do this frequently with amazon to generate income (on both sides short calls and cash covered short puts depending on what I think is happening) and have done very well. It absolutely can work, that said I only do this with decently OTM options to give myself room. I don’t mind so much getting assigned a short put because I believe in amazon long term but what would be terrible is having the stock run up 100 points and capping my gain at where-ever the previously ATM call was. I’d suggest taking the reduction in premium and selling slightly OTM and also do not be afraid to close out a trade that’s going well. Last week I wrote calls around 10:30 and by 3pm I was up 40 ish percent. I know that’s below what most people would consider closing out but I’d rather take the guaranteed quick win and play again tomorrow than deal with the insane uncertainty that is the current stock market/economy/amazon

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-28 08:29:38'] My suggestion to you is to play carefully and set your profit loss targets tight. Just keep in mind that many blue chip companies utilize revolving debt to fund and finance investment or reinvestment into the company regardless of how much cash they have on hand. With rates looking like they will not let off, blue chips (along with every other company that uses leverage) have to find more ROI with the leverage they have but unfortunately a lot of them have optimized operation around cheap money for nearly a decade. We might see some level of rebound tomorrow and in the coming weeks but unless a miracle drops out of the sky we’re looking at an FED strategic slowdown and breakdown of asset prices across all categories that have seen large percentages of appreciation. My plays currently are Spy puts with about 10% of my portfolio in short/medium term and long expiries. The rest of the 90 is all cash and ready to deploy.If you look at housing purchase data, we’re seeing a massive drop of origination rates for new home purchases indicating that consumers are starting to slow down. On the residential side we’re seeing the slowdown of new money. This can broadly be applied to all loan origination (auto loans, personal loans etc…) In the near to mid term, there will be less and less money being created and circulating to sustain our current asset prices. Basically the loans are starting to dry up that keep asset prices elevated. This is what we’re starting to see with a lot of the earnings lately. Purchasing is slowing down and cost to operate is increasing thus shrinking to non existent profits… On the long term side I have a hunch that due to the worsening environmental impacts were are witnessing around the world, a systematic slowdown of consumption to drastically slowdown spending to environmentally sustainable levels is on the radar. Whatever happens in between these points is the big ?

But the truth is they are subject to the sentiment of market participants not to mention the rest of their portfolios…If I bought GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT and I’m getting margin called, I’m selling those stocks that have retained their value to cover my losses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-28 23:22:47'] Blue chip companies sell off...Future expectations changed from rate hike will soon slow down(1st quarter next year) to may be more aggressive. More rate hike, economy goes down, spending goes down, borrowing cost sky rocket, blue chip companies will cut more employees and borrow less due to increased cost. So yeah, blue chip companies sell off for sure.September calls seems to be a bit early/risky. They may be making money, but when consumers have less money to spend, EVERYTHING will drop. I recall back in around 2008 ish ? Apple released iphone 4 and the sales from that quarter exceeds the annual combined sales from previous year. Yet, stock price dropped from 180ish to around 90. When markets going down, don't try to time the lows, especially with only one sided options. Big picture: fed is furthering their rate hikes - translates into crappy economy. Government going full out with tapering - also translates into crappy economy. This ain't math, two negatives does not make positive. A lot of macroeconomics that you can look at which indicates there's gonna be shittier times. (Ex. Ultra low oil inventories, high gas price, tons of natural disasters that impacts crops, rising layoffs at bluechips,  ...the list goes on.). Having that said, I think it's still risky for such early calls but who knows, maybe it'll work out.

When Amazon was at \\~87 I was in the dilemma and sold PUTs for 85 SP for a good premium on 11/09 expiring that week. I was worried it may go down as everyone else as midterm results and inflation were unknown. Next day, good news coupled with AMZN cost cutting strategy propelled it 13%. I am happy that my 3 PUT contracts expired worth less but if I would have bought the stock than options, more money could have been made.\n\nHow do you guys decide or think this will be the lowest price for any stock and buy the stock outright rather than selling options. Technical charts also not working these days with so much volatility. TIA!'

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 13:13:31'] When working the Wheel, meaning crowding that short put strike less conservatively, price movement up really doesn’t matter to me.  If the underlying price goes up on anything above 7-10dte, the option is going to offer you some money to leave.  A radical rise allows you to leave and keep a big chunk of the premium.  Whatever the BTC let’s you keep, figure out how many shares that’ll get you at the original intended strike price when subtracted from the new underlying price, 5 shares, 15 shares, whatever, and buy them.  Then you look at the underlying again, evaluate, and either sell another put with a higher strike or wait a bit for it to settle back into the zone it’s found comfortable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 15:54:10'] Keep selling the premium. Would you have sold the shares that day if you would have bought them? Probably not, using hyperbole in the market causes emotions to react, which will ultimately cause of catastrophic loss.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-20 16:47:33'] I’m currently in a similar situation. I’ll describe my situation and allow you or others to take what you will from it (probably nothing) Anyways, I own 1800 shares of WBD at $14 and Im confident I’ll look back wishing I had bought more. Problem is that I’m down to my last 5k cash avail. I decided I want to wheel options until I feel the stock is ready to breakout in an upward trend at which point I’d use the earnings to outright buy the stock….so I decided to sell 4 of the 11.5 put options with 30-45 days til expiry. This is my first time selling puts. I’m very bullish on this stock so I was scared to employ a new strategy initially. I’m glad I did though because I’m learning a lot. Just 2 hours later I saw an article in the news tab announcing there was unusual options activity. Someone sold $5,294,036 worth of puts. I took a screenshot of the article and sent it to my dad cause it was reassuring to know I wasn’t alone in deploying this strategy. I had told him what I wanted to do with the put selling weeks before all this happened and how I was just scared to try it even though I understood everything. I played the what if I lose all my shit and then some because I misunderstood the risk or premise of the strategy itself. Like I could’ve bought straight shares like my dad did and now I have a tiny bit of fear about it. My dad only has one strategy, buy low and sell high and it’s gotten us in some sticky situations so I’m constantly looking for ways to mitigate risk and one up him. Hope my though process can show that you’re not alone in that fear and what if crap. I think it really comes down to the timeframe and how badly you want to own the stock. If you think this is advice then don’t take it cause it wasn’t. Simply laying out some discussion material about my thoughts when I do the same thing.Edit: this is basically me venting

You might be able to get away with your strategy until the next earnings report assuming no bad market news, but I wouldn't go through earnings. Look what happened to NFLX. Granted AMZN is also trading at 4 x revenue vs 17 for NFLX and they are very different businesses. Take my warning for what you will. If earning don't stay up I think AMZN will take a dive.

To do it now probably means adding more capital. I wouldn't throw good money down this rat hole loser. Clear your head and regroup. Have a plan next time, besides, "I'm gonna be right and make $xx dollars," and ask Reddit when I lose. Two day trades are crap shoots, you rolled craps. You played, you loss.

You need to give yourself time to be right.Right now, the trade is a full loser and there's nothing you can do.  It isn't rollable right now and you'd need the stock to drop four or five dollars for it to become so.  I hate to say it, but you're stuck praying for a down move tomorrow.  As for when to close it, puck your poison.  If it was mine, I'd wait until the close, then close it.One thingt you want to avoid is the stock closing between your two strikes.  If that happens, you be assigned on the short call and come in Monday short 100 shares of stock per spread you sold.  Again if it was mine, I'd do nothing wait wait until the market is about to close to buy it back.
	COMMENT: ['2016-06-03 04:22:37'] Nothing you can do. Stick to 30-55 day time frame. Had this been longer out in time, you would have sold a credit put spread against your credit call spread (I assume that is what you put on).You do not roll spreads, unless it was created as a synthetic naked option. Also, if you are just starting out, you should really stick to shorting volatility on high IVR/IVP products. Goodluck.

	COMMENT: ['2015-07-24 16:46:59'] Thanks for the replies. I'll address them all in one batch. For those that feel compelled to give me advice, I sell naked all the time, and leg in all the time. Most of the time it works, but sometimes high probability trades blow up.Yes, risky. I think I was emboldened after my selling of GPRO strangles before earnings worked so well. Sometimes the market has to teach people a lesson. It was my turn today. I'm sure many other premium sellers got blown out of the water on AMZN, either before or after the news, but haven't reported it publicly. When markets move fast, it makes it that much harder to get in or out of positions, and spread orders can be twice as hard. If a person is unwilling to take the max loss on a spread and is forced out on a spread, taking market fills on both ends of a fast moving market can make my bad trade look like a spring picnic.As for details, I sold the 540 puts for 50 cents when AMZN was at 567 and the 590 calls for 32 cents @559. The calls expired for a win, but the losing leg was covered at $3.65 @539. So no, it was not close to break even, with 82 cents of credit against $3.65 to cover. I wasn't too concerned about buying power, because it was a one day trade. It was going to work, and I'd get my buying power back, or I was going to get out. AMZN closed at $529.42, so had I held on until the last minute of trading, covering might have cost $10+, perhaps a full $11 with a market order to avoid assignment.Spreads have their own problems. I believe that in this case, most of the common spreads would have made the out come worse not better. It would have added another level of bid/ask spreads and commissions and not offered any real protection against what happened. The loss on my trade was less than $3 per unit. A three dollar wide spread on AMZN in a fast moving market is unlikely to be worth doing for retail traders. Someone did one $2.50 wide before earnings, but that was during a calm market time. Ten dollar wide, sometimes more, is common on a $500+ underlying, so max loss $10, plus another level of commissions and bid/ask friction.Unless a person is willing to take a max loss on the spread getting out in a fast market on expiration day is like walking through a mine field. Using spreads vs. selling naked, can help in case of a big gap, but the news was out and today was expiration day. I rightly thought the gaps were over. Unfortunately it was a trending move down during the last couple of hours. Trending moves are the enemy of most premium sellers.
	COMMENT: ['2015-07-24 18:41:32'] I lost a lot on a PM account and even though its PM I was pretty pissed off about it. From my point of view I'm done with the high fliers that aren't tied to fundamentals i.e. Amazon, Tesla, and Netflix. Those stocks could soar on just about anything so I'm sticking to OTM put spreads with plenty of days to manage it. And they need to be spread so you don't get caught when the market realizes $570 dollars on a stock that makes 25 cents per share isnt worth it. On this earnings play you just can't get far enough OTM on the call side to make the premium worth it IMO. Maybe with a longer duration you could manage it and roll it into a winner but with an earnings play like this you have no duration so its so risky, at least that's my takeaway from this week. 
	COMMENT: ['2015-07-24 15:22:20'] Can you post what you originally sold the 540 for and what it was when you bought it back? Since you won on the 590 your total loss should have been little no?
	COMMENT: ['2015-07-24 20:13:26'] Man, sorry to hear that.. I've heard the good and the bad with AMZN. I'm just getting into options, but a coworker of mine came up 300%, and another ended up losing all of his money. Like you said, you will live to trade again! I did pretty good on a Biogen trade. My friend did a write up about it on bloptions.com.
	COMMENT: ['2015-07-24 21:32:23'] I appreciate the candor. I had July 31 long 550/560 call spreads pre-earnings - on the open, I closed them all for a nice gain. Underlying was still at 570ish. *but fallingI flirted with the idea of waiting to close, hoping Amazon would slowly retrace a little below 560 so that my higher strike would set up to (potentially) expire worthless next week. Boy am I glad I thought better of it. Shocked how quickly Amazon got kneecapped today. Glad I got out with profits as my positions would be worthless had I not sold on open. 
	COMMENT: ['2015-07-25 04:40:16'] You were doomed when you decided to Strangle a stock like AMZN. 
	COMMENT: ['2015-07-24 14:46:24'] Yeah that was quite risky, I think if it were me I would have tried selling a vertical put spread instead, at least then you can control how much you're willing to lose.
	COMMENT: ['2015-07-24 15:28:50'] When you open or close a short strangle position by legging, you're not really doing strangles anymore. Strangles benefits from contraction in implied volatility or the time decay. When you leg, sometimes you get lucky and make more money and sometimes you get unlucky and lose more money.That's why I never leg in or leg out when trading strangles. You should have used verticals if you wanted to play with AMZN directionally. Those naked short options use a lot of buying power.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:22:22'] er i think you are mistaken... you can only "sell to close" or "buy to close" on open positions.you can:  sell to open AMZN $100 Strike, 21 DTE  buy to close AMZN $100 Strike, 21 DTE  or  buy to OPEN AMZN $80 Strike, 21 DTE ( same DTE)  sell to CLOSE AMZN $80 Strike, 21 DTE ( same DTE)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:28:25'] Open = opening a positionClose = to close a position&#x200B;Is that not obvious?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:31:35'] Open = opening a position to create a new one in your account.Close = closing the position to remove the open one from your account.  You can't close a position you did not first open, so you could not "buy to CLOSE AMZN $80 Strike, 21 DTE ( same DTE)" if you did not first open it.Opening two separate positions = having two open positions in your account, each will need to be closed, expire, or be assigned to take them out of your account.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:39:08'] You can't talk about "to open" or "to close" without talking about whether the transaction was a buy or a sell.But, think of this relative to a flat position (that is, your position count is 0). This can be positive or negative. Basically, any balance of contracts that is nonzero is considered an "open" position.Next, consider wether the transaction you're placing brings your position count back to zero, or if it brings you to another count **from** zero.So, using *5 contracts* as an example:- for orders marked "sell to open", your position count will go from 0, to -5 short contracts- for "sell to close", the count goes from +5 long contracts to 0- for "buy to open", the count goes from 0 to +5 long contracts- for "buy to close " the count goes from -5 short contracts to 0For the AMZN example you posted, you didn't say wether they were calls or puts or where the strikes are relative to the underlying, but:The first example order in which you're selling to open and buying to close at the same time looks like a rolling order where you buy to close on the $80 strike ($80 strike count going from -1 to 0)  and sell to open the $100 strike ($100 strike count going from 0 to -1). At the end, you'll only have one open short contract.The second example is more like a vertical spread. You're selling to open the $100 strike ($100 strike count going from 0 to -1) and buying to open the $80 strike ($80 strike count going from 0 to +1). The net result is two open contracts, one short, one long.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 09:41:58'] You can buy to open or sell to open a position, but you can't buy/sell to close unless you have an open position to close. I don't really understand the confusion here. It's pretty self-explanatory. If you buy 1 call on Company X, you have bought to open. If you sell that call later, you have sold to close. If you sell 1 call on Company X without owning any shares (selling a short), you have sold to open. Later, you can buy to close.Open opens a position. Close closes it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:54:18'] I use Tos or Tasty and I do not think these have every been choose-able. You do not choose to open or to close. If you do not have the option then it is an open. If you have the option and you do the opposite then it is a close, even if it it part of some other spread. So if you are not careful you might change a vertical into a short option , unless buying power stopped you.I do remember some firms would not let you leg out of a vertical or IC, you had to close the entire spread, but I cannot remember which.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:13:26'] I’m glad there’s so many nice people in here to give you an answer. I would’ve just told you to stay the fuck away from options lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:01:04'] In example one, you had to already have a put position AMZN $80 strike open in or order to "buy to close." That means you had to have "sell to open" that strike/expiration and it's currently an open position in your account. You wouldn't create a spread with example 1 if you were thinking that's what you're doing in that example. Example 2, would open a spread, because you're "opening" both of those position.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:06:11'] Great, you now have a long and a short put, same symbol.  The difference in outcome depends on what happens with the underlying stock price.  Manage both or manage one out.  How largely depends on when and where (stock price) you got into both.  Don’t make that move again unless it’s intentional.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:17:18'] Some brokers like IBKR don’t use such terminology. You simply buy or sell something, just like trading stocks (buying or selling shares), and there is no such thing as “to open” or “to close”. However, TDA, TW and maybe some others use those terms to help you understand that you either are creating/opening a new position, or closing/exiting a position. While mixing them simply means you’re closing/exiting one position while creating/opening a new one. It’s just a concept related to your positions/portfolio, more than specific type of trade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 11:51:34'] Option 2 is fine broker would not have let you do Option 1 because as stated you can only buy to close an existing position.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 12:53:48'] Interactive Brokers doesn’t have any of that “to open” or “to close” nonsense. You buy or sell. If you don’t already have one and you sell, you are now short. If you have some and you sell, you now have less. You know, it makes sense in line with adding and subtracting.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 13:05:57'] Ameritrade has "buy to open" "buy to close" "sell to open" "sell to close" as the 4 choices in it's dropdown.I'm not really sure what happens if you choose the "wrong" one, maybe it doesn't make a difference or maybe it adds an extra warning? Like when you've got linked accounts and you try to trade in the "wrong" account. I'm not really sure.EDIT: I played around with it a little (I didn't submit the trades) but the only difference in the interface is it adds an option to choose your Tax Lot method when you choose "to close".
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 13:11:25'] The opposite of how you start - If you are long ( buying) you buy to open and sell to close If you are short ( selling) you sell to open and buy to close
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 13:16:15'] Uh, it looks like you opened a bull put spread, which is a credit spread. So you are bullish on Amazon and would like to profit in a rise in value.If AMZN closes between $100 and $80, you will be on the hook for 100 shares of AMZN at Market @ expiration. You’ve used the $80 strike to hedge your lack of shares
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 13:57:07'] Buying or selling to open simply means you’re opening a position in the market.  Imagine you and I are the only options traders on earth.  If I want to sell either a call or put, I create a contract out of thin air and price it. You then buy the other side and we’ve opened a position together.  Since options are contracts and not equity, once we agree to close the position, those options do not exist any more. They’re gone. It’s like we’ve torn up the contract between us, hence “closed”.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:25:44'] The answer is they are the same from all practical purposes. The second one will just show up differently for 3 days until settlement. The difference being that instead of zero 80 strike options in your portfolio (your expectation), you'll see an open long 80 and a open short 80. Again, that will just be temporary.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 10:43:10'] Example 1. You sold a put and then to close it by buying the put. You have no open positions.Example 2. You sold a put and then you bought another put. So you have 2 open position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 16:21:54'] To open is To start ... To close is To end.... Say u have only cash .. u can sell or buy  to open but u can only open. .  u can't go from all cash and close to start. That doesn't make sense .  You buy/sell to Open and then close it  And whatever u did first, between buy and sell. U have to do the opposite or wait until experation to close it.   . So if u sell to Open, you have to buy to close, and vice versa, unless it makes sense to just let it expire worthless or it and exercise or whatever situation that would give. U can use a website called optionsprofitcalculator.com to get an idea of what contracts do at different price points. But it's an estimate. It's not 100% accurate. But kinda close
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 21:56:41'] Long and Short simply refer to order of buying vs. selling. If you're long you buy first (to open) and sell last (to close). If you're short you sell first (to open) and buy last (to close). &#x200B;open = start the trade.close = complete the trade.&#x200B;When you have an option spread, (vertical, calendar, or otherwise), in order to close out your trade, you have to sell to close your long option and buy to close your short option.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-15 22:43:09'] Open = enter a position. Close = exit a position. A position can be long or short: if it is long, you enter buying and exit selling, if it is short, you enter selling and exit buying.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 19:52:42'] That’s literally the point of selling covered calls. You’re selling potential upside for income and some downside protection. If you’re fine selling your shares at $93, then keep selling the calls. Like you said, the worst that’ll happen is that you get the shares called away and keep the premiums in the meantime. On the other hand, if you’re going to be kicking yourself or buying back in higher if Amazon goes to $115 and you sold for $93, then covered calls are less desirable. Aside from that, the risk of covered calls is the same as the risk of owning the shares outright. They could see a 30% decline, and the calls will maybe save you 5% of that. Either you’ll end up selling calls that are below your cost basis, or you’ll end up selling calls above your cost basis that are basically worth nothing. If Amazon goes to $75, those 93 calls aren’t gonna be worth much. Other than that, pretty low risk play. Ps, if you sell the 93 calls for $5, the break even on that is $98, not $103 :)

If you’re assigned, use that cash to secure pits and keep making money off it even if it keeps going up. If it goes down, you get the shares back and sell more calls. The Wheel in the Sky Keeps on Turning.

XSP and SPY are similar in size, SPX is 10x XSP. If you’re trading XSP the bid/ask can be wide so plan on closing out trades manually at the midpoint.If you’re looking for the futures market instead for options best to start small with MES as it’s as liquid as SPY.  I never found 0DTE with futures very profitable strategy wise.  SPY works best in a tax deferred account like an IRA rather than a cash account.  I tend to trade section 1256 eligible options in my cash account with margin.  The slippage on XSP does add up but the 60/40 tax structure makes up for it.

In the past I've not had an issue."
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 13:08:00'] Fidelity probably won’t group your two positions because the expirations are so far apart. Another possible issue might be if you have one position in type cash, it won’t group it with anything in type margin. They are a pain in the ass this way, in addition to be stingy with margin requirements.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 13:12:19'] Are you approved to trade spreads?  Apparently this is Level 3 on Fidelity.  (Presumably you are if you are saying you have opened this kind of position before, but people often give erroneous information so I always ask.)Are you sure you don't already have an open short AMZN call?  Are you sure you don't currently have an open order to sell the long call you have?  Are you sure you don't currently have another open order to sell a short call?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-05 13:55:03'] Is the long call held in the margin portion of your account? If it’s in the cash portion, the platform won’t recognize it as a spread.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 21:30:25'] Make sure your account is approved for Tier 2 options. The long option needs to be held in margin. The short leg also needs to be in your margin account. If your long option is cash, call up customer service and they can switch it over. I went through this recently, and those were the things I needed to get things working. Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2017-02-01 21:07:02'] For Feb 3 expiration $890 Calls, I'm seeing 75% Implied Volatility, 25% seems incredibly low for AMZN even if earnings weren't coming up.For standard expiration $890 Calls (Feb 17), I'm seeing 35% IV. What your friend is describing is a volatility crush. When binary events (like fed announments, earnings etc) juice up implied volatility, making options significantly more expensive. Once the binary event is known to be positive/negative, implied volatility 'crushes' which deflates much of the value of your options.If you bought the Feb 3 $890 calls, your breakeven would be $892.50 (strike price ($890) + premium paid ($2.50) = $892.50That's a pretty sizeable move to breakeven. Doesn't mean it can't happen. AMZN has made some pretty wild swings post-earnings but the odds are against you.

	COMMENT: ['2017-06-02 13:22:20'] ATM options on expiration day behave funny. retail platforms don't often display them correctly. If you bought at strike price 1002.5 and you paid 1.90 for the contract your breakeven is 1004.4 on the stock. I show AMZN closing at 1006.7, grossing you about $230. Lastly, as it is a paper account (and even more specifically since it is OptionsHouse, a broker I have personal experience with) I can tell you that their price quotes are generally pretty incorrect in real-time. AI don't see anywhere in your screenshot where it says "equity delayed quotes" when you only have a paper acc with them - do you have a funded account with them? It may be that you're getting real time quotes and the quotes from the paper trade side are still being calculated with a 30 minute delay. In your paper account wait until tomorrow to get assigned the shares. Academically speaking the math is never wrong and is easy to calculate for yourself - in this rare instance you are right and the computer is wrong. EDIT: just checked TastyWorks - that exact call closed with a bid/ask of 2.50/4.50 - I would imagine the fill price if you had closed this afternoon to be around 2.5 if you had really bought that option in real life and held to expiry.

Only reason I did that was the nasdaq sell off after 130pm meant, to me, that tempers cooled a bit, far entered the playing area, and even on subpar earnings amzn probably wouldnt drop more than another 25-35 points. Worst case I'd take possession and sell calls against it.  I closed at 75% gain this afternoon, and was amused to see Amazon close at 1020.04.

Seems counter to the point of ownership. You're capping upside while taking on all that downside risk, and there's A LOT of it. It's not a sustainable strategy on stocks like this (and TSLA etc...). Why not put that capital into something more stable and one that also pays dividends like MSFT and others? Seems to me wild ride stocks + covered calls is pointless.

I guess the other questions to ask are:- What's your basis for the stock?- What did you sell your 850 call at?- Are you ok with it getting called away if AMZN goes 850+  (I didn't look but isn't the recent high like 847?)- What's the expected move after earnings (based on the straddle)?IMO, why take the loss on the call now when AMZN might only go up a little (or in your case stay under 850) in which case you keep the stock and the premium on the call option.EDIT:  Formatting

	COMMENT: ['2014-10-21 16:54:24'] Well, I am bearish on AMZN as a hedge to my long SPY position. Anyways, what I did was buying a put spread and selling a put for even.

	COMMENT: ['2014-10-23 11:01:49'] Pandora's competition is superior to it and growing. On the other hand Amazon is there with Google as companies I won't bet against because they're the two big internet companies that are on the edge technology-wise and have the most talent. I don't think Amazon can grow their main business enough for that valuation but they might make new discoveries and find new places to grow a ton or reduce costs. Maybe my reverance towards them is a good reason to get puts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:16:18'] You have the gist of it.I am long some products, neutral some products, short some products in various underlyings including ETFs.End result is a delta +/- 25% of my total theta for the account.It's ok to have a bias in an underlying. For instance I am mostly long delta in individual companies, and short in some broad market ETFs.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:22:12'] Needed this thread for my simple brain. Thanks OP
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 08:02:23'] Delta is the directional exposure to the underlying. Managing delta implies managing directional risk. Note that just because you are delta neutral, say by selling calls and puts, does not mean you eliminate all risks. You still have gamma and other risks. Take your example of having sold amazon puts. If you sold calls also, you might balance the delta in a static state, but not if the volatility or price change. If price goes way low, the premium from short call is insufficient to cover the loss.  If price goes way up, you are also exposed to loss from the short call (which you would otherwise not have had).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 05:33:42'] You can do all the variants you described (sell calls on the same underlying or beta weight), but most commonly delta hedging is done using shares of the underlying stock, for example by selling 30 shares, so that you can frequently adjust the number of shares and stay neutral while otherwise the delta would be changing.. Some firms adjust their delta/shares every few minutes, others daily. A better example would be buying a wide call spread during high IV spike, then sell shares against that spread and wait for IV to drop or wait for the time to pass. Other times at high IV you may sell a call and buy corresponding number of shares. At low IV you could buy a straddle and neutralize it further with shares, wait for IV to spike, in which case delta hedging will result in gamma scalping (collecting profit from higher vol). While mainly delta hedging is a form of harvesting alpha (profit) while neutralizing beta (correlation to the underlying). Let’s say someone tells you that they can make 20%/year more than holding the stock, by using the wheel or some other way of collecting theta or any other strategy. So then you’d ask them why aren’t they delta hedging to eliminate their risk thus collecting pure 20% profit without depending on the underlying stock. (the answer is that they have no clue what they’re doing and they can’t beat the underlying because they rely on it by not delta hedging and thus their P&L moving proportionally to the delta, which is highly correlated to the underlying).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 06:20:33'] You’ve got it for the most part. One distinction is that buying shares is static hedging, whereas hedging with an options position is dynamic hedging (as the deltas change).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:51:38'] For me, I often have a target delta in mind when getting in. As the underlying moves, any delta from options may change. I may go in and want to be near delta neutral, or net long, or net short. To give an example, say I do a covered call on Apple. In the example, I buy 100 shares and sell a 20 delta call one month out. This initial position is equivalent to being long 80 shares. If Apple stock goes down, the delta on the out of the money call goes down. I might roll the call down and out to stay near the initial 80 delta. If instead, Apple rallies I might roll the sold call out and up to maintain roughly 80 delta. Micro adjustments tend to be counter productive for retail traders. Overall delta on different underlyings tends to be best calculated with SPY beta weight. Thinkorswim provides this number. In essence it takes a snapshot of the entire portfolio and equates it to a number of SPY shares, net long or short or perhaps near neutral. The beta weight gives a rough idea of risk. If trading very short term options, gamma risk can be significant. Gamma measures the change in delta. The rabbit hole can get quite deep. It takes an average person about 1000 hours and a year to get to apprentice level. That’s a mix of study and tiny live trading.  Of course some do it much quicker, but some are also slower.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 12:37:54'] you can only directly add deltas within one ticker.you can't add deltas because AAPL is a different stock price than meta and amzn. The way to do this is a beta-weighted, dollar-weighted delta.that's:β = correlation between your stock and an index (QQQ and SPY are common). correlation is between -1 and 1dollar-weighted: just multiply by the stock price.so if you have a 30d AAPL option, its QQQ delta is:Δ * β * $ = 0.3 * 0.87 * 160 = $41 of riskThis means that -- for each $ that QQQ goes up or down, you have roughly $41 of PnLRepeat the same calculation for AMZN and META to get your total tech exposure
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 07:36:04'] Yes having control of something is very important. You can't really manage the underlying itself or stock market. You get your control or management from options. Like a 401 k you can't really manage that. I say if you are going to invest in an assest (most of you are trading inventory) you will need management of the assest to make you money. It's funny most people are here to give up control (management)for someone else to plan your retirement for you which is a huge mistake.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-02 09:03:58'] If you are trying to exploit something *other* than price direction, like you don't want your option position to change value just because the underlying went up or down in price, you have to manage delta (or gamma) to achieve that.For example, if you are exploiting theta decay, you might want to manage delta so that price movement doesn't get in the way of your collecting that sweet decay credit. If you've got $3.00 of credit coming to you but the underlying makes you lose $4.00 through delta, you are going to cry.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-03 01:04:54'] Probably more of Beta weighted Delta than just delta.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-04 03:32:57'] So many "experts" on here, none of which are answering the questions OP asked, which implies that 99% of the forum full with clueless "traders" who have not read up on a basic like delta hedging.First, forget about TT and the losers Sosnoff and whatever else on there. They are perpetually short the market, and none of them show actual P/L, because they are losers. Sosnoff has been nearly bankrupt several times an lucked out by selling TOS to TDA. As a trader, he made money as market makers when "a train could drive through the spreads" in other words, when they bought near the bid and sold near the ask all day long. This was the coked up 80s, and that time s long gone.Now onto your questions...First, you need to learn about delta hedging by reading books and some online material. Even a single google search reveals what this means https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_neutral - you are trying to achieve zero delta on the portfolio, whether on a single underlyer or multiple underlyings."For example, if I sell a 30d put on AAPL, I'll be long 30d. And if I do that for another 2 stocks for eg, META & AMZN, I'll be long 90d in total."Correct. You need to sum all deltas, including the shares you own (100 shares are 100 delta), to get to total delta."Now in order to "manage delta" does that mean I should sell some calls as well to make it delta neutral? When I sell the calls, should I sell against the same underlyings as my long delta or can I just use beta weighted delta against spy to hedge the delta?"You can sell calls with a total of 90 delta, or sell 90 shares of stock. This is where it gets interesting. You can sell 30 shares of each of the 3 stocks you sold puts on, or you can calculate the correlation of the stocks you sold, and or the correlation to the index that is most representative (SPY, or even QQQ) and then sell the deltas according to that correlation calculation. If the correlation is near 1 among all your choices, then you can either sell calls with a total of 90 delta, or 90 shares of your mix of stocks or index."Also, the reason for this I presume is to not be directional and let theta do it's work?"The reason for this is to decrease directional exposure. Theta has nothing to do with it.Delta hedging works in both ways - start with a underlying position, then use options to neutralize delta, OR start with options and then use the underying and/or other options to neutralize total delta.For instance, you can start with long shares, and then sell covered calls in a delta neutral manner. Like, you own 100 shares of SPY, and then sell 1 ATM call, which carries a negative 50 delta, so you are now at 50 delta, vs. earlier 100 delta.Again, study. Forget what I wrote, and find it in books, with better explanations and examples by good selling authors. The forums are full of idiots who think they can get rich with GME calls, so read everything here with a grain of salt.Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-05 05:49:27'] Part of managing delta is opening new positions such as selling some calls to be mostly delta neutral as you suggested.Another aspect of managing delta is adjusting positions as needed.  If I sell a 30d AAPL strangle with 45DTE and during the first week it moves to one of my short strikes I may roll the untested strike to adjust (manage) my delta.  Assuming AAPL moves up to my short call now I'm short the 50d call and maybe my short put is now 10d.  To manage this I might roll my short put up to somewhere around 30d so my net delta is 20 instead of 40.

	COMMENT: ['2016-05-13 22:28:26'] The main reason is the delta on those options is very low, especially relative to the current option price. Ranging from -0.09 to -0.15 The $630 Put is $2.70x2.90. That means for every dollar AMZN moves, the option increases or decreases by $0.09. That is approximately 3% (0.09/2.90) per dollar move on AMZN.$0.09 X $7 (roughly the amount AMZN dropped today) is $0.63. Those options have a theta of - $0.15, which is roughly the daily time decay.I'm going to assume you bought these on Thursday (or are referencing from this point in time ) so,  $0.15 x 2 = $0.30+$0.63 (DELTA)- $0.30 (THETA)  x  = +$0.33That should explain the reason why the option only gained ~$0.30 when the stock moved in the direction you hoped. The option's Vega may have played into the pricing as well, as the Implied Volatility slightly dropped on AMZN today, which affects prices.As you may now know, option prices are the outcome of many variable factors that are constantly changing. You have to first understand the system, then find the inefficiencies and opportunities to profit. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2016-05-19 00:37:10'] Also, 7 points is hardly an abnormal move for AMZN. It's a mere 1% (roughly).
	COMMENT: ['2016-05-14 08:20:01'] Some good explanations already. One additional point is that on Friday, some of the decay from the weekend gets factored in, so it is almost like three days of theta instead of one day. There hasn't been much weekend market moving news in a while so more of the weekend theta is being shifted to the last half of the day Friday.With Memorial Day coming up, the weekend effect will be even bigger. Liquidity may be a lot less as many leave early for the long weekend.

POST_TEXT: b"I'm usually a premium seller.  I love the tastyworks (40 DTE high, IV) strategy, but I wanted to try something different.  As such, I have a bit of a beginner question regarding debit calls spreads. \n\nIn the hopes to take advantage of the pre ER buzz, last week I went long on a AMZN JUL28 1030/1032.5 debit spread. (Again, I did such a tight spread because it's this is still one of my first weeklys; very stupid move with AMZN.)\n\nWell I guess I was right to go long. Amzn rallied hella hard but shot right through my spread. It's currently sitting at $1,052.80.  That leaves me with a + $12 profit at the moment. I have not been assigned yet. \n\nNow I'm scratching my head as to next steps. I'm usually out before expo. Now that my both calls are ITM, even if I somehow don't get assigned, there is no way I'm gonna make max profit without the stock tanking, right?\n\nSorry everything is backwards in my head! Any suggestions or even clarification would be appreciated. "
	COMMENT: ['2017-07-26 19:53:21'] If it is fact a debit spread then the fact it went through both strikes is good for you. You can and should close it Thu or Fri (latest) to realize the full or very close to full profit. Not sure what you mean by $12 profit. In dollar terms, the spread is $250 wide. You, let's say, paid $100 for it. You should profit $150 which is $250 max value of the spread minus your debit (which I'm just guessing was $100). You can avoid assignment and should be closing this profitable trade before close on Friday. To avoid the earnings gamble, I would close it tomorrow before earnings report and just take the profits even if it's not reach max profit yet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-12 09:26:02'] Selling puts in a bear market takes balls. Or stupidity. Or maybe those are the same thing?I'm frankly surprised you ever made money selling puts on those straight-down tickers this year. How did you select strikes (what delta?) and what DTE?I'm not a fan of rolling for the sake of rolling. You need to have ever increasing confidence in the probability and size of profit to roll. Like if your original goal was a 70% chance to make $100, if you roll, you need to have an 80% chance to make $120 (net of the loss on the roll, so if you opened for a $100 credit then had to pay $169 to close for a -$69 loss, you have to make $189 on the new contract to net a $120 credit on the roll), and if you roll again, a 95% chance to make $150 (net net).More about rolling here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourroll

No one knows when the sale prices start to go up, so I say just start buying.  Dollar cost average it, even.  If you like LEAPS, put them in the mix.  I would personally not go more than 25% in LEAPS,  but that's my risk tolerance.  In fact I'm right at about 25% right now, come to think of it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 18:25:05'] Mostly shares.If you time the bottom precisely, then ITM LEAPs will be more profitable than shares. BUT LEAPs are a leveraged position, and as any leveraged position they amplify both gains AND losses. The more sure you are you can time the bottom, the more likely its timing is to bite you. If you got shares and market decides to play dead for a couple of years, you'll still have shares (it's unlikely all of those companies will go bankrupts). If you got LEAPs, they can expire worthless.In addition LEAPs:\-Have higher trading costs, more so if you don't know how to trade moderately-illiquid options without crossing most of the spread.\-Need management and can cause awkardness near expiration time. No big deal, but if, say, you're very busy with something else, shares won't require attention.LEAPs will.\-Are likely less tax-efficient long term (though that depends on details of how you manage them).&#x200B;Having said that, getting some shares and some LEAPs can be called for -- when you have two good strategies, some-of-each is often a better choice than either. But if I had to choose one, shares.

I'm not doing stock since I think they will grow and I want to keep cash free in case the market still tanks.I am also selling a few OTM puts (on margin at least partially) that I will keep some of all of if assigned.  The goal is to keep cash available and be able to keep attacking when I see opportunities.It depends on your view.  LEAPS are great, but they depreciate and if you lose too much delta you can't run call diagonals safely anymore.  You also can't wait forever, even with a 2 year one.  The past 2 years spoiled is with LEAPS, so just remember they can burn you and never recover if we're sideways or going down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 00:00:40'] LEAPS are relatively expensive if you buy 2 years out. Buying 1 year out at this climate is risky, multiple rate hikes can keep the market flat, or at least gaining less than the premium you lose. I moved from leaps to stocks recently. Wait for VIX sub 20 before leaping. Definitely not before FOMC, you will take a big IV hit.

Buy DITM and you can get a greater % return (or loss) for each dollar spent on the contract(s).

Also I typically use the 70 Delta on LEAPS but in this environment, maybe go up to 80 Delta and as far out as possible. Time and Delta will be your friend. SOFI will probably need more time to really do anything, I would just start casually building a position in only shares. I don’t see a reason to jump in right away with the LEAPS. If you have 100k, I personally would just start accumulating shares and averaging down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 06:40:50'] I'm doing similar - just purchased CRM leaps and cash secured puts and looking at others similar to your list. I was looking at ADBE and ADSK. ADSK has lower PE, less pandemic run up (20% and ADBE is up 40% since Jan 1, 2020), and less susceptible to new companies.  While speculative, ADSK may benefit if gov moves on infrastructure.Downside - everyone seems to disagree: ADBE grew 3x from 2017 to Jan 2020 and ADSK 2.3, so it has a larger recent growth trend. Any ADBE stats to sell me on?Hadn't considered GOOG/AMZN which I guess is dumb to avoid those.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 06:41:21'] I mean… everything is relative. Depends of alot of factors. Right now buying leaps would be a mistake since IV is sooooo high. It will get crushed, so will your options price.If you want to buy leaps wait for a real drop in volatility.Personally I rather buy stock and sell short term covered calls (30-45 days out) in an IRA account.In a cash account im literally 5% stock, 1% long options, 94% short options which means im the one selling you these calls and waiting for that IV crush, only thing is I sell 30-60 days out only for faster decay.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 08:50:17'] I think any expiration over 60 days is dumb. So if that's what you mean by "LEAPS", just buy shares. You don't have to buy 100 shares. You could pay the same dollar amount you would pay for a call. Use a fractional share broker if the shares are expensive. Shares have the advantage of no expiration and no theta decay. The only thing you give up is leverage. The only time I've traded options with more than 60 DTE is for synthetic stock, and the only reason I didn't just buy shares was because of nasty tax consequences of those particular shares, like having to file a K-1."Once the market reaches bottom" made my lol, btw. Since you seem to realize no one knows when that will happen, what is your entry strategy? I favor just closing my eyes and picking an entry point, if it goes down after that, fml, but for me it feels worse to wait too long and miss the recovery, which can turn around by 30% in less than a day. If you can't stomach that, just DCA.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 14:26:03'] >Not trying to time the market here.LEAPs are options and options have a time component. Whenever you buy a LEAP, you are betting on reaching a specific price in a defined timeframe. Even if you feel like you are playing it safe and not timing the market, by entering a strike at a defined date, you are timing the market. So in essence, the stock price, strike price and premium in which you enter the options contract is critical to making a profit. Stocks are safer than options, but individual stocks carry their own risk. However, you don't have the time risk of expiry, so if you believe in that company you can hold until you want to / can sell.The way I see LEAPs is to enter into a contract only when there is a good margin of error, same as stocks, that at least you'll breakeven, so as to not lose your premium.

Do not recommend holding into earnings.I would also stay away from unprofitable shitcos like you listed above while fed still hiking. IV is high on those for a reason.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-17 09:27:27'] I see from your other comments that you are looking for underlings that are on the lower side. First off, I would always suggest choosing solid companies. Some underlying offer great IV%, but that is typically for a reason. If you get caught holding garbage, the risk of never recovering is greater.Additionally, this may not be short put environment. The market has been on a clear down turn, and we have not yet had confirmation of recovery. I highly suggest you take this into consideration and adjust your trading strategies accordingly. We have had a few days of green, but there are still leading indicators that the market has more to fall. I could be wrong, but I could be right. My point is, don't try to time the market. Wait for confirmations and trade the opportunities the market gives you. Don't try to force the strategy you know. Some I would suggest looking into are below. Keep in mind these are only suggestions for you to look into. My perspectives could be different from yours, or could be flat out wrong. F, Ford is a solid company long term. They may be one of the better positioned established vehicles companies to take on the EV market. Price levels before COVID crash was about $9.80. The Sept monthly 10P is going for 0.33 at 19 delta. I would suggest waiting for a market pull back to sell, as we are just in a few green days in a row. You could also turn this into a spread to reduce the buying power required by 50% while only giving up 10% premium. PLTR might be at a consolidated price (for now). It seems to be riding the $8-9 range. The premiums are good for the price level, and the company has little debt with substantial cash. As the fed hikes prices, growth becomes more difficult for companies across the border. Ideally their cash holdings will let them continue to operate at growth levels without worrying about the increase to cost of acquiring capital. Their earnings is soon, so you may want to wait for confirmation of this thesis from Q2 results/guidance.CLF, X are two steel companies I have been trading for the last year or so (typically strangles). They have always been liquid for me, and a good contender. BUT, we are facing potential recession dynamics which will cause commodities to drop in demand, and this the related producers will have their stock values decrease. Now might not be the time to trade short puts on these, but I do think they are worth the mention to add to your list for future candidates. CCL, Carnival Cruise Lines. Oh my. What to say. They are near COVID crash lows os 7.80 and trading at 9.15. They are riddled with debt. But, if you believe in the cruise market this may be a good candidate with higher risks. A Sept 7.5P trades for 0.66 at 24 delta. Assignment gives you a cost basis of 6.84, while COVID low was 7.80. You can also turn this into a spread, reducing the buying power reduction by 33% and premium received by 8%. This has the same risks of recession, and oil prices highly impact this market. Maybe now is the time, maybe not.GOEV, Cannot EVs. This is a much riskier trade as it is a newly publicly traded company and is an EV startup. They have been trending down, but recently announced a contract with Walmart to provide them 4500 EV's. Two days later they announced the military is accepting an undisclosed number of vehicles to consider them for future contracts. IV has shot up, and this might provide a speculative opportunity. The Sept 2.5P is trading at 0.22 at 13 delta. The Aug options chain will have more strokes available on Monday. I would suggest letting their price fall a bit before considering a trade. Again, this one is riskier and more speculative. Could be a bag holder here. Again, I suggest treading carefully here and choosing stocks you would be happy holding for a good amount of time in the event of economic recession. We haven't had confirmation of market recovery, so more down turn is still a plausible outcome.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 22:11:32'] If you want something less risky than stocks, I'm a big fan of CSPs on the GLD ETF. To be fair, I actually sell naked puts with half the collateral to leverage up, but that's besides the point.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-17 07:44:29'] $MAC has relatively nice premium on CSPs right now considering the nature of the underlying stock IMO. Only has monthlies though, no weeklies. $SRNE too if you write ATM and it has weeklies. Risky and volatile, so you’ve gotta be ok with getting assigned, but if you like the stock 🤷🏼‍♀️Those 2 are the main ones I’m writing CSPs on right now bc I like both and am using the premium to accumulate shares. I did write one contract on FFIE, but that’s not a stock I really want to own much of, so not throwing a bunch at it

	COMMENT: ['2015-05-02 10:38:03'] As always, what was the plan before you went in? Follow that plan. If there was no plan, I would have suggested taking the loss and go into the next trade with a plan for profit, loss and possible rolling. In this case, AMZN came back on Friday. All trading is super easy in hindsight, not so easy in real time. No one knows which way AMZN is going to go, though they may have an opinion, may have a position.99.99% of options that are ITM by even a penny will be assigned on an actively traded underlying like AMZN. As for your odds for next week, if your platform doesn't show probabilities, it probably shows delta. The chance of ITM is approximately the delta of your option.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-26 08:42:13'] If you can get any credit at all for a call that is both OTM and above your cost basis, continue doing that, even if it's just for pennies. You only have to worry when there is no strike that is above your cost basis that pays anything at all. Then you have to start gambling on your stock *not* recovering above your cost basis for the duration of the short call hold. That's not a great place to be for a long shares trader. Probably one of the biggest mistakes you can make, when holding growth stocks for the long term, is to bet against their recovery.If the only thing you can trade is CCs, maybe don't use options at all. Just sit out the downturn and wait for the recovery with full exposure to the upside.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-26 08:29:30'] It’s a tough spot to be in. Been there often, and as someone already replied, your broker is making it worse. You desperately need to be able to wheel, but better is the permission to execute calendar calls or diagonal calls for credit. In a calendar or diagonal spread you simultaneously buy back your (cheaper) expiring call and sell the new one next week (or month) at the same or higher strike to lower both your basis and your risk and work yourself out of the hole. This works for csp as well. If your broker doesn’t allow these basic tools you need to have a heart to heart with them on the phone and insist on it. They are destroying your position in otherwise tradable and profitable options. I’ve been in the hole for weeks and months at a time. But I can roll weekly calendar calls just otm (or even just itm) and take in 1-2% premium every week. And I always have the option of rolling a 2-3 week diagonal (with minimal credit or debit) taking those weeks off and coming back with a better strike. Not fun, but it saves money in the long run. Or I can just take the miserable assignment and roll csp. Whatever your choice, you need these tools. Explain it to your broker and insist on them.I hate monthlies and leaps btw. They have their unique place and purpose, but earning money isn’t one of them. The premiums over time are far too small for the risk to your position. A lot can happen in a month, let alone a year. Rolling weeklies you pick up 1/2-2% a week with fast decay, which easily beats a 3 month contract. Also it is cheaper and easier to exit or adjust your position in an emergency.

Just create multiple margin accounts with each broker. Why not do all of this through one margin account? Because, they get pissed. So now we'll go to the US. You've got $800k left over. Create multiple margin accounts with Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab (US brokerages). You can use margin for 50% of the position, lame but I'm fine with that. Add $200,000 cash through each broker (x4), gets you another $1.6 million of GameStop shares and only costs you $800k. Giving you a total of $4.3 million in GameStop shares. Also an additional perk in creating multiple margin accounts is, day trades are counted for each individual margin account, so now you have 90 day-trades PER WEEK. FUCK ME WITH A GOD DAMN BRICK.

Would there be any value to "moving money around"... perhaps between accounts?I don't trust them, like everyone here. So I have to ponder what nefarious, unscrupulous, or shady shit could they be doing? I find it difficult to believe it's "just a computer" doing stuff. There's always someone behind it. Abnormal behavior isn't a thing at their level of money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-08 01:48:48'] I'm long on gme but will occasionally throw some money on weeklys. I could be wrong but it seems this would be necessary to cause a gamma squeeze. If enough people bought weeklys not too far out of the money it could cause a gamma squeeze and sky rocket the price to neverland. Maybe we were the catalyst the whole time?

If there is any new competitor that comes out with something better and challenges either company, they're fucked.MSFT is what I call jack of all trades master of none. They're in home computers, office software, cloud computing & storage, gaming, VR, etc etc. Any of these division could take a massive hit and the company will still churn out profits.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 10:41:46'] Very interesting post, from what you’ve written your trading style is mostly based on intuition? Not that that’s a bad thing, I’ve seen success with that style especially if they’ve had a lot of time in the market and are keen on patterns.How are you not running into issues with PDT rules on a $2k account?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 10:23:07'] Appreciate youy taking the time to post this. I was always interested in scalping.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 12:06:25'] Thanks for sharing your experience. I didn’t know the PDT rule didn’t apply to cash accounts. I have a small account too. I started day trading SPY calls two days ago and made ~9% profit on both days. It’s not a lot with $xxx account but it beats losing!
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 18:00:06'] Scalping is my most successful trading style. I took an “aggressive” approach for about five weeks clearing $100-$2000/day on average. I then had a bad trade that I turned emotional on bagheld and finally dumped at a 4k loss. Since I’ve been in a “cool off” period. My scalps are super small now $10-$100/day I’ve taking the capital gained from my “hot steak” and started to trade spreads heavily for the moment. My gains are low but steady. Trying to build a new cash balance to start scalping heavily with again. Emotions are crazy in this game I love you repeat your rules every day, a true legend of a tip everyone should strive to do myself included. Just remember emotions can creep in any time. I hate losing and that one day I ignored my rules and lost bigger than I planned scared me a bit. First when I broke my rules, and second by making me timid of trying again…
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 10:13:26'] Do you really think this is sustainable? At the rate you claim to be making returns you will be one of the richest people on earth within two years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 22:13:40'] About wahat u said about SPY and QQQ, that guy is a friken dumbass. You CLEARLY said they were definitely getting alot of attention. And he has to take time out of his busy day to say you said its JUST NOW getting alot of attention. Don't worry, anyone out there that's not a complete retard( no offensive to people with disabilities) understands what you meant.  By the way, thank you for posts. I wish there were more poeple out there willing to help other. I don't care even if you did eventually want to sell something. I would definitely pay you $50 a month for daily buy and sell alerts when you are going to buy an option. If what your doing is working, so the hell what if you wanted to make money by helping others who are still learnig. It's the AMERICAN WAY! But I suppose it's ALSO the American way to want someone to do all the work for them for FREE while they sit on there ass and enjoy all the rewards that they didn't work for. Are there brokerage account making nothing off them? I don't think so. Anyways, I thought your post was very insightful and I appreciate people like you that are quite obviously trying to use your experiences to mentor others so maybe they can try your strategy and see if it works for them. Anybody thats not a complete idiot could see that if you were just trying to show off you wouldn't have taken the time to answer people's questions and try to help them out. You would've just posted the screenshots and said look at me. Anyway thanks for taking your time to try to explain things a little for people that might want to try what's working for you.

You just said you had some winners, they were "no brainers" and you had a "short feeling", and you mentioned bad news on AAPL but in the comments you said you don't trade off news.The only real info I took away from this is that you've had some wins scalping the initial balance.  And I can tell you right now if you're scalping the IB, look at put call ratio changes and put call volume.  Its eye opening.

Trying to work on my mentality.Since you also use think or swim, how do you execute bailing out on unfavorable trades ? Ie they go red as soon as you enter them ? Equity has stop loss price, how to execute the same on options ? Also can you post your trading rules that you repeat to your self ? Will help me get a baseline for my rules as well. And on pst time

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-18 09:33:17'] I have questions. Do you have any recommendations on where you get your dd from? Also how do you choose which tickers to look into? I just opened an account and have been day trading two weeks ago while I have some time off. But I actually enjoy doing this and it just makes sense now that I’m a 31 yr old single father and my two year old lives with me full time so working from home is a dream that I’m trying to realize. As of now the only way I know how to come across a ticker that I should look into is second hand. Mostly wsb. Those are a mostly pump and dumps and gambles but I justify it as I’m not buying and walking away right now I have the time to keep a close eye on charts. As I’ve taken a major interest in tA. I know that’s often times subjective and not always reliable i want to get better at other types of information gathering. Any advice or hints your willing to give would be much appreciated.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 15:56:38'] Hi there. Im excited about your success with this strategy. I too have wanted to trade like this, but thought I was trapped by the PDT rules for a sub 25k account. I'm new to trading but understand a lot of what your saying. One thing that is unclear to me is what you're looking for when you're watching the bid/ask of your option.  Is this referring to watching the price action, looking for a signal to exit the position? Or is the spread between the bid and ask significant? I'll admit I need to dig into the significance of the bid ask of options. Sorry if this is something everyone already understands except me. If that's the case, then I really need to know what your talking about!

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 17:05:30'] So I take it you trade based solely off price action since you said you don’t use any indicators? Do you watch level 2/time and sales? I traded mrna and loss alot of money this week going long and short. I had to stop trading options at the open. The inflated IV use to kill me. I’m just trying to find ways to improve my entries. I resorted to try to swing trade until I get above pdt, but I’m this market I’ve been having to range profits quicker than I would like. Last thing what broker do you use? Webull fills have really been screwing with fast moving options. I normally try to enter at midprice, but always find myself canceling and having to resubmit my order.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-17 19:11:50'] Nice! Here's my update. I finished the last 3 days green and am now up a few hundred. Crazy day today. Doubled my Cash Account, and accidentally PDT'd my margin account and got stuck holding a trade until Monday (I alternate between accounts during the day in TOS and got mixed up). Progress is being made and confidence being built. I've been cutting my winners way early and not letting them hit my targets, missing out on big gains. Have to stop fearing every pullback. If you will, how do you get out of trades quickly. I've been struggling to get out chasing the mid, and when I give up and just market sale I've lost $10-20. I'm using TOS.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-18 00:06:21'] Judging from you answering others posts, it looks like you have a good feel for the markets and enter for quick scalps with pre defined profit targets. That are hit pretty often. So I'm curious to know what's your risk reward profile like. I'm going to assume your risk is more than reward which is totally viable considering your high Winrate. Do you scalp OTM or ITM or it doesn't matter to you, (probably wouldn't make a difference for a short timeframe)And finally do you look at the underlying chart or strictly the option chart since option charts can be different than underlying
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-18 00:09:56'] Hey OP, thank you for your encouraging & motivating post. The key takeaways for me are consistency & making small gains over time. I realize that the bigger risk I take, the more emotional & irrational I become. I like the idea of 1-3 contracts. What really encouraged me was reminding me of how I began trading options with a small dollar amount in my account & grew my account decently. As my account grew, though, I ended up sinking it because I got over confident & took out too large of trades (& lost). The majority of my account now is “Buy & Hold” stock, but I am slowly dipping my feet back into options. I am starting to do options again, but allotting only a few hundred dollars until I can start showing regular success on my options trading. Thanks again. And please don’t listen to people giving you grief about not being more specific. I know my own options strategy, so I don’t need to know the exact specifics of your strategies. Thank you again. I appreciate your post. God bless you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-18 02:13:56'] Do you mostly enter after key-level break or by anticipating the move towards a key-level?
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-18 02:20:02'] I have few questions.   1. If you enter and then get faked out, do you immediately get out? I have seen many times actual breakout happen after a mini fake out. How do you handle these scenarios? 2. Do you sometimes hold your options at least for few hours if you are really confident about the stock going in your direction?

POST_TEXT: b"I'm a total noob with options so I have very limited understanding how this works. Today I bought an option for $410 on Robinhood (call at $212.5 exp 1/19/2024). Ticker AMZN. However upon checking just now, the market value for the option is now $1. My total return is now -$409 per Robinhood. I'm confused. I checked the price of the option again and it's still the same price at $4.10. Can someone help explain this to me? Did I just lose all $410 in a day? "
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-02 17:23:20'] Just as I suspected, the bid/ask is the issue.  Far OTM options are usually low liquidity.  Today's volume on this option is 1--that's right, today, you were the only person to trade an AMZN 1/19/24 212.5 strike call!  Such illiquid options usually have a very wide bid/ask and may even have no bid, which is the case here.  The bid is 0 and the ask is 4.10, which is the price you paid.After-hours options quotes aren't valid since the market is closed, so this situation might rectify itself Tuesday, but if the bid remains 0, it's difficult to accurately value this option, because the zero bid means you can't sell it.  No one is willing to buy it.I can't explain why Robinhood is telling you the value is $1.  Normally if brokerage platforms display only one price, they display the mid, which is halfway between the bid and ask, which would be 2.05 in this case.Even very liquid options have much wider bid/ask spreads than stocks.  You always have to look at the bid/ask spread when trading options.  It wouldn't surprise me if the egregious Robinhood hides this from you, but surely even they must provide a way for you look it up.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 09:36:38'] You're making a lot of rookie trader mistakes here.Perwsuming your analysis for this trade is that AMZN will be at or above $212.50 by Jan 2024 then you need to sit back and let the trade work.  You'll find out if your analysis was correct sometime in late 2023 going into the Jan 24 exp date.Robinhood does not show the mid-price of options, so this is why many get confused like you are here.  There was even a young trader who misunderstood what RH shows to where this happened - [https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance) If you want to trade options in a serious way then get off of RH as soon as you can.Looking at thinkorswim it shows this call option has a Bid of $0 and an Ask of $4.10 where you bought the option.  The mid-price which may be considered its current value is showing at $2.05.  This wide bid-ask spread is a clear indication the option has little interest or volume and should be considered illiquid.  Your option will likely trade somewhere around this $2.05 price next week for about a 50% loss since you overpaid for it to begin with.  Besides having to wait until Jan 24 to see if your premise was correct, you significantly overpaid for this option meaning the stock will have to move up a lot just to get back to what you paid.   You've made the trade and can now just check it every month or two through the end of 2023 to see how it is performing if AMZN climbs in price.  Close it at the profit or loss target amounts you set up before opening the trade.  You did set profit and loss target amounts before opening the trade, right??
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-03 10:53:08'] Lesson #1: Do not pay the ask, or sell at the bid, at least try not to.Lesson #2: Do not rush into a trade, but increment your price by a little, approaching the max price you wish to pay. See lesson #4.Lesson #3: Do not buy OTM options with money you can not afford to loseLesson #4: Do not trust your broker calculated P/L but always approximate the "fair" price by calculating the average of the bid and ask prices. In this case, the fair price is about $200, so you have an immediate $200 loss because you rushed into the trade and (over)paid the ask price.Lesson #5: Read lessons 1 to 5 every time you want to make a trade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-02 17:53:30'] The only safe consistent way for beginner to do well in options is mostly by selling premium and get theta decay in your favor…..buying options is usually a losing strategy ..selling premium well,out of the money and in time is almost guaranteed profit but not  large….for beginners selling premium is perfect as you get to receive almost immediate profit ..often in a day or two …. Just buy to close and feel good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-02 16:30:57'] Assuming the ticker didn't get delisted, the only way this could happen in one day is if the underlying stock dropped like 90%. If you're browsing afterhours the bid/ask may be messed up and makes it look like a huge loss. Options don't trade aftermarket, so come Tuesday morning it should be normal. (Monday the exchanges are closed for labor day)
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-02 16:44:45'] When posting about a position, please include all the specifics.  You've given us the strike price and the expiration date, but neglected to mention the ticker.  What is it?The answer can almost certainly be found by looking at the bid/ask.  What do you mean by saying "the value for the option is now $1" but at the same time "it's still the same price at $4.10?"  Where are you getting these pieces of information?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-02 17:20:21'] Unless you placed a market order and got filled at a ridiculous price, this doesn't compute. $212 for a AMZN call 4 months out seems about right.  Share the screen grab of when u got filled.

These options are still pretty cheap and the companies are in very low spots looking to recover and make major positive strides in the next couple years. NEPT is my deepest stock even though they’re at risk of getting delisted (yikes). But their earnings should come back strong as garlic next quarter and continue a steep growth trend and set the company up for significant growth in the next 24 months.

You can look at a 50 year chart, a 1 year, weekly, monthly whatever.  The trend has turned to the downside from everything I've seen.  I'm long many positions but have started hedging based on how we've been breaking support areas.

The Lightning is going to be the best selling EV quarter after quarter so long as chip manufacturers can keep up.  Great philosophy about carbon neutrality and more big EV news to drop between now and 2024.  I think they are poised to be Tesla’s largest competitor and Tesla has not shown me anything to separate themselves from the blue oval gang in the past 12 months.  Either Tesla crashes to a F valuation or F starts trending towards Tesla’s valuation,  I’m betting on the latter.

POST_TEXT: b"I see a few others here are trading CCs. Who has some good ideas for CC candidates right now? Let's share some ideas with the numbers.\n\nI trade well-known companies with low stock prices and relatively low margin requirements. I look for stocks where the bid for the weekly option is 1% or more of the current stock price.\n\nAs always, stocks and options involve risk and CCs are no different and this is not advice, just discussion.\n\nRight now, X is trading at $28.66. The margin requirement (Etrade) is 35%. 100 shares would require about $1000 in capital. The $29.00 call expiring on 6/18 has a bid of .97. This is almost a 10% return instantly and another 3% or so if it assigns. The caveat here is that this is a near term high level for X and may come down. I would caution against a large position here, but X always pays a relatively good premium if you wait for it to come back down a bit from here.\n\nAA is another one of my regular CCs. It is trading at $37.36. The margin requirement is als"
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 07:39:54'] I like CC, but I think selling PUTS would still be a better play. If you get assigned, then you can do CC, collect premiums both way
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 08:21:54'] I own 3400 shares of AHT at $5.23. I sold 34 covered calls for July 16 at $10 strike. That’s $4,000 premium, and max profit of $20,000 if it hits my strike price. I plan on holding share for a very long time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 08:39:26'] I wheel 2000 shares of X, cost basis 25 USD, will be called away this Friday at 28 USD.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 09:42:33'] I will never just buy and hold again. There are too many examples of being able to significantly lower my cost basis while holding shares. For example, I bought SWI after it tanked a few months ago at $15.34. Because of CCs, my basis is now down $11.25 - beneath the lifetime low of the stock. It's currently trading $17.31. Buy and hold would have a 12.8%, but instead I'm looking at close to a 54% gain.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 09:18:16'] Another additional idea to Ccs is that I often day/swing trade the calls I sell. If I sell a contract at $1.00 and the stock drops and brings the premium down to say, .30c, I will buy it back. Then I wait for the price to rise back up and sell the contracts again. I do this often with X because it makes pretty good intraday moves. I can sometimes do this several times in the same week.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 11:27:49'] Best CC stock? ASO. Sell CSPs at 35/40 (price is currently at $41). I've made $25K this year on ASO using a combination of CSPs, CCs, day trading, and buying and holding ASO. This stock will be a $100 stock in a couple of years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 11:43:26'] AMD is a potentially decent one. General consensus is that it's undervalued right now, but it's trading in channel between 79.5 and 82.5. Buy around 80 and then sell 83 weeklies. It's broken below the 78 support line twice in the last few months but it doesn't stay below it for too long. I'd love to say it'll break that pattern soon, but until XLNX merger gets all the approvals it doesn't matter how many positive things happen because the market wants to see the major merger get approved or rejected. That also makes the catalyst for breaking that channel somewhat predictable. Also, while WSB loves it, they don't have the power to move it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 07:37:01']   Steel and aluminum have gone through the roof lately,  the have been building a lot of capacity, which could lower the price and push the stocks down in the long term.  Oil and Gas has been everyone's whipping post for months. The more they open up in.other countries,  the more demand will increase. The current administration won't allow increased supply in the US. Hence, supply won't keep up with demand.   I do well with XOM and  APA. They are both volatile,  they have a lot of option trading and they seem like the safest bet in the long term.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 14:58:33'] Been doing pretty well on selling Disney CCs. 30-45 dte 180c with premium between 3.20 and 3.80 generally. I like the 175-180 range it's been in since earnings. After about 15-20 days the options have been dropping to 1.20-1.50 as the stock drops frequently to the 175-176 range, so I buy back at that level and roll the money into new calls again 30-45 dte. Before earnings I was doing the same with the 180-187.5 range. But I was happy to lower my overall share cost average when it dipped to 169. Using this strategy I'm on pace to hit around 25-35% return on the each 100 shares of DIS annually, purely from CCs alone. And have been buying and selling shares on the side as Disney fluctuates in that 175-180 range. Been doing the same with TSLA ever since it fell to the 570-630 range, which has been paying a ton more but I wouldn't really recommend it as I don't have as much faith in TSLA long term as I do DIS.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 07:52:39'] Looking at return on margin req for the stock is a bad idea, that doesn't matter unless you're fully in margin, which is also a bad idea.Use return as a % of the stock price like a normal human!

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-12 09:41:47'] I've been running a wheel strat for almost a quarter now. Here's what I've noticed:Opening- buy/writeI use short time frames, weeklies, except usually for my Core positions, one's I'd rather hold. I like to get as much downside protection as possible at open. ATM. My goal is 3%/week, and I'm averaging 3.3% in closed positions so far. I account for my premium in position until closed. There are times when some has to be given back durring quick upswings in underlying. For much of last quarter many positions went negative as underlyings fell. I was able to keep up with price drops fairly effectively, but had to sell calls lower than my cost basis and risk assignment to get decent premiums. My goal is stack premiums against loss of value in underlying, and keep as much as possible durring rebounds. At a ~10% premium on a just OTM call to open on a weekly, I'll see +13% upon assignment, in a week. Yay to that. Even if every once in a while they blow past it.Current open positions:WKHSSKLZMVISPlanning to open 2-3 more on MondayLast week closed: FCEL, NKLA, BB, AMCAverage position time: 2-3monthsNote on risk against underlying "mooning"AMC I sold at 17STK while it's price 5Xed. I got over 100% on position so not mad. I had returned ~40% in premium alone before assignment. When that rise began I think I was at a 13STK and able to roll up to 17 before it wasn't worth it anymore to me. WKHS I had to pay back a bunch of my premium to close out durring last rip, got it all back next contract at better STK. Best protection against that is to create an independent position, I call my Core. You can do this by using a percentage of your premium to build position over time. High IV I occasionally sell against part of my Core holdings. Last month alone WKHS popped quickly twice and I was able to sell far OTM Calls against half of my Core position for roughly 5% ROI for entire Core position each time. It has to be worth it to me to risk some of my Core and at a STK I am comfortable selling it at. Speculation comes into play, but I'm enjoying this strat as I collect real cash for my positions. Short time frames gives me a lot of flexibility. Compound those percentages over the year and it really does add up. These positions alone returned ~+10% my entire account this quarter, with another 10% still accounted for in open positions.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-12 06:18:47'] I’ve been holding AMZN since 2001, and only in the last few years started learning anything about actually trading options. I’ve thought about covered calls, but never had the guts to do it, because the stock tends to move in unpredictable (to me) surges. I feared losing it and being unable to get back in at an affordable price, as I still think it is a great investment with ongoing huge growth potential. I’ve also considered buying leaps, and I think your idea is a great one, and the only way that I would consider selling calls on AMZN. The price can fluctuate by hundreds of dollars in a matter of days though, so keep that in mind. It has been both a thrilling and sometimes gut-wrenching hold at times over the last 20 years, but still holding, and so glad I held.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-12 08:50:44'] I really love my XLK LEAPS. I prefer tech ETFs over single stocks. They're so affordable and yield pretty good returns similar to QQQ.Top holdings are in AAPL and MSFT (although no GOOG/AMZN/FB), and also includes non-traditional tech stocks like MA/V/PYPL.

I don't care if there will be a chance of reversal or not, its more important to just survive and keep losses small so that I can live again to fight another day.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-26 13:13:11'] Well your completed answer is only as complexed as your understanding.  You should never trade options manually unless it is a long term play or a short term diamond handed moment with lots of built up pressure and hedgie manipulation.  Then you need to understand there are two version of trading,  buying for a well time guess or selling betting time will pass before they win that bet. Now there are million ways to combine a sell type bet with a buy bet creating limits of risk or potential on either side. But before you learn.how to limit the beast you must start with understanding and mastering the understanding of each side.Once you perfectly understand one option symbol as far as price action movement versus time and approximately what each option would produce as a result of the price action. Then you understand all individual options. After the individual understandings of the mathematical consistencies then you can compare to other stocks, realizing option price versus stock size at the money options is the best way to compare the two most comparable option chains. Then you see how much riskier volatility makes the stock prices. So they drive the prices up to drive up the IV crash down to rob the bag holders and then build narratives around the next burst and continually suck from society.  Anyways, there is also a world of opportunity for sellers of the world that just like sound math and historical back testing certainties.  Selling calls and puts with months to expire in the SPY and anytime a big move happens you add another leg and then another and you set each bet to a maximum of 3-10% of your account balance,  you will at least double money yearly. Anyone that wants to build the perfect stock market money algo the answer is simple and it's a cross margin credit spread between the SPY and SPX options, using the dividend date of the spy you can see the pattern in the spread of the stock prices and constantly find opportunities that based on the spread expected you can set up a credit larger than the spread and sometimes by large margins, and based off the logic you should be able to double money quarterly and the potential should be near infinite because the system is designed to be liquid to anyone as much as they can afford. I'm more worried about my American rights and responsibilities other the money,  so if you have any specific questions or think I missed a spot let me know.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 10:08:35'] SPY can move many times more than $10 in a single tick, particularly in the down direction. Assuming you are trading ATM.FWIW, you might consider XSP instead of SPY. It's cash settled so you are less likely to end up in an undercapitalized situation at expiration. XSP doesn't have as good liquidity as SPY, but that isn't saying much since almost nothing has as good liquidity as SPY.If you insist on using SPY, consider $1 wide vertical spreads. Then your max loss is capped at less than $100. It often won't be more than $70. You could also do this with XSP.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 11:28:32'] 10 dollars / trade using options?You are limiting yourself to options that cost 0.1 or less.  GL
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 09:43:35'] I think you can do that, just realize how spy can get real wonky sometimes. My scalping strat is to sell by 10% gain at very clear trend lines and such and I’ve been doing well. Stay true to strategy. Sell profit, cut loses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 15:48:43'] You'd need more money for that since commissions, fees, and slippage would instantly eat away at your gains. Strategies involving vertical spreads would probably work better for such a small account size.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 16:39:57'] You have the right idea.  Without day trades though you will want to do further expiration options and specifically spreads will give you a much higher chance of success.  For the most part buying a $10 individual option on SPY is throwing away that $10 to theta burn quickly but if you use a $10 spread you will be much closer to the money, the premium will move slower, and your chance of success will be much higher.I would personally recommend risking slightly more than that and just watching it for a $10 stop loss.  For example if you sell a $30 credit spread that is a $70 risk technically but as long as you are far dated you could buy back the position at $40 for a $10 loss.  There is a chance it could blow past your strikes after hours and you will need to buy it back for a bigger loss ($70 being the max loss) but if you sell these a month or two out that will be far less likely.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 17:18:43'] Judging from the fact that you are asking about a stop loss of 1%, I can tell you can’t handle the risk. In this case, stay away from options.Options can easily move that much in a minute. Even a stop loss of 10% is likely a bit too small, since at the money leaps 1 year out are leveraged at 4x to 5x, that translate to 2% move in the underlying for a 10% move in options…Also beware that options usually have a large spread, and brokers don’t always mark the options price the same way. Some brokers use last trade price, some use the bidding price, some use mid price between ask and bid and other uses more complex algorithms. (The best estimate is usually the mid price between ask and bid). As a result, your stop loss might get triggered early by mistake.

Questrade is a Canadian broker.You have all option chain, charts, order entry to practice with...but sadly they dont repeat SPY or QQQ data. But all other stock options are ok.When you buy a Deep out of the money option on expiration day (0DTE), you might find a $10 (or $2-$4) option at the open, which may explode to $100 within hours. From $10 to $100 is a 1000% gain.Timing these very cheap trades, without stops, lets you hone all your skills in real time. Once you are consistently profitable, you can trade real money with confidence. Start today. Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 07:11:40'] You may have been right about the strategy, the direction, etc. but all of that is null and void the moment you used money you couldnt afford to lose (margin) and didn't have a safety net by leaving your work. It's an unfortunate lesson, but ultimately on the bright side you - hopefully - won't make the same mistake again in regards to almost maxing out your margin and playing with margin calls. If you feel confident in your strategy, re-deploy but with only money you can afford to lose. Also unless you have a nest egg built up, relying on the *market* which can be the most unpredictable but accessible wealth-building tool ever built, I would really re-think your decision to stop work / cutting off a reliable source of income.Sorry if this sounds preachy, I don't mean it to be.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 07:55:44'] My number one rule is Live to trade another day This goes hand in hand with the most common rookie mistake: Trading too bigDoesn’t matter how good the idea, the stock, if there a chance that a person loses everything, it is almost inevitable. In your case it was maybe 10 or 20 percent chance per month of a margin call. Knowing that, it is only gambling to go all in on margin on that kind of play. Even if you were much more conservative and there was only a five percent chance of margin call each month, you’d be lucky to last a year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 10:36:58'] I think the right balance is work your regular job, maybe for a few less hours a week. In the mean time, do options on the side. I’ve been doing the same but I haven’t cut my hours yet. Keeping my portfolio small and strategies safe. Not using margin— only cash secured and covered positions so at the end of the day, I still have an asset that may appreciate in time so at least there’s the opportunity of digging myself out of a hole (even if it is delayed). I’ve been wheeling AAL since New Years so that’s mainly why I’m reading your post. This the first time I’m trying this out. AAL is almost a 7% return in the 3.5 months so it is my least profitable position. Hoping to get out at a profit soon and redirect those funds to a blue chip. Sorry about your position, hope you figure it out. If I ever get back in, it’ll have to be around the $12 range again
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 05:47:12'] Ouch man. That’s kind of crazy. I just trade with money I don’t necessarily need right now. And I def would never quit my job to live off trading full time. That way too much pressure. This sounds like Russian roulette tbh. There’s always risk with margin you just have to be strong enough not to go in all the way it can ruin you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 10:20:57'] I think maybe this would be a good time to explore why you were so confident in the trade. I would ask why I bet so much even when warned by others.This isn’t an issue of being smart or dumb— it’s greed and / or arrogance. Unless you actively work to change your attitude, you might make the same mistake again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 17:51:58'] All of this could have been avoided if you had simply entered an appropriately sized position from the start

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 13:02:45'] I was doing some research last night to decide my entry strategy with BB & reading this is definitely additional confirmation bias. I do like the idea of selling puts for a lower in, I was going to just place a limit order. In addition to some 10-30% OTM call leaps considering they're mad cheap & it's my own personal opinion that BB will upside tremendously the next year. Thanks for this g!
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 13:08:50'] Novice here.  Could I ask why not buy call options for March at $11?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 12:27:46'] Let’s say you wanted to put $10,000 in BB and thought the price was going to rise. How would you allocate that money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 13:55:31'] Purchased shares avg @11.2 usd.  Sold some puts also. I will continue to sell puts in high IV.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 13:43:58'] I have done very well this season with synthetic longs. The March 6, 14 put is 3.05 and the call is 3.  If I open them both I essentially get a free call to the 🌝.  If it doesn't take off I end up buying 100 shares.  On similar securities the put loses value faster than the call gains which gives me the opportunity to buy back the put for profit and get my capital back.  I'd then ride the call to the week or so before expiry.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 14:23:06'] So if I wanted to buy BB, you will recommend shares and not calls? I was thinking even if IV is high, is BB can rise more than the premium I pay, I will earn a lot more than owning shares right? Just like GME
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 14:23:46'] Those Jan29 25C look juicy. I feel like after gme last week, we might see something with bb this week.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 14:56:19'] Thanks.Just a note though. Expected move is almost never symmetrical due to volatility skew. I highly suggest taking that in account.One can calculate an actual expected move using options prices, noting the difference between call and put premiums.

I’m already ITM, so reading all the blogs seems like BB is about to 🚀🚀🚀🚀. In this case if I want to hold for a long run , aren’t I better off exercising my 05 Feb call option and hold  on to my equity ? Or shall I just close it before expiry then purchase the stock at market price ? P.s Not sure why my font changed all of a sudden. My apology.

I'm not super smart on leaps - when is the ideal time to take profits on a leap? IV is much higher then when I bought and there seems to be a ton of hype from the other sub.. however, 1/23 is a loooong time away and if BB moons like other meme stocks I feel I'm leaving money on the table. Maybe there's a term for this - happy to research, would just love a push in the right direction.

There is a phrase traders often say " sell when vol is high and buy when vol is low" does this refer to IV rank aka option IV and its behaviour over the past year or so, or does this mean  IV relative to historical volatility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is an example with AMZN\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/zshhlttw1iy81.gif\n\nHV is greater than IV, so this makes me think the options are cheap and maybe I can put on a straddle or to be more cost effective a long butterfly HOWEVER looking at TOS and the IV, IV seems to be high \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lz7v0bhv2iy81.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3b79c7f2a3f4216667ba12d27dc40aa466f3e9ce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo which is it? are AMZN options expensive, also which software is accurate because the HV on TOS is giving me an HV of like 0.10 as opposed to the OIC website which is saying 0.6 or 60%.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:26:57'] IV Percentile is what you seek.[https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/tools/strategy-selection-iv-percentiles-15527](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/tools/strategy-selection-iv-percentiles-15527)
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:23:47'] TOS uses the Bjerksund-Stensland model, IVOL could be using something different. It also looks like IVOL is using an index, so that would also have different results
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:47:23'] Think of IV as a forecast of future realized volatility. If you think the security you’re considering trading will have a larger or smaller range, and a larger or smaller expected range (more or less demand for options) then you know to buy (if larger) or sell (if smaller). Sometimes looking at IV rank and historical IV is misleading since there’s nothing that says the IV won’t go higher or lower. In general it’s good to avoid selling when IV is depressed and buying when it’s too high
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 14:58:33'] There are many different IV's,* Historic -- Useless it has happened* Option IV per Strike -- Not what you want , it is the IV to the Option Model that makes the current Bid/Ask price come out* Vol Index -- Which is what you see on the right side of the option chain , even when that option Chain is closed. Tos has some proprietary way, Tasty uses a Vix style (Atm combined with a few of the close Otm ). I  think both are pretty close,  and kinda Vix like. I do not know what formula either uses.If you want more try this vid.   [http://ontt.tv/2vTPn6m](http://ontt.tv/2vTPn6m)  Tom Preston  9min mark, he worked on both with the programmers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 15:13:00'] You should check your settings on TOS, because HV was well over "0.10" when you wrote this post.When trading options, you are buying or selling the IV. Ultimately - what is your prediction on volatility moving forward?  Will it be less volatile? Then sell.  Will it be more volatile? Then buy.   Yes you can use HV to help guide your decision (no guarantees of course).  For example you are looking at a ticker that consistently has IV above HV, then the market has consistently Overpriced the options and selling will often be a good play.  Vol also tends to mean-revert, which can be another tool to guide your decisions.  Then you have known events like earnings, which will inflate IV... Hope that helps and gives you a few things to start digging into more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 17:03:19'] Swing trading is not easy. I guess none of this is but I’ve found swing trading requires too much worry and too much to chance (many chances for news to break) for my taste. My own personal experience with it is slightly better than breakeven though I should have made more. Exit strategies were not good. Different greed dynamics at play for different strategies I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 20:51:33'] You look at the charts the exact same way but on a daily or weekly basis instead. You identify you key levels (entry/exits) support & resistance, set a stop loss, profit target, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 06:32:23'] You can swing >45 DTE credit spreads. Keep positions relatively small and you won't have to check your phone every 2 min and you'll be able to work in peace.You can sell them  ~.30 Delta/Near-the-money  for some decent Delta, depending on your level of risk.Ultimately, it comes down to position size.You could even trade weekly ATM credit spreads with say 1 spread. So, for example, a 1 ATM < 4 DTE SPX Put Credit spread has a risk ratio of 1:1.5, or $200/$300. Say you put the GTC stop loss order (to avoid max loss), keeping your risk 1:1. Say you enter every Monday at market open (blindly), for that Friday's expiration, by end of that week you'll either have made $200 or lost $200. Won't make or break ya, but still keep you involved.Could also do SPY or XSP ATM weekly Put credit spreads  for $45/$55. I mean yeah, it's only $45-$50 per week but i like to think of it as "beer money" and it's just a way to get engaged in the market without all the drama.I've been trading using these low risk methods for years, with relative success. i still work full time, often dealing with clients so it's important for me to keep my head cool and not be all anxious over my trading activity. 😅
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-05 09:57:07'] Just do something simple with daily bars. Buy low RSI and sell high RSI. Only trade popular ETFs like QQQ or SPY or SMH. If you try to trade individual stocks you can get caught in some wild moves, especially during earnings season.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 17:22:51'] I agree with most posts here, don't buy at open, but after lunch.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 17:11:07'] Successful swing trading happens when you have all your attention on your plays, buying and selling within minutes is usually the key to sustainable success in swing plays.  I wouldnt suggest opening new positions at 9:30 if u have to pay attention at work, you’ll lose more than you’ll win if u dont sell fast when theres green.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 17:42:22'] If I could do it all over again, I would have just bought stocks weekly/daily when the market is volatile and buy leaps.  I used to work nights and I would get off work (14-16 hr shift) right before market opened and try to trade before going to bed.  I would then get up an hour before close to see if I got destroyed or not.Now I just follow a trader on Twitter that gives out alerts and just buy when I get alerted and set a SL or DCA if I'm certain it'll go my way.  I work dayshift now but don't have time to keep eyeing my positions, so I normally buy options or spreads 30+ days out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 18:25:10'] "starting a 9-5 job soon" + "swing trading" = just don't. Or throw your money into the toilet. Same effect. Swing trading IS your 9-5. You don't swing trade unless it is your full time gig and that is what you are doing for a living. Just do longer term trading you can do during breaks and make use of GTC orders and stop losses/determined loss trades.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 23:08:26'] Yes it’s common but not it doesn’t commonly work. You’ll need the price to move more than what’s expected, and than also even more than that to account for some theta decay on top of that to be profitable on this type of trade. The reason it doesn’t really work is because of iv crush
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 14:40:25'] The 2nd hardest out of the three. I only do this when I'm feeling fancy. Most likely short straddles (or iron condor),  or long double diagonal for earnings. I will not use long straddle or strangles. I will get punished. If your going to use long straddles use for good news bad news, only use if before 2 weeks there is a consolidating channel or triangle. The rsi states that you are in a trend heading into earnings waiting for breakout. ( if your fancy use money flow indicator a prediction indicator,and volume profile should work for using this) . Good luck I would never try to use long straddles.

Then calculate as risk/reward assessment, then choose if it is worth while.&#x200B;Randomly picking a popular name is useless.  You need to look at cost, volatility, liquidity.  Iron condor on the spy sounds outright scary,  go look at the charts and volatility lately.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 18:07:15'] Hey guys, I am pretty new here so I can’t post but I want to ask about how I lost money on my Netflix strangle with a huge price drop after the earning call.So I bought 500 put and 600 call on 4/20 when Netflix stock price was 550. 500 put costs 2.42 and 600 call costs 3.5 with expiration date 4/23. During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. Next day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.From my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.I consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?
