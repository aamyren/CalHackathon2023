Tesla's cars score the highest of any brand in the EuroNCAP tests nowadays, which are the official European safety tests. If a court calls those cars unsafe, every brand in the world would have to refund their cars.

The company must refund the full purchase price to the plaintiff.June 15, 2023 - 5:11 pm Now shareThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had "actual severe defects". Source: APTesla Model SThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had "actual severe defects".Berlin, D√ºsseldorf The electric car manufacturer Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered on Monday that Tesla must refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The reason is "serious defects in driving comfort and safety", including unwanted braking.As far as is known, there is no higher court judgment against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The decision of June 12 has 14 pages and reads like a reckoning with the statements that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making about the quality of his driver assistance systems for years, often under the term "Autopilot".
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:09:04'] I think tesla is in trouble. They got so big in their early years because the tech in their cars was better than other brands, their electric range was higher than anyone else, and they were the only brand capable of mass producing electric cars to meet demand. This was the reason so many people were overlooking the very clear quality control issues that they have. The most important thing they had to do was solve their QC issues before other brands caught up. However, other brands caught up and tesla still faces terrible QC concerns. This may affect them a lot in the future. Now, other brands have similar or better technology and driving assistance. Everybody has a big screen, a trend that Tesla started.Other brands have developed better autonomous systems than Tesla. Mercedes, GM, and Ford are the top now.Other brands have electric cars that equal or beat Tesla's range and charging speeds.Other brands are able to produce and develop electric cars at a good rate. It can be argued that brands are still catching up in this sense, but they are most definitely catching up at rapid speed.The last current saviour for Tesla is their far superior charging network. This was something that was planned to take ***years*** for other brands to catch up to. However, they are catching up fast. Furthermore, other brands are now gaining access to tesla charging network. This is another nail in the coffin for tesla.Tesla is running out of time to solve their issues. They need to address the issues in their cars before the other brands leave them in the dust. When the other brands have better electric cars that are readily available and affordable, along with good charging networks, tesla will struggle to sell units.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 09:37:30'] Explains why Elon Musk is in Europe right now, even though the "positive" pushing news is saying he is out there promoting Tesla and gaining new investors lol. When in fact he's out there personally trying to put out fires due to Tesla FSD and auto pilot being so darn awful official government agencies have to go after him and sit him down like a child who knew full well what he was doing was wrong in the first place, and sit him down and scold him and ground him and give Elon Musk a consequence for his negative behavior. Like a child! lol.The number of times Tesla and Elon Musk have been involved in covering up or reducing the seriousness of the issues and problems regarding the public safety and driver safety with his cars on the road probably should be taken into account at some point once enough accidents/deaths have occurred to make the information seem more prevalent, like what is the difference between a transparent company and Tesla?A transparent company has no secrets.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 09:53:28'] No one knows. But I‚Äôll give my opinion based on TSLA expected growth. $100 was a great buying opportunity, and as long as the market sentiment stays half decent we won‚Äôt see those lows again. (I still think the market needs a good drop again tho). $120-145 is a decent buy range imo, given TSLA growth and ability to still pull in profits through difficult times. Their energy department is also growing fast than their vehicles, so we should start seeing some meaningful numbers from that by EOY.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 07:41:53'] It really comes down to your risk tolerance. You're young enough to ride it out and judging from the comments it seems you have a strong stomach. As long as you're not on margin (rates far too high), using funds needed elsewhere/within ~5 years I'd say sit on your shares. There's an argument to trim your position though if it's beyond what you're comfortable with.FYI TSLA is the biggest position in my portfolio. I allow it to range 25-30% (just turned 40yo) but would be much heavier if I were younger. It's allowed me to buy heavily (2018, 2020, 1/2023) and trim accordingly. Also acts as a North Star wherein I operate based on predetermined rules rather than random decisions which are susceptible to emotion. It's volatile as fuck but it also IMO will provide the best return of any mega cap for the foreseeable future.

This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment.

Furthermore, the confrontation with the West and the economic competition is becoming more intense, there are talks of decoupling, multinational firms are starting to establish alternative supply chains, there are already some strategic bans on technology transfers on the us side (semiconductors) and import bans (xianjiang), I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if within the next 5 years China retaliates and Tesla gets trapped. Of course, all automotive OEMs have a footprint in China, but mostly in their supply chains, i don‚Äôt think any of them have that much China exposure to their top line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:25:35'] I‚Äôm in the same boat and honestly don‚Äôt see how the company can move forward with a huge market share anymore. I work in tech in a very red state, so my workplace is pretty 50/50 with different viewpoints, but almost everyone I work with can actually afford a Tesla. There‚Äôs a very weird paradox that has developed in the past year and it does not fair well for Tesla at all in my opinion:Last year, all of my younger coworkers (myself included) loved Elon, and also loved Tesla. All of my older coworkers didn‚Äôt care about Elon, but hated Tesla.Now in the present, all of my younger coworkers hate Elon and also hate Tesla. Some of these folks have traded in their Teslas lol. All of my older coworkers love Elon, but they still hate Tesla.Overall, now EVERYONE I work with hates Tesla. Now my workplace could be a bad representation of the country as a whole, but in my personal experience the future does not look bright.

Use a zip code in Bay Area like 94040. I‚Äôm pretty sure there were almost no Model X a week ago. Today, I see dozens of Model X configs available. I imagine those who can afford a 100+k car are more sensitive to exactly what you described. These are likely orders placed months ago that the customer decided to cancel. Of course the recession is playing a role but it looks more than that. On the other hand, Model 3 inventories are gone, likely the $7,500 incentive helped.I‚Äôve been in and out of TSLA since IPO. Was long till 2 years ago and  turned bearish because I realized we were in a textbook style asset bubble. My mistake was starting puts a bit too early and had to take some loss (offset easily by gains from other tech stocks), but as of now, I‚Äôm in a fairly good position.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:34:36'] Nice job.  I was also a Tesla fan and can‚Äôt help but wonder if full self driving is significantly impacting their credibility.  Elon said it will be fully functional in a couple years around 8 years ago at this point.  I don‚Äôt think people will continue to add the feature considering they haven‚Äôt delivered.  Cybertruk and the semi also seem to be having problems delivering.  Elon has also indicated they are building a robot now?  I can only assume it‚Äôs to work on Mars prior to the arrival of people?  Long story short - Tesla has lost focus.  Supporters would often stand in line and put deposits on their vehicles because they believe in the mission (as you said).  As they fail to deliver, this fan base will continue to dwindle.  Add these points to the amazing point in your post and I think Tesla is in trouble.  There‚Äôs also the fact that they clearly haven‚Äôt figured out full self driving.  How many cars will they need to retrofit because they were sold as full self driving capable?

I personally have always felt TSLA was ridiculously overvalued, but if you held this long, when TSLA is finally making money and has low debt, when its fundamentals are finally starting to make sense, and you sell now? Thats dumb, justify how you want, but you arent being a good investor. But a sound investor wouldnt have bought TSLA in 2017 when it was very close to bankruptcy anyway (really it should have gone bankrupt).

And in five? And in ten? What market cap does that translate into based on a fair PE (or better yet PEG)? What's the ROI if you discount that?That's the question you should be asking yourself. Stock prices and news are just noise. Seems to me like you were gambling holding Tesla, and now you're gambling selling it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:42:32'] It‚Äôs a well developed narrative regarding your TSLA stock adventure. Since 2016 to 2022 is a longtime investment. I applaud you for your longterm investment. 1500 shares and you gained 800% and you didn‚Äôt sell is a foolish move not to sell at that time. Either way you didn‚Äôt lose any money. Elon is not unhinged, he is taking risky bets and decision is causing TSLA shareholders headache. I am certain TSLA will go back to all time high. End of 2023. Buying the dip would be ideal, many smart money managers are waiting for market to settle and fed rate hike to halt. That way buy low and sell high could be in play by next mid year. Wait for that opportunity Imo. Congratulations on your gain . Remember you gotta be in it to win it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:52:25'] The thing is it‚Äôs not going to maintain insane growth forever and obviously it was overvalued during the last year just like many other companies. It deserves a decent PE ratio, maybe like a 30, which is considered high during a regular market cycle. I think you did the right thing and the stock belongs at $70-80

Tesla is still the only EV most potential purchasers can name. His Twitter antics don't mean anything to sales, they are still selling their manufacturing capacity. The amount of people who actually care what he does with Twitter is probably fairly small.Has there been a decline in sales, or other numbers, that you're basing this on? Or is it all emotions/feelings for you?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 20:22:38'] I actually don‚Äôt think anyone cares about any of this.   You wrote a whole lot and some of it was interesting, but in the end, nobody cares.  Your anecdotal stories about your friends are just that, and nobody is looking at someone driving a Tesla and thinking ‚ÄúI bet that person believes in everything Elon musk has ever done or tweeted‚Äù.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:23:49'] Only thing that recently bothered me about Elon is the stupid decision to buy twitter for 34 billion. I guess it's better to buy a social media platform than to invest it into your own company . But hey it's not my money and I'm not one of the richest people on the planet so what do I know ? It's also only a matter of time before big car manufacturers start offering full EV vehicles at large scale.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:35:38'] The only thing I will say is that Elon is not more right wing than he has been in the past. His beliefs roughly map out exactly the same as before.The only difference is that the left has been attacking him relentlessly for the last 5 years, and him calling out corruption on the left that has singled him out has made people on the left very angry despite Elon being correct to point out injustice and corruption in the first place.OH, Biden was the only president to not mention successful space missions because it was with SpaceX? Biden didn't invite Tesla or ever mention it when talking about EVs? Despite the fact that Trump had no interest in EVs or global warming, he still reached out to Elon with open arms, who was a very prominent and public Democrat at the time. Biden turning Elon into public enemy #1 when he has done more to advance green energy, job creation and manufacturing in the US, AI dominance, and space and energy independence/leadership is just straight up corruption because we all know who donates to Democratic politicians. Alameda County tried to literally bankrupt Tesla by being the only place to prevent manufacturing in the US indefinitely when Tesla only had one real factory producing at scale? Warren and Sanders and AOC and Reich tried to call Elon evil for the last 5 years just so they could take his Tesla shares as taxes? The media called Elon a MAGA Republican despite him never previously voting for a Republican (including Trump)? The media making up lies about his Twitter takeover and covering up the Biden laptop, government collusion, speech suppression and censorship, and blatant 1st amendment violations, and the SBF fraud while making Elon look like some evil dictator? Let it be known that the left deliberately tried to destroy Twitter before Elon even tried to do anything to fix it by forcing an advertiser boycott, causing him to fire 75% of the staff to reach cash flow neutral, which then the left used to call him a monster.You can't repeatedly punch a guy who fixed your house and put your kid through college and expect him to keep his mouth shut. And then to call him some sort of racist/homophobe/evil capitalist trying to destroy America as some fascist when literally the definition of fascism is government control of private companies by groups of people fascinated and preoccupied with notions of racial supremacy and authoritarian rule that has restricted free speech (literally the current Democratic platform), is just insult to injury. The fact that people give friends of Esptein a pass like Clinton and Bill Gates, and support companies like Apple that build phones in sweatshops with suicide nets just to call Elon Musk a crazy person who is immoral and losing his grip on reality is just rich.

Look at what's happening in the world & the economy.The facts are that Tesla is now a profitable company, will it always be that? i don't know. But people are still buying their product, ALOT of people. If Tesla had no plans or interesting products for the future, i would heavily consider cashing out.

No one is talking about the analytic machine Elon just bought to pair well with people who aren‚Äôt immediate Tesla users. It‚Äôs easy to downplay someone who is constantly portrayed in the media as ‚Äúradical‚Äù but in reality you are listening to the media, which is completely bought and paid for. You don‚Äôt have to be far left/right to realize that over the past couple years everything that we indulge is bullshit. If you watch CNBC daily then yes you should most definitely sell right now. But if you got the cajones and nothing but time it‚Äôs a value play. What I‚Äôm really looking forward to though, might be the cherry on top, is driving my cyber truck 3.0 on Mars. Now that‚Äôs gonna be cool.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:00:21'] Thank you for sharing. Interesting that the post talks about brand importance and share price levels but not a single time was there mention of being overvalued. Did you not feel like Tesla was overvalued at any point of holding the stock? If Tesla was valued at say under 8x, would it incurred the drop it did this year? Doubt it. Value is value and investors will care very little who the CEO is or what he does as long as there are results and growth. Tesla rate of growth and innovation has peaked and future growth looks uncertain. Add Elon antics and you have what you see today - overvaluation and brand destruction
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 01:27:36'] I think two things are more and more clear:- Tesla is vastly overvalued and personally I don't think they have a long term future. They managed to get there first and push EV development forward - but they haven't managed to transition into actual normal operations - polishing existing models periodically, improving QA etc. - Elon Musk is pretty bad at most things he do - but he had 1-2 things going for him: He was really good at getting investment money (in the super low cost period that is now over) and he was able to attract competent people to actually run the companies and do the technology development. He *did* have a knack for getting into exciting future sectors. But that's it. He is actually a shit manager and decision maker. And he is not an engineer, but a poser. All of that has been more and more apparent for a while. And the Twitter acquisition was just the culmination of bad judgement and big ego.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 00:59:34'] There‚Äôs that saying, nobody has lost money making a profit. And so on. But you make another comparison of founder and brand, but neglected to mention jobs and Apple. I mean, if there was ever the parallel comparison of founder and brand, this would be it. So many people had portrayed musk as the next jobs. But that ship has sailed because of another saying, you live long enough and the hero becomes the villain and that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening here. Musk has lost it and the next cool ev is not that far away, although as we speak I don‚Äôt see it yet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 21:46:23'] Musk was an evangelist for evs and that drove Tesla adoption. He created the demand and he can kill it(and seems to be working actively on doing so)The other issue is that he has now lied so many times his credibility is basically gone.Other car manufacturers got a kick in the rear from Tesla and are now catching up fast. Tesla may have been the cool vehicle to have but when you can get a better manufactured car from a manufacturer with decades of expertise it‚Äôs going to lose a lot of its early sheen. They‚Äôre trying to be the iPhone of cars, but for that to work they have to be viewed as cool and musk is wrecking that image

Elon IS the brand (I would have used Steve Jobs 10 years ago with Apple instead of Bill Gates, but whatever).More anecdotal evidence: I live in a Tesla-heavy county in Northern CA. EVERYONE I know was talking about buying a Tesla as their next car 1-2 years ago (including me). Now everybody talks about what an asshole Elon is, and how they'd NEVER buy a Tesla (including me).

His leadership skills is what impresses me the most so I honestly wish it drops to 50 so this time I can keep dca into Tesla. He is the type of leader US need most for many business. Twitter is now has least 50% less workers but is delivering the same if not better services. There is certainly less crazy bans compared to pre Elon. More and more companies are now focusing on worker productivity plunging and Elon is certainly ahead of the game and most aware of this trend for all big corps. Google, sales force and recent news in Tencent are all having reports that ceo had been much more straightforward about the alarming productivity drop. This iteration of democrats are taking america to a hellish path with their policies.

I let some expire yesterday and didn‚Äôt resell for this coming Friday close like I have done for years. My shares are free but I‚Äôve lost a cyber truck and a model Y in the last 5 weeks. That doesn‚Äôt sit well. I was the biggest Elon fan and  Supporter. Losing a couple hundreds grand is a couple hundreds grand. I don‚Äôt have Elon billions. It‚Äôs not going to break me but I invest for retirement and passing my investments to my kids to help with their life. I‚Äôm not into supporting  some rich dude playing online and costing 100‚Äô000‚Äôs of us lots of money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 03:01:56'] I'm honestly also one of those people you're talking about OP. A very long time ago even before Tesla started gaining any traction & before it was in the news all the time, I discovered Tesla and told a lot of people about this amazing car I really wanted.Then I started to follow Musk on Twitter and realised for myself what a POS he was even before the sub incident so stopped following him. Then the sub incident happened and Musk started to slowly snowball into an even bigger POS and as he grew bigger my interest in wanting a Tesla became smaller and eventually I no longer wanted one.Then a good friend invested in them and very quickly turned into an obsessed cultists just because of how much money it made him, and eventually convinced me invest too. I managed to put my morality a side for a while, but whenever I was going to sell at the top he convinced to hold on, and I did not because I believed in Tesla, but because I believed dumbasses like him would continue to pump it and I was in it for the ride.Then at the beginning of the year the markets started coming down and I finally managed to pull out entirely while taking some profit, and kept contemplating whether I should invest back into Tesla alongside the others, but my morality just taking even bigger hits as Musk had turned into one of the biggest c**ts on the planet.Now just like with Facebook I longer want anything to do with Elon & Tesla. I got rid of Twitter because of him too (though I physically can't log back in to delete my account) and I just hope my friend's sake he'll wake up before he loses everything.There's only one small thing I disagree with though in your view, and that's that Tesla can never shake its association with Musk. I believe it could eventually but it would take a very long time after he's no longer involved. As you said now when you mention Bill Gates a lot of people do still think "Microsoft", however when you say "Microsoft" most people no longer think "Bill Gates" (aside from maybe those who still believe he's the richest man in the world).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 00:42:36'] Wise decision to get out now . As long as you are holding cash. You could always get in again anytime when there are potential. As of now , the pyramid scheme is fucked . Who know when it will goes below $58 . But it definitely it will keep going down and even more down after Q4 earning call. Elon may be planning to build up the pyramid again in 2023 -24 that why he said he won‚Äôt sell . So if thing goes well like he planned , you can get in again otherwise be happy with your 180% gain . You are way better than some folks that got in or DCA when it was above $280 . Elon had already cashed out those folks money . It may be hard for them to cut theirs losses. But who know , may be next week some of those folks will do Tax-loss harvesting. Coz they may feel the same way that you do and that will absolutely drive the price even lower and faster .

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:05:51'] I've noticed the general perception of Tesla's go from "wow unique practical EVs and luxury supercars" to "just like all the others, but with Elon Musk."I'd also say this perception change began in late 2019, accelerated during COVID, and then exponentially accelerated in Summer 2022.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 22:51:12'] Has Been Real for me for the last year. It was fun to learn about the future and have faith in a company with such big ideas and opportunity, but it hasn't been real fun. It has gone up since I bought it. That is not why I invested; I did it because I believe in their mission and product. The bad news is that Elon Musk will continue to damage the brand because of his personal opinion on things, including climate change. Right now, this is not a big deal to me because I do think they will get through this difficult time and will have solid growth going forward, but my confidence could very easily be hurt if they are unable to execute well or if they cannot execute at all. Tesla's stock price hinged on the self-driving car market. I'm not sure what the prospects are of them building a monopoly in this space, but that was a major reason why I was comfortable investing. If they cannot execute well and they lose some time to competitors they will have trouble growing as quickly as they need to. To answer your second point, yes Elon Musk is a big advertising asset for TSLA. He is an amazing leader that has made incredible strides in the development of battery technology and has improved the efficiency of cars incredibly through Tesla's design. However, Elon Musk is also a big liability for TSLA. He is the face of the brand, which means that the people who are considering the purchase of a Tesla and those that already have one will be influenced by his antics, including his expensive tweets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 23:13:21'] I‚Äôm in the same boat, in a more modest way financially. I see the brand as fundamentally damaged. It may be that Musk himself already knows this, and a darker answer might be that he knows too hence the broken sell-off promise. Re the brand, Apple has outlived Steve Jobs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs doable with the right new leader. They also have huge production capacity and should be able to discount hard if they have too, but then they should/would be priced like other car companies, and you also have to factor in traditional things like costs to do new models etc. (Apple doing an M and A on Tesla is back to $60 would make a whole lot of sense‚Ä¶)I think you made a good decision.

Absolute worst time to exit a position that I've seen in 3 decades of investing. The stock is certainly likely to rebound in the relatively near future, it represents so much innovation and intelligent process alpha. Now is the time to be accumulating Tesla in small amounts over regular intervals, investing is a marathon not a sprint, no one can call the bottom - or the top.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 04:39:37'] Totally agree. Couple of years back when i was thinking about electric cars, i was thinking tesla. Musk has always been arrogant and had some stupid tweets. But he used to stand for something. He told in every interview that his point was to accelerate towards renewable energy. He was just a smart nerd, who went arrogant after being succesfull. But nowdays with the resent couple of years erratic behavour, it seems like the guy is on some strong drugs. Messing up billion dollar companies. Promising to stand for free speech but two weeks later banning all his personal foes. You never know when he has a moods to fuck up a whole company in one week. The point is elon ruined the tesla reputation for me just like he created it years back.

The issue so many retail investors have is psychological failings. They‚Äôll sell a stock that‚Äôs a great stock to own because it‚Äôs up slightly, they‚Äôll refuse to sell shit until its broken even because of an anchoring bias. They‚Äôll become wed to a company no matter what the reality because they‚Äôve somehow become a groupie of it. Emotion kills returns and retail is full of it.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\nTesla stock ($TSLA) has gone downhill in the wake of a shaky earnings release last week.\n\nThe EV player has seen its stock tank about 18% to $154 since its first-quarter earnings release on April 19.\n\nThe share price slide has wiped out about $87 billion in market capitalization for Tesla. Tesla\'s market has dipped below the $500 billion mark, currently resting at $487 billion.Year to date, Tesla\'s stock is still up 24%, compared to a 5.6% advance for the S&P 500.Investors are probably locking in on several issues that have swirled around Tesla in recent days.\n\nThe initial is a bad first-quarter gross profit margin miss. Wall Street pinned the blame on Tesla\'s steady drumbeat of price cuts in the quarter.\n\n"Let\'s call it like it is: Tesla delivered mixed results with solid demand metrics, but the elephant in the room is softer margins," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.\n\nCEO Elon Musk did little to stem margin concerns on the earnings call.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 03:38:37'] Why it rallied so much yesterday is also confusing, has it bottomed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 05:17:56'] As margins compress valuation has to come down. Makes sense that the stock has sold off after the earnings report. However, for those longer term investors this should come at no surprise and make you more bullish. Why? Tesla has been following Ford's early 1900s playbook and will continue to do so as they move down the cost curve to capture market share.>The real breakthrough came in 1913 with a proprietary innovation, designed by his production managers: the move from batch production to a continuously moving assembly line. The effect of simplification and scale was to move the price of a Model T down to $550 by 1914, when 248,307 of them were sold. By 1917, the price had fallen even further, to $360, with the result that sales soared to 785,432. In 1920, Ford sold 1.25 million Model T's. Compared to 1909, a price reduction of 63 percent -- to almost a third of the original price of the Model T, which was itself a good fifth cheaper than comparable cars -- had resulted in a sixty-sevenfold increase in the number of cars Ford sold.>Simplifying made the company's cars both easier and cheaper to make. And the price reduction was enormously effective in boosting the whole market as well as Ford's share of it. By 1920, his share had soared to 56 percent, three times larger than that of his nearest rival, General Motors, which was an agglomeration of five different car brands. Ford was by far the most profitable car company in the world, both absolutely -- relative to sales -- and relative to capital employed.>Even Henry Ford himself was surprised by how much demand responded to the lower price. A price reduction to 35-40 percent of the original price boosted sales by more than 700 times. **The fact is, the relationship between price reduction and demand expansion is asymmetrical. If you cut price by half or more, demand rises exponentially -- by tens or hundreds or thousands of times.**Any of this look familiar? Tesla is moving from the continuous assembly line to a [deconstructed process as shown here](https://images.app.goo.gl/Mehurhib5Yhr1Ckf6) which will further reduce the cost and time to manufacture. Yes there will be short term pain but the long term story looks bright
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 11:04:52'] Analysts are thinking short term. If you invest you should be thinking long term (and look at what Tesla reported in that light)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 06:04:54'] The Brinkman quote is why. Tesla is just a car company, and it‚Äôs entering a price war during a turbulent economic period. You don‚Äôt want your money invested in a price battle, ever. The other car makers are zeroing in on good or better products, Tesla can‚Äôt compete with high end cars, and the low end makers are choking its reach.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 12:12:05'] As someone that‚Äôs up 3000% from holding throughout a decade, it‚Äôs finally time to keep buying more so I can profit off toilet paper hands like you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 16:45:08'] The only thing holding Tesla in the market cap it‚Äôs at right now is because the have a massive back order. If there is any hint that growth has slowed and there is no longer that back order, Tesla becomes valued like any other car company, and that‚Äôs a p/e closer to 11 and not 61 where it‚Äôs at now
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 18:01:02'] I can‚Äôt believe the same sub is entertaining this idea that would have been laughed at when this stock was at $1100. You‚Äôre supposed to sell the stock *before* it drops 50%, not after. The fact that people here only question their holdings when they go down isn‚Äôt surprising but the rapid shift in sentiment is crazy. I‚Äôm also surprised how many investors make Tesla all about Elon and will make buy/sell decisions just by what he says. Kind of confirms the cult theories.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 16:11:03'] I'm gunna be honest, you should have sold when Elon did. If you're still up that much I would sell it all personally. This is going back to 160b market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:25:12'] Elon just sold 3.95b, I would say follow
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:21:54'] Honestly all the noise right now between politics and the economy cant go on forever in my opinion.  Twitter is a new toy for Elon and everyone is watching him play with it right now but that too will get boring and attention will eventually focus elsewhere. Meanwhile Tesla will still carry on not just surviving a downturn in the economy but growing and expanding through it. I‚Äôm up way more than 300% and don‚Äôt need the cash so I will continue to hold and add to my position when the opportunity arises.  Long term will be fine. If I needed the cash short term I would have sold long before all this twitter nonsense.  So really I would say it depends on the individual.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:06:35'] I‚Äôve held TSLA for around 7 years. I‚Äôm totally sick of Elon‚Äôs shit. That being said, this isn‚Äôt the best time to sell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:25:32'] No. If you are a long term investor the answer is no.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 20:20:56'] If you hold Tesla and are still up, kudos. I would bail.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 09:36:15'] The time to sell was when it was over a thousand dollars.And this is coming from someone with most of my buys between 140-195.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 00:30:43'] Thank you for everyone's comments. Really appreciate all the different perspectives. Just a dislcaimer: In 2019, I made a post asking about investing in Elon. Kinda a similar thing. It was near Tesla's earnings. Literally the entire board borderline called me stupid for considering investing. I did invest, well, the rest is...you know. I don't listen to Reddit with my financial decisions. Though I consider everyone's perspective in making these decisions which I value alot. &#x200B;Thank you all. &#x200B;I'm holding.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 03:51:43'] This is the beauty of how Elon has positioned himself. He has a cash cow in the suckers. I am convinced he could just set up a gofundme and there would be an army of rubes that would throw cash at him.Elon's actions surrounding Twitter has put the rest of his businesses at risk. It is as simple as that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:57:45'] The world can finally see the level of stupidity this man exudes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:12:00'] Do you believe in Tesla‚Äôs mission? Or Elon‚Äôs? Tesla‚Äôs fundamentals have not changed. I wish I had more cash to add my holdings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:05:24'] I lost money and cut my losses on Elon. Money has to align with your beliefs. Put it in a drink company I like which has been less chaotic
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 18:35:59'] You held through all of the last few years and want to sell now that the CEO is trolling people harder than ever on a platform he now owns?Tesla long term has a lot of potential. Not to mention the fact that they were recently upgraded to investment grade which will include large investment groups buying up shares of Tesla over the next 18-24 months. Look at what happened to Apple when they became investment grade. Look at quarterly profit for Tesla vs Toyota last quarter and how many units each delivered. If you can honestly look at that and can't see the writing on the wall for Tesla's growth over the next decade then idk what else to tell you. Look at the ramp their energy division is going through. Tesla is the leader on many fronts and will become the largest market cap company in the world.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 16:44:53'] At the risk of sounding arrogant I'm gonna call you out a little bit and say this really has nothing to do with Musk. Sure he's unhinged but if you felt comfortable about the fundamentals of the company it really wouldnt matter. You're being too influnced by the price of tesla all together and you need to take the emotion out of this. The only way to do this is via a grounds up valuation for the company. A basic rule I think you should use is to assign a reasonable estimation as to what true value of the company. If you can't do this for Tesla then I think that in it of itself says something about your position. If you have a rational argument built on basic facts and numbers then you'll know what to do. Do you think Tesla is worth $5 trillion? That's what's required for you to 10x from here. Do you think it is worth $1 trillion? That's what's required to double your money. If you don't know then you're certainly taking a big risk without knowing your odds. It's a matter of working backwords, how much would a company have to make to be a $1 trillion company? How long would you be willing to wait? Personally I'm more interested in opportunities that are likely going to 5-10x. Since I think 5 trillion is a bit of a stretch barring some more market mania (which is unpredictable) I'm going to other opportunities where my confidence level is significantly higher.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 16:46:13'] Fundamentals haven't changed, and while there will be a long and rocky road to get up to the $400 days again, I do think the current valuation is rather too low to sell at.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:53:37'] It‚Äôs a personal choice but sounds like you made it. Why stay invested when you don‚Äôt trust the company
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:03:02'] I sold 90% of my position almost miraculously at the ATH a year ago and reinvested in stocks/ETFs which aren't currently doing that much better but which I believe have much better long term potential. I'm not selling the remainder because eventually ( I mean decades) the stock price will recover, whether that be from Elon being replaced by someone competent, buybacks etc.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:18:42'] On a technical level alone, I believe we can see Tesla run to 250, 260, maybe even 270 in the next TSLA bear rally. With that being said, if you no longer feel like it‚Äôs a prudent investment and the company is no longer in line with the reasons you invested in the past, it‚Äôs up to you whether or not you exit. Remember that there‚Äôs no such thing as a bad profit. Don‚Äôt hold until you‚Äôre in the red, especially if you have the urge to get out with massive gains.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 16:59:58'] My guy, if ure 300% up then you were right about Elon way before anyone else. I personally thought he was an asshole when he fake-cried in this armstrong interview and then I thought Tesla was going to 0 in 2019 when he publically stated that they have only weeks to live and lied about the $420 offer.&#x200B;If you saw through all that and made money off of it, I cant tell you what to do. To me, this compaty was dead 3 years ago. You see things that I dont and I appreciate that. You do you my dude.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 15:29:27'] You have diamond hands. Have you checked their latest ER? Anything to not like? I suspect you do not like how the media interpret the price action caused by the institutional traders moving funds around and benefiting by scared paper hand retail? It is ok to take some profits though. Kudos for holding up to 500%. Hope I have enough bravery to hold that long. Started to buy now when fin media is creatively finding the narrative to justify the selling. They are great at that. Just watch how their messages change when it reverts:) "Elon was punished, Tesla gains back the investors confidence". LOL

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 16:56:23'] When it appeared as close to certainty as we see in the market that equities would go down in 2022, I decided to preserve profit from picked stocks by selling out of all of them to put everything in VTI. This resolved the ‚Äútime in vs timing‚Äù issue by keeping me in the market, but diversified to mitigate pain. After some damage had been done, I sold some VTI to realize loss while buying picked stocks (JPM, GOOG) which had fallen farther than VTI. This allowed me to preserve some cap gains via tax loss harvesting, while also saving multiple % on the way down. You may consider a similar move, selling out of TSLA to go into VTI. If the market runs violently on CPI data, you‚Äôll capture that. If it tanks, you‚Äôll be diversified and take less damage than you‚Äôd likely absorb on TSLA in that scenario.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:32:35'] I got Tesla at 70 pre first spilt  and traded like a mofo through all the ups and downs. Sold another bunch recently at 300 looking to get back in. IMO Twitter is a distraction now, we have loads of companies that pander to the left people have been hating on Elon as he spouts some right leaning words I wish all business would stay out of politics (of course they will continue donations ford and Gm cover both bases but give more to dems) I‚Äôll hang on to a good portion of Tesla for another 10 years as I‚Äôm playing with house money it is confusing times for a lot of things regardless
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 17:41:14'] Nope. Keep buying and sell weekly otm Covered calls. Every 100 shares you can get $400-600 per week.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 19:17:19'] Similar situation to you and I‚Äôm thinking about selling some off myself. The next year does not look good in general atm for most stocks. Do you feel like you need the cash at the moment? Elon sold over the past few days so there‚Äôs a chance that it may rise for a bit before the next fed meeting. There‚Äôs also been a push for a buyback by investors as Tesla is sitting on cash and is profitable every quarter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 19:20:12'] Owning a Tesla car (I don‚Äôt), they say, is an experience. Own Tesla stock (I do) is a much bigger experience. FWIW, no one can predict what would happen to the stock. It has never traded on fundamentals.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 20:45:44'] I sold most of it late last year at $1,182. I kept a smaller portion but told myself if he ever sold shares again for Twitter I‚Äôd sell the remaining shares and I‚Äôll do that in premarket. Can‚Äôt trust his word anymore. I honestly wish he‚Äôd step down as CEO. I love the company and he‚Äôs slowly but surely tarnishing the brand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 20:51:27'] come to your own conclusions.if you think bad management is going to cause the company to falter, maybe that's an indicator that you should sell. or maybe you look at the financials of the company and despite musk's bizarre personality traits, decide that it's still undervalued and has a lot of growth left in it. you need to ask yourself why you bought the stock, and more importantly, the piece of the business that stock represents, in the first place. if your choice to buy wasn't based on logical, sound investment principles you might hear from peter lynch, bufett, or munger, then what difference does it make if you sell now. no different from leaving the poker table while you're well ahead.but it would be foolish to leave the table if you know the odds are significantly in your favor if you stick it out. and you can only find those odds by doing your analysis of the company and determining the risk parameters you're willing to accept. you should have determined them before you bought, but if you're up 300% you're still in a great spot to do that analysis, belatedly, to see where things stack up now.i'll repeat my usual advice: go read all of peter lynch's books, and munger's, and mary buffett's Buffettology. by the end of those, if you don't know whether you should hold or sell, well..
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 20:53:22'] I am just going to explain it from a different perspective. The company is great (in fact, the best on execution) but the valuation has never made any sense. Autos are interest rate sensitive. Rates are going up. As rates go up, the tolerance for high P/E investments not performing or executing on their guidances drops. And let me tell you something, the rates won‚Äôt stop going up for a while and they will stay there for a hot minute. Now ask yourself, if you are holding at a monstrous gain, one of the most nonsensical valued investments and the macro backdrop is literally going back to the good ole high interest rate times, shouldn‚Äôt you be locking in most of those gains? I certainly would; unless you know something we don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a fantastic company but it‚Äôs not the best time to hold it. This market is unforgiving and cares about margin stability and shareholder yield flow through - it will largely punish any negative news and will have strong resistance on the short term uptrends. This is what I would do. If I added this at a weight of 5% on my portfolio, I would rebalance the position back to 5%. If the stock continues to fall, invest back in at a relatively sensible valuation. At this moment, it‚Äôs trading about 4x the SP500s forward P/E. In this market environment and macro backdrop, that‚Äôs dangerous.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 23:21:45'] Hahah cant believe there are comments here telling you not to sell because "the fundamentals are still good".The fundamentals are absolutely terrible at this price. TSLA is still vastly overvalued, before you even consider the absurd amount of key man risk associated with Musk.300% is a rare thing of beauty. Sell now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 23:23:19'] Back before the split, when Tesla was around 1000 a lot of people here argued about the valuation. I remember a lot of discussions were any doubts about Tesla were not only laughed off but aggressively attacked.One risk pointed out back then was Musk. Usually it was not his erratic behaviour (though that came up) but for example some medical stuff that would render him unable to lead. I didn‚Äôt go into Tesla because I was unsure about the stock, especially with a very high seeming valuation and unclear metrics in the future.Now I‚Äôm asking myself if I would not invest if Musk wasn‚Äôt CEO and majority shareholder and at below 200 that is probably a yes but I still most likely won‚Äôt because I don‚Äôt TRUST MUSK. It isn‚Äôt so much that I don‚Äôt like him (though I think there are ample reasons to dislike him - at least politically), but I try to not make investment decision on personal issues. However his approach to selling Tesla shares he got as options for his ventures, him alienating a lot of potential customers, the lack of new developments in the company (not unlikely because of success with already existing models paired with distractions by other projects)‚Ä¶ just don‚Äôt make it feel right to me.Therefore I could understand you, OP, if you cashed in your gains.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 00:07:31'] Well, Elon was saying for years that FSD is around the corner, so very few people expect FSD to be anywhere near now, but I think that we might be really getting close to FSD in the near term. 10.69.3 is a big improvement, just compare it to what was 1 year ago. I'm not saying it is ready as is but there are now 3 million Tesla's driving on the streets and sending data from their cameras and Dojo is really around the corner to give Tesla the power to process all this data. And really FSD doesn't need to be perfect to be legalized (I mean legalized to drive without the driver, just passengers) - it just needs to be safe enough. That means that taking suboptimal route, going to slow, stopping on the street (given its safe) or even scratching a parked car is not a no-go for FSD as these doesn't endanger anyone, they are just inconveniences, suboptimal comfort or damages that needs to be payed. If the trade-off for them is saved lives, and Tesla would be able to prove it, then I think FSD legalization might be quite close.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 00:08:19'] I bought 10 shares at $250, 2 splits ago. Turned about $2500 into $50,000. Sold half in 2021 and my remaining shares last month at $289. Best investment I‚Äôve ever made. But I don‚Äôt trust the stock to stop falling. Get out with your money.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 06:41:33'] TSLA is likely to converge towards the other auto makers valuations, so I'd be inclined to take the money off the table. Reality is also catching up with TSLA - it's just announced its 17th recall this year. There will be more to come - not that it's a specific criticism, rather a fact of engineering life when you are in the early phases of a (complex) new product and speed to market has been the priority.  Also, I suspect there will be a TSLA share overhang, as more will need to be sold to fund TWTR costs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 11:06:26'] Even though much of what you say has merit, I think you underestimate how stupid of moves he has made lately.  He didn't just say something controversial, he put his company in the middle of a political war that has very high emotions, and sided with the side who do not like electric vehicles, almost to a violent level.  He also proved he was an inept leader with Twitter.  Unless he steps down, I think Tesla has permanent scars.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:18:55'] Didn't Elon predict potentially an eps of 0 in the next year? Reduced margin, reduced volume in all markets.If that's true is that built as a bear case of this model?You have not speculated on the fallout of brand destruction due to becoming increasingly unhinged on Twitter, and specifically toxic to liberals with money, his primary sales demographic. Let's say 1 in 10, 2 in 10, or 5 in 10 customers are now compelled to choose a competitor; how does this affect Tesla's ability to generate revenue and profit?Your bear case is very mild. If even 2 in 10 customers are turned away and gross margin drops by 50%, this is starting to become a calamity. There is potentially far more risk that this post assumes.There are many anecdotal reports of people embarrassed to drive Tesla's or are no longer interested in buying. The evidence will be in the next 2-3 quarterly reports.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 15:30:37'] Why invest in a company that is now split by political ideology? Regardless of where YOU stand on the political landscape, it's about the consumers buying the product and if half of them aren't buying it because they don't support extreme right ideology means you split the market in half. IMO, TSLA is the worst investment to have, to be holding, to get into. I rather invest in a company that caters to everyone. Also, the clock is ticking. Manufacturers are catching up to EV. TSLA is no longer the only manufacturer anymore and it's hilarious to think otherwise.In addition to manufacturers catching up, battery power and infrastructure isn't catching up to speed. I highly doubt the EV shift is happening at the designated time frames they desired it to be here at. It'll prolong ICE and make TSLA harder to invest in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:03:27'] good bear case.  I wouldn't buy unless its under $20 a share.  its a car company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:22:20'] I can sum this up much easier: Elon pissed off his leftist base by buying Twitter. Tesla is going down much much more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 09:53:52'] I cant help but think there are enough funds that are counting on TSLA price not to drop much further.. but I've been wrong before. Add to that the fallout if it did happen to drop another 30-40%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:45:09'] A good company does not mean it‚Äôs a good stock. I think Tesla as a company is executing and the last few years the stock was overbought just like everything else. Look at all mega tech and high PE companies. They are all adjusting their earnings and cutting staff. I think I heard it at the Compound and Friends but they likened Tesla to Cisco from dot com. Cisco was and it still is a profitable company but they never reached their ATH due to a ridiculous high valuation it had during the bubble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 12:57:02'] The cars are superb (QC issues notwithstanding).The tech is outstanding.Their rapid recharging infrastructure is the literal archetype of an ideal charging network.They've pushed legacy manufacturers into finally developing ground-up EVs.Unfortunately, their CEO is a bellend. I'm glad I sold my model 3 last October. I had to get a van (electric) anyway, but everything Musk has done over the last 3 months has made me ashamed to be associated with the brand.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:32:11'] High quality writingGg
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 17:55:58'] I‚Äôm not even going to add on Elon‚Äôs recent moves. This breezes over the fact commodities required to produce these cars at a scale of their growth with more competition in their space is going to drastically reduce profit. This is before you factor in the actual cost of ownership for consumers as ESG policies are showing cracks with pressures on grids and consumers being asked not to charge cars. Honestly, I think Elon knows the game is over. Maybe he thought it would go on a little longer but with interest rates high and inflation still a problem I‚Äôm very skeptical we will see Teslas or it as an individual company in the long term. I think Elons twitter acquisition was a way to stay relevant and move into a space which isn‚Äôt levered on low interest rates. Something which could still help his passion with space exploration. Whether he will cut his losses and sell or it will be forced to close is something I can‚Äôt predict. I think recently you‚Äôve seen his interest is not in Tesla anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 06:26:09'] 26% CAGR in Revenue expectation 2025 is a bit laughable, as the energy sector just begins to pick up speed and the car business at least for next year should already grow by 50% again, which means the following 2 years would be below 15% growth. My expectation for rev growth would be around 50%, 40%, 40% until 2025

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 12:54:32'] Dude, "open your butthole" creates zero buzz. What edge lord buys a $50k car to have that option? Fart mode? What about the miserable detail quality like panels that break off with a slight pull? Or rubber seals that barely hang on the door frame? You didn't even mention the slew of lawsuits the company is facing such as the self-driving feature plowing into people or the car accelerating wildly!There are a lot of things that Tesla has done, or is doing, that has been positive. Selling directly to consumers is awesome. Disrupting the automative industry that was a slave to fossil fuels and forcing automakers to consider EVs is great.But it's painfully obvious that the stock has been over-valued for years and this market correction was necessary
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:12:15'] Tesla paid for infrastructure and their factories when price for them was at an all time high. In contrast, Toyota acquired and built most of their land and fixed assets for factories after WW2 for literally nothing.Your first mover advantage for self driving is overstated. Tesla has spent the last 3 years developing self driving for cars without LIDAR or even radar. They are now behind Volvo and even Cadillac in this area. They also counted deposits for FSD as revenue without having delivered anything close to what was promised. This revenue should have been counted as unearned revenue, which is actually a liability on the balance sheet. Alot of what Tesla has done from an accounting standpoint is going to bite them in the ass, because it contributed to their stock valuation.Tesla‚Äôs moat and competitive advantages are vanishing quickly as legacy auto continues to move slowly but surely to catch up, taking as little risk as possible. There are huge headwinds for Tesla, and the added burden of twitter is coming at a very bad time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 13:59:56'] So tired of the TSLA bagholders. You guys were wrong, plain and simple. TSLA is a car company that can fall another 50% at least from here if (read: when) we enter a recession. The rest is just copium/hopium. Cut your bags.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:09:52'] Great analysis, very comprehensive and well done. Quick question/note, I assume the below is a typo - should be "cost disadvantage"?>You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost advantage, how do you cut them out of the deal?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 15:15:00'] I really like this analysis - and I think you did a decent job to balance bullish and bearish indicators.For me the sweet spot to enter Tesla would have been below 100$ per share as I find it highly volatile and hard to predict where it will go (which is why I stayed clear of it so far - for bad and good depending on time). I‚Äôd maybe rethink if it hits 112$ now, or 110$ because of your analysis.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 20:13:32'] I got in at 48, I got out at 82.  To say the entire market has been a volatile shit show since 3/20 is the understatement of all-time.I will say this though, since I started viewing the SPX as the U.S.'s capital account, things do make more logical sense.  The reason TSLA hasn't gone down more than it has (and likely should if traditional TA matters at all) is AAPL.  VOO and SPY and all other SPX derivative funds have not seen marked outflows to the level commiserate to what the Bond market has to say about liquidity.  TSLA is in the SPX.  AAPL is being used internationally as an inflation hedge and as a defensive domestically.  Ditto the other top 9% of the SPX weight (look at how it breaks down).  But not to the level of AAPL.If I told you the SPX was a derivative of its top 5 companies and that they made up the vast majority of exposure of almost any investor in the stock market would you believe me?  If the SPX is the US capital account, then the derivatives are all just planets around the highest weighted corporate suns.As such, TSLA is a riskier derivative of the same pot.  I would be a buyer under $90, but I am out of it at $99.  Unless there is substantial adjustment to the SPX between the time I buy and the time I hit my limit.The only stocks I have real determination on right now are auto parts stores AZO and ORLY precisely because of the increasing complexity and interest rate sensitivity of new car sales.  Plus so many people are underwater after overpaying for used cars that they will all end up on the road until they are beyond dead.Even then, I won't grow my existing positions in my taxable account unless I get assigned on puts.  There's far more money to be made in CSP's right now than actual ownership.  The volatility range is tight.  GEX and VEX have been pretty reliable indicators on setting your prices.  SKEW ticked higher before this upcoming dead week.  And I wouldn't mess with TSLA on options anyway, even though there is a MOUNTAIN of puts right now.  The SPX is volatile enough.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 00:38:10'] TSLA is still valued like a tech company despite only having a fancy autopilot. Over promising and under delivering are the two thing Elon Musk does the most regarding the companies he owns. January 2017 he said FSD would happen within 6 months. November 2017 he said a Tesla semi will be on the road in 2019. 2019 he said 1 million robo taxis on the road by 2020. Tesla will remain a car company selling cars, and it will probably not be able to justify its current market cap. There‚Äôs too many other choices for EVs and hybrids that people are choosing over Tesla now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-28 20:35:45'] Tesla FSD is not going to get any better any time soon. Robo Taxis were just a Pipe dream. Tesla is currently valued roughly 7x a regular car manufacturer.

The fundamentals *are* changed; you have someone who was a large part of the brand who is going full into politics, which risks alienating a large part of the audience (and it clearly feels like that has started to happen.) This isn't anti-Elon, it's just the reality: the CEO of a consumer facing company with the political environment being what it is tweeting the kind of stuff he's tweeting is an enormous negative. What good does alienating a large part of the potential audience and impacting the brand do? It's a lose/lose. This doesn't get into valuation, competition or other issues.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:00:10'] if the "business fundamentals" were running the show then the stock price would still need another 75% haircut, get real kid. If you think the current price looks good then you're looking BACK at the idiotic bubble valuation, not FORWARD.ü•¥
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:07:35'] Aside from the valid points of what others have mentioned (APR increases, core customer alienation, increasing competition), I'll offer a personal experience. This is anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt.From 2012-2021 every colleague who has purchased an EV purchased a Tesla. In 2022 I know 7 people who purchased an EV. Two ford, Two Volvo, One Porsche, Two BMW. Another friend is in the process of buying a Hyundai.I think Tesla is seriously overvalued. I'm interested to see where Porsche prices their upcoming Macan EV. I'm guessing that'll eat into Model Y sales if Porsche can keep production up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:30:13'] From a fundamental perspective the stock is still quite pricey. While it's far more attractively valued today than it was two years ago, you have to put that in the context of a stock which has traded purely on hype and sentiment for a long time.With that sentiment shifting, what allowed the stock to trade far beyond its fair value for years could now become a negative driver of the stock price. If sentiment towards the stock turns negative then it could easily trade below fair value which could price it around $70-80 imo.TSLA was the first stock I ever brought in 2012. I invested largely because I admired Elon, but a couple of days ago I realised I don't really like him anymore. And it's not even the political stuff, it's the arrogance and the constant lying that I can't respect.I've said for a long-time that if TSLA ever drops back down to my price target I'd buy back in (sold in 2020), but I don't think I would now. The company isn't doing anything interesting and I'm not sure I like the CEO anyway.If I owned it I'd at least be selling a chunk of it because there are plenty of great deals out there right now. It makes no sense to hold on to a stock with questionable sentiment and fundamental drivers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 20:19:30'] My biggest concern with Tesla‚Äôs stock is the loan Elon has taken on it keeping the stocks as collateral for buying twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 11:13:24'] Tesla is no where near it's bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 13:05:39'] I will say it again and again. This was yet another example of cathie wood hype. Granted the company is profitable and has real FCF so it‚Äôs far better than the others. But prices are still out of whack with fundamentals. It‚Äôs still not fairly valued by any means. The auto industry is very cyclical so think about what happens to sales going into an economic slow down (even if we don‚Äôt have a recession). If you factor analysts estimated 5 year CAGR (mind you analysts are always over optimistic) this stock is still overvalued. Learn to do valuations folks prices always revert to the mean for real businesses. This ain‚Äôt a ponzi schema (cough cough crypto‚Ä¶). Please don‚Äôt blame Elon for buying overpriced shares - that‚Äôs on you if you chose to do that
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:35:17'] Honestly based on his personality and the growing distaste for him.  People when buying their next electric vehicle are going to be more inclined to just buy one of the tens of other options.   The market is insanely saturated now.  Any manufacturer can come out with some new battery tech. All of them are working on self driving.  There really isn't much of a moat left.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:10:36'] The fundamentals of the company have changed just due to the overall costs of borrowing to obtain a vehicle are increasing and Tesla isn‚Äôt really cost effective yet‚Ä¶..   More companies will move into the EV space and yes it will get more competitive.  So that is a factor as is margin compression.But to your concern that the Elon storm will pass I am not so sure.  38 percent or more of Tesla buyers are registered Democrats.  Taking just the liberal or anti-Trump label that increases.   The EV market overall is 41% Democrat to 27% Republican.  Also most Tesla and EV buyers identify as Miilenials and Gen-Z.    He is systematically destroying demand from the groups who buy them most.   He is seen as the Kanye of cars.   Kanye album sales since September are down 17.5% worldwide, radio play dropped 13%.  But really his popularity has been declining steadily since switching into a blatantly political position that is the opposite of his fan base.  Elon doing what he is doing is like Garth Brooks going Chris Gaines and this moment really is a Howard Hughes or probably more accurate Gerald Ratner moment for Musk and Tesla and I think the damage he is doing is being grossly underestimated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:34:38'] The fundamentals were the problem in the first place. They didn't match the valuation unless you price in incredible growth and domination of an industry that it has yet to accomplish
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 14:11:41'] IMO ...Disclaimer: I hate Musk with a passion and have hated him since the pedo comment, but lost my downpayment as I stopped the Y purchase recently. I went against the purchase because Tesla and others were not willing to give me my fair value for trade in. Tesla has several big problems. They are a premium car without premium features.1) Self-driving:  There is a lawsuit about this and Tesla's response has been that self driving is a goal and aspiration. Meaning they really have thought on how to bring this out as a product. As they are re-introducing the radar it means their vision basis is not working. How long till they have to get lidar and map? Who knows, but one can say that their self-driving is not something that will set them apart.2) The Tesla system is an OS all on its own. Carplay? Autoplay? Not a chance meaning either I get Spotify or I have to use old bluetooth audio, which truly sucks. I rely on Google Maps for all of the information and there is none of that. Meaning a premium car system is not premium.3) Their cars all look alike. My wife can't tell the difference at all. The models are also getting long in the tooth. Meaning they will need to do a massive reinvestment in tooling, etc for the next product line. As there is no future plans to redo their cars people will look at their cars and go meh...4) The styling has nothing special. If you look at the various car makers they have little gizmos and extras that attract people. With EV's turning into the smart phone you will need special features to distinguish yourself, and there is nothing there.Tesla had an early competitive advantage, and that is it. There is no second round. Heck I am surprised so little is talking about the Tesla Semi. This all tells me that TSLA (if it survives as a stand long company) will have a valuation compression. I can't see this going up.I also would like to highlight I have not commented on the shite show that is called Twitter. If you look at the stats there the "woke" crowd that has rejected Musk and Tesla, but the "MAGA" crowd have not decided to buy Tesla's.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 13:46:50'] I replied to a similar thread months ago about why I was bearish on Tesla.https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wpd59m/tesla_valuation_multiple_is_lower_than_amazons/ikgee0f?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:21:18'] Tesla is forecasted to have the highest revenue growth in the entire NASDAQ 100 (index of large cap innovation/growth stocks) at 39% in 2023, yet Tesla‚Äôs forward P/E of only 35x is not even in the top 10% of that index. And that‚Äôs based on analyst estimates for revenue and earnings, which have consistently underestimated Tesla basically every quarter for the last 2 years. Analyst estimates for Tesla‚Äôs 2023 earnings are up 46% over the last year, and I estimate it is still 20-30% too low of an estimate (unless there is a very harsh recession in 2023).This has happened before - Tesla grew their business extremely fast and manifold while investing heavily, yet the stock price was basically flat between 2014-2019 before it finally exploded in 2020/2021 to account for the massive growth that hadn‚Äôt been priced in. Now Tesla stock is flat for over 2 years despite growing revenue 164% and profit 17x. The hive mind consensus in r/stocks that Tesla is still overvalued is wrong, and the people who say that either haven‚Äôt paid attention to Tesla‚Äôs growth trajectory, are way underestimating Tesla‚Äôs future growth trajectory, or don‚Äôt understand how to value growth companies.Hold through the noise, and in the long run, the market weighing machine will determine TSLA stock price to be much higher than where short term voting machine values the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 14:25:24'] I've never understood the growth projections on Tesla. How long can a car company post 50%+ y/y growth? Software companies I see. You can make endless copies for nothing. Cars are expensive and time consuming to produce. They also require a lot of lead time to expand capacity as you have to build factories, build out supply chains, etc.  At some point, possibly soon, even if demand keeps growing, you just can't produce more and more cars quickly enough to sustain that growth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 13:12:43'] No.Tesla's fundamental business has never been why the stock price was up. It's been all hype. All sizzle and no steak. Tesla is the original meme stock or "shitcoin". The company benefited tremendously from gov subsidies, which it won't receive at same levels any longer, and the Elon hype train has left the station. Now, let's just look at the company itself. 1. Models across it's lineup are looking extremely stale as competition from everywhere ramps up. Model 3 and S look extremely boring and dated at this point. 2. Tesla cybertruck will be a massive failure for a number of engineering reasons. Flat windshield is a Highway pebble's best friend. Uncoated aluminum exterior will look awful after weathering. Dimensions of truck are awful. Yoke is stupid as hell. Truck will be nowhere near 40k as originally promised. Likely closer to the Price of model x (north of 80k).3. Tesla semi is a joke and highly uneconomical. This will pay out horribly. 4. Musk will likely need to dilute more shares and will likely declare bankruptcy because of twitter. 5. We're heading into a recession and people will forget about saving the world. Many many more...
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:08:50'] Tesla was always overvalued based on fundamentals. It's just falling to fair value now, as the Elon premium is disappearing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 13:30:51'] I‚Äôm holding through the noise as long as Q4 looks as good as it should. Slight miss on deliveries ~40%, ~50% rev growth, ~100% income growth is where I‚Äôm estimating. If Q4 really underperforms it could mean a tough time, but I don‚Äôt expect the recession to start showing until Q1-Q2. Teslas double edge sword is growth. It has a high valuation because it‚Äôs growing extremely fast. The more you grow the higher the pe, but if tesla stops growing at these speeds it means the stock is overvalued. People are expecting it to slow growth due to the recession as well as other short term noise like twitter and Elon selling shares. This is why the share price has fallen, it was also disgustingly overvalued at 400. I think the stock will continue to fall short term, Q4 will be another record giving them and even lower pe leading to a bit of a bump and then more flat. Longterm, the company will be worth more than it is now.Also worth noting, is investor sentiment. Everytime you talk tesla **everyone** says it‚Äôs terrible, still overvalued, going to 0$.. but if you said that a year ago at ath it would‚Äôve been the opposite. People generally don‚Äôt actually know what they‚Äôre talking about, so use what they say as information (after fact checking) and form your opinions based on that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 13:22:53'] No, it was extremely overvalued (and still is). It is still priced for pure domination in the EV space, but the truth is that its EV market share in more matured markets (Europe and China) is already shrinking month by month for years now. Their 'Full Self Driving' tech is basically the same (maybe a little bit ahead) compared to most big auto makers driving assistant, just look up the EuroNCAP driving assist tests. Sure, Tesla is the first, but there are like 13 other automakers with cars that have over 90% scores. I think that the valuation is just starting to come back to Earth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 14:10:18'] I think Elon Musk's recent pivot to conservative ideas and conspiracy theories have the potential to hurt Tesla a great deal. Teslas is/used to be the darling status symbol of urban liberals. Their cars are at every corner in the DC area where I live. These same people are increasingly alienated by Musk's newfound politics. They also tend to be the people with the money to buy premium cars. I don't know that conservatives, who often live in more rural areas, will start buying EVs to the same degree. Add to this the fact that other players with big brands and deep pockets (like Porsche) are rapidly catching up, and I don't see Tesla as an opportunity at all at this moment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:21:22'] People who are down at this price are in serious trouble.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:27:21'] What business fundamentals supported their absurd valuation? The share price is finally coming down to reality.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:59:45'] My two cents is something fundamental has changed. Teslas eye watering valuation was based on elons ‚Äúeccentric visionary‚Äù winning streak (and not business fundamentals). Do you think Elon is a laser-focused visionary still?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:22:16'] Yup. Shut out the noise , it is hard.  Buy on fear sell on greed
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 19:36:43'] I highly doubt Tesla will reach a new ATH this decade. Elon is a wack job and other car companies have started eating Teslas lunch. People are beginning to not fall for Elons empty promises !RemindMe 7 years
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 21:04:39'] The market cap is still 530 Billion and the p/e is something like 50. They have no business being as big as they are. Every manufacturer has a line of electric cars now and more models are coming to maket all the time. Look at the other major manufacturers, they almost all have p/e of under 11; hell stellantis is a 50 billion dollar car company with a p/e under 3, making 40billion gross and 4 billion net per quarter and they are paying out a 7%+ div.As far as tesla, the business fundamentals haven't changed but they were never as good as the price and hype would have you believe. They are facing challenges with their AI, they have an Elon problem, they are facing almost 4 million recalls this year. An ok company, not an ok investment
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 02:52:42'] Tesla is a speculative stock. Meaning put your money in and consider it all lost for peace of mind.Tesla valuation is very high already. It's market cap was greater than all the other major car manufacturers combined. Tesla is by no means that big. I put some money in tesla. Enough that I didn't care about losing it. And now just don't care about the stock in general. If it goes up, great I made money. If it goes down, not that big a loss.A lot of people treat it like an actual stock when it is a meme stock and a lot of the valuation is tied with Musk and his antics.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:47:05'] My thesis is that TSLA will be the "iphone" of the EV industry. Other competitors may beat Tesla in battery range, better AI driving, etc but none will have the complete "package" like a Tesla. Like iphone, Tesla will always be the "gold standard" to which all other EV cars are compared to.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:32:57'] ‚ÄúFundamentals‚Äù if you were trading on fundamentals in the first place TSLA is the last stock you would touch. It‚Äôs headed to sub $100 in these market conditions

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:46:08'] The fundamentals never existed. I am so glad I exited this when musk started all his shenanigans. He is going to be the next Kanye....
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 13:34:04'] I think demand, at least in the US, possibly even Europe (where it is small to begin with) is in the process of falling off a cliff. Depends if you think their China business will pick up the slack imho. I think China would rather sell more Chinese cars. I think Elon has lost it completely more or less, and wouldn‚Äôt touch the stock, but for mostly personal / political reasons (investigations, recalls, and culture war BS don‚Äôt help either).
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:45:13'] I've been buying the dip heavily.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:47:54'] i think tesla has suffered irreparable damage, meanwhile hyundai has been focused and has created a low cost alternative ($20k) and will find a lot of interested buyers with all the stigma elon has created. tesla is no longer the best new iphone, it‚Äôs a really expensive trump car
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:57:09'] Larry Ellison joining the board was the best possible thing that could happen to Tesla stock. Larry Ellison leaving the board has been the worst. People don't see the effect he had on musk. He basically was the one guy who could get musk to stop being a child because musk respected him. He made his money and he's out. Sell.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 22:04:16'] Sit in a fucking tesla if you want max FUD. What a fucking shitbox interior. It feels less premium than a lowest trim corolla and the suspension feels like garbage, my friend had to get rid of his because  his dog would get sick riding on it. They try to make you think they‚Äôre premium with their shitty ass door handles or the big obnoxious screen. Now that theres competition catching up with proper build quality shit will hit the fan real quick as people catch on really quick.As for their self driving segment, its mediocre and you can trust me in saying that no robo taxis will come out of there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 01:57:44'] Tesla has been exponentially overhyped by Elon for years, who's nothing more than a  glorified hype man for his companies (with the exception of Twitter, he's really managing that one and we can see how well that's going).Now that the public is seeing what a gibbering idiot he is, pricing is going to collapse to more reasonable levels.Elon is doing his best to prove has either \*nothing\* to do with the managing/engineering/design of his companies whatsoever OR he's hands on and fucking everything up (Twitter).  He seems to be determined to prove your average Starbucks manager could manage companies better than him.&#x200B;Sell.  Cut your losses.  You should have sold a long time ago.Elon was seen as the "high priest" of tech stocks for so long that anything he hyped got built up massively.  That's all going to be tumbling down for years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 02:12:46'] Fundamentally it has always been shit. So you‚Äôre right..it‚Äôs still shit

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 13:56:54'] Big automakers have been taking more and more market share from Tesla every year for past three years.  I like Musk, but he is too erratic for me to invest my money in his companies.  He is more interested with his vision for the world than making money for shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:31:37'] Warning for OP; this thread is filled with misinformation. Do you own research and stick to the company's financials. You'll make a lot of money instead of regret your decision in a few years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 15:30:38'] Price was too high for business fundamentals 4 months ago‚Ä¶ and continues to be too high today‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs 150$ stock‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt buy above 120
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:29:19'] All the noise aside. IMO, Tesla makes a mediocre car. I have a BMW iX that has better range, a nicer interior and more charging options without using an adapter. Tesla styling is stale, every new version looks like the same old Tesla from the last 10 years. The new Audi, VW, BMW, MB, all have EVs that can rival the tech and range of a Tesla. The range on the Mercs are stupid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 19:27:58'] After driving a few non-Tesla EVs, I‚Äôm not so concerned. The inability to drive a well equipped EV for a long distance trip like Pittsburgh to Chicago is a problem for any of the other auto makers that want to dethrone Tesla. Yes the tech will improve but the supercharging concept and ability to overcome range limitations is something other auto manufacturers haven‚Äôt come close to touching yet. Btw, even Tesla‚Äôs smallest range battery is enough for these long distance hauls. I had some hope with the Mach-e but that was one of the biggest letdowns. A few of my friends got the credit and flipped it for a model 3.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 23:51:40'] Tesla is undervalued at this point. I honestly don't understand how people can look at the fundamentals and think otherwise.Conservatively, you're looking at a 2023 PE of 30-35 for a company that is still in the early phase of rapid growth.Yes, Elon is a nightmare. Yes, margins may shrink, but they will continue to sell more and more vehicles for the foreseeable future, and they have a major new product (cybertruck) ready to hit the market by the end of 2023 most likely.I will be stunned if the stock price is not higher a year from now than it is today. 2024 PE is probably around 20.  You will not be able to find another well established company growing this fast at that cheap a price. Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:48:44'] lmao TSLA was never worth the premium it had in past 2 years. So many people on youtube were hyping it as next best thing to humankind. Always made me cringe.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:56:16'] O boy TSLA and fundamentals don‚Äôt go together. It‚Äôs way overvalued less overvalued than when it‚Äôs pe was triple digits but still overvalued. TSLA was always stock in Elon not the cars, if that relationship changes TSLA will be trading below 100 in a hurry
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 17:34:42'] 1) The stock has always been over valued. It always priced in the growth and the company realized that growth already.2) Elon‚Äôs salary is basically ‚Äúinverse buy back‚Äù.Basically stock dilution3) The richest man‚Äôs riches are in Tesla stock. So every time he needs money, the stock will fall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:08:30'] How is TSLA not doomed?   Take a look a twitter- over night it's become a MAGA fuckfest.   Musk has really hurt his brand.  If he doesn't shut up an move on from politics   he will lose a lot of buyers.    Tesla is quickly become the MAGA hat of cars.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 22:28:59'] I own a Tesla. I plan to trade it in shortly. I will never buy a Tesla again. I have no desire to enrich a master troll. Maybe there are others like me perhaps fundamentals are different.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 03:08:30'] You're right the fundamentals haven't changed, they're still shit like they always were.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:10:27'] Tesla is a case of selling at prices not supported by the numbers. Heavy speculation drove the price well above fundamentally sound ranges. Not it is settling in to ranges the numbers support. Once settled it will climb again just not as high

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 16:59:31'] Has Tesla in the recent past ever traded on fundamentals that make sense? I will concede it's *beginning* to look attractive, sorta, but technically it looks to be in freefall and still hella expensive. Might be fine as a long, long term hold but there's a lot of people who would say it still represents little upside even from here.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:16:26'] To me, the value of the stock was closely tied to how the public viewed Elon. With that out the door and more and more people turning on Elon due to Elon doing nothing to win people over, I wouldn‚Äôt touch Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:17:35'] Elon‚Äôs tweets aren‚Äôt noise‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs permanent demand shock. It‚Äôs getting priced into the stock now. Don‚Äôt catch a falling knife.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:27:08'] Personally I would hold. What goes down comes back up and what goes up will go down. It‚Äôs almost at a 52 week low, so just hang onto it. It might potentially go lower, but it‚Äôs bound to come back up. Never panic buy & never panic sell. Biggest lesson I‚Äôve been taught with stocks & crypto. Personally- that‚Äôs what I would do. I‚Äôm not a professional, but I‚Äôve dealt with stocks for a few years and obtained Tesla over the years as well.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:43:56'] Teslas basic asset valuation is based on how many people are currently worshipping at the church of Elon.  As he falls so will the stock price.  Also established car brands are chipping away and eroding teslas market share. Being first to market isn‚Äôt really important in the EV ecosystem anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:53:27'] He is shitting all over the brand, that doesn‚Äôt translate to their fundamentals???
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:54:13'] Remember that new factories, margins and production numbers are far more important than Dave Chapelle & Fauci.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 18:54:25'] There's an argument to be made that TSLA is way overpriced. If it is, keep Elon for now to push the stock price down. Yes, Elon is kind of insane. Definitely a narcissist. Not sure if Twitter will work out.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 19:27:05'] It‚Äôs alright, they have 1 million robotaxis on the road since 2020 and the Optimus sex bot is gonna take over the world, and they‚Äôre on track to hit 20 million annual deliveries by 2025. The fundamentals are solid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 19:30:33'] What‚Äôs crazy is this was entirely predictable even as it was happening. Like there was no ‚Äòhindsight is 20/20‚Äô. Foresight was 20/20 as well. Always question the hype. Tesla even went beyond that to a point of absolute mania. Tesla is only now being valued correctly and it‚Äôs probably mostly because the GME crowd have largely exited the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 19:33:12'] Were there ever any fundamentals?Elon‚Äôs popularity fueled Tesla‚Äôs stock price. Elon has made a lot of promises he didn‚Äôt deliver on, and has engaged in actions that have caused his popularity to take a hit. Combine that with the market in general, and more refined competition, and you get this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 19:51:21'] I dunno, I mean on one hand there‚Äôs a lot of institutional ownership and it technically is a part of  the sp 500 index. On the other hand, it‚Äôs falling back to reality along with the general market cooling.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 20:33:39'] In the long term, probably. If Elon is a liability, they'll eventually force him out. If you believe in Tesla as a company and not just as Elon, you might be able to weather the storm. In the medium term, he's a liability because as other companies get their EV production up, people have to decide if they want to have the car associated with Elon. And EVs are much more popular on the left than right so he's going to lose a lot of US sales if he keeps getting more faschy.And if institutional investors decide to bail, it could get ugly.In the short term, seems like the market hates it obviously.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 22:01:57'] TSLA has formed a cult. If you are a buy and hold TSLA you believe in the vision of full autonomy, self driving, and future technology products in line at Tesla gigafactories. If you watch their shareholder meeting Tesla is a company that does more than just build cars. If you believe Elon Musk will deliver on his shareholder meeting speeches you better be buying at these levels. If he doesnt, well that is the risk you take buying individual stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 22:23:18'] Fundamentals should pull price down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-12 22:30:03'] TSLA is just going back from INSANELY overvalued to still overvalued. Also as you said ELON is more and more mentally unstable and he is tesla, thats why its valued that way.I am not a buyer and wont be unless either it goes much cheaper. Maybe 120 is something i would look at. Or musk doesnt start to focus on important again. And not tanrum posts on twitter.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 01:34:46'] It‚Äôs funny how people have been so critical of teslas valuation on this sub, but during the pandemic people peddling carnival cruise and amc stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 01:34:56'] Tesla is all noise.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 01:36:06'] Teslas fundamentals wont be known until we finally have enough competition in their segments to gauge how they hold up. Its also wait and see if they can successfully compete in the truck segment. Its important to point out that management is a big part of the fundamentals. Discounting it is a bad move in the long term.Right now its still highly speculative. Tesla guys say one thing and bears say they are all wrong. I invest long term, 20+ years out, so this is a no for me but it might be ok for others.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-13 04:50:45'] Tesla stock has never been about the fundamentals. It was so hilariously and astronomically priced, it was like it had the next 25 years of growth and profits already ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù. A car maker selling under a million cars a year who was worth more than the top 10 automakers combined, who sell 30 million cars a year. It was pure stupidity. Nothing Tesla was doing isn‚Äôt something any other car maker couldn‚Äôt ramp up and do themselves in 24 months, which is exactly what we see happening today. There are 4 automakers who will sell more EVs this year than Tesla, all 4 of which combined sold fewer than 100,000 EVs 3 years ago.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 02:52:33'] Honestly, I'd be more worried about the Chancery court case that is going on right now. All of the Twitter fire is working perfectly as a diversionIf you have a chance to read into Musk's testimony on Wednesday, cross in particular, oh boy. Also Antonio Gracias's testimony.It gives the impression that Tesla has a completely nonfunctional board that is pampered by Musk and does his bid. That things are either Musk's way or the highway. And even more worrying, the testimony of the other people close to Musk has been quite eye-opening in the fact that they cannot clearly state what even Musk's contributions to the company are. They all state he sleeps on the factory floor, and amazing management style and so on, but the plaintiff's lawyer on cross has been pointy and specifically asking for specific contributions of Musk to the company, and no one can give a straight answer. The whole "genius engineer" meme is falling apart badly.So yeah, Twitter is a distraction to another fire, from which TSLA will sure suffer. Twitter itself is being salvaged now by more private endeavors, there is a reason why it was SpaceX buying ad space in Twitter and not Tesla (where Tesla would have made much more sense)Then again, don't short cult stocks
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 13:36:56'] What collapse?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-17 22:56:56'] Out of the $44bn paid, Elon contributed $25bn cash, $5bn other investors and $13bn of debt secured on Twitter (not on Elon). No effect on TSLA but Elon style should raise corporate governance red flag everywhere else.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 02:50:31'] Twitter is probably going to be done at some point soon at this rate and it's too bad.Elon thought that he could demand people be "hardcore" and that they'd all fall in line; it's one thing to sell people on a mission of saving the planet (Tesla), it's another when it's Twitter and demanding "hardcore or leave" works out about as well as it would if this was a "Silicon Valley" episode.  Additionally, they apparently offered a few months of pay and benefits. If people in the company thought that the company was heading for disaster and they could get benefits now and leave or get nothing when the company implodes, a lot of them took the offer.Apparently, a number of them just hung up during a video conference when the deadline for choosing to stay or leave rolled around. Elon was still talking - https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1593405187745619975I think the Twitter fiasco takes attention away from Tesla and should give people who worship him some pause. Eddie Lampert took over a decade to destroy Sears and literally slow walked through trying to tear the company apart piece-by-piece in order to try and benefit himself. Elon is basically speedrunning his attempt to destroy Twitter and how that is to his benefit I'm still not entirely sure.John Legere - the guy who turned around T-mobile and did a pretty spectacular job at it - tweeted at Musk that he would run Twitter. Musk's reply? No. Why in the world wouldn't Musk want someone like that ASAP?IMO, the Tesla-related concern is also the politics. Telling people who to vote for when you're running two consumer facing companies is an absolutely insane thing to do in this day and age.As for Twitter, I've thought for a long time that it would be better off in someone else's hands - 1) apparently not Musk's and 2) maybe that time has already passed; this is a much more unforgiving environment and you've now saddled the company with more debt and seem to have no plan, even tweeting that the company will do lots of dumb stuff in the coming months and will keep what works and drop what doesn't. That...doesn't sound like there was a clear plan in mind to begin with and given the state of the company, "try some stuff and see what works" is not going to work in this environment for very long. Musk basically came into Twitter acting like he was going to make things up as he went along. He's already spooked brands, which isn't great when your business is primarily ad space. Subscriptions? Apple gets a big part of that. With what Apple did with advertising and iOS, it feels like the social media business was impaired to some degree before Musk bought. Facebook's attempted Metaverse pivot is because they have to.If the easy monetary policy of the last decade or so is truly over for many years to come it will be interesting to see how Musk fares.TLDR: Nothing about the Twitter fiasco has been positive for Musk, from the distraction of it, the lack of a clear vision for Twitter, the speed in which it seems to be falling apart under his leadership and there's nothing good about it for Musk "the brand." Also, for someone who has something like half a dozen companies, he has a lot of time to tweet - he's Tweeted so much more since buying it. Buying the company at all was not a good idea but there was no reason Musk needed to be the face of the company - he should have had someone else as CEO from day one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-17 23:14:37'] Elon will be very distracted by Twitter over the next 6-12 months (maybe more). Many are obviously and rightfully worried that his attention to TSLA will be negatively effected, so yeah, I would not be longing TSLA while this fiasco is going on. There are way better plays in the market to be buying the dip. Selling calls and buying puts probably the only logical plays.TSLA competitors will take this opportunity to inch a little closer to TSLA‚Äôs lead. Just hope that Elon doesn‚Äôt have anything else take more of his attention away (eg. family issues, SpaceX, crypto, etc.)
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-17 22:57:30'] Of all the reasons to be short TSLA, Twitter going bankrupt isn't a great reason in my opinion. Is he personally messing up TSLA? Or is it just running in the background as always? Maybe he just has some personal beef with Twitter's existence.I'm getting the impression of someone who isn't actually spending much time doing day to day management of his companies. Which is perhaps a good thing if you think the guy is unstable. Also there is probably a different culture at TSLA than at Twitter, where from the very start he was inflaming tensions with employees.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:37:22'] Am I in the minority here? I see this as a HUGE buying opportunity on TSLA. I would just ignore short term noise and look further ahead. You're literally buying in at the lowest price in the whole year at $178 as a support level. But of course, no one is asking you to throw in your life savings on TSLA. Just saying that it's a good price to get in now, and DCA if needed. Even if you're not long TSLA, this is a good short term swing trade. Buy in now and sell after $200.With the huge demand I see in Asia where I'm currently living, Teslas DOMINATE the road here. Just open and see with your own eyes. If I don't see a huge amount of Teslas on the road, then I would be bearish on the company. But that's not the case here.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:15:51'] Twitter isn't going anywhere. Either the Twitter engineers were complete idiots and it can't run unless massive amounts of engineers are constantly monitoring it, or they were good at their job and created a resilient system and they can use a lot less engineers while they *aren't* actually changing the system and assessing how they want to move forward. I choose to believe the people who wrote the systems and maintained it were at least competent in their job and it will be fine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:21:30'] I‚Äôm not sure if you should believe these headlines. They are making it out to be (in my opinion) worse than it is.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 10:35:18'] I don't think they are going away and people are overreacting a bit. If he ends up needing to hire more people, he'll be able to find plenty of talent that are more aligned with his vision and won't commit insubordination publicly.  Twitter employees had a certain culture and that culture didn't jive with him, so he's cleaning house. Better for all parties in the end.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 08:02:00'] Everyone makes it seems like a large amount of high end companies aren‚Äôt this dysfunctional. You just see this through the looking glass because Elon is uncaged at times and overly transparent (not with all, obviously).All this news coverage makes it seem like TSLA is the one black sheep of the C suite business world.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 11:44:48'] Twitter isn't collapsing. They are better off without all those additional people.Nothing justifies 7.5k head count in Twitter when the product has barely changed in the past several years. Instagram had 13 employees when Zuckerburg bought it. Many tech companies are overpaying people for underperformance and Elon is having none of it.Twitter can continue with the current system with 500 or so people. They will need to ramp up for building new features but as ad revenue is down and a recession looming, it's best to cut expenses and just keep the lights on until the economy recover.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 05:58:42'] I don‚Äôt think Twitter is going anywhere - right now it‚Äôs usage is at a all time high. Contrary to popular belief, you do not need 7,500 people to run a bird app and Elon knows some of the smartest people on Earth who would help get it up and running if need be. This is a lot of noise over nothing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 06:19:23'] It's not like Elon owns 100% of Twitter anyway. There are investors that took risk + invested in Twitter privately. He doesn't need to pay back all the loans -- just the loans he personally took out.  Twitter's culture was messed up. He is getting rid of it and most of the employees. The restructuring and new engineering to make the product better is key. Twitter could probably be run with 100 employees.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 05:09:42'] I think it‚Äôs showing everyone who Elon really is. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôve thought he‚Äôs the second coming of Jesus or the most evil man on earth, he‚Äôs done something in the past few weeks that leaves you at wtf.

America business icon Jack Welch was one who fired 250,000 Americans during his two-decade tenure ‚Äî earning the nickname "Neutron Jack" . Before Welch, employees were considered a company's greatest asset.  Under him the employees, general managers all are expandable like commodities.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 09:28:17'] All this commotion about Twitter might genuinely cause TSLA stock price to go down. My bet is that he‚Äôll make a separate fund or lease the office space in the meantime. Their edge might be software after all & the total value per share might only matter to the traders who‚Äôve been waiting for the price to go down. I wouldn‚Äôt sell so eagerly just yet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-18 06:04:01'] I am a total Musk fanboy and for good reason. I think Tesla will be fine, if investing for the long term.No doubt twitter has been a shitshow. Probably not as bad as being made out, but it's bad.I think Musk miscalculated the difference that arises between managing a population that joins a company out of passion and with knowledge of the deal, and a company you take over where people didn't join for you, don't share your values or work ethic. He had to take a risk, and looks like it went further than he hoped.I am quite upset by the entirely unneccessary fck ups though. Blue tick abuse should have been the first thing you build for before roll out. I think too much on his plate is affecting his judgement and if twitter does fall over quickly that may not be the worat thing for tesla.

POST_TEXT: b"Strong Q4 earnings and the possibility of producing up to 2 million cars this year helped add to Teslas recent gains. The stock closed nearly 11% higher on Thursday after already breaking the downtrend resistance stemming back to September at the start of the week. \n\nThe gap higher does leave some room for a pullback on profit-taking from here, especially if Fridays inflation data raises bets for a hawkish Fed decision next week. However, trading volume has been relatively higher around the recent lows, including Monday's breakout, potentially signalling strong demand at the current levels. \n\nAll trading involves risk, but the stock could begin a more sustained rebound if the strong earnings report, and Elon Musks comments on demand and output attracts longer-term investors."

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 03:28:26'] I vaguly remembering someone says gross margin will be 20%, so net margin will be around 10%?That is a considerable drop.  My guess is Q1 eps will be around 0.8.  and eps will gradualy increase every quarter when they ramp up production.  that is my guess.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:06:02'] Until people get tired of it.  Back to historically high?  I think not.  Most tech folks still want to make bets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 04:11:45'] Dude, are you for real? They have massive margins on their cars, they have $22 BILLION in cash and the software used in their cars is the real cash cow once they‚Äôve got FSD working. They are still at least 5 years ahead of anyone out there in the ev market and once they have FSD working well and start their taxi service, they will be unstoppable. So long story short, Tesla is a $1000+ stock play once they have all their factories running at full capacity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 10:18:29'] Tesla is king of the hill in the EV market.... just as AOL, Yahoo, Netscape, etc., were once kings of their own hills. There's obviously a lot of life remaining in Tesla, but they will be facing increasing competition from the majors (who have dealers that can service and repair their vehicles). TSLA is still a good short term opportunity, but it won't be able to sustain its premium P/E indefinitely, so it's not a good play for buy and hold investors like me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 06:59:44'] tesla is going to 100x from current prices so yes a mere 200% gain is nothing. 2020 it only 10xd we have alot more to go up
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 22:22:12'] Why did they drop prices 30%? Certainly they don't think they can financially out muscle the car industry in a price war, so why?The answer to that is likely the answer to your question as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 00:51:48'] That was a terrible quarter, this one will be worse and that earnings call was an absolute joke
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 23:43:27'] The market doesn't make sense in a more general level. It's funny how banks and media often describe what's obviously a short squeeze as a fundamental change in the economy.The stock market will have support as long as the passive inflows are as strong as they are.Tsla is going to be short squeezed, and yes, there are also fundamental reasons why we're off the 120s lows.Thing is, the whole auto industry is reeling. I would not take any positions in TSLA and short it if it goes above/near 200. It's just too expensive vs. competitors. Consider the (very poor) measure PE. PE for Tesla is around 50 and for Wolkswagen it's around 5.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 06:14:39'] Margin will drop significantly. They may be able to keep up production growth but not without continuing price drops or introducing less expensive versions of the Model Y. They only have one car that most people want (Y).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-15 22:40:20'] Let me get this straight, Musk liquidating his shares for x amount does not mean the total valuation would drop only by x amount. Total valuation i.e. market cap is only latest price multiplied by amount of shares. If I sell 100 TSLA and it cause the shares to move by 0.1 cent, i am actually causing more losses in terms of valuations, than the actually proceed of the sale.

Well well Tesla, I thought you had another buyer? They‚Äôve been playing games for too long. Self driving coming next month! Prices coming down soon!

POST_TEXT: b'Everywhere is reporting that Musk now has a "massive windfall that dwarfs any bitcoin losses" due to the sale of the TSLA stock to fund the TWTR deal, and as that deal is no longer going ahead, he\'s pockets the cash.\n\nI\'m then reminded that some shrewd analysts suggested that the divorces of Bezos and Gates to their wives were actually cover to sell massive amounts of stocks without causing a run on their companies (Founders selling huge chunks of stock usually causes investors to shit it but can be explained away for personal reasons).\n\nI\'m starting to think that Elon knows he\'s got a tough road ahead, the golden days of Tesla stock price are behind him and he\'s just liquidated massive amounts of stock at what will seem like a really high price in 10 years from now as all the big car manufacturers finally catch up and dilute Tesla\'s only real advantage (being first).\n\nEDIT: wow, RIP my inbox and thanks for all the comments. \n\nOne comment in particular really seems to confirm the above'
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 14:18:49'] Makes no sense, if this was his plan he could've done a non binding deal, an IOI or LOI even to give him cover to sell TSLA shares in an explainable way then he'd could back out of the deal with either no penalty or a relatively "small" penalty.My theory is he's just a complete idiot when it comes to investing (in the buy existing company sense, not in the hey let's start a new company to revolutionize an industry, obviously he's pretty great at the latter) and thinks that just because he runs successful companies he's a genius at everything he touches.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 11:34:55'] Yes, it was obvious. Recessions have a massive impact on stocks, especially ones with a high P/E such as Tesla, which is a luxury brand in the tech sector. It absolutely disgusts me how people fawn over a conman who takes share holders for a ride
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 11:31:17'] If it was, it was both a terrible idea and a terrible execution
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 14:41:06'] It was just stupid. If Elon wanted to get rid of the stock he could have. He didn‚Äôt need an elaborate facade.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 12:30:28'] He doesn't need to "hide" his stock sales. Executives are paid mostly in stock they sell their stock for liquidity it's normal. Microsoft's CEO basically [sold like half his shares](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/30/investing/satya-nadella-microsoft-stock-sale/index.html) last year and no one batted an eye.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 13:36:49'] Cmon people. Use your head. He can sell his stock whenever he wants and he reports it. Why would anyone want to get stuck in possible multiple years of lawyer BS and court litigation for a dead buyout deal. He has sold his stock before and its not a big deal. No one in their right mind would attempt a dead in the water buyout deal just to sell a few billion in stock. Just stop. The twitter deal is dead because Twitter has lied to the SEC and its stock holders about how many real active users they actually have.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 20:56:02'] Probably. Instead of keeping holding such an unsteady stock in a recession, a way to back out a large portion of the position without straight up saying that he doesn‚Äôt have faith in the company long term. He‚Äôs a massive rug pull. Look at dogecoin and crypto in general when he said Tesla would accept it, only to back out after massive gains due to ‚Äúenvironmental concerns of crypto‚Äù.

Watch him PUMP AND DUMP IT at a higher price while trolling about buying it! He's CLEARLY not going to buy it, just manipulating the stock smh send him to jail.""Elon made an offer to buy Twitter? $54.20 is a JOKE. Literally has 420 in it! WAY TOO LOW. He's BULLYING the Twitter board to accept a low-ball when it should sell for in the mid-$60s AT LEAST. Watch Google/FB come in and out-bid Elon to buy the company!!!""There's a poison pill? Elon WANTED that to happen so now he can announce he'll dump all his stock at a PROFIT and create a Twitter competitor! What gimmick PR.""He actually bought it??? Well...Elon and Jack Dorsey colluded to force a gun to Twitter's head and agree to acquisition of $54.20. Billionaires play by their own rules. Elon's evil.""Elon's trying to get out of the deal? Clearly this whole thing was a way to sell Tesla stock cuz he KNEW there was a recession looming and he can time the market because he's a fortune teller. Who cares if he lost some money from his ownership of Twitter stock?"Seriously.Keep hating on the man behind two companies that are fundamentally changing the world in some of the most significant, societally important ways. I'm just going to keep watching my wealth grow from my Tesla shares as I have since 2013 and will keep doing the next decade while I read threads about whether it's "too late" to buy Tesla stock when it's $6000+ (pre-split).

He's going to pay a $1B fine plus whatever the most expensive lawyers in the world cost to hide selling his Tesla stock, which he wouldn't have to disclose until after the fact, right after he just sold a huge stack 6 months ago AFTER ANNOUNCING THE SALE BEFOREHAND.And he's doing this in the quarter before Tesla's two new factories will come online that will each be larger than their two current factories combined, and they'll go from $5.5B in net income to $25-45B next year. What a genius move!

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 14:41:16'] That was 8.5BHe sold 16B a few months earlierHe did it all very publicly, and tanked the stock price 20% or more both times.I'm not sure how anyone thinks this is 'hiding' the sale.And he did the deal in such a stupid way that all of that $ could be going to twitter (depending on what a judge in Delaware decides).He liquidated after it zoomed 50% (800 to 1243) in weeks, but no one apparently zooms out -- TSLA is up 5% on the one year chart.  Almost all other tech companies (hiring previous TSLA employees) are down 10-50%.But no, big car manufacturers are still fucked and not catching Tesla anytime soon.  Many will go out of business without bailouts.Some of them may catch up on the product features... but then they have to succeed in mass producing them... and the few that get to that point will break-even or ~~loss~~ lose money because they don't have TSLA's margins.Tesla will sell every car they can make in the next 10+ years, at a profit the rest of the industry would kill for, and they are more than doubling their production capacity in the next year (improving their 1st and 2nd factories, while ramping up their 3rd and 4th factories).But sure... go ahead and short it :)edit: some other companies will be successful at EVs, but they aren't what Americans would know as the 'big manufacturers' -- BYD, Hyundai, etc.   Ford might make it, but will spend years in lawsuits trying to get rid of the middlemen dealers eating their profits.

And the sells off were mainly the market crashing. But maybe you could be right, I could see Elon selling some position but make no mistake he‚Äôs not the cause for the drop, but maybe he‚Äôs anticipating the next drop which he should cos I think it‚Äôs imminent and soon. The sweet phase 2 phase is over and we could be in a phase 3/4
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 16:54:33'] Lol the ruse of Musk selling stock to pay his taxes was wicked - the retail hordes ate it up and bought the dip as he just reloaded and sold more shares, dip, bump, repeat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 21:08:27'] This is what people say when they bring in the preconception that Elon isnt sometimes stupid and impulsive. I think he was stupid and impulsive and might lose money. Even though I think that + value lost in TSLA might "hurt" him financially - I think he'll be okay.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 15:59:06'] Elon has and will always be Elon. He doesn't really give two shits what you think of his behavior, if the last decade has been any indication.At the end of the day does he really need to con anyone? What's 240 billion plus or minus 50 billion? Moreover you're trying to make sense of his behavior when he's simply eccentric. If anything his entire life has been one giant validating experience that he can and should keep doing whatever he likes.He essentially helped found PayPal and used the money from it to get into Tesla and other ventures, has 9 children from various methods including surrogacy and IVF, admits he's on the autism spectrum, called one British child cave rescuer a pedo and got away with it even though the other party filed a slander suit, etc.PS Tesla is about 5+ years ahead in EV tech compared to everyone else. There's a reason other companies are dumping billions into R&D and still unable to catch-up, especially regarding the engineering innovations they've established. If any legacy manufacturer could have made EVs mainstream, they would have beat Tesla to the punch already.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 16:39:07'] I don't think so. Elon's different. He's always been an honest, straightforward guy, never someone who's just out for a paycheck. He's homeless for chrissake, that's how little he cares about money. The guy is a socialist even he supports UBI and everything. Plus, he's always been honest online. He doesn't need that money, he doesn't even care - twitter is the one that kept changing the deal so of course he had to drop out. Why would he break the law so publicly? Really makes you wonder I think the internet is once again on it's moral crusade against anyone successful, probably just out of jealousy. Now the MSM has pushed the narrative that if Elon is making profit somehow it's bad, really makes you think about when he said the democrats were hell bent on destroying him just for wanting freedom

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 16:48:55'] Yeah and not to sound like a prude but Tesla as a brand has lost some of its luster. I used to think of it as synonymous with progressive high earners and now it gives off more the new money or people over extending themselves vibe.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 18:24:29'] How about his theory: Elon took the tactical route to expose Twitter for fraudulently reporting user base size and has backed them into a very difficult legal corner.Let‚Äôs assume he wants to expose Twitter for overstating it‚Äôs user base and generally just wants to kill or severely damage Twitter as is generally understood by his public tweets.So, he makes a play for Twitter. This gives him the legal right to ask them to disclose how many users are real versus how many are fake. They refuse and he knew they‚Äôd refuse. Share prices starts to dive. He starts talking about backing out, and creates a frenzy.And then he backs out. He knows what‚Äôs next - they‚Äôll start squeaking about suing. But does the board want to? Are they dumb enough? And even then, what‚Äôs the fallout if they don‚Äôt?If they sue he gets to force them to disclose real users vs bots and fake accounts. In public. In documents that will be public. If they don‚Äôt sue, the public will forever think they are fraudulently reporting numbers. Which, let‚Äôs be honest, is probably what‚Äôs happening.He gets to force Twitter to expose their secrets for very low cost this way. It‚Äôs not going to cost him the billions he thought - he‚Äôs going to do it for the cost of litigation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 19:18:40'] Easy way to settle this by Musk. He can buy 40% more stocks with the same money he got by selling the tsla stocks couple of months back.But don't hold your breath, everyone and their uncle knew that TSLA was stretched when it was trading at $1200.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 19:20:57'] Whatever it was I'm absolutely certain that it wasn't a good faith offer to buy the company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 22:04:58'] Mr. Musk exercised his options he contractually earned at the top of the market, paid taxes, sold some and now has more shares than he did previously. Rough road? Yes, all the while TSLA has a years worth of demand locked in which should get them through most of the looming recession as they scale 2 factories and have new models coming out over the next few years at the best margins of any car company and the best returns on money invested of just about any publicly traded company. He could walk out into the middle of 5th avenue, pull out his finger guns and go pew pew pew and secure 5 Billion tomorrow. In other news his stake in TSLA and Twitter are matters of public record which may or may not mean anything if there's swaps and loans are involved. As for the other auto manufactures, sure the ones from China will wreck shop however Sandy Munro doesnt give good odds on just about everyone else. TSLA does have the advantage of being first however they also figured out how to build the cars the most efficiently. Other manufacturers will have to emulate printing out the front and rear of the body in white going from hundreds of parts to 2 to match. The chip shortage will be on going for at least another year, likely 2 and not many auto manufacturers have adapted well to the challenge. The rate of physical recalls is also rather 'burn the house down' obscene.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 22:22:20'] I doubt it. He only sold less than 1% of total shares outstanding.... it‚Äôs pretty pointless.I mean, if he really cares about, he would stop tweeting those crazy things.... or at least sleep on it. His tweets does way more damage than any insider selling

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-12 22:53:06'] Would have been a great plan except he is on the hook to buy Twitter and is going to be forced to pay up. And he just doesn‚Äôt have the assets to do so anymore. He Galaxy Brained himself into losing tens of billions of dollars in exchange for the headache of trying to run a social media company.Musk is the stupidest genius I have ever seen.

We can't compare TSLA to other traditional auto companies, so its not apple-apple comparison with others.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 14:44:56'] Apart from utterly dominating the EV sphere:YoY growth on the energy side seems strong (and the order backlog is unreal..so likely to continue growing rapidly).Personally I like that R&D investments went up. Innovation is Tesla's strong suit (not only in terms of product but a company that lets people innovate is  a company where the best of the best want to work at. Long term success is made by people.)

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 16:47:40'] There's not one thing in particular that I look at, but compare what the company is doing to the models I made.Is the company growing revenue as I modeled out. Is margin changing as I predicted. More/less shares? Cash to Debt? Then, I'm looking at their product line to see if and when they are hitting milestones I think they should shoot for. For example; I knew car prices would have to drop down, and they did, just 2 years sooner than I expected. I'll have to update my model to reflect lower margins sooner.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 10:27:33'] I have only been in this sub since 1/2021. Since then, Apple has gone from $2.2 Trillion market cap to $2.6 trillion. All during the turmoil of this year. Hit $3 trillion at their peak. That is a growth company. AMD has grown from $100 billion to $160 billion. If I expect them to be $300+ billion market cap in a few years, they are a huge growth name. How can you mention Intel and shit on AMD in the same post? Lol. It is also a beginner‚Äôs mistake to think that you have to find the $1 billion dollar market cap company that will get to $20 billion. More of these will cut in half than those that 20x their market cap. **Higher risk does not guarantee higher reward.**
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 12:31:02'] If you want to see a change, then make the change.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 10:08:35'] They probably get a buy out by the big guys.The ones with the most potential tend to be the ones turning something that is traditionally analog into digital.

Everyone is looking for a way to turn that into digital. From apple watches to Amazon shipping drugs.

Some of themwere on their top and stagnated‚Ä¶.In 2000 everybody laughed with Google. Yahoo even didn‚Äôt want them. Apple? Pfft, it‚Äôs nearly bankrupt. Amazon? No chance that online bookstore would exist in 10 years. Tesla? No chance it would survive. Well, we all know how that ended. In 20 years Apple could be a shell of what it is now and another company, that exists today, could be worth like 6T. Who knows. Everyone puts their money in the top 5 biggest company‚Äôs. In the 90‚Äôs that top 5 was made out of the ones in my first sentence. Things change. The winners today could be the losers tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 14:55:39'] Smart investors stay away from the stocks ‚Äúthat everyone talks about‚Äù. The famous stocks have a high risk of being overvalued, because fanboys buy them without proper evaluation. This drives the price higher than it should be. The price could still go up if more people become fanboys, but at that point it‚Äôs like a painting. The price only depends on what people want to pay so it‚Äôs basically random. A safer way would be to find undervalued companies, which are easier to find among the small unknown companies

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 10:44:12'] Ok so what stocks do you suggest should be discussed?1. We got mega cap tech companies like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc even though are already established make a ton of money that is returned to shareholder value in the form of massive buybacks and dividends. So of course they are going to be discussed.2. We got speculative plays that blew up and are growing market share like AMD, TSLA, and NVDA. I would personally argue that the valuations make me not want to touch them. However I can see why these stocks would appeal to people as they are growing earnings like crazy and have the potential of being big blue chip companies.3. You got risky plays like META, and INTC. Me personally I am not touching them. However once again I can see why they would appeal to some people and be discussed as they are already established companies that make money but are trading at a low valuation due to big earnings loss and short term risk.4. We got just your standard blue chip dividend companies like JNJ, TGT, KO, PG, PEP, WM, etc. there is nothing really to discuss about these cause they are kind of universal buy and hold companies. They have been around for decades and have been growing stock price and dividends. So I don‚Äôt know what is there to discuss except buy and hold. 5. We got penny stocks and I feel like nobody discusses those cause of how much risk is involved in them. Most people on here lets be real have no idea what they are doing. So discussing penny stocks is not really a process and is just mindless speculation.So my question to you is which stocks should be discussed? M**e stocks were basically banned from being discussed a long time ago.

The are debt-free, freshly transformed, have a new, dedicated team in upper management that is manically focused on the long term, currently significantly outperform the SPY (even in the recent overall small bull hill) and they have an incredibly dedicated, albeit a bit weird, shareholderbase that hold, continuously buy more and register the shares in their own name (establishing a direct connection to the company and render their shares un-lendable) no matter what the current overall sentiment outside of their bubble is.People can shit on them all they want (and they even do, if you look at the overall negative sentiment and the sheer volume of negative artikels and 'analysis' on their stock) and their strategies are very much debatable, but you can not neglegt these facts. Also what's more bullish than a slowly growing community of crazily stubborn maniac amateurs who try to learn stuff and have a crush on a certain chairman?There, I've said it. Now downvote me for talking about a controversial stock in a subreddit about stocks ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 10:29:02'] A point is that historically from 1926 is that only 4% of companies stand for all marketprofits (excess profits over bonds). So If a megacompany emerges it will likely continue to be mega.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 13:52:40'] This sub downvoted comments regarding GME and many are proud to short it roughly a month and a half ago, considering YTD GME is green, as well as AMC, and sure as AAPL since 5-26, this sub is not for forward thinking investors.

It's hard to argue against these names though. They are juggernauts. That said, the top performers of one decade are seldom the top performers of the next. I too wish there was more discussion of other names as well. There are so many more interesting names on the small/mid cap side of things. There are lots of sectors outside of tech. There are lots of potential market outperform stocks, and not all of them have to be disruptive moon shots.After all that, I do my best to put some of the names I find interesting into the discussion here. It's my way of trying to diversify the discussion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-07 12:56:15'] Looking at how everything played out during the last hmmm 5 years(?) it‚Äôs almost as no matter what stocks you choose, regardless of fundamentals or anything or all went up or down about the same.  The speculation wsb stocks went crazy high but so did good companies ‚Ä¶. And the oposite was true. Everything came down regardless of anything besides feelings. As more of normies enter these trading platforms the crazier it gets. And if everyone piles up into faang then it affects everything else seems like it. As those are part of almost every etf/funds and if those mega corps come down so does those funds which affect the feelings about everything else. To me the future is in robotics. It‚Äôs a little premature now of course but that‚Äôs where the huge growth will be imo. And mid level companies in China. There will a lot more Tencent and baba coming around but it‚Äôs really hard to research them.And the issue with robotics is that the big tech companies are all over this field. So it‚Äôs hard to ‚Äúbet‚Äù in nvidia in the robotic side if they keep appealing the crypto kids.And the etf/funds just pile up the same big players that do other stuff that rely on subscription growth or ad revenue. So I‚Äôm still trying to look for good stocks in robotics and mid level Chinese companies. But seeing these huge ups and downs makes me just hold on for a bit.

It‚Äôs good to throw the fishing line in for 5-10% of your portfolio but it‚Äôs extremely important to also invest in the giants that are safe and still provide steady growth like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, etc. sure these likely won‚Äôt see 150% growth in a year but they also won‚Äôt crash 200% in a year and go bankrupt like those powerball pick penny stocks. I will say I definitely would prefer people post some of their more less heard of picks bc everybody knows which companies are safe and which aren‚Äôt. At the same time it‚Äôs just as important to throw in 5-10% of gamble picks in your portfolio bc diversification is 99% of the game.

POST_TEXT: b"Let's do some math. \n\nGiven Shanghai's current run rate is 22k per week, that annualizes to a little of 1M per year. Fremont does 600k a year, and I'm estimating Berlin and Austin both do about \\~300k next year(Run rate of 75k per quarter at Q1 and then run rate of 500k at end of Q3. That means give or take 300k total). This adds up to 2.2M next year in line with their own 50% yoy growth estimates. \n\nKell Blue Book also has the avg selling price of a Tesla in November of 2022 to be 68K. Apparently were supposed to have a recession next year, so let's say Tesla is forced to lower the avg selling price of their vehicle down to 59k. \n\nThis would give Tesla about 130B in revenue next year (2.2M \\* 59k). Assuming operating margins of 20%, this leaves Tesla with 26B in profit. Divide 26B by the number of shares outstanding, 3.468B, and you get an eps of $7.5. \n\nWhat does that make Tesla's forward PE ratio you might ask? Less than Apples.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 13:44:47'] Nope. You  are thinking the demand for tesla will be on the up and they will keep delivering 50% YOY. That aint happening in a recessionary economy. Their cars are over priced, build quality is mediocre and now their CEO is the most divisive CEO we have and no other CEO is this public who pisses of a huge part of population.I dont think we are close to the bottom. Watch that happen after earnings next month.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:09:56'] 1) You cannot calculate PE off operating margins. Net margins are 10-15% depending on quarter, so take down your earnings. 2) Margins are likely to drop as average selling prices comes under pressure. 3) You argue that Tesla is "grossly undervalued", this is assuming they continue near 50% growth. If demand dries and growth stagnates, would you still think a company growing at 0% or even 10-20%, trading at 40 PE is undervalued? I think the biggest debate is whether/how long growth will continue for.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 14:05:49'] Apple has a larger ecosystem and long-term growth prospect with a wide moat (A CEO who isn't cratering their brand).Tesla has no moat. The barrier to entry to EV is gone. The brand is wrecked by Elon. Competitors have more affordable models, some have better technologies. Can you get on the App store without paying Apple? No. Who can enter the smart phone market against Apple? Very few. Also. Don't know where your figures are from. Analyst total estimates are $5.34 forward 12 months, which is 25.8X to $137.80. Also, I'd wager those earnings projections are optimistic. Given Elon's nonsense and competition, I wouldn't expect Tesla to continue to draw the same level of premium buyers. And they don't figure a stingier consumer either.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 15:25:17'] First off, your title makes no sense. Second, you shouldn't be comparing P/E ratios of two companies in completely different sectors and using that as your basis for valuation. TSLA's P/E is more than double the industry average. Someone else already mentioned leadership stability as a credible factor. Even if TSLA outperforms, there is zero risk in not owning TSLA. It sounds like you might be bag holding..

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 15:38:37'] >This adds up to 2.2M next year in line with their own 50% yoy growth estimates.They are loosing market share in every market, slashing prices in China and you can now get a Tesla in Europe and the US in a few weeks. Backlog is gone. Furthermore, the whole car market is declining.I doubt they will sell 2.2M cars next year. >This would give Tesla about 130B in revenue next year (2.2M \* 59k). Assuming operating margins of 20%, this leaves Tesla with 26B in profit. Divide 26B by the number of shares outstanding, 3.468B, and you get an eps of $7.5.A lot of Tesla's operating margin is a bit illusionary like days payable outstaning being very high for a car maker. Also given the price cuts in China and Europe -  why do you assume they increase their margins. Let's assume 15% operating margins, so 19.5b in operating profits. They can carry some tax from previous years forward, so at a 20% tax rate that is 15.6b in profits, so that is $4.5 EPS -  and that is still assuming they can sell 2.2M cars at 59k (although I still believe they won't). If we take my still very opportunistic scenario we have a forward PE of 31. If we take a bit lower selling price or 1.7M cars, that quickly shifts. >Apple has a forward PE ratio of 19.55. If you are excited to buy Apple at these prices when their -25% off ath, but won't touch Tesla why not?IT'S A CAR MAKER. They have the expenses of a car maker, they sell cars and make all their money from cars. They are not a technology company. Toyota has a PE of 10 and sells 10m cars a year.&#x200B;>Tesla is grossly undervalued, and the market is providing a huge opportunity for those able to keep a level head.Even at the opportunistic scenario Tesla is overvalued. If we assume 1.7m sold cars and 55k average selling price at 15% operating margin. the valuation becomes a disaster. (deliveries have been flat the last three quarters now)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 15:27:44'] Good analysis. But you need to take these factors into account.Current and historical operating margin for Tesla (TSLA) over the last 10 years. The current operating profit margin for Tesla as of September 30, 2022 is 14.95%. Expect China be more profitable.Explore the qty of Tesla or % not sold sitting paying higher interest (inventory and interest carrying charge) etc. Should an inflation slow down sales.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 20:16:58'] A lot of TSLA bulls have been saying the exact same thing and no one listens. Remember this is only automotive. What about FSD, super charging, energy, Semi and Cybertruck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 00:56:42'] Your assumptions are really bad. Such a big margin with price cuts? Using operating profit for P/E calculation? By writing such nonsense you are only fueling the thesis of overvalued Tesla.Which I don't think is reasonable either. But not while valuing Tesla like that. Rather, I do think the FSD is getting nearer - yes, I know Elon was saying for years "next year" or even "this year" but let's just ignore that for a moment and focus on the state of FSD beta right now and on the fact that they are going to have very soon a lot more computation resources for neural networks training (DOJO clusters coming up). They were obviously limited in computational power to be able to utilize their vast dataset collected from their growing fleet and now they are going to grow the power by several times. 2023 looks really good in my view when it comes to visible FSD improvements. They should be able to get it to a point where people start to believe it is coming soon. And this should drive the TSLA price way up. I don't know when that will happen but it does look like they are planning an unveiling event for Q1, probably the new robitaxi, without the steering wheel.Obviously now almost no investors price in any of the FSD, which can be seen for example in this thread. I think it's a mistake, FSD should be partially priced in today while valuing Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-21 02:27:06'] If you have no demand then your supply means nothing. The stock was over-priced, its crashing now, just passed 225 period weekly moving average, and it will likely never even approach half it's ATH again. I can't understand seeing these post. Have people posting this never heard of a bubble, a prisoners delima, questionable accounting practices, market crashes, supply AND demand....I don't understand. Are they bot posts, posts from the extremely emotionally attached, people in denial, paid propaganda..?. Like what?The crash is happening RIGHT NOW. Comparing likely dubious forward P/E which has not accounted for new market realities, and comparing it to apple if all thingWILL NOT make the crash go away.Will it bubble again? Highly unlikely but possible. HOWEVER nigh impossible for it re-bubble mid-crash. Like the odds of finding an ice cream shitting unicorn. Sure maybe, just maybe...

The world is heading into a recession. The US citizens (and likely the case is the same everywhere else) have an increasing amount of debt (record high actually), savings rate at nearly an all time low (since 1959, only 2005 had lower savings rate than now).What in this makes you think expensive and non necessary shit like Apple's products and Tesla cars will continue to sell at the same rate they sell now, or even faster? Apple will not grow next year, I have high doubts Tesla will grow 50% next year, you should be happy if it grows at all. With what money exactly do you think people will pay?

Loans are only going to become more expensive as quantitative tightening continues.Look at how much AAPL makes in net income compared to TSLA and then factor in AAPLs dividend as well. We have entered a stagflationary cycle imo which means a dollar today is worth significantly more than a dollar 1 or 2 years from now. That is why we‚Äôve seen a significant rotation out of tech/growth and into energy, financials, industrials, healthcare, and consumer staples. It‚Äôs time to prioritize capital preservation and cash flows. Ie dividends and businesses that are recession proof
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 22:53:11'] I think the fundamentals of Tesla are quite strong but my main issue is with Elon and the brand image.

Yes: agility scares people because it relies on rapid iteration of ideas - which means that the first iterations will not be optimal (or possibly not even good)But anyone working in the software realm (or in research) knows that this is how you get results in the end. You don't go to a good process/product by years of planning and *then* implementing...because that's a recipe for finding out that most of your plan doesn't mesh with reality and that you've now wasted years of everyone's time.Chill. Wait for a year and then see how it turns out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 00:02:30'] i think he‚Äôs just overly invested in the idea/koolaid of twitter as a public forum /thought journal and voicing ideas trying to spark a brainstorm. which yes is ridiculous and incredibly naive. or yes the purchase drama was the last straw.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 07:04:07'] I hope it falls to 50 so I can buy some. Long term this is just noise. Short term it could be an opportunity soon
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 09:19:59'] The next big short idea. Get all advertisers to pull out of Twitter. Force Elon to fund Twitter debt payments by selling tesla stock. Sinking the stock back to precovid levels.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 11:29:24'] While there are some natural concerns with any public figure being controversial while owning one of the most talked-about public companies in the world, there is a lot of pessimistic sentiments being made here that are just impossible to predict until there is a clearer picture.1. Tesla investors can be pissed but the operations of the business is all that matters and right now, it's operating beautifully with/without Musk. Long-term, this is all noise. Literally, no one who is investing in Tesla long-term sees an issue with Twitter because the operations of Tesla will soon be impossible to ignore. Firstly, they are already going to be the most profitable U.S. automaker this year. By the end of next year, they will be the most profitable automaker in the world with a projected $18 billion in net income. Is Twitter really going to come into play here?2. Elon didn't cut 'half' of Twitter's engineering staff. Namely, a large % of them were already planned to be laid off before Elon took over. Hence, why Meta is also planning on laying off thousands of workers. It's an industry layoff. In Twitter's case, these workers were not needed because the projects that they had been working on were scrapped, thus, they aren't going to be working on Twitter's future plans. Most people in the tech community will tell you that they haven't been working much while at home. There's a reason... they really aren't adding much value to the overall company. The reason these tech companies hired en masse was to prevent them from going to their competitors in what they expected was going to be an economy largely dominated by people WFH and thus, using their platform more. When that didn't happen, they all started laying off these workers. 3. Going to your Twitter cash burn, it's true that they lose over $1.3 billion every year. And removing those Twitter employees will cut that amount to $900 million. His initiatives that he plans on pushing out is largely designed to create an alternative source of revenue which in all likelihood, is TBD. He literally took over two weeks ago. I don't see how you can accurately presume that it won't work.4. Those people making names to imposter people is going to get fixed real quick. Either way, they are paying $8 just to get banned shortly after. They are trying new methods and there are ways to correct them.Was Twitter a mistake for Mr. Musk? Yes, probably so. But the verdict on whether he can turn Twitter around is going to require more than two weeks to decide. IMO, there are lots of ideas that are going to be implemented that will positively turn Twitter around. Either way, Tesla on its own is more than capable of operating with or without Musk. I highly doubt Musk's presence is even needed with Tesla right now. There are people who are put in charge who are familiar with how Tesla operates by now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 12:11:54'] "half baked ideas, empty promises, erratic." Like that never surfaced at Tesla

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 14:06:44'] It‚Äôs not a case of just flipping a switch and off to the races. It‚Äôs a transition and like any acquisition it will take time and experimentation. Nothing to get worked up about.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 15:31:08'] I think Musk is a clown, but A/B tests are usually better for evaluating small changes. For the massive overhauls he's making I'm not sure A/B testing would help too much. That being said, I do think he's speed running bankrupting a massive social media company. That being said, I don't full know or understand the effect Twitter's failure would have on Tesla stock. At the very least, there's the reputational impact on Elon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 15:44:31'] The biggest risk is that he s seriously taking twitter seriously. He seems to want to make it an uber-app but  tshitter is very ill-suited for that. And all that wasted energy will show in the performance of spacex and tsla

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 10:33:50'] I feel like people who believe this haven‚Äôt been following Elon. He‚Äôs always been a bit nuts. Pedo guy anyone?  This is just how he behaves. He gets shit done though, clearly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 08:45:06'] Elon is going to create a decentralized monetary system.  Starlink, Mars, and twitter combined will be able to remove govt strength over individuals money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 12:12:24'] I think we are underestimating Elons capacity. On top of that, we all know how forward thinking he is. I have high hopes this will come full circle to benefit both parties.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 18:01:00'] What‚Äôs truly nuts is that Elon paid me $54.20 a share for something that could be very well be worth zero a few months from now. How often do us proles get one over on the billionaires?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 12:13:52'] > Do you think TSLA might break below this year‚Äôs low at $620?Yes, but because it is a bear market, and many stocks are likely to make new lows in the coming months.On the 1 year chart:- TSLA is flat (up 0.6%)- AMZN is down 36%- MSFT is down 4%- AAPL is up 2%- GOOG is down 11%Q2 will be a delivery miss (because of China lockdowns, supply chain issues) but it is unclear how much of that is already priced in.  It will probably be TSLA's worst quarter in 2020-2030.  That may bring it down a little, but most of the price action will be determined by the broader market, which is 1-24 months away from bottoming/recovering.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 10:29:33'] If you just assume 50% growth for twenty years and assume they can keep the same margins for a couple decades and assume traditional manufacturers can't produce EVs very well, it's probably worth more like $12 Trillion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 10:34:01'] Yes I can see it going lower, and yes I can also see it then regaining ATH. It‚Äôs a volatile stock off a huge recent run up with a notorious and controversial ceo and majority stockholder. This is also a very hard time for EVs and businesses in general. So I can absolutely see more pain in store for TSLA. But I also think they have proved themselves as a solid business with a strong future, so I believe they will recover their ATH and continue growing at some point. But it‚Äôs not a holding for the faint of heart

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 19:34:00'] I think it‚Äôs going to reattempt and break 755 if we get a another ‚Äúsmall rally‚Äù‚Ä¶ earnings is going bring it down. Logically this stock should be around 850 despite market lag. Pure reasoning is no other EV has came close yet in which case TSLA will continue to dominate 2023. VW has been sneaking up, but their market and target are specific to certain crowd. Strong numbers are going to be reported out Austin. Germany and china plants will be laggers. But that‚Äôs overall supply chain.To answer your original question. It may very well go down to 620 tomorrow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 10:23:59'] Yes. I think people are realizing stocks with extreme valuations aren't worth the gamble anymore in this bear market. We are no longer in a super low interest rate environment which previously benefited these kinds of highly speculative growth stocks. That's before we even consider the specific risks to Tesla (huge amount of the value is based on the controversial celebrity CEO).Look what happened to Netflix. It was a high growth, high valuation stock a few years ago. Other companies caught up, Netflix failed to innovate and attract positive attention. Now it's down 80%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 13:03:58'] My entry point for TSLA is 420.69

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 07:13:17'] I'm genuinely surprised by how well TSLA has held up to be honest. I'd have assume a lot of the people holding TSLA would be meme stock / crypto traders and would be selling TSLA to cover margin calls and rebalance elsewhere.I think TSLA will go lower and I wouldn't be surprised if it got to low $500s before this is all over, but it's so hard to predict anything with TSLA. Elon does a great job up pumping the stock so I also wouldn't bet against $620 being the low.At the end of the day no one here knows, the only thing that matters is that there's a good possibility it will go below $620 and you need to be prepared for that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 12:14:34'] Yes, definitely. One bad earnings report in this environment could cut it in half. There's no fundamental support for its current valuation so all it takes is for sentiment to turn and it'll crater. See Netflix. Down another 80-90% over the next couple years isn't out of the realm of possibility.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 11:26:07'] No one here knows shit, and are spouting opinion riddled with perosnal bias against or for TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 11:44:21'] It doesn‚Äôt matter. Tesla is a long term play. I have no heard one single bear argument that has convinced me that Tesla will not be the best performing stock of the 20‚Äôs. EDIT - The stock everybody wished they bought in 2020 when we get to 2030. No growth - Two new factories just opened and production continues to ramp up every year. Margins get better every year. Competitors are coming - VW are the only car company that seems to be taking the EV race seriously. The rest or not making them at a profit or at mass production. No demand - Sells every car they can produce. Do not currently advertise. Too expensive - Already selling as many as the higher cost models they can produce. Will likely introduce more affordable models and reduce current prices once production increases. Rocket man bad - The current administration cares more about swing state votes that climate change which is insulting. Will not capture the market - The EV pie is growing, especially with these gas prices. Even if Tesla ramps up and competitors make the very expensive transition from ICE to EVs there will still be greater demand than they can meet for years to come. Overvalued - If a risk or plausible bear case comes up that suggests Tesla cannot continue to ramp then the stock price will respond accordingly. The fact that it‚Äôs holding above $600 in this market is very bullish. A company like Toyota isn‚Äôt valued as Tesla is because they wont be selling 10m ICE cars in the future. So bring on the downvotes. If you are a bear and disagree then respond with a calmly written explanation with why you think that is the case and we can go in to it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 10:59:49'] Yes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 11:40:29'] I have long been warning the Musk fans that TSLA is the most overvalued major stock, a giant meme stock.  yes it has growth (though not this quarter) but 90-150 PE is ridiculous, that is mostly a Musk celebrity fanboy premium, a cult of personality.  TSLA is a fine stock at $300-$450 depending on how well things go this coming year.  Even at $620 it is grossly overvalued.   Also, Musk seems to have incited a mutiny amongst many of his employees and a possible boycott amongst his liberal democrat customers.  He is also losing a lot on cryptos and is the target of two shareholder lawsuits for stock and Dogecoin manipulation.  Plus the Twitter deal is not going to happen unless he coughs up the full price which will likely weigh on TSLA shares because he will need to sell more of them or use them as high-risk collateral.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 12:55:40'] With Tesla you never know. Could hit 10 dollar or 5000 dollar. All I know is to NEVER bet against tesla or anything Elon does because his supporters will bankrupt you
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 11:26:33'] PE is still insane
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 12:58:49'] It's certainly possible. Q2 has been a disaster for Tesla. The recovery is looking incredible, but won't be visible in Q2 results yet. It's definitely possible that Tesla will go down significantly after Q2 and Q3 will most likely be their biggest beat in the company's history.Either way, Tesla is extremely cheaply valued now. At worst they'll be doing $32B in net income in 2024, at best about $67B. With their current market cap, that would give them a PE between 9 and 20, despite growing earnings around 50% per year. That's a PEG between 0.2 and 0.4. I don't believe a large cap has ever traded that low, normal is around 1, AAPL and MSFT are trading between 1.8 and 2.5.At that time they'll also be doing more in net income than all other automakers combined, and more than Amazon or FB. They'll even be nearing MSFT and Google.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 15:06:07'] Just wondering how it works for people asking such questions. Do you count all the "Yes" "No" and make percentage out of it to decide whether to buy or not?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 20:51:38'] This stock is so overvalued.  What exactly does Tesla do that cannot be copied to some degree, that will command this price long-term in the market?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 02:18:34'] Was curious if you were going to set a timeframe. I think it could get near to $620 today! Never mind hitting $620 in the next 1000 years.Complete ballpark figures, but each dollar of price is roughly 1 billion mkt cap, how the fuck is it worth around $680billion???  Compare it Ford, GM, Volkswagon etc, surely something around $300Bil is somewhat realistic. I'll even give you $400Bil so around $400 per share.It has a long way to fall IMO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 19:28:23'] Fundamentally don‚Äôt care.  I have 800 or so shares that I sell 1 covered call a month on for 1500 income.  I sell a put or two when it has a crash for another bit of income.  Current put is for 550 and expires on 7/15.  I‚Äôd be happy to take 100 at 550 so I could sell a call for 750 and keep making money off of it.I‚Äôve held since 2017 and planning to hold until 2025 at least.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 00:35:45'] Tesla is a growth stock, and the market has been punishing growth stocks in favor of value stocks for the past couple of months.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 10:40:16'] First, I don't see why TSLA would ever go up again. It's priced for a level productivity it may never achieve in decades.This is a minor action in a company of 100,000 employees. They're doing something that can easily be remoted in one of the most expensive places on Earth. And it's probably something they need less of as their recognition database matures. Even in a stronger economy this should be a rote business move that reflects nothing about the company's fundamentals.I.e., it's not as big a deal as everyone is making it, certainly not when there are much bigger reasons to think the company is massively overvalued.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 13:16:27'] TESLA is arguably the most productive and innovative company in America. Anything under $500 would be a steal (about 30x next year's earnings). The largest issue is making enough cars fast enough, supply chain issues, semiconductor shortages, and increasing materials is the biggest obstacle. Tesla sells cars as fast as they can produce them, we have no idea what a future stable demand: supply ratio will be, as Tesla is producing cars well below demand cand cannot make new factories fast enough.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 18:26:39'] What a weird comparison.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 17:06:31'] In what world are either of these companies comparable??Correct me if I'm wrong but tesla was trading at something like 25x sales at its peak. To think the stock collapse was not justified reminds me about one of my favorite quotes about valuation >What were you thinking?!Scott McNealy was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of the dot com bubble. At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time:>At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don‚Äôt need any transparency. You don‚Äôt need any footnotes. What were you thinking?Even at 5x sales its relatively expensive. These two companies are not comparable
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 19:19:17'] Lulu is certainly not undervalued given the current macro environment but i wouldn‚Äôt short it..they have insane growth..just look at that rise in gross profits overtime(https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/LULU/lululemon-athletica-inc/gross-profit) ‚Ä¶also very loyal customer base(upper middle class white women mostly)..look up becky stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 21:03:41'] I love $LULU products so much, try their overpriced sweatpants and ABC pants. I think you‚Äôll buy some stock lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 16:53:34'] I'd argue NKE is even more over valued and slower growth.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 16:50:03'] Tesla has been grossly overpriced for years, IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 20:26:42'] Stocks like Lululemon and Nike always seem overvalued. However, I warn investors never to underestimate the value of a strong brand name. A strong brand name itself can be a moat.Starbucks sells coffee at a premium value and has done so successfully because of the Starbucks brand name. This applies to many markets. A car gets you to point a to point b yet people will pay x3 for a BMW or Benz when they could have a reliable Toyota or Honda at a more reasonable price.These companies sell an aspiration/lifestyle and have a dedicated customer base. Please don't assume all customers want to buy the cheapest apparel or discount brand. Louis Vuitton has built a financially profitable luxury brand. Apple essentially sells luxury phones.You can call these consumers financially irresponsible or dumb but ask yourself, will consumer behavior change anytime soon?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 20:12:47'] Depends on if Lulu is luxury or not. Some of their customers are definitely poor/middle class, but their consistent buyers are probably trendsetting/following women who can possibly spur people without the income to feel pressured to have the look. They‚Äôre also expanding male market share. Very comfortable sweats and they look amazing. That Arnault guy being the worlds richest person is an ominous bellwether for me. Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy is the largest luxury brand, we‚Äôre entering a Gucci/Dollar Store economy where there‚Äôs no middle class, just poor and rich. I think companies will have to choose, are we all value or all quality/gravitas.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 18:00:19'] LULU has ridiculous growth and tremendous balance sheet. I don't think LULU is a good short play
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 18:11:51'] Yes. If they sell short pants.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 17:49:35'] $TSLA is the greatest short
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 19:00:59'] Both are terrible ideas right now
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 20:44:45'] The reason the question is silly is that with all the stocks in the world, you can find terrible stocks that have tremendous years and terrific stocks that have terrible years. The question assumes that the past performance should have something to do with the future performance as though a mean reversion is gravitational or something. I don‚Äôt know much about LULU but I‚Äôm fairly certain TSLA will go low 90s or lower before finding a bottom. If I was a betting man I‚Äôd say around 85. Too many people waiting for 70 so I doubt we get there without even more dire developments.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 22:21:49'] Still a good case to be made that tesla is overvalued
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 04:06:33'] People are obsessed with lulu.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 07:54:57'] Innovative maybe; efficient doubtful. Innovation creates inefficiency.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 09:52:33'] I would be buying lulu well before Tsla. Look at what Tsla piers trade for and what lulu trade for. It‚Äôs about the same as Nike and growing faster. Granted you could argue that is expensive to.No positions in either.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 13:57:11'] LULU will definitely drop like a rock in the coming months.Many people in middle income categories spent way too much money on home office setup, travel, luxury spending and so on which reflects the loose monetary policy in action.Similarly tightening the monetary policy will have reverse effects.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 19:48:08'] Looks like it was choice #2, LULU was the greatest short
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 17:10:33'] Neither‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 09:50:41'] Tsla is equivalent to throwing your money in the garbage
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 04:48:46'] I would rather short the US dollar to zero than go long on TSLA. TSLA was a scam to discredit the EV industry.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 07:16:00'] I don't know anything about LULU, but I do believe TSLA is currently an insane buying opportunity. There has been a perfect storm of negative sentiment for a company that just keeps kicking ass, which has caused the market to grossly overreact on the downside. If you still believe the growth story this is the buying opportunity of a lifetime. Personally I don't think Elon's crazy antics on twitter have much bearing on Tesla, and the market is quite short sighted to conflate the two.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 21:36:27'] Definitely LULU. kind of a secret covid-stock where ath-leisure got popular with work from home and then people got used to it, but consumer peak should be pretty bad for them.  Not nearly as bad as Tesla just because of the size of the company, but yes they should be trading way lower for a luxury retailer if there's any kind of slowdown.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:45:24'] Your point 2 is where all the issue with Tesla is. Human mind will love a product or service based on a holistic image e.g.,  Electric vision. At the same time, the human mind will dissociate with a product or service that is a butt of all jokes. I used to recommend Tesla but don‚Äôt anymore to my colleagues. The product has not changed. My attitude has. Tesla is no longer a great car. Too many flaws: build quality, FSD, making them unsafe by removing sensors, Musk only cares for short-term profits, etc. It‚Äôs in my mind that I vocalize to others. Humans are not entirely data driven. Point 8 (vertical integration) is a strength. You missed: Tesla is the most American made car. Does it deserve a market cap that‚Äôs 1/4th of all auto industry market cap. Not in the wildest dreams. Never ever.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:09:42'] Makes we wanna dump it even more. Thank you!
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 14:37:03'] >I sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again.They do. Elon Musk is Tesla. People associate him with them. If he insults the left, which is the primary market of EVs and spouts right wing opinions, those will leave. There is a reason why nearly all CEOs try to be in the shadows and only present a curated version of themselves (Jobs)&#x200B;>Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn‚Äôt a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)Here is where you are wrong. Consumer report has them among the lowest ranking cars in terms of reliability. It is similar to Jeeps and Aston Martin. A specific group loves the car with the flaws - but once they go mainstream they don't. Tesla has now just gone mainstream and you have loads of complaints now. A car is a transportation vehicle. Technology might be cool for the group that used to buy Tesla's (and that now Musk is alienating), but not for the majority of people. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 that has faster charging, cheaper, very close in range (nobody could reproduce Tesla's EPA rating, but from other brands they could) and is more comfortable with better interiors. &#x200B;>Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!First they do spend on advertising, they literally shot a Tesla into space. In fact they have the most expensive ad department in the world with Elon Musk. Musk cashed out 12b this year alone in stocks. No other company has the insane compensation package for the CEO. Tesla spends the most on advertising of any car company. They just call it compensation package for the CEO. &#x200B;>They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something ‚Äúfrivolous‚Äù like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly.They pay their suppliers 60 days later than most other car companies (Tesla around 82 days DPO - most other are max 30 days). Yes they are profitable now, but they are ramping factories quickly. If demand falls (and we are seeing that - why else would they have discounts in EU, US, China, Canada and Mexico) - then that profitability can quickly turn. Furthermore, FSD is smokes and mirrors and did not deliver what they promised. It could very quickly become a liability, if they have to refund them - and could seriously harm their cash cycle >Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions.Tesla's cars are priced, because they were the first ones and people tolerated cheap materials for an EV that has high range. Now there are alternatives. There is inventory in the US and Europe now already. Yes they are probably cutting production and are already cutting staff, but they are still valued like the biggest car companies combined. If you stop the growth, they will go back to a more car company like valuation (especially as margins will compress with the discount and less sales). Most car companies trade at 5-8 PE. &#x200B;>Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes ‚Äúfat‚Äù (ask any body builder). The ‚Äúrecession‚Äù is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!Tesla still has not ramped production in two factories. That are huge costs without any proper gain yet. I don't think GE is the example you want to give, given that they had fraudulent numbers. &#x200B;>Tesla is more than a car company‚Äù. This is a polarizing statement! But let‚Äôs look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do.They don't produce the solar panels - Samsung and Panasonic does. Insurance is a low margin business and I don't see any SaaS (FSD is not a product yet). The company loses money on everything except cars. So they are a car company. &#x200B;>They are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple‚Äôs consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!What? Apple is hugely dependent on Foxconn. That Tesla controls most aspects of production is a positive and a negative. It comes with great margins in good times, but it also comes with worse ones when there is a recession. If a car part maker of VW goes down, they find a new one - but in recessions Tesla will weather all the cost. The dealerships are the same thing. you get the money, but in bad times the price cuts of other car makers influence the dealer margins - not their own, and dealers can make it up in service. If you think that Tesla's decision are consumer centric, I advise you to read all the complaints about the service. People don't even get loaners. &#x200B;>Important point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution. Every challenge has been met with bold strategy and then executed to critical success. The team is the same, so why should the results be any different 10 years from now? Elon is one man and sure he may have brain fart from now and then, but the team and culture (results oriented) he has developed for the last 10 years will be the difference maker!They literally nearly went bankrupt in 2018 (by Elon's own worlds)and the only reason they did not is because of hype man Elon and a capital raise. Furthermore they sold a huge amount of carbon credits. I give them credit, they managed to make EVs cool, but you can not give them an A for excectuion here.  Regarding culture, I advise you to look at all the racism lawsuits. &#x200B;>Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest. I‚Äôm confident that even in the absence of Elon, there will be a competent leader who take the reins and extract greatness.We'll see. >I‚Äôm not going to call Elon a genius yet. But he is operating at much higher scale when compared to everyone else. Setting aside his success with PayPal. To gestate Tesla and at the same time expand into solar & rockets and compete successfully should show you that the man is not normal. And with this, you should expect some level of eccentricity. If not for this eccentricity (his downfall) he would likely rule the world. Be glad that Twitter is the channel for his eccentricities vs Tesla.Elon's x com merged with Confinity  only because they were both losing money. They completely scraped everything Elon did and ousted him as CEO. He literally lucked his way into Paypal. Yes he used government subsidies to create his companies. I give him credit to make EVs cool, but nothing more. Good luck with your investment. Just for your information. Tesla is still worth more than VW+Toyota+Ford+GM.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:39:07'] My qualitative take is:1. They make shitty expensive cheap cars2. Their brand is erroding and people connotate it with bad taste and tackyness, bad quality and cult-like idiots3. Build quality is abysmal4. Their margins are gonna evaporate because they either have to increase quality og decrease price5. VW and BYD is eating their lunch and they will never get a critical market share. Actually, they‚Äôre losing it
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:36:10'] I disagree with your first point. I bought a Polestar instead of a Tesla because I don't want to riding around in a Q-Anon mobile.I wouldn't buy donald trump branded sneakers.I wouldnt buy Majorie Taylor Greene branded sunglasses. Same thing with my cars. Shits tacky
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:32:53'] Point 1 - Starting before Twitter, Elon launched an effort to piss off liberals and progressives while trying to appeal to the "Fox News is too liberal" crowd. How many of his new demographic are trading in their F150 for a Model Y? vs how many liberals and progressives now don't want to be seen driving something associated with Elon?Point 2 is simply wrong. I drove a P100D ($160k car) for 9 months while my car was getting a new battery, new AC compressor, and new tire sensors. A day after it rained I got in the car drove up my driveway, put my foot on the brake, and water dumped all over my feet (inside the car). I drove to work with wet socks. That was one of a long list of quirks and issues. I ended up asking myself "if this car was $50k would I buy it"... I concluded no,On the plus side they do make money on servicing. After quoting ~$600 to replace the 4 tire pressure sensors they billed me nearly $2000 for that line item.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 10:57:00'] Let‚Äôs take this another way and look at the competition. I feel like most bears here aren‚Äôt in tune with the current state of the EV market. I encourage bears to read some threads in r/electricvehicles. Lots of people want a different option than a Tesla but end up going with a Tesla anyway. Why? The lack of charging infrastructure and the dealership model are the two huge factors that has kept the competition behind Tesla.So far, the competition‚Äôs biggest plus is being able to offer a lower cost vehicle with stats that got somewhat close to Teslas. Particularly with the $7,500 credit for foreign manufacturers such as Kia/Hyundai while Tesla got none for the past few years However that will change in 2023. Another downside is they don‚Äôt produce enough volume which means large wait times and being priced above MSRP by dealers.In 2023, if you‚Äôre buying from a competitor, you‚Äôre:‚Ä¢	‚Å†not getting the $7,500 credit (unless GM/Ford)‚Ä¢	‚Å†not getting access to a reliable charging network‚Ä¢	‚Å†going to have to endure the dealership experience‚Ä¢	‚Å†paying above MSRP‚Ä¢	‚Å†having to wait a long time for deliveryOnce these things become evident to EV shoppers, it‚Äôs gonna be really tough to not buy a Tesla. Even if it‚Äôs not your top choice. Even if you don‚Äôt like Elon. Virtue signaling is easy when it‚Äôs free (online opinions) but it‚Äôs hard when you gotta pay for it.Edit: for US market only.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:20:37'] Tesla makes great cars? The cars are absolutely bullshit and i hear many people complaining about the quality of tesla. price is to high for this kind of quality tesla is only living because of elon. if elon goes, tesla will die. it only lives because of his fanboys. the stock is so overvalued. tesla is bigger then toyota and volkswagen? what a bullshit.

Had one service they loaned us an even nicer model S and didn‚Äôt charge a dime.  100$ Uber credit for small service checkups.  I haven‚Äôt gotten anything remotely close to that experience at any other dealership.  Can‚Äôt leave a check up on my Subaru without being asked to drop a grand. People on these subs ‚ÄúWell the new Kia chargers faster than the Tesla, they will lose market share, superchargers don‚Äôt make money blah blah‚Äù who wants to drive a Kia with no range and a top speed of 55 mph.  Bottom line Tesla makes a phenomenal product.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:58:19'] elon buying twitter will ruin the stock for a while and it may never reach previous heights. Tesla is partially a product of gamma squeezes and short covering to higher and higher highs. You can‚Äôt still have that if he gets margin called and the float gets that much looser AND Cathie Woods blows up. Can you imagine a margin call into what looks like no buyers?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 08:19:08'] 1. Whiney pathetic liberal sheep ARE shying away from Elon because he is leaning Republican and their sheepish feelings have been bruised.2. Tesla does make great cars, but so do Mercedes, BMW, and Porsche3. Tesla will need to start advertising now that they are no longer the only lectric car on the market. This will eat into their margins.4. Other car companies are also profitable especially companies like Stelantis which has really solid financial fundementals.5. The supply of electric cars is being increased by other entrants into the lectric car market and companies like Ford, BMW, and Mercedes also have their respective fan boys6. At some point companies must transition from high growth to long term value. Exponential growth is not sustainable.7. The narrower the focus, the stronger the brand. Tesla may be better served by spinning off some of the other business units from the car company.8. Vertical integration has its pros and cons. Steve Jobs said if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go as a team.9. The rise has certainly been meteoric.10. That remains to be seen. Elon is the single most critical point of failure. He will be hard to replace. Tesla as a company does not yet have the track record of a company like Ford that has survived the great depression, two world wars, foreign competition, the financial collapse, etc.11. He never struck me as a genius just very logical and practical. Fossil fuels are the rarest, dirtiest, most dangerous form of solar energy in the universe.Elon understood that it takes energy about 8 minutes to reach the earth from the sun and it can be captured and used almost immediately without the need to wait millennia for it to be converted into oil, coal, or natural gas. That's not genius that's just being practical.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 11:42:00'] Tesla is an EV company,with a majority of its product sold in China.Lockdowns in China have been problematic.The US market is softening,with factory rebates doubling on some models.Tesla is paying people to buy their cars.This is not the sign of a growing market share,it‚Äôs a sign of a shrinking one.  The problem with the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a car company‚Äù argument is that %85 of revenue and %95 of profits from selling cars.I don‚Äôt know about you,but that sounds like a car company to me. Then we have the cult of Elon angle.The purchase of twitter was probably the dumbest thing musk could have done.Sentiment,brand image these things are core concepts for a company to experience rapid growth.His antics on twitter expose both himself and Tesla to a change in sentiment,which is what we are seeing here.The cult of Elon is unraveling.This twitter deal is a true YOLO, if Elon continues as he is, he will weaken not only his image/sentiment but teslas as well.If he is able to come up with something innovative with twitter, and actually make it work,it could of course be huge for tesla.The first route any idiot can do,the second will require some genius.The spotlight is on him,and we will see if he truly is a genius or just another idiot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 19:06:19'] The car industry's one of the most difficult industries to get into and a lot of companies have failed. Tesla's trying to achieve that at the same time as developing a new type of electric vehicle and charging network. They also changed the dealership model and spent millions building the "machine that makes the machine." They have lofty goals and they're pushing the envelope. It's up to their innovation and if the public will accept and use their product.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 06:26:59'] Tesla is already more profitable than the likes of Ford, Toyota, and VW and growing at a much faster rate.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 06:28:17'] Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 40, forward P/E  at 23, PEG at .78 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).    It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).    It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.    Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).    All this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.

Other manufacturers are catching up, giving the largely democratic customer base much more choice. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of a brands political association in these polarised times, I personally know multiple people who want an EV but are avoiding Tesla at all cost due to these reasons and the quality issues. He stated in the past that it is Teslas goal to electrify the transportation sector, so why is he supporting a party that is hellbent on defending fossil fuels? Just so he can ‚Äûown the libs‚Äú?

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:34:00'] Alienating more than 60% of your potential customers in the US is not a winning strategy. It‚Äôs clear that he posted allegiance to the GQP right before the sexual harassment news broke. He knew that GQP would not give a shit and fully embrace him regardless of what he did. And he was right. Whether potential EV buyers will be fully turned off by his childish antics or not remains to be seen. Still, based on his past, social emotional control is not his strong suit so I think a lot more dark days are ahead of him.

Even before this, things like "taking Tesla private" and the very public failure of Tesla's truck should have been red flags, indicating that he's just a third rate Steve Jobs who'd rather bullshit on Twitter than see major projects through.Musk's cult of personality was an asset when his companies needed hype, but it's turn into a serious liability. At some point cutting him loose will be matter of responsibility to shareholders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 14:49:47'] I am a software engineer and lately I‚Äôve been doing data science things. My employer says I‚Äôm a data scientist but I don‚Äôt really agree. But I do do a little bit of that as part of my job. In my relatively short time (1 year) doing ML/AI/data science things for my job, it seems to me that while all theoretically possible, the tools to get to things like self-driving cars don‚Äôt exist in the same way that tools for making an iOS app exist. Also, you can Google how to make an iOS app all day long, but in my day to day work I find it‚Äôs common to just not find anything on the internet about what I‚Äôm trying to build or do with ML/AI. I think it‚Äôs only a matter of time before Teslas really do drive themselves without any sort of disclaimer or asterisk attached. Part of it is in software as much as we try, we can‚Äôt always find all the bugs before going to production and releasing code to the users‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs for web apps. To thoroughly test Autopilot‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs realistic. I think there will be more Autopilot crashes/cases where it didn‚Äôt do what it was expected or supposed to do. Is what it is. Airplanes took a few decades of disaster before all the kinks were worked out. At this point, if a commercial plane crashes it‚Äôs almost certainly pilot error. Pilots (people) fly planes, and people write software like Autopilot. We aren‚Äôt perfect so Autopilot won‚Äôt be either, for a time anyway.Also, people like to wax about how TSLA is worth X because they have the largest network of charging stations in the US. That‚Äôs definitely worth something, but even more so is the IP that is Autopilot. Ford and others will spend TRILLIONS building their own self-driving hardware and software, and those will all have accidents too, unless Tesla decides to sell the Autopilot tech, but that doesn‚Äôt seem likely.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 12:07:14'] Elon always over promise but at least Space X is meeting its launch targets.He knows Tesla really only has less than 5 years left dominating the EV market.The big boys are catching up fast.Why did all of sudden turn on the democrats?.Was it the Me Too Movement catching up to him,taxation on billionaires or him screwing himself with the Twitter fiasco.Probably all three.Biden speech also named GM and Ford as USA EV future and not Tesla.Elon feelings got hurt.https://cleantechnica.com/2022/02/02/president-biden-hypes-ford-gm-evs-ignores-teslas-clear-leadership/

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 14:02:48'] Maybe a bad press week, but the reality is this company is light years ahead of the competition.  The charging network is the strategic advantage - just as iTunes was (and now the App Store) is Apples strategic advantage.  Prior to iPod there were dozens (maybe hundreds) of MP3 players, but grandma wasn‚Äôt about to go to a Russian website for free music and then figure out how to get it on the device.  iTunes made it easy to get tunes and apps in one place and it just works with iPod/iPhone/iPad.  If you haven‚Äôt got an EV today, you have no idea what the difference is finding charging for an non-Tesla EV vs a Tesla.  With Tesla, I show up and plug in.  With other networks, I need a special app to find a charger, another app to start /pay for the charging, and (assuming the station actually works) I likely have to have an adapter.  It‚Äôs a major pain in the ass that Ford/GM/Toyota/etc won‚Äôt invest in until it‚Äôs much too late/expense to catch up anytime soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-22 13:54:35'] I mean if dems stop buying Teslas, won‚Äôt that lead to surpluses and drop their value. I mean I don‚Äôt think anyone will buy them anyway.

Many mutual funds with large AUM deliberately use strategies to benchmark against the s&p ESG index by holding its constituents over or under- weight, so regardless they buy stocks in that index, because it‚Äôs in that index‚Ä¶ just a feature of how the market is structured. Right now beyond that, stock is down along with other large-cap growth stocks (similarly to NVDA)I would still recommending holding TSLA because fundamentally the latest earnings have crushed ests and (ignoring any obvious optimism on timelines‚Ä¶) the FSD and enabling software are enormous potential value. You have to believe in the long-term value that Elon is passionate about for Tesla and look past the short-term noise, so long investment time horizon is important.

Simple response to this one: In the coming years/decades were is global power/cars/labor/innovation going?TSLA makes everything the world is begging for.  They make ot with better margins than their competitors.  Their balance sheet is unassailable.  They attract the best talent in the world.  The share price reflects 2 things:-Twitter fears (will be over within a few weeks)- Irrational market fears (usually a good time to buy good companies)Most of the folks on this (and other subreddits) don't actually understand how growth companies should be valued so they will always mistakenly think high PE is over valued.  I'm a buyer of TSLA here, it could go lower in the coming weeks, but I know the company is a juggernaut so new highs are assured in the future.

I don't do Puts or Calls. Just a simple investor.This has nothing to do with investing. Sounds like you're either a trader, or more likely a gambler.As for what Tesla should be worth, price targets are difficult right now, both because of changing market conditions and the fact that Tesla is still growing extremely fast, making fair PE and PEG ratios difficult to determine. But I'm expecting Tesla to do ~$4.7B in Q3 and $5-6B in Q3, which would put the full year's earnings at $14.2B-15.2B orLet's say a fair PE on that would be between the current 72 and 50, and a fair PEG would be between 0.5 and 1. That would put the valuation between $710B and $1,094B, or between $1,121B and $2,640 respectively.So a price target for FY 2022  would probably be somewhere in the $900B-$1,200B range after Q4 earnings are announced (February). That would be a share price of $286-349.

While it remains unclear how the global EV giant accomplished the feat, the Model 3 now has a starting price of around $32,000. TSLA stock jumped Wednesday.\n\n**Tesla stock advanced 1.6% to 224.83 Wednesday during market trade with Tesla Model 3 vehicles going for as low as $30,330 on the company's website.** \n\nTesla is officially saying the Model 3 starts at $32,740 after the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Meanwhile, reports circulated early Wednesday that Tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in India.

Two quick examples of mine:\n\n1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.\n\n2.

Buying a Tesla has been a game changer for me. I charge at home, so I never have added stops and don‚Äôt spend $800/month on gas anymore. I use the basic autopilot for nearly 2 hours every day. Passing acceleration and driving up hills (I live in the PNW) are cherries on top. I love the car. I also believe the company may be equal to biotech in terms of being absurdly difficult to properly value. There are a number of potential revenue streams (monetizing the app by opening the charging network to other makers, monetizing proprietary charging hardware/hook up, potential ad revenue via app, and a ton of other things), but there‚Äôs also the very real chance that none of those things materialize or fail to be meaningful. There are also Elon‚Äôs Tweets, which have a massive impact on stock price movement. I love my car, but won‚Äôt have direct exposure to the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 09:17:19'] I've been exposed more and more to Apple products in recent years and I am slowly seeing the light. MacBook batteries don't drain, the phones are slick and IOS is slick and the OS equally is slick. It feels like a richer and smoother product compared to windows. There is also native terminal! Its all on face level however. Windows is better, PCs are better, android is better and google is better. But you need a lot of computing knowledge to get there. But overall I can see *why* people buy the products and stay with the products. Tesla has lost all hope from me as a stock holder. All other companies are making EV's , and there is push backs on tesla. Unless they make serious bounds in auto driving there isn't much for Tesla to go. Elon equally name is tainting tesla as a company. He got political and really, even myself, got swept up in his pr campaign when he was first coming around. There is future for tesla for sure. People keep buying them and driving them. But other companies are going to essentially stop teslas growth. Equally, conservatives hate ev's and liberals hate elon...who the hell do you have left?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:49:14'] >I never owned a single Apple productThis is so funny to me, you absolutely think they are overpriced but have never owned one.For phones, the pricing is similar for a similar product. For computers it has always been like that. I have owned Mac's and PC's for 20 years. Mac's always last longer with less issues.The problem is people see a low end PC price and think it compares to a Mac. Look at specs. Mac doesn't make a low end computer.This us vs them for Mac/PC, iPhone/Samsung, XBox/Playstation is so absolutely ridiculous but somehow people believe one is actually better than the other.

POST_TEXT: b"Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).\r  \n\r  \nThe founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.\r  \n\r\n\nNvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  \nIt hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading s"

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:54:00'] I mean..... it clearly is
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:28:44'] I‚Äôm not saying NVDA is not overpriced. It certainly appears to be. But so is the entire ARK portfolio. Also Tesla aims for $8-10 TRILLION in revenue by 2030‚Ä¶ so Tesla is going to 100x their revenue in 7 years. This woman must be high off her ass or something
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:38:25'] What exactly has Cathie Wood accomplished?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:36:23'] Everyone and their grandma was talking about how overpriced NVDA was, and after the rally everyone's shitting on Cathie in particular like they weren't parroting the same shit for months
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:51:18'] Cathie thought it was overpriced at a much lower price as well. She may very well be right this time. But she's not somebody you should listen to.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:11:52'] Couldn‚Äôt she just pull up a spreadsheet. Make up some bullshit numbers. Plug in 50% growth for 10 years and set a price target of 2000 after buying it and call it a day? That‚Äôs how she hit with Tesla, her single successful stock.Valuation only matters to sane people.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:34:02'] The time to sell is probably when she buys in
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:14:03'] NVDA may very well be overpriced. But we won't know for sure until we look back a few years from now.If you watch her CNBC interview, one of the reasons she gave was Tesla Dojo. LMAO. Her ‚Äúresearch‚Äù has little depth and is often misguided. I watch entertainers like Cathie Wood for fun. To understand AI market I follow real experts like Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI), who said and I quote ‚Äúit turned out that they make a lot more GPUs than TPUs [or specialized chips] so it's cheaper to train on GPUs.‚Äù Google has thousands of engineers working on software and hardware around their TPU. If anyone is going to take market share from Nvidia, it will be Google, not Tesla. Cathie is full of shit and talking her own book.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:02:29'] She calls out NVDA for being overpriced, which it probably is, but doesn‚Äôt call TSLA overpriced, which it clearly is. This just comes off as sour grapes and trying not to look like a clown for selling too early.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:36:52'] I thought valuations didn't matter for companies changing the world and innovation. Weird!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:36'] She isn't wrong about it being over priced, doesn't mean demand won't keep it overpriced.  Didn't she sell her shares 3 months ago?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 06:13:39'] She not wrong, but that doesnt mean it wont still go higher to insane levels. Just like her favorite tesla. So in that sense, she kinda is wrongüòÖ

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 03:54:07'] >Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after looking at the stock price.FTFY
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:33:41'] Counter take: This is the one time she did good by her investors by reducing risk before an earnings. Sure it turned out to be wrong, but removing risk is never something that should be scoffed at or followed up with FOMO. Stocks at highs tend to be at most risk for correction if earnings do anything less than exceed. This is contrary to every other call she has made of keeping a high risk-on portfolio during high interest rate enviroment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:17:58'] Besides her missed bet she may be right with that one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 05:23:10'] First time she makes sense and being responsible with her clients money. Its okay to miss a rally. There will be 1000s of opportunities if AI is really the next revolution

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 04:30:19'] She is not wrong here with the word overpriced but that did not stop Tesla when that stock was overpriced. It still went up until it crashed like bitcoin etc. The power is in the memo or fomo investors. When they all get bored. It's short short short.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 18:24:42'] She made a lot on NVDA and she's still making as some of her funds still hold it. You sell on the way up, not on the way down.

POST_TEXT: b'Its really funny to me the way these stocks move. I keep seeing this pattern, where a big company\'s share price is going down, stays down for a while, and then after a month or two, for no reason people decide today is the day we need to make this stock rip when nothing really changed from a month or two ago. And off it goes. \n\nIts like we collectively come together and decide "you know today is the day google should start ripping" \n\nIt happened with Tsla, meta, nvdia, google...\n\nWatch for intel or lyft or something to do this in the next 3 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 20:47:06'] Comments like this show a clear misunderstanding of what the market is and what stocks are and how they function. During Nov 2021 google was a $150 stock. It then lost about 40% of its valuation over a period of about 1.5 years because of a combination of many macro economic factors with inflation being the biggest one. There were serious fears of runaway inflation during that time. Russia invaded Ukraine causing oil price shocks. Did you forget about all these MACRO events that occurred during that time? But what actually changed for Google? Not much. Was the 40% drop warranted? It depended on what happened. If inflation would have gotten worse and the economy tipped into a serious recession then yes. But it didn‚Äôt. The job market held strong. Inflation is now cooling off so we are seeing a resurgence of buying in large cap stocks. See the problem is that you forget your history already. And it‚Äôs only been 2 years and you have forgotten the events that triggered the sell off 1.5 years ago. So you have this mindset of ‚Äúfor no reason.‚Äù You think it‚Äôs funny how these stocks ‚Äúmove.‚Äù The things that drive the stock market the most is large macro scale economic events and the healthy of the economy. It‚Äôs not magic and it‚Äôs not random BS.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 16:57:02'] We collectively decided it when its P/E was much lower than the 'high growth' companies like KO and PG. It was panic sold and now is returning to a more reasonable price.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 17:10:50'] if yoy inflation dropped to 3% google would rip to $200. all the top tech stocks are dependent on low inflation. you can't predict why/when they'll pump, but goog at $90 was a no brainer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 17:34:38'] Google needed to show its competency in AI before there was going to be a price takeoff similar to MSFT.Why they had to 'prove' their AI competency is beyond me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 16:34:34'] Investors and funds buy into the safest investment with the possibility of gains. Tech is safer in this projected recession since many have cash with little debt to deal with rates, large tech companies have a moat, and will likely not go to 0 if the market crashes.Pretty much just sector rebalancing to match current market sentiment
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 19:38:47'] Sometimes it‚Äôs foreseeable, earnings reports come out very 3 months or so, top holders may even have a good idea what it‚Äôs going to say before it‚Äôs actually published. Sometimes it‚Äôs just coincidence. These past few months have been harder on shareholders, but this month wasn‚Äôt, or dividends came out and most of the larger management firms decided tech google. Lastly unless your an insider you can‚Äôt really say wether or not manipulation is occurring so you also can‚Äôt leave that out. Market makers slowly sell off the larger stocks to cover the battle against smaller stocks, then when granted a reprieve from those smaller stocks buying back more of those larger stocks. I‚Äôve only been watching stocks for a few years now, but I‚Äôve seen enough to question everything. Unless a crash comes the old proverb remains that if you believe in a companies value, hold, if it‚Äôs a good company the stock will eventually go up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 21:53:21'] That‚Äôs not what happened with google at all.

Followed by them revealing their promising AI plans and boom sentiment shift.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 11:38:31'] I sold 100 shares of Google at $101 and 150 shares of Amazon at $104 like less than a month ago after them being basically stagnant or down for 5 + months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 12:32:12'] I think it took four months for investors/analysts to come to the realization that Google actually **ISN'T playing catch-up to Microsoft in AI**, that in fact, it's completely the opposite.Before you spit your coffee through your nostrils, think about these actual FACTS1. Google started up Google Brain (Their internal AI division) in 2011.2. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014. At this time, DeepMind was their No.1 competitor in AI.3. Google announced they are an "AI First" company in 2017, even though they'd been AI first since at least 2014 (year of the DeepMind acquisition)4. Google Brain publishes a whitepaper on "transformer networks". This is the underlying technology that's powering ChatGPT4. In fact, ask Sam Altman about it. He'll tell you that ChatGPT4, or ChatGPT anything, wouldn't actually exist if it wasn't for Google's in-house ML engineers that released that whitepaper.5. Microsoft has been an "AI First" company for maybe two years tops? I know their investment in OpenAI was July 2019, but that was more of a dipping their toes in the water moment than anything.6. Google employed thousands of ML/AI engineers across all their divisions as far back as 2014. Microsoft maybe had a hundred (if even that) ML/AI engineers in 2014?7. Sergey Brin and Larry Page have recently come out of "retirement" to help steward the merger of Google Brain and DeepMind into a singular unit within Google. The ultimate AI brain trust.8. LLM's (Large Language Models) aren't the alpha and omega of AI advancement. It's just one small aspect of the overall AI field.9. Bard might be FAR behind ChatGPT4 as a LLM, but we don't know with any certainty that Google doesn't have something far more advanced than Bard that they simply don't intend to reveal to the public anytime soon. Remember, Google Brain has been banging away since 2011 and DeepMind has been banging away as a member of Google since 2014.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 18:46:58'] Google is going to be around for next 10 years atleast so $90 was a decent entry point. You can still suck up and get it now because eventually it will cross 150 and 200 as well within a year or two or keep missing out.

What happened is the composite man was done selling so it went down and then he started buying but he does it in a way that makes it not go up. Infact he also is probably paying for articles to bash the company while he buys. Then when he‚Äôs accumulated as much as he can and can‚Äôt hold it down anymore with ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù he sends it up himself kickstarting people FOMOing into it as it ‚Äúbreaks out‚Äù then he sits back and lets it go up trimming their position very strategically as it goes up and then sideways.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 18:41:55'] OP, you're making excellent comments and being downvoted by idiots. I think this is partly the answer to your initial question (people are idiots and sheep, and so there's really no rhyme or reason for any of these valuations). The other part to consider is the huge extent to which stock prices are dictated by short-term technical trading (for instance, the low of practically every market in the world was hit when SPX hit its 200 week moving average in Oct 2022, and then algos and traders catapult higher off of that, just like they did in Dec 2018).

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 20:30:01'] I was buying at $90... Even without the ai hype it was undervalued at those prices and below the average p/e of sp500. (Not average tech p/e but average p/e of all sectors...)Even at current prices it's still relatively cheap compared to other big tech companies. Forward p/e is 20, what company is reasonably priced in tech?Apple? Their forward p/e is +26Microsoft? Forward p/e is +29. All big tech have higher valuations, Google was lagging behind so it was just a matter of time before it caught up.As for Intel, it's struggling for the past few years. Even if it rallies I would still avoid it. I would rather be in a company growing earnings even if overvalued due to hype than a company consistently losing market shares.You realize that Google's rally is on the tame side in their sector due to fear of losing market shares to Microsoft? (Openai threat) right? Its still cheaper than for example coca cola (KO) both in current and forward p/e.If/when chatgpt/Microsoft doesn't damage Google's core (ads through their dominance in search), the rally should accelerate.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 16:16:39'] Layers of corrections waiting to happen. After the gamestock thing I‚Äôve learned that there‚Äôs a lot more institutional money out there with leveraged positions than there is retail buying and selling power. When those big shorts and longs close it doesn‚Äôt matter what retail is doing, the price is gonna move.Big money also looks for what they think are short term trends in the opposite direction to buy or sell into. Only way in and out of those positions is to counter what the rest of the market is doing. So things always seem to go the wrong way when news hits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 16:41:46'] People are retreating to safer investments, big names with low debt / high cash, ETFs etc, to ride out the volatility / interest rates impact.Likely big-tech is overbought, as these big boys don‚Äôt have much runway at their size, besides cannibalizing each other. (Microsoft vs Google in search, if MS can finally make a useful product with open ai,  or Facebook vs. Twitter / Tiktok , if anything Apple has continued their vertical integration path successfully, as well as getting away with charging a lot more, opening margins up, and still managing that silly high 30% tax on anything operating in their eco system)This and the general trend of belt tightening on the SWEs getting silly salaries, can drive down costs too.  (Always bemused me why app based gig work companies never made any money‚Ä¶, despite making services worse and more expensive for everyone, probably paying SW developers 300k-500k each TC has something to do with it‚Ä¶)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 04:56:30'] I don't doubt in the near future google will launch a new thing, which will be groundbreaking.  Like 'whaaaaaaat' kind of product. Trouble is, they'll launch it poorly, so that most people don't notice, then they'll add a chat/messaging module to it, that no one asked for, then merge it into a seemingly unrelated product, update it a few times so its unusable, then forget about it. It'll just be another little bitmap icon on the google menu in chrome in a year. Its the google way.  It's so strange that a company that large, is so shit at marketing. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èCough *google earth* Cough. They also, instead of just fixing basic bugs in something, revamp the whole thing into an awful UX, usually with the bugs remaining. They just did it with google home app, for smart things. The new version must have been designed by someone who has never actually used it, or has any home automation.  Baffling. Not that it matters, because the automation only randomly works anyway.  'Wake me up at 7:30am, Monday to Friday, tell me the weather and turn on these lights. Turn off those lights at 8:15am''Meh, some days maybe, others I'll just show in the log but won't have actually done it. Fuck you, its only an alarm. It's also 3pm and those lights are still on, but they'll show as off in the app. The garage door is also wide open, lolz ' ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èGoogle needs to steal some apple product and marketing people. Make a product, stick with the fucking product longer than a Spanish lunch break,  market product properly. Moah Profit.

When that sellers loser interest and capitulation happens, buying pressure takes over and off it goes seemingly all at once. The same thing can happen going the other way when a run up stagnates and hangs out near the top a bit without going anywhere. Bulls get bored, move on, and the loss of their support is reflected in the share price dropping like a stone.

It's that money is rapidly becoming worthless.Remember, stocks are a common hedge against inflation. Companies who are stable and growing generally increase in dollar value when inflation is high, simply because the dollars are worth less.That's why inflation is just a covert tax on the poor, because people who can afford investments don't lose out because of it.

POST_TEXT: b'*Short term noise*\n\n$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. \n\nThe twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and its causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, its short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. \n\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe its stress maybe hes actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, Ill leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if thats actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my per'
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 18:51:06'] What you said about luxury goods performing well in recessions is pretty inaccurate particularly at scale. The 50k car purchase is exactly the kind of thing a upper middle class person would postpone if they‚Äôre concerned with the economy and potentially getting laid off. Additionally how many more rich people can buy a new Tesla every year that‚Äôs inherently diminishing year after year. I would also argue that the upper class is more likely to stockpile cash and buy appreciating assets during a recession than buy a depreciating one. Making financially smart decisions is probably somewhat correlational with being upper class.Furthermore with higher interest rates auto loans are more of a risk and with potential defaults lenders will have stricter standards with lending which would reduce the pool of buyers. In short there‚Äôs a lot of macro reasons why growth will not be 100% this year and Elon himself has alluded to that in recent earnings which is a big reason the stock has fallen.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 18:14:15'] I heavily disagree that Elon's antics are short term noise. I think the market is finally becoming aware of just how much his involvement in the company has on risk potential. While you have seen far more consumer and governmental adoption of Tesla's vehicles, there is also growing discomfort with the brand because it is so heavily tied to Elon. He's become unpopular and by extension people are viewing Tesla in a worse light.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 19:10:38'] I‚Äôm more interested in the chip shortage. EV used more chips than your typical ICE cars. From those tear down video for Tesla vs other EV. Looks like Tesla had more in house chip production than most so my prediction is that Tesla will slightly down Q4 2022 but production will either the same or better starting 2023 when other automakers hit the massive wall known as chip shortages.Currently other automakers doing the mismatching parts from various auto part makers while slightly change outside design to make it more trendy results in 6-7/10 cars they made looks the same components to components. It‚Äôs like they are playing mismatch parts from auto vendors and hope to get a hit.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-13 22:14:18'] Elon is pissing off his main base of users, college educated, liberal minded upper middle class people.  If Tesla becomes too associated with the red hat way of thinking thanks to Elon, then sales in the USA will drop precipitously. In his other major market the government has 40 years of practice at taking foreign investment and technology, learning from it, and then killing the foreign brands in order to support local competition.  I find it hard to believe that the same thing won‚Äôt happen to Tesla that is now happening to VW, GM and others in China.  Stellantis already said ‚Äúenough of this BS‚Äù and left.  BYD, Nio, Xpeng, etc all offer similar quality at better price points to Tesla.  $TSLA is a very risky bet now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 08:10:33'] Tesla doesn‚Äôt seem crazy overvalued like it was at the beginning of the year, but it will hardly maintain the kind of growth it had in the past 2 years (remember used car prices spiked, a clear sign the car market demand was completely out of balance with supply).I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see the stock much lower, but if you can stomach a big short term loss, it might not be the worst play.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 13:42:52'] I'm not big on Tesla. They are about to be competing with about 3 dozen other car companies in the next handful of years and I just don't think their current valuation makes sense unless they become model-T era Ford dominant. The Elon drama just punctuates that. Who in their right mind would neglect one of the largest companies in the world to remove features from Twitter for a day? That's actually what Elon is spending his day today doing instead of running Tesla. What the actual hell is going on in his brain?

He has scammed share holders from bonds He lies about starting Tesla.The list just goes on and people are not good enough at detecting fraud and decit.The Tesla stock in it self is absolute shit and yes you can by higher growth companies with lower PE that make the best products just use a screener.This TESLA is shit:https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=dI rather go big DQ BBW TSM AMD GOLDhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DQ&ty=c&ta=1&p=dhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BBW&ty=c&ta=1&p=dhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSM&ty=c&ta=1&p=dhttps://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOLD&ty=c&ta=1&p=dIt's just a matter of time before market realize electrical cars are shit still and we might need something else. Or rather batteries are shit and so is producing cheap predictable electricity.I'd rather short Tesla they are incompetent nations that think mining crypto and robot taxi will work with their shit car.Elon Musk feeds on good will of people that want to save the planet and he is a parasite that needs removal from the economy before more damage is dealt. The stock is worth 10 PE just like other car makers so let it burn it's fully priced 10X already.So honestly how do you value a good scam or scammer? well stupid people spend money stupidly so stupid people are overpayed and bought tesla and now they lose money and their jobs. So ponzi stocks like these will go trough rough boom bust cycles and it will go to the bottom even if you sell or not. It's pure shit and even if market goes up and tesla along with it's probably just breaking the fall. So Tesla is just like a good stock with some leverage that makes it untradable trash. It's also a stupidity indicator if a company invests in tesla and is not an index follower the company has incompetent investors that will get burnt soon.

They just can't seem to meet their own production targets. Any real car maker is going to crush Tesla in the EV area. I don't see long term growth when the current CEO is CEO of 3 companies and has like 1/3 of the attention other CEOs have if we assume he splits his attention evenly across 3 companies.I very much prefer they hire someone who actually knows how to run a car company as CEO.

Ford is trading at a PE of 7, great tech with ICE, but is suffering temporary slowdown due to chip shortages.  Regarding their debt, it is primarily in their incredibly lucrative finance division and the debt (and risk) is tied to corporate bonds in another part of the company.Did you see the fall of Meta?

POST_TEXT: b'Vehicle recalls, lockdowns in China, Elon Musk\'s acquisition and involvement in Twitter- a number of factors have contributed to the selling pressure Tesla has faced in recent weeks. But with the stock having fallen for 8 of the last 10 weeks and now trading at 2-year lows, is all the negative news is priced in? \n\nDespite briefly dipping below, TSLA did close above support coming from the August 2020 highs at 167.50. This level may have added significance from a technical standpoint, as the breakout in November 2020 is what took the stock into "new-high" territory. Buyers may therefore eye this level as a good area for accumulation which could help the stock form a base, or even begin a rebound if longer-term investors also look to add to their positions. \n\nOf course, all trading carries risk, and TSLA could continue to struggle as the fundamental backdrop for the company, as well as the broader market, remain relatively bearish.'
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 03:15:25'] It‚Äôs very important to remember that TA describes observation of past (whether years or seconds prior to observation) supply and demand. Again, it tells you where entities *have* demonstrated demand. New information can change demand (move support up or down). This is why technicians are always saying ‚Äúif X, Y could happen, and if not, look for Z to be possible.‚Äù A different way to say it is, ‚Äúa bunch of institutions bought when the stock hit around this point 3 times last month. Maybe they‚Äôll do it again. If they don‚Äôt, we know a bunch of institutions bought around this other price six months ago, so we could see them do it again.‚Äù The decisions to buy at those levels were related to expected returns.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 01:19:31'] I don't know when, but it's clear TSLA will bounce at some point. It has a lower forward PE than Nvidia, Netflix and Chipotle at this point, despite having 5-10x the earnings growth.My best guess would be Q4 earnings report, as analysts are expecting $1.26 in EPS, and it will likely be more in the $1.3-1.4 range. But even if it doesn't happen then, TSLA is on track to have a PEG ratio in the sub-0.3s by 2025, while 1.5-3 is the norm for large caps. It will at least 3x in the next three years, possibly more.And that's only based on automotive. Not taking into account their spike in energy growth starting last quarter, or the potential of FSD becoming a cash cow with the full rollout in NA still happening this year.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 05:32:28'] Super oversold. If not for musk, everyone would agree. Assuming you look at the data, and think the trend will continue. And unlike other tech companies tesla has shown no sign of slowing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 04:12:56'] $140 EOY, sub-$100 mid-Q1.But yeah, it might bounce, eventually‚Ä¶someday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 01:09:59'] Sure, it could bounce, but I expect them to slowly bleed in the next several years. Competition is getting more fierce year by year and they are losing more and more EV market share in the matured EV markets (Europe, China). It is simply still too overvalued and losing its early bird advantage.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 02:40:32'] Musk‚Äôs don‚Äôt bounce
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 03:28:13'] It was technically oversold in mid-October, you got a mild bounce before it cratered. Briefly technically oversold again in early November, bounced somewhat and then cratered again. It's now just about technically oversold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 06:53:08'] It really depends on insitutions whether they want to dump the stock the next few weeks for year end losses or consider it has upside potential.  Tsla is running 97% of riskier than S&P 500 index. Fundamentals appears to be in a strong bearish trend. Shares are below a declining 200-day moving average and the MACD is beneath its signal line. I am on the fence.

So many people thought it was over-priced then, and so many people think it‚Äôs over-priced now. Downvote me all you want, bears üêª I totally agree those saying that if it‚Äôs important to you for to be profitable on TSLA within the next 1-3 years, then don‚Äôt trade it. Only invest what you can in TSLA, hoping it will rocket soon, but be willing to wait several years if your money temporarily gets cut in half. I‚Äôve had my money cut in half again & again on the TSLA ride.I‚Äôd recommend watching some [Tesla Daily](https://m.youtube.com/c/TeslaDaily).

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 13:23:08'] Yes and no. Is it money you want to put into a house within the next 3 years? Then no. Is your time horizon for the money 5-10 years? Then yes, it likely can make a lot of sense. Do not speculate with money that you "need". Not necessarily need to survive, but need for whatever it is that you are planning on purchasing, like a car or a house. At the current price, though, the stock is \~40x earnings, and about 30-35x forward earnings. Given that the company is growing at a 50% CAGR and has room to continue to do that for at least the next 5 years, it is extremely undervalued.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 20:52:26'] Tesla was my first stock purchase. I bought because I believe in the technology despite misgivings about the founder. My dad‚Äôs friends ‚Äútrade‚Äù and kept telling him I should sell pre-split because it was overvalued. I thanked them for the suggestion. I did sell a portion at one point to cover the initial investment and the taxes. What remains is just profit so I plan to just chill in the cut. If it does well - cool. If not, it‚Äôs been a hell of a ride. Dad‚Äôs friend called today to tell my parents the stock price. I chuckled. I only have a few shares so I doubt it‚Äôll end up being anything to write home about. But here we are.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 07:23:10'] With the fear of downvotes...  It seems like Toyota's market value is about $250 billion. For Tesla to live up to the market value it has today, it will have to become 4x the company that Toyota is today.  Can't help but feel like I'm watching Tulips being passed around.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 13:21:49'] I have believed in Tesla for several years, and I have on the dot, held their stock all the time except whenever they fucking spiked. It is uncanny, every time I think, looks like they are heading down, they have been stable forever, I sell them and think I will just buy them at a little lower price they spike, every fucking time. When they hit the low earlier this year I bought a whole bunch, and waited for them to recover, and they seemed to have no end in sight and all the other car companies seems to be catching up, with rivian and the electric hummer and F150 getting rave reviews and hype, along with their solar business seemingly forgotten, i though ok, Tesla isn‚Äôt going to reverse course anytime soon and sold the last one a week ago. The movement I sold that last stock it shot up. If you believe in a company, hold it, never sell it

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 22:27:24'] This has been my single biggest day of gains. Ended up with 20K gains. I don't normally watch the tickers in real time. I just buy and hold. Today my eyes were on my second monitor all day. Everytime the RSI started rocketing I would start laughing in joy. It's been a while since I've experienced something like that. I levereged every dollar I could last year to maximize my position. I'm currently sitting at 1/4 million and 80% is TSLA. I wish I bought more during covid but I literally had no more cash.Also daily reminder: Tesla isn't just an auto company. They are an energy, AI company that happens to be able to apply their knowledge in the auto industry, for now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 08:56:39'] Tesla is not a car company. They are an energy and innovation company. It's the reason I bought post IPO and still the reason I load on dips.Their fabrication process alone is decades ahead of anyone. The actual materials they have created are massive breakthroughs. Once you stop thinking it as a car company, you will understand the valuation and more importantly their contribution to humanity.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 09:29:04'] Buy LUCID early, start to average in at these levels it is going to be the preferred EV
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 10:38:29'] It's due for a split or burst soon. The company is incredibly overvalued IMO. Especially if it hits $2k then you'll see a big sell off probably from Cathy and ARK who said they would dump all their shares if it hits $2k. Other than that Tesla cars appeal to a very small niche of customers. A lot of people are still brand loyal to other auto makers especially Ford and GM. Plus with Tesla still ignoring NTSB requests and with how their cows remain poorly made and expensive. I think Tesla will drop off in the coming years especially as other auto makers release their EV fleets.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 12:05:14'] I wonder if this will be the catalyst for another massive bull run for tsla. Will it go up to $1200-1300 this week? Typically when TSLA breaks an ATH it tends to run on momentum, I can see this thing going up another 30% before it settles down. I can't ever be mad at TSLA though I held from 200 pre-split to 800 post-split. Would have been nice to still have those shares but I sold over 6 months ago and have had better plays.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 11:26:40'] Been overvalued since before the split.  Won't take a short position though because legions of cult-like fanboys will keep buying, no matter what the fundamentals

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 18:51:07'] Tesla is a $1T tech company that makes autos.When Tesla ran in to a chip shortage they were able to adapt and switch their software interface to handle a different option. Other auto manufacturers in the same position have to cease production.This is just one example of them being a Tech company.  Just like with Paypal, Elon didn't start the company, but he has found his way to tremendous success anyway.  I suppose there is no accounting for taste or style but the guy knows how to build a company.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 12:59:44'] Will keep saying it, and possibly continue to be wrong, but I would be terrified to own this stock and I worry for those who do at valuations like this. TSLA could easily drop 80-90% and from what I've seen a lot of TSLA investors seem to weight their portfolios heavily in TSLA and various EV-adjacent stocks.Congrats to everyone who owns the stock though - especially if you got in around the time of the split. Just make sure you can weather the less optimistic times which are sure to come sooner or later. Half of investing is holding stocks when they go up, the other half is making sure to get out before they go to zero - which with enough time, they all eventually do.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 01:56:54'] I like Tesla but its valuation is out there where it needs for everyone to buy Tesla products at the scale of apple almost. Its limited by the big tech companies on the list because if it surpasses those then its a full blown bubble stock at that point so its risk and rewards aren't as attractive where I can just own Apple or any of the other big tech and some are reasonable in valuation too. You might as well own SPY instead of Tesla. Perfect example of "I like the company but not the stock".

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 06:22:19'] I think this is just a mini-tech bubble because interest rates are low.  While Tesla may never crash 80% like a 2000 stock, it's going to definitely crash, once QE slows and interest rises.

Same shit was said before every bubble burst, like Amazon went from $106 to $6/Intel from \~$70 to $13 after the dotcom bubble burst.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 07:00:11'] I have recently gained the investment thesis that the market is never ‚Äúovervalued,‚Äù rather it is what it is. There are catalysts that drive the price down 10-20% equating to a correction but that usually doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the fundamentals or technicals. The market will continue to be valued at where it‚Äôs valued as long as the market is an auction-based market.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 07:30:28'] Tesla did not ‚Äúbreeze‚Äù to this valuation. This latest bump is all about Hertz‚Äôs recent buy of 100k units. The impact goes beyond that massive direct sale though. There‚Äôs a saying in the car sales biz: ‚ÄúThe feel of the wheel seals the deal.‚Äù Hertz, by and large, serves an upper income clientele, the same people who can afford Tesla automobiles. Since they divested their showrooms, Tesla has to have been ‚Äúwalking some sales‚Äù to customers who cannot fathom buying a car without driving in first.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 20:46:30'] Everything these days are idiotic and it's because of runaway money printing. Valuations are ridiculous for everything from stocks, to housing, to doge coins. Tax paying no longer matters because the government can simply print more money when they run out. Who is dumb enough to buy treasury bonds when you know 10 years later they hold half the value and pay shit in dividends. So people are taking more risk to buy stocks and who cares if it's a company that generates 1/10th the revenue but have 10x the market cap. Stocks are now valued based on popularity or something else. Cryptocurrencies are idiotic as well. They're only used as a mean for the rich to hedge the money they conned off of the middle and lower class. There is no incentives for the average person to be miners because your chance of being awarded a bitcoin or any coin is practically 0. So much for decentralizing money. The mining rigs consume more energy than two refrigerators and loud  AF. It's expensive as hell to buy and if you get fished or forgot your password or broke your wallet, it is lost to the ether. An idiotic way to hedge inflation but there's fewer alternatives. Then you have a fundamental investor like Warren Buffet saying gold, which has been used for millenniums, has little use. Then you have over priced housing thanks to Trump unemployment money. A $300 grand house get you a new home with basic cheap everything. Then they drive up the demand because investors are just putting down 5% on a house and buying 5 of them to rent out. F the idiotic money printing. F the idiocy in the world. It's just people conning other people to get rich.

POST_TEXT: b'  \n\nTeslas stock (TSLA) is surging higher ahead of its shareholders voting on a stock split later this week. The company announced its intentions to do a stock split back in March 2022. And last month, Tesla revealed its intentions for a 3-for-1 stock split, if approved by shareholders. The vote is coming up at Teslas annual shareholders meeting on Thursday, August 4.'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:33:32'] In your position, with not being able to wait because of credit, I would sell at a loss.The psychological uncertainty would make my life significantly worse.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 01:46:12'] Hope is NOT a strategy!If you can absorb further losses without having to sell other stocks, your car or your house, it really depends on whether you still believe in the company‚Äôs earnings prospects compared to the current stock price. Why did you buy that Tesla stock in the first place? Selling a stock solely because it has turned south should seldom make you want to sell unless the management is facing prison for fraud or something like that.If you can‚Äôt absorb further losses I‚Äôd sell right now and rethink the whole situation. You have been gambling and not investing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:49:49'] Nothing wrong with taking loss. In fact rookie mistake is being a bag holder. It's called opportunity cost. Bag holding is lost opportunity. Let's say for example you have 10k you bought tesla with all of it and it's now worth 7.5k. You sell now you have that to play with. If you find a better position you could make back your 25 percent and move on. If you bag hold you are stuck could be years before that bag changes. Most likely the case in your scenario. In every loss I've taken the sooner I did it the better.  It hurts but it's part of investing
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 22:12:50'] The question to answer is always the same: Imagine you're at 100% cash. Based on what you know today, would you invest it in your current portfolio?If the answer is "yes" - hold.If the answer is "no" - change to the portfolio you think is the best given what you know today.For me personally, the drop in TSLA has everything to do with the macro environment and nothing to do with the company. Tesla is still extremely profitable. Growing above 50% YoY. Still very much in the lead of a major major global tech revolution. So, IMHO, TSLA is a great investment. Even more so at the lower prices.You can look at [Piper Sandler's DCT with PT if $1350](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FLg1QzXX0AEM2U9?format=jpg&name=orig) or [Gary Black's with PT of $1600](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1489188830418722819) if you want to see how the numbers work out.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 19:16:47'] Since its on margin, you should just take your L here. Tesla has downside still, and it‚Äôs probably just the beginning of riskier plays getting beat down. And learn the lesson too. If you dont see the lesson to be learned here than I recommend thoroughly rethinking why you‚Äôre investing, and how youre going to do it from now on.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:20:57'] If you have a 100 shares buy a protective put against your shares another year or so out. If you‚Äôre scared of the SHOP effect, take the loss and buy a near the money call a year out and include that investment as part of your loss. Then hold or redeploy your capital somewhere you feel safer. TSLA can easily be a 650-700 stock and also back to 1100. And not a single person can predict it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 18:30:14'] sell enough to get out of margin and then just sit and wait. It'll go back up within a year or two as the PE continues to be reduced from both ends.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 22:48:41'] JUST SELL ALL TESLA and buy less speculative stocks! The buying volume has been very low, and most overvalued rocket stocks have come back to earth. Even Facebook got thrashed, it‚Äôs market cap is much smaller than Teslas, yet it makes three times more money. Try to figure that one out.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 04:01:24'] When the market goes in peoples‚Äô favour, they call themselves traders. However, when the market isn‚Äôt so hot and they‚Äôre in the red, many suddenly become investors :D. Ultimately, the decision is up to you and no one should advise you otherwise. Do you trade? Or do you invest? That should be enough to help you make your decision.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 05:13:00'] I would would take the L if you‚Äôre in need of funds. Things still might get worse for high valuation stocks when the Federal Reserve makes their big announcement or when/if Russia invades Ukraine.Good luck with everything though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 09:44:04'] 2 choices I see:1) close position, take remaining funds and re-stratgize for a very LONG position elsewhere.  Diversify.2) Close credit position and eat that loss.  Keep cash position tsla long, if you think TSLA will recover in years to come Tsla recover? I personally dont think so, its too detached from fundamentals, the days of speculation tech are over.I think its done dumping (for now) but its hard to say as it trades as a tech company when it should trade as a hybrid between car and tech.  I feel it should have a Price to book ratio of just under 10:1.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 09:45:01'] Sell whatever you need, to cover the credit. Keep the rest. Also stop trying to trade with money that you cant afford to loose. In fact just don't trade short term period, its a game you cant win in the long run. Just buy good companies and hold. But I am sure you already heard that before so now its just a matter of discipline
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 20:08:58'] My take on TSLA‚Ä¶ first and foremost, I honestly believe it‚Äôs not going anywhere and in 10 years it will remain a top 5 US company. All of this being said, I don‚Äôt know that it will stay Top 5 on the way there. Yeah I know‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not just a car company, it‚Äôs AI, solar, energy, robotaxis, robots, insurance, you name it. The fact remains that today it‚Äôs 95% a car company that sells only 2 real cars, plus a handful of S and X vehicles. All other aspects of their business are either pipe dreams, years away from solo profitability, or regulatory nightmares. The long game is probably quite strong for Tesla but the short game is tough. The way I look at it, it‚Äôs about a $900B company today, let‚Äôs ask what needs to happen to get it to $2T? I think a lot needs to go right over the next 5 years to get there. I think it does get to $2T or even $3T over time, but what is that time and risk worth for 2-3x upside that isn‚Äôt guaranteed. Let me give you a real world example. I‚Äôve been heavy in Apple for a very long time. When they were a $1T company I sold a solid chunk of shares and diversified out into a lot of safer bets. Today Apple is a $3T company and those investments are up about 75% being diversified out. Would I have made more staying put? Sure but the risk wasn‚Äôt worth it. Not sure how much of your portfolio is in Tesla at $1100, but if it‚Äôs more than 20%, maybe consider why.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 19:00:10'] I'm a diehard Tesla bull and I highly recommend you to get off the marginShort term, there are lots of headwinds that could send $TSLA way down. One of my biggest concerns right now is China losing containment of the COVID Omicron variant. Hong Kong has [just lost control](https://amp.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3167718/hong-kong-health-minister-says-social-distancing) and will be going into full lockdown soon. I personally don't think anyone can contain Omicron without resorting to economically ruinous measures, but China might continue its "Zero COVID" policy regardless. Imagine how much $TSLA will go down if GF Shanghai is shut down for several weeks...
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:24:44'] Dude, you invested in an insanely overvalued car company after a massive run up. It still has massive downside risk in an incredibly shaky market, yes you should cut your loses. The fact that you used margin means you should exit sooner rather than later.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 16:41:03'] I‚Äôd say sell but that‚Äôs because i think a purchase price of $1000 per share is bonkers for TSLA

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:29:53'] In my opinion TSLA is way over valued. I think it‚Äôs a great company but the stock went up about 11X from 2019 - 2021 and the actual value of the company did not match that. Stock price is not solely based on intrinsic value of course but in the highly volatile (dare I say bearish) market that we are bound to be in for the first half of this year it is a good indicator of how a stock price might perform. If you can hold for the long term (1+ years) then I would say go for it, you will probably make money (especially if Tesla does a split which will certainly drive up the stock price).  If you can‚Äôt buckle up and hold for over a year then you might as well sell. We are not in a good market for growth stock right now and it‚Äôs a total gamble trying to predict if things will get better or worse in the near future with everything going on. Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 18:31:43'] It would be best to take the L because I don‚Äôt see it going back to 1100 anytime soon. I am a firm believer that TSLA will go back to 1100 but not for a bit. Probably 2023 or later.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 22:51:47'] As more people get margin calls it snowballs and down the hill it goes. Big money can see exactly who and how much is short and when they get margin calls. They can and will short it down to force you out and take your shares on the cheap on the way down. I was in that situation once and sold shares in my winners to cover a margin call due to a stock that was getting hammered. It was touch and go for a week but the hammered stock came back and I'm glad I held it. My winners I sold to cover margin call also dropped after I sold and I was able to buy back for about 10% less.  This was during the covid drop. I was down to $189k from $750k and on margin call. By shuffling stocks I got through it and up to $890k now.  Lesson learned. I never go that deep in margin now. About 50% cash now waiting for Russia war crash to play out and get back in.     As far As TSLA I stay away at these prices. I feel TSLA is priced like they are the only EV play there is. All car companies going EV and theri share prices are all too high due to the EV bubble. As far as I see they are all double where they should be. Several small EV companies are in play too now. Due to the competition and low profit on EVs I have no doubt sales of EVs will be high but profits will be low. If TSLA thinks they have the market to themselves they are mistaken. GM and Ford are coming up strong.  When I buy my first EV it will be GM or Ford. My fun EV will be a corvette or mustang. At some point TSLA will crash like FB. Right now TSLA is priced like they are the only EV maker in the world and all other car makers will do gas cars forever.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 22:59:10'] Take the L. Margin is no joke and can wipe you out on an unexpected downturn, specially if you‚Äôre already in the red. Thats why when margin buying its good to have a target and a stop loss set, going in naked is usually not a good idea. Even if Tesla goes up eventually I wouldn‚Äôt kick myself over it, you are potentially avoiding a bullet by not being over exposed in a time of high volatility.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 05:43:54'] January-February will be known as the Great Margin Collapse. So many traders are getting called because they went balls deep thinking they caught the dip but they caught the trend change....I kid, market will be sideways for a little while but I don't think it'll break lows, you better get out of margin on the next pump
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 05:52:08'] Margin is really useful to continuing trading while your funds are settling, never leaving the bounds of what you can repay.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 06:05:17'] short term idiot lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 07:33:35'] 1000-1200 are good sell areas for TSLA. Next support is somewhere around 400-600 so that would be a good buy area. You could sell now, and buy back the shares when it hits 500.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 07:57:14'] Let me guess didn't sell at 1200 and paid the price now?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 08:11:05'] Margin is not a bad thing if used in the right way. I just haven't figured out the right way yet. I am not a seasoned investor so don't take my advice as "the word". My 2cents.If you have 100+ shares, bring it down to 100. Sell covered call leaps on the 100 shares you own. Be very very disciplined with this. Don't panic or don't try to overdo this. You can also look at repair strategy but discuss with someone who knows this first.If you have less than 100. I would still sell a few shares and book a loss. Hold the rest for long term (2+ years)Meanwhile do a lot of research on TSLA. Follow the stock well. Go deep so you have a good understanding of both the stock and the sector. Tsla has a lot of problems other than Elon Musk but it still is a pioneer ev stock.Also, do a rethink of your portfolio. How much is ETF, good tech stocks, volatile stocks, gold ETF, bonds ETF etc. Good luck. May the market force be with you!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 08:19:11'] How can anyone lose money with Tesla?Just buy more. Take advantage of the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 09:16:33'] Tesla moves very fast and you can be looking at 1200 in 2 weeks, or 800...not helpful, but you didn't tell us what other stonks you hold....so you have to choose the ones that have the greatest potential...historically TSLA has great to potential to react quickly to market forces.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 09:52:25'] Are you OK trading options? If so, sell an ITM call, say 18th March 800c. That way you can reduce your loss and sell getbrid of the stock. If the stock falls below 800, you get to keep the premium and write another ITM call. Downside with this strategy is potential loss if Tesla shoots up, which I dont think will happen given the current matket scenario I assume you have atleast 100 stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-22 07:11:02'] Unconventional opinion, hold.1. The single most important thing to gain out of this is the ability to withstand pain when everything is going wrong. Selling at a loss is cheating yourself out of that experience.2. Based on your responses, you still believe the company is strong and is likely to hop back up to 1100 eventually. Maybe not in 6 months, but eventually.3. If you hold and get margin called for everything, it is about a ~$10-20k lesson in not making an idiotic play like that. You can come back from that with salary and future investments. Everyone has had a lesson or two like this, and this is yours.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 02:53:50'] Unless you're a short term trader (read: gambler), you'd be a fool to sell Tesla. For the first time in the company's history, it's starting to become cheaply valued if you account for growth, and the risks with the company are smaller than ever. Tesla has never, not even back when it was $100 just before it shot up to $900, looked this appealing. The risk/reward at the current valuation is insane. Imo the risk it goes down throughout this decade is close to 0, the chance it goes at least 3x is extremely large, there's still a very fair chance it goes 10x and if all the crazy AI stuff (FSD/Tesla bot/Autobidder/Dojo) works out the upside is unimaginable.All of that said, this is the risk of using margin. Your decision is not whether you should sell Tesla, but whether you should continue to be on margin. That has nothing to do with the company and everything to do with the meta and your mental wellbeing, and is exactly the reason why you should never use margin for (long term) investing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:16:24'] I'm of the opinion that Tesla is ludicrously overvalued.  So obviously I'd sell it if I were in your shoes.But go back to why you bought it.  Why do you think Tesla's grows from here?  Keep in mind that massive growth is already priced in, so they need to basically make every car on the road or their other sidelines have to become that big for it to hit it's current valuation.ETA: And for the love of God, margin is one of the only ways you can lose MORE than your investment.  Don't mess with it generally, but especially on a volatile stock.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 20:52:01'] Why would you sell tesla? Think about that it just started making money and is becoming a cash king. Are you listening to other people? Look at Shopify only a moron would sell Shopify or tesla at a lose with so much good in the company

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:04:59'] TSLA - is it going to be a bigger company in the future? My bet is yes. What I‚Äôd do is if it cuts in half...double the investment. If its cuts another in half...add the same amount. Repeat. Provided this is an amount of portfolio appropriate to the risk.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 19:03:20'] Nobody here really knows what‚Äôs gonna happen with this market or Tesla stock. We are all just guessing. My guess is that Tesla ends the year higher than now. But that doesn‚Äôt mean much haha.

If you're a long term investor, i'm not sure why you're concerned.You'll notice lately that Tesla has been bouncing between $850-1000 MULTIPLE times, so if you are indeed short term, wait for a higher bounce closer to $1000 and cut your losses.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 17:51:57'] If leveraged, you were a dummy on this one and made a mistake, and will probably need to cut your losses.  If you don't owe interest on your buy, then hold, it'll probably be higher than ever in 5-10 years most likely.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 21:01:19'] TSLA is very expensive for where it's at now. Such stocks can ignore gravity and go up and to the right, but only when the market is in a dreamy bull mode. In the current mood, it's more likely that the market would conclude that TSLA will never become very profitable, and drive its price back towards where it was two years ago. Say, 50% that TSLA would claw it's way back to $1000 or even $1100, and 50% that it would do a few 20-30% drops to the $100-$200 range.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-21 05:51:39'] I would exit the TSLA position. You are hoping that it rebounds, not expecting that it will. You are working from emotion.Chances are, you knew that it had an outlandish valuation when you jumped in. Could it go higher? Enough where you don't just recoup your loss, but actually profit? Absolutely.I don't follow Tesla, but I'll risk the ire of Elon's fans: An early lead is great, and not all the bit players in the EV space will pan out, but the days of Tesla deriving all its income from selling carbo credits to the big automakers are numbered.

Even if I was a TSLA bull and believed Tesla would be the biggest company ever, I'd see how macro has more impact on the price in 1-2 years term. With Fed being hawkish this year and a lot of uncertainty in the market, TSLA still has a lot of downside. If you're bullish and can handle TSLA going to let's say 500, holdIf you aren't bullish, maybe buy some index funds after selling it

You could sell a portion and take the loss, but hang onto a small portion. I think TSLA is a stock that you want to hold for for the next 10-20 years. After so many splits and years of growth you may be shocked at how much it‚Äôs worth. But that‚Äôs not to say it should be a large position.Edit: wtf you bought on margin? Yeah... idk what to tell you then. Knowing the right answer would require knowing the short-term behavior. And no one knows that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 19:57:50'] Imo TSLA is 100% overvalued by light years still, but that doesn't mean too much if enough major institutional money plans to prop it up (it is a USA co.) and it can prove rapid growth over a few more years that stays massively ahead of competition.   Beyond ARK, not sure who has large holdings in it (Pelosi excluded here). Regardless, I made it a point that I'd stay away unless it sees $420 again, but also not daring to bet on that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 20:05:23'] I think it will bounce back a little next week when the Putin drama dies down (and then drop again when it flares back up). Maybe back to $950. I‚Äôd sell enough to get out of margin, but keep the rest. It‚Äôs still an exciting stock to hold for the future! Do you happen to have 100 shares? You can make $5k+ selling a covered call.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-20 21:27:47'] Depending on how many shares you hold, if it‚Äôs many, I‚Äôd look into selling covered calls and make regular income utilizing your shares as collateral.If you are willing to sell at a loss anyway, if the price indeed rises above the share price, you will be forced to sell 100 shares per contract but it more money than just taking a loss.Depending on the strike you sell, you could sell indefinitely bringing in weekly/ monthly income

Not to mention how he was just handed the perfect proof of concept for Starlink on a silver platter while doing some good in the world to boot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 08:15:07'] Biggest risk is China. China is a de facto ally to Russia and gave its blessing to Putin for the invasion. Musk will turn tail as soon as China says so.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-27 08:24:01'] Tesla doesn't have a large market share in the first place, they certainly don't have a very big one in Russia period (their biggest market I believe is Norway).  I can't see Space-X providing a few internet dishes to Ukraine having any real impact on Tesla.  If anything it will be a great promotion for Starlink.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-26 21:51:10'] I am not sure whether Tesla will get any backlash from russian for helping Ukraine. I do think that TSLA is going to take a dive soon though after the investigation into Elon and his brother doing insider trading ([https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949453/tesla-elon-musk-kimbal-sec-investigation-insider-trading](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/24/22949453/tesla-elon-musk-kimbal-sec-investigation-insider-trading)) and both I and Elon think Tesla is waaaaay overvalued and it is ([https://fortune.com/2022/02/02/tsla-stock-valuation-predictions-2022/](https://fortune.com/2022/02/02/tsla-stock-valuation-predictions-2022/) ). I think $250/share makes sense for the next few years but nowhere close to being worth $800/share. Sadly, if TSLA does take a dive it'll take a good chunk of SPY with it.

S. spending our tax dollars on other nations problems. But some things are not about money! Elon Musk started Tesla as a means to an end so he could find Space X. Which was really for the good of all man kind. His move to open starlink for the Ukraine is what I would say a humanitarian effort. Think what you want, but Putin has a goal. His goal is to make Russia the greatest superpower in the world. As history has proven others have had this inspiration as well, like Hitler for instance. No matter the effect on the Tesla stock price or whatever bad politics this move might create for Elon down the road. Who cares, the stock will rebound.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:12:37'] They are larger in market cap than Intel, AMD and TSMC combined. Of course they are overvalued. Intel spends double on R&D. TSMC makes their chips. Nvidia's entire market cap is built up because some engineers decided to allow people to use their cards more directly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:59:26'] I think it's carried by sentiment. There are people who don't look at fundamentals but think " it's a great company with a great future" which buy stock. They are not wrong, but leave out price in their analysis.Right now is the perfect time to fomo NVDA.Some people are great at trading on sentiment and make a killing, because they time right. Others are just lucky. I suspect most of the current retail NVDA investors will stand in the rain somewhere down the road.I held NVDA briefly, bought at 200, sold at 220. No regrets. I am not that good being long on sentiment. Makes me itchy. I don't have to be there for every party.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:24:30'] To be fair to the bulls, it's not like this is a hype stock that has no earnings and is just pure magic in the air. There is a strong underlying business with good fundamentals. The question now is whether the price reflects a fair value that you should pay for that business.Despite the YoY revenue declines, I think once the economy emerges the other side of this inflation battle, that downtrend will have been temporary. However I do think this stock is being priced to perfection, and the expected growth argument I've seen from multiple bulls is that this price action brings it into line with other big Tech (P/E in the 25 region or so). This growth argument is expecting all of the chips falling Nvidia's way (excuse the pun) over the medium term which in my view is highly optimistic. I can see this stock pulling back back but I think the days of this being a below $200 stock may be over unless economic shit hits the fan.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:19:26'] Hundreds of companies were objectively more overvalued than Nvidia is now less than 3 years ago, so you are being a bit dramatic when you say that you‚Äôve never seen this in your life.

You can be as bullish as it comes to the electric car future and still not value Tesla like it's already making a gazillion cars a year. You can be as bullish as it comes on AI without currently valuing NVDA like it's already cornered the market and is printing money like the Fed. A head start in a new frontier is not a guaranteed thing. If a recession hits, NVDA will be one of the first things investors sell off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:53:21'] Let‚Äôs do the math. The CAGR of datacenter revenue was 51% without a blockbuster use case. We have now have that blockbuster use case. Gross margins are trending towards 70%. Datacenter TAM is $600B, for now there is no substitute for nvidia gpus for AI workloads. If AI is that important can nvidia garner 10-30% of that TAM, then you get $100B in Datacenter revenue, $20 eps, 20-25x earnings multiple. It‚Äôs just that easy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 10:07:36'] AI is already being hailed as the next world-changing technology, a step change from what has come before. As an comparison, think about the invention of the the smartphone and the internet. It's too early to tell who exactly will stand to gain most from the new paradigm, but NVDA is the obvious pick-and-shovels play for investors with a decade plus time horizon. At this point Wall Street basically doesn't care about the current valuation and will buy every dip possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 11:34:34'] I've been buying Nvidia pretty consistently from 2020 till end of 2022.  I haven't bought more this year.  I view it as 10 year investment horizon, and I didn't really care what financials looked like.  I believe in the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/5-stages-of-the-hype-cycle) idea.  During that time period, I also worked for a VC growth accelerator program; so I'm biased to ideas that I've seen pitched.  But the new markets created that benefits Nvidia:* Generative AI (current hype wave), AND I also think there will 'Models-As-A-Service' that will likely emerge that will disrupt current SAAS businesses (future hype train)* Metaverse (current Trough of Disillusion).  As generative AI gets easier and better (art then video then 3D objects); then Metaverse can happen.  It's no secret even way back then, that Apple was also looking into the space.* Crypto-Blockchain -  (current Trough of Disillusion); another big bull run will eventually happen within the next 10 years.* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    I don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen.

Was their market timing suboptimal?  Absolutely.But were they right and still made tons of money?  Yes.  Does it matter THAT much they bought in the 50s / high 40s vs. $25?  Not really even though it felt like a painful drop.People are betting that this is the horse of the future.  Time will only tell if they end up looking like geniuses or fools but either way humanity will benefit massively from the ridiculous flow of capital to AI.

I see it finishing the year at around $300 per share although as with anything I could be wrong. I stupidly sold the other chip stock that went up today (AMD) the other week in the $90s although I did sell a majority of my AMD holdings at $155 in 2021. Also stupidly sold NVIDIA in the early 200s towards the end of last year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:12:41'] There is a possibility it is overvalued for a hardware business, but this is one of those where it is not nearly as obvious as everyone thinks it is. You are not looking at future financial profile - not unrealistic to think GMs hit 70% next year with the unprecedented demand. Is it sustainable, who knows?If the AI train is not all hype (and for those paying attention, there‚Äôs reasons to think it‚Äôs not), then this will be downright cheap. If you can provide the raw tools that enable you to create 10 billion workers out of thin air, a 1 trillion valuation will look laughable. Remember, the majority of economic value accrues to businesses which provide the picks and shovels. Even if it is hype, NVDA benefits from hype alone. This is the same issue with those who were screaming TSLA was so overvalued when it was between $100-$500bn in market cap. You have to look at it on a forward basis and be a little thoughtful.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 06:13:03'] I just buy stocks that I like and use in real life.

Also AI, I've read about how they're looking forward in that regard and I am using AI more and more. Not much thought past that tbh. I'll be working and investing for the next 40 years, so the recent downtrends will hopefully just be a good time to buy up.  I'm starting with risky stocks, will then move into sectors like recycling and waste management, then ETFs and less risky stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 03:03:27'] IMHO Nvidia is only so big as there is was not a serious competitor in the last years. The take over of ATI by AMD in 2006 was the biggest present for Nvidia as AMD started to struggle and started to cut down all R&D budgets leading to about 10 years of development gap between them. But Intel and AMD are making progress so it is possible that Nvidia will not be in that position in a few years anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 14:09:07'] Nvidia owns the AI hardware market. More AI developers use their GPUs and software toolkits than any other, by a wide margin.The dominant leader in a market tends to support inflated valuations for extended periods of time.Until recently we would never imagine Google losing its dominance in the search market. The lead that Amazon has in being a global marketplace is practically insurmountable. Say what you want about Tesla and competition, but they have an insurmountable lead in software development and the vast amounts of data required to cement their leadership.These "cream of the crop" companies are rare and every institution wants to hold them.Is Nvidia "overvalued?" Sure. It was probably overvalued at $300. And it will be overvalued at $500 later this year.The market decides the value of a stock. The more we get hung up on questioning the rationality of the market, the more we miss opportunities.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 03:15:16'] It's just dumb to short NVDA because at best it's a great company that's overvalued. TSLA was literally going bankrupt a few years back, so it's not really a fair comparison.And while I'd argue it's massively overvalued relative to other tech valuations, it's probably not that overvalued if you believe they can achieve 50% growth rates for several years while maintaining 30-40% net profit margins. In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.I think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.Personally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price. With lots of companies now beginning to build their own AI-optimised chips I worry whether NVDA can defend their margins. If they execute well I think they probably can, but when you have a stretched valuation that's not really good enough.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 02:44:00'] Not saying they're not wildly overvalued but AMZN returned $6b to shareholders last year. NVDA returned over $10b whilst growing way faster. NVDA has much higher margins so I'm not surprised the valuation gap is narrowing. Also in terms of saturation, people don't realise NVDA makes a lot of money from software too. Enterprise/dev tools, GeForce Now etc.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 23:42:20'] Keep in mind Amazon is a garbage e-retailer. E-retailers have 1% margins, so that revenue sounds impressive but Amazon essentially makes no profit from any of it that came from selling things on Amazon. The cloud business is basically the only thing worth anything, and that‚Äôs getting to be a crowded space. You can no longer assume 60% compounded annually there. I honestly have no idea why amazon trades at the lofty levels it does.

Also, the A.I. believers think the revenue can grow 30% or more year over year for years to come. Again, I wouldn‚Äôt touch the stock now coz I don‚Äôt own it and it‚Äôs super expensive to buy, but hey these big fund managers have been buying NVDA for ages and I bet their avg cost is less than 100 bucks, would they want to sell now?

If he just randomly sold, he would get a lot of hate for that, but by doing it this way he:* Ties his sell-off to something that many people that support taxing billionaires would view in a positive light and therefore branding it in a popular way.* Puts the responsibility of the decision on to the people rather than himself even though he only did it this way because he knew how the vote would obviously go.* Gets to say "I told you so" when the government inevitably fails to do anything good with these tax dollars.* Gets more free publicity for Tesla out of it in the process.Absolute genius.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 01:39:08'] Tesla stock price is a huge shit show anyway. One more, one less - who cares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 02:03:21'] They should, yes, because Elon isn't doing this to produce value for the stockholders.If it was a stockholder vote, there would be a financial conflict of interest whereas a Twitter pole is somewhat more neutral.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 02:16:52'] I think he already decided to sell before he created the poll, knowing that "sell" would win. He would become a fucking god to all of those voters for following through, when that was the plan all along anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 02:18:32'] Well He can pull that it was your choice card later on

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 02:27:39'] Could not should. Buying into Tesla is also buying in to Elon.  If you don't know this you shouldn't have bought.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 03:20:47'] Just to get this right: If Elon owns 18% if Tesla, then he‚Äôs talking about a 1.8% stake. The market should absorb this easily.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 03:41:04'] Why didn't you take a short position?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 03:51:07'] I feel like everyone knew he was going to sell since last week. He's been saying it over and over again. He just made the poll to be edgy but he already knew he was going to do it. [Elon Tweet Timeline on Tiktok](https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdYWQ26M/)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 04:07:40'] When has Elon ever done anything which was not eccentric?  Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.  Look at Bitcoin advocacy reversal, the Hertz purchase, the SEC troubles.  He is a loose cannon but you gotta luv him (unless you have a lot of TESLA stock).
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 04:12:17'] Everyone should know that he was going to sell some stock anyways to exercise and pay the tax on his upcoming vesting stock tranches.Based on SEC rules he can‚Äôt just sell this much stock anyways without declaring it months in advance. Will see this transaction happen in a number of months or will find out this was already filed months ago. The poll is an illusion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 04:48:05'] Is it violation of any SEC rules ? Isn't it like an internal information?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 05:23:01'] If you haven‚Äôt noticed yet, Elon Musk is completely out of his mind.

That‚Äôs basically what his twitter account is for.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 07:05:39'] Musk was already going to sell his shares, he knows they'll vote yes so to lighten the news he decides to blame the decision on a Twitter poll. Nobody on wall Street is taking this seriously, they already knew. The real question is, where will that $22 billion go?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 11:43:11'] You do know he has to sell some shares anyway to pay a huge tax bill he's getting right? This was just a game/cover to make it look like to the idiots who aren't paying attention that he's not confident in Tesla or something when he sells....

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 12:59:00'] Elon probably thinks a crash will happen and the TSLA stock will go down so he decided to sell 10% of his Tesla stocks. He might sell more TSLA stock because the company is overvalued. He knows the stock can't keep going up and now it will go down, so it's not a bad time to sell TSLA stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:25:29'] Elon's simply proof the average investor has no brain. Also proof people are generally terrible at research. Anyone whos looked into his past knows hes a dumbfuck and a sociopath. X.com would simply seize cash from user accounts. Specifically targeting accounts they thought had too little for the user to be able to sue.I think my funniest Elon moment was when he was talking about how easy it would be to build the hyperloop "Its simple! Its basically an air hockey table!". Then a year later he admits its now just a "loop" and the train idea isn't happening...instead Teslas in tunnels! Behold Elons revolutionary tunnel. Crazy because the vacuum powered train concept is about 100 years old but he was going around acting like he came up with the concept. Spoiler: the idea has never worked.Then you got the Mars base by 2024 claim which you'd have to be an absolute moron to believe. I dont think it needs to be explained how dumb that is.Elons power is shill power. Its similar to Apple. This massive history of data leaks, including trying to charge a man with burglary for exposing an Apple run site that was freely giving out user information, but no one ever talks about that because everyone's invested in Apple.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-08 07:14:48'] I don‚Äôt think his point is to pander to stockholders. I think, and I am of course just speculating, he is grappling with doing the right thing for the world. He‚Äôs been highly criticized for not paying his fare share of taxes but is also probably conflicted with the fact he is trying to accomplish things for the world with these companies, like environmentally friendly tech and advancing space exploration, He seems to have some kind of guilt over his wealth, living in a 50k tiny home to make some kind of point.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:16:09'] He's basically doing it to avoid the impending 'war on billionaires,' which makes a lot of sense.By attempting to prove that he has no ulterior motive (for taxes or otherwise) in keeping billions and billions in unrealized assets, he's trying to paint himself as the nice guy or something. I sincerely doubt that this will affect Tesla's stock all too much. Besides it's valued on speculation beyond anything else.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:36:32'] Tesla is not a car company, it's a stock company. Elon Musk tweets an absurd thing > It's all over the media > it drives the stock of Tesla up. We're all familiar with this pattern, this tweet shouldn't be a surprise to anybody. Elon Musk has lied constantly throughout his career and will continue to lie until it stops putting money in his pocket, [here's a list of some](https://www.elonmusk.today/)
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:39:42'] It's not that absurd. He wanted to sell and he knew Twitter would vote yes. Now he gets to cash out without blame because now he can say "this is what my followers wanted".
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:40:55'] Funny thing is there's no dilution, just a days worth of shares changing hands in total while Elon still has 270M shares left after. He could sell 1M shares per day and nothing would change. Market will panic early but wouldn't be surprised if we close up. There's also short term catalysts such as October sales numbers, Berlin and Austin. Don't panic, buy the dip imho
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 13:42:04'] He has options which need to be exercised next year, so some sale of stock is inevitable. This dog and pony show makes it look like us regular folk had a say.  Also, can't see this negatively affecting the stock.  Even if share price drops, investors will rush in to buy the "dip".

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 14:23:43'] He's not actually caring about the poll imo. Rather, he's warming up his investors to the fact that he is selling 10% of his stock so Tesla doesn't crash when he does.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 14:23:47'] So TSLA at ATH, what would be the implications if he just dumped %10of his holdings without this poll.  Personally if you own something it's entirely one's choice to sell or not.  I think some shareholders would take it as the stock is poised for the pullback with a blind sale from Elon.  Thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 14:24:33'] I mean, at least he warned

It'll be a while before we need it, so I thought- what the hell- I should be able to make a quick buck instead of just leaving it in savings.  I deposited it to my brokerage account and I tried to buy 225 shares of TSLA at $1,115 or so thinking it would go back to $1200 in no time.  My broker blocked the sale because of the waiting period before I could use the funds.  I watched as the price went up a little bit so I was pissed.. then I watched it go down and down and down.. so even thought I could trade, I waited instead.  \n\nTLTR: My broker saved me from at least a $60k error because I couldn't use the funds when I wanted to."

That is so incredibly risky. 250k can be used as another downpayment in the future, to pay off debts, to buy a new car (if you need one), take a decent vacation when covid settles down, among much more. But YOLOing it all on such a volatile stock is beyond reckless

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 14:38:20'] Serious question, would you still feel this way if rallies to $1,100 over the coming weeks? Would you still make this post? I invest in index funds and a handful of stocks, of which Tesla is my largest non-index position. Days like today aren't fun but they're par for the course. If you can't handle the volatility then it's probably not for you and that's absolutely ok! There's a reason I'm not all in on Tesla. I follow the company very closely and regardless of Reddit  ~~groupthink~~ opinion, have extremely high conviction and believe it be a very safe 5+ year holding. Yes, I know this will ruffle feathers here. I have my rules for buying/selling Tesla and I'm never put in a situation where I must give up my shares. Bottom line, I look at everything from a rules-based and LONG term perspective and work within that framework. Looking at month to month, or in this case day to day movement of an inherently irrational market won't do you or anyone any favors.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 20:14:27'] The bull case for Tesla is that Elon will say and do anything within the grey margins of legality to pump the stock. He will introduce some vapourware years from being ever built to get the price moving. He will make some announcement about the Cybertruck that is years from being produced. Tesla stock is such a solid bet, just because of Elon.

Tesla is almost universally recognized by investors as pretty expensive which is why you get a beat on earnings and good guidance and the stock still fell off a cliff.

Once it drops to a price that you think is likely near to bottom, sell the short call and put leaps for profits, and wait for reversal.If succeed, earn money both ways. If failed, you sacrifice a small sum of money to give you a chance to buy TSLA much cheaper than now.

I would rather buy into ETFs in way smaller portions over many months and do some really proper research (based on the knowledge you have to acquire first to do so) on them before. At pages like https://backtest.curvo.eu you can compare your ETF choices with the FTSE All World and the MSCI along others. Make sure to understand the comparisons really properly and understand that they don‚Äôt tell you anything about the future. 250k isn‚Äôt that much. It is a lot but not in relation to the spendings in your lifespan. Make sure that ETFs or shares are the right investment choice. But yeah, lucky you!

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:13:46'] I don't necessarily have any evidence for this, but I feel like FAANG and other earlier tech companies focused on their core product/capability/differentiator and perfected it before building their companies into tech giants.It feels like today's tech giants (Uber, Zillow, etc.) try to go about things backwards - they enter the market with a shiny, new, disruptive product and then proceed to hire, hire, hire, raise capital very aggressively and build tons of new features. Then when economic headwinds or new challenges come around, we find that they've overbuilt their companies and haven't even figured out how to make their core product profitable. Amazon figured out how to make money selling books. THEN they built out their company and explored other capabilities.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:09:52'] Long long ago startups used to go IPO to market to get money for expansion, and as companies grew so did their stocks. Now we have a model where private angel investors or VCs invest in startups, pump up their revenues even giving Cashback to customers to increasing revenues but never actually making profit. With artificially pumped up revenue they bloat up company valuations and goto IPO pocketing all the cream and leaving retails as bag holders for decades to justify the valuations.all companies you listed fall into that category

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:30:31'] True tech stocks have what is called operating leverage.  That is, they can dramatically increase revenues without increasing overhead at the same rate.  That is why true software companies (such as Microsoft) are so profitable.Uber and Zillow did not have true operating leverage, so they haven't seen the massive growth in profitability.Musk was smart about TSLA.  He realized that vehicle manufacturing had to show operating leverage (high gross margins) or his stock story would fall apart.  That's why he took several gambles along the way to scale up fixed costs (Austin, Berlin, Shanghai) in order to enable much higher production.  He has famously spent almost nothing on advertising, and they have not refreshed their vehicle models very much which keeps fixed investments very low.Regarding "AI" (or more specifically LLM AI), the thought is that with enough capex in LLM's, there will be new markets opened for generative AI to displace existing services (search and advertising) or human workers.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 10:40:15'] Investors poured money into the "network effect" where users = long term value. Second wave companies all had big networks, but they lacked [optionality](https://www.thegoodinvestors.sg/the-power-of-optionality-and-the-companies-that-wield-it/).>Optionality can come in the form of having opportunities to easily open up new business ventures. Think Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN).A lot of the value of AMZN, MSFT and APPL are essentially embedded call options on their new business ventures that can emerge.These companies like Uber, Zillow, etc have a very specific and niche focus compared to something like social networking or cloud computing. They are far less able to open up new lucrative business ventures than the other big tech companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 10:29:04'] Maybe you‚Äôre just looking at the wrong companies/have the wrong expectations for scale. Also, Meta is more next wave than the others in terms of age, they also just speed run to being a mega with much older companies.The last 10-15 year ipo tech stars:TSLA - 19,000%+FTNT - 3,900%+TTD - ~2,500%SHOP - 2,000%+NOW - 2,000%+PANW - 1,000%+META - ~600%TEAM - 500%+SQ - ~500%WDAY - 300%Of the last ~ 5 years DDOG, NET, ZS look to be front running as standouts, but it‚Äôs really early to know who has staying power and will continue to compound scale with such recent to market companies. Any of the IPOs from the last couple year boom will also have to fight bubble valuations at IPO for returns, which will weigh against them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:17:12'] They‚Äôre not profitable and don‚Äôt have a product. All the blue chips have an actual product to monetize.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:33:24'] I would consider META and NFLX more in common with Z and UBER than AAPL and MSFT.  META ipo was in 2012, which is around the same time as Zillow.  On the other hand, MSFT and AAPL ipo in 1980s.FAANG are just the most successful tech stocks in history.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:28:12'] The reason is very simple in my point of view: the "next wave" hasn't done enough to disrupt the incumbents. A few decades ago the top tech stocks were Intel, IBM, and Eastman Kodak. They're a shell of their former selves because they all got disrupted.Nobody has done enough for FAANG to be disrupted. For that to happen you need Facebook & Instagram to turn into MySpace (Meta), people stop using their phones for something else (AAPL), make it easier for businesses to do their computing needs than the cloud (Amazon), people stream TV somewhere else (Netflix), and start using ChatGPT as their new search engine (Google). None of that is easy and why the new wave hasn't disrupted them yet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:21:38'] Uber hasn't exactly flopped.  But it's not really tech or high tech like the FAANGs, it's a service company with an app.&#x200B;Now they have some interesting tech, and some good engineers, and have done a few interesting opensource projects. But at the end of the day their business is a service app.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:28:31'] The business models of the later companies were not really tech, but involved real-world activities that had significant barriers to entry and high transactional costs.    If you're running a taxi service or selling real estate, you have a lot of expenses that don't exist for the companies who just serve pages and videos that customers consume.   Look at something like Carvana.    I would say that their business model borders on the ridiculous.   A transaction like buying a car involves a lot of complicated friction points even at the transactional level - sales, financing, titling, registration, delivery, after-sales service, etc.   The idea that some tech company could step in and "disrupt" the market was absurd.    Experienced car dealers have seen it all, and know how to deal with the complex issues that can come up, but a tech start-up?     No way will they ever be successful.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:29:26'] A lot of those stocks were overbought during the Fed's wave of quantitative easing during the pandemic and might be victims of everything from slowing real estate (mortgage rates) to a reduction of ad spending (Yelp) as well as the cost of debt because of rate hikes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 18:09:20'] Firstly, I think despite the fancy FAANG acronym and tech label, each of those companies succeeded for different reasons. Facebook and Google are the most similar in that they offer online advertising that's essentially infinitely scalable and so they made money that way. Apple made money essentially through their brand power to sell products at a premium, so they make money though that premiumNetflix offers online streaming and that's also extremely scalable at very little marginal cost per user but very high marginal profitAmazon makes money through aws, not their retail business, and I think there was a recent Munger interview about Alibaba that summarises the situation well. He said something to the effect of despite all the hype, he forgot that at the end of the day, it's still retail which has terrible margins.I think that's the main issue with businesses like uber, you can slap the tech label on it but In the end the base business (a taxi/delivery service) is not an infinitely scalable high margin business
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 18:20:30'] Once daddy Powell started jacking up rates, cheap VC/investor money dried up and these "next gen" tech companies that were burning cash like it was going out of style now had to actually had to show some kind of profits.That's why you saw a sharp increase in fees at Uber, Lyft, doordash, etc
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:32:53'] Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft have done really well capitalizing on next wave of technology leaving very little room for others. But you are forgetting Nvidia, I feel most missed that train. People also been very negative on Tesla to their own detriment. Tesla and Nvidia actually had the best performance for a given time frame about last 10 years that any other technology company, I think ever. Google, Meta IPOd way to high for average investors to make real outsized returns. Amazon and Apple took much longer than 10 years. I do think Tesla right now has the best chance out all the giant technology companies to still 5x, maybe more. It‚Äôs hard for Apple todo that or Amazon or Microsoft. You are also forgetting crypto, crypto was and is a technology revolution just not run by companies and just like during dotcom most will not survive, but it does not change the fact that some will be wildly successful just like during and after dotcom. AI will fortunately or unfortunately be much more evenly disturbed at least across companies that use it properly, FAANG, Tesla, Nvidia will again benefit greatly, but probably not enough for a 10 bagger that I know many people are looking for here, accept maybe for Tesla. Crypto is probably the best choice for 10 bagger or more particularly from current lows, but with bigger risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:34:31'] In tech, actual and potential user base matters. FAANG's user base is pretty much EVERYONE in the whole world. Everyone uses a Facebook product of some sort, "check Amazon" and "Google it" can probably be added to the dictionary by now. Almost half of the world uses an Apple phone. Netflix pioneered/led the digital entertainment wave but they're definitely the weakest of the bunch now that many studios are taking their content back and launched their own streams.Most people only reach for the Uber app when they travel.Zillow, heard of the name around stock subs but I actually have know clue what they are. Most people probably don't even know what Zillow is.Yelp, easily replaced by Google reviews since Google is typically the starting point for users searching for businesses to begin with.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 12:09:10'] The difference is that, the companies you named own only an business plan. E.g  uber owns 0 cars, airbnb owns 0 hotels, etc.. While the faang group owns A Lot of things

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 10:12:15'] I know that Uber didn't really take off here in the Netherlands. It might be available in a few big cities or near the airport. Taxi's in general aren't a very viable business here because it's just not worth your money. So the average person rarely uses them. Any cost related to cars is already hugely inflated due to high taxes on gas and cars. Than the person has to get a lisence and training, plus be paid atleast minimum wage. I tried a taxi a couple of times. It felt like i barely got any value for a boatload of money. Twenty euros each way for 4 kilometres... fuck that i will ride my e-bike instead.So yeah the margins are already trash without the middle man.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:27:01'] These companies are very profitable yet. To be fair, even though it‚Äôs been a decade some of the mega cap tech stocks I think you‚Äôre referring to have been around for much, much longer‚Ä¶I personally also believe that part of this is due to these newer companies all surviving off of selling SaaS (software as a service) as their only revenue stream, as opposed to the other big tech companies selling multiple physical products (and now often multiple SaaS as well). It‚Äôs hard to explain and it‚Äôs kind of anecdotal from my observations but these newer companies that only have a single revenue stream from a SaaS simply haven‚Äôt figured out how to be very profitable yet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:46:00']    Yelp is somewhat useless, and personally, we don‚Äôt use Lyft or Uber.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:58:30'] It comes down to business model. Zillow and Yelp are digital advertising businesses that generally have small businesses or sole proprietors as customers (real estate agents and cafe owners, basically). Compared to FB, Google, etc, who sell advertising to Fortune 500 all the way down to those same small businesses, these newer companies have to work harder to acquire a less savvy customer with vastly smaller advertising budget (if any).Uber‚Äôs issues are different. Basically, their unit economics are inherently garbage and they‚Äôve even admitted that it might always be that way unless they can crack the code on autonomous taxis. They burned billions of dollars on that and seem to have retreated, so it‚Äôs hard to imagine the circumstances in which their business model starts to look better‚Ä¶
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 14:16:23'] Sometimes it comes down to timing and the public not being ready to adapt. I specifically think realtors will be non existent one day especially when their making 2.5% per side, but I don‚Äôt think the market is ready to drop them for 7-10 years. There are many instances where a product came out but didn‚Äôt get traction from the public because it‚Äôs too early.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 15:01:19'] My guess is because they don't make any advancements in fundamental software. All the big tech players of the previous wave actually solve quite general and fundamental engineering problems. Whether it's advanced statistics (i.e., what they tell you is AI), or something less sexy like scaling issues, the previous wave are the ones who actually solve these problems. The new wave just repackages solution for their specific niche. Investors have simply done a good job at pricing in a lack of innovation by the companies you list.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 15:25:41'] Tech has traditionally been about creating innovative products. Apple created the most important product of the human race, which is the iPhone.The past decade saw a different innovation, which is mainly compromised of platforms and software. Why? They figured it would be better to use the iPhone (and smartphones) to reach users.Uber disrupted taxis and eventually the food industry with Uber Eats. Customers ride in decent vehicles and get food/supplies at home. Merchants supply food or items without physical customers. Drivers create their own schedule and work as much (or as little) as they want. Covid brought the economy to its knees and Uber played a significant role in minimizing the blow. They employed drivers, while merchants stayed in business and users were able to get food and supplies without exposing to Covid. Those are powerful intangibles. While the business model may not be profitable yet, they unlocked untapped value through smartphones. As they disrupt other industries, like fleet and logistics, more value will be unlocked. They‚Äôll eventually become more profitable as margins improve and other industries are explored. Not to mention other tech advancements that will bring other sorts of possibilities.Uber is far from being a failure.

At the end of the day it‚Äôs still the driver and the rider. They didn‚Äôt really reduce the cost of the transaction.What does Zillow provide? I‚Äôm a home owner and I use it to look at houses, but I still got a real estate agent when buying a home. field is pretty well regulated. As for Zillow buying up homes, I‚Äôm not sure if that is anything special. Google and Facebook (and co) on the hand changed the way we work and play.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 19:26:42'] The most recent hyper-growth companies had a huge first mover advantage online. We forget that they had competitors too, but they won and they took all the ultra-low hanging fruit that the internet could enable. The original computer software wave of the 80s played out similarly. So when the lets call it, the second wave of the internet era came through in the 2010s there just wasn't as much opportunity.Now the next group of companies that may have hyper growth like Google or Amazon will likely be those establishing themselves early in the next generation of tech like AI and AR/VR. OpenAI for instance is only like 7 years old be seems like it may be poised to be a company that we are talking about decades from now.This all just conjecture but from a broad macro perspective I think explains a lot. Just too late to the party.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 20:58:44'] Uber was too early. Their catch item was not ‚Äúcrowd sourced ride share‚Äù. Their real move was to consolidate a user base and app presence in anticipation of self driving cars. There will come a time when your Uber shows up without a driver. The day that happens, the companies with the user base will likely make a lot of money. Until then‚Ä¶ yeah. So just too long before self driving cars. Zillow tried to make a killing on cornering the real estate market. A number of things worked against them. Their data was not as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù as they thought. The real estate market is huge and big banks have a lot of visibility, the transactions are mostly public. No one needed Zillow to be anything other than what it was and their data did not provide them sufficient advantage against the big banks they were really competing against. They also had the inability to hedge against downward moves in the real estate market, and their competitors could.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 03:24:36'] There are various reasons, but the primary one is that the original FAANG technology was game changing and was hard to imitate or copy.   The Uber's, Zillow, Yelp of the world had good tech, but they aren't hard to imitate or copy and they had physical entities that they have to deal with or depend upon. FAANG companies were the original disruptors and they entered the market at the right time when the physical entities they were supposed to be competing were bad and the FAANGs killed them for good.  Uber, Zillow were competing with the existing products which were doing relatively good.   Uber's original idea was game changer, but their expansion outside of US didn't go well due to various local reasons and the premise of their valuations fell apart when their expansion outside of US didn't pan as expected.  Zillow was limited to US market and they were never going to take the realtor's place.

They don't only have the most popular web site there ever has been in history by a lot.But then Google has the second most popular web site in history.    That is almost unfair.Then Google has 16 different services that have over a billion active users.   That is just insane.It does not leave much for the newer companies.   Take OTT in the US.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 12:45:17'] Imho and maybe I‚Äôm semantics focused but these aren‚Äôt really ‚Äútech‚Äù companies as much as service companies.  They utilize tech, because all companies have to in order to reach their market.  But they‚Äôre selling a non tech or low tech service utilizing tech to do so (ie your ride share app).  Side note:  for them to become wildly profitable the price of the service (for delivery and ride share services at least) would have to go up to a point where many customers would be priced out and/or turned off.True tech would be AAPL or MSFT, ie a company producing software or hardware for purposes of hosting other outside entities, ie the iPhone hosting all of your apps from a variety of other companies or azure hosting services for others in the cloud.

It is now cheaper to take a cab, although the Ubers are usually nicer than the cabs, and ordering an Uber is easier than getting a cab. Since I quit drinking, the only time I use Uber is when I travel out of town, like when I went to Chicago in February. We took 5 rides that weekend. Really no other reason for me to use it. I went from using it couple times a month, to a few times a year. As to the cost, my special needs adult son had a job that was less than 4 miles from our house. Earlier this year, I got him an uber to come home on a Thursday at 8 pm, and it was $38 dollars, more than he made working that day. A few years ago, I took an Uber over 40 miles to Nashville for less than $50 at 5 pm on a Thursday.

The current line up of tech companies are just gimmicks that on the contrary have technology that is quite old at this point.  Since these old blue chip tech stocks haven't brought anything new to the table they are no different at this point then a common crypto shit coin, essentially they are just stores of value, favorites of investors maybe, but nothing more.  To be fair the value is backed by profits, but the growth forecasts are all unrealistic and they will all fail or be replaced by foreign competitors before they will grow enough to pay back current lofty share prices which in some of these companies cases mean they would need to make profits for 60 years straight just to justify current share prices. (they are quite lofty and the world would in no universe grow that fast) The world isn't growing fast enough for their growth to justify their prices and it's that simple, and the next decade will likely be a continuation of highly competitive asset classes that will pull money from these companies market caps as higher interest rates become impossible to be put back into the box.  That's the thesis and I'm sticking to it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 15:06:05'] TSLA has cut prices, what? 6 times this year? They have cut the price of the Model Y by 20% in 4 months. I saw the news about their latest cuts this morning and was going to buy some puts, but the price of the puts were up about 60% since yesterday. I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs only down 4.5% so far. I expected at least 7-8%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:11:38'] I must admit I am somewhat surprised that Tesla has had to cut prices so much and get reduced margins already.  I thought they had a couple more years of being able to run wild before really having to adjust so much to face stiffer competition.  If that's the case already, then you have to wonder how things will look when more of the big boys really start to ramp up production.Anyway I likely never will own any Tesla equity directly (only through index funds) because their share price is never rational.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 14:15:27'] I think it's important to put this in the context of other car companies.Ford, for instance, is selling every EV they make for a loss.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 17:13:16'] It‚Äôs a premium auto manufacturer. They sell cars marketed towards the crowds of high income, loves to be on the cusp of lifestyle tech. The gigantic layoffs from big tech the past 6 months of course were going to hit in their biggest demographic.Tesla is a car conpany. Electric propulsion, Ai powered cruise controls are cool features they have a narrow lead on, not any exclusivity. Legacy auto will be more than ready to keep its market share when the electric car buying really ramps up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:29:22'] Overreact and sell if you want to. I'll be buying at the lower prices. In a few years time Telsa will be still be increasing production, cutting costs, and announcing new factories. The competition will be fighting to sell a significant number at profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 13:35:24'] unit growth and topline is still good considering amount of price cuts seen. but huge drop in GM/OM. Big question is CT launch. Its April and they are just saying later this year. Dont think CT will have any impact on top line this year. Plus with no M2 for another 2 years(if we have to wait for Mexico GF to go online) at minimum, I think growth will stall unless they decrease price even more which is hard to see with the margins seen.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 07:30:25'] Assuming Tesla grows EPS 15% q/q from Q421-Q322, which I think is very conservative (Q421 should land around $2.5) their current forward P/E at the time of me posting this is around 74. Still very expensive relative to its tech peers, but also growing faster than any of them objectively. Could be another bargain if Tesla delivers on its promise of "50% growth for years to come" or could be a disaster if they are unable to scale due to sanctions/china relations, continued chip shortage leading to lower growth than promised, Elon retiring which would all undoubtedly crash the stock back to "normal" valuations. I bought in at 900 on December 20th and am only adding from here.   2020 taught me a valuable lesson to follow the fundamentals instead of following short term macroeconomics. I sold everything that March and bought everything back at higher prices later. I think Tesla continues to dominate scale and efficiency over the foreseeable future while expanding margins HEAVILY. Even if level 5 autonomy never work out, 15% of Tesla owners will absolutely pay $200/month for level 4 autonomy. How soon that comes is TBD, but having followed it very closely since Beta released, the software improvements are translating to better real world results at what should be an alarming pace to other FSD competitors. The second it comes to wide release for $200/month, its immediate and substantial impact to EPS will be felt in a sharp move upward imo.  TLDR - Tesla is printing money while expanding revenues faster than any of its tech peers. If you don't like volatility don't get in on it, but if you want to long it, do it now and don't think twice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 23:21:27'] This sub hates Tesla. Don't expect anything but negative comments towards TSLA. I'm all in TSLA + 25% margin. I used more margin to buy 10 shares today.  If I told you there was a company who sold 1 million "things" for an average price of 50k with 30% margins and growing 50% a year. That's an amazing business. Tesla operating income is fixed. As they build more factories - each additional car they sell will grow their margins even more. With FSD + new factories, I can see TSLA hitting 35%+ margins (iphones are like 40% margins) by 2024. Theres no doubt that TSLA will be the most valuable company. Apple doesn't even manufacturer their own phones. People will always be critical of what they dont understand. Here's a CNBC clip from today https://youtu.be/6GCJ0CHY268
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 01:48:29'] $300. At this point I am not touching Tesla until it gets back to a reasonable p/e. There are plenty of other stocks to buy and I don't need to gamble with a heavily overpriced stock. If I want a growth, tech, or disruptive stock there are plenty others down 50% and more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 05:24:43'] I couldn't care less what the price is. I won't touch Tesla until Elon Musk is no longer the CEO. I just personally don't care for the guy, nor do I care for his cult following - which will downvote this comment into oblivion in 3... 2... 1...
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 05:14:27'] Fuck me, what a collection of stock pickers we have in this community. See you in a few years when tsla trades above 2000 at a PE of 50. Each of the people citing PE in this thread forget tsla started 2021 at a PE of 1000
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 23:00:21'] Anything under $500 is a sure bet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 21:33:42']  A buy number for me would be around 380$. I think their market is gonna be a whole lot bloodier than people are projecting going forward, and until their other sources of revenue (software/energy) actually start producing there is just a ton of risk. Given that, I need a big risk margin to get in, and it‚Äôs just not there. This isn‚Äôt to say you won‚Äôt make money on Tesla, it‚Äôs just priced like it completely lacks any real risk, which I really disagree with.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 23:33:14'] Nothing. At a a 200 billion market cap, Tesla would still be worth more than VW and Ford combined. Which basically tells you what their realistic market cap would be if they actually are able to dominate such markets. Even if they are able to dominate in their other markets, its realistic market cap would still be in the hundred of millions. Meaning that the bubble would need to pop before they go anywhere.And if the bubble pops, Tesla becomes just another company, as the religious Tesla fanatics would leave.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 05:40:33'] Here's the issue. Their earnings do not justify their stock price. Period. If the fan brand effect were to disappear Tesla stock would be worth significantly less. Been a while since I did my analysis but I would have to compare them to their nearest direct competitors, ie Ford, Toyota, etc. Start there for value.What's their earnings per share vs stock price add in value for anticipated growth in market share for TSLA vs their competitors, ie. New products coming out, performance of exiting products vs competitors,  And subtract any supply issues anticipated that might stymie growth or market factors that they have no control over. Ie changing government regulations that remove some of their ability to sell fuel credits to competitors. Then arrive at the approximate market vale of a stock for said company. It's probably similar to Toyotas value but possibly slightly higher due to anticipation if them stealing future market share. But since they don't have a truck or a cargo van and there's no reason to expect they will anytime soon. It places TSLA at an extreme disadvantage currently in the vehicle marketplace. Want me to like them better, com out with a cargo van to replace the Mercedes sprinter for Amazon's fleet. Come out with a pragmatic pickup truck. Come out with a semi. TSLA has big dreams but moves so slowly at achieving them that all of their competitors are bringing electric vehicles to market faster than TSLA can just produce the couple cars they currently make. By the time they do come out with a semi Mercedes will own the electric semi space making competition more difficult. They'll have to fight for market share. The cybertruck is DOA. TSLA doesn't seem to understand the truck marketplace. Or the need for modular customizability of truck beds to fit multiple purposes or the need for various engine sizes. Yes they have multiple motors but they're the wrong sizes. They need direct competitors with ford f150, f250,f350,f450,etc. But what they have is a hermaphrodite 150/250. Completely ignoring the workplace setting for these trucks by preventing the truck bed from being removed so that trailers can be hauled or work toolbox or flatbeds can be used. TSLA thinks they're a consumer product. That wrong idea is making them waste time producing a consumer product. Trucks are b2b products that many people also use as personal vehicles for economic reasons. If they're not modular tsla will give away truck marketshare to everyone else because tslas leader has never used a truck to work he didn't really "get" why they were used or what they're used for. Ford lives or dies by the F150. TSLA could have given them a run for their money. But TSLAs vision is flawed. It's wrong. I anticipate a complete failure for the cybertruck. He's a decade away from being a competitive vehicle company with a product in each category. Longer still for the truck category because Elon musk doesn't seem to understand the consumer base. I would subtract estimated future value from TSLA because of how much nonsense the cybertruck design showed. Elon musk needs to stop trying to make something flashy and instead make something thats so pragmatic the world asks why we haven't done it this way yet. Rivian gets it way more. Their modular skateboard design is a masterclass in efficiency of manufacturing. Where's this genius at in TSLA? It's all being used to make flashy TED talks. Rivian has their own problems and areoiced too high for it to become a mainstream product. But they clearly understand the truck consumer better than TSLA. TSLA didn't even seem to ask what people want from a truck. They just recreated the Dilorean and put i a lift kit. When why they needed was stock tool beds or flat bed configurations. Motor assemblies / chassis that made them direct competitors with the f150s, 259s, 350s, etc. Is he doing well so far? Yeah, does TSLA deserve to be the world's exponentially most expensive car stock?  Fuck no. Ten years from now if their stock price isn't aooixmiately equal to Toyotas I still will think it's overvalued. $197.00 per share is Toyotas current stock price. Let's start with TSLA at around this. Now attribute the approximate percentage of that that they earn from sedans and minivans. This is tslas approximate value starting point. When they grow into a full sized vehicle not car company a vehicle company. Will reassess.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 21:26:42'] To be honest we are late to the Ball game to get Tesla shares imo so I keep playing options and I will play them until Elon musk sells off the vehicle portion of Tesla and it crumbles. But until then why consider shares since they are so expensive? 100 shares will cost you $100,000 well right now it'll cost you $90,000 but just for ease of math, the amount of leverage you could have for a hundred grand is immense and since Tesla doesn't have any dividends there really is no upside to holding shares at 1000 bucks, if you had gotten in at 400 originally or even better than yes hold your shares and be happy but at this point I just keep playing options and I'm making a lot of money since Tessa goes up and down 50 points each day.

They've needed to replace the S for a few years now and their quality is still abysmal.Now that the rest of the market is coming around to EVs and new players that learned from Tesla's mistakes (Lucid and Rivian), I won't be buying Tesla anytime in the future.Plus, Tesla is a bit of a Ponzi scheme.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 23:03:12'] tesla is worth the exact "current price of the stock"/factor of ten, it always has been that way.so if trading 1000.00 currently, then in reality it is only worth or should be100 bucks. always has been over inflated by a factor of 10.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 21:32:06'] I sold at ~$450 - so that's my answer.  Every auto company in the world is now switching to EV.  TSLA is not only losing competitive advantage - the tides will turn as they start to become ubiquitous (which is already happening). The desire to own a mass produced anything fades as it becomes the norm.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 00:47:46'] Tesla is way undervalued at the current price. Analysts always underestimated their earnings, but people who actually understand the company are expecting an EPS between 2.5 and 3. Annualized that's a PE between 91 and 76 and they'll continue to grow earnings, so their forward PE is even lower than that. With the two new factories opening up, the forward PE could be as low as 35-45. For a company that just grew revenue by 70% and net income by 726%...  That is not sustainable.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 22:07:13'] I bought before the Split at $230. I think you may be a bit late. In my opinion, the company still has a lot to offer so I would say start now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 01:41:03'] Your question doesn't speak of situations and that's a problem, so I guess I'll assume you're talking price with the current climate of Tesla's operations.If Tesla keeps delivering as they have been, and with new factories set to come online, I'd be buying anything around the 500 mark. They are doing too many great things with robotics and manufacturing, taking risks that seem to be paying off so far, and really could be a very different company in 5 years. The same is hard to imagine with general car companies.Tesla have so far been the only ones to take huge risks, evolve in a significant way regarding manufacturing, solve problems on the fly (such as making their own chips during a shortage). For me, I think the quality to take risks and to reward workers for being highly creative and inventive is something refreshing to see in what is basically a tech company at this point. Technology requires those qualities, but big companies like status quo and careful moves. High risk, high reward situation obviously.In short, 500 and below unless something very positive happens to warrant a higher valuation. Not at all if the wheels start falling off.

(And if it does I'd probably be worried and not buy it.)
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-25 06:39:32'] Putting aside all the hype and cult like faith in Musk, the actual company now is growing between 15-30% a year. So let's say optimistically it is 25%.  That means that even with a slight premium it deserves to be cut by 65%.  So the entry point would be under $400.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-24 21:25:05'] Good luck because Musk sold off a good percentage last year and he may buy it back before it goes too low! He sold at what price? So what price do you think he will buy it back k for? This is the question...when will the rich jump back in

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:51:49'] I‚Äôve been tracking ATZ.TO for a while now. My only concern is recession taking a hit on their sales as the average item they sell in price is comparable to LULU (maybe even more if you include their outerwear). Still the brand seems to be wildly popular so if it dips then it‚Äôs def a buy. Same thing with Sonos (not the ticker you mentioned) but IMO had an equally sticky customer base who rave about the product and experience. Again not sure if I want to own a higher end brand in a recession especially if FEDs want to increase unemployment.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:48:51'] Good luck. I love how the vast majority of these posts don‚Äôt even begin to pay lip service to any sort of valuation model.

POST_TEXT: b"You can't justify calculating TSLA's future value from the current numbers. You have to be expecting growth in sectors and markets not yet accessed by the company. That is eminently possible but with no information there is no reasonable way to estimate it. Your error bars are too large to create a valid result.\n\nYou also have to hope that the expected competition coming to the company's current sectors won't cause existing growth to slow. And that's not going to happen. Every car maker on Earth is coming for the EV market, because manufacturing most kinds of ICE cars is going to be banned in the future, and they want to remain in business, and will not find it hard to do so.\n\nBottom line: if Tesla doesn't start to access new business lines (robotics is a good example) it will start to get its ass kicked in EV, and it will collapse and be remembered as a fad.\n\nThat's all the certainty there is.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 11:27:27'] Things people seem to neglect when talking about Tesla:1. They are aggressively good at manufacturing, they produce cars 5x faster on the same production space.2. They've managed to bring down great margins on EVs whilst other companies are barely break even.3. Making ICE cars is not the same as making EVs.4. Tesla is 3 years ahead, noone else is producing significant volume until atleast 2025.5. The car market has never been part of a govt subsidised energy transition, this market is not the same.I'm pretty certain is going the way of Apple, they are building an ecosystem and I'm fairly certain pretty soon they'll be selling a "lifestyle".I don't own Tesla I prefer Toyota but the two are like old school Apple VS Microsoft.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 16:28:20'] How can you be so sure that they will get their ass kicked in the electric vehicle market? Sure it‚Äôs a possibility, but you proclaim it as near certainty.If you look at other technological revolutions, incumbents often have trouble to catch the next wave (there is a great book called the innovators dilemma which discusses why this occurs). Here are a few prominent examples:1. IBM failing to conquer the PC market2. Yahoo/Jeezes/etc failing to overtake Google in search3. Every big box retailer failing to compete with Amazon in retail4. Google going into social networking5. Nokia/Blackberry/etc failing to overtake Apple in smartphones6. Kodak failing in digital photography
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 10:54:53'] Tesla is a growth company so of course when you look at the PE and compare it to GM and F it will look expensive.Tesla is currently trading at a 12-month forward P/E of 80. In 2021, Tesla increased its profits by 700%. In 2022 they will be growing their profits by ~100% and by over 50% for the forceable future (without Robotaxis and Robots).Peter Lynch, who I am sure you are familiar with, used the PEG to identify if a company was undervalued. Any stock with a PEG (PE/G) less than 1 is undervalued in his mind. Things have changed a fair bit since then as we are in a low interest rate environment. The S&P 500 PEG was around 2 last I checked. Companies like Apple were above that. If you were to calculate Tesla PEG (80/100) it is <1. Again, without any of the Robotaxis and Robot value built in.So when you invest in Tesla at these prices you are getting a company that is undervalued in relation to the S&P500 and other tech giants and you get a free call option on Robotaxis and Robots if they occur in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 14:48:06'] I have no idea what the future holds for Tesla. But they are the #6 market cap company without the current revenue/income of the other top companies. Seems to me that they are much more likely to go down by 75% than go up another 2-3x

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 22:27:17'] Oh no, another competition is coming to kill Tesla. How many times have we heard that in the last 10 years? Let's look at the numbers. Tesla sold over 900,000 Model 3 and Model Y in 2021. They will probably make 1,600,000 Model 3 and Y this year. Here is how the competition did in 2021:US EV leader GM sold 26.00.000 EV in Q4. Bolt is discontinued. Ford sold 27k Mach E in US despite its released around the same time as Model Y. Worldwide, Ford produced 60,000 Mach E (Ford doesn't breakdown how many are sold, which is quite suspicious).Oh how about Europe? I heard VW is the absolute leader. Well, worldwide, VW sold 200,000 ID 3 and ID4 in 2021. It's a respectable number but nowhere close to what Tesla did. For the whole VW group, they sold around 400,000 EV. Again, pretty good. But not close. How about the Chinese? Isn't Tesla being destroyed by China's big 3? No. Tesla sold over 450,000 cars in China in 2021. Nio, Li Auto and Xpeng sold less than 100k each. Tesla outsold China's big three combined. The competition is coming. They did come. But it doesn't make a difference.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 23:50:17'] Other companies are selling their self driving features as part of the price of the vehicle,  nobody is going to be buying it from tesla for $50k or $100k whatever the hell Elon said its going to be.  Nobody is buying their batteries or motors either,  they don't make much of anything from their solar but hey "it's not just a car company." I know a few people who just bought new bmws (idiots) and lexus vehicles,  they told me they were leaning towards EV but don't want to wait 3 months for a service appointment when there's something wrong with the vehicle but would have bought from one of the major auto makers who have dealerships and service centers in every major city.

They'll also be far along becoming an energy company with Tesla Solar. What many fail to realize... Is Tesla has nothing to unwind. No legacy ICE business. They have a huge head start in battery tech, manufacturing efficiency and have yet to spend hardly any $ on advertising. Tesla also has locked up futures contracts for the important raw materials in EVs. Lithium, nickel, cobalt, etc. They will be a free cash flow machine for the next few years. Self funding new gigafactories all over the globe. People have bet against Musk for decades now. They've all lost.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 07:41:16'] This is the correct take. The share price is not based on any financial metrics (it would be completely overvalued if so), it is based on potential and innovation. It is based on growth beyond what we measure traditional growth companies for. It is based on an X factor that truly does not exist for other companies and cannot be put into a spreadsheet.Personally I stay away from Tesla as I like being able to justify a price, but I totally *get* the bull argument for Tesla. It's exciting to watch. Of the entire stock market, Tesla is legitimately the only company that can make a "to the moon!" claim.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 20:13:59'] This post was refreshing. It's nice to see someone take a deeper dive with Tesla, because all I keep hearing is talk of how high the P/E is. Well, the P/E keeps shrinking drastically and the metric is the equivalent of a 1st date when going through the process of valuing a company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 11:27:50'] Based off of your thesis; what‚Äôs the logic in stating it‚Äôs likely Tesla will become a fad and not just a new member of the top selling car companies like Ford and Toyota just with a much better debt schedule and top notch margins & supply chain?

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 20:46:46'] I disagree entirely. They will not get their ass kicked in EVs until competition can match their margins. That may never happen, ever. Part of the secret to their margins is their culture of non-stop innovation, another is their engineering talent. They had to invent a new alloy to make the giga-press work. Competition does not have this manufacturing advantage. They don't have in house 4680 battery cells or structural battery pack. They are so far behind right now and they don't have the engineers to catch up. They can MAYBE start to catch up in sales as a group, but margin? No way. They will go bankrupt trying to develop the manufacturing they need to match the profit levels of Tesla. This I know.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 13:18:30'] What is everyone so sensitive about Tesla and proving it to be some neo-behemoth of a company? It jumped from a market price of $50 to $1200 more or less overnight, that is not common. It seems everyone wants to treat the company as the only innovator of batteries, solar, cars, etc, etc, etc. THERE IS COMPETITION, and there will be more. Elon is a bright guy but up to 2 years ago there was real questions about the company being able to ever make money. I‚Äôm not saying they are going out of business but there is a ton of companies that can easily compete with them. They are not Amazon or Google that has been able to stifle competition.

It's an emerging company and will naturally have higher growth rates than more mature manufacturers. There will come a point where their supply meets demand. This is where their products in other sectors will start to matter. If they can use the profits from the vehicle division and funnel it into other sectors they will be fine.Also they have a huge cult following that will just buy and hold the stock, which fucked over shorts in the past. It's never a good idea to bet against a cult.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 19:51:10'] You can from just car sales, just do the math. EV sales is still a small % of total sales. Car makers are still slow and running into problems, going EV kills off their current profitable buisness noone wants to do that.

People always say that more EVs from others means less EVs will be sold by Tesla. That's simply not true. Legacy OEMs introducing EVs is not eating into Tesla's sales, it's eating into Legacy ICE sales. EV adoption globally has gone from 1%, to 2%, to 4%, to 6%, and now will be over 10% in 2022 in just a few years.Tesla has ALWAYS openly welcomed anyone and everyone to make EVs. It's just that nobody else can make EVs at 30% gross margins. Otherwise nobody would be making ICE cars.Legacy OEM's 80% of the profitability comes from SERVICING the vehicle, not MANUFACTURING the vehicle.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 05:34:08'] First of all, I‚Äôd like to point out there‚Äôs only one Wall Street analyst with a price target as low as yours, and they all do much more extensive modeling and plenty of them are bearish and/or dislike Tesla and the hype surrounding it. Now, let‚Äôs get specific. Your problem is that you assumed that Tesla would grow revenue 26% per year and profit 29% per year (much lower than what they are guiding for, but ok) through 2030 and still get a P/E of 15? That‚Äôs ridiculously low for that level of growth. AMZN P/E is around 74 ($3,100 divided by $41.91 EPS excluding one time Rivian stock gain) for lower levels of growth. And before you pull the ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs an automotive company‚Äù bullshit, think for a second. Tesla already has the highest net income margin in the automotive business and still expanding, has virtually no debt, and has been able to grow faster than any other automotive company. Nothing about Tesla‚Äôs business fundamentals says it‚Äôs a traditional auto, and it should not be valued as such. You will never see Tesla at 15 P/E this decade.Your other problem is assuming flat net income margin through 2030. Tesla has shown incredible and consistent operating leverage (meaning operating expenses grow more slowly than revenue/gross profit) hence their constant margin expansion over the last couple years. This is probably your most bearish assumption. Overall, your assumptions are just very, very bearish relative to the current reality right now.By the way, your $287 price target represents a trailing 12 month P/E of only 59, and a forward P/E of <24. It‚Äôs stupid low for a company that will grow revenue >50% this year and earnings by ~150%.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 05:38:59'] You're totally right. You should definitely short Tesla and see how it turns out. Put your money on the line and post your trade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 04:47:29'] Interesting analysis, but there are a lot of logical fallacies clouding the conclusion. Just to name a few:* You pretended like a PE of 15 would rich for Tesla's automotive department because its peers are averaging around a PE of 10, but all these other automotive companies have much lower margins and significant bankruptcy risks, and they haven't shown a capability to produce EVs profitably yet. A PE of 15 for a company with Tesla's margins is quite low.* You're using margins comparable to today for 2030, despite Tesla heavily investing in new factories without utilizing their economies of scale yet. I believe 13% is an extreme bear case for Tesla's margins in 2030, not a bull case.* You're forecasting the automotive market based on numbers during a pandemic and loads of supply chain issues. It's not reasonable to expect a 25% drop in annual sales just because the last two years have been troubled by lockdowns, logistical and supply chain issues. Especially with EVs becoming cheaper than comparable ICE vehicles, it's much more realistic to forecast a slight increase in sales compared to pre-COVID, to around 90-100M a year.* You're forecasting Tesla's market share based on a time period where they are building two new factories that will each build more cars than their two current factories combined. You say their market share probably peaked, but it very easily could be going up again once Berlin and Texas open up, as these factories will bring Tesla's installed capacity to somewhere in the 5M a year range as they ramp up.* You're comparing ASP's of ICE cars with EVs. That makes no sense, as EVs have much lower cost of ownership and people are willing to pay a bit more today to save a lot in the future. Especially when taking into account car leasing where you don't pay that extra amount up front but do enjoy the lower recurring costs. Factoring in inflation, I think $50K ASPs may be a little on the low end.Taking just these five points, if we forecast the automotive market to increase to 100M, with Tesla having a 18% market share with ASP's of $55K, margins of 20% and a PE of 20 (remember you said you were talking about the bull case, not a base case), we're already at 100M * 0.18 * 55,000 * * 0.2 * 20 = $3,960,000,000,000 or roughly $4T or about $4,000 per share.So to say that $287 is a BULL target in 2030, even if you're just looking purely at the automotive business and ignoring everything else including their car software, is simply not realistic.

Right before Chapter 4 you compared Model S and X sales from 2018-2021, the reason that they were down was because of the refreshed interior shutting down the previous manufacturing line for months. Also, current Model 3/Y demand alone gets Tesla to 3 million units a year at current ASP.

But maybe the 2 of you are right, and EVs are and will forever be a niche market that Tesla will inevitably just have a sliver of...vs thinking the EV market will be the automobile market altogether.Anyway. Let me ask these basic questions:1. When (what year) will Tesla stop being resource constrained? 2. When do you believe that Tesla will stop boosting production?3. Do you believe that Tesla will fail to crack FSD? (Ever)4. Do you believe that insurance/financing is a unimportant part of the business?5.

It's the first time AI can navigate the real world which leads to 3 big things coming. Robotaxis to slowly replace all miles driven to profit Tesla. This likely starts this year or next. Software is pretty great right now. Humanoid AI robot - Tesla can already navigate the real world with a car, doing so with two legs will take only a little effort from here. Other robotics efforts have not had this before and ultimately are in perpetual model making mode. This slowly replaces all human labor. Then ai software as a service - this could start making more and more business decisions and slowly start running all companies.

I've been watching beta videos every update since the beginning. There has been clear and steady progress. Many people doing 90minute + drives without disengagements. They are still happening but FSD will be solved it's only a matter of time. Certainly before 2025. Once it is complete majority of cars they've already made will be able to use it. Some might require upgrade to chips but if the car has cameras it will be able to use it. That's a huge potential fleet. The problem with TeslaQ idiots like you is underestimating the impact of FSD and the NN. This AI awareness of its surroundings will be applicable for many different uses. This software will change the world dramatically.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-15 16:14:47'] Kind of funny that Tesla had more revenue then Cisco in 2021 and in 2022 Tesla will have more then double Cisco revenue and higher earnings.Tesla will do over 1.8 million deliveries in 2022.The lowest estimate for share price is $250, so you are almost more bearish then the biggest bear on Tesla. But when you believe nothing Tesla says they will do, I guess that sounds about right. I keep wondering what it will take until the Bears admit they were wrong, I keep thinking 1 more year, but I been saying it for 3 years now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-16 00:02:51'] Big waste of time writing that, my man. You are underestimating the degree to which a company like Tesla can, and likely will, change over the next 8+ years. We are in a new era. There is no more room in big business to rest on your laurels, and the companies who have done that for decades without improving margins, making significant technological improvements, or taking big risks are getting left in the dust.Tesla may not hit all the targets expected. But there will be new targets we can't foresee at the moment. A company like Tesla only comes around once in a while, where creativity and risk-taking is promoted. That is worth a hell of a lot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-19 15:22:24'] This is much better analysis than Tesla critics typically do, so well done at making things precise. As a gesture of recognition from the dark side, I want to point out two broad points that I think you're missing.One, you're not recognizing the category difference between a Tesla vehicle and other vehicles. This leads you to putting Tesla vehicles into buckets where they don't belong. People that would normally buy nothing more than a used Prius are paying $30k-$40k more for a Tesla, without hesitation. Tesla's cars are in a different category the way the iPhone was in a different category from feature phones. But making this precise is like trying to pin down the difference between the food at two different restaurants. There's no real proper language for doing such a thing. If it's not obvious to you from just visiting Tesla's website, then you should regard it as a blind spot that you have. This blind spot is by far the biggest reason short sellers have lost so much money in the company's history.And to be clear, this doesn't have anything to do with the EV component. A car such as the Mach e, which is a great first generation EV by Ford, is not in the same category as a Tesla. Ford's next generation products will be better, and eventually Tesla's competitors will make something in roughly the same category as a Tesla, but it may take until 2025 or beyond. The timeline to watch is how long it takes the industry's software systems to shift away from the decentralized, outsourced, difficult-to-coordinate model to one which is more centralized and vertically integrated, something which is currently completely unnatural to the industry. As someone with an understanding of software, you probably understand the advantage Tesla has as a company which develops their entire software stack, vs an industry which regards components as impenetrable black boxes. Consider the implications of this for over-the-air updates, for example. Of course there are pros and cons to these different approaches, but the pros go to Tesla at this stage in the game.Second, you're looking at Tesla in isolation and not taking into account large-scale issues that will affect the automotive industry as a whole. The current ICE industry sells cars at certain prices. These prices are based on a gigantic global machine called the auto industry. This machine requires certain volumes to function properly. If the ICE industry permanently loses say 20% or 30% of demand, this high-scale machine will have to down-shift to a lower scale, and it will do so catastrophically. The end result is higher prices. ICEs will become even more expensive than EVs, in a more rapid fashion than people expect. Automakers which have not leapt far enough into the EV world as the weight of their ICE assets drags them into the abyss will not survive. This is just one major problem facing competitors.Again, kudos for laying things down in writing. I think you're way ahead of the game just by doing that. Despite the supposed financial literacy of short sellers, in reality many of them have just jumped from one piece of confirmation bias to the next, so it's good to see someone bringing clarity to their thought process. Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-24 18:37:40'] While I'm bearish on TSLA, I think there is no harm in keeping a small portion of your portfolio as TSLA. Something like <5% could give you exposure for if it takes off, while limiting your exposure if it falls or stagnates. Portfolio balancing is usually a great way to control risk, and my personal preference is equal weighting.In case it matters, I'm bearish on TSLA because I think it's easy to win a game when you're the only one playing. The future market of electric vehicles appears to be crowded and my expectation is that they'll sort of equalize before too long.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 05:35:24'] Aside from what other comments mention a lot of the bullish models not only believe in the revenue growth story but they also expect improving margins. Margins for many are expected to stabilize at 30-35%+, but this quarter margins went down to 27.9%.     What this means is that now there is doubt about the capability of Tesla of increasing margins together with the increase of sales volume.

Has to be institutions buying for a reason, and I highly doubt it is because they believe TSLA is worth more than a trillion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:54:00'] Using trailing metrics for a growth company rather than forward looking metrics sound like a great way to miss outLikewise, comparing Tesla to other automakers has been, and continues to be a logical fallacy, seemingly brought about by either inability or willful refusal to look at that comparison at more than a surface glance before drawing conclusions.

TBH, I wouldn't be able to sleep if I had a few Tesla shares right now, and I would drive myself insane trying to determine whether to hold or sell.

Just saying that you cannot compare the metrics of a growth stock that is disrupting one (possible mutiple(!)) gigantic global markets at once with that of companies that have just been trying to get by on "same-old same-old" for decades.People have been asking me if they should buy since I bought in (2 years back) and I'm always "I dunno if it will go any higher - can't give you a definite recommendation...but I'm still thinking Tesla has some major potential (2-4x) within the next 10 years"

The CEO has often commented on Teslas stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. \n\nIn 2020, when Teslas stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was too high.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 08:46:24'] The key to this absurd valuation is the autonomous taxi stuff, which IMO is still a long way off.Just go drive around a medium to large city for a few hours on a Friday afternoon and tell me how this shit is going to work. I am not convinced the tech is anywhere near close to being able to seamlessly just drive around town taxing people from here to there.  Autonomous driving is a great goal and I'd love to see it work out - the amount of bad driving and traffic deaths, not to mention the insane rises in car insurance means something needs to be done. I just don't see how it is going to be feasible in a few years.  I think we are more like 15 years away from it than 5 years away .

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 09:32:11'] Tesla would be $3k a share when? $3k a share would make Tesla worth \~$3 trillion, making it more valuable than Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. More importantly, it would make Tesla WAY more valuable (in valuation) than all other automakers and solar panel company COMBINE, by far.So what does Elon offer to justify that valuation? Is he rolling Space X into the fold?

(Fords investment into batteries etc)Whenever Elon talks about stocks or crypto I stop listening, the man is clearly out to suit his own interests at the expense of others, he will lead you on sell you the dream and then take your money and leave you holding the bag.His investments into Bitcoin made him more than Tesla, the man knows the power of the pump and dump and clearly will not stop.The man is capitalism cancer personified, him and bezos can set sail into the sun and the world would be a much healthier place.TL:DR.Elon is bullshitting you to buy a stock he wants to manipulate (AGAIN)

Notwithstanding what Elon wants or thinks, competition is coming. Reinvestment is going to have to go up and prices across the EV market are to become more competitive. The TSLA is stupidly overvalued crowd seems to ignore that the company has solid and loyal costumer base, a reputable brand, and first mover advantage in the EV market. It certainly has a long way to go in terms of its potential market share. But remember, the car business is fierce, reinvestment is high, and unless you‚Äôre into luxury exclusive vehicles, your revenues are very pro-cyclical.

The share price is merely an approximation of the expected value of these outcomes at any given time.  Is Tesla's intrinsic value presently $700 Billion?  Probably not, but when assigning weights to the possibility of bankruptcy vs. dominant EV/robotaxi/AI superpower the present expected value is $700 Billion.  For simple math, that could include a 10% chance the company is worth $7 Trillion and 90% chance of bankruptcy in 5 years.

It's a premium brand and they have very poor PR and customer service while also delaying the releases of the electric semi's.Anyone looking at ARKK etf would be worried at the kinds of stocks they're holding such big % of; looking at you Unity, coinbase and zoom. If people really think tesla is going to 3 trillion then the bubble is going at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 17:09:57'] My 2 Cents as a Noob.I‚Äôve said this before, and I‚Äôll say it again: No offense, but it stumps me when, even Tesla owners, continue to compare a Tesla with other EVs. To me, it is like you are comparing Apples and stones (or was I supposed to say Oranges here?)Every Tesla Auto is an EV, but not every EV is a Tesla. Do cars have 4 wheels? Yes. Do cars have a way to run? Yes, they do. But that does not make any EV Manufacturer a competitor to Tesla. Tesla is a Computer on Wheels that is going to further blow any competition out of the water with FSD (doesn‚Äôt matter when it releases to the Public). Tesla has been, is, and will always be ahead of 99% of the Competition. IMHO. In my mind, Tesla is spelled like this ‚Äú**S**-**Y**-**N**-**E**-**R**-**G**-**Y**‚Äù.The Competition: (1) Is late in the race by at least a decade;(2) Is still focused on ICE Cars, for most part, since it is their bread and butter - they cannot just abandon suddenly, what they have been good at doing for close to 100 years (and is still earning them $$$$$$$) and run a race on a totally different track that would add to their Revenues several years/decades (?) down the line to match what they have been making for so long. Most of their resources are still focused on keeping these Revenue streams flowing - and while they continue to do this, Tesla will, as usual, continue to focus all it‚Äôs energies to moving forward in the EV-space.(3) Will be spending their time, effort and money trying to bring down Tesla or to slowing Tesla down - again a distraction from their goal to accomplish FSD.(4) will be aiming at where Tesla is right now, and by the time years roll by and the competition reaches Tesla‚Äôs capabilities, in terms of Range, driving technology etc., Tesla would already have moved further up in these and other new capabilities.(5) Will continue to sell through their Dealers-with lesser maintenance being required on EVs (compared to ICE), the middleman will try to make more money on each Sale, adding no value  as such, but, at the same time, adding and passing the additional cost to the Buyer. The last time we bought an ICE Car (tho it was also fun at some level, and a good learning experience for my son who was buying it), I hated having to spend 5 hours at the Dealership haggling the price down from $35,000 to $24,000 (which is  68% of the price that was first quoted - I‚Äôm really amazed that the ICE Dealerships have that kind of power and those kind of margins!) No wonder the Dealership Association have been up in arms against the Tesla sell-direct-to-Customer model. And this campaign by them has been supported full-heartedly by the ICE Companies and their Unions, since their individual and combined existence is in peril, and they would be willing do anything to stop Tesla‚Äôs continued progress.It is going to be a very steep uphill journey for the behemoths to overcome the inertia (or the lack thereof) to reach where Tesla is at, and also keep up with the innovation that Tesla has been, and will continue to drive, for it‚Äôs ‚ÄúFan Boys‚Äù and ‚ÄúFan Gals‚Äù - we are (almost?) a cult now üòâ. You will not be able to move the needle for me from my love for Tesla.My prediction: While all the other Auto Companies continue to struggle to play-catch-up with Tesla, by 2035, I think the Tesla Stock has the potential to rise to $6,000 from where it is now (and, of course, we can expect it to have split further by then).

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 13:17:47'] More like $30 a share. If they "execute" really well that is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 09:37:58'] The value is basically ignoring all the competition they face on the market. Yes the tech stuff is nice and all, but FSD will come from a lot of companies, and tbh I still believe that Waymo is the best option as they can literally supply anyone and still make cash. If Tesla hands out the FSD tech, they might as well kill their own car business. Battery tech is where the Chinese (CATL, BYD) and Koreans are going to lead (Samsung). Also it's ridiculous that same people believe they can keep up that growth factors until they sell like 15+ million cars a year. First of all you gotta find the double amount of buyers each year. 100-200k per year isn't that hard, especially when you have a lot of hype and fanboys. The main problem is getting the average buyer to get one of these instead of an VW or Toyota. It's getting harder from now on.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 10:29:50'] Ahh so Tesla will be worth $3T in a few years. That‚Äôs 3x what the entire auto industry was worth (mkt cap) in 2019, at the height of vehicle sales in world history. Today the industry is worth ~$2.5T. In 2025 it‚Äôll be worth at least $5T if no other auto makers valuation changes and tsla reaches $3T. So 500% industry valuation increase on probably 10% increase in collective vehicle sales. if TSLA goes to $3T, rest of the automakers will go bankrupt. If they don‚Äôt go bankrupt, TSLA can‚Äôt get to anywhere near $3T

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-07 11:11:18'] Let's put it this way, if TSLA can actually manage to mass produce the cybertruck & the tesla semi, they will have a large market cap on the auto industry. But that won't be enough to make them a 1 or 2 trillion company.What they must do, and they do know this is to be a mass producer on battery that they can sell.And then, the big thing. They must be a provider of energy, just google top 10 largest companys on earth the majority are " gas & oil " aka energy. This is where things can change, and tesla can actually be the next generation company when it comes to providing energy.

I started the year heavy on energy and conservative tech (MSFT, AAPL, BABA, etc), but I bailed on it in the middle of the Jan runup because it started to look overvalued and I'd made enough to be happy with the year.My overriding investment strategy right now is to minimize losses and take wins.  It's working out very well, but I'm hopeful to buy & hold for the long term when things settle down.  I'm comfortable missing the start of a run-up.

Second point is that the US spends the most on healthcare in the world and this amount is growing every year and with new viruses and stuff forming in the world I feel like investing in US healthcare whether ETFs or stocks is a no brainier thing to do. Combine that with the unregulated prescription drugs market in the US and you got a money making machine.

Previous trial in Australia was halted due to tremendous success. Endoxifen is a metabolite of the current standard of care for breast cancer (Tamoxifen) but with far fewer side effects, so high chance of being fast-tracked to market and replacing Tamoxifen ($680M/year market). CEO has made it clear he wants to sell the company to big pharma as soon as possible. Oh and they‚Äôre sitting on a mountain of cash (+100M) which is actually more than current market cap (90M). Risky of course, but a steal at current price with 30x upside if the drug goes to market. I‚Äôm swinging for the early retirement fence with this one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 04:45:31'] Tesla, to me, is a long term play. (5 years minimum...More like 2030+ or at the very least till when they have transitioned fully into an energy company). "Problem" is that I bought in so low that if I threw all my cash reserves at it today it would only add a fraction to my current position. While I do think Tesla has a stellar future I'm not about to go 100% YOLO into just one stock without any reserve. So for me (unfortunately) there's not much point in buying more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 22:14:37'] Tbh doesn‚Äôt matter what price to me, i‚Äôll just buy it whenever i catch it on big red days & hold the shares. If i ever need money for a property deal ill just take out a loan against my shares & use the cash flow to payback the loan + interest.With giga berlin & austin up & running, tesla is no longer facing serious capex hits & can begin farming profits. 6 people i personally know have traded in their ice cars for brand new teslas with gas prices so elevated. My hope is that this is going on with the mass populace as well. Many new construction homes & custom home builds that i‚Äôve walked recently have built-in ev chargers in the garage. There is a shift to ev its just a matter of where all the market share goes & if tesla can retain its lead within that share.But for me personally, i only invest whatever im willing to lose & make sure i save a large enough cash pile to dca if need be. Everyone‚Äôs strategy is different so i‚Äôm sure regardless what anyone says in this thread you‚Äôll do whatever you think is the best decision for you.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 07:34:35'] Not buying above $420. Too overvalued for me and it had it's rally. As always, what goes up should always come down. People who tell you otherwise haven't been in the market for too long. Be patient. It's okay if you miss the bus. They are plenty of other stocks that are actually fairly valued or even undervalued. But what you don't want is getting hit by a train with "get rekt" written on it after you bought shares of already overvalued company thinking it would go up crazy. I'm not saying not to take risks but don't forget to adjust your risk. All this is for someone who is gonna buy Tesla for the first time or don't have a Tesla share currently. For you, just DCA in bro. Try to bring down your avg price. There's nothing more to it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 23:11:02'] Evaluate TSLA is just extremely hard. So I don‚Äôt touch it.In general one can ignore price targets. If they would be worth anything investing would be simple.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 23:05:02'] I think the biggest problem is that once the bigger auto manufacturers like Toyota, Porsche and BMW go electric it will definitely steal market share from Tesla. Right now there's really not a lot of options to chose from if you want an EV car. In few years once Toyota and other car manufacturers enter the EV market it will definitely be much harder to maintain the market share. Toyota is much better at manufacturing and quality then Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 20:49:41'] It is not the next year or two of sales that concern me.  For me the concern is whether they can maintain their share of market when companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, etc. finally get serious about EVs.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 04:56:41'] Technical point of view, around 300-350 I would start buying, but through a macro economical point of view, it's the best time to liquidate everything other than real estate, cause usually it's bubble has a delay before bursting, then wait and see how this recession turns out, wait to hear the bells and the institutional liquidations.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 06:12:45'] TSLA has always been about its long term growth. what they achieved from 2013-2019 got them to where they today. And what they are doing today will keep them growing strong, and dominately so, over the the next 5-10 years and beyond.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 06:32:09'] $550 or under.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 06:39:23'] Personally, I think Tesla is worth about 200 bn similar to Toyota if everything goes right.that's approximately $200 a share, so I guess if it drops under that significantly, I will buy some. I'm definitely not buying Tesla at $800 bn lol, 4x Toyota is imo is by far the best car company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 06:53:24'] I bought in on the last dip at 595. I couldn't afford to buy in at 400 when I originally wanted to get in. The stock spilt already once between those moments. I'm certain it will again. Just do it even if its fractional.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 07:01:58'] Why not!? It's going to split for share holders. Why wouldn't anyone want some Tesla shares. Especially at these levels. Listen to everything you were taught and you learned. How many times have the "experts" been correct/wrong? I would buy!

I would likely buy in at 150 but chances are if it dropped to 150 it is because they are missing targets, someone posts a high profile video of someone trapped and in a burning car, or they have some major recall or who knows what weird event could befall them. In which case I likely wouldn't buy in till it is lower then that even.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 04:50:40'] lol price targets.  :)&#x200B;Will tsla go up again? probably.  long term I'm kinda bearish,  short term a timid bullish. Reason being. As more people realize that Tsla does have valid competition,  the attractiveness will wane and price goes down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-10 05:45:38'] I've always thought a great way to price small cap stocks is to ask yourself, if you had $100 billion (or some obscene amount of money, but not richest on earth), how much would you be willing to pay to own this company. Obviously TSLA is $1 trillion, but the point of the question is, how much are you willing to pay for control of the company. How much are you willing to pay to buy enough of TSLA to be able to walk in there and tell some manager there to kick rocks - again, assuming you had enough money to do this. Frankly, there are very few other companies I would be willing to gain control of before TSLA (MSFT, NIO, and IBM -yes I kno it's an odd choice).... Tesla is one of those companies that is massive and yet is also poised to grow significantly. I personally would want to know more about the viability of Optimus. But ultimately, I would pay $100b for 10% of Tesla (so $1T market cap). I would think for most things, 10% wouldn't be enough to get what I want in terms of strategy/direction, but it would definitely buy me a say. However, anything over about $1200 per share would mean I wouldn't be able to buy enough shares to have an impact, so I would probably lose interest. However, if I had some rich friends, we could pool our billions together, so $1200 is reasonable given expectations of growth.

No cars to make (or have a risk of spontaneously starting on fire), no huge competition (i.e. GM, Ford, Toyota, etc), no union issues to deal with, etc. Too boot, has a huge cash hoard reserve as a safety net.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 20:49:17'] Anybody saying TSLA is either a fanboy or a gambler. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it is a great company, it‚Äôs just a shit stock (imo). GOOGL is the modern Berkshire, with great holdings, great cash flow, decent valuation and room for growth. As a bonus, you‚Äôll even indirectly hold a stake in SpacEx.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 22:51:36'] GOOGL hands down. It has a much larger moat and a proven track record e.g profitability.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 04:39:53'] None of this. If you are school teachers, you both need to open up 457 deferred compensation plans through your district and start contributing there in addition to your 403b. The 457 allows for additional contributions of $20,500 or $27,500 depending on your age. Use your employee benefits first! You might even have a Roth option available depending on what your employee offers you.

With their agile processes they continue to improve margins. And will be the company that sells the $25k EV for the masses.  \- Is the only company that has the data to solve Self driving cars on a large scale, because of their datalead.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 07:14:58'] Long term an index fund is by far the most reliable way to make money, though your returns may be mediocre compared to individual stocks.  I always recommend this for most or all of people's investment money.If you insist on putting some into high-flying growth stocks and TSLA vs GOOGL in particular: GOOGL is more likely to be higher long-term because they have more moat in their business model and their stock is more fairly priced right now.  TSLA has potentially more upside because they are in rapidly growing areas, but they will face much more competition and their stock is hugely overpriced right now, and so even if they succeed their stock price may not be higher than today.5 years from now I am 95% sure GOOGL will be significantly higher (more than 50% price increase) than today.  10 years from now I am 99% sure GOOGL will be significantly higher than today.5 years from now I am 50% sure TSLA will be significantly higher (more than 50% price increase) than today.  10 years from now I am 33% sure TSLA will be significantly higher than today.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 09:41:22'] Well, most of my money is in TSLA, and I'm up 500%.  I don't know if now is a great time to buy though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 10:23:14'] I personally feel like GOOG has been getting greedy recently, but I am heavily invested into TSLA, so I am pretty biased. I think TSLA will supplant AAPL as the most valuable company in the next 5-10 years and think they will grow into their current valuation. That said, both are good options and both will likely continue to grow. Looking at your edit, do make sure you keep a cash pile of at least 3 months expenses, and ideally 6 months by the time you retire.

Usually it is about 13% a year, sometimes more and sometimes ends in a loss.That said, you are debating investing in Tesla, why? What do you know about Tesla? What do you know about Google? Why would either of them continue growing? Why Google instead of Apple? Or Microsoft? Or Amazon?Personally, I am not touching Tesla even if it drops to $600.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 03:02:51'] I think tsla might be going downhill in a 5 year horizon. Totally overvalued and other real car makers are catching up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 03:28:29'] Don‚Äôt go all in one stock if it‚Äôs not money you can‚Äôt afford to see some loss on - given the current market bubble (ATH every month) I‚Äôd advise diversification. Alternatively you could identify your highest confidence stocks and commit to them.I‚Äôd suggest Microsoft, Google, Apple & NVDA or something.Alternatively do as others have recommended and diversify across an industry (e.g. Nasdaq for tech).Reasons for the above stock are as follows:MSFT: dividend yield of ~0.8% and >30% profit margin on >160bn revenues. Est current value of 345 (+3% on current) in addition 75% of computers OS is Microsoft.GOOG: you know this one I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt need to explain.AAPL: self explanatory - huge growth, 26% profit margin on ~$320bn annual revenues no chance of losing its market share given current performance and our addiction to iPhones as a western society. Provides 16% of the world OS also.NVDA: huge competitive position in a high demand sector with no sign of stopping. Currently down from ATH since omnicron scare. Market share of ~20%(Not financial advice)

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 05:26:11'] Buying TSLA today to hold for 5+ years is a very bad play, imo.They are finally getting real competition from the big producers.  Tesla's competitive advantages are shrinking rapidly.  There is no way to justify the current valuation unless you assume they will re-disrupt another massive industry.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 05:55:54'] Both are pretty overvalued. As we are in the later stages of a bull market, investor optimism is at an all time high, which has pushed prices up. I‚Äôm asking you specifically to not invest in Tesla though, as it will most certainly crash, unless you believe that in the long term it will become worth 50% of current US GDP (20 trillion) like these clowns are claiming.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 23:25:17'] What do you think has the most growth potential  and what company can you stand behind more? Its questions like these you have to ask yourself. The people touting index funds are correct that it's a safe bet but will only be a fraction of growth compared to other companies like tesla. It's an innovator and a game changer that will shift the course of history. Imo google doesnt have anything new planned and it's at the end of its rope in terms of growth.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 06:57:59'] Tesla is valued in tulip territory.  It‚Äôs a car company, people are stupid.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 07:10:11'] Take a diversified approach. Also, I personally believe Tesla is very over-valued at the moment. I think their moat is shrinking as pretty much every other car manufacturer is moving into electric in a big way within the next year or two. At the same time, if web3 becomes a thing and a ‚Äúdecentralized internet‚Äù gets built and adopted, Google could be in some trouble. But the horizon on that would be at least 5 to 10 years away. Plus, Google is in a position to capitalize on that opportunity as well.Have you just thought about getting a bunch of ETF‚Äôs that track the S&P 500? Sounds like that approach might meet your investment goals.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-27 05:26:38'] Google but I would suggest you don't put it into these all at once but with DCA. This way you'll be less prone to volatility.That said, depending on how large of a % that 30k is of your portfolio, you could hold it as a cash cushion for when there are some real sales on stocks that you want. You may hear of some stock that's really cool 1 year from now but without the cash you'll need to sell other stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 18:26:14'] Probably gonna get downvoted because ppl only like the hype crap but I think a long term hold to consider is something gold related - gold mining, gold bullion, gold royalty. Reason for this is frankly pretty depressing - debt is possibly at a point of no return, politics getting more and more problematic, and likely either party will only increase debt, 500 basis point increase in fed rate after a decade of almost 0 rate has consequences that haven‚Äôt even been revealed, social security will be an issue pretty soon (Stanley druckenmiller predicts sometime 2025-2035, my vote on it being earlier than later), de-globalization and de-dollarization has only just started. Those are just the things at the top of my mind, I could come up with more. Btw I have never once held gold anytime before so I‚Äôm not a long term gold bull just trying to sell the idea. I‚Äôve only just recently started a position in this asset class. Some would say in this case you should get bitcoin instead but i personally have doubt about bitcoin and would rather go with gold that has historically proven itself.

A large problem with them currently is profit margins. Though they're invested in both plant-based proteins and cultured meats. There's risks, but they are on the verge of  solving a lot their operational expense problems (livestock management, feed sourcing, labor cost). Given their relative historical valuation, they're a good option to pickup for the long term

POST: ['2023-05-27 16:56:59'] POST TITLE: b'Not all "tech" companies deserve to have tech valuations'
POST_TEXT: b"I often hear a lot about how this & that company are the next Amazon so the PE ratio does not apply to them.\n\nThere's a simple question that can tell you whether a company can have tech PEs: do they have unique products that enable them to grow their profit exponentially while keeping their costs linear? If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS & not their retail side. \n\nFor example:\n\nUber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence & its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable & likely never will be.\n\nTSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking & getting closer to all other car manufacturers.\n\nNVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand "
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:32:41'] "datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand surge & after one or two quarters, the demand will go down just like the crypto craze."This is basically the same as the infamous (and wildly wrong) quote"No one will need more than 637 kb of memory for a personal computer" - Bill GatesHistorically speaking, while there are short-term fluctuations in the demand for powerful chips, long-term demand always goes up
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:41:02'] Your point about NVDA doesn‚Äôt make sense. More powerful GPUs are unlocking more powerful AI applications. I foresee this trend continuing, which means data centers will need more GPUs over time because their old GPUs won‚Äôt be able to handle the latest models. Personally, I think NVDA is over valued, but not for the reason you listed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:20:53'] It was argued by many that some tech companies like AAPL now deserve "staple multiples", which are even higher than tech multiples. The problem really is one where there is so much money floating around that investors will say whatever to rationalize the present outrageous valuations across the board.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:49:54'] By this metric basically this only really leaves software/data companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:31:12'] This isn't a tech vs. non tech issue, but more of one where people see "growth(!!!!)" and then don't think about what it might grow into. Tesla is a great example of that in that it there are companies that one can see as 85th percentile outcome (Mercedes) and 99.5th percentile outcomes (Toyota) and then 99.9999 percentile outcomes (somehow much bigger than Toyota) and find that all the valuations of these excellent outcomes are already more than priced in. Its one thing when there is something totally new--like, who knows with this internets thingy how big petsdotcom could get--but shouldn't be ignored when you are dealing with more or less known industries.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 17:23:40'] Ok... You gave some examples of tech companies which don't deserve their valuations. Which tech companies *do* deserve their valuations?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:16:10'] Totally agree on Uber, even more goes for Doordash and the like. At least Uber started out undercharging rides to undercut the market, there was a real benefit to the service they offered vs historic methods.(Sidebar: anyone remember Uber and Lyft leaning hard into driverless cabs? Imagine that was a fruitless money sink, Tesla has more chance of creating that service, given that is a pipe-dream now, any justification for tech sector prices left with it)Food delivery services on the other hand have inserted themselves into a system and take significant margin from take-out services, under pay their staff and triple charge customers (increased menu prices vs. phoning an order in, platform service charge and increasing tip need to even get it delivered).  Beyond a joke they can‚Äôt make money despite screwing every party of the transaction over.What room do they have to grow to make profitability? The service is already falling apart.Couldn‚Äôt even make money during the pandemic‚Ä¶ smh. That‚Äôs a sector crying out for AI, just put delivery costs out to bid based on live demand vs supply (let the drivers pick the pay rate they‚Äôll take) run a delivery support service only, integrate with existing delivery services (Uber etc) /rant over, fuck doordash

Last I checked you can‚Äôt get paid for a low PE ratio.Nvidia is insanely overvalued based on standard analysis but it can remain this way for a long time. When institutions fall in love with a stock it‚Äôs not a trend you want to fight.This is the undisputed leader in the hottest industry that is hungrier and hungrier for GPUs and software to leverage them. Investing is not about being right, it‚Äôs about buying stocks that go up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:59:13'] None of these posts really have an intimate understanding of why GPUs are crucial to ML nor how ML works.Our economy has been turbo-blasted by deep learning since roughly 2000. The reason why wasn't some fundamental breakthrough in computer science, it was because we finally had enough compute to make these large scale networks learn and interpolate without it taking forever. Deep learning impacted the economy because HARDWARE got better. We've had the "recipe" for deep learning since like the 50s.Similarly, LLMs aren't really all that different from deep learning and the idea has been "around" for a while. The most impactful breakthrough was the discovery of something called "attention" and "transformers" but this is really just an interation in the something called a recurrent neural network, which again is something that's been around since the 1970s. So again, the reason for this compute is HARDWARE related.If data is the new oil, then GPUs (or better yet TPUs or other ML focused architectures) are the pump jack.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:24:50'] If you see people throwing in ‚Äútech valuation‚Äù as a conversation when their business has no good fundamental basis, you know they are stretching it.This is given that valuation is based on business fundamentals such as growth, margin, returns on equity etc., or other metrics such as users as a guesstimate of the potential.These companies (NVIDIA, etc.) may have stretched PE with very optimistic investors, but it is not necessarily because of ‚Äútech valuation‚Äù. After all, large part of the valuation of a growth company is in the future.

Like nvdia with the around 200 PE ratio. Come on, anyone who buys a stock at that PE is just asking for trouble. I know I will be downvoted for this but it is plain stupidity to buy any stock over 40-50 PE. Look back at IBM how many poeple bought into it in its height. Or any dotcom stock back then. Sell at this high price while you can, it won't be like this forever. And yes give me downvotes, if I can help at least one person with this post not to lose more than 50% of their portfolio because of a crazy overvalued stock I would take it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 12:17:31'] Flip side, if Bill ever decides to unwind that short it‚Äôs going to generate massive upside
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 12:04:36'] I'm concerned about the next quarterly report, so yeah, the shorts are likely right. There is a longer term argument about whether Tesla is close to a plateau as car business. There are only so many vehicles they can build in a given quarter and while they have significant demand now, I don't know if you can say the same once the other car manufacturers (VW, Hyundai, KIA, Ford, GM, BMW, XPENG, NIO, etc.) are all online and expanding capacity and deliveries. Same goes with the self driving tech and charging tech, which Tesla leads right now, but are being challenged on all sides by significant players.Each year that passes, Tesla will find in more challenging (ie. expensive) to keep its lead. They're still benefiting from first mover advantage, but in today's tech/economic climate, their lead margin will be very difficult to defend and expand. Now you've got Elon distracted by Twitter and his other side projects (not to mention SpaceX, which is obviously not a side project). He's got a strong leadership team to keep Telsa in top spot for a while longer, but Elon is Tesla's best salesman and they need him to keep focused on selling Tesla and less on his other side gigs. Teslavangelists will keep pumping because they believe Tesla is about more than just cars. While this may be true in 10+ years, at the moment, their current business is about cars and should be judged on their car-related revenue. When they start making money from their data, software, androids, solar, battery storage, or whatever, I'll consider it then.For now, the shorts are well aware of the current market conditions and will take advantage. There are more headwinds than tailwinds for 2022. I expect the stock price will consolidate in a range or head lower, but a significant bullish reversal is unlikely for this year. Hope I'm wrong because I do hold a long position in Tesla myself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-07 10:43:53'] Bill shorted back when TSLA was $400.  Since then it inched up to $800, then raced from $900 to $1200.  As long as Bill isn't conspiring with others to generate fake news/FUD to drive the price down I don't see this being a 'weighty anchor'.  Seeing it hit $2k in 2024 and knowing it is screwing Bill will be nice.re: the eventual "competition is coming" circle jerk here.  There were a bunch of 'tesla killer' articles in 2015.  That's a buy signal -- as more people look into EVs, and actually start comparing features, prices and when it can actually be delivered... Tesla sells more.  The competition may eventually catch up in 5-10 years on features and production capacity, but they still won't be able to match on profit margin.   This is an Apple situation - in 5-10 years they will only have ~20% of the market, but the lions share of the profits.edit: macro environment is not great for any tech stock.  TSLA above $1100 in the next 3 months could be a good shorting opportunity.  Shorting TSLA above $1100 in 3-6 months could be unwise.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 16:35:16'] People always regret not buying APPL, AMZN, MSFT and so on, but then continue to shit on the company of the decade just because it's seemingly trading at a premium. TSLA is such a nobrainer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 09:29:40'] I have over $350,000 invested in Tesla at today's prices. While I'm still a strong believer in the company, I've been putting some serious thought into taking some profits.The main reason I'm considering selling doesn't have anything to do with Tesla's fundamentals, it's about diversifying my wealth. My $20,000 Tesla investment has become over a quarter of my net worth. When I spoke to a financial advisor they said I should limit any one investment to either 5 to 10 percent of my portfolio, which would mean selling at least half of my 400 shares.If I do sell it'll probably be 50 to 100 shares, with perhaps more being sold at a later date.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 08:05:39'] Tesla is still aiming at a yearly 50% growth rate - which I think is realistic for the next 2-3 years with two major factories coming online shortly and demand for current (and future) products out the wazoo...even if they built nothing else and stopped all expansion efforts beyond the ones already in the pipe today.PE is not a good metric for a growth stock like that (or just extrapolate such a growth rate and you will notice that PE comes back into a relatively normal range very quickly)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 10:11:32'] I just disagree with this thesis. Tesla stock has been detached from reality its entire trading history. To act like $900 is absurd but $750 is totally fine or hell $500 just doesn't make sense. 6 months ago their PE was over 1000 today it's under 300, what has changed to make them seem MORE overvalued now then before?Imo there is only one relevant question to answer when buying Tesla stock. Are you willing to buy an overvalued stock or not? Because Tesla will ALWAYS trade at a huge multiple. If you are comfortable with the risk and believe the fundamentals of the business will continue to grow then buy the stock, if not then don't, it's that simple.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 11:30:50'] It's hit 900 before you know.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 15:41:30'] Why would you sell at this level if you are a long term bull? If you want to talk about valuation: Their PE is getting slashed every quarter as they continue to scale up, and their profit will increase at a higher rate than their delivery number as the marginal cost to produce extra vehicles goes down significantly once you achieve economies of scale. $900 for today‚Äôs Tesla is expensive sure, but $2,500 for TSLA  in 2025 or 2030 most likely won‚Äôt be, and you just have to discount your way back to the present day to figure out a price you are willing to pay today. Go look at AAPL‚Äôs and AMZN‚Äôs charts and you will want to hold. Why sell unless something fundamentally changes about the company?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 11:55:11'] This seems way grounded to reality than earlier in the year where the P/E ratio is around 800 though. To maintain the same 800 P/E ratio, TSLA would've been almost $2700. I'm just holding though. There are way worse choice you can make.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 07:55:12'] I sold out at 750ish.  I had a sudden realization about how massively overvalued this company is and sold my position.   While I continue to watch the price of this stock rise, I am not upset.  This stock will eventually correct, and I do not want to be around when it does.  It has a PE ratio of 482 for Christ sakes!!!!!That being said, it is a great company with great financials.  I wish I would have invested a few years ago.

They‚Äôre so much more than a car company and anyone who thinks otherwise is a delusional bear.Tesla innovated the entire automobile sector with their E- cars. They, most notably Musk of course, were the very first one to believe that E- cars are going to be the future. I really have a lot of respect for them.That all being said, I don't believe they are going to be able to compete against Toyota or Volkswagen over time.These big players have a lot more experience in the automobile market, their technology is getting better and their production capacity is going to be the real competitive advantage they have over Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 09:42:12'] I bought a single share @ $500 pre-split, and have been riding the lightning ever since. Will it fall? Probably. Do I care? Not a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 09:53:35'] What does detached from reality mean?  You have a company that no one can compete with. Only one of those competitors has even Realized it ‚ÄîVolkswagen.They have what can only be interpreted as unlimited demand as their only challenge is making the cars faster. Oh and they are putting online two of the largest auto manufacturing plants in the world this quarter.Volkswagen and industry insiders say they need 5 years at least to catch up with innovations that have been in production from Tesla for months.  Tesla has a 30% gross margin on autos and this is before the major innovations implemented in the two brand new factories. It also does not include the new batteries that cost 50% of what current batteries used.  This means that Tesla will eventually be pushing out units with 50% gross margins that eventually will be majority of fleet.  Meanwhile legacy auto makes uncompetitive units that have a negative gross margin.The demand for EVs is a one way street and currently people would rather wait 6 months for a Tesla than to buy a cheaper ice, largely because it is a terrible purchase to buy a completely obsolete car for $40K vs a $60K Tesla which has realized virtually zero depreciation over last 3 years.The manufacturing prowess and brand leadership of Tesla auto alone justifies price. But you get the free options on Tesla‚Äôs AI and energy business. Not owning Tesla at $900 per share is just plain stupid.

If they keep this trend going they will be the fifth largest company in america. Insane
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 15:00:55'] I don't get how anyone can say it's overvalued. It makes NO sense. If you annualize Q3, Tesla is at a PE of 190. In 2021 and 2022 they are likely to grow close around 80% in unit sales, revenue by 70% and net income by 1,100% in 2021 and at least another 100% in 2022. If this indeed happens, they'd be at a trailing PE of 52 by the end of 2022.How can anyone say that's a fair value for a company that's growing this fast despite a ton of headwinds and has increased margins to double their competition's over a single year while showing no sign of slowing down (imagine what happens to margins when they've ramped up two new factories that will each produce more cars than both their current factories combined, the need to ship cars around the planet disappears and they bring online their single piece gigacasting machines...).Even if you completely disregard FSD, which if they can make it work would instantly make them the most valuable company on the planet, it's still extremely undervalued if you have an investing horizon of longer than 2 years.

Apple was iPhone hardware company and now moving to services.Tesla will gradually get in services once all giga factories are up, most likely in insurance first and then charging stations will make money (10-20M vehicles on road) , better FSD/AI.Also, people forget how Blackberry and Nokia were left to dust when Apple iPhone came in(much better product and huge fan following). I see Tesla brand as same status or even better status symbol then Apple to own currently and this will not die in next 5-10 years.I have not even mentioned energy yet.This is an American Tech company driven by growth, not a legacy firm.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 15:50:33'] Saw an analyst saying yesterday that if they continue to grow at current rates for 3-4 years, they should hit 6-1 earnings like other major tech companies. Which would put their stock price at something like $2,400 within that time period.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 10:28:41'] I agree Tesla is a good car company but they can increase annual sales by 200% and they would still sell about 1/4 the amount of cars that Ford does. It's not an 800 billion dollar company, it's current valuation makes absolutely no sense. It certainly wouldn't make sense for them to be a trillion dollar company either.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-21 11:56:20'] I'm glad someone is thinking straight about Tesla. I'm a fan myself but I think they've potentially got years of growth and innovation already priced in. The fact that their market cap is greater than the next 5 largest automotive companies in the world combined and sell a fraction the vehicles & services is astounding. They did have a first runners advantage but even that is fading away and many other companies are doing the same thing or more better than Tesla. Not to mention the actual feasibility of EV's to the average consumer is still just unreasonable at the moment and will be until the infrastructure to accommodate a large scale transition to EV's takes hold. In my opinion within 10 years Tesla will be irrelevant. They'll probably still be a player in the EV industry but they won't be *the* company associated with EV innovation that they are now.

Main question though you have to ask is risk/ reward or upside/ downside odds. Imo, Teslas probability of getting 100% more gain from here is limited due to its current size. However, i might be totally wrong. Tesla is like crypto, you can‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs gonna happen to it. My advice is look for other opportunities where there is more upside potential.

I know the ‚Äúthey‚Äôre different‚Äù argument, but that same argument has been used on many companies in the past that wound up tanking, and while some did prove they really are different (e.g. Amazon), they‚Äôre the exception and not the rule.I don‚Äôt mind if Tesla keeps running and I miss out. In fact, I hope it keeps running, because I want to see how far it can climb. I have to stick to the principles of value investing in order to avoid getting caught in an unrecoverable disaster. That said, I also trade, and Tesla is a great stock to scalp options on.

POST: ['2021-10-01 12:43:18'] POST TITLE: b'Just sold half of my holdings in TSLA.'
POST_TEXT: b"      After months of weighing options I decided this was the best move for my family.\n\n      I've been in TSLA since 2015 when I decided to invest as a single mother,  and never sold even when times were hard. TSLA ended up being a huge blessing for me and my son over the years!\n \n        I made it through work being closed down for 9 months last year and half of this year, and never sold.     \n       So, this step took alot for me, on a personal level.\n\n      Because of my job being effected half of this year, my income was no where close to what it would have normally been...       I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is. I also knew that with my income being as low as it was this year, that this was possibly the last opportunity to avoid selling in a higher tax bracket.\n\n        Of course, I had this mental struggle between selling and it then going higher.  But I've decided to just not let myself think on those terms.\n    "
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 12:44:47'] Congratulations, no shame in taking profits. I think you made a great choice, especially about holding onto half!

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 12:54:57'] Congrats! I think you are wise. I'm still confident in tesla and musk but the stock is already so damn high.What was your initial investment and how much did you end up cashing out if you don't mind me asking?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 10:28:00'] There's a reason burrys biggest position is puts against tesla. Market is going down most longs hold tesla so they will sell off to cover margin calls etc fire sales.it's going to burn up but it will be a great time to buy the tesla dip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 13:32:23'] Well done - never wrong taking profit...
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 10:14:01'] When ever I believe a stock has peaked I sell half. This way if it runs up more you still benefit. And if it drops you still keep most of your gains.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 10:16:32'] Congrats on having the conviction to hold Tesla for so long first and foremost! That‚Äôs great discipline!At this point Tesla is a giant and Elon is the richest man in the world‚Äîyou can be confident that if you miss out on any growth it won‚Äôt be much. You have people like Cathie Woods also exiting the position.. I legit am super happy for you! I was super bullish on Tesla for a long time but didn‚Äôt have the funds to pursue the investment.. now that I do I‚Äôm looking for a high growth stock like that‚Ä¶ maybe Dutch Bros?‚Ä¶

I hope your work and every other situation in your life improves with this move and continues to improve after the pandemic is over.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 20:57:14'] Thanks for sticking it out through those dark times. It was hard on everyone holding. I always appreciate how good hearted TSLA shareholders are. Congratulations on your earnings!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 16:18:47'] Congrats! For anyone else thinking the same, I'd advise waiting until Monday, as they will announce Sept delivery numbers this weekend and all indicators point to a blow out month.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 00:24:58'] Out of curiosity, what sort of gains are you guys getting at the moment or cashed in at on TSLA?
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 13:07:14'] I‚Äôm very bullish on Tesla. I‚Äôm hoping it splits again :)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 16:34:58'] I can't speak to whether cashing out is good or bad.  I can think of a couple cash outs I did that would have netted millions, but at the time I did it, I would have been defying all financial sense not to.On the other hand, I know of times I should have taken gains, and suffered substantial losses by the false dogma of "buy and hold".The tie breaker in your case is the tax situation.  If you're indeed right, then yes it's best to take gains during a low tax window.  Some will say that selling half is wrong.  They said if you are deciding to keep half invested, then that's your decision, and cutting it goes against your own decision.  I tend to disagree, because I've learned that for individual stock investors, emotion and psyche are relevant factors.  I track mine in a journal, including worries, ideas, any thoughts I have pertaining to current or future market moves.  Then I go back review the old ones during weekends and closed market days.  It's interesting to track how beliefs and emotions can drive good and bad decisions, and knowing yourself plus that track record and help you calibrate and improve.Therefore, taking out half for peace of mind could very well be beneficial to your investing, if you apply it in a similar way.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 06:50:01'] Tesla Inc.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 17:55:48'] Just a thought but if you have an IRA and deposit money into that you can also avoid some more taxes, if you can afford to let it sit in there. Bonus you can buy on the dip with that account. Tax exempt when you trade. You pay for it later though. Don't do this if you need to access it again though.

I've sold it throughout the years when it hits a peak I'm comfortable with and buy less when it drops some to rebalance my portfolio. At one point had 156 shares with a cost basis of around $250 pre-split...As much as I wish to have held on in hindsight, it was the right decision.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-01 15:14:27'] First off, congrats on the gains! I respect what you are doing by taking some of the money off the table. That being said, I am holding onto my [Tesla shares until we see their gross margins rise closer to $RACE](https://viz.wiijii.co/chart/?id=-Mkxuo3E5jtd-5bQ3qWf) (Ferrari).

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 00:53:58'] A well played strategic decision, maybe could have made it a bit earlier. Any investment largely over its 200 day EMA should be checked for a possible profit talking ( below 200 Day EMA for possible buying opportunities) Of course, this means stepping away from optimum performance to a more conservative one. How much ‚Äûlargely‚Äú is, depends on your goals. Sounds simple, but is actually hard to do for everyone. At the end, you have taken risk off from your position in TSLA, based on your strategic long term risk assessment, which seems to ‚Äûfeel right‚Äú for you. So again, well done!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 02:14:50'] I hope you didn‚Äôt completely exit your position

I'm happy I sold my half last year while work was still impacted greatly from Covid.I'm also happy I sold given the current economic chaos.I've been just holding on to 30k. It's not in any investment . Just sitting as cash available for trading.I'm considering paying down my mortgage, putting a large  potion into good and silver and if  Bitcoin drops below where I bought in at 22k I may put a little in there to DCA.I'm hoping and believing TSLA will split again within the next year, personally.Anyway, I wanted to give an update, as I had quite a few comments mocking me for selling, as the price did go up after that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-02 12:30:33'] So, after sleeping on it, and seeing the comment about q3 being amazing and that I sold too soon.     My only thought, is that I would have rather sold this amount before it continued to climb. Because it would have been more of a gain that I would pay taxes on.       Sure the profit would have been nice. But I'm teeter tottering on entering another tax bracket right now.        I own a spa and it just opened up this week after a huge closure stemming from Covid.    So between the rest of this year and a huge growth in income possibly. I didn't want my tax bracket to rise too much for tax purposes.       If that's a dumb rationale, hey I never claimed to be a pro       It just makes sense to me that if I want to reduce position for security reasons while avoiding taxes as much as possible, why would I wait for a possible huge gain after Q3 earnings report? I'd rather get the gains after on what is staying in TSLA

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 19:00:02'] He already took his decision. He posted this because he knew the outcome of the survey.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 00:22:18'] Apparently the general believe seems to be that he‚Äôs going to dump all these shares on the open market, which is not how multibillion dollar stakes are being sold by banks or insiders. Instead, his bank is going to place the order in a dark pool, a private marketplace only accessible to other large investors & firms, specifically designed to move massive amounts of shares, that would otherwise upset the public market due to the incredibly high volume. This happens every single day with every major company and without going through filings, you won‚Äôt find out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 18:17:19'] Not being invested into TSLA, so I will grab some popcorn.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 20:35:46'] Elon has stock options expiring in June that he has to do something about. He doesn‚Äôt have cash so he has to rather take a loan out to pay to exercise the options OR sell Tesla stock.This is something he HAS TO do, but it sounds like he wants to let the public decide.Saw some math on Twitter and the thinking is he may end up with more tesla stock after this all unfolds, due to all the options he will be exercising. And like $15B of taxes will be paid.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 22:46:48'] Probably a short-term dip followed by people buying back up the dip and another bull run as soon as he announces that he has completed the stock sell.For anybody that believes in Tesla for the long-term, my recommendation would be to just chill out and hold. What Elon does this month doesn't matter. It is what Tesla does over the next decade that matters. And don't press your luck by trying to time a sell-off and then buy-back as you might end up getting screwed like the people who sold after Musk made his "price is too high" tweet last year.And if this dip is significant enough, maybe think about taking advantage of that to buy some more if you were looking to increase your position. From experience, I can bet that many people are going to ignore that last bit of advice about buying the dip and then FOMO once this short-term noise is over and Tesla rockets up to new all-time highs again because that is what people always do with Tesla stock time and time again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 18:52:01'] Remember when he went out and straight said the stock price was too high when it was in the $700s. Everyone freaked out. Then the stock continued marching upward anyway.His decision to sell has nothing to do with Tesla being overpriced. Plenty of people are ready to buy any dip
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 18:33:25'] If you're a long term investor it's irrelevant.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 18:37:20'] My understanding is that he can't actually sell anything until like 6 months afters he's made an official filing that he intends to sell some shares since he's an insiderHe'd obviously also not sell all of it in one dayThat entire portion of stocks also wouldn't even be the equivelant of a days worth of traded shares for Tesla. So if he sells it over something like 3-6 months. You're talking about an average increase in shares being sold daily barely in the 1-2% rangeIn short I think the way he's going about this is a lot more dramatic than the actual process that would take place if he does it.I voted yes and have a sizeable amount of Tesla shares
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 21:39:12'] does his net worth calculation include options he holds? he can buy 22m shares for $6/sh in aug 2022.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 18:45:18'] Couple things. He wouldn‚Äôt have to and legally couldn‚Äôt instantly sell the entire thing all at once on Monday. Legally as Ceo he would have to sell after a waiting period after declaring the intention and it wouldn‚Äôt be handled by him directly. He could choose to do it in batches over time as well. Then there‚Äôs the fact that 25 billion dollars flowed through Tsla trading on Friday alone. It‚Äôs not like selling his shares couldn‚Äôt be easily slipped in with regular trading over the course of a week strategically by institutional traders. They do this all the time for whale trades. Share price is actually more likely to go up since the float would increase and allow for more buying opportunity. Ie see what happened when stock split or additional shares were issued. Stock always rose in price afterward since more buying liquidity was available.

I would sell, take profit to minimize the events. Even if Tesla bounces back, you can enter when things are positive. If your a call holder with a short DTE‚Ä¶your basically screwed. There will be a mass exit on Monday, causing the price of the calls to go down fast. With a short DTE call option, you can‚Äôt risk how far it may drop in the next month..
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 23:19:43'] Elon can sell ice to an eskimo. If he dumps his 10% someone will buy it and the stock will keep marching along.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 09:10:52'] Let‚Äôs just be honest here, Elon has played these markets really smart. He knows when he announces something about a stock, or crypto that ticker/coin will reflect on it. This man is going to cause a sell off, and guess what he‚Äôs going to do after? Buy more shares when it drops, and get even richer on the way back up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 19:22:57'] It is 2% of Tesla stock. I don‚Äôt think the effect will be as great as you all think. If Musk does end up selling, good for him for paying taxes. I hope this encourages more of the super wealthy to contribute and pay a larger percentage of taxes.

He‚Äôs especially doing it at this point because there‚Äôs so much speculation over a stock split and much higher potential earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 18:37:35'] It wouldn‚Äôt effect the stock price, only thing that might effect it is an overreaction from retail or institution.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 00:07:21'] This will probably be very unpopular, but this is my true opinion, please tolerate it. In a normal world Elon should have gone to prison for market manipulation a long time ago. But the SEC - and others - won't do anything until thousands/millions file a suit against Elon/Tesla for giving misleading information and manipulating prices (number of future sold cars, Bitcoin payment, Hertz contract,.just to mention a few). Really sorry for saying this. Tesla as a product is great, innovative. But with less than 1% of global sales the company's market capitalization is more than the 99% of the whole automotive industry. Everyone's homework: how and why.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 23:57:24'] I love all the people that have either zero shares or less than 20 on here that think this has any impact on the company. All the people that bought the fomo top deserve to lose money. This is 100% premeditated and planned by Elon. He didn‚Äôt wake up this morning and decide to do a Twitter poll for 10% of his net worth. There‚Äôs a bigger narrative in play and everyone that panic sells is going to look incredible stupid. I‚Äôve been an investor since 2018 and could care less about this noise. Tesla has zero competition and anyone who thinks they do knows nothing about the EV space.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 21:32:43'] same thing that happened when he said it was undervalued, or anything else he says on Twitter. short drop then, for some reason, it skyrockets. although this time, he's actually creating selling pressure.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 22:45:43'] Sooner or later he had to do it - either that or take a loan against the shares.The poll on. Twitter is just an attempt to mobilize his followers ( cult) in the battle against taxes and particularly billionaires taxes.He should pay taxes. Stock price possible hits ( especially short terms) is not a reason not to. The market takes care of price discovery independently. That said I suppose the sell will be a executed in tranches over time. Would be irresponsible to do it in one go.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 23:50:01'] Where can we find result of the polls?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 02:44:03'] I don't know how deep a liquidity in US stocks darkpools are, especially for TSLA, but there is a non-zero probability that he is going to sell its aforementioned stocks share through darkpools and this case can avoid stock price change, or it will be small. Also he could already have subscribed buyers for private direct sell or to form such darkpool with demand/liquidity to buy all stocks at once.It also could be a nothing-burger at the end, the same as "funding secured". Because if he dumps 10% directly in market hours, like in 10-15 minutes and even chunks of stocks, it will a) significantly drops the stock's price and b) big funds will have serious questions to him, or even lawsuits for stock market manipulation. In the last case, a mention about voting pool and lack of self-interest will have no effect as a proof in court or dealing with SEC (but the latter one is completely apathic in cases about Tesla and Musk-related business).
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 04:00:53'] Nothing will happen
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 04:47:09'] I think he may use a dark pool to sell so the price isn‚Äôt disrupted. Most large blocks will run through a dark pool so when they sell, they can get the same price for all the shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-07 06:55:40'] IN my opinion there are only two options:- he really is going to sell his shares - he is just misleading the shortsellers, and making a lot of noise around him, which will just obviously the stock will rise more

It's taking more share of advertising dollars as more ad spent shifts to streaming TV away from linear TV + there is extra upside from mobile ads based on Apple's digital privacy changes. When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear.

On one hand you have a valuation absolutely miles high of what it should be, competition 3-5 years from producing their EVs, and waning tax subsidy boosts. On the other hand you have the dominant player in EVs, battery tech, and automated driving. They‚Äôre delivering more cars, upping their production capabilities, and still years ahead of competitors. Literally you can‚Äôt make a wrong call. There are plausible reasons to invest and not invest in Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 17:09:15'] Amazon, i like how many different potential avenues for growth they have.- cloud- e commerce - advertising - kuiper- just walk and go tech- AI - automation- health. - entertainment Currently 3 of those are growing nicely (cloud, e-commerce, ad) with entertainment also growing and feeding back into the ad/ e-commerce business. The other fields are trillion dollar industries each (except satellite internet I believe) and amazon has a good shot of nailing a few of those and that‚Äôs all they would need. As an investor amazon has the potential to print so much free cash flow by end of this decade alone that it‚Äôs worth jumping in now, it‚Äôs a risk but better odds then most risks imo.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 00:21:53'] Weird as this may sound I tend to bounce back to Ford on a fairly regular basis. Share price is low enough that I can actually get 100 shares easily and then sell a covered call on that. If you are willing to sell a long dated contract you can do fairly well on the premium collected. Just as an example Jan 2024 $15 strike price for .87 per share. Price currently 12.74 and dividend is .15 per quarter. So 3 dividends for .45 plus the  .87 premium is over a 10% gain right there. Tack on if the call is actually exercised and you are look at another 2.26 per share all in less than a year. That isnt something to sneeze at.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 18:20:40'] Lately it is $AMR. They are a US-based producer of metallurgical (abbreviated 'met') coal that exports to over 25 countries. Met coal is a key input used for steel production--don't get confused with thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity and whose use is generally more controversial.The company is highly undervalued, even for a cyclical coal mining company. It is in the process of reducing its share count by about 30%. To quote some statistics from mid-March: "It has a market cap of 2.6B and has 300M in net cash. Its 2022 FCF was $1.3B. They have $1.2B remaining in share buybacks authorized, having already done $560M in buybacks since first authorization (beginning 2022 I believe). I'm seeing FCF/EV yields of 30-40%." [Read that once more: it generated half its entire market cap in FCF last year]It's roughly fairly priced if met coal prices were at $200 a ton, which is the average from 2010-2020. However, actual met prices are currently much higher thanks to surging demand from India/China, as well as bullish sentiment about steel usage in the US thanks to recent fiscal stimulus. [By contrast, thermal coal prices have less of a runway ahead of them barring a terribly cold winter in 2023/4]. We can't replace met coal just yet to produce steel, unlike thermal coal for power generation. Thermal coal can be phased out provided we make the right investments in nuclear/solar/wind/geothermal/hydro/natural gas/crude oil/..., all of which are better for the environment than thermal coal. I believe scientists are still experimenting ways to find cleaner ways of producing steel, like using hydrogen or other new materials. But that's a few decades away.2023 hasn't posed much of a slowdown at all for AMR, and it locks in contracts at great prices well in advance. Management has made clear they have *no* plans of expansion or M&A and are focused on share buybacks.I own shares at $153 a share, and it's roughly 1.5% of my portfolio (and will likely become close to 2%). I've been slowly buying in since January of this year.A similar company to AMR is ARCH, which is also met coal + thermal coal, or CEIX. (BTU is another company I'm excited about but it's a much riskier play than AMR. I'm equally bullish on AMR/BTU and can say more if people want)

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 16:07:21'] American Sports and Outdoors ASO - because I dumped a pile of cash on it last May 2022 and have some ~150% gains already. And this thing even spits out dividends. The market panic of an expected recession by the end of 2022 and it's main competitor Dicks Sporting Goods DKS lowering guidance crushed the stock bringing its forward PE down to 3X and PS to .25 or something. I mean, the valuation was totally crushed at that time bringing the market cap to just ~1B or something and even if expected sales and profit was going to be low, you could still give it a forward guidance of 4x or 5x as historical PE in the sector is between 9 &14. I was pumped to buy it with a margin of safety and just hold it forever and buy every dip and waiting for the recovery. The way the stock acted since then is like "what recession?".Edit: Academy not American

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 09:39:46'] >That said, I assumed in the 2013 valuation that, by 2021, Tesla's growth would be plateauing, and the company would be moving towards being a profitable, luxury car company.> Instead, the company seems to be just getting started, redefining itself as a mass market company, with much bigger ambitions.I‚Äôm not sure how anyone who had listened to Elon could have thought he was building a profitable, luxury car company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 09:17:16'] The world's best valuation model couldn't predict in 2011 when Steve Jobs died, AAPL would increase to 3 trillion dollar market cap from 300 billion. Anyone who told you AAPL would go up 1000% in 10 years would be laughed on as an idiot. And despite Apple's most innovate product in the last decade is wireless headset, AAPL managed to 10x. The best model also couldn't predict Amazon to be over 1.5 trillion and Googl over 2 trillion market cap. Valuation model works great on static and stable companies. They can't and won't be able to predict the true disruptors.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:07:55'] $414 billion in 2032 is a bit of a joke. Even if my worst case scenario Tesla is doing $350B in 2030, and that's with just 7.5M car sales compared to their target of 20M.16% operating margin is also a bit of a joke. That's only 2% higher than their current operating margin while they're not leveraging any of their economies of scale yet. Single piece casting has just started on a low scale in China, and both of their new factories in Berlin and Austin will produce more cars per year than their two current factories combined in due time. It's ridiculous to assume they will only increase their operating margins from 14% to 16% with all that. And then we're not even talking about their ever increasing software sales.So while I'm absolutely sure this guy knows his shit from a finance perspective, he's letting reasoning by analogy cloud his view on what Tesla will be doing in the future. "Other companies can't do it so neither can Tesla" is the easiest way to get to a faulty conclusion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-15 17:47:29'] It all depends on p/e ratio. It's common for a stock that grows as quickly as Tesla to trade over 100 p/e ratio. Tesla will likely do $15 eps in 2022. 15√ó100=$1500. This is my target for 2022. Anybody who is skeptical about Tesla achieving $15 eps in 2022 hasn't been paying attention.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 09:58:46'] Construction and manufacturing employment is a major driver of recessions in the US economy, and jobs losses prior to a recession almost always start in construction and manufacturing, not in services. So far, we have seen a lot of layoff announcements in tech (Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc.) but not in construction and manufacturing, which is where we normally see it prior to a recession. Why is this time different?Well, as interest rates rise, less people want to take out huge loans to buy new houses. As less people want to buy new houses, less building permits are applied for to build new houses. As less building permits are applied for, new units under construction then start to fall. As new units under construction starts to fall, you see U.S. construction and manufacturing payrolls start to fall and an increase in unemployment in the cyclical economy, which leads to a recession. Historically, looking at past recessions, job losses in the cyclical economy almost always pre-empt the recession. Again, why not this time?Well, if you look at the graphs, building permits peaked in late 2021 and started falling with rising interest rates. New units under construction typically lag building permits by several months, as such, new units under construction peaked in October 2022 and started to decline. US manufacturing payrolls then started to decline after October 2022 as well. So why have we not seen an uptick in unemployment in the cyclical economy as of yet?Well, we just had a once in a century global pandemic, and a lot of pre-planned construction during that time had to get delayed. As such, we recently had a small uptick in building permits in January 2023, which coincidentally resulted in a minor uptick in units under construction in March 2023, which resulted in an uptick in manufacturing payrolls.But guess what, building permits has once again started to go down again as of February 2023 and I believe with interest rates set to remain above 5% for the foreseeable future, we have hit a clear peak in building permit applications and the broad national momentum remains to the downside. This will result in further degradation in new units under construction moving forward, and increased job losses in the cyclical economy, which has nearly always historically pre-empted a recession.I do not believe the fed is taking these lags in their data into account properly. The fed cannot control the lags, they can only control interest rates and continue to raise interest rates higher and higher until they see a crack in services employment. This does not make any sense though because unemployment in the services sector rarely ever pre-empts a recession.I believe, based off looking at the data, the fed should have stopped increasing rates awhile ago and waited for these lag effects to play out. In my opinion, in the coming months, the cyclical economy is going to get hit hard with job losses in the construction and manufacturing industry which will inevitably result in a recession later this year.I know this is completely 100% against current reddit sentiment and that most people believe we are just going to trot merrily off into the next major bull market with SPY at 5000 by EOY.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 05:16:27'] An interesting excerpt from Bloomberg about how narrow this rally has been in recent historical terms: Of the nine meaningful drawdowns since 1995, the average percentage of Russell 3000¬†stocks trading above their 200-day moving average¬†at the 150-day mark post the bottom was 70% (min 56%, max 88%). As of the 150-day mark following the Oct. ‚Äô22 low, it was just 36%. In other words, if we're in a new bull- it would be by far the weakest breadth this far off a major bottom of any new uptrend over the last ~30 years.Consolidation and efficiency chasing are what the market is betting on.

It costs $66 less to get copper delivered in two days (spot price) as opposed to in 3 months. It reflects a smaller desire to buy copper right now, and that buyers are less desperate to get copper into storage. [If the 2 day and 3 month price was the same, investors are indifferent to buying it now and storing it for 3 months or just buying it in 3 months; if the anticipated need for copper starts to fall or storages are sufficient, then investors demand a discount to hold even more in storage]- Chinese [inventories fall](https://i.imgur.com/LhxaqKw.png) as Western ones rise, indicating relative weakness in Western demand. Still, Chinese demand has been much weaker than predicted.This is all a short-term story, of course: [here is a post of mine with the longer term bull case](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1288qre/copper_investors_are_demonstrating_the_bystander/), though slightly out of date. I'll give a small sample of the key graphs:- [Global mining capex extremely muted](https://i.imgur.com/vHaQpT8.png) relative to earnings (Mining.com)- [Record low base metal inventories, including copper.](https://i.imgur.com/lGLE1Xl.png) (Goehring & Rozencwajg)- [Copper shortages might even be imminent](https://i.imgur.com/XsY4Ucr.png) (FT)- [Fewer copper mining discoveries are being made](https://i.imgur.com/KEEb7WE.png)- [Bringing mines online is an arduous process](https://i.imgur.com/S3kcXqC.png) (S&P Global)- [Chile, one of the biggest producers, seeing production at lowest level in 6 years](https://i.imgur.com/diZAhqN.png). (Bloomberg) Chile represents "a quarter of the world's mined copper."Markets have been anticipating a possible near term glut, but the medium/long term story is unchanged: it's hard to get miners to dig more, and the substitutes (aluminum) have their own issues. What can happen when inventories draw down so much?> In 2006 exchange inventories fell to briefly 1 mm tonnes, and when adjusted by days of consump- tion, inventories had fallen to less than five days of consumption‚Äîthe lowest levels since 1990. And just like in the late 1980s, base metals prices experienced a massive surge. From the end of 2004 to the beginning of 2006, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc prices surged between 300% and 400%.For context: in mid-January of this year, "The London Metal Exchange's (LME) global warehouse network held 654,345 tonnes of metal at the end of December, less than half the tonnage registered at the close of 2021". Another source I found says today's total base metals inventory for the LME is 768K. Reuters: "Total registered stocks in the ShFE warehouse network stood at 228,797 tonnes at the end of December" (LME + Shanghai Exchange are the two key sources of inventory)Right now, commodities are the real contrarian trade in my view. The outlook in the near term is very bearish, until suddenly it won't be.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 11:41:57'] I really don't know about the whole "they will get competitors" line. The other auto manufacturers have had 6 years to come up with a meaningful competitor to the model 3, and the closest they've got are the Chevy Bolt (sucks) and Porsche Taycan (way too expensive). If that's the best the competitors have managed to do in 6 years, I'm starting to give up on them. As long as Tesla doesn't drop the ball, by the time the other competitors "catch up", Tesla should be comfortably another 10 years ahead of them.I know making cars is hard. I know it's a tough industry. I get it, but my god, the innovation in the industry outside of Tesla for the past 20 years has been a pitiful joke.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-21 15:09:57'] Everyone that uses an ICE car a lot can afford an EV as the insane reduction in running and maintenance costs make up for the monthly cost of the car.Tesla's competition are also irrelevant. They're already worth more than other car manufacturers combined despite being outsold by many of them individually. Given that there's no reason to believe that sentiment should change in the future. Tesla's value is based purely on its historic value. It will be $1000 a share again purely because it has been before. Bullish and bearish news will affect sentiment but there's no reason to believe it's market cap will ever reflect it's finances. Tesla's is a cult and swing trading stock. Its financial fundamentals and that of it's competitors are completely irrelevant at any given moment.

POST_TEXT: b'Hi Reddit!\n\nI\'ve (30M) been stressed about my father\'s retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock.

He\'s convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn\'t really reacted to the bearish arguments I\'ve laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:41:33'] When the options are all bad, people tend to choose the extreme gamble.As you have mentioned: "your father is behind on his retirement plan". From his perspective, the option looks like: 1. Gamble with Tesla and you may 4x/10x and have enough for retirement2. Or he can continue with lesser risky investment ~10%  per annum however it *will still be not enough* for his retirementInstead of trying to explain about option 1 downside, which I believe he should know it is risky but still think it is better than option 2, you should try to think and propose option 3.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 07:50:16'] It is a massive gamble to have 100% of your life savings in a single stock. It could all go to zero. If he doesn‚Äôt believe that, show him examples of any number of single companies who were former giants who went under, or whose stock significantly depreciated and has never recovered.A diversified portfolio of stock and bond funds is what every advisor with a pulse recommends for a reason.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 16:49:06'] Obviously the standard answer is index funds, with some bonds at his age, and keeping everything in one stock is crazy. But here are some other things to think about.- If he's behind on his retirement funding, then that's probably not going to work out for him. Various measures of market valuation still say the overall market is valued pretty highly, and companies like Vanguard are projecting low returns over the next decade. Depending on how far behind he is, that might not be viable.- Volatile stocks are horrible for people prone to buying high and selling low, but apparently your dad has the cojones to hold on for the long term. TSLA still has to do well but at least he'll reap the benefits if it does.- TSLA's prospects don't entirely depend on self-driving. Watch the recent Investors Day presentation, most of it was about radically reducing costs while increasing quality and scale. Also check out Sandy Munro's videos, he's an engineer who consults with automobile manufacturers. He's famous for taking apart an early Model 3 and heavily criticizing it; now he raves about how far Tesla is ahead of other manufacturers. And it's not just the car business; they make as many battery cells as they can and sell the extras to power grids. They're even starting up their own lithium refinery.- Finally, if you talk him out of his TSLA and TSLA goes to the moon then he's going to blame you for keeping him poor, move in with you, and complain about might-have-beens every day.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 12:34:07'] You're crying about your dad all inning a top 10 company in the s&p in the age of ai and electric vehicles? Even buffet is 40% apple, and averaged up close to ATH at 160's earlier after regretting his 120 sells. This interest rate envrionment will further bankrupt their competition and cause steeper monopolization than ever before.By kelly criterion if he thinks there's a 90% chance tsla doubles from here (previous ATH) that's about 85% he should be invested in. That goes to 92.5% invested if he has 95% confidence.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:16:29'] Well for one, I would show him how it‚Äôs already made it‚Äôs 1000% move and has already had multiple stock splits since then which just increases the difficulty for it to do that again. And then the current P/E ratio is in the 40s so let‚Äôs low ball the expectation at 5x today for the next 10ish years. That would mean that Tesla would be nearly a 3T dollar company while also maintaining expectations of high growth to justify the high PE or massive profits and while adding 2.5T dollars into buying the stock. In other words in the next decade it will have to add the entire worth of apple on top of what‚Äôs already in it. The practicality alone would make me not bank on it happening, but then you got the troubles brewing with China relations, and all the boomers retiring with their capital fleeing from risky bets, and the increase competition, amongst the 10 other more speculative possible issues that I won‚Äôt get into. I haven‚Äôt looked into Teslas financials lately but you could def attempt a discounted cash flow or look at bullish projections of earnings and reverse engineer stock price based on if it maintains the PE or whatever. But while I wouldn‚Äôt tell him to not invest in Tesla, I definitely would tell him to diversify most of it. Oh also if he averaged up from 130$ it looks like he‚Äôs close to break even if not down, but either way just show the math on how quickly it could fall apart if the rug is pulled like a China factory close or calculate what happens when Elon has to use all his billions on Twitter and has to borrow with Tesla at these higher rates when they Barely escaped bankruptcy at low rates.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 09:42:19'] I know people at my work who did this and were able to get over $1M in retirement savings before they turned 40. It's a huge gamble but investing in Tesla over the last 10 years had been an incredible return for them

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 08:24:32'] This makes me gladder that I did something similar at 30. I lost tens of thousands after I had grand dreams of my windfall supporting me to start a real estate venture. I‚Äôll recover and at worst, work one additional year and not retire as early, and I won‚Äôt ever make the mistake of putting more than a tiny amount of my money into any single stock. If I hadn‚Äôt learned that lesson now, I might have tried that at 58, and never been able to retire.Your father needs to get out of his position immediately, this is unbelievably risky. There is always a tiny, tiny chance that he does ok and gets a big gain, but if he does, I guarantee that he lets it ride and loses later, or he tries to replicate his luck and loses later. No way he wins in the end.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 10:19:05'] If he plans to hold on until 2030 he will most likely be totally fine. This year is going to be maximum volatility for the immediate future. It's still incredibly risky at his age though. I rolled over my 401k in 2020 and went heavy into Tesla before the S&P inclusion and still had cash available when they announced the inclusion. Due to that I doubled it instead of just buying index funds since index funds had to buy Tesla. I was up over 250% in about a year, but due to my strategy of not trying to time the market, I went lower than my original investment once it dropped. It's now back above that, but it may be a rough year for Tesla meeting the growth targets. The current bear market has hit growth stocks hard. If we get out of the recession, than Tesla will easily rise above it's previous all time high if they keep growth and profitability in line. It's definitely no certain outcome, but their ambitions are sky high and with the vertical integration and extremely low debt overall, they have huge potential for growth this decade. Grid scale energy storage having endless growth potential, a Tesla compact vehicle, mass production of batteries internally, robotaxis and robotics are all in work for the decade which some of those projects could easily push Tesla into the multi trillion dollar range. Really, Elon has been the main issue lately for Tesla headwinds, but he was the guy who directed ship to the current valuation.

This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.OMG, your dad perfectly made it and he would have been multi-millionaires north of 100M+ by now.Pre-split I was holding 3875 stocks of TSLA(and also 275 options), but sold when it was $275 (poor decision), while my friend was holding tight his 3350 shares which he now owns $17M.No need to diversify as TSLA has longer potential to grow further even though it has short term volatility due to market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 13:47:00'] You are thinking about this correctly. It's risky as hell.I made really good gains betting on Tesla prior to the pandemic. It became a pretty big part of my portfolio but it didn't start that way. Gains got it there. When the pandemic hit I got out, thinking the economy was going to crash. I delayed getting back in when it was clear that it wasn't, because Musk started acting very erratic (or showing his true self) turning off his primary customer base. The cars were getting more and more expensive and the promise of fully self-driving cars and robotaxis seemed further and further away. I'm back in to some degree because I see some positives in where Tesla is heading now (except the self-driving progress is still unclear) but I'm cautious. I'm in my 50's and I believe in preserving the gains I have and trying to grow them in a balanced way, not being overly aggressive.Tesla has a lot of strengths and advantages in their market, but there is also a shitton of risk. Musk is one of them. Everything relies on him and he is a loose cannon. What if something happens to him tomorrow? The competing car companies are working hard to catch up. Even if everything goes well, their PE does not nearly justify the stock price. They have a long way to go to make that equation work. Your dad may be right that the stock will shoot up dramatically over the next 3-5 years. Then again, it may not. Who knows? It's a bet, like any other bet. Bets like this should be hedged. Being really greedy tends to bite you in the ass. I used to work with a guy that was past retirement age but had to still work full time. This was after selling a company he owned. In his case it was because he lost everything to Bernie Madoff. He made a bet and it completely failed. I felt bad for him.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 09:30:09'] The hard truth is that it‚Äôs his money and he can invest however he wants with it. Personally, I‚Äôm not a fan of Tesla as a company nor am I a fan of Elon. That aside, I would recommend reviewing the company financials (10-K and 10-Q for example), the company leadership, their ‚Äúmoats‚Äù, risks, and their long term strategy amongst other things. I would then recommend he do his own financial analysis looking at free cash flow over his time horizon. If your dad has done this and understands what he‚Äôs reading and is still on board for Tesla, then so be it. But what you as an individual need to do is to understand how his decisions impact you. You then need to understand what his worst case scenario is and determine what your boundaries are. If the stock crashes and he cannot live off Tesla, are you going to support him? Provide him housing? Elderly care? Pay his bills? Call me heartless but I would not if my parents invested like this without a backup assets to generate cash flow in retirement.  Either way, you need to set your boundaries and expectations with your father. He may be relying on you as his fall back. On the flip side, investing in just one company is not inherently bad. If you understand the risks and the company then you can probably get away with it. But, you really really need to understand the business, it‚Äôs leadership, risks, the competition, the industry, and all the other ins and outs.

He is 58 and so must have been through some ups and downs in his life to know what you are worrying about. So, I don't think he needs a convo with you about his investment choice.

I'd say he really needs to switch it back to a target date (a later target date now, unfortunately). He can and should take advantage of the increased contribution allotment (because of his age). Tell him to hit it hard and hope for the best, because he most likely just pissed away an awful lot of retirement savings.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 10:14:02'] He clearly likes Tesla. I think your best play here is to bring up the benefits of a etf to him that is heavily weighted in Tesla stock and offers some diversification. An actively managed ETF would do the rebalancing for him so as to not incur charges for buying and selling Tesla, he could even combine this with periods of tax loss harvesting to claim additional $ thereby maximising his upside potential.

He can run them 20-25% above the current stock price and make 25% per year on monthlies. If nothing else it will lower his cost basis on it.I personally agree with his assessment that it's a good long term hold. Don't let the near term fluctuations dissuade you from seeing what their disruptions to the market will do in 5-10 years.

But usually you have to start from basics and people don‚Äôt always have the attention span for that. Nobel prize winning economist and professor emeritus at Yale (if you need bonafides and authority to prove a point to your parent) has a free course at coursera which is pretty good. I think first few modules give you some nice history and some basic math around diversification. https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-globalIt is worth mentioning that diversification is more about wealth management and not necessarily about becoming wealthy, so risk management  might not resonate if they feel like they need to make up for lagging wealth with risk/reward trade offs.

That said, maybe introducing him to the stability of some ETFs might help him at least direct some future cash in another direction. Sell it as insurance and maybe pointing out that "If Tesla comes in, you already have enough in there to retire." If not maybe the insurance of a diversified ETF can make sure they don't struggle in retirement.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 13:33:25'] TBH, much of the rest of the market looks almost as skanky as Tesla right now, and tech/growth is overvalued again. The broad market indexes will probably tank sometime after April 15. I wouldn't advise him to buy other stocks.He might want to buy gold, or gold shares like SGOL. Gold generally considered a safe haven asset and Central banks have been ramping up buying gold since the NATO countries seized Russia's sovereign wealth funds. 2023 is looking like another gold buying year as governments try to diversify out of the dollar, as its reserve currency appeal erodes due to sanctions and seizures. The nice thing about qualified retirement funds is that you don't pay the ridiculous precious metals tax when you have gains in a 401K fund. Also there are treasuries & munis that are paying 5-6% now, I believe.He should definitely sell chunks of Tesla stock and buy at least some safe haven stuff like gold and high interest treasuries & munis.

Since inception, TSLA has enjoyed the euphoria phase: the only all EV manufacturer, Musk fanboys, and promises of FSD and so on.  There was a shared vision that TSLA would take over all autos, all personal transport, and everything involving electricity.  Essentially, a new age for man.Today, TSLA is reverting to the mean and being evaluated like normal stocks.  It still has value and potential, but the shine is wearing thin.  Look at Master Plan 3, it's totally lame.  To me TWTR is a huge problem.  Musk is under a huge amount of stress and unlike the Solar City acquisition, Musk won't be able to brush it under the success of TSLA.  So, with all that said, I don't think you should stress about your dad.  He's a grown ass man.  Maybe he will 10x his money, maybe he'll lose 50%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:15:12'] "Dad, if this stock goes under, what are you going to do for retirement? Are you planning to rely on me to financially support you or do you have another way to pay your bills?"Let him know how this will affect you in the event that he loses everything and you have to take care of him. Even if you don't have any intention to financially support him, forcing him to commit to a worst-case retirement plan out loud might give him pause. Assuming that he's a good parent, he may only be thinking of the consequences of his actions in terms of how they affect him, and if he thinks that you're going to be burdened with taking care of him in the event that his gamble doesn't pay off he might reconsider.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:20:56'] Fortunately TSLA is the lead in the EV industry and your father has seen how gas efficient cars became big the last century. Wisdom does come with age. May be onto something. But 100% in is risky. Still think the odds of payoff are higher than loss over time. And therein is the question, does he have enough time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:22:17'] He may have made the right choice!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:22:37'] Unfortunately this is more common than you think. And most of the time this behavior is coming from a normally functioning adult, who tends to act rationally about anything else. I've heard this story n number of times either from a friend or a friend of a friend and whether its $TSLA or $NVDA, the rationale tends to be the same. "I'm financially behind my peers, I need to take on bigger risk to compensate."What's even more unfortunate is that these are the people (especially in his life stage) who've probably been fiscally responsible up until this point. The funny thing about investing is that you only truly understand your risk tolerance once you've blown up. Most successful investors and traders advocate this as a necessary learning experience. In the case of your dad, I don't blame him if this is his situation but the fallout will be brutal. The only thing I can suggest is for him to reduce his overall exposure by selling half of his shares, and putting 10% into leaps. That way, if he's ultra-bullish he can capitalize on the upside.This is an extreme opinion, but if you're up for the challenge maybe this will change his mind.Your dad probably knows this, but tell him how in every bubble the vast majority of investors lose money. That's basically what makes it a bubble, right? If a lot of people didn't lose a lot of money than it wouldn't be a bubble. Conversely, there are always the few people who make it out with their shirts and they're most likely either 1. connected 2. rich 3. an expert (someone who was an industry expert before the bubble happened) 4. an institution, or 5. extremely lucky. Now ask your dad, is he any of these? No. He is exactly the prototype of the "retail" investor who loses their shirt from this bubble. It's not the well-connected VC folks who invested in $TSLA back in 2009. It's not the wealthy ultra high-net worth individuals who's money is managed by a family office. It's not the battery scientist who's been tinkering with EV technology since 2012. It's not BlackRock who sees and hears everything. And it's not the lucky guy who bought $TSLA in 2014 because he thought the cars looked cool.You can't just think of the wealth destruction of a bubble popping when $TSLA goes from $400 to $100. Look at the recent reports, the amount of $$$ retail is plowing directly into $TSLA the past 3 months is staggering. THESE are the "chumps" who become the bag-holders. The true wealth destruction is when $TSLA goes from $100 to $200, sucks in as many retail investors as it can so the folks from #1 - #5 can offload their positions, then goes down to $50. Right now is exactly when retail is left holding the bag. There's a really good reason why most bubble charts look the same. Whether it's $TSLA, $CSCO back in the dot-com bubble, Bitcoin, or the Dutch East India in the 1700s. At the end of the day, speculation and bubbles are driven by human greed that never changes. What also never changes is that that only the minority end up winning big (category #1-#5) and they're the ones cashing out during the initial plunge and the initial bull trap recovery. It's always the normal investors who missed out on the initial gravy train that jump in too late with eager eyes and end up getting hurt the most.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:23:26'] Your dad is a smart guy
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:32:21'] I wouldn't approach this from an investment advice standpoint, but from a "what's your plan for retirement/life if TSLA dips significantly" standpoint. Because that's, as a child, really the only place you're involved. If TSLA does something stupid and the stock goes significantly down to 2020 levels, is your dad planning to move in with you? Live off his social security?  Work until he keels over and dies? Investing all your retirement savings in *any* single stock is a huge gamble.  And if he ends up losing it all and relying on his kids for financial support in his retirement and old age, that becomes a gamble he's taking with your life, not his.  Be kind, but frame this as a future planning for your family's happiness conversation, not a "is TSLA a good stock" conversation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 15:32:37'] Ask him - What happens to TSLA if something happens to Elon Musk?  Not wishing bad on anyone, but people with more protection have been assassinated before, for example.    There is the normal human death risk too, but Elon is such a polarizing figure nowadays that I‚Äôm sure the risk that something happens to him outsizes the risk to a normal person of his age.    Your dad is betting his entire life savings on 1 man‚Äôs success, health, ability to stay alive, etc.

If he‚Äôs already behind, look at his options as far as he‚Äôs concerned.1: Fuck it, we ball. Five to one odds against, but he could get lucky and find himself with enough to retire. Or not, and he find himself without enough to retire.2: Do the safe, sensible thing and invest in a target date fund. Everything goes perfectly, and he *still* doesn‚Äôt have enough for retirement. Why would you play a game you‚Äôre certain to lose, when you could play one you might win? I know it‚Äôs a logical fallacy, because the two aren‚Äôt equivalent, but they sure as hell look like it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 09:37:49'] Tesla is not SpaceX. The two are distinct. They only happen to have the same CEO.Currently automotive is by far the biggest money maker wrt Tesla. The other business lines do play a part in the valuation but currently only a very small one. That may change (personally I think energy will eventually rival automotive when it comes to revenue). So to qiualify your initial statement: No. Tesla is not a car company. Even if you were to reduce it to the automotive business line its approach to delivering mobility products is so much different than what legacy car companies do that it's misleading to apply the same term.SpaceX will not be public. The aim for SpaceX is to get to Mars. This is not a profit oriented venture. Going public would eliminate the possibility of reaching that goal as investors want to see return on investments and would force SpaceX to abandon this in favor of more mundane operations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 07:26:21'] The answer is sort of. SpaceX is completely and likely always will be completely privately owned. That is musk's baby, he wants no one having authority of any kind outside of the company. So that one is a no. However to answer the rest of your question, the reason Tesla is worth more than any other automotive company is because they are not an automotive company. They are a convenience based electronic powerhouse. The solar products, the battery back ups, starlink(a future ipo for starlink is possible but unlikely until mass saturation) and the merchandise are  all part of the business, however just like the cars, they are not the true value in the business. Tesla is first and foremost a technology company (think apple Microsoft or google) who specialize in their own hardware(much like apple) due to their need to control the parameters of those pieces (much like apple). Personally I do think they are worth more than their valuation. I'd say they are currently about 30% overweight and within the next 5 years could easily see their valuation double again as they continue to evolve and expand.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:02:40'] $TSLA is more established but $PLTR has more room to grow.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:00:11'] 1 year flip a coin. 5 years PLTR. 10 years both. Tesla? Id wait for robotaxis...EVs will pop up like wild mushrooms so the head start there is already priced in. Pltr? Id wait for it to be the go-to "enterprise OS" and the market to realize that it WILL be the enterprise go-to OS.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 00:19:42'] PLTR has more growth potential from current levels.  TSLA needs world of Robotaxis for exponential growth to continue.  PLTR just needs to keep doing what they are doing and time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:05:22'] PLTR, I‚Äôll take the smaller company.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:46:06'] I think PLTR has more upside
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 09:03:54'] PLTR. Lots of competition for TSLA in the next 2 years from every other automaker.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:16:54'] PLTR.Good luck seeing any significant growth on an 800B MC company lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:55:20'] Own both. Holding for a decade.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:01:41'] I own 2 Tesla's (s and y). Great cars, great company, insane valuation that is totally indefensible. Tesla needs everything to go right and then some to justify their current valuation which is greater than the rest of the car companies in the world -combined-.Pltr on the other hand is richly valued but has plenty of room to grow.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 04:58:51'] Pltr because Tesla is soo overvalued
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 05:20:52'] PLTR - lower barrier to entry and much more room to grow
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:29:53'] Elon hasnt sold his shares
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 08:06:07'] Pltr. They are forming long term customers with big contracts, and the military still believes there is literally no other company or product that does what palantir can do. Way better moat and amazing sales growth that can be sustained, as software is a reliable well scaling business model.And smaller market cap.  A 50 B software company like pltr can easily grow to 300 B without even becoming a top ten software company.  So a 6x increase isn't that crazy over a reasonable time line.  Tesla is 800 B, for them to double once would make them more valuable than Nvidia, and on the same level as Microsoft, amazon and apple. The actual biggest producer of cars right now is worth less than 300 B, by contrast. If tsla were priced better, I'd say it's a tough call, but they're not. Tesla fan boys are in here talking like scaling a car company is like Apple.  That's idiotic. Supply chains get harder, and managing repeat annual sales and high quality is very hard.  Every single large car company could produce more than they do, but they limit production to manage sales (excluding the current chip shortage). In fact, tesla is still small enough they can manage a chip shortage.  They wouldn't be able to do that if they were building 1 million cars this quarter, like their major competitors. And there might be a natural limit to how many cars are demanded from a single label. Nobody makes more than 6-7 million cars per year. Once there are so many on the road, consumers get bored and want something different. They are also fighting brand loyalty. They are a lot of Mercedes benz drivers that might be in a tsla now that will switch back when they can. In a few years, tesla will no longer command novelty. Lastly, the used market. This is the first year tsla will make over 1 million cars. The thing about big growth is that the demand for teslas are being met by new production right now.  In about 3 years, there will be a million used teslas on the market. Which means a large part of tesla demand can be fulfilled in the market without tsla making money. That doesn't really exist right now, with only thousands of used vehicles available now. This is why car companies like Toyota have to carefully plan and limit how much they produce, they know if 10 million people are buying Toyota this year,  half of them are buying used.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 09:20:28'] TSLA by a country mile
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:49:25'] Pltr
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:21:59'] Pltr
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:39:49'] PLTR because I can see more upside, less competition, and I don't see them running into as many technical bottlenecks as TSLA. It's a software solution that so far has proven to work at scale. Their issue is making money, but their product and their ability to deliver it, as far as I know, has not been brought into question. TSLA relies far too much on Elon Musk's quasi personnality cult for my taste. He has been a successful trailblazer in some ways, but he's also got a track record of making many pie-in-the-sky promises and predictions that fall completely flat. As a CEO he's somewhat erratic, and I could see him crashing and burning, taking the company and stock down with him. Not only that but TSLA's products are far more complex and difficult to deliver, there are just a lot more ways that projects can be delayed and fall apart.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:31:11'] As much as fanboys will say TSLA is still a buy, its valuation is way harder to justify than PLTR's. I think PLTR's valuation is very fair, and as Warren Buffett says: it's better to buy a great company at a fair price than a fair company at a great price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 02:14:30'] Easily Tesla, it's a lot safer and easier to understand. Any idiot (like myself) can take Tesla's sales targets, multiply that by monthly FSD price multiplied by your estimated takerate and find out how Tesla will be worth somewhere between $5T and $15T by 2030 if they do solve autonomous driving. If they don't, their automotive and solar/energy storage alone should already be somewhere between $2T and $3T by that time. It's a safe bet.Palantir on the other hand is a lot more speculative and endlessly more difficult to understand. If you're really knowledgeable about data analytics and software, I imagine it's possible to analyse the company's potential and recognize big opportunity, but for 99% of retail investors it's too complex and would be simply a gamble instead of an investment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 04:30:41'] PLTR is less like to get the straps placed on it be the SEC.  But, I wouldnt short TSLA either.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 04:48:20'] Long term, PLTR could conceivably double from $23 to $46, and we know this because it already did, earlier this year.But how it could actually earn its way there would be to continue landing captive subscription clients (top line) and somehow fixing their habit of spending every dollar they bring in.  If they somehow get spend and compensation hemorrhage to stop, their multiple fixes itself and the stock can justify $40+.  I'm reminded of when Amazon used to spend every dollar and pundits said the stock will never move because of P/E.  When E started moving, P was happy to go parabolic.Short term?  TSLA has some good sentiment coming its way.  Pundits seem to have forgotten who/what Musk is, and they're back to santiizing and normalizing him and building him up to be some "genius".  That plus some imminent news headline wins with factories opening and EV adoption getting hyped and all the rest means TSLA could certainly go up 25% before PLTR can.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 04:59:07'] I would not buy PLTR if YOU paid ME.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 07:21:39'] Wouldn't touch TSLA.  Ridiculously overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 07:25:10'] Absolutely positively TESLA. They innovate and execute. Tesla‚Äôs 1 year time horizon is tremendous with the opening of their plant in Germany and the production of their pickup truck. They continue to develop semi tractor trailers and will probably license software to achieve self driving cars. PLTR is extraordinarily challenging in actually integrate their product into new customers. It takes a significant commitment of personnel that is highly trained. I see their biggest issue being staffing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 08:30:38'] TSLA all day long.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 10:20:11'] AMRS.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 12:44:51'] PLTR for sure, for long run 5 to 10 years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 14:21:01'] I would get out of stocks if i was ever in a situation to only choose between those two
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 17:06:32'] Why not split between both? That‚Äôs what I did. TSLA & PLTR are my main holdings. PLTR will be massive in time. TSLA has many avenues for the S curve. Right now is the EV adoption phase, but over a longer period of time, energy will likely be the main business. Also AI and robots can likely lead other massive TAM outside energy & EV.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:49:21'] There‚Äôs more growth potential with PLTR
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 17:53:05'] tesla for me because it‚Äôs a easier business to understand and i like the cars.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:14:13'] Tesla cause power.  Every house needs a battery.  Every house needs solar.  Every grid needs a mega pack.  Once those revenues kick it it‚Äôll be a windfall of revenue.  Batteries, robo taxis.  Innovation.  I cannot see a world in which they aren‚Äôt one of the most valuable companies.  If the stock takes a hit.  Buy more.  All of the biggest companies are energy and oil.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:57:07'] PLTR because they are growing. Tesla can be a car company all it wants but a car company doesn‚Äôt grow to 1 Trillion. Their solar has failed. I know they have other shit, but the solar and storage part of the business has been underwhelming tbh. I own shares of neither right now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:41:54'] TSLA by far
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:54:44'] TSLA - electric cars are here to stay. Tesla is currently ahead of the pack as far as battery life and the way Elon presents the cars. They're for a younger up and coming crowd that grew up with technology and TSLA embraces it fully. IMO it wouldn't hurt to own both. I know you want the ONE answer lol. Both have positive future outlooks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 20:11:36'] Realistically both can do very well. 1 year PLTR. Amount of contracts is great. They‚Äôre small money but they‚Äôre adding up. 5/10 Tesla. 5 because I‚Äôm predicting Tesla to simply outpace all other automakers for another 5 years. At this point, Tesla is pumping out cars while everyone else is attempting to catch up. Many startups with advanced tech will be bought up to aid the catch up, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll make a big difference. 10 years is Tesla solely because around that time we will have hit 1.5 degrees of warming in climate change. We are currently guaranteed 30 years of warming. We are also guaranteed to hit the 2.0 degrees if we hit 1.5 in sub 10 years. At that point in time I expect the world to hit the panic button. Panic button means massive tax credits and green industry investment. Tesla is very well positioned to benefit from such a catalyst with residential solar and more than likely shipping over 1.5 million cars a year by then.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:50:33'] I feel like a huge part of Tesla‚Äôs success has been their (relative) speed at which they have been producing electric cars. They got the jump on basically the entire electric car market, and it‚Äôs only just now that any of the mainstream manufacturers have been getting into it.I think Tesla will struggle to maintain even close to this much success as Ford releases their electric lineup in full production, let alone any of the other half a dozen major car companies. Look at the crazy amount of hype around the F-150 Lightning, pretty much overwhelming excitement over the Cybertruck. Now imagine the Cybertruck having to compete with the F-150 Lighting, the Electric Silverado, Electric Ram, Electric Tacoma, and Electric Hummer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:47:10'] You can easily find better companies to invest in than both of these.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:05:31'] Tesla because they will out produce all the car makers combined in EV manufacturing in the next couple of years
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 21:22:09'] TSLA for one thing, I don't really understand what Palantir does.I know what Tesla does. TSLA has strong branding, similar to Apple. Young people like them. Legacy car makers like Ford can't even field a competitive football team (Detroit Lions)
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 23:04:22'] PLTR. If there is a war they could easily become 10 times larger (or more).
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 00:43:43'] Economies of scale. Not familiar with PLTR but it obviously has better growth expectations
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 09:27:26'] TSLA obviously since pltr was a pump and dump and still a crap company with lots of pending litigation and cancelled contracts
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 21:20:03'] Can someone please explain me the upside for PLTR and why the have they have a 45B market cap. The balloon is gonna pop soon
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 20:22:01'] Long term tsla. Pltr always finds a way to go down. Also it's dependent on government which gives out contracts for lobbyists, so good luck thinking you are betting on the most competent company like it mattersEverybody wants a tsla in Europe, we barely have 1 ,  2 in a town where there are tons of bnw , audi, mercs, uruses, 100k cars.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 01:44:09'] If I HAD to, I'd pick PLTR, because there might be more upside, but no one has to put their money into overvalued company, so naturally, I'd look elsewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 02:12:28'] $TSLA hands down
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 03:14:00'] I see Tesla at $1100-1200 in less than one year, so, I would prefer the EV maker. For the 5-year and 10-year period, I estimate both to grow substantially, but my investments would be 60-40 in favour of Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 03:50:32'] These are literally the only 2 stocks I have in my long term
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-23 13:11:57'] PLTR could within 10+ years reach the price of $200It's being ignored to some extend by big whales. You can expect a lot of up / down and sideway trading.If they continue adding contracts year by year, the price will have some uptrend.It's actually waiting for large trigger point. I personally believe once they reach point they stop  loosing money and making ton of $ it will break and starts trading at more serious levels.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-09 10:59:41'] I would split my money between these two and the the safest if things go wrong with any company. I have 50% more in TSLA but I slowly try to increase my position on PLTR.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:57:09'] There‚Äôs no more notorious Tesla bears (they are all jumping to other EVs like Lucid) so TSLA will grow but do not expect any major jump from squeezing the bears. It‚Äôs a prime blue chip stock like Amazon. If they play their card right and the rumor Australia Giga Factory is true then they might as well go to $3K per share like most bullish prediction.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 18:38:32'] AMRS
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 19:48:50'] Both.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 00:11:44'] 1 year TESLA, 5 year Tesla, 10 year Tesla.  But if I were putting 10k into a stock and planning to let it sit... go with 90% Tesla 10% PLTR.  PLTR has some really interesting stuff and they could pop hard someday just like Tesla did last year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-11 01:50:21'] Both suck
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-10 21:00:22'] I guess it depends on the amount available to invest. If you have the 78k to get 100 shares of TSLA I would lean that route and sell weekly OTM covered calls. Or if you wanted a larger premium you could set some further out at a price you‚Äôd be happy having exercised. Just my 2¬¢. Musk and his shenanigans keep the volatility on TSLA higher than others most of the time so covered calls can generate good income‚Ä¶

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 08:43:24'] I don't think you realise just how insane those assumptions as well as your expected market cap are. Combine that with a P/E that essentially tells us that the market would still expect annual growth between 15 and 20% at that point. From a 7T company.As  for vehicle sales - you do realise that Teslas are luxury cars not accessible for a big chunk of the automobile market and that there are other carmakers as well, don't you? Just how many cars do you expect TSLA to sell annually?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 08:48:23'] Do you have any idea how hard it is for companies to grow at 50% annually when they are as big as Tesla will be in 3-4 years?  This sort of assumption is insane, and there's never been a company in the history of companies that has grown that quickly for that long at that size.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 09:31:48'] The only reason to buy TLSA right now is if you truly believe they will dominate the auto driving space. If you don't their current valuation is not attractive.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 10:22:05'] Something doesn't pass the sniff test. Tesla makes 1.5 million cars per year now. If we assume that they're increasing revenues by increasing the number of cars they sell, then that would mean they're making **34 million cars in 2032**.That's half of the total annual light vehicle production for the entire world.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 08:31:15'] Ford PE is under 5 and the F150 lightning hasn‚Äôt shipped yet. Not betting against TSLA, but I think there is bigger short term upside with F with a lower cost of entry and dividends too.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 10:57:20'] Im staying away from TLSA for now just because there are too many fanboys like this poster who blindly follow and buy in with very little due diligence, one small change and that sentiment could reverse very quickly and with it the valuation of the company. tldr; too much emotion investing into TLSA right now

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-02 10:23:33'] Keeping emotion and politics outside of my investment choices, I hold heavy stake in Tesla because I truly believe the vision Tesla is headed in the next 10 years. I don't predict a 500% increase, but I do see it grow steadily over time. You can't get a model y, x, or s delivered until January '23, and that's with all of the Tesla factories working almost back to 100%. How many million pre orders for the cybertruck that starts production next year? How many pre-orders for the roadster with production starting next year? How many pre orders for the big rigs with production (potentially) starting next year?  Factor in the constantly evolving Tesla power wall & solar panels/solar roofs, and 2-3 more products that haven't been announced yet by Tesla, yes- there is huge potential. New factories being built across the world, the potential of buying out other EV companies, and expanding on their super charger system is also on the horizon. And believe me, the second SpaceX (starlink) goes public, I'm in on them as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 00:25:14'] I wouldn't count on Robotaxi or Bot. But I DO count on energy, insurance and the supercharger network to add a sizeable chunk to their profits....so I still think the stock is (criminally) undervalued.A good indicator of this is the still ongoing FUD campaigns. If Tesla weren't a big threat to someone's piece of the pie then no one would be dumping money into such campaigns.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 20:11:54'] No. I like Tesla, I want shares of Tesla, but not at the current prices. If that means I miss my chance, so be it. Not the first time sticking to my value investment strategy has caused me to miss a boat, won't be the last, I'm sure.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 01:47:58'] > Extreme growth: They have a 51% revenue CAGR starting with the realease of the model s in 2013 up until last year. This year they will probably have another 50% growth and <<probably>> another 50% in 2023. The point is that so far over the long run TSLA has grown extremely quickly and consistently. They will also have new models such as Semi, cybertruck and roadster arriving <<probably>> next year. AND they sell their cars with excellent margins. So their growth is very sustainable.They will not grow 50% this year. Inflation forces people to lower their luxury choices. With the cheapest Model 3 now being over 46k, the market is smaller. Regarding the growth, you seem to miss that competition is already there with the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Porsche Taycan. VW is also pushing hard. The Semi, Cybertruck and Roadster 2 have been announced years (Roadster 2 in 2017) and we have not seen any progress. The high margins are worrying, not a positive. Car companies generally have terrible margins as it is a high capex business. EVs don't change that. So if you have high margins, that means you have a technology advantage - which Tesla did have for years. But that is changing. Nearly all car companies work together with the same batteries suppliers as well.I would say that that growth is not sustainable. If the growth is just 20% (which would still be huge in a recession/inflationary environment), the stock would go down 60%+. > Diverse and unique side businesses: As of this moment tesla gets the vast majority of its revenue and profit from selling cars, thats undeniable. But they have a lot of aspirations. Firstly, energy storage is going to be cruicial in transitioning the world to sustainable energy and tesla is at the forefront of this industry and are therefore in a prime position to capitalize on that. Aspirations are cool, but results matter. Tesla is not at the forefront of battery storage and they don't have a technology advantage here. It will also be a low margin business.> Secondly tesla is dabbling with insurance and juding by their lates report that business unit seems to be breaking even and soon will become profitable. It has only launched in a few states so far and there is a lot of room to grow. Insurance is a highly regulated area and just 1 year of Tesla insurance does not mean, that they can become profitable. Insurance go through good and bad times and those often come unexpetec. > Solar shignles and solar in general is also another potential area for growth although tesla doesn't seem to be prioritizing it.The solar shingles where Elon did not represent a working unit at the presentation, very trustworthy. > Autonomy: Elon has many times over estimated his own timelines so this point is a little weak BUT if tesla does indeed manage to actually get FSD working properly (im guessing 2025 is the year where they start driving tens of thousands of kilometers without any issues) then tesla is poised to make a ridiculous amount of money. And if my grandmother has wheels, she would be a bike. THere is no indication that Tesla is any closer to true FSD than back in 2017. Mercedes was the first to get L3 regulatory approval. > Since the vast majority of teslas by that time will have the hardware necessary to become autonomous, teslas will turn from depreciating cars to profit producing assets. This will have a massive effect on the whole auto industry and no doubt make tesla a lot of money. This is of course very risky but even if they have a 10% chance of pulling it off, id say its worth it.I would say they have 0% of pulling it off. Any how many people will really share their cars with strangers?> With all the infrastructure tesla is developing for AI, they could conceivably rent it out to other companies such as AWS but for AI training. Tesla hasn't spoken about this to my knowledge but once FSD is fully trained and has incredibly low failure rates, this would be a great use for all that hardware.Again where is the proof that they have anything tangible? I see Waymo driving driverless, I don't see Tesla. > Tesla bot? Similar to point 3 but 1% chance of succeeding. But again if they do succeed, trillions of dollars could be made.0% chance that they pull it off. Boston Dynamics is the leader here. Look at the R&D Budget of Tesla and with letting people go - how should that be accomplished?> they need to fix vehicle quality and service. It doesn't seem to be a problem right now since demand is so much higher than supply but in the future it could become a problem.It is already a problem in Germany, in that they probably fail the T√úV after 3 years. I guess there might be potential lawsuits.> There seems to be a massive minerals shortage (lithium) coming. Not sure how tesla will handle this but even if they do secure all the materials they need, their price will be extremely high.And margins will compress, thus reducing the implied valuation.> With all of this being said tesla right now has a PE ratio of about 90. To give some context back in 2017-18 amazon had a similar PE while growing slower. They were already maxing out all their business lines. Tesla on the other hand is just getting started. They seems to have all the core technologies nailed and with a very solid roadmap ahead. So all in all, at this point in time, tesla seems to be a solid buy, just like amazon was 5 years ago, probably even better.Amazon is mostly a tech company, while Tesla is a car company with huge capex. Tesla is valued as though they would sell 10m cars, have twice the margin of Toyota with twice the Average Selling Price and twice the valuation. One misstep and they fall 80%+> Im curious to hear counter arguments to this. I keep seeing posts about how tesla is incredibly overpriced and that was true a year or two ago but imo not anymore.Still true and even more so given the high inflation of materials. Lithium was around 77k in 2019, it is now at 477k. Tesla is the Cisco of our era. Look at the stock price of Cisco and news from the dotcom time. Very similar.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 00:22:51'] $150 is fair valuethere's really nothing super special about these ev's compared to other brands.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 04:35:46'] The issue with Tesla is the same issue that Netflix is now realizing: COMPETITION.You have all the major brands that are going to be building electric vehicles. They have the know how, they have the scale and they have the money (just like Tesla). I would argue, more so for the major brand companies, they also have far better quality control!Fundamentally, when comparing Tesla to its competitors, it is 100% overvalued.I would argue, especially if we are heading into any type of recession, that the company is, in fact, a short position candidate, not a buy.I think that when BMW, Mercedes, GM, Ford, VW all start to roll out their product, we are going to see that Tesla's stock is going to come back down to earth.I love Musk but every stock has its run and Tesla has had one hell of a run but now the competition is coming.No, it's not fairly valued. It is overvalued in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 08:18:54'] Not when Google is stuck with a 20 PE and is an actual tech company lol. Come on down to our PE range.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 09:07:01'] All of this talk and almost no discussion about how a $700B+ valuation is justified.  PE is currently 92.  They warrant a high PE no doubt, but the question is whether "high" should mean 40 or 70 or 90 or 110.  That's the discussion I'd like to see.I don't think Tesla will continue 50% growth for long.  Yes, they've averaged that and probably still have some of that left.  But it's not clear to me that the timeline on that is indefinite.The big question is when Tesla's sales will become demand-ristricted rather than supply-restricted.  With competition increasing, that might not be too far into the future.  A lot of people erroneously think the question is whether Tesla can make more money than Ford or VW.  That's not the question.  It's how much market share VW and Ford (and others) end up with and where that leaves Tesla.  Also, will Tesla's margins survive increased competition and a demand-restricted environment?  My guess is no.To pre-empt the same arguments I see everytime this stock comes up: Yes, I get the whole "The EV pie is getting bigger, so even reduced market share is still more EVs sold" thing.  I also get that Tesla is currently supply-restricted rather than demand-restricted.  And I get that many legacy automakers have a capital and debt weight around their necks.&#x200B;Edit to add: Also, why is the Cybertruck also "about to come out"?  I've been hearing this for years.Edit to add #2: The future telling of Tesla folks reminds me of Enron's accounting.  Let's take all the future profit we expect to make from an idea we had today and count it as revenue right now!
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 20:10:31'] I'm new, but I think we're going to a new (old) era that many aren't familiar with. It seems like anything with high PE will eventually get crushed.  No one seems interested in hopes and dreams, and I think we're just getting started on that path.i.e. General Mills is destroying Tesla right now
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 01:53:34'] Pretty much agree.Personally I don't count FSD or Tesla bot in my projections (if either pans out then hold on to your hats!). However, the potential in the energy sector alone is enormous (storage. Particularly in the context of virtual powerplants). Can't wait till they expand Tesla insurance to Europe. Insta-buy.Then there's the opening up of the supercharger network. With how reliable it is and how many more stalls per location are present compared to other charging networks it could very well become the go-to charging location for people. Globally(!). That could very well become massively lucrative.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 20:53:13'] Ok, against my better judgement I am going to bite.  If I look at the charts, Tesla is below it's 20/50/100/200 DMA's on the 3 month charts.  If I look at the 2 year charts Tesla is below the 20/50/100 DMA's.  It has support on the 200 DMA at $411.99.  So If I am a technical investor that's where I consider BTD. Now that's before the cost of capital has risen from Zero to 1.5-1.7% in 3 months with the Fed raising interest rates.  That cost will likely raise to 2%-2.25% after the next Fed meeting.Be Careful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 20:46:39'] I don't agree that it's priced fairly.  I've been holding shares for a while but don't plan on adding until we get a better idea of where things are heading economically. I won't get into that because you're only talking about the valuation... and you also think aspirations and future products are going to matter anytime soon.Comparing it to Amazon doesn't mean add anything to your argument. We were at a different phase of the market cycle. You think it's a "pretty decent buy" but haven't bought any shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 20:53:13'] If you're argument for buying tesla is based on it being "fairly priced" you are way off the mark.as you stated its current market cap is $710B. its current market cap is pricing it as if its already achieved alot of its Revenue streams. its literally in the top 10 biggest company based on market cap (probably top 5 i think?)look at all the other companies that are in the top 10. they literally had to fight tooth and nail and actually cement themselves into the world to get to where they are
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 22:18:08'] wait until after earnings next month. nobody knows their delivery numbers for Q2 because of the supply chain issues and Shanghai covid lockdowns
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-29 22:19:11'] It is interesting how Tesla is tied to Musk's personality.He's now a Texas Republican, and liberals hate him. Tesla might be around for a long time, but how is it worth more than Ford?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 03:05:17'] With a P/E of 92? Far from fair.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 03:17:30'] Everyone tries to justify the price/p/e because there is " extreme growth " potential. The only advantage they have is a first foot in the door and the fact the CEO has a cult like following. Wait until every other major car company has EV's pumping out left and right. You think Apple won't have an EV coming? Shit google will probably have an EV. The point is Tesla's run will only last so long so that "extreme growth" reasoning doesn't really resonate. What MOAT does Tesla have honestly? Other than brand loyalty, there really is none.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 16:31:16'] I could be wrong but I don't see the hype around FSD. As a convenience feature, sure, but your car still depreciates. And if there's a million folks dumping their tesla's on the market as taxis that drives the price of taxi service down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-30 18:25:02'] Tesla is not going to see "extreme growth" this year. I suppose anything could happen, but all while GDP is negative, that's not when these discretionary companies do well. Tesla still doesn't have a car that an average person can afford. When consumers are squeezed, this is what's cut.

Dudes a monster troll.Do you seriously think he planned for a year to buy Twitter and somehow had no idea they had bots before the big dog and pony show? And he made a huge offer with no research? He's a clown.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-09 09:30:04'] >Elon started acquiring Twitter stock, before he sold large chunk of TSLA shares, which was done for tax purposes according to him.This is wrong. He sold the Tesla shares in November 2021 and the 13G indicated that he surpassed the threshold of 5% ownership from Twitter on 14.March 2022&#x200B;>Elon acquired the largest portion of the capital needed for the acquisition of Twitter by getting loans against his shares and attracting numerous high-profile outside investors like Larry Ellison and the Qatar state investment fund.

This was probably planned at least a year in advance, so the great oracle Elon probably did not have the chance to perfectly time his TSLA selling to maximise his profits.Looking at his actions, he did not do any proper research on Twitter. It is clear that from his action and the "tax-excuse" (which he could have paid selling less shares than he did, or borrowing against his shares) -  that he is trying to sell Tesla stock. He does not want to crash the stock price tho. &#x200B;>Do you actually think that a guy who tweeted that the TSLA share price is too high cares so much about his shareholders opinion, so he will orchestrate a very expensive and time consuming operation that could potentially greatly harm his public and business persona, just so he will have an excuse to sell his TSLA shares? Musk has stated numerous times that the sole purpose for his accumulation of wealth is to secure the funding for the dream of his life, which is making humans interplanetary species. Couldn't he just have said that he is going to sell a small portion of his TSLA holdings for that reason?There is only one thing that he visible cares about, and that is his fortune. Everything from the stock options to how he lives shows that. Nah if he would sold for "interplanetary" reasons, I doubt many would believe him. &#x200B;>No, TSLA stock probably would not have crashed even if he did not state any reason for the reduction of his stake in the company. It is not like he sold 50 percent. Also, have you seen how devoted are the teslabros?It is exactly why it would have crashed the stock if he did not give any reasons. They are very devoted, so they would question his leadership if he sold and probably would do the same.   >I obviously can't say for certain why Elon decided to back out of the deal. My personal opinion is that he probably just changed his mind in part due to miner setbacks like the number of bots on the site. As we all know , he is not very stable as a person and it is probably not as deep as many people think it is.The bots are just an excuse. What many forget is also that the company talks about monetised accounts are 5% bots. Meaning that Elon would have to prove, that more than 10% of Twitter's revenue would come from bots. If that would be true, there would be another bunch of lawsuits against the board and Jack Dorsey. Yes it is not as deep as many think. He knows Tesla is overvalued, so he tries to sell as many shares as possible, without imploding the stock -  as he has many loans collatarized against them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 01:46:11'] TESLA was a one-off. Stocks like that don't happen in rapid succession (and certainly not in the same space, so looking to other EV companies is a fool's errand)They disrupted the entire car space (and more) that encompasses a huge capitalization which went their way.So if you want to look to similar stocks (as, I guess, most of us are doing)  then I would suggest the following things to look for in a company:\- it is investing heavily in R&D and expansion - even before profitability\- (it has an idea for an ecosystem and not just a singular/niche solution)\- it is gearing up to attack a GLOBAL market with its investments (not just local to one country)\- it is either going to disrupt a market that is already hugely valued (e.g. food, energy, medical, transport, internet/social media) or is going to solve a problem that will hit the entire world in short order (e.g. water shortages due to climate change) or is addressing an issue that will come up in the near future (e.g. large scale battery, solar panel or wind turbine recycling)\- there are no other players doing the same (at least not to that order of magnitude)Be prepared to wait (i.e. invest and then just let it sit for a couple years - even if the stock doesn't move). With disruption it is pretty much impossible to predict that point in time when such a business will take off.Sectors I'm currently looking into that fit the bill: Virtual power plants (if possible including thermal energy storage); Water desalination; Vertical farming; Artificially grown meat; Electric/battery powered shipping and aviation; Battery recycling; Agriphotovoltaics

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-19 10:53:45'] I think one that was on a great trend before it was categorized as a meme stock is MVIS. I‚Äôve been trading it since April 2020 when I first learned of the tech and possibilities. I bought 5k shares in April/May timeframe for $0.87 average. Then sold 2.5k when it jumped to $3.50(done to ride on house money + extra spending money). Kept 2.5k up to the ride to $27.50ish and sold 1.4k there. I‚Äôm still holding 1.1k shares and have added multiple leap calls on this large dip. 20+ calls of $8 19 January 2024 expiration. Like I said it was turned into a meme stock and has been shorted hard. However, the tech is there. It‚Äôs impressive and I believe highly undervalued. With the rise of LiDar and EVs this will surely go parabolic again. For more research that‚Äôs been meticulously cataloged go to r/MVIS.

It destroyed the algorithms and caused billions of damage. The only stock following that path right now especially pre split is GameStop.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:02:34'] GOOG is up about 6% since earnings and announcing the split which is pretty solid. If you bought the day after earnings then you were late to the game and buying the news. That said it'll be gaining plenty leading up to July assuming the market generally trends upwards and I'd expect more movement post split then pre
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 16:55:36'] Google is already up 6% and it was less than a week ago we found out about the split.I would expect Google share price to continue to appreciate faster than the overall market going in to the split.The split will mean Google can join the DJIA which is a nice tailwind.But just overall Google is just killing and you want to own.I thought Apple had a great quarter. Google put up over 3 times the growth rate of Apple!!out of all the FANGs you have Google growing by far the fastest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow.Google still has tons of assets that the have yet to monetize or fully monetized.Take Android. Over a billion devices activated per year and Google does not charge a cent. They could do a nominal license fee of $10 and add over $10 billion of revenue which really would be profit as it would not add any new expense.But Android is just one example. Google has so many others which just make a massive runway for Google. So if growth starts to slow Google has plenty of levers to pull to keep it going for a very long time. Plus Google keeps adding new ones.People forget that Google is half the age of Microsoft and Apple. It is only a matter of time until Google passes Apple. They already blew past Microsoft. Google has more revenue and makes a lot more than Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook or Netflix. FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.Google is also going to do a 20:1 stock split which means they can now join the DJIA. Probably replacing IBM but it could be CSCO (Cisco). That will also give an additional strong tailwind.But the other thing really going for Google is the financial engineering. Google bought back over $50 billion in their own shares in 2021. That means less outstanding shares which then just increases EPS as there are less shares.Google had over $65 billion in free cash flow in 2021. They also have over $140 billion in cash just doing basically nothing. Google could really increase their buyback and that significantly decreases shares. So share price appreciations with Google basically doing nothing. Why they call it financial engineering.BTW, in the past people would say there is this law of large numbers. Which was such a croc. It was the reason given for Apple growth slowing. Well Google has finally put that to rest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow. They are now an over $250 billion dollar business. Will be well over $300 billion next year.I am old but I have never seen a more amazing company. The fastest in history to get to 1 trillion market cap. Then the fastest to $2 trillion. Amazon is actually three years older than Google and why the records are with Google.People think Google genius is with their technology. But actually the most genius thing they did was using the dutch auction for search. That was just brilliant. It will also help them with the government as Google does not set price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:03:56'] There will be a run up Google but much closer to July when the split happens.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 10:29:36'] Google has NEVER traded the way that Tesla has and thinking that it will is a mistake. It can move in a big way, but a big move for it is more like jumping 30% over a time period of a few months, and Tesla has pulled 50%+ in a month.If the worst of it is over for the Nasdaq, this can trade $3300-3500 by July. I'd be really surprised if it was more.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:37:59'] Plenty of time before July. People are waiting to see what happens after rate hikes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 11:39:06'] I think the wait for the google split has a lot to do with it. AAPL and NVDA both split within 4-5 weeks of the announcement, GOOG on the other hand won‚Äôt split for another 5 months. It‚Äôs pre split run up should start mid June, possibly sooner. I feel your pain though, grabbed some shares as well after the announcement and am down. It‚Äôll recover though and a great long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 13:15:13'] We're those splits occurring when the market trend was bullish? Because the trend right now is bearish, with signs of it possibly going either way. People might be hesitant. All those other stocks also weren't 3k prior to split?

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 18:23:43'] First, Google already went up earning, and it holds up better than the market currently. It's a giant company so you need BIG big money to move the stock.Second, we are in a different market environment. Sentiment changes and right now the market worries about a lot of things. If Google has done this last year, maybe you would've a similar run like others that have done splits. The market doesn't have a big appetize for speculative plays right now. It values stocks where they're deserved, and punish those severely that don't put up good results.You made a risky gamble and assumed everything should follow precedents when we are in a different mood. This is what happen after a market euphoria. Retail traders thought they were making easy money and thinking this could go on forever. A lot of people got destroyed speculating on garbage small caps suggested in this sub. Unfortunately, you may have to go through one too, to learn that timing the market, especially using risky strategy like buying OTM option, will cost you dearly when you're wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 02:39:30'] I don't get it why people are afraid that in a recession a monopoly like Google will be affected more than it's market. Guys, when things go bad you cant afford looking for scraps to spend the (cut) marketing budget, you go for what you know it works. Google will bounce up when the market calms down in volatility, probably after the first rate hike. I can tell you when th going gets tough the marketing spend is the first to take a hit, no more events, sponsorship and so on. You have to stick to the basics and google is as basic as you can go.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 17:43:03'] A better question would be: why would a stock go parabolic after a split?  The answer to that is either the stock action had nothing to do with the split or people are stupid.  If the action had nothing to do with the split, then your question is answered.  If the answer is people are stupid, then what we can see is stupid people dump more money in the market when everything is going up than when they are getting burned by their other stupid speculative trades (see all the hot tech companies that are down 50+% right now).

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-06 22:05:41'] At a 20:1 split many retail customers can‚Äôt even afford a few shares so will probably wait till closer to the split or the split if it doesn‚Äôt start rising.Also big money can‚Äôt even move the stock too much because of the price. It‚Äôs easier for big money to drop their stake in a more expensive stock temporarily and buy lots of shares of a lower priced one than the other way around.Lastly .. you can never look at what another stock did as a guideline to what a current stock will do.There is too much reverse psychology and misdirection going on.

That should accommodate OTM calls because let's face it, no one can afford ITM calls right now. I plan to buy one huge Jan 2024 when the next Fed Ted talks go through to see where the sentiment is, then throwdown on it and let it ride.  If it spikes like crazy presplit and post split, I'll probably sell.  If not, theta will guide my way through whatever the hell is gonna happen this year

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-01 14:29:39'] Try doing it in a 5 year horizon
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-01 19:47:46'] Wow. Who would‚Äôve thought holding the S&P500 and a stock that went up 44% in a year would out perform a poorly run ETF full of worthless overpriced speculative junk stocks. Who woulda thought. I guess hindsight is 20/20.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-01 23:52:49'] Keep in mind that ARK generally uses a 5 year timeframe for it's analysis, so judging it over a couple years or so isn't really useful. The irony here is that you are complaining about having to go back to 2017 for to beat performance when *2017 is actually about 5 years ago*, making it within their time horizon, so sounds like as far as ARK's investment thesis goes, they are doing well enough, though definitely not as well as they would like to be or be doing. Still it is true that if you got into ARKK a couple years or so again, your timing hasn't been the best.Also, ARKK specifically has TSLA in it and TSLA has been rocking it compared to their portfolio average, so they need to keep selling it off to avoid being too heavy into it, which isn't helping. Sadly, everything else is doing poorly too when TSLA is down, so they don't get a chance to buy the dip a while back either.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-02 03:05:11'] ARKK and Catie Wood herself are a f@cking big lie. That's all. Like in the casino, she put everything on one color. It looks like this doesn't work. But at least she earned a lot......

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 21:34:51'] I had drinks with a friend yesterday and he was talking about how he was using chatGPT to save time for work. I had dinner with another set of friends today, 2 working ppl in different fields. One's an accountant, and the other in medicine fields. They're using chatGPT to write their business proposals for bank loans. Savings hours of time, maybe 100s of hours. Same for writing reports for patients. Ppl are saving 100s of hours in their jobs, across several fields. This isn't a what if, its happening today.&#x200B;Is it perfect? No, but neither are google search queries and google is a trillion dollar company now. I've never seen a tool become so widespread in such a short time span in my life. This isn't a bubble, its a revolution.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 23:23:42'] Stock market bubble != technology bubble. The same happened i 2000s dot.com bubble - stock market collapsed but it didnt make the Internet as technology obsolete. Quite the opposite - it thrived and to this day it is the backbone of the global economy and everyday life.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 21:18:20'] Outside of ChatGPT, AI hasn‚Äôt even started at scale yet. Sure, people are buying MSFT and NVDA, but both of those tickers are still below their high from 2021. I pay close attention to the machine learning community and can assure you no one serious is talking about time travel or anything that goes against the laws of physics. When it comes to AI tech and large language models, it‚Äôs the real deal and the development cycles are now measured in days and months. Also, this isn‚Äôt blockchain or the metaverse ‚Äî AI is already powerful enough today, that as of 2 days ago, some scientists and people like Elon Musk are petitioning to slow down the pace of its development (I don‚Äôt agree we should, but shows how smart minds are taking AI very seriously). So, yes there will be an AI stock bubble at some point (probably later this year and next), but imo we haven‚Äôt seen anything yet. That said, because it‚Äôs so early, one caveat is it‚Äôs not yet clear where the value capture for AI will be ‚Äî aside from companies with established competitive advantages (MSFT/OpenAI, NVDA) and maybe some semis (TSMC, ASML, AMD etc), it‚Äôs a bit premature to pile into AI growth stocks (eg, C3.ai)

I think the metaverse is definitely hype.I think AI will be transformational. I just used it to solve a small annoying problem for me yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 22:46:33'] Bought a large portion of MSFT because they do not seem as overly inflated as nvidia and they stand to gain a fuck ton. MSFT is ruthless. Absolutely ruthless. Not only are they taking on Google but they will replace as many jobs as they possibly can to collect service fees. All they have to do is provide a service equal to or greater than any human and they'll replace 3/4 of every call center team. I suspect most organizations will require a few humans to learn from but the vast majority of calls will be replaced. In Canada, what would be a 50k role MSFT might collect 10k. This is assuming MSFT is the company that drives that optimization. It's also possible that a Startup provides that service. In which case they pay open AI for the access and MSFT gets there cut from the server utilization. I can't seem to find any information on whether Microsoft is an investor of OpenAI but I hope they are. That way investing in Microsoft at least means exposure to OpenAI which is currently private.I also think OpenAI's chatGPT is going to become the invisible 5th member of any team. It is the duck. I think Microsoft and OpenAI have proven this is going to be big and it wouldn't surprise me if Microsofts stock doubles because of it. Many jobs are going to utilize this tech.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 19:45:11'] It doesn't have to be rational. Just look at the insane prices that ARKK stocks, tech stocks, marijuana stocks, WFH stocks, crypto etc hit before crashing back to Earth...or Tesla still.  AI will likely be a big thing unlike most of those

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 18:39:39'] The current situation is to AI is like Dotcom is to the internet, eventually it will be useful, but people pile into anything that mentions AI regardless of how it translates to cashflow.There's even a ticker for AI, it's up 200% YTD despite having deteriorating financials because people see AI = buy.At least NVDA makes money even if the earnings will never catch up to market cap.My guess is the next earnings cycle will kill this bubble or at least stop it from inflating farther until it shows it has the ability to actually make money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 23:28:45'] Personally think it absolutely is a bubble *at this stage*.Companies are jumping on the band wagon how they can leverage AI to do everything and anything and they‚Äôll be a big hype run. It‚Äôll come crashing back down at some point.That said, those tools will be useful in a variety of ways in the future.Think of it like the internet boom, sure they‚Äôll be a lot of pets.com companies using AI that crash and burn. Ultimately it‚Äôll find its place in the economy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 01:28:01'] Well there are moonshots.People have mentioned dotcom but if you look at AMZN's all time chart, it's 1376x.$1000 in 1997 turns into $1.37mil today.If someone invested in 100 different dotcom companies, $1000 each, and all of them failed except for AMZN, that's still 100k -> 1.37mil or over 10% p.a (and AMZN hasn't moved for 5 years)So if we assume AI is similar to dotcom, then hitting a big win AI company will hopefully lead to a huge payout.NVDA and MSFT are the least risky AI plays because even if AI is somehow unprofitable, they still have their existing profitable businesses.Also, why do people think MSFT and NVDA should be priced by only valuing only their existing business? While assigning $0 to AI.Lottery tickets cost money and call options cost money. The probability of additional profits in the future is worth something today.The lottery ticket is worth $0 only after it's been played.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 08:02:31'] AI is without a doubt going to be the most revolutionary advancement the world has ever seen.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 02:41:16'] Nvidia is years away from making any significant money from AI yet the market prices Nvidia as if they could maintain a 35% growth rate for the next ten years whilst also keeping great margins. It's not impossible but it's extremely optimistic. Considering the current economic environment and Nvidias inventory stockpiling and the China Taiwan risk, whoever buys Nvidia at this current price is just extremely bad at math and risk management. The downside risk for the next year or months is much higher than the chances to the upside. Besides as with any new tech, the real winners in the long run will rarely be the ones who were there at the start.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 20:03:47'] I think it‚Äôs more than AI. Nvidia is also boosted by the price of crypto and FAANG seems to be a flight to safety position with the current bank/liquidity issues. Maybe throw in quarterly rebalancing as well. Personally I simply would not touch these at their multiples in a 5% risk free environment but I understand their ‚Äústance‚Äù in the current market. Reminds me of when Costco tÔøºraded at 42x earnings because it was the queen of inflation hedges. Notice too that investors will flat out ignore their earnings and guidance. I don‚Äôt see any holes in the armor yet. TLDR: I‚Äôm a big believer in sector rotation/positioning

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 06:17:50'] AI isn't just Chat GPT, although that one is in the news a lot lately. On the hardware side, Nvidia, Arista Networks, IBM, Intel, AMD (Xilinx), and probably more that I'm not aware of are all making AI hardware. On the software side, you have companies like Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Salesforce, and many others all integrating generative AI into their products. The AI market is expected to grow at a 37% compound annual growth rate from 3.3 billion in 2021 to 16 billion in 2026, according to Goldman Sachs. But most pure AI companies are currently privately held, which makes investing challenging. Honestly though, AI is a revolution in the same way that the Internet was a revolution. It will impact everyone's life. It would be smart to invest in it at an early stage.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 12:25:24'] The "boom" in "AI" we are experiencing now is similar to the NFT and Crypto craze we had for the past few years. The same grifters who glomed onto those crazes are the same one pushing it now, even if its met with overwhelming negative responses. The AI investments banks on being the future of technology while ignoring all of its glaring problems, development time, and myriad of legal issues. ChatGPT is useful in certain cases, mostly mathematical or programming, but look at the amount of people trying to argue politics with it. The community around it barely understand it. They just now it's *something*. It's most defiantly a test of blind faith. I will not be surprise if it crashes and burns like crypto did, especially when the main push for AI right now is creating amalgamations of art based on databases of copyrighted work illegally collated without permission of the creators.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 00:57:13'] The bubble could take years to pop. Technology is finicky like that. If you look back at the .com bubble - it‚Äôs major run up started in 1998, however it didn‚Äôt bottom out until 2001-2002. This is because everyone realized the internet would be the next big thing (like AI) but there are a lot of unknowns. Who will succeed, how profitable, etc. A company could come out tomorrow with a huge breakthrough in AI hardware or software, which I believe would cause many of the other companies to fall. Or there could be a few lackluster earnings reports, and many investors may lose patience and look to put their capital towards companies with better results, especially during a time of economic uncertainty. It‚Äôs difficult to price something that is almost completely unknown, so I suspect there will be wild price action for a while. You are best off DCA into Nasdaq if you believe in the future of AI as there is no way of knowing who will win/lose. Betting against the success of AI isn‚Äôt smart and it isn‚Äôt investing - it‚Äôs gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 04:11:49'] It seems overvalued, but there's a potential huge upside - at some point truly exponential growth may set in, and to have stakes at AI companies at that point would be very profitable.However, the longer this exponential growth is not visible, there's a risk of the bubble popping.Currently the models are OK for generic tasks, but not that great for more specialised ones. I'd be interested to see how good would a potential model be at learning new information from e.g. company-specific internal data source (documentation, etc.). Of course information like that is minuscule in comparison to the datasets LLMs are normally trained on, and so potentially it might still not do that great.Also there's an issue of accuracy - sure, the model may be impressive at times, but that doesn't account for much if you can't really trust it - there has to be a person fact-checking and overseeing the output anyway. It might speed up some processes, but people may be blindsided by how impressive it appears, vs how useful it actually is.

They are not going to talk to us and form ideas, they are going to compute rational responses using a catalog of human thought and work. While this won‚Äôt be Skynet, at least not yet, it will require an entire population to learn how to use them. They appear to be poised to become useful in search, writing, publication, art and creative design, and probably a few unseen uses.If you work in those fields or with those fields you will probably feel the impact sooner than the general population, kinda like touch screens that were used in industry far before practical home uses. It is funny, schools will respond quickly. They will probably begin to use these tools and teach about these tools‚Ä¶ and within 10 years anyone who hasn‚Äôt taught themselves these tools will find themselves at the beginning of a curve not unlike what we see today with ‚Äúboomers‚Äù and they saw with people being unwilling to learn computers.

You can go to bing chat, type "was bailing out credit suisse good or bad" and Bing will compile a pretty damn unbiased, nuanced answer, and cite its sources so you can go double check. That alone has major implications for online search and if perfected, could help search bias become extinct while helping to accurately inform users on their platform.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 11:18:32'] AI in it current state is just a glorified assistant and it's still has huge limitations,  it just a fad.The AI people have grown up watching and reading about doesn't exist, but people want to believe. Already after fake pictures of celebrities like the pope in a puffer coat, they've had to put in restrictions.But they have a lot of other limits and once people see that they'll move on.Sure for some it'll fill a niche roll but it's not going to do what people want it to do.

POST_TEXT: b"Two large tranches of Tesla (TSLA) stock options were traded on May 30: one a near-term in-the-money put position and the other a long-term way out-of-the-money call option. This unusual stock options activity is likely from a large investor.\n\nThe Unusual Stock Options Activity on May 30 showed that there were 13,039 put options traded at the $202.50 strike price for expiration on June 2, this Friday. The second tranche was for 13,064 call options traded at the $310 strike price for expiration on Oct. 20, 2023, 142 days from now.\n\n**Large Calls And Puts In TSLA Stock**\n\nThe first tranche of options (puts) was in-the-money since the price of TSLA stock closed at $201.16 on Tuesday, May 16. The second tranche was way out-of-the-money (OTM) since the $310 call strike price is 54% higher than today's price. \n\nBut interestingly, both had very similar prices. That's what makes me believe that both tranches were likely initiated together. For example, the puts closed at $5.45 per put contract"

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 04:44:38'] When you make a profit with a public company, you can either reinvest those profits or pay some out as dividends to shareholders. Many growth companies do not pay a dividend as both their shareholders and management agree that precious dividend money would be better spent reinvesting in a growing company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 04:34:41'] I buy stock in a company because I think that the company will do better in the future and the stock I own will be worth more. It is the only reason to buy stock. I‚Äôm very concerned about your knowledge of the stock market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 04:49:22'] A stock is partial ownership of the company. Say there are 100,000 shares out there and you own 1 share. You now own 1/100,000 of all the company‚Äôs assets. Theoretically, the stock should be worth that amount. If it‚Äôs selling for more or less than that, it‚Äôs because investors think the company will be worth more or less in the future than it is now. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no intrinsic value as it‚Äôs not linked to any real asset. It‚Äôs price is determined solely by investor sentiment about its future value. Investing in Bitcoin is inherently less safe than stocks and is more akin to foreign currency speculation. It can be done successfully, of course, but it‚Äôs a risky bet.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 05:08:21'] Many of the concepts of public companies are easier to understand if you translate them to the equivalent situation for a small business.Imagine a liquor store down the street from you.  It is owned by 3 partners.   It makes a profit and then needs to decide what to do with it,   They can pass out profits to the 3 owners, or they can use the profits to invest in more inventory.  Or they can use the profits to expand the business by renting another building and opening another store.   It uses up money now, but with the expectation of more profits later.  So they aren't handing out a dividend, but they are adding value to their business.Tesla is reinvesting their profits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 05:29:42'] The value of a company are future payments you will receive. You don‚Äôt know if any company will pay dividends or buy back stocks in the future. Therefore, any stockprice is based on ‚Äûhope‚Äú.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 05:38:13'] Think of it like a rental property. Say you buy a house. You rent it out and net $100 a month. You can pocket that money (dividend) or you can not pocket the money and upgrade the flooring from carpet to hardwood. Next year maybe some fancy landscaping, the year after that. As you improve the property people like it more so you raise the rent‚Ä¶. Now you‚Äôre netting $125 a month. Maybe you buy the property next door and rent THAT out. If you did all that, never pocketing a nickel is it reasonable to assume your business is worth more than when you started?  You bet, you have an upgraded property getting higher rent plus an additional property.  That being said, HOW MUCH more should it be worth?  The asset (stuff) itself has value, and the rent money has value. How to determine that value is the trick. And reasonable people can disagree on that methodology. Using Tesla as an example, there are people who think that due to their sales growth that a 70 P/E ratio is a reasonable multiple to pay for that kind of growth. Others think that‚Äôs nuts. That‚Äôs the art of investing. Additionally. Dividends are terribly tax inefficient. I would suggest watching the YouTube channel everything money. Very good content IMO
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-09 05:41:34'] My friend, your topic is under the acceptable level of understanding of the stock market, better stick to ETFs. When you buy a stock you don't buy dividends or some fixed income contract pegged to the number of shares. You buy all future cash flows and the products that can sustain that growth while generating growing FCF.SO, you can have the highest dividend growth company in the world, if they run out of cash in 6 months they will go bankrupt and nobody wil want to buy their stock.

Companies are often unprofitable for years.  Valuations are about the future.  Amazon was famously unprofitable for years.  Should the stock have been worth nothing then?  It's hard to argue that since they've now made over $275B in total.  So even unprofitable companies can be worth money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 19:13:54'] Cathie Woods is gonna fall hard if tsla goes back to where it should be valued. And if it does that, a lot of money will flow out of the sexy ARK funds. Right now she props up all of her overvalued stocks by releasing new crazy PT's and going on CNBC and saying how undervalued they are. She has a serous following of retail investors that buy stocks she is getting into (me included sometimes) that will run for the hills the second a correction comes
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-22 19:14:29'] I would buy for a trade but this one has a long way down if market is reevaluating if interest rate has bottomed for good! If so, we might just seen the best so far.

POST_TEXT: b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/tesla-2023-investor-day-after-the-bell-master-plan-part-3-teased.html\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla hosted a 2023 Investor Day presentation in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his Master Plan 3, and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.\n\nThe presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.\n\nNear the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, There is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesnt require destroying natural habitats. It doesnt require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything. He added, In fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.\n\nMusk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Eng'

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 00:25:22'] Fell short on details? It was highly technical. Sure it didn't unveil any major new products but they have too much already on their plate. I was glad to see they're focusing on scaling up and reducing costs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 09:49:42'] They didn‚Äôt announce the new lineup because it will cannibalise today‚Äôs sales. The M3 and MY will continue to sell, the Cybertruck will ramp up next year and sell. They will use all of that money to invest in new factories to create the hatchback, van and Robotaxi efficiently. What I got from that is that consumers can choose between a cheap Ford or Toyota or a new Tesla for less money. Once the production ramps up the auto industry will change significantly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 23:41:07'] It was an incredible event. Really great to watch as a long term investor. But it's always like this, people hype themselves up in the days leading up to an event and are disappointed because the focus never is short term. They literally started the event off saying this wasn't with the next few quarters in mind in any way. I really loved it because it confirms many of my thought and because they were transparent about how they work and optimize. Was also nice to see other executives get the spotlight.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 00:43:54'] I think the lack of major products unveiled and the emphasis on scaling and cost reduction is a great sign. I see this as an indication Tesla knows it has a winning path ahead and they're narrowing their focus on their existing product line.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 22:51:10'] It reminds me of school where some of us would show up with zero prep, thinking that we could just wing it. Then we all failed the test and learnt a lesson only to be forgotten in subsequent years. Elons focussed on Twitter, white fragility, spaceX, hyperloop, moving to Texas from CA then back to CA, responding to fan boys on Twitter. No product plans or specifics on an investor day. Investors rewarded his poor prep and wasting their time with climate101 by dropping the stock more than 5%. Hopefully this slap in the face makes Clownon respect investors, media and future Tesla buyers and give them something concrete, assuming Tesla has real plans
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 00:54:55'] I was shocked by the lack of ability to present, speak and explain concepts you're working on since a lot of years by some of them. 2-3 highly placed head of department were speaking like they were 11 yo, unable to speak without looking at notes, having issue in the language to explain properly and choose the right wording. Either it makes me think that they haven't properly prepared for this presentation, or the average American educations and skills level decreased significantly recently.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 11:37:56'] That was a ridiculous presentation done yesterday with all pie in the sky information. No real info on how fast they are ramping up 4680 cells (back in 2020 they were talking as if it will be mass production mode in 2022 changing the battery landscape). Plus continuous delay of their products launched previously. Biggest of all the small car launch is also delayed big time. they will have to get the Mexico GF built before that can be started and I am not convinced they will directly jump to new platform with new GF. Probably 2026 or later. Plus I dont even have to mention so called "FSD". its a L2 system that is no where close to being called FSD. Its already valued like a tech company. Let us see how they navigate various issues as they sell more and more cars. They had to reduce price big time to get demand and I am not convinced even that is long term sustainable as even after discount, its still an expensive car. They need a cheaper car for next level of growth and that is not happening in the near future. &#x200B;I would rather bet on BYD than TSLA at this point.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-26 13:06:00'] Relax.  It's a short-term drop just like all the other Tesla drops.Eventually it could reach a time where it will get a big drop that will be more permanent to bring the valuation more in line with the fundamentals, but this is not that time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-26 13:28:55'] I see where you are coming from, but you need to realize that you are investing in the whole company and not just in Elon. Tesla has thousands of employees. If Musk gets sick or even dies, Tesla does not just stop existing. Just like Jobs and Apple, someone else takes over the role of CEO and continues delivering value to the shareholders.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 04:32:14'] If you need it in a few years, for something so important that you can't afford to lose the capital, you might as well just keep it as cash. Cash in a fidelity account is automatically invested in a money market, north of 4%, maybe like 4.5%. On 100k in 3yrs that's not bad, will not beat inflation but it's pretty safe. Otherwise you can risk it, but for what annualized returns of 8%-10% on average? For 3 years? Too much downside IMO. If you're hellbound on stocks, I'd just diversify or look at healthcare. It has underperformed tech by a lot this year but outperformed last year and is considered safe. However, it's subject to political whims. Also, if there's a black swan event like in 2020 and market absolutely tanks, you'd be in a position to take advantage of that. Probably won't happen, you never know.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 01:37:19'] You're looking for diversification, probably because you're heavily concentrated in a single asset right now.  The company stock probably makes up a significant fraction of your net worth, right?So I wouldn't buy any individual stocks.  That wouldn't be enough diversification for my tastes.  I would go with an index fund (which is basically as maximally diversified as it gets).

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:54:25'] Anyone telling you to invest in anything other than Fixed income right now is so far off base.If you plan on using the funds within 2-3 years, it should not be invested in any sort of stock investment. Instead, look at some brokerage firms and see who will give the best CD or bond rate for what you‚Äôre looking for timeframe wise. If you‚Äôre buying a house, you don‚Äôt want to find yourself in a rut if the stock has gone down in value, fixed income makes sure you retain your cash while earning a little extra more than a bank account.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 00:19:17'] If you just wanna keep it as cash or something close to it, get bonds. Stocks fluctuate in the short term and are a really bad means of keeping liquidity that you might need at a specific date. Keep in stocks only money that you won't be needing any time soon.

And Twitter CEO Elon Musk openly admits that their company hemorrhaging cash and had to de-list the stock (before the NYSE would do it for him) also wouldn't recommend door dash, Uber, Lyft, or GrubHub...Some maybes are: Amazon and Disney, and Netflix, and coca cola, and Pepsi.

I mean, good lord, a market cap of 500B on 24b annual revenue?  You're basically buying into the stock at a price that MIGHT be fair if they had like 80% of the global auto market share.  Even worse, look at the price to book value.  It's unreal. Yea, yea, I get it, they are a tech company and not a car company, but fundamentals matter and it seems like if TSLA ever has anything that doesn't 'blow away earnings estimates' the stock will be in free fall.  If you're young, you should gamble with a small amount of your portfolio, but please realize that buying TSLA at their current valuation is exactly that, gambling, big time, and not a sound investment for long term buy and hold strategies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 14:52:50'] Good arguments. I think we need to compare Ford margins with Tesla when both were producing equal numbers of EV (several years younger Tesla). It would not surprise me if they were similar as producing 10-20 times more car improves unit economics significantly.Comparing Ford's limited scale with Tesla's already scaled up business would be inappropriate.Off course, manufacturers know this and they will try to scale as rapidly as possible. upcoming competition to Tesla and bear thesis is indeed intact in my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 19:03:05'] I am bullish on both ford and tesla. One thing you are forgetting is that the pickup truck market is the largest segment of the auto industry by a large margin and it is a lot of small businesses that invest into pickup trucks. They are willing to pay higher prices because they can depreciate the cost. The cybertruck has no hope of genuinely competing with the lightning imo so one risk to tesla is over investing into the cybertruck. They will sell some for sure, but their R&D budget would be better placed into other models and improving their plants. I think there is more than enough room for both in the market, and I think tesla will continue to grow rapidly, but I wouldn't count out ford
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-27 12:27:14'] This reads much more like a bearish case on Ford and most auto companies than a bullish case for Tesla.That said, I agree that Ford's inability to profit off the Mach-E, and their recalls of it, show exactly why the thinking that legacy auto will walk right over Tesla is flawed.The fact that Ford set their prices so low with such a thin profit margin that they're now losing money on Mach-E sales, and they aren't raising prices to compensate, shows that they lack pricing power. And the fact that they've had to recall all the Mach-E's ever made, and stop selling Mach-E's for now, shows that Ford lacks experience making EV's, which is causing them to produce low quality EV's with various problems. This is exactly why I've been saying that if you want a high quality EV you'll go with a Tesla, and not someone known for making good ICE vehicles.

POST: ['2022-04-18 09:39:00'] POST TITLE: b'NIO vs TSLA analysis'
POST_TEXT: b"I've never been a fan of NIO but just noticed that with a 34B MCap it has revenue of 36B. TSLA is a 1000B MCap but with sales of only 50B  \n\nTSLA is profitable and NIO isn't yet .\nNIO is under$20 while TSLA near $1000."
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 10:01:18'] Jesus Christ‚Ä¶. Their revenue is 5.6 billion USD, which is equivalent to 36 billion RMB (Chinese yuan).
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 09:43:04'] Nio is more fairly valued, but is Chinese, is less likely to succeed, and has much smaller possible revenue streams. If Nio wasn‚Äôt in China I would be buying
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 11:09:07'] NIO has revenue of 36B yuan probably
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 10:22:00'] Nio and Xpeng are going to do to EVs what the Japanese (Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Subaru) did to ICEs. First you'll see a few NIOs in California and think "oh cool, giving Tesla a run for their money haha". You will see more and more and won't think anything of it, and then one day you'll wake up and realize...they are everywhere...
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 11:00:25'] Aside from the comparison you make that makes 0 sense. FIrst of all they are not doing anywhere near the 36B USD in revenue.. And those share prices mean nothing without an oustanding shares amount. Nio is still far from priced "fairly" just like Tesla is an overpriced EV stock.. worse is that its a Chinese stock with no actual inhouse production and its growing at a slower rate than Tesla while being horribly unprofitable. Stock can go easily -50% from this point. With Tesla thats less of a risk actually even with how stupidly overpriced they are now. They are making good profits have incredible efficient factories of which an additonal 2 opened and it seems like unlimited demand.. Before 2023 end they will approach 3 million cars sold annualy and thats not even accounting for their energy segment. WIth current pricing their PE would be somewhere 80-100 range.  While still providing a signifcant growth story. so yeah.. Bit basic but even at this point i would put my money on Tesla instead of Nio.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 09:43:16'] It‚Äôs the China discount. You shouldn‚Äôt value Tesla the same as you would NIO they operate in very different laws and regulation. I won‚Äôt go into ADR and VIE structure as it‚Äôs been repeated enough (and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll research it before buying). It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean NIO is bad. It‚Äôs just the risks are much different.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 11:59:03'] You confused the currency of NIO, which is an honest mistake. But comparing them by their share price is some amateur hour shit. I really don't get why you did that when you already compared their market caps
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 17:30:00'] Ford is better
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-19 01:13:00'] This is purely anecdotal, but I will say that I absolutely NEVER see Nio's here in China. I see a shit ton of Tesla, Xpeng, and then some super discount brands. It's rare I see a Nio.Take that for what it's worth, but my eyes have been peeled this past year just simply taking note of what EV's I see here in China.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 09:43:35'] NIO is associated with China, TSLA is not. TSLA is a horse, NIO is a donkey.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 10:33:09'] Chinese stocks are uninvestable
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 09:42:34'] NIO will be in triple digits soon. The deliveries for their newest flagship (ET5 & ET7 models) will be crazy!
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 10:29:04'] The big question is, will Nio ever become profitable? It seems like there‚Äôs not too much confidence in that happening in the near term.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 10:56:26'] Chinese ADR vs US company, that‚Äôs all I need.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 11:55:17'] Tesla is more than just a car company. They‚Äôre a data and AI company. I don‚Äôt know if NIO is near the ai/Data company that Tesla is.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-18 11:38:19'] At the risk of sounding a bit repetitive: Tesla isn't a car company. And even if you persist at falsely looking at it as "just a car company" it's a "car company plus all the suppliers that an ordinary car company has" (vertical integration).So comparisons like these ("Tesla vs. NIO" or "Tesla vs. Ford" or similar) make very little sense.That said you didn't even notice that the "36B" revenue for NIO are in chinese yuan - not dollars. If you call what you did an "analysis" then you clearly should let someone else do the analyzing for you.

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-10 14:05:38'] Look. This company has a per over 1000 (this kinda sounds like dragon ball...). For this company to be priced, it has to sell 1000 thousand cars for every car they sell, or the same car but 1000 thousand times more expensive.   There is no fucking way this company isn't highly overvalued. The only thing that keeps its value high is people who think the same you think, they all are paying for something that in reality would never make the benefits they are paying for... the price keeps rising because people keeps paying more and more for something that people see as valuable only because other people are paying more and more... Do you think this will keep on forever? Do you think this situation is safe? Even Musk himself thinks the stocks are too high, it's ridiculous. It's not very different from what happened with .coms in the past. One bad new. One good new from the competitor. The stock geting to the limit and starting to stop growing or even falling a little making people start fearing and sell... and the same chain that keeps this going up, will make it go down, but faster.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 02:36:26'] I bought TSLA in March expecting it to do well but I never guessed it would be suddenly S&P 500 and 7th richest man well. I believe in their business model, the hardware, the demand, the man, the need for competition and a belief in grassroots technology and capitalism in general. Tesla should be seen as everything good that capitalism can be right now and how important it is that companies pay attention to what consumers want and not just bean count like GM and Chrysler.I never get tired of my gut being right about these sort of things, but at least this time I actually capitalized on it. I'm new to stocks so I'm not sure if this is the time to actually sell now that the results are in and the stocks gone up and I don't know what else it's going to do.

POST_TEXT: b"Tesla's market share is going to continue to drop over the next decade, which will end with them being just another automaker. They develop no other significant sources of earnings, as energy companies will demand (collude with governments to) owning the charging station infrstraucture. TSLA margins will continue to go up, but their sales will slide continuously, as the EV market evolves into just, the auto market. In 10 years, every automaker will be/is an EV maker. Agree? Disagree?"
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 19:47:57'] !remindMe 10 years
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 16:08:41'] Purely from the automotive side, I think the argument would be that total EV market will grow massively so even if Tesla loses their % domination of the EV market they will still grow both their top and bottom lines
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 16:17:29'] There is a reason automotive stocks used to trade where they did.. unions, recalls, and sales to get market share.  Detroit is an epic reminder.  Best thing about Tesla is high end consumer market share and circumventing decades of lawsuits about right to repair and aftermarket parts products, but volume sales is tricky business.  Imagine if your own personal car could only be repaired by the dealer and could only be fixed using dealer parts? If they went full subscription/lease long term maybe it would hold, but without subsidies and this legal loophole they currently enjoy they are screwed IMO
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 16:34:49'] I agree, and the stock price has years of perfection already priced in
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 15:46:33'] Tesla isn't just some EV maker.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 16:10:45'] Agree.  I think their sales will continue to increase over the next few years, but there will be a point where they level off.  In much less than 10 years they will no longer be special.  I‚Äôd say ‚Äò25 is when the EV market finally has a healthy amount of choice for the consumer, and there will be more people buying other makes than there will be people buying Teslas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 17:30:55'] Agree, already sold all my TSLA last year.  Current valuation has continued EV market domination priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 17:51:24'] Your fallacy is assuming all legacy automakers will be able to survive the next decade competing against Tesla‚Äôs production scale and efficiency. How will these legacy automakers transition to EV, while forgoing their current cash cow which is already at a laughable margin, ICE quickly becoming obsolete. How will Ford and GMs of the world carry on their union and dealership structure that just eats away their margins? These guys are already carrying a massive debt, and it will only get worse as they try to scale into EV.  EV and ICE are mutually exclusive imo, you can‚Äôt just apply the logic that the current market share of ICE will transition into EV and eat away Tesla‚Äôs shares. According to the perma bears, competition has been coming to Tesla for the past decade‚Ä¶GM literally delivered 26 EVs in the last quarter‚Ä¶lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-21 18:35:55'] The biggest issue I have is the build quality of their vehicles is shaky to poor. There is currently no indication Tesla will fix this.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 02:44:32'] They are not a car company, they are a technology company. Their car sales volume and margin per car simply do not justify market cap. So there is some other promise in their technology (that I neither see, understand, or believe in) priming them for the future. When all Fords, VWs, Audis, etc sales are EV, I don‚Äôt see Tesla cars being any big deal, certainly not a company valuation worth more than all the others combined are worth.

Musk is on the spectrum, so he‚Äôs probably obsessed/compelled to make his shit work the way he wants. It‚Äôs a misfire in his mind that he needs things to go a certain way. He may be one of these dudes that is a savant and can‚Äôt handle failure.With his resources and ideas, this dude definitely will do something innovative in the future.

It is a national champion, protected by powerful political insiders, for the dual purpose of capturing top of the value-chain and for funding a military LEO project.  Musk is borrowing against his TSLA stock to fund his rocket company, which is all about putting LEOs in space to provide tracking and targeting against Russian hypersonic missiles.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-14 15:34:33'] Right away you're suggesting to buy puts while the IV is high, you really shouldn't do that. IV crush will, you know,  crush you. There is very little evidence that the price is going to move downward enough to actually make much money and the downside risk is massive. Sell leap puts instead, I sold one last week and collected 27k in premium which I can buy shares with and ride the pop when he done selling.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-14 17:24:55'] Listen buddy I think TSLA is completely disconnected and should be nowhere near where its at. But by no means I think you should short. Literally the best thing to do with Tesla is do nothing. Listen to the magic conch shell. Don‚Äôt buy and dont short. This stock is basically the wild west of the market and Wall Street and Reddit loves to play games with this stock. Your betting this negative news is going to have an effect on the stock while in the past Tesla has typically not gone down on negative news and rather tends to overreact on positive news. I would not short this thing. Its basically a huge gamble at that point.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-14 21:15:03'] Elon has until August 2022 to sell the shares. So, no one really knows when he's gonna be done with it.

He has up to then to sell the stocks. Nothing forces him to to continue selling now. He could let the stocks rebound this week and continue next week, he could continue next month.Don't try to time the market, you will likely lose.Personally, I don't own Tesla shares, not puts and even if the stock drops back to 700-800 I would still think twice if I want to buy.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-11 22:55:30'] The way this is calculated by the way is taking the premium attached to at the money call and put options at the ask for the expiration next Friday. This is then added to the current stock price and then subtracted to come up with the weekly risk range. Generally if we fall out of this range you can consider us to be oversold or overbought. If we hit the upper or lower risk ranges at the start of the week it could set up nicely for a good risk to reward trade for the opposite direction. When important macro news occurs like Fridays poor Cpi print, you can see big deviations away from these ranges.

POST_TEXT: b'Electric-vehicle startup Rivian (RIVN) has roared into public markets with a killer public offering and a market value of $116 billion. Thats 32% more than General Motors (GM) is worth, and 47% more than Ford (F). Rivian has never sold a vehicle until this year. GM sells around 7 million vehicles per year; Ford, 4 million.\n\nIf you add up the market value of Tesla (TSLA), Rivian, and 5 other startups including Lucid (LCID), Nikola (NKLA), Fisker (FSR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE) and Workhorse (WKHS), their combined capitalization is nearly $1.3 trillion. Nine of the worlds biggest automakersGM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler-Benzare only worth $845 billion.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 17:31:08'] Rivian is definitely overvalued!  I‚Äôm not buying it.  Tesla is the leader and will remain the EV leader.  I think Ford will be very successful with its EV vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 17:20:34'] People who decry valuations based on cars sold have a pretty thick blind spot for debt, margins, and regulatory requirements.Ford‚Äôs debt is equal to $900 dollars for every man woman and child in the US. Most other legacy companies are in a similar position. I read today that Volkswagen has a $40 billion dollar shortfall in their pension system. Tesla has paid of its small debts early, and largely finances its projects from sales rather then debt.Tesla‚Äôs new factory is projected to make a car three times faster, cheaper, with higher specs, and a higher sales price than Volkswagen‚Äôs model factories in Wolfsburg and Saxony.It‚Äôs no coincidence that the Ford CEO‚Äôs recent admission that Tesla was the leader in terms of manufacturing, profit, and product mentioned specifically that they were unencumbered by the franchise dealer network. Car dealers have been very activist lobbyists since Tesla committed to the direct sales model. The result is that all large manufacturers are legally trapped in a dealer model that turns of customers and sucks profit from their already razor thin margins. The law only applies to legacy companies, and start ups, such as rivian, are free to sell directly.Would I buy Rivian? No, you‚Äôre correct that they are over valued, but I am expecting one of their trucks in my driveway in the coming months. comparing GM or Honda, etc to Rivian and/or Tesla is not a direct comparison. One business controls their entire distribution network, the other doesn‚Äôt. One business can build enough cars to meet demand, the other regularly has to cut shifts or push incentives due to overcapacity. One has pricing power, the other regularly sells cars at a loss. Volume is not a good indicator of health in the auto sector.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 20:51:18'] Don‚Äôt group Tesla with other EV makers. Tesla has proven itself and has a clear path to selling 10M cars with insane gross margins justifying its valuation. The other EVs still need to prove they won‚Äôt go broke.You could also make the same argument with just Tesla alone because it is 90% of the total EV market cap.  Grouping other EV super speculative plays just obfuscate your point.

That can be overcome with a massive battery, lowering  production volumes and profit margins.  However the delayed cyber truck with its exoskeleton shell, aerodynamic design and more energy dense 4680 batteries will likely be significantly more efficient than body on frame gas truck designs....and as the  the real battle will be in battery production Tesla looks to be setting themselves up to win the long game.

GM to me is the pick a lot of people have. But them getting bails out and bankrupt in 08/09 makes me not like them. Also they don't really have an EV on the streets. Ford at least has Mach E. Also F150 lightning will probably be out 2022.Rivian has big backers of Amazon and Ford. Ford production insight. Amazon for tech and money. Jeff Bezos has competition with Musk.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 07:53:50'] This rumour is way off the mark.  This is more  likely all the funds that had to offload stocks of the other companies that are removed and add Tsla to its portfolios since its now going to be a part of S&P500.  I mean this happens every time they rejig the S&P500, when they remove and add companies that it tracks.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 17:15:56'] The electrek site includes a 'Tesla shop'So they are likely a biased source of info.I find the money flow interesting.  The total value of the S&P500 is 23 Tril.  Right now TSLA is about the value of J&J (surprised?).  J&J has 1.3% of the index.  23,000 bil x 0.013 = 299 billion.  The current market cap of TSLA is 461 Bil.  \[(461+299)/461\]x$499\_per\_share = price rise to $823/share due to new buying demand.. if volumes of sellers remained the same.  However, if TSLA ever went to $823, for sure (opinion) everyone holding the stock outside the index funds would sell.  So there is a balance here.  A company can be added to an index and have $299 bil of new demand, but all that needs to happen is they find a price where people will sell them the $299 bil 's worth.  In the end, nothing about the company changes.  A price to sales that is 16x the other significant auto makers (taking Toyota for example which is price to sales of about 1.0)  is still defying adjectives.  A book by Shaughnessy studied 40 years of stock market data and found that a price to sales of <1.5 is considered a good deal.  TSLA price to sales is 16.4 at least check at Reuters.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 11:37:18'] I sold today. TSLA 500. Now, time to short the market!
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-19 07:28:22'] Sigh of course TSLA soars to the moon right after I sold at a small profit once the stock dropped immediately after being announced on the S&P.Now it's hit $505 for the first time ever. It literally peaked today. That's INSANE.Nobody buys this stock with their head anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 09:10:40'] You did well. $1994/$18450(paid price)=10.8% rtn. This is a lot more than avg cc sellers earned with other stocks.If I sell an index like SPY for same week or fraction a week, I often lose more than gained simply I can not anticipate future.  Stocks I sell cc my cost basis price has to be  below the trading range.  If I sell your TSLA at 160 and get reassigned I  lose more than the intend use the premium for a source of income.   Not sure about you, I often forget to check cc such as having stocks exercised.  If trade in a taxable account one has to pay capital gain tax.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 09:53:46'] There's different strategies but I wouldn't have realised that loss and just let myself get exercised. Sure you can compare the price you get called at to the share price at the time and consider that delta loss but it's not actual loss so long as the strikes you sell at are above your cost basis. You're doing half of wheeling. As you aren't selling naked/poor man's why not do the full thing?If you get called and you still like the stock to play with but you aren't happy with the current price just sell a cash secured put instead to where you are happy with an appropriate delta. Plenty of examples and tutorials on wheeling out there.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 10:58:50'] I‚Äôve read 3rd and 5th editions of Macmillan‚Äôs ‚ÄúOptions as a strategic investment‚Äú several times. Highly recommend.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 11:46:31'] Theta gang bruhAnd you‚Äôre selling weeklies in tesla so you gotta expect regular wild ass moves that are either gonna print nicely or get your stock pulled away and you feeling bitter.Also you‚Äôre rolling mechanically it seems.Perhaps for further out: 30-60 days, for example, or be more judicious when you sell, or how quickly you buy them back.Or switch your underlying
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 10:11:30'] If allowed in your account sell cash secured puts fir a strike below the call strike and if hit you buy at that strike - this will put hold on funds aqualling the put strike so you would need in this case 18000 for share buy and sell covered call + 18000 for additional on hold (tied up) for assignment if hit. The call wouldn't be excersized if put strike is hit so it is possible that you would end up with 200 shares unless you buy the put back for a loss - this is a full wheel turning strategy - also there is nothing wrong with allowing your calls to be pulled away and with tsla uts easy to sell above your input cost instead of base cost this makes a profit most times
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 12:04:32'] You should definitely note your delta of your strike to help really encapsulate your setup when describing things imo.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 20:50:49'] Personally, if your not looking to hold your stocks long term.  You said your focusing on high volatility stocks. So it sounds like your trading them and not investing them.  I would not do this strategy. The risk is the stock you pick tanks.  Personally if I were selling calls, I would still pick stocks that pay a dividend and sell 1 month out. Sell the call and then hold even if it goes past your strike and your option gets exercised. You still make a profit on your shares plus keep all the premium.  And if the stock drops, you keep your premium and if you hold longer term as you wait for the stock to rise, you get dividends. Example. A stock is $100. Pays 2% dividends.  You sell a 105C for 1.00. If it goes to 110, you still make $5 a share plus keep the $100 from your 1.00 credit. And if the stock falls to $90 you keep your 100 for your 1.00 and you get 2% dividend if it stays low for long enough.  And just keep doing that. Yes, if the stock keeps falling the 105 strike will be less, say 0.80. But after a few months you could then lower your strike to the 100 where you originally bought in. If it hits, then your still in profit because you would have collected a few months of expired credit and maybe some dividend funds also.  Just pick a company your comfortable holding long term if needed.

Long enough time line your premiums from calls should start to close in on your base costs and that is where you can start to really get bold cause it is really all gravy at that point the stock could go to 0 and you still already covered your initial costs

I was selling calls of stocks that barely moved like Verizon and ATT and even PLTR was good. but now I am down like 40% of all of those positions so I cant really sell calls on them. Here is my dream scenario with PLTRI load up tons and tons of shares at 10 average. Over next 3 years the stock rockets to 70. I am now selling 75 calls and even if it runs and gets called away I am making all that profit. Again, hopefully I have a few thousand shares and plan to stack them. lets say 5k shares. I sell 1k at 75 and 1k at 78 and 1k at 80/82... Even if it hit the 75 I am only selling 20% of my bag and lets face it at some point we have to take some profits..
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 17:21:27'] If you are a glutton for premium you can switch over to futures options. Very different ballgame but the benefit is the free leverage. Premiums are much better but you have to keep in mind everything that goes with futures contracts.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 16:45:05'] I was always wonder WTH Gates was thinking when he made that public comment. He was clearly already wrong on why electric trucks won't work. A lot of prominent businesses, including Walmart's Canadian division (where the cold weather should make it harder for electric trucks to be viable) have pre-ordered a bunch of Tesla Semi's because they did the research and found it both works and makes sense.You can still debate today if electric planes will ever work or not. For now they're currently impossible with today's battery technology (the batteries are just too heavy and don't have enough juice), but that doesn't mean that new technology & improvements to existing technology won't make it viable overtime.I suppose a short position could explain why Gates made such an obviously wrong comment on electric trucks, but I'm not sure I really buy that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 22:11:24'] So where are those semi trucks?  Right, musk abandoned those to "focus on cars".   Yet he promised to have them on roads by now.  Robotaxis were also to be here by now.  Not to mention his million mile battery.  Hmm what else.  Ahh the solar roof which was promised to be same.cost as regular roof.  That roof was promised to be out 2yrs ago.   Oh and full self driving?  That was also promised to be here 2yrs ago.  What else?  Hmm no secondary offerings.  Well we know how man offering tesla has done.Dont get me wrong I invested in musk's ability to bs and sell people on a dream and release BS news via Twitter just at the right times to punish shorts but it may be time to exit tesla as he cant pump when every other manufacturer will have and has EVs out.If anyone cares Musk got over 500m from tax payers that saved tesla amd over 1.5b from gov for spacex.  Both loans were extended just as both companies neared bankruptcy.  This is Elon Musk.  100% funded by socialist gov programs.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-13 08:34:05'] I think what gates likely meant, was that even though electric vehicles have proven to be more environmentally friendly, they're all front loaded, meaning that the batteries are actually pretty bad for the environment, and there's more emerging tech that will likely replace them. Off the top of my head are solid state batteries, and then there's hydrogen fuel.  EDIT: My point is that I'm sure Bill Gates knows that Tesla has working vehicles lol

I'm imagining Tesla blowing up not because people like the product, but because they wanted to fuck over Gates or whoever had the shorts. Elon saying this is in and of itself a game. I think the Gamespot fiasco may have reveal more publicly that things like this might be more true than not. It falls in line with most billionaires being quite private.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 07:49:40'] As somebody who has been watching on the sidelines with Tesla for years I can tell you honestly there is always, always - countless bear cases and negative predictions for the stock. Today, at 835 I opened my first ever long term position in my ISA and I‚Äôll be looking to build it moving forward.I‚Äôm basing this not on its current valuation - which is obviously mental, but on the last earnings report in tandem with the sheer amount I am seeing on the streets of London, England where I live. All of a sudden there has been an EXPLOSION of Tesla‚Äôs.. all 21/22 plates. As if a shed load of orders have been fulfilled - it‚Äôs obvious the demand it insane and I‚Äôm ready to be onboard the Tesla train.. Just my two cents.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 07:25:02'] Either Elon is selling again, or the suits are trying to force the Twitter deal into not happening by pressing down on shorts (they're at least frontrunning possible sells by shorting).It could be as simple as nothing is going on here, but the price action here is just too familiar. It reminds me of when he was selling Tesla late last year.

Why did you buy in the first place to begin with then? Bears have been screaming this stock goes to anywhere between 10 and 500 dollar quarter after quarter, thats nothing new..
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 10:00:28'] The stock has never been cheaper from the standpoint of fundamentals.  IMO , there is very little that is forseeable that is standing in the way of 50% growth over at least the next two years, and probably close to to that for the next 5 years.  And this is assuming they don't figure out FSD and the Tesla bot doesn't go anywhere.  This is just based on car production alone.  Demand is not an issue.  Based on Q1 earnings and a presumed 50% growth rate, your 2024 PE is gonna be around 20.  IMO, the stock is cheap.  Those who disagree simply don't believe in the business, or at least don't believe it will grow at the rate that most TSLA investors think is close to locked in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 19:31:32'] Hold
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 21:34:53'] Reading your other responses, you should probably diversify? That said, you could check to see if using a put option to protect against a crash until you reach long term gains threshold could potentially be cheaper than the tax bill. This assumes you have at least 100 shares, which might be ambitious.e.g. an at the money put option for 200 days is about 10% of the price of the stock; might be worth it if it saves you over 10% in taxes. (Of course, you also give up the opportunity cost of investing in something different.)If you don't have cash handy, you could sell a call on the stock and use that money to buy a put, this is called a "costless collar" and can lock your profit for a while.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 22:46:22'] If you want to invest for the long term, your better off putting it into an index fund like the S&P 500.  It will let you have a tiny piece of the top 500 stocks in america, and it is a much safer bet than individually picking stocks.  When people individually pick stocks, 9/10 they end up performing less than if they just put their money in the SP500.   This even goes for economic professionals (see Jim Cramer lol).  I would also recommend putting some into the international fund, that way you aren't putting all your bets into the United States.  In the future, India may become an economic world superpower.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 18:35:40'] Microvast for me is what I have most of my money in. They are a very quickly expanding USA battery manufacturer with a MC ($393) of less than cash on hand ($500m) and what I estimate will do $400m+ in revenue next this year (200-250m projected for 2022). Got a factory in Tennessee that is starting cell production this year to fulfill a $330m order for a 1.2GWh BESS order. Also will qualify for the IRA stipend of $45k/kWh since we do both cells (35k) + packs (10k). We expect over $1.5-2 Billion long term from the IRA just with the one USA factory. Oh and the DOE gave us a $200m grant to build a separator factory in partnership with G fucking M (General Motors). To help them fulfill their performance and safety goals, especially in their Ultium line of cells (think premium). We also are the sole cell supplier for Iveco‚Äôs new eDaily van‚Ä¶ an electric version of Iveco‚Äôs normal (gas powered) eDaily‚Ä¶ the most popular ($$$) commercial van in all of Europe. Anyways check back in with me in 2025 and 2030‚Ä¶ things will be different

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:38:16'] 46% is in US index ETFs (VOO, VTI and QQQ are almost identical but I don't mind the "diversification" in management and a little bit of mid small cap).I'm not gonna judge the individual stocks. We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think "gambling" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.If you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.I think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important.

I think we are indeed in a world where the winners take most and you made a good decision with nvidia, Tesla, and Google.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-27 13:00:47'] Highly unlikely. These guys have been around since 2013 under a different name and they are just making cooling hardware with a few sensors. Kind of like coolers for computers and such. Odds are, their only customers will be applications where cooling devices are not readily available. So custom jobs basically. Government work or perhaps prototypes and such.My guess is every eV maker already has something similar. I would be totally shocked if they didnt.That said they are in my backyard (San Diego) so I wish them the best ;-)

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 05:28:32'] Someone who works at Tesla (cant remember his name :) ).  Tweeted out that it was over priced at 800.    Now here we are.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 08:15:41'] NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE: I heard an extremely knowledgeable and experienced investor say the following when TSLA was at $250/share: " TSLA has had a virtual monopoly on the government subsidized luxury electric vehicle market for years and during all that time has not been able to turn a profit.  What do you think is going to happen when they lose government subsidies and/or have a competitor?"  Those quote marks are to denote that those are the words of someone else, but I typed them from memory so that is a paraphrased quote...My point is that very smart people could articulate an extremely bearish case for the stock at almost any price point and have thus far been wrong.  IMO, there is absolutely no way to do fundamental anaylsis on the stock.  Here is another quote, I forget who said it, maybe Buffett:  " A stock is only priced correctly twice.  Once on the way up and once on the way back down".
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 04:07:49'] People have been saying it‚Äôs over priced since 500+ then the first big spike happened ($800+) everyone went nuts. Logic has been thrown out the window a long time ago for $TSLA that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not touching it. The fan base is a practically a cult. It‚Äôs no doubt a bubble, but the crazy followers are what keeps it afloat. So if it‚Äôs gonna pop any time soon, that‚Äôs the real question.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:31:59'] TSLA is racing upwards from buying pressure due to S&P 500 addition and a gamma squeeze. While the price is definitely getting way ahead of itself, it may cause a reset of market expectations and outlook on Tesla that will cause the stock to stay elevated unless Tesla fails to execute. The key with Tesla is to either be long the stock or not long the stock. Do not ever short it in any way on valuation concerns or competition concerns or anything else really, they‚Äôre bogeymen and you are likely to lose money. Shorting Tesla is for degenerates who hate money

It simply just doesn't add up anymore, when are people going to stop judging this stock based on technicals? It doesn't and won't work.  I believe TSLA has insane potential and noone comes even close to what they are achieving in such a short time frame. I guess many are realizing this and do not matter to pay a premium for TSLA's insane future potential. Either you hang in for the long haul or let this stock go, there are many more stable and reliable stocks to focus on if you are looking to trade based on technicals.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:01:47'] Don't waste your time doing TA on Tesla. People are considering it a tech stock more than a profitable car manufacturer. There is much speculation what Tesla could bring in the future which drives the price up, innovative batteries, the driving AI which is miles ahead of the rest could lead to automated taxis etc. Also the cult behind Tesla and the belief in Elon is really driving this, although his memeish behaviour he tends to deliver on his goals i.e spaceX success is huge PR for them. I don't see this popping unless their r&d slows down or other EV start ups like Nio can challenge them, or the big boy manufacturers start to catch them up. I think the latter is likely as the majority of western countries and some Asian are banning the production of petrol powered cars in the next couple of decades.Just my opinion.. I don't hold any positions on Tesla, fuck that.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:51:01'] I was thinking the same thing, but then I thought:* Tesla‚Äôs market cap is currently ~260B* Microsoft, Apple, Amazon have market caps above 1T (or around that)* *If* Tesla succeeds in creating cars as a service (and I think that is a goal for them), their market is at least as large as the market for iPhones, Office, etc., and maybe even more profitable.So maybe it‚Äôs not a bubble but a very positive pricing on future earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:14:15'] In my opinion, I do not see it popping anytime soon. The following base is too strong and the shorts are reducing over time because people are not willing to bet against the company as they once did before. This stock is really weird and I can foresee TSLA surpass $2000 soon. As I bought in some more at 1650, it was currently at 1777 when I was typing this. I feel like if it were to pop, it would have to be really bad news but TSLA has been releasing some great news as of late.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:14:34'] My opinion is that I'm sick to my stomach for not buying as much as i could at 500 a share like I heavily considered :(

Hell, even I thought the short squeeze at 800-900 was it. Then it just kept going. It doesn't follow fundamentals but more sentiment and future outlook and that latter part is looking very juicy right now. Level 5 autonomous driving, s&p 500, better battery tech, lots to look forward to. I'm up over 100% on my shares now but I don't plan on selling.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 15:30:36'] It's a bubble for a simple fact that in the end it's still a automobile stock, not a tech stock. The difference is the size of the available market for your business, as well as profit margins. In the end, TSLA is still selling cars and has never made a profit, and in all honesty doesn't look like it will. Compare that to Toyota (the cars on the road, production capacity, variety across price ranges to appeal a wider market) and you'll know that it's unbelievably inflated. However, that doesn't mean the stock will not soar at least in coming weeks. What matters is what the traders think of it from a stock price point of view. But either way sooner or later, I see it dropping to 300$ (2 year outlook). Would NOT invest. Trade? Maybe, if I'm feeling lucky. Any thoughts about NIO?

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 08:23:58'] People are still thinking of Tesla as a power company or as as car company. They are not. They are a software company and they are miles and years ahead of any 'competition'. If another company wants to get on their level, they're either going to have to put in the years of work or they're going to have to license the software from Tesla. At that point, Tesla can literally print money.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 04:51:16'] Long story short, if Tesla ends up creating FSD, Tesla would be worth at least a trillion dollars. Right now Tesla is worth like 280 billion, because, to many people, Tesla is the frontrunner in terms of FSD technology, software and hardware. I think Waymo was worth around that as well a year ago. People who say Tesla is a bubble probably think that Tesla is just a carmanufactor and also think Apple, Amazon etc. was a bubble as well back in the time.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:37:58'] Real question...does anyone here believe that retail investors are pushing TSLA stock price to where we‚Äôre at?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:45:03'] Nothing makes sense right now, its .01 percent hedge funds making moves that own half the market.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:12:49'] I think it's definitely overvalued, but I think it will either drop hard or stay around its price for 10-20 years. I can see an actual price of 1600 in 20 years, but now it's way overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:12:50'] Research arks investments price targets for Tesla long term and you‚Äôll see the bubble has only begun lol
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:14:08'] it's up to 1700 now.i had 2 shares that i bought at 800 each. i actually ended up selling one today because the valuation is SO high. my logic is that by selling one of my shares now, i have recouped 100% of the cost of BOTH my shares (plus a slim profit). tesla could go bankrupt tomorrow getting me $0 from my other share and i will have still gained from my initial investment. they won't go bankrupt though, and whatever happens with my 2nd share is pure profit at this point.what i'm hoping is that it is a bubble, it pops, and i can get more at the 800-1k range and hold until these 1700+ evaluations make sense. (but if that doesn't happen and it keeps rocketing, i still have 1 share)
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:32:28'] is there any way to know how much TSLA is being bought via fractional shares? wondering how much of an effect that could have on pushing stock price up and up b/c it‚Äôs shielding actual buyers from real cost
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:33:16'] Momentum momentum... Tesla has massive amounts of it, Tesla wont just drop out of nowhere it will gradually drop like it did in February.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:48:18'] Even Elon said TSLA is overly priced when it was $800, few months ago. As long as there are buyers, you are ok. You should not be the last buyer.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:54:02'] I believe that in the long run Tesla is going to be BIG, but at the moment Tesla is way overpriced and is not going to be a good investment in the short term. I think it will probably crash, but in the long run will have greatly benefitted from its bubble days when it had plenty of money to invest in its business.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:54:27'] yes it will crash...but it couid run to 10000 first

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 08:05:57'] $TSLA 5000 end of year
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 08:06:31'] The current market is understandable to me, at least for 7 out of ten. Right now wealthy people are putting their money in the market like they would a bank or CD because of the rapid inflation that is on the horizon. It is because of this that right now things aren't paying high interest on money held, as well as the government. So what these wealthy people can make in the market is much higher then if they just stored their money like usual. But they are going for the companies that are good but cheaper rather than excellent and expensive driving that pretty up on these companies. So not a bubble because there won't be a pop and crash. More of a quick depreciation to actually value which will be higher but not as high. Not to mention the wealthy most likely have 100k or more shares per portfolio. So when the actual economy turns up the stock market will dip as those people will move money back to the interest baring accounts. Basically when good interest rates return to government and private banks you pull out of the market and reposition on the fall.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 09:04:43'] Think about it this way: is Tesla a half a trillion dollar company or not? Or do you want to buy the apple of cars when in this market tsla is even more grossly unaffordable even to those with the us.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 09:21:40'] I‚Äôve thought so for weeks now. Last Wednesday Tesla dropped 5% suddenly from 1400 to 1330 while the rest of the market was green. I thought finally this bubble is popping. Welp it‚Äôs now up almost 25% since then. In just 3 days.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 12:41:24'] I sold at 1700 earlier today, I think it's way overvalued. I think if you plan on holding it for a decade you might start hitting the correct value.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 12:44:32'] Bubble indeed
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 13:01:20'] Looks like if it was, it just popped. Margin Requirements increasing to own $TSLA Options and we had a Rounded Reversal today back to 1500 from 1800.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 13:07:29'] I'm waiting for the next earnings for a huge drop, cause when it does, it's going to barrel down past 1000. I hope the company does well, I've believed in EVs for a long time, but this stock is batshit nuts.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 13:13:27'] No idea...but sure seems like it. Its parabolic! I sold today at 1700 to take profits, and I dont care if it goes more up actually, as it fluctuates so wildly. I might do options trading on this one rather than holding on. I do believe in Tesla, but again to much volatility for my taste.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 13:15:53'] Absolutely, no reason not to take advantage of it.   Just don‚Äôt get blown up in the process.  The pop will be much faster than the run up.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 14:24:11'] All I know is that I‚Äôm kicking myself for not buying it when it went sub $400 back in March.   I hesitated and it shot back up before I got another chance.  Of course, if I had it‚Äôs doubtful I woulda had the fortitude to hold it this long.  It‚Äôs definitely overpriced.  I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm an expert in Tesla valuation but I don‚Äôt really see the big deal.  They might be a front runner on electric cars at the moment but how long until Toyota, GM, etc., etc. catch up.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 17:12:17'] I want to know where you even come to the conclusion that it's worth $1000 a share. Their continued profitability is questionable and certainly not inline with a 1000 dollar valuation.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 18:00:57'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 05:45:10'] Would be interested to see the rationale behind your valuation. They're doing a lot of innovative stuff and may well unveil a level 5 fully self driving car this year which I think would justify a high valuaition.Having said that it's recently been hitting ATHs day after day and going up crazy amounts, this was clearly not sustainable. It's clearly been in a bubble which looks like it's just bursting, it was only a question of exactly when. I'll be interested to see where it bottoms.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 14:20:35'] I love Elon and all the stuff he is up to (except for going to Mars).  I understand Tesla is leading the way with electric vehicles but I just don't get the hype price wise.  How much money are they really making?  How big can Tesla really get?I look at comparable companies and the price of Tesla is insane.  Sure you can argue there are no competitive companies right now but how long until other automakers knock off the tech at half the price?I think the company is great from a technology and environmental perspective but the stock price is silly IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:43:05'] While I will say the price has grown way beyond my bullish outlook on the company, I have no doubt that Tesla will be a trillion dollar company in the next 5-10 years. The rate theyre expanding while now meeting demand faster than they originally thought, quarters are going to begin looking a lot more profitable. They are at the very least half a decade ahead of any other EV maker out there in terms of the product they offer. Call me an optimist or a fanboy, but I wouldnt be shocked if Tesla paves the way to a driver-less world taking out the many risks involved with human drivers.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 05:20:07'] Lord Elon got a plan for us all. I predict that the stock will hit 2500 in mid august and then drop to 1200, and stay at around 1000 - 1100. People will always say tesla is a bubble.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:05:59'] Long term it isn‚Äôt. Short term maybe.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:25:18'] Yes and no. Tesla could very well be a 1 trillion dollar company at one point. But that would require *everything* to go right. I think people are just getting strong Apple vibes and aren‚Äôt trying to miss out. In all reality, the major car makers are going to make solid electric cars with self driving capability. That being said, long Tesla for their batteries and not their cars.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 06:26:23'] > IMHO we are entering bubble territory.Entering??? It's been a bubble for a while. There's no rational justification for the price. Does that mean it won't keep going up? Nope. But it does mean that it's likely going to fall, and it'll fall hard, and some unfortunate people will be left holding the bag. When a stock makes a run like this and then crashes, it rarely recovers and when it does it can take a decade or more.For example, look at Cisco during the dotcom bubble. It hit $80 in March 2000 but still hasn't regained those highs after the crash. Of course, there are other examples of companies that blew away their 2000 highs long ago. AMZN, AAPL. MSFT, etc.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:45:34'] The world and many big big investors will not let TSLA go away.  Its too critical as future infrastructure, everyone else is too worried about branding instead of creating new tech.  TSLA is more an R&D company, hence the ‚Äúlosing money‚Äù, but really R&D isn‚Äôt a loss its a revenue generator for the future.All that said the stock valuation is cryptic at best.  Will all the R&D pan out to generate that revenue to give it a rational P/E and ROI?  You wont know until they are done releasing products or reduce spending on R&D.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 11:57:24'] Funny, at 1000 a few weeks ago everyone said that was the bubble. Now it‚Äôs 1600. In a few months if Tesla reaches 2k plus will 1600 be justified now üòÇ! Here‚Äôs my opinion... it‚Äôs all madness.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 07:29:56'] No it's not a bubble. It's a company that was undervalued for so long, and investors are starting to realize this. Now move on.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 05:54:52'] Traditional analysis doesnt work for some stocks.  Apple is an example.  I believe TSLA is another because speculation is exceptionally strong with this one.  I‚Äôve been trying to add more/ wait for pullback since $550, $750, $830, etc.My approach now is to dollar cost average in.  Every $400 up, I buy another share.

It‚Äôs gonna pop soon but who knows how soon.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-13 08:55:59'] If it's not a bubble then IDK what is.. on the other hand I'm still holding. Im guessing younger users flooding the market through RH. The thing is I dont see RH slowing down in the near-near future, and if anything once companies like Square release a competing platform it will prob keep the momentum. So the question is 1) when will we reach saturation with the growth of RH, at least in the near term and 2) can TSLA, who is undeniably brilliant, make use of the growth to sustain and justify it.  I actually have a question for someone who can educate me-   How does TSLA benefit form the growth of their market cap?   Like, if they go to 350B from 175B, do they now have (roughly) double the ability to invest in R&D or explore new markets? Or is this just some number that represents what ppl think of them but which they have no ability to use to fund business execution..   It's a fundamental concept but one I dont fully understand about stocks in general. If ppl can also provide keywords or resources to research into this I would greatly appreciate!

You probably don't have that level of understanding for 10-20 companies.So the question is: do you understand the company you hold better than the market? If so, then what you are doing is ok.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:19:30'] It wasn't 45% when he bought it, it grew to become 45%. To sell now would be a waste since he'd have to pay taxes and find a new place to put the money. Warren won't sell until he thinks Apple is no longer a good holding or if he needs the money for something else (unlikely as Berk has a ton of cash).
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:00:10'] It is risky. But Buffett and Munger have run concentrated portfolios before. GEICO used to be over 50% of Buffett's net worth. The actual risk is dependent on their analysis of AAPL. Warren seems confident in the investment, often talks about how he wishes they could own the whole company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:57:39'] If you have something that you think is the best thing that could possibly exist, would you sell it and buy something else? Everything else despite exhaustive research is inferior, so what would you do with the money? Berkshire has exceptional profit in this business and they‚Äôre raking in mega dividends amd getting huge returns. Don‚Äôt pull your flowers to water your weeds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:16:26'] Personally, I am totally for globally diversified and factor ETFs with regular rebalancing.But half my net worth is in a single company as I bought it for cheap and had enormous gains. Even now, I think I will "never" sell it. and I still read and watch every single detail about it. Either you stockpick like Buffet and put the work into it. Or you diversify via ETFs. But if you own 20 or so stocks, you just as well can go for the ETF.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 20:59:26'] Buffet and Munger have both said they don't believe in diversification. They'd have gone over 100% in one company at times if it was possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:33:55'] Because WB generally owns enough equity in these businesses that he can exert some control over them - Berkshire Hathaway acts kind of like a publicly traded PE firm.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:57:03'] Find advice from credible resources to learn how to invest in your tax bracket or hire a financial advisor.  The advice these moguls give only really works when you have a lot of money like them.  I had all my money in 1 stock from 2020-Now and have seen a greater ROI than I probably would‚Äôve gotten investing only 15% max in blue chip stocks during the same time period.  I risked it all and it‚Äôs paid off so far.  You need to grow your money to throw your money.  There are 2 types of investors, those who risk it all to get to the top and those who steadily climb their way there.  Both are respectable paths to financial security and you have to figure out which one you‚Äôre more comfortable doing.  The best decision is an informed decision.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:07:54'] For your average investor it‚Äôs risky. For Warren Buffet, Charles Munger, and the leadership team they‚Äôve built to take over after they‚Äôre gone, it‚Äôs a calculated risk. Based on whatever analysis they‚Äôve run, a 45% concentration is an acceptable risk adjusted return

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 10:46:47'] Many retail investors are exposed to dangers that they either ignore or misunderstand, or they overestimate their own knowledge and competence. They rely too much on mathematical formulas and too little on sound judgment in their own emotional biases. This leads them to buy high-grade stocks at very high prices when the market and the economy are booming, and to sell them at very low prices when the market and the economy are depressed. They do not appraise the intrinsic value of the stocks before buying or selling them, but rather follow their whims and biases. They will twist or disregard any factor to make the stocks appear cheap or expensive, such as using a higher or lower interest rate, projecting a faster or slower growth rate, or anything else that justifies their wish to buy or sell the stock. That's the face of fundamental analysis in retail domain.The main lesson is: spread your portfolio among 20 to 30 stocks and avoid extreme actions

If this is true, it was a campaign that was deliberately misleading for consumers like myself. When I bought the car, was told by Tesla employees, backed by Musk‚Äôs public statements, that this self-driving technology was imminent. The video was their main sales pitch. It‚Äôs now 2023, I still have the car, it‚Äôs in the self driving ‚ÄúBeta,‚Äù and it is laughably incapable of managing mundane driving complications. I feel foolish, but it also appears I was deliberately misled. Carmakers shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to deliberately misled consumers.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 06:59:22'] Elon has said multiple times that their self driving tech is what makes them special, and is what makes Tesla so valuable. More valuable than all the other auto manufacturers in the world, including the ones that sell more cars and make more profit. We've reached the point where those competitors have matched or passed their tech. Mercedes is the first to sell a car internationally certified for level 3 self driving and is building a billion dollar EV charging network. Even Subaru has matched Tesla at Level 2 with their EyeSight system, already in use in over a million cars. Basically every major manufacturer has promised to deliver Level 3 or higher in the next few years.With Tesla following instead of leading at this point, and missing deadlines by years being commonplace, I really do think their perceived value will start to drop.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 15:33:33'] Tesla deserves this. I can't believe how stupid and irresponsible their marketing team was. When news about Teslas crashing because of distracted drivers came out, my dad and I talked about how completely misleading it was to market their vehicles as being "self-driving" or having an "autopilot" feature. Sure, [from an engineering perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot) "autopilot" technically means some level of human piloting is still occurring...but to the average layperson, the word colloquially implies that the machine doesn't need to be supervised (i.e. saying that someone is "operating on autopilot" means that they're distracted).Even if the engineers had wanted to call it an "autopilot" feature, the marketers and lawyers should have stepped in and overridden them. I normally argue that consumers should be responsible for understanding what they're buying, but I can absolutely understand why someone would purchase a car and assume that the car was totally autonomous. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them assumed that the instructions that did warn them to pay attention to the road were just legalese to cover Tesla's ass instead of serious warnings.

POST_TEXT: b'First off. Lmao. Cant tell you how many times Ive been called a boomer for avoiding TSLA and NIO. For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. \n\nIts times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. \n\n- Ask yourself what youve learned about your risk tolerance. \n\n- Ask yourself what lessons youve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. \n\nWhen the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people dont know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of yall. Yall bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; yall dont know what to do, so you panic and then sell. \n\nAbout a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai \n\nhttps://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-'
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 13:57:22'] It is a lot easier when you‚Äôve held a stock for years and are up big versus a short term holding that has tanked. I bought TSLA around 6 years ago, have recouped my initial investment 8x over and the shares I do currently have are at a $50 cost basis. It would take a massive collapse for me to be in the red on the TSLA shares I have and even if that happens, I‚Äôve profited so much that I wouldn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm playing with house money at this point.It is a completely different situation with stocks that I have purchased recently, like in the last 3 months. My thesis for getting into these positions has not had the time to play out at all and I have some FUD about whether they will or not. I believe I made good calls on all these positions, but until they have the time to mature, it is hard to stop second guessing. Basically, it‚Äôs easy for an investor with substantial time in the market that has banked good profits to sit there and criticize. Being new to the market or even having new positions can be nerve wracking.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 12:40:13'] I keep telling myself that the companies I have chosen to invest in are good buys. I still believe that the companies I have shares are good! It sucks seeing red over and over, of course. I actually find it easier though when I go and look at all the other companies like top 100 or whatever and see the exact same pattern on everything. Makes it easier knowing it isn't personal and everyone is in this shit filled boat. It will return, pandemic still hitting hard, and stimulus around the corner. A golden age is coming soon I can feel it. Always darkest before dawn or some bs proverb like that. Thanks for post OP it did help.

I learnt much about the market and my own risk tolerance level. Sometimes the loses early on are a gift !
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 12:12:00'] It sucks but so long as you‚Äôre in companies who don‚Äôt base their value off of sales in the next 5 years, I think people would be wiser simply holding through this.I remember a post weeks ago calling new investors basically dumb for worrying about a couple red days when we finally hit a rare green day, but low and behold look where we are now haha.

Then we had the Mar 2020 crash, but today Tencent is at 693HKD even after the recent 2 weeks of red.If you believe in the company, just hold or DCA.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 12:51:15'] Being right about the next trend is not the key to great investing.   There is no doubt that EVs and autonomous driving is the next great thing.   But buying at a valuation that TSLA could not hold if it sold 25% of the autos on the road does not work.People understand that Amazon is a great company.   They forget it sold around $100/share in 1999 and sold for $6/share in 2002, and now sells over $3000/share.   The people buying in 1999 were spot on right about the company but grossly wrong about the price.  In fact AMZN didn't again hit a $100/sh until 2010, so they lost money for 11 years if they were foolish enough to hold that long but 99% sold in the single digits or teens.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 13:38:56'] I started in 2020 two weeks before the crash. The first thing I've experienced in investing is one of the hardest and fastest crashs in history. I wasn't really impressed by declining numbers, I just didn't know how to behave in a crash. If I hadn't hesitated I could have bought Tesla at the absolute bottom. Next time I know better. My cost averaging plan is still running with Tesla at its top. Their innovations are years ahead and I don't really care about the immediate numbers.I guess years of gaming make me feel like this is just another game where you have to exploit the rules. Seeing red and buying more is part of that exploit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 20:03:05'] I bought April $45 calls for NIO and if it dips below 40 I'm buying another 3.5k in shares. This is some of the easiest money on the market and Im not really a fan of electrical vehicles overall.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 22:17:46'] I think the whole psychology of risk tolerance is super super interesting and definitely something that should be studied but this NIO situation is super interesting for me. I bought in March around 19 because I'm a car guy and I saw a top gear video on it, started researching their tech, hot-swappable batteries, growth etc. And it was a crazy ride but the way I looked at it was I bought this stock specifically because I believed in it and what the business was doing and unless something significantly changes about that I will stay in it. SO I just don't look at it often. maybe once a week etc but I just try to avoid constantly checking what the value is
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-03 12:53:11'] you never ever have anything to worry about if you don't invest more than you can afford to lose which I suspect 90% of investors/gamblers never do..greed gets the best of everyone. my portfolio is just like everyone elses and i'm not panicking whatsoever..it can drop 50% and i'll still be ok.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 00:46:39'] There's a concept called greater fool. It means you buy a stock only based on thinking that someone will be foolish enough to buy higher later. It's not a good strategy. If i don't believe the stock has solid fundamentals i won't buy it. Tesla is an example of the greater fool, where people don't truly think it's worth that much. And that's why it's now crashing. TESLA could be the next Apple long term but it'll take years and a pivot in their strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 01:08:26'] It doesn't matter if you buy a stock for $100 and the next day it falls to $30.  You hold it for long term if you believe in the company.  You don't need the money now, but 20 years from now!

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 08:04:22'] Tesla has a cumulative deficit in retained earnings so even holding a treasury bond would be more profitable than 14 years of selling cars. But I feel like this is a disingenuous comparison.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 00:42:39'] I trimmed my Tesla position after their btc investment. To me they are now too tied together. Telsa stock may take a dump every time btc goes down a lot, and I'm not comfortable with that.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 14:22:51'] Is it not some degree of market manipulation when a publicly traded company makes a SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT in a CRYPTO CURRENCY and then the CEO of said company tweets about it? I should not have to wait on every one of Musk's tweets to find materially important changes to TSLA's balance sheet. These kinds of announcements should be filed correctly and reported on correctly, so at least things are following some normal procedure.   The crypto investment is honestly totally a new thing we have never experienced before. Usually a tweet from a CEO about a recent company acquisition could not have a material impact on that same investment they just bought... Something doesn't seem right.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 14:57:03'] Easy when the CEO can pump it himself without consequences.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 08:08:45'] I sold all my tsla stock in my regular portfolio when there was a small downturn during the pandemic (my 401K is all tsla thankfully). Anyways, I was really angry at myself even though I sold for a 700% profit, because I know about and invested in tesla before anyone knew who was elon musk or tesla, back when people thought an EV was a fantasy that would never get to the masses. Now, not so much because I invested a large chunk of that money in BTC at the time and boom. Now I think tesla is a little overvalued and BTC is heavily undervalued. Just my thoughts after being lucky with my terrible decisions

They're opening 2 new gigafactories while beating analyst expectations every quarter. People are still valuing Tesla as just a car company rather than a technology company, and that's why the bears will continue being proven wrong no matter how much Tesla hate they spread.If you look at their advances in energy, robotics, and AI, plus the speed that they're ramping, it's clear they have enormous growth coming this decade.

Its simple, 200 EMA acts as a primary support and resistance, 50 next and 10 the last. What I am seeing is TSLA is expected to have a run-up till 900 or so, and then decline till its able to break out of the 200 EMA. I am expecting the 200 EMA to decline to create a tight trading range till there is news to break it. Thoughts?

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-29 21:23:10'] TSLA like all other tech stocks do trade in tandem with overall market. Macroeconomics if you please have to face couple of important issues; inflation, rates hikes and Fed unwinding their 7 tril asset balance sheet.  Don‚Äôt know who is going to absorb that. If done too quickly it will crash the market. If done too slowly, they face the possibility of unable to finance the debt. Can the US gov‚Äôt service the 2x GDP/yr debt with rising rates?  These macro factors with untimely Fed ‚Äúunwinding‚Äù will blow any good news individual companies may have. We are facing possibly a decade long of stagnation at best, depression at worst.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 20:52:09'] A lot of these stocks never any sense to me from an investor's perspective, and I'm saying this as someone who knows the EV industry well.* Lordstown - I have no idea why this stock ever appealed to anyone. I never even heard anyone hyped up for any of their vehicles. I doubt anyone but the most hardcore EV enthusiasts could even name one of their EV models that they've announced.* Lucid - At least it had promise with it's vehicle. But the problem is it simply entered the market too late and only sells very high end luxury vehicles. Also the Saudi backers are undermining the stock by forcing them to build a factory in Saudi Arabia, a country that's a good distance away from all 3 of the largest car markets (China, the US, & Europe) and where there's very little demand for EV's.* Nikola - The thing was clearly a scam from a mile away. And Hydrogen powered vehicles are NOT EV's, it doesn't matter to the consumer if the hydrogen is turned into electricity to run the car when there's no hydrogen refueling stations near them. IMO it's flat out false advertising to claim that Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are EVs given that it can confuse consumers.* Nio - Their battery swap stations make no sense. Tesla explored this many years ago in their early days but ditched it for good reason, it's way more expensive to scale then building out an EV charging infrastructure. And Battery-As-A-Service is a terrible idea to, which is why no one else has adopted the strategy. If it weren't for them pursuing these bad strategies then Nio would be a lot more viable IMO.* Rivian - This company simply moves WAY too slow to be successful. It took them 12 years to bring a single vehicle to market. Bottom line, if you want to invest in EV's just buy Tesla stock, it'll be a lot safer then any of these other EV stocks the OP mentions (given that they're sitting on a ton of cash and are making a profit, unlike the rest of these money losing EV stocks, most of which will probably go bankrupt sooner or later).

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 17:25:00'] Pretty much every company that becomes a mega cap or blue chip tends to start out as an IPO with decent publicity and the underwriters being established big banks. The companies that ‚Äúmake it big‚Äù have access to the best possible channels for funding. Their ‚Äúsmall cap phase‚Äù was private and had solid VC backing. You pretty much never see a public micro cap or small cap make that transition and grow into a mega cap, because there‚Äôs probably a good reason they didn‚Äôt get that type of backing from established players.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-26 05:08:52'] As a TSLA owner and investor I can tell you there's more to their fan base than being first to market. What you're seeing is other legacy automakers coming to maker with EVs that lack one if not all of the following TSLA moats: range, autopilot, charging network, horsepower. For e.g. Nissan has a new EV mid size suv coming out for $50k USD. It has a max range of like 285 miles (vs 315 for Tesla Model Y) and acceleration of 7.1s which is almost twice as slow. Then you have to charge the thing and nobody has as many chargers globally than Tesla. Competitors will come but they'll still have to play catch up in my opinion. Even if BMW, who I love, came out with a new EV tomorrow for the same price as my Model 3 (they won't), I would be hard pressed to make a change just because of the above important differentiators.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 10:19:30'] Guidance is very important. With Tesla guiding that their cybertruck is delayed and that they don't built a cheaper car, there might be less certainty that they will become the biggest car company in the world (as their stock would suggest). Nvidia is priced 3x higher than their usual valuation, so it might just go back to the mean. Lucid doesn't sell a lot of cars and is priced as it is one of the biggest players in the market. AMD... no idea, normal market volatility I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 09:58:57'] Beating earnings mean nothing. What happened last quarter is priced in already unless there is a surprise.Guidance is what is important, a lot of companies talk about supply chain issues in the last quarter and through the entire of 2022 as well (Intel, AMD and Nvidia said it will persist through 2022 few months ago already).Tesla was not different, supply chain issues reduced their production in the last quarter and the issues will persist through 2022, when you are priced for perfection and then issues happen, people dump.

Margin pressure is the biggest threat to the Tesla bull narrative. Tesla has big efficiencies and made timely investments that other competitors don‚Äôt have/didn‚Äôt make, so higher margins now aren‚Äôt pure vapor - there‚Äôs a reason for it. But I continue to think those have to trend toward industry norms in the long term, and the present valuation is too rich if that happens.

German and Japanese car makers have large enough moat to make competitive products. Europeans will always prefer euro cars, and will prefer a BMW made EV to Tesla, same as Asian will prefer a Toyota. Once the  factories of European car makers get setup for large volumes of EVs, there is no stopping. They will ultimately win the numbers game (cars sold), margins will probably be lower than Tesla though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-15 03:42:44'] In my opinion auto dealers in general are overvalued everyone is basing their valuation from the pandemic days where people were forced to buy over MSRP and dealers weren‚Äôt incentivized to give out deals. Analysts that believe in these companies are hoping that consumers will continually overpay for their cars and that manufacturer incentives won‚Äôt come back so that dealers can maintain margins. When you have people underwater on their overpriced car it‚Äôs going to be hard to flip them into a new deal, some are taking themselves out the market due to the poor pricing and rising interest rates will decrease demand. Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs. Autonation for example had a random rally in their Q4 earnings despite net income dropping, a conveniently placed share buyback and the company themselves claiming that used cars will be more expensive for them to obtain. They‚Äôre now down -16% from that earning report. There‚Äôs still hard to obtain cars such as hybrids, EVs and enthusiast products but regular petrol models are widely becoming available without having to fight for MSRP.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 11:48:30'] It's not the 'next big thing' in the sense that it is already happening. However the no. EV's you see on the road will massively increase in the next 5 years, it's already happening with EV growth in every single industrialized country sometimes doubling every year like it is in China. So it's certainly a good thing to invest in.I have money in Tesla because they have strong financials and good growth outlook. People have been concerned about them cutting prices but theyre going to be selling more cars as the EV market gets bigger which should even things out + it really hurts the smaller EV companies as they have to compete with lower prices while having much worse financials. The main drawback to Tesla is the high stock price imoAll the major automakers are transitioning to EVs/will be very soon so you can look at those too. Good luck
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 12:38:41'] Now many automotive industries are starting to produce new energy, but the top of the electric car is still Tesla
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 14:10:42'] You can't. This business is totally random. Only 2 automakers in US history have not gone bankrupt. Tesla and Ford.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 14:47:40'] Personally I think its the older manufacturers who have transitioned to EVs that are cheap right now, while the new EV only manufacturers are massively overvalued
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 04:48:21'] I have no idea what EV my fellow citizens are going to buy but I absolutely know they will be plugging them in to an outlet for decades to come. I am slowly accumulating utility companies who will be required to provide all of the energy for the EVs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 06:53:30'] Who‚Äôs in the running to be the biggest or best provider of charging stations is one interesting question in my mind. Who will be the biggest or best innovator in battery technology would be the other question I would be keeping tabs on. In my mind looking for the company positioned best in terms of charging stations means you don‚Äôt go too risky on which manufacturer will compete with Tesla in the very challenging vehicle market. Anyone have thoughts or answers or already researched those questions?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 05:05:53'] I would study the batteries, how they work what they are made of where that comes from, and what could happen to change the game.

POST_TEXT: b'I am thinking of liquidating my shares in the next couple of months to put towards the downpayment of a house. I am trying to find out if there are any positive catalysts for the next 2-3 months I should wait for that can increase the stock price?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 09:57:29'] Earnings on 2 Feb Im waiting for that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 09:58:42'] Q4 earnings at the end of this month are going to be phenomenal. Analysts are going to be increasing their price targets more in the lead up to it and afterwards. So in my opinion Tesla will be higher 1 month from now. However, it's a risky business holding a stock that you need the money for in a few months. Tesla is a volatile stock, so any unexpected negative event can cause it to drop drastically. You don't want that to be the cause of you losing your house when you have it in the bag right now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 15:58:32'] Earnings, though they may be priced in already since most of the surprise factor is in the just released delivery numbers. Negative catalyst might be inflation or rate increases.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 09:45:05'] I really doubt it although I sold all my TSLA about a year ago (700% is enough for me) so maybe I'm not the best judge.  Fed rate hikes and tapering will hit growth stocks hard.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-05 13:26:42'] Short-term catalysts include: Q4 earnings results, Giga Berlin & Giga Texas starting production, updated product roadmap just to name a few. There's always something to look forward to with Tesla stock.However, if you need to put a downpayment on a house, I would sell within a few days after Q4 earnings (which will be later this month). That should be the opportune moment in the short-term.The biggest threat to Tesla in the short-term is the overall macro environment which has been super bearish on growth stocks recently.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 18:24:00'] It doesn't matter what people online tell you to invest in, or when to buy, sell, or hold. It also doesn't matter what they think.The important thing when making an investment is that you have an understanding of the story of the company, its catalysts, its trajectory, and its balance sheet. Only then will you be able to stomach 50% drops in the red and still hold because you understand the true value and potential. You need to understand how the stock price is affected by all of those things, otherwise you will never know when to buy, sell, or hold. If you have a thesis, you will know when to buy or sell. If you don't, you will be filled with anxiety and doubt. It's just gambling.If you don't feel confident in your decisions as an investor, stick to ETFs until you have a deep understanding of a company.Sincerely, Tesla investor since 2015.

But your call, it's a gamble play, so don't keep if you can't afford to lose it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 23:47:14'] Its going to the moon, no its going to Mars eventually. Every car Tesla makes is profitable. EV is the future. Solar is just going to get more juicy as gas/electricity rates go up. Buy more, Gamble, Win big. If it goes down just keep buying more (dollar cost average) until you are ready to retire or at least close enough to avoid risk. Diversification is fine for older folks and people who are scared of gambling but look at the people who stayed in AAPL the last 10 years. Tesla will be a roller coaster but I feel its products are so so profitable compared to any other automaker with fewer long term liabilities. If you want to get rich, find a winner and stick with it, even double down on it. I know this is not popular advice here and its gambly but too many pull money out of winning stocks and invest it in safe but mediocre alternatives. If you can afford it, TESLA is a fine stock to bet the house on. It went crazy high, came back down and will probably to crazy high again at some point. Just enjoy the ride. So Im telling you to gamble. But look at the future. The cybertruck and freight business will bring huge profits, automated cars and taxis will bring huge profits, ongoing subscriptions will bring huge profits. Tesla is not just building nice cars, its a massive robot factory too. Musk is a genius and if you can afford to gamble, he is about the best bet out there right now (in my biased but humble opinion). Disclosure:  I'm long on TSLA and will be for at least the next 10 years.Some other things to consider: if you sell and this is in a taxable account, make sure you allow for a big tax bill - preferably offset the gains against other losses if you have them.

Of course, but the fact is the forward p/e ratio indicates that the company is horribly overvalued and I feel like the downside risk is not worth the potential upside.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 01:17:50'] Take the gains
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 01:21:56'] I would sell. Cause there‚Äôs going to be another drop. And when it drops a you can re invest
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 01:45:25'] Tesla is definitely bouncing back to its former glory so no keep it longer I'd say
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 01:48:19'] I sold my 120 dollar buy after earnings just because I don't think anything has fundamentally changed for the business and this was just a bear rallyI'll look to buy more back again if we hit the lows
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 01:50:08'] Sell your original stake at least and keep 20-30% in to ride. That way you‚Äôve lost nothing if it drops and you can still ride up more.Honestly, sell today. Don‚Äôt let FOMC screw your profits, just in case
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:02:55'] If you don't want to sell now, when would you do it? :)  My strategy is - do you think that the stock will go up? If yes, keep money there. If not, withdraw. Any history is irrelevant.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:08:04'] Sounds like you're just gambling, not investing, so I would just sell and take the win.If you're actually investing, I'm sure you had an idea of what Tesla should be worth in X amount of years. Calculate the annual ROI if that does end up happening, and decide whether that reward is worth the risk of being wrong compared to simply owning the S&P. If yes, then just hold.Do the work, don't rely on random people's advice on the internet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:17:54'] You should already know based on your strategy and your analysis on the stock. Since you are relying on strangers on reddit i suggest you sell and take the profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:22:57'] I‚Äôd sell half
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 02:22:59'] I think if you're scared of losing money you should just sell because it will hurt if it happens but then you will probably moan after you sell and the stock goes up. My advice would be just do what hurts less, you can never get out at  the perfect time so don't dwell on it after your decision. I see someone suggested selling half and that seems like good advice.Personally I'm holding my Telsa stock for the time being.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 03:48:15'] If you don't know, then trim.  Sell half (or maybe 60%, to take your initial purchase out), and let the free money fly.  That way, if it comes back down, you can reinvest your initial and enjoy more free money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:04:27'] I wouldn‚Äôt call it an investment if you‚Äôve only held it for 2 weeks. Just sell it if you aren‚Äôt able to take the risk of losing on a trade.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 04:59:17'] If you hold the stock for less than a year, you will pay higher taxes on the profit. You just want to make sure you factor that in when you figure out your profit. It‚Äôs not going to be 30%, due to the costs (taxes, transaction fees).
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:15:29'] I've always been told to recapture your initial investment and ride the rest out. Personally I bought in pre splits and continue to buy more. I believe with the charging stations contracts alone Tesla will continue to grow and split so do what you're comfortable with. I'm not giving financial advice just recommending you are comfortable with all possible outcomes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:39:12'] You clearly don't have any conviction in Tesla as a company. You should sell. I think Tesla will outperform by a significant margin and a lot of people covering Tesla still believe this is a great time to buy. I think you will be disappointed when Tesla comes out of the next few years as a significantly larger company but you should do your own research.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 05:45:06'] I personally would sell... But that‚Äôs based on my own strategy.. One of the reasons for the spikes was a good round on their recent earnings call which gives it a good boost...

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:02:19'] If you are a swing trader, following several indicators, really showed "over bought" on the 30th of January. That's when I sold. But that was also decided because the price went up so fast, I felt there may be some pressure of a short term correction. Incidentally, I got into Tesla December 16th because those same indicators all showed over sold. There's about an 80% accuracy of reversal or continuation of trend. I'm my case, yes, it did continue down, I was down about 20% which was killing me, but my son kept encouraging me and I did have ultimate faith in my charts. I sold yesterday morning. I was watching pre market for a big dump and it didn't so I held until open and after considering I felt good about the 17% overall gain, (and I'm a swing trader) and the price was dropping. There's no emotion, I hit sell. You are only down 6% from there but it's your call and it should be based on your investment style. I have no doubt TSLA will be higher. But the ups and downs take time, that run was a quick gift that I wouldn't expect to continue.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:02:46'] If you see the trend, after those rallies, tesla usually goes into an up and down stage where people who made a huge profit sell and people with fomo.keep.buying so the price doesnt move for some time, then it either goes down or it goes up again.Honestly with such a volatile stock, I would just take my 30% gains and leave
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:08:17'] I think they're close to accurately valued now, they were definitely overvalued before but I think a lot of people were exaggerating by how much. Tesla is more than just an auto manufacturer and potential is part of the valuation. But a Musk tweet always has the potential to change this, the Twitter drama has calmed a lot so now may be a good time before it sparks back up again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 07:20:04'] I like selling enough to cover you initial investment. Let the rest roll. No matter if it goes up or down it‚Äôs all profit

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:15:59'] Sell
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 08:18:49'] What you need to consider is that although Tesla has had high growth in the past, its P/E is almost 7-8 times more than its competitors, and it is no longer the sole EV maker on the market.I would sell, but I also understand that Tesla has not been the most rational of companies, and it may just go to $250 to thumb it in analysts‚Äô faces. All that to say, you need to decide.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:35:32'] I would sell, because i learned from my past mistakes. It happend 2 times. The first was a stock, you know the gaming store. Put in thousands of euros, next week was the highest it has ever been. I could sell, the profit was right there, it was a lot. And i mean a LOT. But i was greedy. Stock went down, i saw red for weeks. Took a year to get some profit again and sold right away. It was not much, but that's my own fault for beeing greedy. Lesson learned, i thought, because it happend again. But this time it wasn't a stock. It was a coin, the one with the dog on it. Again, put in thousands. It went up for several weeks, then Mr Musk went on a late night show, i was ready for it, this is the moment it will shoot up 1000%. Up to this point, i could cash out and be happy, but i was greedy. Coin went down HARD. And after a few days of seeing it go down, i just sold. Scared of the red number that will come. Took a small profit instead of a very big one. That was really when it happend. I learned from it. After that, i did not get greedy anymore. Had 2 big gains since then.Tldr: Better safe than sorry. You either have profit or the unknown.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 16:33:31'] I'm not sure if anyone has given you this piece of advice before, but here it is.The stock market I what you make it. When everyone first starts they usually say "wow, I can make money just off my phone",  the Beginner's luck can take you up up amd away. But then comes the fall. Knowing or un-knowingly people make the stock market their gambling machine. My advise to you is to make the stock market your learning machine first and then learn to use your knowledge to make money. Without overwhelming you here are a few things you can focus on:1.) Learn why a stock is good for you to trade. Don't just get in because you overheard someone's opinion.2.) Learn some risk management. Risk management is King, and never forget that. Risk management is one of the fundamental building blocks to trading/investing/entrepreneurship that is kept regardless of how much experience you gain.3.) Don't be so worried about strategies. Find one strategy focus on it and then with experience, you'll learn what you like, dislike, and can improve on.Good luck on your journey.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 04:50:01'] Do a little math, if your up 30%, sell half and then calculate a reasonable stop loss on the remaining half so you're guaranteed to not lose money.This way you take some money off the table, still have some shares if the stock continues to run, and some cash on the side (from the profits) to buy back in cheaper if the stock drops and you decide to do so.

If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, Ill try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Teslas business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for TSLAs stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I do not own shares in TSLA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\n\nFirst lets review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **85%** of their sales comes from **Automotive Sales**. Another **3%** comes from **Automotive Leasing**. **Energy generation and storage** makes up for **5%** and the remaining **6%** are **Services and** **Other.**\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required retur'

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-05 00:34:30'] TSLA is an overvalued cult stock. One day, it might, and probably will warrant its current massive overvaluation. For now, I feel my money is safer invested elsewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-05 06:05:16'] Stock valuation is decided by supply and demand of the shares before anything else. Yes company valuation comes in play when a stock has gone past the excessive demand phase. Investors then use company valuation to decide buy or sell which then rebalance the whole supply and demand. TSLA shares are in excessive demand now and it will be for many years to come. EV market is just beginning to expand and in the next ten years it will take about 30-40 percent of the auto market. You can guess how much TSLA will be capturing of that market. Existing automakers are not a threat because they have a whole infrastructure built around regular cars and it will take them many years just build infrastructure to produce as many ev cars. All of you that are doing company fundamentals right now are just going to be missing out on the gain you can have by going long with TSLA. Don‚Äôt forget if autonomous driving start being implemented in the next 10 years you will wish you invested in TSLA today price. There is no company like TSLA out there
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-05 00:47:41'] No.

You‚Äôre not gonna see another 50-60% drop with this company anymore.  Their balance sheet is solid and they‚Äôre selling out their cars quarter after quarter.  You literally have to wait months for a new car.  Demand is not an issue at all.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-05 01:38:51'] I don't own TSLA stocks, nor do I plan to own them, but it isn't really a valuation.You base your valuation of a company on analyst valuation, that are not today's valuation either. You don't know what analysts took into account when giving their valuation of the company, maybe some thought Tesla can produce flying cars in a year from their valuation or maybe they considered the US forcing TSLA to stop producing cars due to crashing into emergency vehicle.Analysts valuations are nice but they shouldn't be the only thing a valuation is based on.

POST_TEXT: b'Im still a noob learning the ins and outs of options trading. \n\nI saw someone posting on WSB they bought 14k worth of calls on TSLA with strike price of $206 expiring september. He bought this when Tesla crashed a few weeks ago, down to $160. \n\nThis week Tesla jumped to $170, and that alone netted him $7k profit.\n\nThis seems like free money or easy money. Of course Tesla is bound to have a few pumps. It doesnt have to reach $200 by September, all it had to do was move in the upward direction and it made him $7k. How is this risky?? You dont have to wait till september and you dont have to wait till it reaches $200.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:14:35'] Fuck around & find out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:23:47'] because if it doesn't go the way you want you lose everything by expiration
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:30:50'] You‚Äôre using to hindsight knowing that $160 was the bottom and assuming it was easy money. What if he spent that $14k and it kept dropping, he would‚Äôve lost everything. Options are very risky, but can pay big. Options you have to guess the direction AND time it correctly. What if Tesla went up to $190 in September and then pumped up to $250 in October? He would‚Äôve lost everything even though he was correct in the direction, but was wrong on timing
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:26:46'] All trading is risky. Options are higher risk higher reward.Why? They have a deadline. And the closer they get to it the exponentially worse their value becomes in comparison when trading the value of the contract itself. And if the trade doesn't go in your favour by the deadline you lose 100% of your investment. But there are ways to use them that are lower risk too. For example, if I'm entering a trade with shares and decide I'm happy to risk 10% of my investment and put a stop loss there I could have instead took whatever money that 10% loss would have represented and purchased calls with it instead. Or if I buy 100 shares I can lower the risk of the trade by also buying a Put to cap my max loss instead. In these scenarios options buy you time instead of time working against you because a stop loss just triggers. Whereas with options you get until expiry for the trade to recover.That's barely scratching the surface of greeks and options strategies. And in that lies the main risk. People trading options that don't understand what they are doing, get lucky, get addicted, keep going and then eventually hit a big loss and it's all gone.Like sure that Tesla trade you provide as an example was a great trade with a decent amount of time given to it and they took profits. But if you're in certain communities you'll see people do trades like that then YOLO the entire thing into a 0 DTE SPY option for a FOMC meeting, get it wrong and goodbye money. I've seen loss porn 6 figures big regularly.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:36:04'] Have you ever lit your money on fire before?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:22:31'] now imagine when tesla hit 200 few weeks back and you bought a call? sometimes you get lucky when you bought at the bottom, most of the time, not so much
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 12:19:43'] Because they can expire worthless. Your replies show you have no idea what theta is or how it works.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:47:17'] Firstly, because options have an expiration. So it‚Äôs entirely possible you‚Äôll lose the money. And I don‚Äôt mean sell at a loss, I mean poof, it‚Äôs gone. Secondly, on WSB, they tend to use Robinhood. And Robinhood isn‚Äôt great, and I‚Äôve seen several posts of people not understanding how much risk they were taking on. One person was getting margin called for $350,000. Lastly, go back to WSB and see how many people blew up their accounts trading options.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 10:30:00'] Because you're using synthetic leverage, magnifying the risk you're taking on by several orders of magnitude
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:46:54'] To make a profitable buy option trade  you need all of these in your favor:1- Timing of move - in the right direction2- Speed of move - in the right direction3- Exit at the correct time - if both the above things go right for you.To make a profit you need everything to go right. If not, you loose the amount you used to buy the option.Over a large enough sample size, probability of being right on the first 2 factors right next to impossible, being correct on 3 .........
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 15:50:04'] It is definitely not risky (as much most think) as far as the umbrella term "options trading."If anything it can be less risky than buying stock, but yes, it can also be quite the opposite.What the WSB user did was lottery YOLO, versus trading. There's some gambling aspects in trading but it can\* be more focused on educated, probabilistic trading. Plan and management driven, so to speak.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:38:34'] Best way to learn is experience. Go trade options for the rest of the year and then report back.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:22:05'] Short term price direction isn't usually easy to predict.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:57:39'] its an asset type with a defined, fixed "expiration" date, where you WILL lose everything, if you hold that long. Bonds, stocks, CDs, other assets don't have expiration dates.Because options are also based on something underlying, they move in multiplicative and exponential ways, which makes them extremely volatile. Again, not so with other asset classes.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:37:52'] Ok I‚Äôm an options trader and will clarify some misconceptions here. Like all asset classes there are riskier strategies and not. Just like stock trading there are riskier stocks and not so risky stocks. I would actually consider a buy and hold strategy of SPY (or any other stock) to be a riskier strategy than the way I trade options. The guy bought a call on TSLA out of the money expiring in Sept. The risks are that the stock drops. It may never recover and because of time decay even if it goes back up he may still lose money (or all or most of his investment) if there isn‚Äôt enough time left to hit the strike price. An option is priced according to five ‚ÄúGreeks‚Äù. Delta, theta, gamma, Vega and rho. You should have a good grasp of the Greeks before touching options. Most people who invest in stocks look for one way to profit. The stock needs to go up. (Or you can short but I gather most people don‚Äôt short stocks as it‚Äôs more complicated.) As a net short options trader I can profit in any market environment, bearish, slightly bearish, neutral, bullish or extremely bullish. I have strategies I can employ for whatever market environment. I also can limit my max loss on any one trade and believe it or not reduce volatility and risk as compared to a simple buy and hold strategy. I control probability of success and amount of profit and loss. There are trade offs for each of course but you just need to know what you‚Äôre doing and appropriately size your positions and trades. So the bottom line is it isn‚Äôt that ‚Äúoptions trading is risky‚Äù. It‚Äôs how it‚Äôs employed. For example investors in SVB who have all of their money in one stock would‚Äôve lost all of their investment employing a buy and hold strategy. Similarly the investor who shorted puts would‚Äôve had their whole account wiped out and then some  if they over leveraged. The issue isn‚Äôt so much with options trading as it is with position sizing. That is what gets people into trouble. The OP thinks that this is free or easy money. Nothing is free or easy. Everything has trade offs. As a successful options trader I don‚Äôt worry about how much I can make. I worry about how much I can lose. And I size my position and max loss potential to reflect that. In my years of trading stocks and options I can tell you that being a net short options trader gives you a far higher risk adjusted return than a simply indexing strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 11:45:05'] I thought options trading was safer since you have more options
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 14:13:05'] Only if you buy options. If you sell options and you want to own the stock or ETF anyways then selling imho is way safer.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 16:19:27'] You can be right, and also be wrong at the same time. Losing money when you‚Äôre right is why it totally messes with your head.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 16:27:20'] Greeks
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 16:44:36'] Because if you're wrong or don't do proper risk management, losses are big.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 19:51:26'] I believe most options expire worthless. As I recall the number might be about 75% because of how the math works out. There's also some things with options you have to worry about that you don't have to with normal stocks. Time decay is one of them. As time goes on, your options get more and more worthless if they don't move the right way in price. >This week Tesla jumped to $170, and that alone netted him $7k profit.Risk $14,000 expiring as $0, and you made $7,000 (assuming he sold as soon as the 7k in profit hit, if not it will likely go to 0). Does that sound like a fair deal to you? You can do the exact same thing by just buying the stock. The only thing options give you is more leverage, but they take the benefits away by charging you in things like time decay, implied volatility, and market expectations. With all that said, there are some far less risky ways to play options, but just buying them is not 1 of them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 20:13:57'] Give it a whirl and come back in 3 months and tell us how much money you've lost. lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-07 07:26:33'] Buying options like you have suggested is extremely risky, it‚Äôs basically gambling. Nothing wrong with it if you know that‚Äôs what it is. What it‚Äôs not is investing. Now, selling options is very safe and is not gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 12:14:31'] It has lots of dimentions, the easyness to trigger the button to play thowsands of contracs with little money, lets say you start with 10000 usd, and play to think that with expiration day this can be 1 Million, yes it CAN be but with low very low probability, the problem Arises when you start to win in the beggining, you will be undestructable you might think, then you will start to bet more and more untill you get nothing, the best way to mitigate this is by buying a good book about option trading and hedging and use money management.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 15:30:03'] If you buy stocks you have to be right about direction (up/down). If you buy options you have to be right about direction, the timeframe (expiration) and the size of the move. If you guess wrong, you lose. You can lose half of your portfolio within weeks with options. Be careful. There is no free lunch.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 07:38:49'] Take a look at the stock return vs. the S&P 500 index since it entered the S&P 500 in December 2020.  It is at or below the return of the S&P 500 over most of that period.  It is now a significantly worse investment than that index over that time period.  Had you sold out of Tesla around the time it entered the S&P 500 and bought Ford, you would have nearly doubled your money. Point is, the stock is now held and traded by large institutions and it's going to generally track its index over time. IMO the days of huge jumps for beating expectations are over.  This is now a  large cap stock that wont break away from its index performance overall.As to your question since the stock is well below the return of the index, I would think it will eventually move back towards that rate of return so price should go back up.  But totally speculation on my part.
	COMMENT: ['2022-01-28 07:00:37'] With record earnings and a solid outlook, it will, but it could take a couple of months at the minimum. With the broader markets crashing, whatever you're investing in, Tesla or others, look at it from at least a 6-months perspective

However, if they expand, then i think 1k - even after the split is good and not really overvalued.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-11 17:28:07'] One red day and whole reddit is trying to pump this up. Retards are going crazy and think a 800B company will keep rising at same speed for no fking reason. These retards will be the reason many people will lose all their many on Tesla weekly calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-11 14:36:23'] I don't get your 4th point. You say nothing has changed about the company, which nothing has and that it was trading for 100-300 pre-split for years. What does that have to do with anything? Are you saying that nothing has changed so we should be paying 800-900/share (or $4000-4500/share pre-split)?I'll honestly say that I don't get Tesla, and in my eyes its overvalued as hell. But if you want to put your money into that stock good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-12 00:47:01'] I'd argue 4) a slightly different way. Nothing's changed about the company to justify the insane build up.    This is the main reason I quit 80% of my TSLA positions. It's just way too overvalued and bound for a significant correction.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 09:39:52'] this is my train of thought on whether to hold or sell. is there another stock that you are currently eyeing that can make up for the losses if you sell. if not hold until there is or until the stock recovers. that way you are always in the right frame of mind..... also stop loss is a thing should look into it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 18:26:21'] Clearly you shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to make financial decisions...Venmo your money to me and I‚Äôll take care of the investing. Serious though - who cares? The price today doesn‚Äôt matter. If you believe in the company, then you should‚Äôve bought based on what you think it‚Äôll be worth in 5+ years. Barring a change in your belief in the company, the price between now & then is just noise. Hold. Don‚Äôt be emotional.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 19:21:29'] Imagine buying a stock because of FOMO and wanting to sell it a week later because the price went down lol

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 20:07:40'] Just hold it and let it go to 5k in 3 years.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 20:15:09'] You might be holding for years. Or days. It‚Äôs a bubble so there‚Äôs no way to know. If you think you can make up the losses with liquid cash in the next few months, I‚Äôd sell. Otherwise, just hold. Tesla will be worth 3k, eventually. It just may be after Biden‚Äôs a few years in.

One or two weeks pass and you are whining about buying a stock that has literally 50 posts a day here about how overvalued it is?If you are going to buy TSLA at that price, have enough respect for yourself to have some kind of thesis of what *you* actually think is going to happen except *durrrrrr... up.*If you think TSLA is a 4k stock (which is insane in my book), own it. There is literally NOTHING that happened between the time you bought it at 1770 and today that is a material change.To me, this kind of post is about as dumb as you can get. Put on your big boy pants and *own* your investments or buy index funds. *durrrrr.... up* isn't a great strategy.

Keep your patience and hold it. I bought in around 960 and the highest I paid was around 1,200. I'm holding for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:07:45'] Come back to this thread in 2024, and you will remember how dumb you were for thinking you were dumb.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 08:35:13'] Nothing has changed outside of the stocks price from when you bought. If you sell you will have a loss. If you hold you have more possible outcomes. Larger loss, Same loss, Less of a loss, Gain.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 09:09:07'] What exactly do you buy? Is stocks and not calls just hold then for ever.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 09:12:17'] If you have a very small amount in there I would keep it.If you have a good chunk in there which would work better for you elsewhere then I'd take it out even it meant a small loss.FOMO is a MF'er. Gets all of us. Half of Tesla's share price is hype and future prospects, only takes a bad quarter or Elon smoking weed to cause a small dip that you can buy.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 09:58:58'] its never a great idea to buy in when stock is mercurial. But I wont sell now since you have jumped in. Wait for Q2 results and then battery day. it could hit new ATH soon. But dont know how much it can run in next few years. its already at over 300B market cap at your purchase price. Unless they have robo taxi business minting money in next few years I dont see it have that much potential.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 10:18:45'] Dyu believe in the company? If so hold.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 10:25:05'] If you still believe it's worth so much. Buy the dip.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 10:37:48'] Just curious what made you think to buy it at that price? From my point of view that price is just way too high. Was it FOMO?

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:14:06'] How many shares did you buy? If you are really stressing and worried about a collapse and you only bought a few shares, and you can take a loss - you can probably sell now and just wait for a dip and buy again, or go into something else. In the big picture, a few hundred or even a few thousand $ can be made back later.On the other hand if you bought a ton of shares and would take a major loss if you sold now, you may have no choice but to hold for a while and hope it shoots back up (which it may easily do). Just my 2 cents.  Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 16:13:18'] Its a solid company but I bet it's going to drop more. You could sell and cut your loss because it's anyone's guess which way it will go now and I suspect it's overbought significantly. That said, it could also go up. Its hard to say because Tesla is a cult stock with massive hype. If it didn't have cult status and hype most people would tell you it's going to drop, a lot. The problem with hype is that you don't know when it will end. Probably why even though people load up on Tesla shorts they keep getting burned. But it will stop eventually. The graph can't bend over back on itself. It has to correct eventually.The problem I see with Tesla at this value is that it's not something everyone has or is looking to get. Apple and Amazon, I get it. Everyone uses prime. Everyone wants an iPhone.Not everyone wants a Tesla and when I drive I still see only a handful of them. A lot of car owners still have problems with the idea of getting a Tesla. Especially truck owners which is a huge part of the market. If they had it, maybe they would deserve this valuation. I think people are pricing in future market dominance before it's happened. It's become very speculative.Your only other option. (other than sell or hold) is to start averaging your price down. I would do it slowwwwwly. That means increasing your exposure to risk though and you're potentially in for a long time. You put in smaller amounts of money at lower prices and start averaging cost out to increase your position. I would only do this if you're leaning towards going long and you have money to burn. Do it in several price levels. Start with a small piece and increase as the dip expands. You will know when it's going back to steady and back up.Be wary of prices that are parabolic. Be sure it's going to continue or stay away from it. People like to say on reddit "stonks go up" and they do, but they also go down. The majority of stocks are not a straight arrow up and it's entirely possible that some levels will not be seen again. That's true for the majority of stocks. When they are exploring new prices, it's risky to buy in.One thing you can do, is you can watch the volume indicator and check sentiments around the stock in the next few days. If they start trickling off, that's a bad sign.Learn the lesson from this.&#x200B;I feel for you and anyone I see who makes this kind of post. I've been exactly where you are and it cost me 5 figures. I waited a long time when I bought near the top and eventually sold out. 3 years later and it still hasn't retraced. It just keeps hitting lower highs. Maybe next year.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 17:18:04'] Buy more now and lower your cost basis. If you bought hoping it would go up in a week and you'd make a quick profit then it was a dumb move. If you bought because you think it will go up over 2-3 or 5 years, then you shouldn't be concerned about a drop after a few days. It will bounce back. Be patient.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 18:11:24'] Depending on how much stock you bought, you can buy some puts to hedge your investment.   If the stock goes down, you make $$, then can reinvest those to lower your basis.   Otherwise, just hold.   It‚Äôll reach $2000 by 2025.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 16:37:42'] Sell it before you take a bath, $1770 is nothing to sneeze at. I thought I was silly for buying a single share at $220.85. It's was  my only "I can say own stock in this cool company but I'm not risking much" share. I sold it a few days ago. A T-shirt is a less risky and longer term souvenir.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 10:36:31'] You gotta ask yourself why you bought it in the first place. Did you see the growth potential from reading the annual reports and gaining as much info about the company before calculating an appropriate price to buy shares? Or were you greedy and only saw the price go up and up? You already know the answer.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 11:47:16'] FOMO and Sqeezin‚Äô shorts are a hell of a drug.I say that as a current holder of TSLA shares and a believer in the company. But I think this is some kind of perfect storm and it‚Äôs unsettling.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 11:44:56'] I already hold shares, but damn Tesla hold the horses, I wanted to buy more from next salary.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 12:05:40'] Bro, I sold at around $230 as I was under the impression it would stay low for at least a year after it dropped a few months ago. Imagine how much I hate myself.Edit: I should add that I did this partly so I could jump on the Disney hype train. Still waiting to see how that plays out. Stay tuned.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:09:45'] I don't understand people who think Tesla is an automaker. They make whatever product fits the narrative of advancing the world to a sustainable energy future. The big difference between them and any of their competitors is that they actually create compelling products that people love while pushing the boundaries of innovation at breakneck speed.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:22:18'] I think it‚Äôs overpriced, but I also think its shareholders have a cult-like obsession with the company (no offense to you all but there is no DCF in the world that would put their valuation where it is right now, maybe in like 3-5 years) so I would never short it. That being said, I think the potential for the company is ridiculous. If they can iron out all their production issues, build a better infrastructure to support the practicality of mass electric car ownership (better repair and parts availability, more charging stations, faster charging, etc.), and expand their battery production capabilities into large scale battery banks I think the company could go even higher (but I don‚Äôt think you can price those ‚Äúifs‚Äù in just yet). Also I‚Äôve seen a lot of people mention their over air updates, and that‚Äôs not even their tech. That‚Äôs a subsidiary of Blackberry called QNX who has like an 80% market share in the car network communication space.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 10:35:25'] It‚Äôs almost at a higher market cap than top two american manufacturers combined. Make of that what you will.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 11:58:14'] I bought at $230, sold 1/3 at $420 (for the fun of having a screen shot of my sell order at $420, will be framing it), and will probably sell another 1/3 at my second target of $530. I believe Elon will reach his target of $650B in 5 years (Call me crazy if you want, just don\`t be rude about it if you will).

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 12:06:00'] I would not describe TSLA as a bubble so much as a battleground stock. Bulls and bears alike, I think should keep their position sizes to a minimum because the risk:reward is not there, either way.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 21:35:44'] I should have bought it at $250 but I listened to all of you!
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:40:37'] I think Tesla is the chosen one, people will buy the stock just because of Elon's memes and the company in itself doesn't doing bad, when I saw the square car and people were going crazy about it they seemed like Apple, they shape their reality, when people think of electric car Tesla is their first thought just how people think of smartphones and iPhone is the first thought, they have a strong CEO and strong brand, what can go wrong?

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 19:02:39'] It‚Äôs severely undervalued , this is not a car company , it‚Äôs a tech company so you need to compare it to big tech .
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 14:52:51'] It was ridiculously undervalued. The old car makers are all stupidly behind when it comes to electric cars, which is destined to overtake the internal combustion engine. It HAS to. Think about all the old cellphone makers that were still making push button analog screen phones before the iPhone came out. The smartphone was a pivotal technology of its time, and electric cars is the equivalent for transportation. It's not just about the hardware, it's the software as well, and the charging network too. People can shit on Tesla all they want but I'm riding it to at least $1000.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 10:46:58'] To preface my opinion I‚Äôll first say I‚Äôm sure there are people who very successfully time the end of rises in specific stocks and do well investing that way, I just don‚Äôt know them personally. As a general point, just my opinion, if you invest in a growth company, you don‚Äôt sell unless your thesis on the company changes. If you bought Tesla thinking it was a value play then I guess well done, I just don‚Äôt see it that way. I think the skepticism was probably overblown at points(probably justified mostly) and now the optimism is probably a bit high but I do think the company will continue to grow and increase in popularity. I think the network of super chargers is a big differentiator at least for now. I wouldn‚Äôt lose sleep over a stock going up over time when I don‚Äôt own it though, you‚Äôre all good friend.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 16:30:48'] Look at the news surrounding Tesla that isn‚Äôt about Tesla‚Äôs value or stock price. It‚Äôs all good. People actually *complain* about three deaths in a Tesla in the same month. That, to me, says that everyone believes Tesla is so safe that nobody should die in one, ever.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 16:32:34'] If the markets were rational mathematicians would be our overlords. Fortunately they're not. Don't rationalize it. People wanna get on papi Elon's rocket to the moon so the stonk goes up bigly. If you wanna get in on the ride come join us on the dark side, if not, be lame and go buy Visa or something. (disclaimer: proud Visa call owner)Long story short TSLA be going up and sideways probably until earnings. Buy em now while they still hot. Literally free money.Peace
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 23:15:24'] I bought at like 320 and got out at 290...
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 11:20:47'] Just a tip for you since you bought in at 250 and sold at 350, keep your profits in the stocks you profit a ton from. Usually you profit a ton because other people are investing for life.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:09:37'] People who think Tesla is not a car company is delusional and is the exact reason with what‚Äôs wrong with the market. While they do make a bunch of other stuff, at the end of the day they‚Äôll still make most of their money from cars. Unless they have significant margins over their competitors or pivot to receive most of their revenues from high margin businesses they should not have a 10+x premium to their competitors.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 21:28:31'] That's the sound of shorts getting their fucking faces ripped off. Their eyes, their brains, splattered on the back of their office wall as they stare motionless at the TSLA stock price. David Einhorn and Jim Chanos must be sweating bullets right now. So, in the end, funding was secured and the move to smoke cannabis on the Joe Rogan show was all calculated. Never doubt our champion, Sir Elon Musk. My prediction which is based on absolutely nothing is that the price of TSLA could hit 600, maybe even 1000.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 14:32:58'] I do believe in Tesla. I‚Äôm sure they will do fantastic in the coming decades. I just don‚Äôt think they will do better then the market does
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 14:34:56'] It‚Äôs funny the run up started shortly after the cybertruck broken windows and the Tesla haters having a field day.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 14:36:24'] Bought right after the truck announcement slightly tanked the price. Immediately felt remorse. Yeah, that was all the way back around $335. It's at \~$500 now not even ~~four~~ three months later?

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 15:22:19'] It was going up like this in 17 when I bought in. Then I watched it drive in the ditch for three years until now when I‚Äôm finally making some money. I just need to decide how much I‚Äôll let it deflate before I sell.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 16:09:32'] The question nobody seems to be able to answer is what the world looks like where TESLA is profitable enough to justify anything close to even its current valuation, much less a rising one.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 16:17:12'] Tesla is one of those stocks that I just bought enough to the point where I felt like I had skin in the game, but not enough to off myself if they went to $0/share.I love the company and what it stands for and I don‚Äôt plan on selling any time soon. Even though I‚Äôve more than doubled my money in 6 months, i still believe there are bigger things to come.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 16:35:53'] Tesla is absolutely in a bubble. But something has to pop the bubble, and i have no idea what would trigger it. Probably something happening to oje of there products or a huge negative impact of some kind. The company is absolutely not worth what the stock says it is and that is why a lot of big players are shorting it. It makes zero sense that it's this high. They have no way of ever using the money as fast as they need to.Imo if we have a recession this year it will be because of tesla. If i was a fund manager i would be shorting it, especially after today.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 18:47:07'] Don't feel bad for taking some profit. The issue with Tesla is that (I think) it deserves to go higher given its potential to re-make the auto, electric power and transit industries. It could perform like Amazon and Apple given that its products are outstanding. Still the stock might drop like Bitcoin. But unlike Bitcoin, which is an idea, Teslas are real cars. Hold on to the money and wait and see. With zero commission trades, you can slowly rebuild your position 1 to 10 shares every few days or weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 18:53:26'] I can tell you that the Chinese market is flooded with electric cars. I doubt that $TSLA will make much difference here.  There are many affordable electric cars available. Also consider that the government ended their subsidy for citizens buying these vehicles.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 01:03:45'] Disclaimer: I love tesla the company and sold shares at 408, But now it's way too high in my opinion, Its now ranked as the biggest automaker in US History, but only delivered -400,000 cars last year, I wish Tesla would slowly go up as I think the slightest bit of bad news could start a chain reaction of people getting out. I think the reason the share price is up, is because of the share price alone, not the deliveries but instead everyone trying to get in on the action. As soon as some major investors liquidate, you could see major issues. I hope tesla succeeds long term though, love the product, love Elon
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:17:16'] Definitely overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:26:57'] I literally bought in and sold at the same price point as you. But to answer your question, it is completely ridiculously overvalued. They haven‚Äôt really pulled a true profit and they don‚Äôt even have a P/E ratio meaning that they aren‚Äôt truly profitable . It‚Äôs all speculation

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:29:07'] Tesla has been in a 4 year trading range. It's finally now broken out. The first time Tesla was at $380 the Model 3 was still an idea. And there's a lot less risk now that Tesla has executed so well. Their battery tech is going to enable them to go way beyond cars in the future, though the car market is enough to fuel massive growth the next 5+ years.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:36:06'] It's the most idiotic bubble currently on the market.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 15:13:05'] It was under valued (still is).&#x200B;I called this, very publicly, just one month ago:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncoL9zUI7\_w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncoL9zUI7_w) (tl;dw - Waiting for the stock to dip? Good luck.)&#x200B;Stock was $339 then.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 14:20:53'] Currently bubbling and still with tens of millions shorted stocks. It might go further. Fair price targets vary wildly though, ranging from $10 to $500 with median at around $300.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 14:49:30'] Neither, they were correcting hard last year due to uncertainty. They were missing targets, which generally doesn't bode well.Then they fix their shit and deliver more than they estimated towards the end of the year, and so FOMO took over.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 14:59:57'] I‚Äôve been holding since 100. I do think it‚Äôs valuation is a bit crazy but that plant it China went from being built to putting its first car out in 10 months which is insane. So Europe is next? This stock is based on its current situation but on people expectation in the future. It probably go too far ahead of itself and will correct. I keep trying to pick a time to sell, wait, and get back in but timing shit is damn near impossible. I‚Äôll either do it or just hold through the ups and downs for 10-15 years
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 15:06:27'] Honestly, Tesla is a crazy company for my portfolio. I bought in at 80, I think electric cars are the future of transportation. That being said, I just sold my position.     Their market capitalization is crazy high, and they're on unstable ground. I work in industrial automation and analytics, having a good product is only half the battle. My gut reaction for the price is around 200. I believe they'll grow and become a better company, but they're not there now or in my opinion the near future. Investors have gone starry eyed over it, and that always leaves room for a huge downside
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 16:07:36'] They were way undervalued for the last few years as many shorts were expecting (hoping) model 3 production to break them. Now that they‚Äôre through that and the Y is coming out, people are starting to recognize the massive potential of its batteries, trucks, AI hardware and software, in car entertainment platform, global charging infrastructure. Basically Tesla will do to shipping, transportation, and energy what apple did to phones, music and websites.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 16:10:45'] The most consistent, predictable thing about Tesla is that its stock absolutely will go way up and way down, possibly more than any other. For years I invested almost solely in Tesla. Buy low, sell high. Then I gave $25,000 to a psychopath trying to save her from herself and haven‚Äôt recovered. Wah wah.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 18:51:06'] I bought two rounds at 170 and 230 and I‚Äôm still holding and loving the current price.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 19:07:29'] I sold off just before breaking 400 with my average at 215...kind of sucks, but the chat still needs to consolidate on the monthly time frame so I'm not sweating it. If I can buy back in under where I sold I will.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 19:19:36'] I would purchase some short term puts. This thing is riding 87 RSI, it‚Äôs gonna blow probably within next 5 days. It‚Äôll probably settle $440 area and then hit and run hit new highs.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 20:24:56'] I can see TESLA being a huge in the next few years. I bought at $225 ish and still have it. Going for long I can see Tesla reaching $1000-3000 a stock in about 2025.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 01:33:05'] So, I've seen some articles saying it is now the #1 car company in the world, as well as it just started shipping in china. I understand there is plenty of competition in china but when competition was announced for BYND this week their stock rose. I think we'll have to wait until quarterlys come out to truly see where it's headed. I think it's moving or has moved to where it should be. I think it will stay pretty steady at its current level, moving slightly up and down until something new comes from the company and big movements during reports times.

Tesla is the most expensive car manufacturer in the world. Who should be worth more? Toyota or Tesla?Pretty obvious what the answer is.

I did get it at 200 something but wish i had the chance to throw more at it
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-10 12:48:08'] You're hating life for making $100/share gain?  That's a 40% gain in a couple of months.   You can never time the market perfectly, it's pointless to even think about potential wins and losses.    If you worry about leaving gains on the table (especially on a stock you're up 50% on), its going to bite you in the ass eventually.   You got in at a good price, the stock went up and you sold for profit.    If you think the stock is still undervalued, buy another position.  Just dont get caught up by FOMO because you left gains on the table.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:52:37'] Tesla is also a data company. The amount of data being collected is absurd. Even if they stopped manufacturing all of their products, they still have a ton of valuable data.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 13:56:54'] They surpised earnings by 1,300%, so yea, it was ridiculously undervalued relative to earnings.However, their forward P/E is 84.17, so they are overvalued, so you would be investing in growth. Their growth is great.Technical indicators also show that its currently extremely overvalued, but shorting it would be a huge risk at this time.So no, it's not a bubble. It's just a prime example of a growth stock. All growth stocks eventually consolidate into value stocks, at which time the price will be well below its all-time high.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 04:27:04'] Dude. 98% in 3 months, 44% in 1 month...of course its a bubble. That doesnt mean Tesla isnt a valuable company, but its just hype right now, and for a lot of valid reasons.My guess is that it will come back down to a $350-$370 range.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 20:03:39'] Tesla is just getting started. In 50 years when they colonize Mars/monopolize Mars. We will all be kicking ourselves for not investing.That being said I still won‚Äôt invest in them. Something about the company seems off.

Ok I can confirm from past SEC filings that they raised money from equity recently and increase in shares outstanding.I may be old-fashioned still doing basic fundamental checks on companies but WHERE IS THEIR CASH FLOW STATEMENT?

Tech layoffs have a delayed effect on other workers, when the formerly well off tech workers buy less cars vacations and furniture. Even after interest rate hikes pause the Fed is still planning on reducing the money supply through open market sales.Jpow is on his way to legendary status 'tis true. I don't fear a bad recession.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 23:53:08'] The Fed isn't going to stop tightening until gdp growth either almost stops or contracts--they will not stop until there is broad demand destruction. There is typically a lag of 6 months to 2 years between a fed pivot and market lows--and the fed hasn't pivoted yet. Try again. It's possible everything turns bubblegum and rainbows, but it's more likely that this is a bull trap or a melt-up. Of course, price should always be your guide: if price continues to make higher highs and higher lows, then you get long. Me? I'll stay in cash except intra-day or for short 1-10 day swings.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 19:09:44'] The yield curve has inverted seven times since 1976. A recession followed within two years of the inversion in six of the seven instances. The median time leading up to a recession was 16 months.  How did markets perform following an inversion?  Market performance following inversion has been generally positive. The median return for the S&P 500 six months after inversion is 3.82% and 12.75% for the year after inversion.So ... you may be right that "the bulls have it in 2023", but I don't think it will be true that "peak recession is over" (although it may be quite some time before we see that it wasn't over).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 13:52:24'] Kind of amazing what can occur when the pressure is off‚Ä¶pretty clear now that a lot of what was behind December was tax loss selling now and that factor led to folks not being ready for an NDX over SPX type trade to work. Kinda similar to how the readiness was not there last January for the Fed to drop the hammer.But now that the S&P and Dow lost all of their outperformance that they had in the December tech puke vs the Nasdaq, I feel like we‚Äôre now at a crossroads that‚Äôs going to determine if whether a long-term bear (of the likes of the early 00‚Äôs, because to me, we‚Äôre not going to be discussing continuing inflation in the latter half of 2023) did indeed start in 2022, or if that was just a cyclical bear.And it‚Äôs going to be tricky because it makes sense to me to dip pretty soon. It‚Äôs probably either coming starting with the Fed this week (as much as I HATE this because it‚Äôs simply way too simple), or we probably wind up managing to tag the 4300‚Äôs, then reverse around Feb OPEX‚Ä¶but to me at the very least, the secular/long-term bear-nista believer is going to be greatly disappointed unless the S&P loses the March 2021 local lows again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 07:20:19'] At this point it‚Äôs not so easy to see a catalyst for a recession. Ukraine and Russia are going to remain at war. Inflation appears to be easing. The only other thing I can think of is household debt being at all time highs and the lack of mobility due to mortgages being astronomical. That said, down turns like to come as a surprise so maybe we‚Äôre close. I have no clue and I‚Äôm more confident no one else does either.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 07:36:01'] IMO this is So far from the truth, since debt feeling has been meet it will cause more money printing and higher inflation, not to mention if America looses its reserve as the petro dollar (on the horizon BRICS nations) we won‚Äôt be in a recession it will be the Great Depression 2.0

Plus, I don't think we even hit recession levels since the market has tanked.Earnings will be interesting this and next month. Profit margins are still shrinking compared to yoy, and inflation is still high. Layoffs will help, but to me, this has all just started in the last 6 months.I think this is all the beginning of a possible recession, but I am hopeful we don't get to that point. While I would be better off if it's a bull year financially, I still believe there will be another big downtrend before we start truly seeing signs that inflation is under control.  Plus, we still have the Russia and Ukraine war that could easily destroy the market if Russia uses nuclear weapons.

POST: ['2020-09-08 06:53:59'] POST TITLE: b"All those TSLA FOMO's out there, it may be the time to get in"
POST_TEXT: b'Every week for the past 8 weeks, I\'ve seen non-stop posts about how people are having great FOMO on TSLA. How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.\n\nEveryone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.\n\nWell, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $2500 pre-split).\n\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $2500.\n\nTo all those TSLA FOMO-er\'s, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the "company of the future" that has a valuation potential that can\'t be captured (ie. ARKK\'s perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).\n\nAdded fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered '

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 08:00:58'] SoftBank still has ~100,000 call options on TSLA, so about 10 million shares that could possibly be dumped at anytime.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 06:58:25'] PSA: they just diluted the stock through new offering, that it's at the pre-split insanity does not mean dilution has kicked in. Don't FOMO in until your indicators, strategy, research and DD indicate the stock is in a Buy Zone.Plenty of stocks in the market, TSLA is fire, play with care
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 14:03:25'] I was invested in QCOM in 1998 and many tech stocks during the 1st DOT-COM bubble.  SEBL, NTAP, CREE...all good companie. CREE, NTAP and QCOM still exist and are doing very well.  SEBL was bought by oracl maybe 7 to 10 years ago.But companies can do very well and still lose 90% of their stock value.  Every one of those stocks, and in fact the entire NASDAQ lost 90% of its value from its peak in the 2000 NASDAQ bubble.  Some of those companies have not seen their 2000 bubble stock prices despite running perfectly good companies and experiencing 2 more 'tech bubbles' in the preceding 20 years.NTAP has reached about half its 2000 stock price in the preceding 20 years, CREE about the same it looks like.  QCOM has done the best-- it just recently exceeded its 2000 all time high, but it took 20 years to do so, meaning if you bought the stock any time near its bubble peak and held through the crash thinking it would someday return a value, you would have been right.  After 20 years of holding,  in the last couple months you would have finally seen a small return, a much worse return than holding treasuries bonds, but not a loss I guess.The point is valuation does matter, and a business can be a good business and run perfectly fine and in a great environment for what it sells, but if you buy at an extreme premium you may not see a return on your money, even after holding for 20 years and that company performing its business well .TSLA may very well be a great company, but it seems like it is priced like as if its going to be the only car company in the world with high margins to boot.  It feels very much like QCOM to me- in fact QCOM split 4-1 after a relentless run up and then immediately began to tank, bringing the market down with it shortly after.QCOM had a patent on a tremendous and pioneering technology that other companies had to pay (and still do) royalties on, this was challenged and won in many court battles.  A technology that would go in billions of phones eventually and was/is a very well run business.  I don't even know if the same could be said for TSLA honestly, they may be well run, but they don't have a patent that they can force other companies to use or pay on..but in any case, that's beside the point.  The point is that valuations really do matter.  The average investor in 2000 because people were so heavily weighted in technology lost 85% of their portfolio value.  That takes a long time to recover from.  You have to make 100% gain if you lose 50% of your money, then suddenly you realize you are almost 50 years old....don't waste time, it feels like you have forever, but it goes fast, I promise.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 07:19:49'] In my opinion TSLA is one of the most overvalued stocks so now would NOT be a good time to buy, may Elon have mercy on my soul.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 07:14:44'] Tesla will definitely grow a lot in terms of revenue. But people need to check whether the potential revenue in future is worth the current market cap.Just see 1999-2010, you can see plenty of tech companies whose values didn't increase previous highs. Though their business kept on expanding.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 07:24:23'] Tesla is down 30% from their split-adjusted ATH of $2512.45. It was a 5:1 split, not 6:1.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 09:05:53'] I'm tired of seeing people say " THATS $1800 PRE SPLIT" you realize eventually the split will be irrelevant right ? They split for a reason. Apple split 4 times, people are very quick to forget that.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 06:59:41'] I have a feeling a lot of people new to the stock market are about to get burned here, the valuation of TSLA is so insanely high that I can absolutely trade lower than it is today 5 years for now, not saying that it will, but it can and that will be a very heavy bag to hold if youre not properly diversified.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 10:31:52'] "Now TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split)." That's not much of a crater, TBH.I didn't think it was a good deal the last time it was $1700, and don't think its a great deal at that price today.  Post split, I could imagine being really intrigued around $100/sh. And even that feels like FOMO land. But who knows, maybe they'll have produced another quarterly profit by then. Maybe that means I"ll be missing out in on the next run up, but I think the last few days have shown all that healthy skepticism in this market is warranted.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 14:36:43'] It‚Äôs going to drop to about $50 a share - mostly because I‚Äôm at the point of bag holding now and it‚Äôs a nice(terrible) learning lesson for my noob self.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 09:01:10'] When it drops to $70 or so, I'll consider getting in. Otherwise, it's still exhuberently high.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 09:34:18'] I love how some people have the need to tell others to get in in this leap of faith Tesla is, despite saying they have sure it will go up.If you're sure, just sit back and buy more shares, you don't need to convince anyone. Sooner or later, this enormous lie will blow up in your face, don't drag others with you.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-08 14:35:58'] These prices are way too high still in big tech.The trend was your friend until it's not.  Without the trend these stocks are going to plummet.  Just because it set valuations back a couple weeks, doesn't make them a good deal.  But you do the analysis yourself if the fundamentals of the company actually justify the price.  But actually look at the company, look at the fundamentals.  For all the "Tesla is more than a car company", everyone insisting it's a fast growing company are dead wrong.  It's revenue growth is pathetic compared to Amazon, Google, Facebook, Nvidia, etc.  Those others are all overpriced as well, but at least they are growing stronger.

Even the earnings report, where they made a profit THANKS to selling Regulatory Credits didnt prevent buyers from further pumping the price. Still better then NIKOLA though, which is a complete joke.This article presents an investment strategy for people wondering when is the right time to enter:[https://hubpages.com/money/Is-it-a-good-time-to-invest-in-TESLA](https://hubpages.com/money/Is-it-a-good-time-to-invest-in-TESLA)

POST_TEXT: b'I\'m 21, just began "steady" diluted investing 2 months ago into various companies (100+), with Tesla being the biggest holding.\n\nI was already feeling immense pain from the 70% gain, because I thought Ill have years to dca into my position under 900-ATH. Thinking about selling out due to its clear short term momentum overbought vibe, ended up opening an extremely lucky short pos on Friday that was slightly bigger than my share position cuz the stock looked like the momentum had a clear horizontal resistance. \n\nThe immense sell pressure next week would truly mean the discount of a lifetime for long term bulls, would it not?\n\nI mean, the company is the same, fundamentals are the same. Theres just heavy supply for a short period of time, changing the valuation. Honestly as a long term investor who is against this and why?'

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 15:34:23'] Yea over 100 companies is too diversified. As said, you should just buy an index at that point. Anyways Tesla is an interesting company (I've owned it before). Clearly overvalued yet the hype and perceived future value keeps it going. Definitely worth a buy on the dip if you're ok with the volatility (it could keep dipping).
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-06 15:33:25'] The fundamentals and the stock price do not coincide.

POST_TEXT: b'All, as many of you know that rivian had its first quarterly report this afternoon. The stock dropped about 5% after-market and I think it may present an interesting/attractive opportunity. Unlike NKLA, its CEO is an engineer who knows ins and outs of automotive engineering and have a good future outlook. The company is targeting ev suv and truck audience which is quite different than TSLA. I think this is a definitely long term investment like 5+ years before its full potential. What is your thought? Is it worth investing in this company?'

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-16 19:46:46'] I do not think it will be the next Tesla, but I do think Rivian will do well. This is not a very popular opinion as you can see from the other comments. There was a similar thread about this weeks ago, with almost all negative feedback.I think Rivian has potential for a few reasons. 1. They are targeting a customer base that is largely ignored by Tesla and other EV companies.2. They have contracts with the off-road race industry already, along with their own race circuit.3. They are making specialty vehicles for outdoor type people.4. Rivian is a more widely known name than many of the other non-Tesla EV companies.5. The Amazon contract is lucrative and does not mean that UPS, USPS, and FedEx will necessarily go with competitors.6. Comparing them to long time companies like Ford and GM is not really a fair comparison. Ford and GM aren't going anywhere, they are expanding on an already solid product line.Rivian would definitely be a long-term investment. While I do not think it will expand as much as Tesla did, I do think it will grow a lot. I am not an expert in stocks but think that there is more to choosing lucrative stocks than just the number crunching. There are real world parts that determine success and value.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-16 19:33:16'] There won‚Äôt be another Tesla. Rivian upshot is trucks, SUVs, Amazon delivery vans. The Amazon partnership imo could hurt them as Amazon competitors ups/fedex may be inclined to partner with a non Amazon house. Rivian will also be in direct competition with Ford & other EV trucks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-16 20:19:11'] Just a guess... but i think the answer will be no. Nice truck and good reviews. But I think no matter how much they try to increase output, I think over a short period of time Ford will be able to crank out more F150 Lightning trucks than all the other EV trucks together being produced at same time that the Lightning will contribute to keep the F150 the best selling Truck. Now I am not saying that Ford will be the next TSLA. I'm just saying their truck will outsell the rest. Every major manufacturer is showing some great cars coming out or soon to be coming out that there may never be another TSLA. TSLA may not be the same TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 19:16:26'] I have a hard time believing Apple will make a car.  Software, electronics, and AI for cars I can believe, but not a full vehicle.  It goes against Apple's very business model, which is high margin.  Tim Cook has gotten rid of profitable products simply because the margins are not high enough.  Right now Apple could make an Apple branded monitor with the same design motif as its laptops and sell tons of them.  It would not even have to stock them in Apple stores, maybe just a demo model with ordering online.  It got rid of monitors because the it is a low margin product.  In fact because of low margins, Cook has basically disassembled what used to be the Apple hardware ecosystem with its printers, routers, monitors, and such.It does not make sense for Apple to get into a business that requires huge capital outlays, is very cyclical, and often has low to no profits

It took Tesla 10 yrs trials and errors to mass produce an economical EV and Tesla still has car quality issues besides the industry wide battery safety issue. I just don't see how those phone companies can catch up quickly. Yes they know infotainment, software, telecommunications better than traditional car manufacturers for sure, but they have never had any experience building a robust car. On the other hand, traditional car manufacturers aren't just waiting there to be disrupted - they are working really hard to reinvent their own industry right now.

With Apple or Tesla you will sell your car without the most important features like self driving. We should buy electric car from legacy maker. Alternative: Tesla and Apple car should be way cheaper to account for less resale value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 23:54:53'] esla's you have to take them to them to get them fixed, and I would imagine apple will be the same way, so neither. I'm gonna stick to public transportation for now, and if I do ever get a car, it will be one that I can shop around for mechanics when something goes wrong.&#x200B;As much as I like Tesla, the idea that you should have to wait a month for a part is ridiculous, many many people with a car need it to get to work, and if they don't have their car they can either uber/rent a car or be fired for not showing up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-10 19:49:29'] AAPL for sure. Why would I buy a Tesla ? The cars are so ugly anyways. If I wanted style I would rather buy BMW or Audi. If I wanted cheap I‚Äôll buy Japanese. So AAPL wins against TSLA
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 06:53:28'] I would buy an Apple car because Apple‚Äôs entire business model isn‚Äôt based on fraud and the charisma of an autistic huckster

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:09:34'] UNHUnited Health is a steady rocket ship. Check out the chart since about 2008. It‚Äôs not a sexy stock but it‚Äôs a true money maker especially if you want a long term position.  Its stock chart looks like a high flying tech stock, not like an insurance stock. Here‚Äôs why this is so good and any health insurance stock for that matter. When Obama came into office he created Obamacare.  Obama care basically allowed the health insurance companies to write alot of the current government regulations.  One thing they actually created as a result of all this new legislation is technically ‚Äúprice fixing‚Äù. While they will never admit to this, this is the reality. Price fixing is illegal in every industry and companies get fined for it all the time. In this case, basically the government is signing off on this so called price fixing although they will never call it that.How do I know this you might ask. Well I spent over 20 years in the investment industry and was self employed for most of that time and a lot of my clients were some of the biggest brands in the investment industry.  But that‚Äôs not really why I know this. I know this because I was and still am a business owner and I have had to buy a lot of health insurance over the years.  Prior to Obamacare the health insurance market was competitive, you could shop around to get the best deal. When my existing health insurer would jack up our rate on the renewal, we would just switch carriers and it would bring the rate back down. Obamacare eliminated that competition among insurers. So now when my health insurer jacks my rate every year and I go look for another insurance carrier, they are oddly at the same jacked up rate my current insurer is at. So no longer a cost saving benefit to switching carriers and we‚Äôre forced into annual increases no matter what.The health insurance companies have been claiming they struggle financially but if you look at the chart. There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs the case. Their charts are more like high flying tech companies but with a couple of main differences‚Ä¶ low to cheap P/E ratios and a government backed price fixing theme with recurring locked in revenues that grow on top of themselves year after year. Just food for thought and sorry for the long dissertation‚Ä¶ lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:05:32'] United Microelectronics (UMC) will see some short-term pain, but already trade at a discount and are well-positioned and growing in automotive and communications.With the capacity to ship 10 million wafers a year, a relatively bulletproof balance sheet, a likely to be fat dividend (if they return the same % of earnings as they did last year it'll be ~10% yield), and additional capacity coming online in Taiwan as well as Singapore over the next couple of years I really like their odds of returning to strong growth in the medium term. That being said I do intend to wait for another dip before adding again since I have a decent chunk already and 1H23 looks pretty shaky.

POST_TEXT: b" \n\nTesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.\n\nWhile Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this years New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. \n\n## Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack\n\nTesla who, Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.\n\nThe impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on on"

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 05:59:09'] how are they losing their dominance... of course there is competition, but they are so far ahead of the curve at this point.  they produce their own batteries and have the resources to keep expanding that business.  they'll be selling equipment to the major manufacturers at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-14 00:34:30'] The analysis  against Tesla has been going on since the beginning. While GM and Ford have been closing factories for lack of computer chips, Tesla has been racking up record sales every quarter.  In 2022, they sold double the amount of card in 2020.One reason is the technology dominance used in Tesla manufacturing.  The other is they own their own supply chain. About the only thing not owned is the battery.  Chip issues impacted Tesla too, but they rewrote the software for the chips they could get. They also could do this because they didn't outsource their programmers, something just about every car company was doing to save money. Their future EV cars will be built on the gas powered car's manufacturing processes.  I could go on and on. &#x200B;\*Note:  I don't own a Tesla. But I am a programmer for a tech company. I own Tesla stock.

You are aiming for % of total AUTO share because your largest market isn't current EV buyers but getting the guy who wants to purchase an Audi or BMW ICE vehicle.Hyundai IONIQ 6 is a nice vehicle. The problem is it is an unsustainable business model. They are not profitable and sell few units. If the objective was to sell few units and lose money selling a good EV, Hyundai is winning. Chevy Bolt, lol. I love how you use forecasted Chevy Bolt sales for the year versus Tesla current Q1 sales. Why do you not use the forecasted Tesla sales for the year? Instead you want to make it seem close by comparing a quarterly amount versus the yearly amount? FYI, Tesla is expected to do 1.8-1.9 million EV sales for 2023. Chevy Bolt is expected to do 70,000 for 2023. In which way is this close?Tesla is cutting prices because during COVID when everyone had money, they continued to increase the prices of their vehicles. With a looming recession and economic downturn with higher rates, it was unsustainable for Tesla to sell their vehicles at that same price. It's common sense. "Cybertruck isn't out yet."Literally coming out by this year."Model 2 unknown date."  Expected to release within the next year or two considering Tom Zhu has said they expect Giga Monterrey to start operating quicker than Shanghai (which only took \~year to begin manufacturing vehicles.) If they manage to do this, no other auto company will come close and be profitable selling a $25k EV outside of maybe BYD (which doesn't really report EV numbers separately so it's tough to say for sure).
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 06:09:04'] EVs are going to become the main type of vehicle world wide.  For Tesla to retain their EV market share, they would have to end up with half the world total auto market.  Of course that isn't going to happen.Tesla is continuing to grow their actual sales at a strong rate, but expecting them to keep almost the entire EV market is silly.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 04:17:39'] Ford and GM will be out of business within 3 years, prolly sooner. Every other ICE manufacturer  will be lucky to survive 5 years. Tesla's lead and progress is accelerating, there will be no plateau in progress and development for at least annother10 years. Tesla is already massively in front on nearly every metric. No other manufacturer has anything in the way of battery capacity production to meet any substantial goals of production. BYD is producing more EV's but there margins are super slim, once the $25,000 Tesla comes out and Cyber truck and semi's start rolling out it's game over for everyone else. A new Mega factory being built in China to double even triple mega pack production. A new factory in Mexico and another new factory to be announced soon in prolly Malaysia(?) Each new factory being streamlined and honed to perfect production and efficiency.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 05:06:31'] Anything I‚Äôve seen written about Tesla by an automotive engineer says under the skin the car is miles ahead of any other EV. Most other OEMs are losing tons of money on their EV expansion. Meanwhile Tesla has been minting margins other car manufacturers haven‚Äôt seen in decades with an ROE of over 30%. That massive free cash flow is largely being reinvested back into R&D and capex in order to continue to grow faster and stay technologically ahead of everyone else.2021 sales grew 70% and 2022 grew 50%. Looks like estimates are for 25-30% growth this year off an already high base. Add on to this that unlike every other OEM they have almost no advertising or distribution help to achieve these results. So as far as I can see the numbers don‚Äôt tell me that Tesla is losing anything. At most you can say they don‚Äôt have a 100% monopoly on full size EVs. Full disclosure: I have no investments in TSLA or any other OEM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-13 07:33:50'] Yes, Tesla will continue to lose market share in an industry that is growing exponentially.  It wasn't long ago that the EV market was a niche market that was dominated by Tesla.  Keep in mind that as other players, including legacy car manufacturers, increase their EV offerings, Tesla's market share will continue to erode.  Would you care to make a bet on who the top EV manufacturer will be in ten years?  I would bet the answer is Tesla, although they will likely produce a minority of EVs by then.  Also, in ten years most new cars will be EVs, so we have gone from TSLA being the only significant player in a tiny market five years ago to TSLA still being the top producer in a market that includes most retail automobiles.Both things can be true, Tesla can lose market share while still growing at a very high rate because the industry is in its infancy.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 21:30:36'] I recently started a position off this dip and can see this hitting that $100 by eoy. It has consistent free cash flow and has been on a steady growth trajectory the past 5 years. I don‚Äôt see any reason to be worried and the downside protection is what drew me to this investment. Aggressive buybacks, record low valuation, margin expansion, strong balance sheet, and new product offering in SMB. If it drops more from here it will only strengthen my conviction.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 19:25:04'] Visa and MasterCard are in another category. They own the networks on which all credit card transactions travel. So if you use a credit card on Paypal, they have to pay V or MA. That is why those companies go at a premium. V has an 80% gross margin vs 40% for PayPal. You might want to change your comps for valuation. Also, stocks are not something to get depressed about. It's not fun to lose money, but every investor has done it. Even Buffett. So, even if it never makes it to your average price, it's ok. There will be other opportunities.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 21:09:40'] Let me give you some good advice friend.Lets say you have 100k invested into a stock, say PayPal. It drops 50% in value and you're sitting at 50k. You held your 50k for awhile but the stock isn't doing much and you're worried. You obviously don't want to lose 50k, but it's already gone mate.Now you can either let that 50k sit there and maybe the stock rebounds eventually in a few years, or you can take that 50k and put it in something that is actually moving up, say, anyone who says the word AI. In a few months, that 50k could be 70k in say, Google, DraftKings, Meta, etc, or you can sit there in PayPal, with it still at 50k in a few months.Here's the thing bud. You clearly don't have faith in PayPal like you used to. You need to learn how to sell. Ask yourself this. Do you think Paypal will perform better than other stocks? Obviously your answer is no, so why are you holding PayPal? You're missing out on way better gains out there.Something retail investors love to do. They cut their winners and hold their losers. That.. *is a losing strategy my friend.*edit: To put it in another way.. Money invested into stocks are fluid. Liquidity, right? Well.. you're playing a solid in a liquid world if you don't sell/trade out your bad investments. The only stocks you should be holding, are ones you feel *bullish* on.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 18:22:15'] I was very close to pulling the trigger on PYPL before the earnings/ reaction. I held off because the reaction after hours made me think harder about ‚Äòwhy‚Äô. What I came up with became the narrative the next day: their segment has become commoditized. It was the only explanation for the multiple the market was assigning given the other factors such as growth/growth potential, etc. The only reason that hadn‚Äôt been obvious to me before was because the pandemic run-up was clouding my vision. What that means is that the company will henceforth be judged upon the strength of their hold on their percentage of the payments market (against monopolies like AAPL & others) and their ability to grow the bottom line through cost controls. Can they get back to $100 - yes. As soon as they‚Äôre making around $7- $7.5 per share GAAP. My 2 cents. Good luck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-22 17:08:59'] I'm just hoping it gets back over $1050 after earnings, but this year has been brutal so far. That dead cat bounce we had on Thursday might have shattered all hopes for a lot of people. Crypto is also taking a dump....Tesla is killing it on all fronts. It just might not translate into an increase in share price. I don't think people should be comparing the Netflix situation to Tesla, since Netflix gave shitty guidance and growth FOR THEM is slowing down. But ANY perceived negative comments on the earnings call could tank this. Elon could say everything is going great, factories are coming on line and they'll build 1.8M vehicles this year, but if he says, "ya the supply chain is a pain in the ass" or if Powell says "50 basis points, QT imbound" then we could have the same crash we had last year, maybe worse.I'll take $1,500 though...

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 06:53:32'] I honestly think the best thing for Tesla at this point is to get a new CEO, Elon‚Äôs brand is a net negative when it used to be a net positive. Real serious institutional investor don‚Äôt care about Twitter drama, they want to feel confident that their CEO is focusing on their investment (Tesla)I‚Äôve held Tesla for years in the past, because I loved the tech, but then it became a meme-stock, Elon became obsessed with Twitter politics, & crypto shenanigans. There‚Äôs a lot of increasing competition in the EV space. Tesla may have had a head-start but they can loose ground if they don‚Äôt maintain focus. Teslas are infamous for manufacturing quality being inconsistent, which is something more and more consumers are becoming aware about as they look to buy their next vehicle. Also recent PR and controversies regarding their self-driving AI is not a good look for Tesla.I will never short Tesla, but I‚Äôve sold for a really good profit, and not looking to buy back in anytime soon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-14 08:04:18'] It is widely believed that the valuation of Tesla is a bit lofty to say the least. We will have to wait for the history books to open to see the full picture of what happened in 2020 that made the stock go 10x in a matter of months. If you check the [insider transactions](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:TSLA/insiders) or [earnings chart](https://markets.sh/symbols/NASDAQ:TSLA) of the last couple months, it could be argued that we will see a much more realistic valuation of maybe a 20 P/E going forward with a stock price around 80-100. This would still assume a massive amount of growth and turn a blind eye on the giant Capex that lie ahead of Tesla. My guess is, that similar to SpaceX, Musk will not do the CEO anymore and have more of an advisory / tech role. Tesla is saved from existential threat after all and should be able to exist just as successfully without being tied to Musks public persona so closely.

Once companies integrate they are kind of committed to the service. I am in the business and these are great products. In a recession and high interest rate environment these companies will face headwinds on adopting but for the companies already on board these services allow them to target resources more efficiently. If you investing for years out I think these are good stocks if you can get them on dips. If you swing or day trading might not be the best. Maybe SNOW is good for trading for the wild price swings but I think 4 or 5 years out these 3 are home runs if you go long

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 19:07:48'] VW is the only one that‚Äôs really serious. EVs will replace gas cars in the passenger vehicle market in the next ten years, with China and Europe ahead of the US. There is going to be plenty of room for VW, Tesla, and other car companies. Tesla energy and probably software are going to be massive businesses for them also. As a shareholder I still do have concerns, the stock is way out ahead of itself and a bunch of traders and probable weak hands have jumped in. Also Tesla really needs to invest in their service department, and quality control in manufacturing still a concern. But for all his shortcomings, Elon musk really is sort of a visionary genius and is running circles around these paper pusher traditional automotive and energy executives. Without Tesla none of these auto companies would have even planned to seriously move on EVs by now, and renewable energy plus storage wouldn‚Äôt have near the same momentum. Tesla is defining the future for these industries, everyone else is following their lead.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 19:11:08'] You make a good point, especially about Hyundai.  Their engineering prowess dwarfs that of Tesla's.  When they want to do something, they do it.  They sell vehicles with ten year warranties, profitably.  Think about that.  Then think about the fact Tesla is constantly at the bottom of quality rankings.  Several years ago I had the same theory you propose: that monsters like Toyota and GM could use their auto making scale to squeeze Tesla.  Yet they sat and did nothing... for years.  They gave this huge lead role to Tesla.  Still, it feels different now.  EV is part of the public consciousness.  Older relatives are actively seeking out EV's and hybrids from their favorite old fashioned brands, even though it makes zero sense for them. Tesla reminds me of how Netflix and Amazon ran up big numbers, but people overlook the fact they each were doing so against zero competitors.  Tesla has had no real competition... so far.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 16:23:15'] Yes, and this is coming from a Tesla shareholder (though one with a more recently reduced allocation to them) - people will say they are years ahead of the competition, and this is true, but the likes of Toyota, GM, Nissan, and Hyundai sell a lot more vehicles than a company like BMW, despite BMW being ahead of them on tech. It's as simple as people not always wanting to pay for tech, like in China they'll gladly take a Nio with slightly worse range for $10 grand less...and once these other manufacturers get above the low bar required to really compete on full electric, they will eat into market share. Whether Tesla can outdo them in manufacturing efficiency so they can compete on cost as well as anyone is yet to be seen, but building vehicles there are only so many places that efficiencies can be gained, and a lot of companies have gotten really good at wringing out those efficiencies.Also, listen to Musk at the battery day, the goal of Tesla is not to generate massive profits, it's to generate just enough profits to stay in business. While this is good from a reinvestment standpoint, and thus staying ahead of the curve, it doesn't scream earnings growth. In terms of AI, the big question is whether Tesla is really almost at level 5, and whether we will ever get to level 6. I'm still a believer but my outlook is realistic, a bit tempered, and takes risk into account. Like you have to realize that expectations for them have been set so high that if they aren't utterly dominating in coming years it will be deemed a failure. Their stock price has basically gone full No Man's Sky, so now they need to deliver on the hype. And they might, worth owning some for that. But I sure as hell wouldn't put 80% of my net worth into them.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 16:31:09'] No.The market is right at the tipping point of witnessing a massive shift towards EVs. Tesla is poised to capitalize on this growth WITHOUT sacrificing declining sales of ICE vehicles (unlike every other legacy automaker).For example, Tesla‚Äôs closest competitor VW, will see its legacy business shrink as its EV business expands. This is fine for VW, as it won‚Äôt hurt the bottom line as long as EV growth keeps pace with its declining ICE sales. But Tesla will experience growth from rapid EV adoption without having its core business shrink into oblivion.Even if the legacy automakers are able to make competitive EVs, the widespread and rapid adoption of EVs mean that Tesla could lose a percentage of marketshare and still increase its sales by astronomical levels. This is what happened with the iPhone. It lost marketshare to its competitors over the past ten years. How much did that hurt Apple‚Äôs phone business? None. In fact, it‚Äôs phone business grew significantly and made them a ton of money. The share price of Apple has risen accordingly.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 05:34:10'] VW is the only one that's actually serious about EVs. I wouldn't call it all in, but at least they're somewhat in. Saying GM is all in is just a joke, and even if they would go all it's like an 18th century printing press operator going all in on eBooks. They don't even have the knowledge to do so effectively.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 06:10:22'] More importantly did people see the recent recalls from Tesla? Do people consider quality control an issue given the recent ramp up? I don‚Äôt own a Tesla car. Does anyone in tech know how much ahead their battery technology is? I feel like people just say it‚Äôs really ahead, but don‚Äôt provide justification.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 08:55:03'] Theres a lot of bias here as usual when asking about tesla. I recommend mixing your search criteria up a bit and looking at car publications and not just investing and tesla subs on reddit. Currently, tesla only has 1/10 of the top 10 selling EVs on the world. In the Next year, 145 new EVs are being released (and not a single one will be a tesla) as well. Tesla doesnt even currently own the 2% market that EVs make of of new cars sales and people in here are a ting like they have decades head start. Its bullshit.  Ar companies haven't bothered with EVs until now because development costs haven't been worth it for such a small market. Thats changing now. Also, unlike tesla, other makes won't release a product until its actually ready for consumers
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 16:51:30'] Tesla's market cap is ridiculous. People should be.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 17:23:31'] Volkswagen is really the only company that is taking EV seriously. I Believe if GM, Ford and many other manufacturers don't embrace EV, they will go under.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 15:04:33'] No.Tesla has had so many years head start. Its gonna take a long time for ANYONE else to catch up. Not to mention the rate of innovation at Tesla is unparalleled.If you know anything about the EV industry, you know that Tesla has a better product than anyone. Thats even true when applied retroactively a few years. Cars that Tesla made back in 2017 are STILL better than any other EV on the road TODAY.Tesla will be the frontrunner for EV's for years to come.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 14:23:21'] No

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-29 12:00:49'] Tesla‚Äôs failure in Europe is eye opening and could be a sign of things to come. Their poor quality control was acceptable when they were a novelty but the bar is rapidly rising and they don‚Äôt seem like they are keeping up.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 15:31:25'] They are years behind
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 15:46:31'] No.GM may be making headlines about going all in on EV's, but if you read what they're actually promising it's very pathetic.GM says they'll have [**30** new models of EV's on the market by 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html). And yet GM also saysAnd yet GM said they intend to sell only **1 million** EV's globally by **2025**. [Linki](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/03/general-motors-expects-to-sell-1-million-evs-globally-by-mid-decade/)That averages out to 33,333 sales per EV model, which is downright pathetic for anything but an ultra expensive luxury model.And this isn't even considering how much trouble GM is going to be in if the market shifts in mass away from ICE vehicles before 2025 due to rapidly falling battery prices bringing down the costs of EV's.A lot of the other automakers are in just as bad a situation as GM, with similarly bad projections for future years.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 15:38:18'] No, and they will face a lot of the challenges off other EV manufacturers. Telsa has a massive lead.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 15:38:22'] No
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 14:29:08'] The spotlight is on tsla now cause join in S&P 500. Do your research. Also, Tesla has better technologies in the car then any other auto manufacturers. People now a day want more than just a car. High tech can grab people‚Äôs attentions
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 14:44:37'] The short answer is no. I have stop losses set up just in case the market wants to correct itself for some reason. Even if those are hit I'd buy back in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 16:46:58'] Statistically speaking there's nothing wrong with buying stocks at "present" all time highs. That being said, the PE ratio on TSLA is unsustainable imo.. that tells me a long consolidation period is possible.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 17:50:54'] I honestly think it will split again. Elon wants to keep it under 1k he really wants it in that 300 range. This is so people don't feel intimidated to invest.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 16:23:27'] 600 dollars was the peak earlier this year and now it‚Äôs at 1200. You can always DCA if it crashes. If your plan is to hold and not make a quick profit, you might not lose on the investment if you purchase a few stocks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 16:32:48'] I had a good friend that was 'The Guy' in March of 09.  As a retiree he couldn't stand the losses in his Smith Barney account which had his entire retirement fund so sold it all in March of 09.  I don't remember the exact day but it was actually the day the market bottomed.  Went to all cash which is where he stayed.  Moved from a large house in North Scottsdale to a small house in a town far outside of Phoenix to regenerate some savings, but clearly he can be defined as being 'The Guy.'   I have absolutely no idea what the top will be in the SPY or TSLA, but somebody will end up being 'The Guy' there also.  This euphoria/insanity can go on for a long time or it could end tomorrow.    If I were a betting man I would bet it will continue for a bit.If you are young enough and hold long enough you will make money.   100 years ago the DJs was at 75.  Today at near 36,000.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-04 20:35:18'] I have asked the same exact question. I can compare this to a similar situation with apps. Came out with company changing news (partnership with Google, eliminated the threat of Google decimating them), and the stock tanked. Tesla is not a normal stock i have come to learn. It goes up on both good and bad news. Basically any news will move the stock. I remember last year, the story with the driver who burned alive in the car. The stock went up after that a accident. I have friends who only own one stock(Tesla) and will continue to only own one stock until they die. They are Tesla fanboys and i cannot change their view.

Today we have exactly the opposite. Price fall almost 12% because one of the 3 factories will remain closed for 14 days and work the remaining 17 days of the month. I wonder what impact would have to stock if any major car rental company announced that they signed agreement to purchase 50 or 100K cars.

POST_TEXT: b">SHANGHAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Tesla [**(TSLA.O)**](https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O) cut electric car prices in China for the second time in less than three months on Friday, stoking expectations for a wider price war for battery-powered vehicles in the world's largest auto market where demand has weakened.  \n>  \n>Tesla also cut prices on its best-selling Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles in Japan, [**South Korea**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/prices-some-tesla-models-cut-south-korea-official-2023-01-06/) and Australia.  \n>  \n>The coordinated price cuts were part of an effort to help stoke demand for Tesla's output at its Shanghai factory, the company's single largest production hub, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan.  \n>  \n>It was also the first major move by the electric vehicle maker since Tesla appointed its lead executive for China and Asia, Tom Zhu, who has been based in Shanghai, to [**oversee global output and deliveries.**](https://www.r"

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 04:40:14'] Is today the day that TSLA drops back below $100?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 02:17:59'] Tesla makes 9.2k on average from their cars. The discount for the Model 3 in China alone is around 6k, and even higher for their higher end models.Given that most of their money was made in China anyway, that is a 65% margin decline on the Chinese market right here. So Tesla needs to grow 200% in China just to keep earnings even.According to Troy Teslike on Twitter (who is a Tesla bull), the backlog has gone down hugely. My prediction last year was that Tesla would stop growing in H1 2023, with margins declining starting in Q2 2023. I am still sticking to that. The share price correction can get really ugly here if that comes true.Edit: corrected decline
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 05:07:12'] Will be extremely interesting to see what happens to their margins in Q4 and Q1. They have a ton of headwinds and tailwinds in terms of margins recently, almost impossible to predict what will happen.Tailwinds:* Bigger economies of scale* Negative margins from Berlin/Texas flipping positive* Material costs coming back down to 2019 levels* FSD NA-wide release one-time deferred revenue recognition* FSD NA-wide release probable increase in adoption and definite increase in immediate recognition on new FSD sales* Increasing numbers of MIC sales outside of China (more profitable than sales inside China, especially after price cuts)* Inventory decrease in EU/NA* Larger share of production coming from more efficient factories* Continuous cost cutting on manufacturing techniques* IRA incentives on ~50% of NA sold units (not technically going to Tesla, but may increase demand and allow price increases)* IRA incentives on battery production (may not go into effect until Q2 though)* Model S/X being sold outside of NA again* No more SBC from CEO compensation planHeadwinds:* 60K units in transit at end of quarter, expected to grow even further for 1-3 more quarters (unlike legacy OEMs, Tesla doesn't recognize a sale until delivery)* Discounts during last two weeks of December worldwide* Price cuts in China in October and January* Declining regulatory credits* Soon to be announced new factory investments* COVID issues in China factory in December* Chinese New Year shutdown in China factory in February* Potentially looming recession and high interest rates may slow demand globallyProbably forgot a few, but it's nearly impossible to say anything worthwhile about what the ultimate effect will be. If I had to guess, I'd expect margins to come down a bit during Q4 and even more during Q1 down to, and then start trending upwards again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 05:59:16'] They just cut prices for the second time in 3 months in China for a total 18% price cut. Chinese made Model 3 now costs equivalent of $33.5k and Model Y the equivalent of $38.9k. At these low prices, it will sell like hotcakesInteresting to note that the prices in China 2.5% lower for Model 3 and 5.8% lower for Model Y than July 2021, so this seems to be at least partially a normalization after a rapid increase in prices.

POST_TEXT: b'On average TSLA has gone up $67.1/day since the announcement of the stock split. Market hours are open 6.5 hours each day. Each hour is about $10.32 so for every minute you spend asking reddit if you should buy, youve lost $0.17/share. Dont question the meme stock. It actually has a product that is in high demand and the stock went nowhere in the previous 10 years (floated around $100-400) and at the time, it was undervalued because 99% of people didnt understand it.\n\nEdit: this post is NOT suggesting to buy now. But its also not suggesting to sell or wait for the dip to buy either. Make your own decisions. The risk is very high. If you invest now, it could go up another 5-10% to only drop 30%. No one knows at this point. Theres a lot of catalysts coming up in September like battery day and Q3 earnings. Dont be surprised if we see a sell off before or immediately after. Theres very high expectations for the million mile battery. \n\nAs always, do your own research and invest based'
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 07:13:49'] I have one share and am holding it.  Not adding, not selling, not doing anything.  Just holding it.  Screwed around with tesla back at the $700s and settled on one share.  I lost money on fear and nervousness.  Decided it was enough risk for me and holding will now reward me.  This is what I have learned from Tesla.  Buy, hold and drown out the noise.  Could I have made more $$ by buying? Absolutely! Would I have lost more sleep wondering if I will?  Definitely!  I valued my mental health more than my portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 16:35:20'] I truly believe TSLA will blow past 1K very fast after the split. That's not just a random guess, I think people want that connection to SpaceX, and Star Link. They feel that holding, and even buying more TSLA gives them that warm fuzzy connection they need to be part of Elon's empire.It's just my opinion, and of course I got in early, and I'm holding on for the ride like some of you. It will be a fascinating, and rewarding thing to be a part of, and talk about again someday.Good luck to us brave ones!
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-22 03:35:30'] Hahaha what a great title. I got in at $1300 and although I knew it defied logic , I knew it would rally for whatever reason again and there it goes. Sold at 2k.

Even when it looked like they were coming into a dip, they just bounced off of some non-existent support and blasted even higher. Lots of catalysts for tesla in the coming months which could mean a rush for shares at the split, but the trend with everything lately seems to be a sharp sell-off around post-split market open, then a buy back after at lower avg.

Self driving cars are wayyyy further away than everyone thinks. I‚Äôd say at least 20 years. I‚Äôm willing to bet all these cars are going to be cheaper than teslas. If you honestly think Tesla is the only company that can make a battery then you are a fool. Slow and steady wins the race. These large companies don‚Äôt move at rapid speed but once they get going they will take over the market so I would be very careful with how long you hold. Tesla is extremely overvalued, running on almost entirely hype and a little bit of fundamentals.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 22:22:00'] Msft seems the most stable, but also with potential for upside. MS office won't go away, Cloud etc. Seems like a solid choice.Goog and Meta might have problems with privacy laws. Meta management is shit.Aapl would be solid too, but imo more can change for them compared to msft.Amzn is too overvalued imo.Semi conductors don't seem to bad either, but overvalued and I wouldn't want to bet on one single company.

During the next 5 years I see an economic recovery so the stock going back up to it's pre-pandemic level.(current dividend would get me a little over 3 grand over the 5 years.  if the stock price goes up $20 gets me another 3 grand.  if it goes up $40 to the pre pandemic level I've almost doubled the money.  Not to mention their dividend would probably go back up to pre-pandemnic level and the 3 grand in div would be higher as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-16 23:51:58'] SoFi. Wouldn't be surprised if this is perceived as one of the most risky stocks among the recommendations, but I think the upside potential is enormous and I love using their products. Because of their status quo breaking initial offerings/welcome bonuses/great marketing, 50% of the people I recommend SoFi to switch from their current banks and every single one (only 8 so obviously minimal sampling) has sung it's praises to me. Them upping their apy on checking and savings every few weeks since I switched last year has been mind blowing and competitively significant. The company and products are easy to love and they are growing rapidly so I gotta hope the stock performs accordingly.

They will do good if we face sub-optimal economic growth and higher-than-average inflation which is where we're heading towards in my opinion.If we're seeing another round of the 70s, energy companies will outperform over the next few years.

The world will build up massive amounts of storage for renewables over the next ten years (at least) and anyone who has a turnkey solution and can deliver in a timely manner at scale will make bank.Plus, I like that they are constantly innovating and trying to break into new markets - or even creating new markets from scratch - instead of doing 'same old, same old' like everyone else.

He is widely known as the "father of value investing", and wrote two of the foundational texts in neoclassical investing: Security Analysis (1934) with David Dodd, and **The Intelligent Investor (1949)**.  Throughout his career, Graham had many notable disciples who went on to receive substantial success in the world of investment, including Irving Kahn and Warren Buffett, the latter going on to describe him as the second most influential person in his life after his own father. Another one of Graham's famous students was Sir John Templeton.  **Warren Buffett describes The Intelligent Investor as "the best book about investing ever written."** Graham exhorted the stock market participant to first draw a fundamental distinction between investment and speculation.

It's really cheap from a P/E perspective which reflects that the market thinks they'll lose significant market share.  The worst case scenario is kind of already priced in.So it leaves you with a very realistic upside risk IMO.Plus: even if they loose market share (I think they will, a little), the Cloud market is growing exponentially (demand) whereas CPU/GPU performance is no longer growing exponentially, so the CPU market will have to grow exponentially as well, follow my logic?  There's going to be a need for MUCH more CPU in the future.Also: In the meantime, you get paid a very nice dividend, so even if the stock doesn't grow, you've made money.I've read their last i5 is faster than the best AMD by the way, but that's not even my point.

POST_TEXT: b"I'm torn. On the one hand, stocks are still down from their ATHs, but on the other, there's a pending recession, issues with banks, tech layoffs, and we're still waiting for the hikes to make their way through the economy. It's tough to make sense of all this. If I didn't have a large sum to invest, I'd DCA without a second thought. In my view, though, this is a bubble. Evaluations are too high for me, but maybe I'm missing something or not looking forward? Of course NVDA etc are way overvalued right now but the rest of the market still seems a little expensive. Are we just waiting for it to be burst? What do you guys think? Bubble or no bubble?"

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 20:35:17'] I think we are in, how do you say, a bubble but a bubble with many smaller bubbles within in it. Sort of like a large bubble encasing many smaller ones. Anyone of these bubbles popping could cause a contagion effect. What is concerning is the fact this economy has been injected with cash from the actions due to the pandemic. Was injecting cash a good thing? Eh, hindsight is 20/20..am I right? Rhetorical of course, we simply don‚Äôt 100% know. I do know many folks and businesses alike are using these funds, wages and savings to push up the market all while collecting money from these investments. Might be an explanation to where some of the missing work force went. It‚Äôs very interesting using analytics and techniques to review market data but it‚Äôs human behavior at the core. Right now everyone who has skin in the game are at best trying to find what will pop first. With so much fear and confusion it‚Äôs like the fed thinks we need something familiar to happen in the market to know which way is up. IMO not gonna happen. This inflation is going to stick. Why? Too much money chasing too few goods. Slap the working force and unemployment goes up. Thing is, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the working class with the money. So I see high unemployment and moderate inflation 4-5%, but a big demand in growth for services. So I‚Äôll call it Flowflation. Ew, how do we get out of this? Policy to detach from energy costs and dare I say it drop interest rates and some how get the rich closer to us in terms of income. I‚Äôm also skeptical that something is lurking in the shadows of some heavy weight countries. That‚Äôs my Ted talk thanks for reading üôè
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:20:32'] The problem is that we are in a market that does not understand reality of economics anymore. It is a pure gambling machine based on technical analysis. https://talkmarkets.com/content/nasdaq-bitcoin-gold-among-beneficiaries-of-falling-rates-expectations?post=389768This is an article that sends shivers down my spine. First this part:"The market is thus betting that we have reached a peak in terms of rate hikes and that from here looser monetary policy should follow.The Fed, SNB, and BoE all hikes interest rates this week, but the message from these banks was the same: more increases may be required, not will be if inflationary pressures persist."Where on earth are people getting this idea? The Fed is doing something rather clever. They are providing liquidity at ever increasing rates. Meaning you can have money, but it will cost you. They are completely misunderstanding looser monetary policy.Secondly, the idea that you can read the market as an uptrend because of some technical analysis is ludicrous. Technical analysis works until it does not work, and then it does not work really badly. People have since 2008 only seen a market that goes up. That is scary as it implies we have a generation of "investors" that don't understand that markets can go down hard.It will burst, but it will be death by a thousand cuts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 15:23:20'] One simple argument against 'bubble' is that p/e is at 20x. That is a little high by historical standards, but hardly extreme. The valuation of the market is fundamentally reasonable as it is backed by earnings. A 'bubble' occurs when an asset is being bid up by speculation and becomes detached from fundamentals. That is not the case here. Some argue future earnings will go down. Maybe. But where we are right now is not a bubble

Let's talk about how they bailed out Solar City.  How their self-driving features pale in comparison to Waymo.  How the patents of their biggest advantage, their batteries, were given away for free.  How pretty much no car companies have seriously tried to make a good EV, but even half-assing it the Chevy Bolt got better reviews.

POST_TEXT: b'>\tWedbush analyst Daniel Ives raised the price target on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) to $560.00 (from $500.00) while maintaining a Neutral rating. The analyst also raised his Bull Case to $1000 from $800 to reflect this steeper demand EV adoption curve over the next 18 to 24 months for Tesla with China and Europe the linchpins of growth.\n\n>\t"With the sustained path to profitability and S&P 500 index inclusion achieved, the Tesla bull story is now all about a stepped up EV demand trajectory into 2021," Ives commented. "Overall we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025. We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales with 150k+ deliveries in its first year out of the gates with G'

Now that it's been another year, here are the results using the closing price Friday 1-8-21 and the closing price Tuesday (intended to make this post Wednesday but forgot).\n\n*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (% change uses full price).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:03:48'] This would be a fun annual exercise for multiple investing subreddits/communities.For example in a Canadian investing sub you'd see a "Reddit Canada ETF" with Canadian banks, railways, Enbridge, some energy companies, and some of the most known US stocks like the megacaps.  You'd see some things drop out of favour at exactly the wrong time (while they are down in price) like those energy stocks.Bogleheads would probably be pretty constant, though you might see things like small cap value ETFs go into and out of favour.Dividends this year would be SCHD, JEPI, O, and some other individual stocks.  JEPI will probably get replaced by whatever the next hot, high yield ETF comes along just like the xYLDs have fallen out of favour.

I know we're all mostly here for sexier picks, and believe me I have that gambling streak too and own lots of CRM, META, AMZN, and yes even some Gee Emm Eee.

Then everyone is saying ''X'' stock is the best without really knowing why.   So you end up with a trash ''reddit ETF'' that is mostly all hyped stocks that people are just copy/pasting on every thread.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:26:01'] TSLA up over 20% in just the last two days. Normally it wouldn't be worth mentioning but -30 vs -50 is a big difference.EDIT: My math is off but the point remains. A 10% difference in ~2 days is still significant. Really don't understand the downvotes.

She has a Schwab UGMA account and gets $50/mo and has been picking a stock a month since she turned 4 (20 months ago). Her picks are just random brands she knows of (Apple, Disney, Nike, Starbucks, Coke, Tyson, Dominos, Netflix, Google, Marriott, Target, McDonalds, etc) and usually driven by questions like, can I buy cheese pizza or dinosaur chicken stock? And can I buy YouTube stock? Or mom shops at Target and I like the vanilla milkshake at Starbucks.\n\nIm seriously considering just copying her buys each month. Id be better off.\n\nEdit: many were asking for a list of her holdings. Here you go.\n\nATVI, GOOG, AMZN, AAPL, DPZ, MAR, MCD, MSFT, NFLX, NKE, NVDA, PTON, PG, SBUX, TGT, TSLA, KO, TSN, DIS\n\nSome above shes bought multiple months. DIS is her largest position, followed by SBUX, NFLX, and GOOG. Some are smaller because she bought a few each months with the Schwab'

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 13:21:06'] I wouldn't be blindly following a 4 yr old into stocks, but there an edge in paying attention to what kids really like.Peter Lynch used to talk about this. Watching his daughters and wife shop in the mall, asking people about the car they owned, paying attention to the quality and service when staying at a hotel, etc.That kind of feedback is immediate, real, timely and firsthand. Very valuable.If you're buying into a pizza business, question #1 ought to be: *Is the pizza any good?*

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 14:07:06'] LOL I feel your pain. My dad is a retired broker. I got into the market as a teen because tech bubble. I remember asking him about this coffee company had stock because mom went there a lot. Starbucks was relatively new. Bought in finally like 12 years later spring of 2008. Watched it tank to $3. Bought when I could. Eventually sold at 500% gain for Tesla only to crash again. Turned 75k into a million in didn't have a broker -Asked Morgan Stanley guy about taking some profits. Was thinking about selling my options. He didnt like my prefered pick. I held the options. They went to zero. Lost 2/3. Lost the rest trying to get it back

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 12:09:44'] It sounds like your 5 year old daughter has been crushing it in the stock market, with a portfolio that's down only 14% this year despite the S&P 500 being down 18.11%. I mean, seriously, how many 5 year olds can say they've outperformed the S&P 500? Not many, that's for sure. In fact, I'm thinking of just copying her investment strategy. I mean, who wouldn't want to follow the lead of a kid who's making investment picks based on her love of cheese pizza and vanilla milkshakes?    Of course, it's worth keeping in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results, and that no one ‚Äì not even a 5 year old ‚Äì has a crystal ball when it comes to the stock market. But hey, if your daughter's portfolio continues to beat the S&P 500, I might just have to start taking investment advice from her too.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-01 14:02:15'] smart: so she is ignoring all smallcaps and most midcaps and going for half staples and with companies with strong balance sheet and strong fcf+she is well diversified with +10 stocks, 15-20 is the sweet spot.ill say that approach is better than going with the sp500, i would re ask every Q if she still likes every company or if she would like to add more but by dropping the one she likes less.\+make her a pie chart with all picked companies so she can drop one to add one more if she wants. Which is better than just adding all the ones she likes and ending up with +50 companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 02:48:10'] It's tough if your investment strategy only involves stocks and only from a long perspective.  You might want to try doing some spread trades.  Short one company and buy another in the same sector.  Like short McDonald's and long Wendy's (obviously have to do math to make the positions equal). With your daughters diversity, it's great she is learning and would agree to continue this road, but for you, you might as well buy the index.

Everyone likes vanilla milkshakes and cheese pizza.  The key here, I believe, to isolating the kids success is in identifying different exposures or mindsets between you vs kid.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 05:37:22'] I wanna do this with my child but not sure if I want them to be able to take over at 18. I want them to understand investing though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 07:36:02'] So uh, what‚Äôs she buying next?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 07:43:47'] children generally do better stock picking since the brands they're interested in typically are main-stream things all kids at that age like. since kids like it parents buy it and the companies do well. older people have developed their own tastes and also are typically "out-of-touch". also, if kids jump on something it normally does well. if they complain enough their parents will buy and if the parents have deep enough pockets they might sink in a lot of money to keep their kids happy. so, yeah, I would trust a kid to know what's hip and what to invest in
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:09:54'] Yeah... if you like the product other people might too. Good product is foundational to a solid profitable company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 08:30:25'] Wow OP this is a great idea for young kids. Absolutely love this. I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt quite fully understand what they are doing but it‚Äôs a great way for them to learn and invest at the same time. Not for nothing but I bet you here portfolio does well for a long time. She‚Äôs clearly picking the biggest and smartest companies out there! When I have kids I plan on copying this method
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 09:53:28'] Do you lead her to say a specific brand? Using your examples as my examples: "Can I buy YouTube stock?". Do you just go like "uuh sure" and buy GOOG, or do you kinda explain how it works to her? For cheese pizza, do you tell her she can't invest only in cheese pizza, and do you just buy the pizza stock you like the most?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-02 10:41:52'] Not bad at all. I‚Äôd teach her about dividends for growth and since you got her started early she‚Äôs gonna be well off by the time she hits adulthood if that snowball begins

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 21:29:37'] No.  It should be 50% minimum.  I‚Äôm at 63%
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 21:19:49'] I think Tesla will continue to give great entry or re-entry prices. It will always have ppl trying to say it‚Äôs overvalued and some negative media which drives the price usually quickly down as well as enough support and usually enough good media to climb back and possibly eclipse what it was.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 22:45:04'] No idea who BK is but is she/he/it invested in Tesla like Cathy Woods who also says the stock will be this high too?

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-27 07:51:01'] I'm up like 770% right now, I feel like I should skim some off. I already sold some when it 900 awhile back.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 23:03:27'] Tesla isn't overvalued, it's just very optimistically valued. If a number of things go well, it could very well 10X in value over the next decade.The risk really is that historically TSLA drops hard, stagnates and such so your return over a given time period can very a lot. Hence I use stock + theta positive strategies to help ensure that even if it isn't moving much it still does generally well. This works because IV is high since people think it could go up 4X it's current value or more while others think it could go down 4X it's current value or more. While IV isn't so high that it's far in meme stock territory.My recommendation? Keep it at 2.9% and allow it to go up to 10% of your portfolio before you start selling (IE: The "Cathie Woods" way). Also DCA into it to increase it over time (IE increase it by 0.1% or something each month).Do it well and TSLA should treat you kindly even if you hold for a decade and it ends up at $1000 a share in the end.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-25 23:17:12'] I started at like 10% and now its grown to 63%
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 01:44:54'] I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with a single stock making up 5% of my portfolio.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-26 06:08:00'] What's your timeline on the stock?  If you're looking to realize gains within 1-2 years then that's risky. If you're looking to be in this for the long haul (5-10 years) then it's probably a good investment (and at 5% of your portfolio you're not living that much on the edge).As for CNBC: Whatever they say - do the opposite. Seriously. They have a horrible track record when it comes to all things Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-04 19:25:53'] I don't think what you did is wrong, but I think it's worth doing the math on what you're saying you expect their 10-15 year valuation to be. From the peak today hitting 1T in 10 years is an annualized 20% return. In 15 it is a 12% annualized return. Both of those are pretty good, but I think it's worth adding context when you're planning on holding for X price target in Y years vs sticking it in a different stuff.I think your play is at least smart; taking some profit, but keeping some exposure because at this point why not?

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-05 04:52:11'] I like the company, but locking in profits during this speculation/FOMO bubble is wise.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-05 04:56:58'] Bought on 1/22 somewhere around 580, sold at 915. Was happy with 57%.I think there is a lot of FOMO keeping the stock up right now, but it will definitely settle back down in the next few weeks. I think TSLA WILL become a 1k+ stock in the next year or so, but this current run won't bring us to that level of support.Going to reinvest as things settle back down. Great company :)

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-05 06:29:29'] I did the same thing with CRON. My initial investment was 20 shares @ $6 / share. Sold off half at its highest value of something like $18 / share. I realize its not as much as your Tesla stocks, but the approach is the same. When you see an equity as volatile as TSLA or CRON become so overbought and have the opportunity to cover your initial investment, its good take some money back even if you're long. Nicely played.

Could be completely wrong, but imo there‚Äôs no way this price can be sustained for long.A huge volume of shares bought in expectation of selling to the index trackers - problem is, those shares need to be sold to those very index trackers in order to make a return. The question will be, how many will be sold, and how quickly...Could be easily a 10%-20% drop following inclusion.

No one knows how much it will drop. Some think $20, some thing 20%. It's a crapshoot. In 10 years I believe Tesla will be worth a great deal more than $617. Do with that as you will

TSLA isn't going to 'destroy' F, GM, Volks, etc.  They're not 'f*cked'In 5 years all the major players are still going to be around and have EV share.  It'd be a pretty frigging boring world if everyone drove a TSLA.And all the major players are beginning roll outs of cars that are getting a lot of attention - so as you mention F... the Lightning for example.  Which by the way the F150 alone has more market share that all of TSLA's vehicles combined.TSLA for absolute sure has an advantage with FSD right now - but that's almost a non factor for years to come.  Give the people a great looking EV with driver assist & a great info-tainment system that is 'cheap' and people will be lining up to throw money at it.  Makes zero difference what badge it has.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-24 18:52:37'] This is interesting, I was just thinking about something related to this recently. Basically about the nature of structures across time in changing environments; they have to update to keep up, but also conserve most of what works. After long enough, the whole thing will be very complex, and there are going to be systems in place that are costly and outdated.The barrier to entry for a new player boldly entering a massive and complicated market is precisely that they lack this type of infrastructure, and therefore resources and knowledge etc. However if they make it far enough there becomes a tipping point where that lack of infrastructure becomes a massive advantage. You can scale up operations in a way that makes sense in the modern environment. Basically the old dog new tricks problem.In my opinion, Tesla is passing that tipping point. Their manufacturing is incredible. There will be a day in the not so distant future that other automakers won't be able to manufacture the number of vehicles tesla can, and certainly not as cheaply.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 21:16:47'] Hypothetically I see a narrow path. He aggressively cuts costs, fixes bot spam, adds some functionality, diversifies revenue, hires a boring CEO in a few months, advertisers resume. It's at least sustainable at that point and he makes a profit if rates ever go back to zero. Elon bought at $54 in Twitter's historical $15-71 range. Expensive but he also bought with inflated TLSA proceeds so it's largely a wash. You could argue he bought Twitter at 2014 prices with +3000% Tesla shares.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 23:09:05'] I can't wait till the markets recover somewhat. This downturn is brining out the worst of the armchair experts, explaining how the world richest man and only person in the world to have (helped) start 6 different billion dollar+ companies is an idiot and they would've known better.

It‚Äôs turning out these billionaires are about as clever as someone that opens up a franchise or a local business and ‚Äúmake it‚Äù, the difference is just being lucky that‚Äôs on tech and the power of internet distribution gave them billions.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 04:30:09'] He‚Äôs screwing over Twitter employees, firing half of them then asking the remaining half to work as close to 24/7 as possible. You think Tesla employees don‚Äôt see this??  That‚Äôs on top of asking senior Tesla ex-employees to give back stock options. Musk is used to treating people like crap and getting away with it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 06:44:18'] I hope for Tesla's sake that he exits Twitter asap. Hand it over to the creditors and call it a day. What's twitter worth today? $15b?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 07:03:29'] Oh how noble!  Yea, no. Don‚Äôt care, that‚Äôs the price of doing business and him self congratulating is just high level narcissistic gaslighting. Like Tesla stock , he is also over rated.

POST_TEXT: b'Fed is speaking next week\nMany big cap tech results coming out next week\nAnd here we are at a week that ended with animal spirits rally.  \n\nOne has to wonder if this rally is a try really or a massive fake out and trapping liquidity for a lot of bulls.  \n\nLot of times the bottom feels like this.  You dont believe it and everyone thinks its gonna come back and retest.  Now way this could be the bottom.  While others are feeling the FOMO of missing the bottom.   There is always that split. \n\nBut this just feels overdone.  Big mega companies like Nvidia and TSLA have run 80% in a matter of weeks.  \n\nSo where do you stand ?  \n\nDo you think a massive drop is coming by end of March or you are in the camp that its mostly going to up or sideways for next few months and fed is going to be pausing if not cutting and lot of bad news will trickle and that would mean that the economy feels bad but the stocks market will feel good about that as all bad news will be out.   \n\nWhat are the stocks yo'
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 11:53:01'] I'm in disbelief that this would be the start of a bull run, but I'm also horrible at timing the market. So like always. I have no idea.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 20:04:56'] All I know is I probably won‚Äôt make money whatever the market does
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 14:56:40'] I‚Äôll be hoarding cash by Wednesday.  That‚Äôs when J Powell speaks next, and I‚Äôm not so sure it‚Äôll only be a .25 hike, nor do I think it matters.  Don‚Äôt fight the Fed.  Don‚Äôt get mixed up in anything both big and new.  And then within a week, I‚Äôm likely back in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:06:14'] Not saying history predicts the future but the last time the fed raised interest rates and TSLA had a strong run it went south quick. Looking back at the 13-16 in December ‚Äò22.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 19:43:09'] It makes absolutely no sense that this would be a bull run, so it probably is.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 11:31:31'] 3 options... Up, down or sidways.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:59:46'] The only thing I know is that I put around   $3k every two weeks into the market until I max out the contribution limit ($66k for this year) for my 401k/Roth accounts.  I am also holding cash in case the market turns south significantly.  With a 3.5% interest rate,   holding cash is not too bad.  I bought a ton of Amazon, AMD, DIS during the drop and together they went up around $100k worth so far.  I sold some Amazon $111 next Friday calls (8 contracts) for around 1.2k yesterday.  I also sold 5 DIS $110 next week calls (very much ATM calls) because I think I‚Äôll get some opportunities to buy back the shares bellow that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 14:35:04'] The market will do fine until consumer credit and car loan delinquencies go bad and credit deteriorates.  The tech run up now is a great way to make a quick buck but reality will set in, but timing is really questionable.  In retrospect I was too bearish because I like good values.  It is hard trading stocks when you like value but it goes up so slowly.  That said, I haven‚Äôt lost  money, just haven‚Äôt made much.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:14:05'] The FED's higher for longer narrative has failed to tighten financial conditions as we are back at the beginningof this tightening cycle at 6% inflation. They will need to do something more than sound scary now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 23:30:16'] I dont think we can expect massive rally. But if fed does +50 we can see blood. Also if you look at many indicators, we are really overvalued. Doesnt mean anything, just hints. And also, historically biggest drops comes around first fed decrease i believe ? Still long way to go, since we have  atleast two 25 ups comming.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 09:26:01'] I think the question to ask is‚Ä¶ What negative thing could happen that people are not already suggesting/predicting/expecting/guaranteeing will happen? I don‚Äôt know of anything of significance that falls outside of those categories, which leads me to believe the market will continue to move up for two reasons, it‚Äôs the markets natural state to move up over time, most people believe the market is going to go down because the economy has/is/will fall apart. I don‚Äôt believe this is the 1980, early 2000 or 08. I think it‚Äôs more 2014 or 2018. There are things going on but despite interest rates and a weaker economy I don‚Äôt see an alternative to equities.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 16:30:24'] We are due for a pullback but this bull market may run longer than expected since so many are predicting that we are due for that correction/pullback.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 05:06:06'] I think the market will go down, the macro is very bad. Fed still hiking into weakness. Stock market is up because of retail investors piling in because of FOMO. Bitcoin and very speculative stocks are up, it seems to be an irrational thing.Feels like September before the October lows when people were saying the bottom is in because of a technical retracement that called every bottom in the last 50 years. Just like then, I was doubting myself h but it glad I held on to my puts to ultimately profit at the October lows.Having said that, I am anxious and worried.Nobody knows anything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 11:37:36'] Next few weeks, no idea. But the tech bubble has a lot more deflation ahead. Makes little sense that so many unprofitable businesses are valued in the billions, and I expect more layoffs and bankruptcies as funding dries up. You also have large cap stocks like Tesla and Nvidia which are obvious bubbles. Not sustainable, and looks like a classic bear market rally.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:02:16'] Lots of worthless reactions about interest rates hike. Everything has been priced in so far.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 13:19:07'] Lots of times the bottom feels like this? No lots of times the bottom feels horrible, with consecutive weeks of gapping down. something like mid June, but going on for 2-3 weeks. You think the bottom is going to magically be at a technical point of 50% retracement that everyone anticipated that we'd bounce off of, right at a month where all strategists expected we'd rally off of towards the end of the year? Yes at the end September, when sp500 was around 3600, all the strategists made their sp500 year end target revision, and instead of putting something like 3600 or lower, they all put around 4000
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 16:52:44'] Fed looks at core inflation, December core CPI and PCE inflation ticked up from November. So we're heading into a FOMC meeting where the two latest reports in front of them tells them that inflation is still ticking up. Service inflation still 6% at an annualized rate. Institutions aren't buying into this rally, they're still buying into oil stocks. So I'm skeptical.

You expect them to drop more? Inflation is already being curbed according to research with the higher rates, there should be minimal if any more rate hikes. I don‚Äôt think these stocks are going to drop.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 15:06:11'] I went back and looked at every attempted golden cross during correction phases and I found an interesting bit of info. In major corrections there is a fake golden cross before capitulation takes place. These major corrections need the extra optimism before throwing the knock out blow. In contrast tho for minor corrections the golden cross passes and is soon retested with a lower low before restarting the new bull trend. Opposite of the major corrections there needs to be that bear bait to help kick start the bull trend. So what does this mean for me as to what to expect in the coming days/weeks/months? In early January I went from 95% cash to about %30 cash, loading up on shares for many names. All of those names are currently big green. I‚Äôve hedged those shares with a mixture of long dated SPX/IWM spreads and some protective collars on the shares themselves. My goal here is to be positioned for long term moves but with an exit strategy that leaves me green. In sacrificing some of my gains I can ‚Äústay in the game‚Äù in case I did in fact catch the bottom of all of these names.The only name that is a big question mark for my  new positions is LCID. I bought LCID at 6.75 a share and there was some kind of meme pump Friday. Had to roll my covered calls out and my puts up but since I wanted these shares long term I‚Äôm not sure what to do here. I know how to navigate most situations now but never had this issue before. What are you supposed to do if your long term shares get meme pumped? It moved too far too fast. A happy problem to have but still a problem.

Back to stocks, I‚Äôm probably way too tech heavy and currently have recurring buys on SCHD and JEPI, $50 per trading day for each. I cant technically afford this making around 70k, but have the extra cash laying around from my townhouse sale. I have 80k sitting in Robinhood gold earning 4% which pays about $250 per month.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-20 05:31:19'] With all due respect, this type of post makes me want to go buy Tesla stock. You‚Äôre right they don‚Äôt get the same amount of sales as traditional car makers. But they offer arguably the best EVs on the market. Their fans aren‚Äôt delusional. It‚Äôs marketing. Same reason iPhone sales never slowed down despite Android users having all the ‚Äútop features‚Äù before them. The issue is here is Tesla has the marketing of Apple, and the ‚Äúcost‚Äù of the android. What do you mean by ‚Äúno actual data‚Äù? Are they supposed to release statistical results of products years before they release them? Autopilot is getting sued and rightfully so. There have been accidents and deaths. But there is a difference between their autopilot and self driving packages. And the thing is, no other car maker has an auto pilot software package that comes close to Tesla. Yes there are assisted driving packages, but Tesla also has over 5 years of data for their autopilot and self driving features. That data is the most valuable thing for them, as it will keep their software years ahead of the competition. Would I personally use autopilot? No. But is Tesla the world lead in automated driving? Yes. Honestly, you need to define what ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù means. Are traditional car makers going to catch up in EV sales? Yes. Most carmakers have begun the process of transitioning fully electric. And have bigger portfolios. Will traditional car makers portfolios stop or slow Tesla sales? I‚Äôve come to the belief that they won‚Äôt dent Teslas sales at all. Most traditional car makers are going to be fully electric between 2025-2035. Tesla has another 2 years of sales ahead before competitors get close, and 2 years to accomplish one of their many aggressive goals. I agree Tesla is overvalued by traditional metrics. But how do you value a company that forced an industry to change all of their products, is the leader in autonomous driving, and is cutting costs aggressively. I don‚Äôt know how and I stopped trying to figure out how.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-20 07:33:52'] Yup. In this thread: the sentiment keeping the stock afloat.  You will constantly be told how amazing the company is, and they are pushing the rest of the car industry to go into EV, which I agree, is great, but nobody can really explain why the price is $850, and not $600. At $600, that would still make it the most valuable car company in the world, while delivering 1/5 of the cars.  I really like what the company is doing, but it's a very expensive stock. I've worked as an engineer in automotive, and I can tell you scaling is hard. People think the more cars you make, the cheaper everything gets (economies of scale) but it also gives your suppliers more leverage to negotiate prices each year. Tesla is looked at both as a growth company that can grow 50% year over year for 10 years (going from 500k to 1M cars is easier than 1M to 2M) and simultaneously as this behemoth that will make 20 million cars while under-cutting on price, while some how maintaining great margins (I know, they want to sell the car for $30k, and self driving for $10k subscription). Scaling is somehow considered to be easy because of their giga factories and "they are a tech company", but Elon musk was on TV asking for nickel for batteries. Meanwhile, every car company is rushing into EV. I guess tesla margins are immune to supply chain constraints and competition. This is where those supplier negotiations squeeze margins. On top of all this, they haven't run into their first major recall yet.  It will happen, and without a dealer network, and long lead times on repairs now, it's anybody's guess on how they will go about doing it. They also haven't faced a unionized work force or labor strike. People are also acting like the first self driving car company will be the only one, but given the rapid pace of deep learning and churn of expertise out of the company (other companies poaching tsla engineers), it's not reasonable to assume that moat is durable.  Maybe a few years advantage, at most. Many point to road data as a big moat, but training models with less data is a very active field of research. Saying that others won't figure this out is betting against the best math minds in the world, and Nvidia, amazon and Google.  They are also acting like tesla demand is infinitely large. They haven't had to deal with inventory yet, but I promise they will eventually miss sales goals and will have unsold vehicles. When that will happen is difficult to say. Tsla bulls brush all this off as "it just won't happen, tesla will win. Just drive one, and you'll know it's different". I had one for a while, but I can still see the business for what it is.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-20 05:50:49'] Tesla is constantly at the forefront of innovation with three hot sectors- EV, Renewables, and Space Flight. Why in the hell would you bet against such a company? Especially when their margins are improving and their revenue is growing.

I suspect the stock will stay there until we hear a smidge of good news, then it's off to the moon. Buying and holding right now is pretty low risk imo due to the support level, upside potential is massive like all other EV stocks.

POST_TEXT: b'Today I test drove the VW ID.4 and left impressed. I may even order one.  I think VW has a winner here that will take market share away from Tesla Model Y.  The VW fit and finish was great.  It drove very well. feels and looks a lot like a ICE car, and the price was great. Even more so when factoring in tax credits. This will be a great bridge vehicle for getting ICE customers into EV. A few cons with the VW was the software, but that is likely to improve with OTA.  VW partnership with battery co QS looks promising.  TSLA may be the iphone of EV, but I see VW being the Samsung.  It will be interesting how tsla responds.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 18:28:51'] Sounds like you read the news lol. Have you test driven a Tesla?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-18 20:46:33'] I own Tesla shares, so you \*could\* claim that I'm biased, BUT my stock purchase/choice was based (among other factors) in my strong preference for Tesla over VW (and other competitors for now). I'm going to stick only to the car related stuff here, not the stock:1. I test drove both. They are both fine. However, VW feels chintzy to me. The reason why no one wanted an electric car for the longest time is that chintziness (edit: and low range). Tesla made people want to buy an electric car, not only for the environment, but also for their own enjoyment and the pride of ownership. I was an owner of a VW (not electric, obviously), and I can't get excited about having another. If I were to be buying Tesla, then yes.2. VW's weakest point has always been the software/the electric. THAT was always the glitchiest, most annoying part of their cars. So I'm a bit concerned with them going full electric when they couldn't even implement a non-glitchy software in their Jetta. In other words, I cannot even compare Tesla's software to VWs. Or I can... and Tesla wins hands down.3. For me, the aesthetics are incomparable. Tesla feels like a spaceship. I admit it's a different price range, but the inside is incredibly comfortable and aesthetically beautiful. And I'm still impressed that they pulled off the falcon wing doors.4. My four year old daughter tested both with me. She doesn't know that we are peasants who can't afford either of these at the moment:), but she told me to "go to your computer and order Tesla right now!"

Porsche gear box is considerably better than Tesla and a truly better high end alternative in the luxury class (vs BMW who needs to catch up).The paradigm shift is coming to smart motors in wheel wells that eliminate gear boxes, frictional losses and other efficiency killers. This will lower costs by 30%+ and extend range. This is only 3-5 years away and will be talked about en masse in 2022 and will destroy Tesla market share and pricing power in 2024.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-07 14:30:50'] For me, Tesla is not so much a stock, but an asset/store of wealth. The value of a share is not tied to any traditional business or financial calculation. Similar to, let's say gold, Tesla's value is derived from people wanting to own it and it's perceived value. The current economic climate leaves few places to store and increase wealth, so people are flocking to Tesla as a future-proof investment. The financials of the company may never match the stock price but the investors don't care. Gold is just a chunk of metal but people are paying $2k per ounce because its a "safe" store of wealth.Tesla will fall when a "better" or "shinier" store of wealth comes around.

I'm coming here to hear the pro  nio  guys to tell me im  wrong about something.I was looking at their financial statements and their cost of sales are going up at a faster rate than their revenue.And they have a current liabilities of about 10b.  And current assets of only 4b...where are they going to get the assets to pay?They have a negative free cash flow of about 10b.Basically I want to believe in them cuz I agree with everything op  said.  But their financial statements are scaring the hell out of me to get in
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 10:20:40'] I have my own points that make me bullish on NIO:1) Their battery swapping mechanism is the way to go in China. Vast majority of Chinese people live in high rises, so there are benefits there vs installing EV chargers in every parking spot. Although eventually, on a long term horizon every new building will have chargers, or at least a heavy percentage of parking spots will have them.2) The car are reliable, at least according to this  [https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nio-leads-ev-quality-jd-power-finds-china](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nio-leads-ev-quality-jd-power-finds-china) 3) The SUVs support the dynamics of a family + kids + one set of parents fitting into the car when going on a visit/to the mall/etc...4) Money isn't a pressing problem anylonger as it was just a few months ago5) NIO houses are an exclusivity technique, which usually turned out well if the product/service is solid.As for potential problems:There is competition from other Chinese EV brands. Tesla as well of course, Tesla's brand and reputation eclipses anything else in the EV world. The cars are expensive. I doubt vast majority of NIO SUVs are purchased by single families that can easily afford them. More likely it is a family + help from extended family to buy the car, with expectation that it will be used for the benefit of all. The costs will have to trend down over time.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-16 03:49:43'] I think NIO cars with battery change technology is the way forward for a lot of countries and people, where I live it would be the only way to have an EV because you can't plug in anywhere

Owners can park anywhere. Traffic cops often can not do anything.There are many other local eV manufacturers. LI for example wants to list stocks in the US. Furthermore there are many Japanese designed cars in China some have operation in China for years. Have not heard much from them for China. The medium priced eV will be very competive.

POST_TEXT: b"The Chinese are known for ignoring international copyrights on intellectual property and making knockoff products, in same cases nearly identical to the original but sold at cut throat prices.  Why would Tesla not be concerned about that so much so that they'd build a factory over there? (sorry for poor wording it's 4:30am)\n\nEdit: Rather than physical manufacturing of the whole vehicle, I was more thinking about them having access to new battery production techniques (like the Dry process Electrode Fabrication from the Maxwell acquisition), electrical systems, vehicle operation software, AI and related technology."
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 02:53:59'] Oh im sure they will.Elon knows this
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 06:12:29'] Elon has made all of his patents available for anyone that wants them. I'm guessing the money he saves by building in China beats the money he loses from them ripping off his already available IP.Anyone that thinks this is too complicated for China to do is dreaming. Capitalism, and the world's best engineers can create amazing things, China has essentially a billion well educated slaves and they dont have to invent anything. They just have to copy.I would imagine that Elon made a deal with China on access to insanely cheap raw materials as well, and part of that deal is that the government could steal their IP, but not steal any branding or design language.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 06:18:57'] I think it is pretty clear from his speeches that Elon's goal with Tesla is not making the best car company that he can, but rather using car manufacturing as a way to finance research and development of technologies that he thinks are important to the world. Tesla has already made big strides in battery technology, self-dricing cars, and electric vehicles. So it probably doesn't matter too much if China steals Tesla IP. Obviously Tesla will prefer to profit off of the technology breakthroughs themselves but this is  technology that Tesla wants to be spread worldwide anyway. I don't know is Tesla's management actually cares as that much about profitability. But if you are worried China will outcompete Tesla, no need. Buying a Tesla is a status symbol, just like how Rolex watches can be replicated for cheaper, people will still buy the actual luxury item because a knockoff doesn't provide the same status symbol.

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 07:22:00'] Elon has stated that his goal with Tesla is to accelerate the adoption of electric cars so I doubt he would have any issues with this.

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 02:14:51'] The Chinese need to be able to implement things, they can‚Äôt just steal a piece of blue paper out of the office file cabinet after hours and run away in their trench coats.

No company goes into China and expects to be dealt with fairly, they go into China knowing that the IP theft won‚Äôt affect them because they make new better stuff faster than Wish.com vendors can make imitations, and the quality, availability and inexpensiveness of labor makes up for any possible losses.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 08:24:53'] Nothing. Nothing at all. Just like the nuclear industry where they took Westinghouses design..they will take this as well.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 08:21:10'] Tesla has a history of not patenting their inventions and designs, and forfeiting  their existing patents into the public domain because they want to show that expanding the electric vehicles market in the name of environmentalism is more important than corporate profits. There already are several Chinese brands making electric vehicles, but a lot of western car companies have also moved into electric vehicles. Tesla is making a bet that their manufacturing processes, procurement chain and brand reputation are strong enough to keep the brand profitable even without strict IP protection
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 08:19:02'] China can copy most things, but hi-tech stuffs that require safety standards are harder to copy and validate. This is the same reason why commercial airplane engines (boeing, airbus) remains a duopoly in the world.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 08:20:09'] Because they probably will regardless of if they're made in China or not and Elon would just like to cut out the middle man and sell directly. Also, higher-end Chinese consumers, i.e. the ones that can afford a Tesla are very concerned with quality and won't buy lower quality products.Also, Apple still sells a shit ton of iPhones in China despite knockoffs.

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 05:02:30'] Because building a car is more complicated than copy and paste. For it to be stolen, not only would they have to steal the tech but the production methods AND make it cheaper than import.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 11:19:30'] Actually China holds a lot of rare earth minerals. By placing a factory in China, Tesla probably made a deal to smoothen access to those minerals used in batteries and electronic circuits.  Tesla is planning to develop it‚Äôs own batteries. Also, even tough Chinese love to copy, Tesla can surely benefit from the mindset of the middle and high class who remains deeply attached to western brands. You can take for example the rise of LVMH in Asia, HSBC, german cars, even Ikea (a great portion of it‚Äôs products are produced in China but Chinese prefers to go to Ikea just for the brand).Edit : another funny example is the amount of small Eiffel tower the Chinese will bring back in their own country yet all of it is produced in their country.

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 13:28:10'] Of course China steals IP.  At the time he's opening in China it's because he believes his brand name is strong enough to weather the knockoffs.  There's a premium to an American name in China.

You've also seen companies like [ASML win](https://www.eenewsanalog.com/news/asml-wins-punitive-damages-chinese-ip-theft-case) in Chinese IP theft cases, and Qualcomm years ago started getting paid for their licenses.So the premise that China is some lawless land where IP theft is rampant and without consequence isn't current.On Tesla specifically, one of the reasons Tesla sells well is because it has a great brand. If you took all of its technology and put a different label on it, I don't think it'd sell as well.China's also quite advanced with EVs -- they've got the [biggest EV battery manufacturer in the world](https://qz.com/1585662/how-catl-became-the-worlds-biggest-electric-car-battery-company/) with CATL, along with the [biggest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-04-16/the-world-s-biggest-electric-vehicle-company-looks-nothing-like-tesla) with BYD (though a lot of this is buses).---Edit: Here's a good piece from The Economist in February 2019 on China and IP: [Chinese firms are not all serial intellectual-property thieves](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/02/09/chinese-firms-are-not-all-serial-intellectual-property-thieves)>Yet among Chinese firms, the mindset is starting to change‚Äîas it eventually did among Japanese firms after they robbed America blind in the 1970s and 1980s. From humble beginnings (Mr Hu applied for his first patent in a half-built bungalow), China accounted for 44% of the world‚Äôs patent filings in 2017, submitting twice as many applications as America, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Companies, mostly Chinese ones, sue each other over patents in China more than in any other country.>When foreigners do litigate in China, Rouse, a law firm, says they have a higher win rate in patent cases than domestic ones, and are awarded more damages overall. Such fines are low by international standards, but are improving: Alfred Dunhill, a British luxury brand, won a $1.4m payout in October over trademark infringement by a Chinese menswear brand called Danhuoli. In January, the ip court system was bolstered by the establishment of an appeals tribunal at the Supreme People‚Äôs Court in Beijing.>The more inventive it is, the more protection benefits China. Huawei was the world‚Äôs biggest filer of international patents in 2017; whatever misgivings there are about its loyalties to the Chinese state, it is hard to doubt its commitment to innovation. An executive at Alibaba notes that as Chinese firms expand globally, particularly in South-East Asia, they, too, suffer from having their ideas ripped off, making them keener to protect them. As China‚Äôs economy weakens, says an executive of Beiqi Foton Motor, a vehicle manufacturer, his firm will need to protect its patents from rivals even more, to guard its share of a shrinking market.>Executives admit to gaping holes in the ip system, particularly in inland regions where local tribunals are subject to heavy-handed interference by provincial governments keen to shield local copycats. That is why some ip executives in China accept the rationale behind American arm-twisting. After all, they admit, if it were not for American pressure on intellectual property, China would not have come half as far. That is not to say they approve of Mr Trump‚Äôs bombastic approach, which adds to the sense that America is trying to stifle China‚Äôs rise. But the desire for change is both internally and externally driven. As one executive puts it, ‚ÄúNo one likes to be called a thief‚Äînot even kids.‚Äù

	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 14:32:41'] They are probably already doing it, they do it with everything,  that's why they have almost the biggest economy.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 04:44:48'] You can't just copy a car. It takes a lot of knowledge you can't just copy and a large investment in factories to build them. Even then you may not be able to turn a profit. IP law in China does exist and it would be very easy for authorities to target and shut down a rogue car factory.
	COMMENT: ['2019-12-02 07:17:07'] What IP?I'm sure China has more than enough 90s Volvo to rip off a boxy design...so they don't need to penetrate the factory to steal the Cyphertruck....plus I don't know if they could make it out the factory without breaking it!

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 05:54:57'] We've had an obscene amount of posts about TSLA lately and they all devolve into harassment and trolling regarding musk.  This one is no different so we're locking it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:49:42'] If you like tsla at this level you‚Äôll probably like it more at $50-$70 range
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 10:18:57'] I wrote this 1 year ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/hip0kt7/market cap was $1.1 trillionI wrote this 2 months ago:https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/it3xpyf/?context=3market cap was $644 billionToday market cap is: $385 billionThe reasons you mentioned are valid; but you left out China demand issues. I mentioned in both of my post above.   I believe China demand has somewhat plateaued. they will sell in record numbers in china in q4; but there are some headwinds:  the subsidy is gone in 2023.  more competition: notably the byd seal: they started selling in september 2022 and in november 2022: it sold 15K. Tesla sells about 10k (edit: model 3 per month.  So there is Model Y: but the byd sea lion is coming (on top of the current competition in the Zeekr 001, BYD Yuan Plus).  I think the sea lion will put a lot of pressure on the Model Y.  Then you add subsidies on EV ends in China in 2023.  So can Tesla still grow in China? Yes, but they will have to either cut prices or come out with a lower price model: both of these will affect margins. Europe:  This market will continue to grow but there are some cracks. at the end of Q4: Tesla offered some discount on their inventories  (https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-discounts-up-to-e4000-on-model-3-y-purchases-from-existing-inventory-in-europe/).  Subsidies in major markets in Europe is winding down also. UK winded down: https://www.electrive.com/2022/06/14/the-british-government-has-stopped-subsidizing-electric-cars/.  UK market is important to watch because of this.  Germany is also winding down:  by 2024 vehicles above ‚Ç¨45Ksource: https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-coalition-parties-agree-reduce-e-car-subsidies-handelsblatt-2022-07-26/I don't know about France.  ,3 most populous country in the EU are Germany, UK, and France.  Then you have more competition: not just from EV but from traditional hybrids: ie prius, civic hybrid, etc. USA:  Tesla was given a carrot here with the IRA (I am still not 100% sure how much if any Tesla buyers will get).  but many won't be able to get this due to income limits.  Saying that I think Tesla will grow by quite a bit here.  However if the following link is accurate: (https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/the-inflation-reduction-act-ev-provisions/), the subsidies for NEW EV is only $7.5 billion: it will run out in 2 to 5 years: depending on how much each vehicle qualifies for and how much qualified EV GM, Ford, VW produce.  At the end of the day: Tesla is a premium/luxury cars. the market for these cars is very finite.  Without subsidies, many EV are not cost competitive with hybrids.  Current market cap of $385 billion: this is much more palatable than $1.1 trillion or $644 billion.  But my question is still the same. $385 market cap: at 10% market return: in 7 years: market cap will be $770 billion. And future PE of 25: earnings will have to be about $30.8 billion/year or $7.7 billion/quarter.  Again this is a lot more palatable than what I wrote 2 months ago ($13 billion/quarter).
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:39:42'] Lol at #3. That‚Äôs an Elon excuse. But didn‚Äôt affect anyone else to this level. It‚Äôs almost like the fintech guy has never dealt with rising interest rates before & doesn‚Äôt know how to handle it.And you very much need a #6: Elon‚Äôs right wing rants on Twitter lost him a *LOT* of customers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:32:54'] It's funny how you "miss" the most obvious oneElno needs to finance his Twitter disaster. There won't be a stop to the selling until a) Twitter somehow becomes profitable, b) Elno somehow gets more funding at no risk to his Tesla shares, c) the creditors execute the debt and seize colateral and Twitter or d) Elno goes.bankruptA and B are never ever happening , so...

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:49:39'] I think that Telsa shares are falling because the shine is wearing off Elon and people are seeing how unhinged he actually is. I wouldn't want him withing 3 miles of any company I own.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 15:39:08'] You failed to even mention 2 important factors:1) The head start Tesla had in this space (mass produced EVs) has evaporated.  The other major players are now all-in on making competitive EVs.  They are just a couple years from taking huge chunks of market share from Tesla.2) Elon went full right wing conspiratorial nutjob on the political spectrum, which pissed off the main group of people that would have purchased Teslas going forward - upper middle class environmentally conscious liberals.  No right wingers obsessed with hunter biden‚Äôs laptop or paul pelosi‚Äôs gay lover are buying an electric vehicle.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:27:58'] For point 1, I think Elon is clearly unhinged, and is not fit to manage a publicly traded company, Tesla would be better off without him. However, he has lied so much, and built a large stock price increase on top of that, that kicking him out would have to make investors rexamine what the company looks like in the future. Then there are two other big issues. First, increased competition from the big boy car markers, and 2nd, everything to do with FSD. There is going to be lawsuits from customers over false advertising, and all it takes is one confirmed disaster where FSD causes an accident and kills someone. I can see how it works in YouTube videos, and how its advertised, there is a big gap between the two, and I think that's a big legal liability.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 12:06:46'] I love how confident you are about a stock "Devaluing" when everyone and their mother knows that Tesla's value is literally based on hype lmfao
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:44:10'] Imo it‚Äôll be good to probably accumulate in 2023.  However I won‚Äôt expect the same insane rate of growth.  I believe those days are gone.  Just a slow steady grind year to year instead of a 500% increase in 5 years.  The insane rate of growth, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever get that back.  I expect less volatility and for its price to move more like a mature company after it finally hits its bottom.  Still has some room to go down imo within the next 12 months.  The people who bought the top around November 2021, I think it‚Äôll take at least several years to break even on those shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 13:40:10'] Find it amusing how some people (like Musk) think that it‚Äôs no big deal if the CEO stopped showing up to work. If the starting QB stopped showing up to practices and games and called it in, would the team not be negatively impacted? And if said CEO is not needed that badly, WTF is TSLA paying him so much for? Either way the biggest losers are the bag holders.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 13:48:55'] You forgot #6.  Elon showing his true colors and making himself to be another rich, narcissistic asshole.  People are selling because he has besmirched the Tesla brand.  Because Tesla = Elon and Elon = Tesla, any stupid thing he says or does reflects badly on Tesla.In any case, hopefully Elon severs himself from Tesla or Twitter.  He cannot go on being an absolute asshole - the very thing he accused Twitter and its former executives of doing, he is doing himself (re-learning what Twitter had learned) - going through the growing pains that Twitter has gone through already is stupid.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:14:43'] It‚Äôs falling because Tesla is not and never was (and never will be) worth 4x as much as Toyota. It‚Äôs still grossly overvalued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 10:56:11'] Lmao. You didn‚Äôt include that Elon has gone Nazi and trying to own the very people who buy Teslas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:33:24'] the real math simply catches up.I browse undervalues nearly every day. Real shame. It is like witnessing abuse.tesla sucked in so much of market share..

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 10:29:19'] People say the shine has come off of Elon after Twitter, but Twitter only accelerated the deterioration. The robot presentation was a disaster, the cyber truck isn't coming, the Semi is being panned by critics for obvious flaws in design and execution. Tesla is struggling with the basics of delivery on new products. They no longer are market leaders in design and innovation, there are companies that do every element of what they do better than them. Over the long term this means they aren't as valuable.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 14:32:40'] Amazing how in 2020 this sub was supporting TSLA. If you dared speak ill of EV, Tesla or ARKK/G you were downvoted to the bottom. Now it‚Äôs mainstream. Amazing. I was there, I was a denier and warned people that these are risky and overvalued. Yet people claimed ARKK was less risky than VOO‚Ä¶.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:41:16'] Aside from Elons craziness in general. The product is not getting better.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:13:04'] Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 40, forward P/E  at 23, PEG at .78 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).    It operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).    It does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.    Despite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).    All this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 08:48:02'] Reason #1 is pretty silly. Tesla is currently on FSD mode - and daily input from a CEO is highly regarded opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 09:37:49'] The whole robo taxi valuation is gone, and it‚Äôs just a car company now with lots of competition coming. Musk can‚Äôt handle defeat so everyone accusing him of being distracted with Twitter is giving him the off ramp from Tesla he needs. But I do own a car and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with them. I just had new tires put on at 70k miles and they said the original brakes look fine. He got the ball rolling for the EV‚Äôs and I‚Äôll give him the creditüëç

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:00:54'] I think your point about the rising increase rates being responsible for the drop in stock price is correct because the entire market is down, not just Tesla. I also think if Elon can just give his mouth a rest for a while then Tesla stock price can rebound. Some of Tesla‚Äôs fundamentals haven‚Äôt change that much. EVs are the future of motor vehicles. Tesla is best positioned to exploit that future. And those two factors means that it‚Äôs stock deserves a premium over the legacy car makers.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:34:01'] Reason 3 is hysterical. Fed is at 4.5, aiming for 5.25-5.5 but that‚Äôs not the rate the banks will give. Prime goes on top, so yes. When Elon says 6% right now, that will be 7% soon. He‚Äôs not talking about what he thinks future rates will be. If you‚Äôre still confused, go try to take out a loan right now.He has astronomical debt on a failing / non-revenue generating social media company. Add in the rumour that he‚Äôll get margin called on his debt collateral at these prices and he‚Äôs got even more selling pressure.This is not reflected in the share price yet. There‚Äôs a loooooooot more blood in the water coming. Even if it‚Äôs a tech, solar renewable, or car company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 14:18:22'] I think every single EV company is down over 80% so I think at some point tesla will be down at 80% from the peak.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 14:56:25'] Lol there's no way we're in deflation because the Fed is using lagging indicators or what he calls "legacy methods." That's a fucking moronic statement.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 15:06:16'] It‚Äôs nowhere near $600B. Their moat is shrinking quickly and they just announced spinning down solar.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 15:21:35'] Reason #6 Tesla has never spent much money on marketing, with the main advertisement being Musk himself. With Musk delving heavily into partisan (right-wing) politics, many people who are interested in owning EVs (usually decidedly NOT right-wing folks, who are happy with their gas-guzzling SUVs) are heavily incentivized to look at the fast-expanding EV lineup of Tesla's numerous competitors instead.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 17:35:03'] Not sure why this always seems to happen, but overvalued stocks start to crash back to their reasonable valuation and then proceed even lower because it coincides with a major market correction - so you get a double whammy.If the consumers are tapped out next year, sales will get hurt. Q4 might show some cracks. Q1 may be really bad.BTW, we just got a really nice bounce in the SPY back to 410 and now rolling over to 382. What happens to TSLA when the SPY goes to 320?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 17:42:53'] There is a very simple thing Tesla could do that could help right the ship. Adopt Lidar as a ADAS and future fsd component. Microvision is the best in class when it comes to  lidar and adas. There is no reason he can buy Twitter for a ridiculous amount of money, but be unwilling to spend a few billion to partner with MVIS to save lives.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 01:33:02'] I just was watching car vids and saw one comparing the self-parking of a tesla, audi, bmw and mustang.Teslas self-parking was pretty bad.Tesla took a commanding lead in the sector and has now squandered it. The other auto manufacturers have passed them in some areas and are working hard to close the gap and pass them in the remaining, and they've lost their cachet of being cool thanks to musk running his mouth on twitter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 02:37:59'] You failed to even touch the personal level.  A CEO is the face of a company, when they look bad, confidence is lost.  Elon has absolutely had a breakdown as he has burned twitter to the ground.  Not only does he appear incompetent in that standpoint, but he also drug his company into a political nightmare.  Tesla is not strong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 02:48:56'] I wonder if Twitter was ever consistently profitable? they had a few quarters or maybe a year-but I don't think they had consistent profits year over year-like normal companies?? Plus with so many companies pulling advertisements off their platforms, it is going to be tougher.&#x200B;I am not a billionaire like Elon-but I don't realize the benefit of pissing off your customers-most TSLA owners are the rich left set. Why go after your own customers?? If he is retired and out of TSLA, he can do what he wants, but go after your own "base". Hubris or maybe just  a midlife crisis???

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 04:47:50'] Tesla was way, way overvalued. That is it. It is getting repriced to something that makes sense.Once that is complete then it will be a fantastic long term investment.Where I live Tesla has quickly become the subdivision car. Talking to owners they simply love the brand. I can't tell you how many had one and purchased a second for the spouse.The cars are loved by not only men but also women.BTW, on the self driving front. Tesla has a one of a kind and next to impossible replicate feedback loop with customers. Where they are not only willing but ethusastic to help with the development of self driving with their data.I believe at some point we will see Tesla pivot and use LiDAR. It was never feasible in the past as was just too expensive. But that is not the case as much any longer and it will only continue to plummet in price.So once they add LiDAR and then with the feedback loop they will be in excellent shape. They will take a hit with their customers becaue of all these ridiculous promises of the past. But that will only be a speeed bump and they will get past it, IMHO.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 12:13:52'] Tesla valued at 190/share?? Tesla is way overvalued compared to other EV and regular auto manufacturers. It has no new innovations coming out to improve itself and the products are cheaply made for the price they sell for. It has a lot more room to fall. Also the increase in EV competition will dilute its value over time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 16:20:33'] The biggest factor aside from interest rates is  the realization that FSD is a grift.  Robotaxis would be worth hundreds of billions.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:36:42'] get out of ARKK, Cathy Wood is a charlatan
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:41:59'] Understand that you're double/Triple dipping.$SPY contains all the stocks you've listed. So, you are weighting your portfolio towards tech. This is perfectly fine, as long as you understand it's what you're doing.ARKK is giving you TSLA exposure as well.Your portfolio is pretty correlated. i.e : $SPY goes up, most of the stocks go up. $SPY goes down - most of the stocks go down. Look into some defensive plays as well. Tech has outperformed in the last decade, but does not have to. I'd add a commodity / Precious metal etf to balance things out a bit.On a side note, I wish I had the financial sense to start at your age.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:46:06'] I‚Äôd recommend you liquidate right away - then:Keep 10% for investing in companies. Invest in only your top 3 ideas90% put it all in the Vanguard total market index fund (one holding)Over time contribute every month to both funds. Of monthly contributions: 90% monthly to vanguard and 10% to companies fund. Once you‚Äôve read and gained experience and after you‚Äôve been through 1) a big stock boom2) a huge crash/recession3) a period of extreme low volatilityThen you adjust your 90-10 breakdown, put more in stocks. But always invest in just your top 3 ideas. Why put money in your 4th best idea?Best of luckAlso - keep in mind when you read in the news that we‚Äôre ‚Äúofficially‚Äù (not likely or maybe) but officially in a recession - as in have gone through 2 quarters of negative GDP in the past! Then you double or triple contributions monthly. You make your fortune in recessions. 99% of people won‚Äôt have the mental fortitude and gut strength and foresight (keep cash and your job available) to do that. Be that 1% and do the above and you‚Äôll make a fortune in no time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:44:44'] Good job.  I'd toss ARKK and substitute XSD or one of the other semiconductor ETFs.I'd also suggest having one share of XLK and QQQ to just compare your whole portfolio against.  QQQ could be a stand-in for META/GOOG/TSLA/AMZN/COST and XLK for AAPL/MSFT/NVDA/AMD.  Longterm it is a good idea to have an industry base ETF (like QQQ and XLK for "tech") and then go heavier with individual stocks.  You kinda do that by holding SPY, but it is a pretty small part of your portfolio at this point.Obviously you like tech, and so do I.  Having some diversity beyond tech, like KO, is good but don't worry too much about it until you have at least $xx,xxx in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:02:34'] ARKK is junk, imo. She's selling hype. Otherwise you're basically in big tech, plus KO, COST, and VZ. Why did you choose those?I'd imagine you could just buy QQQ and have similar results with less risk. Or just put it all in SPY, since you are basically buying the biggest parts of SPY. Also, VOO has a much lower expense ratio than SPY for essentially the same thing. You might want to review expense ratios.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:30:43'] Those are obviously fine companies.  The only criticism is that most are all very large cap technology companies.  The future growth may or may not be there.  For example AAPL is not going to increase by 32,000% or whatever again.  Same with AMZN.   It‚Äôs mathematically impossible.I‚Äôm a bit closer to retirement and would no doubt be happy with all of these in my portfolio.  Most are thru a large cap fund.   You may want to consider more in SPY or find some growth ETF‚Äôs.  I see ARKK but just hate Cathie she buys some duds.   Anyways, great job keep it up.  Was just commenting to make a point and give you something to think about.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:39:36'] ET 10% Div yield vs VZ 6.8%. neither price moves much so I'd go with the higher dividend and I like energy lont term +10yrs. If you can catch ET under $12 I like the buy.You seem big on tech, but I'd consider some rock bottom prices on some innovation company's working toward revenue, small positions in companies with good cash runways nearing the revenue stages. I'm a huge MVIS fan. I think they have the best in class product and based on the recent earning call I think the next 6-12 months sees major progress with OEMs and tier 1 clients.Do what's best for you, and don't blindly take advice on here. Do your research and make sure your comfortable with the risk
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:30:55'] At 19, I would suggest you add dividend paying stocks to your portfolio, growth stocks are okay. But with monthly/quarterly dividends, that you can reinvest into more shares, you have more control and can begin building a passive income that will only keep growing over time
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 13:34:43'] My advice.  Get rid of all your stocks.  Just stick to your 80/20 VTI/ VXUS.  Invest each month into whatever is lagging to keep it 80/20 each month FOREVER.  That's it.  Then focus on what is more important to be rich.... Your education, job, income, savings, and LBYM.  Below is a link from JPM own private wealth arm concluding after looking at last 35 years of all individual stock returns they can't even suggest adding a concentrated portfolio to their OWN clients!  https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 12:27:22'] Not very diversified, is it? Not any criticism, but I would more diversify. Have you thought about some ETF's so spread is bigger? I just see a lot of tech and mainstream stocks!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:17:05'] Oh god ARKKOther picks look okay enough, but I‚Äôd do VOO over SPY
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:33:58'] TSLA & ARKK\- TSLY follows TSLA plus it provides monthly div\- OARK tracks ARKK ETF and has monthly div.If TSLA and ARKK turn south you still have div income, if they head north div is more.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:21:08'] It's a lot of holdings. Large caps too. First, throw away ARKK, seriously. Then put whatever you want to keep low-risk in SPY, BRKB, VOO, VXUS or VTI, and try to add some risk to your portfolio. You're 19, find a company you like, understand (maybe in the field you're studying or working in today) and think is promising, then put some money you're willing to lose in it. Sell some covered calls for income if you like.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 18:56:03'] What you are doing is create your own ETF. There is nothing wrong with this strategy as long as you focus on those stocks and don‚Äôt expand them into a hundred, then you end up with a lot of little. Also I see some of your stocks pay dividends. Make sure you reinvest them. Finally, stay away from shady stocks like biopharma, they are very risky. You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term? It does pay great dividends but for the past several years has done nothing so although a stock like that may be good for an older investor looking for a steady dividend paying stock, at 19 it‚Äôs not a good thing, you don‚Äôt need dividends, you need growth. Also if you like a particular sector, get ETFs, and don‚Äôt shy away for an S&P ETF, or small caps, historically they have done well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 01:04:38'] Congratulations to you - I wish I had done this when I was 19!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 09:38:07'] I‚Äôve only invested in 4 stocks in 14 years amd Tsla googl and aapl. Sold one of them 2 years back (amd) and hold and invest in only 3 now. My personal strategy is less diversification the better. Avoid dividend traps bc you‚Äôre young , no need for that. Find the brands you love and invest in them
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 10:39:28'] Consolidate more .... For heavens sake, you are still in ARKK!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 08:19:51'] Are you cool leaving this untouched for at least 10 years, ideally more? If not, you might want to think about an alternative plan, but there are plenty of broad market type ETFs to invest in where you can just set it and forget it. VOO is an S&P 500 fund which represents about 85% of the US stock market and is the most popular index being tracked. That‚Äôs a perfectly fine option. You could also consider VTI which represents the total US Market, but the difference in performance will likely be very small. Most investors think at least some international exposure is a good idea, especially if your time horizon isn‚Äôt very very long. You have a few basic options if you wish to include some broad international exposure. One option is to combine (VOO or VTI) with VXUS which represents the total investable stock market outside the US at some percentage you feel comfortable Witt. VT is a single ETF which represents the total global stock market at the current market cap weights (which is currently around 60/40 U.S./ex-U.S.). These are some basic options. Again, if you feel you might need the money in the next 5 years or even 10, you might want to consider other options than an all stock portfolio. Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 08:34:03'] VOO or SCHD are probably the easiest set and forget investments. Would recommend against the conventional advice from advisors telling you to buy their target retirement mutual fund. They underperform AND charge you high fees.

They are well represented with the other low cost ETFs and the nasdaq ones typically have a higher fee.These 4 are popular because of low fees, or no fees for BKLC. SCHD is slightly different than the rest due to its focus on dividend payout.No one knows which one will outperform. Just pick whatever you want.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-11 08:01:45'] Worldwide production was about 80 mm/year before EVs and will be about the same after EVs.   How that production is divided up is all we are talking about.   I expect Tesla will do well and end up somewhere in the 10 mm car/year range.  That will make it worth about what Toyota or VW is now.   Where Rivian fits in that new world order will have to be determined.So that will place Tesla's market value somewhere between 15% and 25% of their current market cap or stock price.   And that is assuming that Tesla is fabulously successful and grows to the size of VW group or Toyota.

RIVN is the next EV company that will struggle to be profitable, struggle to ramp up production, and struggle to win market share. It‚Äôs just like TSLA.

Their financial backing is Ford and Amazon.  They won‚Äôt be the next Tesla but don‚Äôt think this company is fading away either.  They already have 2022 orders filled (25000).  Their goal is to ramp up production making 200,000-300,000 trucks by 2023.  If they achieve that goal they‚Äôll be profitable by 2024-2025.  That‚Äôs quicker than Tesla.

Their business model right now is based on emissions credits, which they'll continue to reap from for a little while, but with these credits programs, and the  USMCA tariffs changes I think investing in suppliers, technology and resources that support these vehicles is the better way to go.

My input in this is the safeguards that I have in place that help me avoid these mistakes.\n\nAs human beings, we're facing all kinds of risks in our lives. Often times we have certain safeguards in place, whether that is conscious or not.\n\nThink of the time you were taught that before passing on the other side of a street, you need to take a look left and right (or right and left, depending on the country you live in).

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 11:47:07'] It's a good start. Every one of those is true. There are a couple of big ones missing though, the first one is knowing where you're wrong. This could be a price or it could be an activity. This does not apply to indexes but it does to individual securities commodities or other investments. The second one is thinking about where you're going to get out. Both of these go through my head before I ever put on a trade. It took me about 7 years before I became profitable. Realizing where I'm wrong has probably been the single best skill along with not taking advice from people online. You might use what they say to do some research but going in blind? 90% of people who try to trade lose money.

Stock pickers change strategies and start investing in ETF‚Äôs when if they had just held their stocks and continue to DCA during the dip, they would have probably have out-performed the market (provided they pick are high quality companies).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-17 17:13:42'] I also look at book value. For high tech or growth it can be in mutiples.Consider both MSFT and TSLA.  Both have been downgraded.  Both have PE: 25 book value of for Tsla is $12 while MSFT is $23.  Both have strong selll rating (overvaluation) and have a rating of sell (no momentum) .  Ford, Tesla closest competitor, has a P/E of 7,8  and and book value of 10.5 with a SELL rating at 1/10th of Tsla price.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\nTSLA is going to drop more before it rises again. \n\nConsider all the usual problems with growth stocks: extremely high PE and forward PE, speculative future income. After so much QE, there is simply so much space for quantitative tightening coming. Yellen has recently reiterated her commitment to controlling inflation to 2% by the end of 2022. While that is optimistic, I think that this reflects the general sentiment at the Fed that something has to be done before the inflation situation deteriorates further. While some of the recent price drops come from fear, the issue with many of these growth stocks comes from contracting PE in the foreseeable 1-2 years. When rates are higher and money is less available, the big players (and hence also the small players) are simply incentivized to hold more cash. This, in turn, will cause prices to drop, and there is a vicious cycle going on here that is the reverse of the virtuous bubble cycle that brought prices so high in the first place. \n\nA'

It caused him to sell on the first big jump to $640.   He makes a great case for $427 (which is why he sold on its first rocket to $640) but has rewritten his valuation so that you can add up the parts and see what you come up with yourself.\n\nRather than be a crazy bull or bear, give us your thoughts on these projections and where you think they are too optimistic or to pessimistic.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-09 14:00:08'] I think the one thing this model is lacking is an appropriate Operating margin. Q4 19 operating margin was 4.9%. Considering the fact that they just opened up a factory in China, starting to build one in Germany and Texas, I think this will reduce the operating margin in the short term but will shoot up in the futureAlso, cost of capital is really high!!

What's his bear and bull case?Because most people are thinking the story is that in a bear scenario, Tesla is still the best in the business EV company in a field that didn't take off the way we thought it would. Bull scenario is a total collapse of the IC motor industry and Tesla domination in markets others than cars (software, charge infrastructure, grid-level storage).The real *story is much simpler than complicated valuation models.* The story is that a market-defining success story like Apple or Amazon with the best talent and a visonary founder only comes around once every ten years or so, and if you don't identify these companies and get in early enough, the opportunity cost is immense.To these fund managers pouring billions into the company, the opportunity cost risk looms larger than their investment risk at this time. Naysayers call this FOMO, or fear of missing out. But there is actually a legitimate economic name for this, and it drives many economic decisions out there:Opportunity cost.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-12 01:09:08'] Tesla is going to correct at some point. The only thing that carried them this high is momentum/hype/FOMO and that can run quickly in both directions with a company like Tesla. I‚Äôm just not smart enough to figure out when it‚Äôll happen or ballsy enough to short the stock and bet on it. If you‚Äôre bullish on Tesla long-term like I am my opinion is just wait it out. When their valuation falls back down to earth buy in as others panic and sell.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-09 23:40:06'] I think its a lazy estimate. which isn't to imply it's inherently bad. Its good way to get a quick idea of a company/ stock if you've not got alot of time. But as with most quick options, it carries a huge amount of risk. It assumes and applies alot of market averages to a specific company, that has already proven to be an outlier mere days ago. It doesn't really address or even guess at the cause of the recent hype.The article also greatly underestimates and generalizes Teslas products as simply Auto and tech industry. Which is incredibly vague, not to mention Tesla specifically has very unique products among the auto industry and potential products. The company does also attract alot of hype and is popular among ametures and people not even involved in trading, with a very public CEO. As such social media and their silly stunts can have huge unpredictable impacts.In short i think it's detrimental to rely soley on financial stats and especially to try and break them down into only 4 key values.

For example, I know a few people who were early investors of TSLA, pre-pre-split, $20.

You could put that same effort into a higher returning position instead.If you do think it'll keep growing, there's no reason to "protect" it.You can just hold and see what happens, too, but I wouldn't put anything extra into those.One factor to consider is dividends, which soften the blow if your position is down. TSLA has no dividend and, I expect it won't any time soon, so your choice with that in particular comes down to growth alone.You can boil it down to a simple question: if someone gifted you the cash value of your TSLA position today, would you buy TSLA with it, or do something else?

The economic dangers of a stock bubble come from people taking on debt to buy shares and from companies overinvesting. \n\n-When the bubble pops, overextended shareholders have to cut spending or go bankrupt. Companies suddenly faced with investors demanding a return have to lay off workers and slash investment.\n\n-None of this is an issue for the obvious bubbles under way in the fashionable stocks of the moment\n\n-Even if TSLA vanished tomorrow, it would have an insignificant effect on the economy, as Teslas operations are tiny.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 02:49:11'] I'm going to sum up tsla in very short because people hate me when I don't love their playsSince the company's existence all they have done is burn cash. They have never made money on their car business and take on more debt and sell a ridiculous amount of shares and the stock is rewarded. In 2020 tsla sold 499,000 cars the most ever and lost money...the profit is made from selling ev credits to other manufacturers, so that the other manufacturers want to produce evs... so no tsla actually has never been profitable On tsla balance sheet of 19 billion or so cash...and 13 billion debt...this cash is absolutely not from the car business....this is from the stock market...they sold nearly 20 billion worth of shares out of thin air....

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 19:09:43'] Who knows what will happen, but I can guarantee you that TSLA will not go up 700% every year, and I'm 99% sure it won't happen again this year -- you never know with FOMO investors though. Even Cathie Wood isn't that bullish (or foolish) on Tesla.For those new to investing, good news doesn't necessarily mean the stock will go up in price. A company can report great earnings, but the stock drop 5%. Yes the Democratic party is more friendly to green companies, but that doesn't mean TSLA will go up in price.If you believe that TSLA at the current price is a good investment then buy and hold. I feel like too many people holding TSLA are trying to convince others to buy and hold because they lack the conviction to hold the investment themselves without knowing that others are doing the same. This is why they get so angry when people sell their shares.I was buying TSLA when it crashed from 280 to 190 pre-split. At that time everyone was saying how stupid of an investment TSLA was. They were saying Tesla was going bankrupt, stock was going to zero. blah, blah blah. Man how times have changed.I sold most of my shares, with just a tiny percentage left that I will hold for at least 10 years. Yes, if the stock 2x or 3x this year I will have missed out on massive gains, but meh whatever. A great stock that you overpay for can be a bad investment.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 09:16:52'] I will be holding Tesla because I think it will remain steady except for a scary but short lived dip early next week. Funds that are indexed to the S&P 500 will buy Tesla in the last 15 minutes on Friday, and brokerages and market makers will sell shares that they either bought ahead of time or will borrow to these indexed funds. Any shares that are borrowed to sell to the indexed funds will need to be bought back in the following weeks, providing support for the stock. Another source of support will be funds benchmarked to the S&P 500, 90% of which have not bought any Tesla yet, and are likely waiting until after inclusion to see if they can get a good deal on Tesla shares and avoid buying into a volatile time. Ultimately they will want to buy Tesla up to equal weight sooner rather than later because otherwise they are risking their alpha.Anyway, I think people are fearful of Tesla because of the ‚Äúvaluation‚Äù and how it ran up so far so fast. I don‚Äôt think too many people realize that Tesla‚Äôs P/E is about to be cut in half from just one quarter of earnings and then in half again over 2021 (forward P/E is around 250).

Then next week I'll be buying back one (I'm expecting it to drop a bit because thats what tends to happens when most companies are added to the S&P). And I'm using the other share I sold to pay off my monthly car loan and my full credit card balance.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 05:08:08'] Im retarded and just going on stuff i have seen on this forum and talking with others. I bought Tesla for longterm and expect for it to hit $800 within the next year or two. After i asked a friend who trades stocks for a living what he thinks and he said he actually thinks it could reach $1000 next year if Biden helps out the EV market and their sales continue to go up. But he says it will definitely be a bumpy road. If you have more money to invest i would hold and buy more if it drops. If you want to sell and buy back that depends on your tax rate. I don't think if it does drop it will go to far past 600 maybe 575. If it rises enough by the end of today that a drop to 600-575 will still leave you enough profit after paying off the taxes then go for it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 05:00:25'] I'm considering selling a sixth of my shares because I do expect a drop. That said, it would go directly against my normal buy and hold strategy and I would buy them back even if they go up after the 18th. It would be a bit of a "good odds" bet for me, as I think the odds the stock will lose some of its gains after the 18th is about 3 to 1.That said, I don't intend to actually get rid of any my shares for good within 5-10 years.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 06:13:29'] Selling, just not sure when yet.

POST: ['2020-07-08 15:56:35'] POST TITLE: b'My 1 year TSLA ride and how I DCA out of my position.'
POST_TEXT: b"Hi all. Today I officially closed out my Tesla position at least for the time being. For me the price has gotten to high for my personal comfort level so I sold my last 2 shares and I feel fine about it. Here is a story of my 1 year ride on the Tesla coaster. \n\nMy first purchase was 5 shares back in June of 2019 @ a price of $220 a share. I work in the solar industry and was seeing how many power walls my company was installing to pair with solar projects. I also was noticing more and more Tesla's on the road and this is what swayed my decision to jump into what at the time was considered a bad stock. By July the stock was up to $260 and I was feeling great about my investment. Earning were just around the corner so I decided to hold and see what happens. It did not go well. The stock dropped right back to my purchase price and even dipped below a few times. I stuck with it because I believed in the company and my position never got to -10% which is a rule I try to follow and cut loses"
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 16:55:46'] Hey, don‚Äôt kick yourself for not selling at the top, nobody can time the market perfectly.Remember that you met the number 1 goal of investing, don‚Äôt lose money.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 16:13:03'] Nothing wrong with securing profits if you need the cash or think it's overvalued. I think it has a long way to go.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 19:01:29'] Your story is a perfect illustration of time in the market, not timing the market. Stop selling and just keep purchasing regardless of cost if you've done the fundamental research.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 16:11:59'] Nice write up. I'm on a bit of the same ride with amzn but plan on holding till the bitter end
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 18:48:29'] I'm proud of you for not holding on until you hear that pop.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-09 02:20:02'] This will be similar to the posts some years ago that were boasting they bought Amazon at 200$ and sold at 800$. Now they are kicking themselves
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 20:50:01'] Remember it‚Äôs never too late to jump in
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 22:14:00'] Selling now isn‚Äôt a bad idea, Tesla really seems to be a bubble, so you might as well make money while you can.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 22:15:19'] I've been doing the same thing with AAPL. Except I'm 8 years in. Topped out at 350 shares around 2014 and have been slowly pairing that down to the 180 I have left. I'm a big fan of DCA on selling a stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-09 09:17:38'] Congrats on the profits and all, but none of this is DCA. DCA is really just the principle of putting a consistent dollar value into a stock on a schedule, and ignoring any concept of individual share  value, as opposed to purchasing a set quantity of shares on a schedule. I don't see any sort of strict schedule to your selling or buying, and purchasing some stocks, and then selling them later also isn't DCA. Nice job and all, but it's the wrong term.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-09 09:57:53'] I'm still sitting on 7 shares I bought for $215. I should probably sell but I'm riding this bitch out
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 16:02:21'] i literally just bought in to make it 10% of my portfolio eod(after missing all the gains). tesla goin to 2k homeboy
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-08 17:31:59'] How are you going to be taxed since you sold 2 shares 1 year after your first purchased and the rest before the 1 year mark?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-09 08:15:06'] I feel like DCA is a powerful concept that helps investors overcome the fear of marjet volatility and avoid the major pitfalls of timing.  I.E. it is a powerful strategy for building positions in a portfolio.  The flip side of DCA is portfolio balance which is akin to what you are describing.  If tesla is a 5x for an investor the position size has likely grown outsized to its allotment in your overall portfolio and warrents some profit taking/rebalancing of all positions relative to one another.

TSLA keeps me awake at night and I simply couldn't handle the pressure. I believe it might go up even more but I decided to take what I had gotten and get out for now. I decided to keep a single share though just to see what happens to it and to track the price should it fall back down as it did a few months back.

The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMusk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but its possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.\n\nIn April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.\n\nMusk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.\n\n-----------\n\n$TSLA TESLA UPDATED INSIDER BUYING / SELLING OVER THE LAST YEAR  \n  \nBuy Trans'

POST_TEXT: b"A lot of shit is happening around us these days. Stocks are in the bloody stage these days. but some companies are trying to move up nonetheless. \n\nlooking at the TSLA stock performance during the last 3 months I feel like people are disappointed in TSLA. Im kinda disappointed at least, TSLA was strong during the tough times but not anymore. Elon is making random decisions that I am not sure how will ends up. I feel like his focus is shifting. \n\nWVAGY is taking off, Im not sure if it is a good replacement for TSLA or not. But it feels like it is  serious . Im looking long terms like 1-2 years investment. Is this german company going to take over the TSLA? I know some people say TSLA vs Volkswagen is like Apple vs Samsung. \nwell, samsung isn't that bad overall IMO...\nsome brokers have not added Volkswagen to their stocks yet (e.g. I cannot trade in on webull, but I can on Robinhood). But I think Volkswagen is just starting, it can have a good ride up plus cars is what they do. \n\nIm open"
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 17:08:39'] Car companies are extremely mature. I would be very cautious expecting insane gains there. Realistically even if VW makes EVs how much will their revenue increase? People are pricing in Tesla to be an everything company like amazon. Not just a car company. And to this tune car companies are now being treated as psuedo growth companies with EV.I think VW will make better cars but no car company has the tesla appeal (charging network, engineering culture, ground up approach, less 3rd parties involved).
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 11:39:32'] You spelt Volkswagen wrong it's actually Voltswagen
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 13:31:36'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 11:56:16'] Tesla is innovative. You see their company diversified beyond vehicles. They have energy, starlink and rockets. I have 0.03 share of TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 11:56:08'] I'm buying as much Voltswagen as I can! I like the company, regardless of their EV move. It's a good move for them I think. Like you said, cars is what they do. And the EV tech is available. It's not like they are going to have to invent it. They also have a well known, and generally trusted brand. They are "the peoples car."I bought VW before the EV news because my first car was a 1972 VW Beetle. It's the only vehicle I've completely taken apart, and put back together again. This EV news is just catalyst for me to buy more than I already would have. And it could raise the share price without a doubt.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 13:53:51'] They aren‚Äôt even close to being the same company. Tesla yeets money at shit that Volkswagen would never touch. Tesla‚Äôs barely even a car manufacturer at this point, they made more selling their carbon credits than they did on their cars. Bitcoin? The fuck? Sure, yeah, if you believe in crypto. But what is it that Tesla exactly does? Is it cars? Crypto? Carbon credits? Battery technology? Starlink? Space habitats? Who the fuck knows at this point. Tesla is investing in ‚ÄúThe Future‚Äù while VW is investing in a car maker. They aren‚Äôt in the same ballpark.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 13:41:57'] Do yourself a favor. Go test drive a top of the line VW. And do the same for Tesla. If you can‚Äôt test drive them, just sit inside, it‚Äôs enough, I promise. I did the same, and I knew immediately which company I wanted to invest in. Made a bunch of tendies already.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 13:13:23'] Given the difference in manufacturing capabilities, there is no question of Voltswagen replacing Tesla, so much as just zooming past them in the fast lane.Tesla will remain able to sell their cars, but the stock price seems to act like it is a "tech stock" that can scale in an unlimited way, and that's just not the case. Manufacturing is difficult to scale, and it doesn't get easier as you get bigger. And the Musk temper-tantrums with California don't help, because scaling requires good relationships with state governments. And it may turn out that other carmakers are already so invested in the South that the Tesla won't find a favorable environment there just by being anti-California; his competitors might actually prefer to see him stumble, and they've already invested in the local politics.Meanwhile, VW can just convert existing plants all over the world, retrain existing workers, etc. It is questionable if Tesla was ever even noticeable competition for VW.üëº

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-30 14:32:09'] FWIW, go pull up a long term chart of TSLA. The 'you are here' point on this chart is a freefall from a massive runup. Tulip bulb mania, roaring 20's, 1999 internet bubble, 2007 housing bubble, all this shit had the same run up before it tanked. To get long TSLA, I would like to see what happens in a real bear market or deep correction. If TSLA reaches a low point and bottoms out before the indices, I think it's a solid buy. AAPL AMZN did the same thing during 2008 and it led to a full decade of solid returns. Right now, there are too many dreamers and likely bagholders praying TSLA will go back up. But I don't think there is enough margin and speculative fervor to do it. Not after the ramp it had and not in a world where the 10 year is widely expected to shoot up to 2.25%.

GM, Ford, BMW, Toyota, Chinese companies (like NIO), Tata Motors. There are many other car manufacturers, all of them investing in hybrids or EVs."  looking at the TSLA stock performance during the last 3 months I feel like people are disappointed in TSLA" I am sorry, but how can I take you seriously after this?Tesla had an insane rally in 2020, so now we have a healthy and long-time anticipated correction. Disappointed are guys, who lack fundamentals or fresh investors seeking instant gains in a bearish market. Imo a great buy, but maybe not yet.VW is like the "Buy the Rumour, Sell the News" stock now. It will have its momentum for some time, but who knows how it will behave. It's a solid company, so you should make a profit in the long-term eventually.Personally, I just swing trade some NIO shares, because I like the company and their cars. Plus, some fractional shares of Tesla @$600 to avg down every >10% drop. I am cautious bout automotive industry, so it's <10% of my portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 14:27:29'] I‚Äôve had Tesla for 10 yrs and I‚Äôm up 2400% so just shut up, he says with a smile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 11:43:22'] There are a few reasons for that: sentiment. Tesla is a very controversial and volatile stock. It is used heavily for trading and people easily FOMO in when sentiment is good or sell, when it is bad. Gains make it a fun and "cool" investment, while losses make Elon Musk a horrible CEO. Regardless of if those statements are true or not.Additionally it depends heavily on interest rates. Most cash flows to shareholders are expected to come in the future, so changes in interest rates change the present value of those drastically. Distant earnings are uncertain and predictions on how high they will be can change daily, depending on small pieces of information (market share, current sales, brand loyalty, successes/failures in their investments/research/production/autonomous driving...).Overall a very risky and volatile investment and at least i am not comfortable to say to any degree of certainty what the future cash flows will be and which price might be appropriate for them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 16:11:51'] Always inverse r/stocksI saw that the forum was calling Tesla the most toxic asset to hold way back in January. You can go back and read the comments they're hilarious.That's when I bought more.Doing the opposite of r/stocks never fails. It's like inverse Cramer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 11:35:08'] The sharpest portion of TSLA's downturn was based on nothing of substance. Mostly anecdotes about how people were never going to buy another Tesla ever because they didn't like the CEO's shitposting on Twitter. It wasn't a sustainable downturn. Q4 earnings came in and Tesla killed it again. The smart shorts took their gains and gtfo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 12:39:31'] The hate was hilarious. I swear I saw everyone jumping to hate on tesla / musk even on topics that had nothing to do with it. It was... suspicious, way way too much. I hate all the tinfoil bullshit, but I've never seen anything like this. I see stocks getting hate, billionaires getting hate, but the level of hate, and going from that to silence and then to bullish, and the speed of that transition, was insane.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 13:43:38'] Amongst the widespread financial hysteria of the past few years that hit everything (Sports cars, Meme stocks, crypto, NFT, used luxury watches, comic books, pokemon cards, etc.) Tesla was the only thing that got caught in the hype that was actually backed by a real company that owns real assets and generates real income. Now that all the other bullshit has mostly unwound itself, people are selling off their useless trinkets and digital nonsense and piling into the only the only "exciting" investment that kinda sorts makes sense.It's true Tesla was still overvalued at $100 a share, so it was still a bad long term investment, and it's an even worse long term investment now. But for people who like trading and look to the stock market for excitement, the long term prospects don't really matter.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 11:37:44'] Everyone who was going to sell, sold. It's called capitulation. Tax loss selling did this to a number of names. Once you run out of sellers, a stock price can go up really quickly when people want to buy it. There was a lot of money on the sidelines to come in, so the stock goes up a lot. It doesn't mean any long term predictions were right or wrong, it's just how short term movements happen on the market.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-30 16:49:03'] It's of course incredibly important to not put all your eggs in one basket... but 'bubble bursting' on the tech sector is not something that would play out like the .dot com burst in the early 2000s.  Speculators were literally lining up to give anyone with an Internet idea their money, the sector was full of junk companies.  Now you have companies like MSFT, AMZN, etc that are incredibly solid companies that will rise and fall with the markets and independently based on their own performance... but the likelihood that one day everyone is like this 'Internet/Computer' thing is going nowhere and just pull their money out of the sector is very unlikely. But adding an ETF that isn't tech heavy as part of a balanced portfolio is a good idea... I'll be watching/researching the ideas here.

	COMMENT: ['2020-08-30 21:59:38'] I think the concept of "tech sector" is outdated, because the companies within it do such different things at the same time that what is labelled as "technology" is much more central to to the economy overall. In respect to the second point, if "tech" tanks the whole damn market is going down with it, so it's pointless to try to hedge your bets against a collapse (though that doesn't mean you shouldn't diversify).

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 13:35:53'] **Most important piece of advice anyone can give you:** ignore everyone who says you should buy company X. Certain ETFs, like VOO, are very low risk if you just dollar cost average over time, but every single company is risky unless you have a very good understanding of the business, products, leadership, financials, etc. You could buy the best stock in the world and still lose money on it because you didn't understand it and bought and/or sold it at a bad time.That said, it doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in single stocks. We as retail investors have a huge advantage over institutions and money managers because we don't lose clients or targets if we underperform the market in the short term. For example, being 100% TSLA would've been a disaster for any money manager a whole bunch of times in the last 4 years, while as a retail investor you could've just held through it all and be up 10x vs the S&P's 1.5x. Besides, owning single stocks is a lot more fun than owning an index fund, which also motivates you to not spend your money on shit you don't need and invest even more.The only downside is that it requires a lot of work, and it will take a few years before you're knowledgeable enough to analyse companies well enough to determine which ones are worth holding long term. You will unquestionably lose money on some (or all) of them along the way, but if you enjoy it and you're willing to do the work, it'll be a huge positive in your life in the long run. And you're still very young, so you got plenty of time to learn!

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 05:14:17'] As most have said - the safest pick is VOO. Just own the entire S&P 500 instead of trying to beat it. That said, a good way to think of rank ordering risk might be;1) VOO, it‚Äôs the S&P 500.2) VGT/SPYG/QQQ/Similar. Broad based but more tech focused than VOO. Maybe slightly more risk but more upside too.3) Sector based ETFs like XLF for financials or XLI for industrials. If you like a sector you can invest in one of these funds to get broad exposure vs. picking 1 or 2 individual stocks.4) Individual stocks. The most upside but also the most downside. Any one stock can go bankrupt, even when you think it can‚Äôt (Enron). Buy and reassess, don‚Äôt buy and hold. You need to always ask the question if you had 100% cash today would you own the same holdings? If no, sell and reallocate.I‚Äôd suggest mostly investing in 1-3 above until you feel comfortable enough analyzing individual companies (maybe you already do) then venturing into 4. Just make sure you never get too heavy in one individual holding and please avoid trashy, scammy ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stocks like the plague.Congrats on getting started early.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 03:07:54'] It's great that you start thinking about investing early...but 50$ is like what you will earn in half a day later on. At this age you should probably spend it on yourself.If you do want to invest then think about what kind of investor you want to be. Slow and steady (which will give you some extra financial padding later on - but it's not going to make you rich). In this case something like VOO works well.orMore risk and potential high reward (or high loss). I.e. the type of investor who invests money that isn't important to him whether he loses it all (because he's got sufficient income elsewhere to lead a trouble-free life in case his investments go south). This type of investor wants a shot at early retirement (which VOO or similar isn't going to give you). In this case you need to do research into companies and invest in individual stocks (e.g. Tesla) or buy some other, more risky products.**TL;DR:** Know what type of investor you want to be and the choice of where to invest becomes obvious.

One chapter that really stood out to me tells the story of a legendary art collector who made a fortune by buying lots and lots of art, including works by the likes of Picasso and Pollock.Link to book here: [https://amzn.to/3DITcRO](https://amzn.to/3DITcRO)  At the end of his life, he sold his collection to the German government for $100m - a price that was seen as an incredible deal. People looked at the collection and wondered how one man could have possibly known 60 years ago that some of these artists would become enormous names. The truth is, his tactic was simple: he bought lots and lots of art and just waited to see which pieces would be the biggest.    The same idea applies to stocks. Even if most of the stocks you buy don't perform that well, if just a few takeoffs, you'll be in a great position. And that's the beauty of the stock market - it's not just about capitalism, it's about how the world, and how nature works. We are the result of a long change of nature trying 1000 different things and then just running with whatever works best.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 05:08:54'] I just want to say it‚Äôs awesome that you are investing so early and dollar cost averaging into VOO. It‚Äôs also good that you have individual stocks of interest . I would suggest increasing the percentage of your money in VOO as it hold the largest 500 companies in the US. This decreases your risk and support ‚Äúmarket perform gains‚Äù. With that said if you have an interest in Tesla and Microsoft and have studied their business and use their products, I encourage investing a modest amount of your overall funds in those companies. All the best in your investment journey.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 06:31:50'] The best way to lose your money is by listening to other people telling you what to do with it. Becoming a savvy investor takes patience and maturity. Acting on a stock tip from reddit won‚Äôt make your parents proud. However, studying the market and execution of what you learned from your research will. Even if your wrong sometimes, and you will be, as long as you learned something you‚Äôll be successful. Investing is just like everything else in life, you‚Äôre only going to get out of it what you put into it. Study! Study the great traders! Read or listen to their books, research market mechanics, buy companies for a reason. Entering the market is like drinking very hot coffee, take little sips first so you don‚Äôt burn yourself. One of my Favorite stock quotes is from Warren Buffet: ‚ÄúThe stock market is a way to take money from the impatient.‚Äù

If umbrella policies cover BMW but not Tesla, high net worth buyers with huge umbrella policies will choose BMW rather than lose their coverage.-Foot in the door in China, but they are now exposed to the risk of Chinese government interference.-Tesla brand resonates poorly with pickup owners, and Ford seems to be in the lead for EV pickups (and they have great brand equity with that market)-Panasonic issues.

The loser isn't Tesla in this scenario, it's Mercedes and BMW.

Tesla is not that. They are missing an important ingredient and I think young investors just don‚Äôt know that change can happen with companies that are also run well.You‚Äôre not being anti-electric vehicles by acknowledging that Tesla is poorly run.
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-04 02:31:12'] I see all the comments are not in favour for a buy on Tesla.  However as an investor, I consider the long term prospect of a company.  Tesla in my opinion has the potential to bounce back in the coming years.  The company is spending so much on long term investment just to help it control the whole supply chain of EVs.  But if you are still afraid,  there's going to be a stock buy back soon.  You can wait and sell around that time.  Otherwise I advise you to stick to the reason you chose Tesla.  Everyone here is giving you their own opinions about Tesla but the question really is what do you think?  In stocks trading opinions varies and the fact that majority are saying a different thing doesn't mean you are wrong.  Mind you,  90% of stock traders lose money.  Stick to your analysis and believe in your trade. My only advice is to have a stop loss. The price at which you get out of the trade.

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-04 05:40:17'] I have about 5% invested in Tesla. I rode it out for quite a while, sold at a 5% profit right after Elon smoked pot on video and started his pissing match with the FTC. I laughed as the stock tanked, then bought in again as it recovered. Panic is a stupid reason to buy or sell. I pay no attention to the ups and downs, figure this is a long term bet that might pay off. Everything else is in boring dividend stocks and ETFs.

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-04 09:28:14'] Add to your fears, Elon Musk.  Elon Musk lost control of the company because he was making massive grandiose public announcements and projections about Tesla and its future... while on investor calls he was saying the complete opposite.  This drove up Tesla's share price artificially and made it a target for short sellers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 14:41:00'] Caveat to this is that my father worked at one of the large banks that provided security analysis for Enron, among other dot com era frauds. These price targets have less to do with the analysts not understanding how to do securities analysis and more to do with these companies and their c suite being very large customers of the banks in both the commercial and investing wings. Glass-Steagall yo.It behooves the banks and their analysts to do this.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 12:03:29'] Not sure about the Enron argument. Analysts can‚Äôt predict fraud
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:43:34'] It's not beneficial to put a sell rating or downgrade a stock. Most of these companies use these institutions for raising capital, etc. Any downgrade would cause the price to decline and piss off the company in question, possibly losing the bank millions in future financing or future M&A deals. NEVER forget this. They will always upgrade the stock actively, and ONLY downgrade once the news is obvious and common street knowledge. No analyst will ever put his career on the line for an early sell rating or downgrade. They eventually have to move in line as its a balancing act with keeping the company ceo, board etc happy, and the credibility of the institution. Your mistaking incompetence and lack of understanding with how the actual function of an analyst role is conducted. Is it absolutely a cop out and shit, but it is what it is...buy side analysts on the other hand, have no conflict of interest as their mandate is to generate the best investment ideas without bias, unfortunately you'll never get buy side research as its the edge for funds. They know exactly what they are doing and playing the game.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 11:29:59'] Except it's not the job of a sell side analyst to be right with their price targets. You're fundamentally misunderstanding what they do, and using that to assert the claim that they don't understand the market.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-25 17:05:07'] Dude. They have their own agenda. The things they say publicly are the things that benefit them if retail follows. If they need exit liquidity, they tell you to buy. If they short, they tell you to sell. They are not there to do you any favours, they are there to make money for themselves. At any cost. There is no "integrity" in this business. They sell their souls so they can live a wealthy life on this earth. It's despicable from a moral point of view but that's what it is. Remember that Goldman Sachs were the first ones to dump the MBS on the other investment banks back in 2007/2008 so they could ""survive"" at the expense of the other greater fools. If they are willing to do such things to their own colleagues, imagine what they are willing to do to you, an "average joe" to them.

The stock then was a little volatile back then and I decided to sell them all at 20 bucks, hoping it will go back to 17 or 18 bucks...it never did and I felt stupid if I were to buy it back at 25.

How would market analysts look at the available information and come to the conclusion that Enron was manipulating the energy markets and blatantly lying in their financial statements? That they had created fake entities to inflate their earnings?That their *respected accounting firms* were in on it? I think the best criticism would be to say "this is too good to be true", but then you'd need the power to subpoena internal documents and the resources to dig through all their obfuscation to prove it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 07:57:54'] I‚Äôm in equity research (and like to think of myself competent lol). There is a lot of structural problems with the industry and the way it‚Äôs regulated (mifid 2) that lend research and stock picking to be an ancillary role. I think you should go into all readership with the assumption that the analyst is primarily interested in driving investment banking revenue, and their stock picking integrity is really just a backup to that. In my role, corporate access is also a huge revenue driver (introducing HF clientele to C suite of coverage) which is not something possible when you have a sell rating on their company haha. When you approach it with those grains of salt I think there is a fair amount of value you can take away.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 08:24:22'] You have to separate sell-side analysts and buy-side analysts. They each have different incentive structures. I wouldn‚Äôt listen to any sell-side analyst about anything ever. The buy-side analysts are paid to be more skeptical. Your example about Enron: The analyst that started asking questions (Bethany McLean) was basically purged from the investment bank industry and had to become a journalist. She‚Äôll probably never be hired on the sell-side again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 09:10:20'] I like the analysis provided by Morningstar.  I pay them for the information, and they provide a detailed explanation for their ratings.  They often update the analysis during earnings, and don't seem to be as quick to change their opinions based on market noise.  The ratings themselves aren't necessarily buy/sell, but rather this is what we consider a fair price, within a certain range, and also if this company has a Buffet style "moat".Could be I'm naive here, but it seems like the best information source I'm going to get as a retail investor.  Also I still take what they say with a grain of salt, but it seems closer to a Consumer Reports service, than a paid shill type service.Finally this is all about predicting the future, so I tend to lump analysis into the same camp as weathermen.

Dotcom crash taught me that none of these analysis know anything about markets or how they work. Yeah man - no shit. The lack of historical context here is pretty embarassing......Enron was hiding about ~$2bn worth of debt in SPVs while also using these SPVs as a way to recognize fraudulent cash flow. They were willfully lying to just about everybody not named Jeff Skilling (shoutout!) or Andy Fastow..........but I'm guessing a super clever little lad such as yourself would have caught it before the entire investing public and regulatory bodies did in 2002........
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 19:56:16'] Having been at the C level in a publicly traded company main subsidiary, I can tell you that analysts are in it to sell stocks. They don't do due diligence and will take the company's word at face value. No industry experience means they can't separate the facts and fiction nor would they really care to. Trading up or down based on upgrades or downgrades makes little sense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 11:52:30'] This thread is a prime reason why you should not learn about the financial world from reddit The sell side doesn't give a shit about retail because there's no money in it. How much did you personally pay Goldman Sachs to see their research? Nothing? So why are you entitled to the same benefits as the buysiders who are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to see research? The sell side is about much more than just picking stocks and it's physically impossible to be good at everything because good analysts work 60-80 hour weeks (more during earnings) just to be good at a handful of those tasks. Of course analysts can be bad at picking stocks. You know why? Because picking stocks is hard, which is why the good stock pickers get paid so much. Even companies are shit at timing their stock buybacks - most buybacks happen at the peak of the market and then fall off as the market declines. If a company can't predict the direction of its own damn stock then why should 3rd party analysts be better?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-26 08:26:09'] I would hope everyone understands that when any of the talking heads are giving their so-called analysis on a stock they're trying to pump a stock up so they can dump it and make a profit. Consequently when any of the big trading firms talk bad about a stock they're trying to beat it down so they can get in at a lesser price. The only thing that matters in a stock when considering a buy or sell is, do they have consistent earnings, do they have positive forecasting negative or positive for the year, are they making any money,  do they have an adequate cash flow.  If you're only interested in short-term trading then it's all about the volume momentum up or down.There is also no doubt that news being heard directly from the CEO's  mouth can sway the direction of a stock but it's rare that you hear these things in public except when you're talking about Elon musk who quite frankly should just STF up

POST_TEXT: b'Store closures, model Y reveal, stock declining. Whats going on with this company? Any thoughts?'
	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 09:17:01'] store closing - not a growth company signal. They have fired 15% of their employees and 30 high ranking people have left in the last 6 months. CFO, COO and others I believe. They also had $1b bond to pay in cash too. ITs a mess all around.
	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 11:37:01'] The store closures seems to be directly tied to the delivery problems with the 3 role out.  People who tried to pick up their 3's at the store frequently complained about the utter confusion around the delivery of the vehicle.  Meanwhile, the home delivery are the most popular with buyers because the company is only dealing with you at time of delivery, your not standing around waiting for them to finish cooking the pizza, its right there ready to eat.  Elon isn't afraid to change course when something isn't right.  We've seen it time and time again.  I for one won't be betting against the billionaire whose spaceship just docked with the space station.

	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 11:17:37'] Tesla have made the $35,000 Model 3 as soon as possible.The market, overall, has completely mis-read the recent price drops across their vehicles. The market thinks demand is slowing and Tesla is cutting prices to increase demand.In fact, the cost per kWh of their batteries is decreasing along an exponential cost curve, and economies of scale are coming in to play. Tesla is passing on these savings as soon as they can. The battery cost is going to CONTINUE to fall, indefinitely. This means margins will continue to climb and Tesla will continue to have the option of lowering costs (the battery is by far the largest cost item in their vehicles).Moving to an online-only sale model is a masterstroke. The market has misread this as desperation, but Tesla have done it to assist in lowering prices.This is the tightest Tesla will be financially for their forseeable future. Q1 2019 will probably be the last month Tesla does not show a profit, period.Hardly a single analyst, except for ARK's Catherine Woods understands the big play here:Tesla's fleet of cars is going to become part of an autonomous, on-demand transport network like Lift/Uber. Owners will be able to add their cars to the fleet when not in use and Tesla will take a clip of all rides, AND Tesla can also produce it's own vehicles to add directly to the fleet. THE MORE TESLAS ON THE ROAD, THE MORE THEIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN AI SELF DRIVING PULLS FURTHER AHEAD. No one else has CLOSE to the amount of miles driven. If memory serves, Tesla has more than 30x as many miles of data than anyone else.Estimates put them about 3 years ahead of the competition in self driving AI... and their new. GPU is 2000% better than the NVIDIA chip they were using..
	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 09:55:35'] They have done a 180 on stores and seem to be making some reactionary announcements. Its likely that demand in Europe and China isn't as high as they hoped...couple that with softening US demand and the outlook isn't the greatest at the moment. I still see this as short team noise and I will not bet against Musk as long as he is running this company.

	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 13:57:30'] Personally, I like what Tesla is about and the change the company is pushing broader society to adopt, like embracing electric automobiles for the masses--in my opinion, it's a noble pursuit and a fun company to watch from the sidelines. But why from the sidelines? From an investment standpoint, the fundamentals just aren't there. Tesla struggles with profitability, operates on slim margins, has high levels of debt, more speculative and hopeful investors than rational ones, and generates a negative return on assets, equity, and invested capital, for starters. Not to mention that competition is catching up; competitors with a much stronger balance sheets, resources, and experience are producing fully-electric vehicles with comparable quality. Management at Tesla has been a merry-go-round with a host of key executives contributing to the high turnover rate of employment in important positions, which is not good from a strategic standpoint. Operationally, they've historically been struggling with meeting manufacturing output, and they're notoriously difficult with processing customer returns, which is another sign that the company is still in the very early stages of its life cycle. In sum, I like what Tesla is about and want to see them succeed--but its stock just carries way too much risk and not enough sense in order to warrant my investment. There are so many better picks an investor can make over Tesla, and it doesn't necessarily mean they dislike the company--myself included.

	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 13:43:24'] Since SA articles are blacklisted, here's the plaintext from one that explains it really well. I've got no affiliation w/ this author, just thought it was a well written article and I tried to post it but the post was automatically removed. Yay censorship! Anyway, good explanation of exactly why TSLA took a dump after their "positive" news:------------------------------SummaryTesla hosted a very secret conference call in conjunction with its Thursday announcement about $35,000 Model 3 and closing most of its stores.A transcript of this secret call has found its way into the public domain. I provide links to it. You were not supposed to read or hear this.Tesla gave new profit and loss guidance, as well as contradicted its written $35,000 Model 3 delivery estimate - June instead of 2-4 weeks from now.Asked about the $35,000 Model 3 profit margin, CEO Elon Musk said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not going to answer questions like that.‚Äù.However, the report from the Deutsche Bank report merely hours thereafter says that Tesla provided precisely this guidance to them privately.Looking for more? I update all of my investing ideas and strategies to members of Auto Insight For Wall St.. Start your free trial today ¬ªLast Thursday afternoon, news started coming across the tape about a company that was closing almost all of its stores, laying off employees, and cutting prices dramatically in what seems like a fire sale. Sears, I wondered?Not quite. It was that $50 billion market cap company, Tesla (TSLA): $35,000 Tesla Model 3 Available Now.In order to elaborate on the matter further, Tesla organized a secret conference call to which only a few of its most loyal fans were invited. You might have thought that Tesla being in recent hot water with the SEC would have meant that Tesla should have avoided keeping the dissemination of most important new guidance to a small selected group, but no. Quoth The Raven commented as follows: Quoth the Raven on Twitter‚ÄúBy the way is $TSLA hosting a secret conference call where they‚Äôre doling out material guidance and ducking questions on margin? And if so, sans an 8-K, how does that not violate securities laws?‚Äù-- Quoth The Raven, aka Chris IronsHowever, the attempt to keep this conference call‚Äôs full contents shielded from the investing public did not succeed any better than former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn‚Äôs telephone call with the Russian Ambassador in January 2017. Within approximately 24 hours, Paul Huettner had transcribed an audio recording of the secret conference call:Paul Huettner, CFA on TwitterIf you prefer a Google Drive link to Paul Huettner‚Äôs transcript of Tesla‚Äôs secret conference call, here it is:Tesla Call Transcript (2.28.19).pdfIt didn‚Äôt take long for The Los Angeles Times to point out one of the glaring inconsistencies in this selective disclosure from Tesla and its CEO: Tesla website and Elon Musk differ on Model 3 delivery dates. Two weeks? Four months?Basically, the Tesla web site says that you can get a $36,200 (including delivery charge) Model 3 in 2-4 weeks, but Musk said on the call that it‚Äôs June - which is clearly not 2-4 weeks from now. LA Times sought clarification from Tesla on this matter, and the company said that Musk‚Äôs word on the secret conference call was the accurate timeline.This is beyond asinine. What Tesla is saying is that its 2-4 week estimated delivery time - which you can see by simply going to Tesla‚Äôs web site and click to configure a Model 3 - is apparently false information. The correct information? Only provided on a secret conference call to a tiny number of Tesla‚Äôs closest fans. That‚Äôs what Tesla admitted to The LA Times.Why would Tesla do this? I have absolutely no idea, but one suspects that Tesla wants people who visit its web site to be tempted to hand over $2,500 while believing that they will get a car in 2-4 weeks. Then, on the conference call, Musk forgot about that bait-and-switch and told what he knew to be the truth - that June is the correct estimate.Just think about it: How on Earth do you get a custom-made car built and delivered in 2-4 weeks? Assuming nobody is ahead of you in line, 2-4 weeks can be a typical all-in delivery time across the country. Surely Tesla isn‚Äôt suggesting that demand is so low that there's almost nobody else ordering this new $36,200 vehicle?Then there‚Äôs that other thing‚Ä¶One of the questions near the end of the secret conference call was this: ‚ÄúWhat is that Tesla‚Äôs profit margin on each and every $35,000 Model 3 sold?‚Äù Musk responded: ‚ÄúYeah. We‚Äôre not going to answer questions like that. Next question.‚ÄùOK, so Tesla doesn‚Äôt want to get into the subject of the $35,000 (plus $1,200 delivery charge) Model 3 margin, in speaking to a group - even on a secret conference call.However, the following day - March 1 - Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner published a report for DB‚Äôs clients called ‚ÄúSR M3 Likely Addresses Issues; Questions Now Back To Margin.‚Äù In this report, DB writes as follows:‚ÄúIn our follow-ups with the company, management outlined a high level bridge to maintaining profitability which includes savings from higher fixed cost absorption‚Ä¶Tesla indicated that initially, the $35k Model 3 will generate a positive cash gross margin (gross profit plus depreciation of approximately $1,500)‚Ä¶.‚ÄùWait a minute! Why is Tesla providing this information selectively to Deutsche Bank? Hours before this report was published, on the secret conference call, CEO Musk said that he is not going to answer questions like that. However, apparently in an even more secret private dialogue between Tesla and Deutsche Bank, Tesla provides this highly important information in the most selective manner possible.Did any of Deutsche Bank‚Äôs competitors get this information too? Did Goldman Sachs? Did Morgan Stanley? I have no idea. One thing is clear: The investing public never got to hear this information, and in this case even the secret conference call participants were told that Tesla is ‚Äúnot going to answer questions like that.‚Äù...Except in private dialogue with Deutsche Bank, apparently.Bottom line: Where is the SEC on all of this?We are barely scraping the surface here, but immediately we find three things:On a secret conference call with outsiders, Tesla provides new profit and loss guidance.On the same secret conference call, Tesla massively contradicts its new Model 3 delivery times - four months instead of 2-4 weeks - and then confirms that what was said on the secret call is the accurate information. Still, as of this writing, Tesla‚Äôs Model 3 order site reflects the information Tesla told LA Times is incorrect.In a private dialogue with Deutsche Bank, Tesla provides gross margin guidance for the $35,000 Model 3 specifically, immediately after having said on the conference call that it was ‚Äúnot going to answer questions like that.‚ÄùThe only conclusion that most investors, who are not part of these privileged management conversations, can say for certain is: Tesla is the boss in the relationship with the SEC, tossing around a submissive SEC staff like a dog owner with a tiny pup on a leash.
	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 13:25:00'] It's a good time to buy TSLA ( I am buying more).  The news is full of FUD to drive the price down.  The stores closing is just streamlining and cutting costs so they can sell their cars as cheap as possible.  All of their sales have gone through the website ordering system, even if you went into the store.  So the stores were not really necessary.  The China Gigafactory will be producing cars in a few months and volume production is expected by the end of this year.  The Model Y targets the biggest auto segment in north america.  They just acquired Maxwell Technologies; their dry cell chemistry offers a 15% to 50% improvement in energy density over current Lion batteries.   Also Tesla keeps cranking out grid scale batteries and the solar roof is on the way (still testing long term durability, targeting 50yr lifetime) . 
	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 12:43:19'] It's simple. The stock was overvalued and the market is correcting itself to more accurately reflect the offering TSLA brings to consumers and, more specifically, investors. TSLA is not a stock of reason, as it is priced emotionally. Some people will hear they're closing stores and they'll want out, not knowing that most of their sales are done online, and Tesla's cars are a different field than ICE vehicles all together. Primarily, they don't appeal to everyone, as not everyone's commute can handle the limited range or charging requirements. So why have a bunch of stores for people to test drive and compare your vehicle when the vast majority of consumers are not your target market? If someone wants a Tesla, they'll find a way to test drive from Tesla.  People want to believe in electric vehicles, because they believe electric vehicles are the future. They want to believe in AI for the same reason. I imagine most people who are heavy in TSLA do not believe it is a short term hold.

I‚Äôm hoping it dips a bit more so I can buy it and do it again. Look at the drop from june to oct of last year. Everyone thought the world would end.

They're all going into electric cars in a big way.  Third, Musk is a bit of an eccentric genius asshole. Firing people for no reason. Raging out. And then his other companies? The Boring Company is a joke. It's never going to work. Pure fakery. Space X is pretty cool, amazing, but it's also bleeding money with an unsustainable burn rate.

	COMMENT: ['2019-03-05 10:20:50'] Seems like they're just not making enough profit. If my memory serves me correctly, they've mentioned that they will not turn a profit this quarter, which is concerning - if they aren't profiting now, when will they ever? How much longer before they finally "optimize" their manufacturing process?Stores closing is a huge red flag for me tbh - definitely not a sign of growth. It seems like in the past a lot of passive buyers were converted after a demo/test drive. Sure Tesla will save money in rent, but I feel like in the long term this will weaken the brand strength. Less casual test drivers = less buzz. Less storefronts = less presence. Sure you might still be able to test drive a Tesla where they bring one to your door, but only motivated buyers already considering Tesla as their next car would probably go through the trouble.Lastly, cutting the price of the Model 3 I feel like alienated their most recent buyers. Imagine if you had just bought the car two months ago how angry you'd be that the value of your car dropped $10-20k in that measly amount of time. And new buyers would probably be hesitant to buy, wondering whether there is going to be another sudden price cutJust my two cents. I'm a Tesla fan and love the cars, but the future doesn't look too bright imo. Change my mind!
