POST: ['2023-05-24 15:47:48'] POST TITLE: b'Dumb Mistake Selling NVIDIA Covered Calls'
POST_TEXT: b"Looking back I made a bad choice of selling NVIDIA covered calls at a strike price of 170 expiring Jan 2024. This was last November when NVIDIA was still priced at 130 or so. At the time, it seemed like a reasonable valuation. Now the stock is 380 after hours, and I'm not sure what to do. Should I roll this farther out and wait for the hype to settle down to a reasonable valuation? The only consolation is that I technically still own the stock and can roll them forever or until assigned, but it just wouldn't be liquid.\n\nFor some extra context, this was around the time the company I was going to join after graduation shut down, tech hiring was a disaster, and I was relying on these covered calls to live off of."
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:07:52'] Close your position and move on. Those calls are no doubt trading for very close to parity now, no reason to keep your capital tied up. Take the small win, take the lesson that you can’t sell covered calls if you’re going to regret it when the stock rips through your short, and move on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:20:23'] You bought at 130 and will sell at 170?  Sounds like profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 16:03:10'] As long as the strike is higher than you paid for the shares, then it's not dumb. Is profit and no risk. Yes, you could have made more, but if you think that way, it will drive you nuts.Remember, any profit is good profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:52:37'] eh, there's no premium left in that call.  You're just tying up capital unnecessarily.  Your strike is so far away now, you're just hoping for a small chance to not even win a bunch of money.  Your covered call as a trade already had the 2nd best outcome, you should close the trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 15:52:03'] Wait till it cools off, you have time to roll or NVDA will continue to go up, RIP either way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:13:14'] Why didn't you roll up higher when it hit 170 back in January? Just curious.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:25:35'] I would close it an move on. It's blocking a lot of capital right now for nothing (no upside). There are better ways to invest your money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 18:50:17'] These covered call situations will get easier to swallow the more it happens! Just let it go and use your cash gains to sell a put on a good stock that's around $170 per share.&#x200B;Also, in the future, never sell a option with an expiration more than 90 days out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 16:15:06'] At least you made a few bucks.  Watching these options go off is a little depressing knowing I decided to go to the real casino this afternoon and blew $600.  wondering what that would be worth had I decided to buy $600 NVDA $325c.  UGH. Guessing like $10k? Stupid is as stupid does.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:24:14'] Lesson learned. Don't sell covered calls so far out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:31:51'] 130 to 170 is 30%+ profit in 15 months.If you could guarantee that to anybody on the street they’d jump at the opportunity. It is what it is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:08:36'] The good thing is you're covered! Isn't it? I will let it go. I have some AI covered calls.  Dam, these cc fuckers blow me out. But I am okay let it go since I make profit, even not much.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:30:03'] never regret making money
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:40:56'] I’m not a fan of selling way otm cc. I’d rather sell and let it get called away quickly to free up cash. At least you didn’t lose
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 18:07:47'] timing is wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:34:16'] It wasn’t a mistake. You made a decision that if you could get 170 for a 130 stock and also make a decent option premium, it would be a great return. And it is so be happy. Yeah, with a crystal ball, you would have mortgaged everything you own and bought 350 call options that expire this Friday. So would I. For now, check and see if there is still any time premium in your option. It is so far itm that there may be little or none. If so, close out the option and the stock and be happy you got the return you hoped for about 8 months early.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 20:00:23'] low growth, high dividend stock are usually better for selling covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:10:28'] What's sold is sold, book your money and be happy, you can't possibly make every trade perfect, no one does.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:20:11'] That trade is done. I sold my huge NVDA position at $150... Actually was forced ti sell due to margin call. Move on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 03:24:56'] There is no consolation. Accept that you were forced to take a decent gain on the stock and pocketed your option premium. Don't piss it away trying to make the trade bend to your will.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 18:09:39'] In hindsight EVERYTHING is a dumb mistake
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 18:59:44'] Let them be called away and start selling puts at the strike they were called with the idea one day to be assigned back.In the meanwhile put the money in US treasury bonds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:07:56'] Unpopular opinion; I honestly believe you should just let it ride.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 16:31:09'] Similar boat but not that far of an expiration, debating on actually closing the cc and selling my 100 shares since my cc is 320c july 21, I could see how much I could roll it or just take the profit and be done with it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 17:50:15'] Hold a week or two for the IV to drop, then BTC and sell the stock for your net profit. There will be very little extrinsic value left after things settle a bit. You’ll get near maximum profit on your play and well before expected! The value of holding the position is essentially zero unless you expect it to drop below 170 this year. In the future, theta has a fairly small effect out past 60 days. The ideal range for selling OTM is 30-45 days. Long term premiums look juicy but don’t have a great return when time is favored in. Congrats!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 18:30:22'] Close it out and open a diag call credit spread if you still want some skin in the game.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:16:33'] You shouldn't rely on covered calls to live off.  Tough mistake but hopefully good lesson.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:36:10'] Selling a bear call credit spread tomorrow. Hopefully it opens at like 380 385. Gonna go big i think, 6months out. And wait for it to crash. That market caps gotta be close to 1 trillion
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:44:55'] Wait for the dust to settle a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:53:02'] Be patient for now.  Definitely don’t roll these calls tomorrow if the stock is making a big move up.  Wait a few days for sure.  I think these will get a lot cheaper sometime between now and 2024.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:56:20'] It will keep going up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 20:03:28'] I sold 9 otm weeklies for around $12 each this week. Every singe quarterly lately regardless if it’s good or bad has seen the stock slide. Tonight i pocketed a quick $11k this week. My luck. I missed out on $76k profits in a week. Fun times.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 20:54:01'] Close your position and move on. NVDA ended up getting called for me at 130 and I sold a couple more bull put spreads to try to get it back but nah it was over. It’s fine. That’s the price you pay sometimes for some stability. FOMO is real and hurts. Just be glad you didn’t sell uncovered calls this week lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:41:05'] Close them at close to parity and move on. Mental capital > Real Capital.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:42:48'] If you are in the profit then just let it run until expiration. Its a big loss to cover your calls right now. Just hope someone exercises your options early to open up some buying power.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:45:50'] thats the risk of selling covered calls, you miss out on upside
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 21:46:57']  you are pretty much in the same position as someone who sold  naked long  shares  at 170 &#x200B;The option is just there to remind you of your mistake.   Get rid of it .

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 23:30:01'] It could be worse.... You could have sold naked calls.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 03:04:25'] Not a dumb mistake at all. You made two profits on NVDA - capital appreciation on the stock, and pure profit on the covered call.You have options: buy back the call, extend it out and increase the strike price, or leave it as is.You can roll it out to Jan 17 2025 - $390 or $400 and make additional income on that call.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 04:32:22'] Always stay away from long-term short positions.  Even if the profit will be slim, you want a nice fast theta decay to get you out of any risk.Close your position.  Take whatever recovery you can by selling your shares and move on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 05:28:03'] Shut it down and move on to the next trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 05:28:50'] I learned a long time ago a gain is a gain.. if you get caught up on what you left on the table it will drive you mad.. it will tie you to emotional trading and emotional trading will lead to losses. Take the gain on the covered call, learn a lesson, ask yourself what went wrong and what went right and how you can maximize effectiveness on the next trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 05:39:51'] I sold some dec 2023 265 covered calls. I'm just going to keep rolling up over the next few years or until they are assigned..it is what it is profit is profit.Took me awhile to realize to ignore "what could have been" because you would be feeling the exact opposite of what you are right now if the stock tanked. Either way you made profit, so just keep rolling or take the profit, your choice.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 06:00:54'] 7 months to go on these, let them run.  Unless someone exercised the option, you still own the shares and the small dividend it pays.  Close to end of year would be when you want to look at this position again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 06:08:13'] You can buy the contract by purchasing the same strike and expiration. The position should close after that
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 06:19:58'] Hindsight always has perfect vision.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 06:54:37'] I'm in the same position with AMD.  Going to let my shares go and just move on.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:20:16'] What about selling puts and using the credit to roll your calls up?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 07:54:00'] If you roll up to a higher strike price with a small net credit, you technically will make an additional profit. Eg, from 170 to 175, the additional $5 is the profit for being illiquid for x amount of time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 08:50:23'] I'm the dumbest person of all. I sold puts on them with a 250 strike, back last spring. I rolled it forward and divided it into 2 puts when the price dropped, and had two puts with a 210 strike. I got hit when the price dropped down to 130, and got assigned. I figured wheel strategy and sold everything from 150 to 170 calls. At the end of 2022 I exited the position of holding 200 NVDA shares with an assigned price of 150 and adjusted cost basis around 175. It was a tax loss sell. Biggest fucking mistake of my life, as I should've sold my square shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 09:19:58'] I just sold about 10 shares of stock 2 days ago. I’m in the same boat as you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 12:15:12'] No need to go longer than 2 weeks when selling a call imo. It reduces the chance of blowing past your stirke. Tough lesson. I'd just wait it out and take max profit instead of taking the L and rolling
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 13:46:25'] You were thinking nvda would take two years to only do 30% growth from where it was….

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 17:36:51'] Personally, I would never hold a covered call for more than 45 days. With that being said though, i would just wait and see what happens. You will be profiting either way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 19:22:11'] I'd roll it out. If it's costing you $20K to close just look for the Jan or Dec 25 calls with the same premium price
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 03:43:57'] It's free money until it's not
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 10:39:42'] This is the downside to covered calls on a volatile position. The purpose of owning the stock is that’s it’s risky but has high reward. Covered calls cap the high reward but you still owned the risk.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 10:54:40'] you can't roll a Jan 2024 170 C when spot is at 390.  That is....roll for a profit.  You are only rolling for time and the hope that NVDA massively dumps in the future.  You are going to get your shares called away.  Take consolation that you will make some profit.  There is virtually no extrinsic on that deep ITM short call.  I would considered closing the entire trade and move on.  Deploy your capital somewhere else.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 11:04:23'] I read the top 1/3 of comments and the things being written are daft.  Your short ITM is so deep it has $6 of extrinsic.  This is against $388 of intrinsic.  If you want to wait until Jan 24 to make $6/share, when the share price is $388, then go ahead.  That is a 1.5% return in 9 months.  You would make more money investing in the ETF BIL, which invests in the short term UST 1-3 mo which has an yield of 5% right now.  You made a bet that at the end of the day will make you profit, but not nearly as much as you could have made.  There isn't anything you can do about it.  The last thing you should do is close the CC for a loss.  Just close the entire trade.Why do you want to roll it?  Rolling in the hopes that NVDA will close below 170?  At best you can roll to Dec 2025 210, and now you need NVDA to crap the bed just a little less.  So you are going to sit on those shares for 2 WHOLE YEARS...waiting for a black swan event.  Anyone recommending that you roll is just dumb daft

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 19:21:28'] Roll it ITM in to gain back on some premium and hope it goes down below that by then.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 09:28:07'] Sometimes you just have to sit on your hands and not sell premium.   If you would Just did that.  You would have collected 5 years worth of selling options in one day from capital gains in stock.  No way you’ll be able to roll out $100 worth of intrinsic value without paying a huge debit.  Then your not patient so it’ll drop back and you lose that debit.  I’m going take a leap and say you sold cc below your cost basis.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 04:21:02'] The old adage that the market can stay solvent longer than you is not a myth. I still remember in the beginning of my trading activity of buying puts on AAPL because it was "too overbought for too long". It was an expensive lesson.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 06:30:18'] Wait for RSI to show bearish divergence then place your short trades. But based on the continuance of this uptrend I wouldn't hold short on QQQ for very long. My plan for QQQ is go short on bearish divergence of RSI and then cut the trade if RSI gets to 50.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 06:38:35'] I find oscillators, including RSI, work a lot better in range-bound situations. If a chart is trending, don’t try to go countertrend just because a RSI looks maxed out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 07:47:30'] Every sub I see is extremely bullish.  Good news is good news again.  There is a case for short term bullishness but the deck is stacked to the downside.   We all know the negatives we face by now so no reason to list them but here’s some interesting things. The US has had 14 recessions since the depression.  Only 3 were considered “soft landings”.  None of the 3 had large increases in assets prior to the recession.  “Soft landing” has been used before.  Most notably was Bernanke in 2007.  That term has been used since the 1950s and the only recessions I can find that the idea of a soft landing wasn’t used was when we actually had soft landings.  Policy induced recessions have always been the worst.  There’s evidence that track record actually goes back 100s of years.  The 3 soft landings described above were not policy induced.  The last and only time we had we such a divergence between tech and the rest of the market was right before the worst part of the decline in the .com crash.  We have never had a soft landing when credit is tightening and yields are going up.  In fact, all three soft landings saw lending remain very stable.  We rarely ever see credit tightening before a recession.  It almost always in response to a recession.  It seems this recession is extremely front loaded and wound up.   We’ve never had an everything bubble and we’ve never had interest rates increase so rapidly.  In every recession there’s always a spark that sets it off.  Thought the banks were the spark but the fed was ready for that.  When that spark finally ignites this could be a very bad recession.  Recessions are a normal part of the business cycle.  They clean out the froth so new froth can form.  We haven’t cleaned out the froth so where is the growth going to come from?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 08:34:07'] We've crossed major hurdles in the spy and the Q's. I wouldn't be looking for any more long term downside.I personally believe we're seeing the beginning of a bull market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 07:14:35'] At this point "room" has nothing to do with. We are all speculating on how strong the tech growth will be for the next years. Maybe there will be an "wake up" moment that shows that the forecasted growth is wrong. Better wait for that moment and not fight the trend I the meantime
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 11:40:24'] Tech stocks are absolutely not overbought in general, just nvidia. Google,Amazon, Microsoft etc. are all trading reasonably close to fair value
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 12:26:46'] Brother, i said the same thing with Nvda at 290. It ran from 143 to 290 without stop, aint no way this is sustainable. Got 5k in short/mid term puts w a strike of 290. 3 days later was earnings.... the rest is history 🫡😔
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 19:06:22'] Here's what I learned. Stop trying counter momentum. Don't buy puts. Buy Calls on the next dip. The market will stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 07:06:37'] Why are you buying weeklies?  If you think tech is overbought, buy puts 3-6 months out. Or go back to WSB where you can discuss gambling.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 05:46:57'] If too many people buy too many puts, their sellers will find a way to push the underlying stock even higher.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 07:17:51'] If you do this, please post the loss porn lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 08:16:19'] Most of that 40% was funds, which means long holds.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 08:55:57'] I’m kinda thinking this rally has been mostly institutional & hedge funds over buying so when all the news stations start announcing a new bull market beginning bringing back retail traders they can start heavily selling off portions of their positions while opening short positions as market goes oversold. Personally I’ll stick wit buying puts or calls ATM or close to it to be safe before taking big risk in OTM. When I see all the news screaming bull market, I think that’s when I’ll go for a big risk on outs for a big sell off. Who knows I’ll probably lose everything tho lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:59:24'] I suggest long dated puts to capture a correction when it comes
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:59:55'] apple says something AI and we'll probably keep mooning
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 13:34:15'] QQQ still has 20-30% more to go up this year
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 07:48:33'] I can’t disagree with logic or the math. I still see the nasdaq running up QQQ to 370 minimum. Then July 1 happens and things turn moderately south to September. October is when we really start to feel the effects of 10 years of zero interest rates followed by the largest hike in 40 years…then wobble wobble epic crash November / December…who knows after that…that’s the cadence that I’m investing in
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 05:05:03'] I'm short TQQQ, so I'm expecting a drop this upcoming week. But this market has been crazy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 07:12:33'] A.I. is going to be a game changer. Could be rocky over the short term as companies utilize it but there will be winners - big winners. I would stay away from funds and look for specific long term companies with a healthy balance sheet/income statement.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 07:07:41'] Might be true before Friday. Debt ceiling crisis resolved brings a new age of optimism. WWDC is next week with some much anticipated announcements. It’ll drive tech stocks even higher.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 07:52:32'] Bought sqqq on Thursday. Was relieved to see qqq held down while spy still moved up to similar liquidity levels
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 08:58:59'] Wait until fomc meeting.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 08:59:26'] Next week’s meetings will be interesting to say the least.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:09:06'] This was me last week after earnings, costly mistake. I just been scalping spy calls to make my money back
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:11:16'] Using RSI as a standalone indicator to take a trade is not a good idea. Strong trends will remain in overbought conditions longer than you can remain solvent.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:26:37'] I wouldn't do this as the market is on 🔥. The Jobs report was good, and Cpi last month was down. Last time, qqq had a big run. I got weekly puts and regretted it as it kept the uptrend and then ended sideways.I am planning to add to my puts next week on qqq and spy as I do see tech overbought, but my expiration date is the end of September and calls for the end of August. Reason is earnings for tech, and I believe they will continue to do well after. For September, historically, the market is red, and I think this plus consolidation from profits over the summer will occur. It also allows me to sell my puts without getting messed up by decay if I don't see this happening while also allowing me to sell my puts in the event something causes a downturn this summer. I also like to hedge by buying calls, so most of my plays are in puts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 10:08:08'] I agree, but that's why I'm selling my positions and writing covered calls out of money.  No way i short it right now.  Yes, too high, but no reason to go down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 10:47:39'] I think tech still has a lot of room on the upside, so be careful betting against it. We hit an inflection point due to rapidly decreasing costs of running these businesses after mass layoffs and tuning the business for efficiency. Then throw in the fact that AI just had its iPhone moment which is driving both investor mania and allowing business to further reduce populating costs. While everyone was sitting around worrying about inflation, tech has shown once again that it’s deflationary and can outpace through innovation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 11:10:00'] Why in the hell the 9th? How about December to give it time to work. Don't be greedy and don't try to be a hero.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 11:37:50'] I wouldn’t buy tech puts when aapl’s dev conference is all of next week.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 13:03:07'] 9th is tough unless you’re already holding. Elliott shows small correction possible. OI starting to move away from bullish but not quite bearish yet. I think there’s a lot of concern about the amount of liquidity about to leave the market. In regard to any of the NASDAQ100 ETFs I think were in an inflection point where you might see a small pull back before continuing waaaay up to wave 3 or things will go south quick. I’m not thrilled about the short positions I’m holding through the 16th.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 13:04:00'] I’ve been selling 0DTE QQQ puts for about a month. I think there’s still some juice left to squeeze.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 13:51:11'] Longer dated I’d be fine with (60 days+). Right now we’re at august of 22 levels. Essentially flat since the fed started raising rates. I agree things looked topped out but I’m also not aggressively shorting what’s led us up the past few weeks. If we continue higher tech will continue to lead which means qqq will continue to explore higher pricing. I’m also still seeing a lot of bullish option activity on the big names so I think we continue to explore this price range. I don’t think there’s much more upside left here but I don’t think we’re gonna immediately reverse either. Especially since we started to see other sectors support this rally last week.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 14:13:03'] i think it still has some steam as the debt ceiling fiasco just passed and its literally a blank check for the biden administration to borrow as much money as they want until 2025
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 14:31:10'] You're rationally thinking over a subject that has no rationality - who is to say the markets are overbought?  An indicator?  Thats wrong more times than its right?  The real question is, are people still trying to add these tech stocks to their portfolios @ all costs?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 14:40:25'] These stocks had a bad 2022 and are merely catching up. They didn‘t even reach their ATH. There is plenty of room to run.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 15:44:01'] Why not just sell short NVDA or QQQ? It’s more capital efficient and you won’t need to short in blocks of 100 shares nor have to fork over extrinsic for it. Puts seem suboptimal.  You could sell short like 10 shares of each… call it a day. Before anyone says “but unlimited losses”, tell me what a realistic rip on QQQ could even be in a day or two before you close out? The liquidity is great. No squeeze potential here. NVDA wise if it goes up 20% yeah you’d lose $1k (100$ x 10 shares) but you’d also probably lose that on extrinsic decay shorting, and ultimately expose yourself to 100 shares
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 15:58:59'] People are kicking themselves after missing the bottom last year. Chatgpt lit a flame, like Netscape navigator in 1993. I’d say this is more like dot com 1993 than dot com 2000

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 16:35:53'] Market keeps going up throughout the debt ceiling saga, and that's irrational, so now that everything is OK and no immediate problems looming, it should continue to be irrational and drop like a boulder
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 17:42:29'] I’ve thought this for awhile and took out a large short that cost me dearly, I finally did give up Friday tho so I’d say next week looks promising for a drop lol

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 21:24:37'] Just because QQQ went up isn’t the only reason to buy puts. Market is in uptrend semis that have under performed the market for a while know are breaking out, that will likely drive QQQ higher. Whatever you decide - best of  luck.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 03:02:18'] Yes, because it's only trending up from here on out. Your RSI's gonna see the line going up its ass.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 03:32:05'] Betting against stocks “because they went up a lot” couldn’t possibly go wrongGod speed, OP
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 05:27:13'] Your first mistake is thinking that any part of the recent run up, or the stock market in general, is rational.  Once you start thinking irrationally, just go long on a company valued at a trillion dollars, with $30 billion in annual revenue such as Nvidia.  Then just sit back and wait for retirement.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 07:39:06'] Do you realize how many people have gotten burned shorting tech as of late? Trade with wind at your back. The time to short tech was late 2021…. You know when Tesla/ Amazon went on to lose 50-70% of their value. As the indexes were falling is the time to do this. Now the indexes are rising. Nasdaq, SPY, DIA etc…. And you want to short now via puts? This is not how it works. Wait for next reset to do this. This is the time to wait for pullback on tech and then go long I.e. buy calls.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 09:33:04'] The most obvious play almost never works. The pain trade is higher still.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 04:35:39'] RSI is not an overbought/oversold indicator
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 15:45:03'] Market has been consolidating for months, probably more energy behind this. I wouldn't be looking for shorts until it's looking like it's rolling over. Buyers are in control on all time frames now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 06:37:08'] Thought this 3 weeks ago so started selling calls. Still aiming for a 10% profit but it could have been 20-30% if I just held.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 09:27:38'] It could lose steam by consolidating at current levels and then your short-dated put options, purchased with high IV, would expire worthless.Bad idea IMO based on the thesis as expressed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 11:21:43'] Much smarter to do otm bear call spreads than buying puts. Rsi can come down with flat market movement, doesn't have to drop
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 11:22:17'] I wouldn't buy puts. There is limited upside, agreed. But that doesn't mean the market will go down
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 12:01:09'] Honestly I think you’ll have more luck selling call credit spreads.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 12:03:54'] In the technicals, the probabilities are more for late June or early July for when the nasdaq really rolls over. You want to ease into these positions. Not go in all at once. PSA: This is not financial advice and no one actually knows what's going to happen.

If the market tanks you crush on the positive vega and negative delta of the position and then you can just roll the short put out.

Buying one pt itm and selling 1pt out generally gives you a 1:1 r/r Just my 2 cents. Easy to get burned on a directional bet even if your correct. Really consider buying vertical spreads instead of straight up puts... Think about you Greeks and theta. Pays less but you can control risk much better.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 15:48:49'] I’ve been getting burned on this for weeks. Not only is tech over bought, it’s also under performing. The technicals have been confusing for weeks. Big money is likely doing a major redistro. I’d say buy a couple contracts as opposed to going big. They’ve been dragging this distribution out for a while. When it falls it will fall hard and fast. You’ll make money, but it may not be this week.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 16:03:30'] Just don't buy puts
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 20:32:07'] The problem with RSI is that it signals overbought (or oversold) at roughly the same time regardless of whether the stock continues trending forever or reverses soon after.  You would get similar results by just setting a timer after a new trend begins and believing that the stock is oversold when the timer goes off.  Momentum is a difficult thing to forecast.  You know it has run out when it happens, but you can't really predict when a trend will reverse course.  Best to stick with the prevailing trend and be ready to reverse as soon as that thesis is invalidated.   Or just stay out and wait for a reversal.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 22:45:23'] Buy and hold. Don’t put too much thought into it. I buy and sell otm weekly CC’s on qqq. Safe and steady investment.

POST_TEXT: b'## Market View\n\n**Last Week **SPY was higher by about 5.9% last week and has now bounced about 12% from the 2022 lows (made in mid October.) It is about 17% away from its all-time closing highs (Dec 21).\n\nThe big move higher last week came after a tamer-than-expected CPI print that has market participants thinking the Fed is now done with its 75 basis point hikes.\n\nThe 5.9% was obviously alot more than the 2.6% move options were pricing. But once again, because the move was to the upside, combined with most of the big cap earnings, the election, the FOMC decision, and CPI now behind us, vol continues to move lower. The VIX is now 22.5. Down from 34 in October. That declining vol has not been a reaction to options overpricing moves over the past month. In fact, the opposite has been true. What it is a sign of is worries of a crash, or continued move lower in the market, whether it be FOMC, Earnings, Election, or inflation data-driven, is now less of a likelihood in the near term. In '

In an environment where inflation is crushing retailers, and they have razor thin margins to begin with on the retail side (half or so from memberships), that’s going to be an interesting call.  Consumer discretionary which looked to be a safe haven just got whacked, and then still being at a 30 forward PE is a bit nuts to me.  Wouldn’t be surprised to see this go to the mid 200s.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi everyone, I've had Nvidia (108 shares) since January 4th 2016 for a cost basis of about $7,50/share (bought AMZN at the same time too, these were the first stocks I ever bought). These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo. Strategy suggestions welcome"
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:14:49'] Don't be like me. I sold covered calls twice on NVDA. Once on the runup from metaverse. Lost out on doubling my gains from 30k to 60k. Second time I sold one 3 months ago and nvda rallied from my 300 purchase price to 380. I'll sell cover calls on stuff. But that's the last time I sell ccs on NVDA. Sat out on 30-40k of gains for a measly $800 I got from selling the CCs.Edit: Not double the gains. Double the amount in my account from 30 to 60k.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:32:03'] you could sell the NVDA stock to a round lot (down to 100 shares) and use that capital to do what you're looking to do. this would still give you the option of selling CCs as wellsince you're not going to play capital gains tax on the sale, there's no real downside to just selling stock here if you want to diversify more  FWIW, selling 8 shares would cover your entire cost basis for the position PLUS secured profit of around 300% if you've purchased at a $7.50 average.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:09:36'] Just sell some to reduce the size down to your desired weight. No need to get unnecessarily fancy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:56:22'] I understand wanting to diversify. Can't blame you with Nvidia's current price either but If you have a longer term view I wouldn't completely liquidate. However, with Amazon I would much rather reduce it to a very small position due to the consistent negative quarters.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:39:51'] If you want to diversify, just sell most of it. It's a tax free account so there are no capital gains taxes to worry about. I wouldn't bother with CCs in your situation. There is a very real chance that NVDA corrects. How would that make you feel?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 23:04:57'] Selling $30 OTM calls every two weeks would net $480 in premium ($420 strike right now). That seems like a very agreeable price to me even in the event of a run up. You’re free to do whatever you want, including selling now. But that’s a really REALLY nice OTM to premium ratio to me.Weekly would be about $240. This next week is a day short, so premiums closed Friday at $200. Either 1 week or 2 weeks would work

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:33:59'] $20 out might not pay much....especially a week or 2 out.   It's a decent strategy if you truly want to sell, but if there's a runup, it's painful to watch on the sidelines as your contract becomes worthless and the shares you "kind of own" are worth a thousand more than they were 3 days ago and you can't cash in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:37:33'] Don’t waste your energy on the NVDA CC.  Make your decision to hold it for the price you want or have a stop loss.  At most, I’d do June 16 call 410 if you want to squeeze that $1000 premium right now.  Don’t cloud your judgment on your best trade ever.  Hold it or sell it and don’t regret it.  Context.  I crushed with AAPL in early 2000s. Average cost in <$10 dollar range.   In 2019, sold over 1000 shares for help with down payment on vacation home.  AAPL has gone up a lot since then.  So has that property and never regretted decision.  Currently have 1800 shares from remaining 2000 I had.  My goal was to sell off 500 and diversify.  I’ve done that with 200.  The other 300 are in CC that shot past my CC on this last run from $130 up to 170s.  I don’t think about any of the other moves, but these CC for squeezing that last bit of gain before diversifying has tied me up while I’d rather make other buys with that money on my time frame and clear mind.  Wasn’t worth it.  Maybe for you it’s worth it but not me.

This is too good of an opportunity to set a battle line for the 2024 election. Neither party will let that chance pass them by.After the debt ceiling deal gets signed, the market may be happy for a few weeks. Then it will wake up to the mofo big liquidity drain and Tbill supply dumping on the bond market from Treasury as it fills the coffers so it can pay bills again.

Single-leg BUYERs (who don\'t rely too much on TA/price-action or indicators but are more based on business hypotheses: e.g."I bet NVIDIA will do well over the next few months because of the recent interest in AI and the need for chips")\n\n\\#5 is mainly me. For this style of trading I feel it\'s important to know your prediction hit rate so that you can make sure you take on option trades that have an appropriate level of risk:reward given your hit-rate.  Curious about others who trade in that #5 style and your approach to options trading'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 00:46:50'] OP, good post - makes a change from the "I sold my first CC, now its ITM - what should I do?".You are a "fundamentals" trader. You enter a position based on the companies fundamentals. This is generally not an options scenario - but a bullish (or bearish) position on the underlying, and normally used by investors, cos its a medium to long term strategy. Good for you, if you can make this work with options.I'm a #4 trader - i trade calenders, butterflies etc. I know nothing about fundamentals. I trade purely theta and vega. I trade for a living, so I guess its working pretty well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 06:59:47'] I was a number 5, but after having my ass handed to me a few times I've started to learn TA.So now I rely on a combination of sentiment and TA.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 07:30:22'] I'm a combination of #3 and #5. The largest problem with being an option trader using fundamentals is the same issue with trading stocks on fundamentals: your thesis may be accurate, but the market doesn't price it in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 04:06:11'] I’m going to say in my current state #5.. the perfect example you used for NVIDIA is how I made a lot of money back that I lost in this process of learning about options trading. $150 call to $2200 and that was me being safe. I checked what I could’ve made with the FOMO devil on my shoulders voice asking questions about what it was at later on before the market closed, I had realized that I could’ve made a whopping $4650 so $4500 profit on it 🤣 I’m working on not listening to this voice anymore lol it was just hard not to be curious about it when your seeing and hearing this stock price soar lol but it’s not that bad to check out prices on the positions that you have sold already so you can decide if you want to jump back in and buy it again to sell it for a little more profit. *Robinhood’s day trade settings being turned on makes it so I can hop in and out on my options but instant cash deposit or cash. What I sold earlier today or technically yesterday, I already see that it has been added to my buying power. So if you can keep up with current market trends and events etc. The faster you can make your guesstimate to buy a single leg call or put out of the money and then sell it in the money, then you and I will profit off news if it isn’t already in circulation for a while.I’ve also gambled on buying some before earnings calls and this method has worked for me the best in getting the highest return on investments. But I have a ways to go, I just learned the Greeks and it’s a great tool for investing and it’ll help me not jump into the habit of buying a lot of options. Hopefully I was able to shed some light on your questions and didn’t ramble too much hahaha
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 09:09:39'] I think your categories are orthogonal, meaning, it's possible to use TA **and** trade Iron Condors. They aren't mutually exclusive.You either use TA or you don't. You either use fundamentals or you don't. That's really all the categories you need, a 2x2 grid. Your "business hypothesis" is just a form of fundamentals analysis.Price action is an interesting one. I think it's cart before the horse. If you trade options **for** price action, then obviously you are going to use price action. But the only other alternative would be trading options for insurance (hedging). So everyone who is not purely hedging is using price action, no matter where they land in the 2x2 grid. You are using price action too, whether you realize it or not.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 23:40:02'] If you're profitable then I wouldn't worry so much about how others trade. I've found that I'm too easily influenced by others opinions which is why I don't use StockTwits anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 01:03:09'] I dabble a bit across the board, but #3 Option Selling has been by far my most consistent strat. I'm very proud of myself using CCs to lower my cost basis of SOFI from about $20 to about $5.75. Now those shares are 'ITM' and I continue to sell CCs more aggressively to either make more money, or get called.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 05:36:40'] 5 is dangerous since if you’re ever correct it might lead to the believe that you were correct because of your thesis, which doesn’t have to be true. I find this approach leads to a bias that you’re outsmarting the market, which I don’t think anyone can do. 2 all the way. Price action tells it all for me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 06:13:58'] So if you are #5 and buying options based on fundamentals - I am assuming you must be buying LEAPS (options way, way out in time)?  Because fundamentals will take time to play out.  I also do this on a limited basis - but NOT around hot, already moving stocks.  If you are buying what is HOT in the news, planning on the news driving the market further in a given direction - In trading circles I run in (and not trying be offensive here), we call that the "Bigger Fool" theory.  You are buying something news driven - in the direction of the news and then hoping that someone that is more news driven than you will pay you more for it.  Sometimes that can and will happen - but sometimes you are the one left holding the bag when the bubble pops and when that happens, it will hurt a LOT.  Also - keep in mind that IF you are buying the single call/put AFTER news has started the underlying on a big move - the options you are buying in that direction are already HUGELY inflated by that news, so you not only have the risk that the underlying's move could stop at any time, but even if the run does not stop, you are likely WAY overpaying for that option you are buying.  I am not saying you won't have some winners here - but in my 30+ years of trading and teaching others to trade, I would say this would be by far one of the toughest ways to try to produce sustainable returns - there is just too much working against you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 05:35:54'] Well i am a mix of 2 and 4
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 07:50:40'] If you are doing fundamental analysis on the underlying, how does that help you trade options?  Let’s say your analysis suggests that NVDA has a 20% chance to rise to 400 in the next 3 months.  If the options are pricing that at 25% you could be right and still lose money (on average).
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 09:43:55'] They key in my mind is having a strategy given your outlook and the state of the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 12:53:57'] I mean in crypto at least there is #6 where I don't watch the price nor the fundamentals, nor the TA, but just OI rates and some additional Bollinger bands for confirmation. You just put your money in where the big boys put their money in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 13:14:16'] I’m a single leg buyer but use technical indicators to trade.  I look at volume and like to trade earnings.

POST_TEXT: b'I am thinking of getting a few NVDA puts @ $150 3/17 2023. Of course NVDA remains a great stock long-term, but short-term there appears to be much more downside potential. With the Arm deal falling through in February, only negative triggers seem to remain to reinforce the current downtrend: worsening macroeconomic conditions, FED rate hikes, potential stock dilution later this year, ETH switching to proof-of-stake which may hit GPU demand, slowing consumer demand for GPUs... The stock has been hitting the key $210 support level multiple times this year already, and its valuation is still extremely high. Its price-to-sales ratio stands at 20, still much higher than its pre-pandemic peak of 15 and the industry average (AMD P/S is 7 for instance). Same is true for its P/E ratio of 56.  Anything I am missing/your thoughts?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-19 07:49:46'] Be aware of its weighting in indexes and etfs. A rising tide lifts all boats.

Earnings May25th as well.I currently have a tiny long position, but yes I would look at shorts above 250.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-19 09:58:37'] It's already dropped from $345 to $220 in the past 6 months. Sure, dropping further is possible, but I have to imagine that at some point it will bottom out. Buying a put on a stock that's already dropped almost 40% seems like the wrong move. The market says that those 3/17 2023 $150 strikes only have a 15% chance of expiring ITM. Basically, few people are expecting that big of a correction.

Everything has a semiconductor in it. So hard to tell if semis will break away from the tech sell-off.$NVDA is also the most expensive semi name (if using multiples), with $INTC being one of the cheapest. So $NVDA has more room to drop.It's a monster of a company, but sometimes the market doesn't care.

Cause you should've sold at least half your contracts at 60% profit easily.

I'm assuming I'm SoL\n\nEdit: This sub rocks; love the advice on how to play it."
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-22 04:50:47'] How to understand what happens on stock splits.  From the wiki here at r/options.  Written up by u/PapaCharlie9  Option Adjustments  https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq#wiki_option_adjustments.3A_splits.2C_mergers.2C_special_dividends.2C_and_more
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:07:02'] The strike prices will be adjusted according through the split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:54:54'] As others have already pointed out, especially /u/TheoHornsby nicely detailed post, a traditional split is not so bad, it's those reverse or merger that causes headaches. I think TLRY had one(?) that ended up something like one contract is 87 shares and every symbol had a number after it. TLRY1, TLRY2, TLRY3 because of the wacky-ness.And those adjusted odd number shares are less liquid than some nicely rounded numbers. I see that it is 4-1 split, so the $600 -> $150 and the $700 -> $175 and one contract will become 4, or 2 -> 8, etc...Plus I also see that the stock price is rising after the announcement, which means more $$ on your calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 09:20:24'] >I'm assuming I'm SoLFar from it. You will be controlling 4x the amount of shares, each at 1/4 the price. So a 600c will become 150c contract for 400 shares. The price should reflect exactly how the stock moves as normal. Splits are usually a bullish indicator as there will be increased liquidity and people will be rushing to buy shares at the lower, more attractive price. Note that the value of each share is completely unchanged. NVDA's market cap will not change based on the split price alone.You're best to hold these as long as you can, and congratulations. If you have some that are expiring soon it would be wise to take profits. The vote for the split is June 3. It will almost certainly pass and then the stock will split after. I'm not sure the timeline that these things normally go through. I think other splits have typically happened a couple months after the announcement.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:17:45'] You're not SOL. Options contracts are affected by split. If you hold a 100 share contract across the split horizon, in this case it will be worth 400 shares afterwards. Any calls you have beyond August at the moment will see this effect on the same day as the split occurs. The premiums will be adjusted to reflect the per share basis, but the total value of the contract will be the same.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:34:42'] Whole Splits and OptionsA whole stock split results in a proportional increase in the number of contracts and a proportional decrease in the strike price.For example, if you own one $50 strike price call on a stock that declares a 5-for-1 stock split, after the split you would own 5 call options with a $10 strike price (1x50 = 5x10).Fractional Stock SplitsOption adjustments are handled differently for uneven splits such as 3 for 2 or 5 for 2. A trader cannot hold a fractional option contract which would be the result if one contract was adjusted in a 3-for-2 ratio. Therefore, the number of shares is increased from the standard 100 shares by the split ratio.For example, one call option with a $60 strike price would become one call for 150 shares with a $40 strike price after a 3-for-2 split (100x60 = 150x40).
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:07:14'] Sol? Pretty sure its the opposite . I think luck is shitting out of the sky on you
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 14:48:30'] This is what I understandThe stock price is at 700If theres a stock split, then just divide the price of it (in this case it's i think 4:1)700/4 = 175The option does the SAME thing.. your strike price becomes 175 and your options multiply by 4.. so if you hold 1 call (each call represents 100 shares), then youll be holding 4 calls @ 175 strike price
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 21:52:47'] I think most of the replies have been accurate as to the post split effect. Note that either the morning of the split or the Sunday prior, you may see your option value quadruple as the brokers update the record keeping. Don’t get too excited, it will get corrected by the end of Monday ( first trading day post split). Btw congrats on the trade. I missed out. I sold out of my 5/28 600c last week and lost out on the massive run up this week.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 08:24:26'] You can hold your calls, but note that liquidity for those specific adjusted strike prices will significantly decrease over time as traders move toward the new non-adjusted equivalent strike. This may lower the price you can actually sell your calls for, compared to the quoted book price.I suggest closing your options as soon as the split occurs and opening an equivalent position in the new strikes available. This will maintain your current position while minimizing your exposure to low liquidity.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:22:30'] The strikes and breakevens of your contracts will adjust accordingly. Just like the historic charts for the stock will adjust to the post split values. I dont know the exact values but say for example its a 4 for 1 split, your 600 calls would turn into 150 calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 07:44:57'] If you had 100 calls at 100 strike and the stock does a 2 to 1 split then you end up with 200 calls at 50 strike

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 22:17:32'] Not sure if this has been mentioned already, but don't forget the reorganization fee that some brokers charge when a split happens.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 14:28:38'] From watching the past couple of stock splits seems like there will be a run-up prior to the split, but then GTFO a couple of days ahead of the actual split.  Atleast that's how AAPL and TSLA behaves with their last splits.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 11:21:03'] Options will be adjusted so each contact will be 25 shares (instead of 100). Imo I’d sell the position and move to the new options with the same strike/date as their can be liquidity issues with adj. options.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 19:29:54'] Id imagine the strike prices goes down by a factor of 4, since it's a 4:1 split.So a 600 strike option goes down to 150, a 700 strike option goes to 175, and so forth.Funny how some companies never split (e.g. AMZN), and some continue to split, split, split, etc (AAPL).  I kind of prefer the non-split variety.  What I fear with all the splitting is if the stock declines...it's appears (although I don't technically know) that it's harder for it to climb back up.According to [Barchart.com](https://Barchart.com), there are 483 companies with more than 1B outstanding shares.  Some of the more famous ones with high outstanding shares:AAPL = 16.6BGE = 8.7BBAC = 8.5BMSFT = 7.5BT = 7.1BPFE = 5.6BKO = 4.3BF = 4BMS = 1.8BNKE = 1.5B&#x200B;It's interesting that out of the top 20 companies sorted by outstanding shares, I've heard of one.  They are all strange foreign companies with ADRs, many with S.A. at the end of the name.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 20:38:00'] They'll be adjusted.Fundamentally nothing changes. Sometimes though the price gets bid up, because it "seems cheaper".Shits going on with China and bcorn and this might effect Nvidia (I have no idea, I don't know anything about Nvidia and if they selling mining hardware and how that effects them, just saw someone mentioned that in some chat)

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 14:03:45'] You should check ur broker's rules. Most brokers for even positive splits like this will split ur x1 600c into x4 150c.Otherwise for fractional splits 4:3 or reverese splits you get irregular options that dry up in volume. They will only adjust the strike price but will not represent 100 shares (total contracts you own won't change).
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 12:11:33'] What is sol
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-21 19:04:48'] After the split your calls will have a letter after them that the only difference. After the split just add the number of shares that they split if it’s 5-1 you add the 5 shares. A 600c the stock is trading for $120 so you’re at the money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-25 20:10:48'] Market makers make the markets. They are the liquidity providers. That’s literally their job, as the title would imply. They make money by selling above their theoretical value and buying below it, and hedging their risk, over and over again. You may think they get wrecked on something like selling a call for $9 that is now worth $80, but they hedge their risk by purchasing shares. In reality, if they sold the call for $9 when they thought it was worth $8.50 and hedged it and can buy it back now for $80 but it’s worth $81, they very well may have made money. Point being, don’t assume that the market makers have bad risk management like 99% of reddit and trade naked options. They have extremely sophisticated systems that allow them to extract a lot of money off of retail investors.

Someone somewhere opened a trade with a short call and is the counterparty to the long call in your example.  They ended up losing on this leg, but we don't know if this was part of a call debit spread in which they ended up making money for the trader even if this leg lost money.Yes, someone somewhere shorted calls on the stock and lost a lot of money, but we cannot tell their reasoning, size of their account, prior performance, etc.  There are some who lost big and if they took too much risk then they have learned the valuable lesson of trading options . . .See this for more in MMs - [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp)

A bunch of stocks have huge moves, a bunch of premium sellers get wiped out. The next batch has muted moves, the premium sellers still standing do well. Recency bias is a large pit, especially for traders just moving past novice stage. Be careful.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-22 08:26:48'] Daytrading is your hedge against external events. You're going flat by EOD in order to not hold overnight risk and starting again the next day.Paying a premium to hedge intraday is not worth it to hedge against the occasional 2.5 SD move. Your true hedge while daytrading is position size.

You get IV crushed either way, and doubly so if you buy both directions at once.I would suggest either selling a credit spread, so falling IV is in your favor, or if you're really day trading, look for an entry at the opening bell and play the movement that happens after that.

With the explosion of AI and NVDAs 80% market share for AI processors, they have to potential to beat earnings and shoot even higher.

Hard to tell really how many AI servers are being constructed. \n\nLast time I asked about earnin predictions here though you guys convinced me to not get AAPL cals because it wouldnt rise high enough, which it did and could have made 300% returns.

I feel that anyone who teaches you how to do that would be doing you harm. Instead, you should be learning how parachutes work, then go for a few rounds with experts, before you finally understand how it works and do it yourself.Likewise, I feel that teaching you how to do 1 trade without teaching you about the risks, is doing you more harm than anything.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 09:42:43'] Its already at ATH. There has not been any real pull back since the stock run up to $820 on a stock split news. I mean it can definitely still go up, but to be honest there is not much upside potential in this for short term. So dont be surprised even if it trades sideways with great earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-18 02:53:24'] Be very careful with earnings and options. It's almost never worth to hold them through earnings because IV drops so fast. Unless it's a major double-digit move, you're not going to make much money from the underlying price action itself, and even then the option prices will change fast and you'll lose some on the bid spread when trying to sell it back.A better strategy is to sell before earnings, either options you bought before the IV climb or writing options that you can later buyback cheap. Iron condors can help mitigate risk if you can estimate the range the stock will stay between.

Do you mean you want to sell 45 OTM calls?Or do you mean deep ITM calls, like with a strike price of $100? That would make sense in the context of your question ... Sell those, collect the immediate premium which would be substantial.Before you do that, you should find out if your broker will let you, since the underlying was bought on margin Then think about your expectations for the underlying ...

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 17:58:37'] Sounds like you want to sell 45 covered calls against your position of 4500 shares of the equity you own.  Very common practice.  Though a 200 call is not gonna get you much downside protection.  If you are trying to take advantage of the slightly higher premium from the upcoming earnings.  Say selling 45 180 Calls for around $2.  Capture 9k of premium.  This would basically put you in the position of selling all your shares at $182 or if it drops.  It will take your cost to $148.  No free lunches in this game.  There is always a give and take.  You get the premium but your gains is limited to 182, on the flip side you may lower the cost of the per share by $2 if NVDA moves down…

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 12:35:42'] “To understand what is beta-slippage, imagine a very volatile asset that goes up 25% one day and down 20% the day after. A perfect double leveraged ETF goes up 50% the first day and down 40% the second day. On the close of the second day, the underlying asset is back to its initial price”This means that while your gains may go up a lot because of the leverage they also will go down just as quickly. Factor in theta as well and then suddenly you have a large percentage of potential gain whisked away through both. But that doesn’t factor in current market sentiment. And just a reminder just because a stock hit its 52 week low doesn’t mean it won’t go lower
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 14:35:17'] It's goes up unless it goes down. Hope this helps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 14:45:54'] Leveraged funds exaggerate tends.  For example, if you think semis are going up 3 days in a row, you come out way ahead as opposed to buying SMH.If you’re in a market where we’re choppy, you’re better off being in SMH. Do you think we’re going to streak in one direction or another?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 15:56:08'] Better to buy calls on chip co or a etf. Soxl has negative drag so I would only play it to either a) buy dip and flip or b) buy and hold when it starts going to the upper right side of the chart. Either way better have a firm grasp on price action to play with leverage directionally
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 21:38:58'] In a bear market, if we go sideways with deep red days, this is eventually going to get so low they will reverse split it. Just be prepared for that to be a possibility.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 08:43:55'] Been bag holding 300 shares of SOXL (average basis $30) for months now.  The good news is that there is always some premium to be made off calls.  I've been selling calls far below my basis basically the entire time with the expectation that if they go ITM I just roll them up and out.  In retrospect I would have rather tied up the cash in something else however if I just continue my current strategy I'll most likely get back to my cost basis eventually while having made premium back all along.  I'll continue this strategy with what I have already invested but I won't invest more.  This represents less than 10% wheeling portfolio.Just be careful... there's no end in sight currently for the bear market and SOXL dropping 50%+ more isn't unlikely at all.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 03:52:17'] The negative carry on this is “priced in” to the call prices, so 3x the 5% call on SOXX will be worth more than the 15% upside call on SOXL. Options on leveraged products are tricky beasts and the MMs pricing them have some sophisticated models to price the carry reasonably and take much wider spreads to account for greater path dependency in the payoff, so you should expect to lose on transaction costs here more than e.g trading SMH, and unless you want to express an opinion on the path dependency rather than the level you’d be better off trading SMH.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-25 05:15:50'] The decay amplifies in volatile markets and choppy sideways markets, where there is a lot of up & down days without much change to the underlying stock/sector.For example, if the underlying sector starts at $100, goes up 25% to $125 day 1, and down 20% back to $100 day 2. The 3x etf (if also starting at$100) would go up 75% day 1 to $175, and down 60% to $70 day 2. In this example, the underlying is flat, but your leveraged etf is down 30%. The longer you hold, the more likely you'll get hit by this decay.However, in a bull market, when returns are same direction most of the time, the return in the leveraged etf will amplify and be more than 3x return.I would suggest either waiting until a bull market trend arises before doing ccs on it. Or, if there is also an inverse etf, do CCs on both simultaneously. I do this with TQQQ and SQQQ weekly, and then rebalance every week, and it seems to be working pretty well.Good luck.

Thanks for all of your advice. Wanted to keep my gains instead of gambling it all on nvidia earnings. For better or for worse. '
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 18:01:22'] Since you mentioned that you are studying tastytrade material...Your position goes against what tastytrade preaches.  They recommend **selling** premium during high IV (like right before earnings - literally, the day before ER).  Don't buy premium unless there's a good reason to do so...and when you are buying... try to buy when IV is low.On the tastyworks platform, your position has a 37% POP (probability of profit) and a 42% P50 (probability of capturing 50% of max profit).  If I didn't look this up, I would have suggested that you made a bet that's slightly less than 50/50 probability of a win.If you want to play the earnings the /r/wallstreetbets YOLO way, keep your position as it is (or add to it).If you want to play the earnings the tastytrade way, you should close out your position and redeploy your capital in a way that plays the odds in your favor.  The tastytrade earnings play is essentially entering into a position by selling premium (i.e. writing a put and/or a call) the day before earnings since IV will be at its highest.  You want to write these contracts far enough outside of the expected move (16 delta or twice the expected move) so that you can close them after earnings report for a profit (or let them expire worthless - a much less preferred strategy).  Once the earnings come out, IV will decrease and you can close your position by buying back your contracts (to close out) at a cheaper price (assuming the price stays within the bounds of your assumption).  It's not a get-rich-quick strategy, it's a get rich slow strategy. When you buy a contract, there's 1 way to be right and 2 ways to be wrong.  To be right, the price needs to move in your direction **and** pass through the break even point. To be wrong, the underlying price moves in the opposite direction (or doesn't move at all) or moves in the right direction, but not by enough.  For example, you paid $10.50 for your 225 call which makes your break even price $235.50.  If the stock moves in your direction by $9 to $234, you're still down $150.  If the stock stays at 225 or moves down, you're out $1050.  When buying contracts - being right can pay out big time.When you write (sell) ATM/OTM contracts, there are 2 ways to be right and 1 way to be wrong.  If the stock moves away from you, past your break even - you're wrong.  If it doesn't move away enough or doesn't move at all, it makes you right.  If it moves in your favorable direction, it makes you right.  When selling contracts, being wrong can cost you big time - but you can go with risk-defined positions to cap your losses.  More risk = more reward.  Less risk = less reward.Theta = rate of time decay (currently at -45...losing $0.45 per day; negative because it's working against you since you hold a long position).  Theta tends to increase logarithmically as the contract expiration date approaches.Delta = how much the contract price will change based on changes to the underlying stock price (currently  57.55 - which means the price of the option will adjust by $0.58 for each $1 move of the underlying stock)If I were you, I'd get out of that position when the market opens up.  If you're lucky, you might be able to get out at a scratch if the opening price is favorable and since IV will continue to increase (which increases extrinsic value of all options) up until the earnings report.  I say this because I'm not a fan of 50/50 (or less) bets.
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 10:50:11'] You should probably do more research into option before buying 1000 dollar call contracts a week out. Time decay is not only going to kill you but iv contraction will make it even worse if you bought it at a high iv 
	COMMENT: ['2018-05-01 14:11:17'] When it comes to decay and IV vulnerability, you only need to pay attention to the extrinsic part of the price.  That's the most you can lose to decay or IV crush.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 23:02:53'] Here's what you do:1.  Listen to everyone on here that says start with long term stocks, open a paper trading account and use that to learn options.2. When you then say *"fuck all that good advice I'm gunna trade options anyway"*, start by selling options, not buying them.  Learn basic credit put spreads, credit call spreads & iron condors.  Don't get greedy, a 4% return per week would be great.  If you try to double/triple your money fast, your $1,000 will be gone in less than a month.3. Research as much as you can about options trading, watch as many tutorials as you can about options trading.I wish I started at 20... Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 20:20:25'] There’s a million other replies here, but if you wanna dip your toes into options, just look for cheap premiums for stocks with a strong uptrend. Pfizer has been doing really well lately. Premiums are fairly cheap. BB has cheap premiums too but a little more risky. PLTR is one I generally make profit on too. You need to learn some technical analysis, follow the charts patterns, and use your brain instead of your emotions. When I started, I would write down the cost of an options premium and then track it over the next days/weeks to see if I would have ended up profitable. Once you do that for awhile, you’ll have a bit more conviction in your bets and you’ll learn to follow through with them. But everyone starts somewhere.I started with $800 in my account at the beginning of this month and I’m up to $3.5k as of today. You’ll have losses, but your losses won’t matter if your gains outweigh them.Edit: here’s what I mean by writing down (screenshotting) potential plays that I thought would work: https://imgur.com/a/46jdErHBuy-in: $2.49Sell: $10.08Kinda salty I missed it but that’s okay.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 00:30:50'] Dude, buy options, play options. With this small amount of money you need to raise it fast to make reasonable money. You need to learn to take risk in order to make money. Probably you will loose your first fund, but it will teach you. Primarily learn about the markets, read books, watch related youtube channels etc. LEARN EVERY DAY.As one famous investor said: "Take a risk to make money, play it safe to protect your money"
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 19:15:59'] Yes just buy long-term dividend stocks with drip, get the hell out of options right now. You’re young, build the passive income
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 20:29:32'] To be honest, I applaud you for starting young and for having money management in mind. The general recommendation is to risk no more than 1% of your capital per trade, because exponential recovery is needed and the more you risk per trade, the harder it is to climb back to even 100% of your initial capital, even if you fail just one trade. Perhaps you can learn more from OptionsPlay’s video on “Trading Psychology”.Having said that, the cheapest I can think of is buying calls after you have done proper research and can hold for long term.Otherwise, you can buy debit spreads which cost usually $450 - $480+ per trade. When / if the trade works out, you can then profit with $20-$50. Then slowly build up, which takes time. This is only provided that you do understand the mechanics of debit spread.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-22 13:16:06'] Jusy my 2 cents - I buy stocks and trade options(timidly). I'm 28m, new to options but have 2 mentors who have decadrs.of experience and it still terrifies me. I do very small options plays (1 or 2 contracts on stable tickers). But what I do more than that while I take my time learning is LETFs. It allows me to leverage my stock purchases but with less risk (as long as managed correctly). For example, UPRO leverages S&P500 x3. Very volatile, but im up 35% since entering my position. Similar situation to something like TECL. If your eager to leverage, maybe start here. Then, paper trade options and take your time learning. I was eager when I started and made some absolutely idiotic plays. I now watch a guy I work with who thinks he is now an options genius, and he's making even dumber plays and can't understand why he's lost more money than he's made haha. Good luck man, starting at 20 could out you at an early retirement if you listen to the people who want to help you, not the wants who want you to share your loss porn.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 22:54:16'] Every options beginner should start the same. Buy 100 shares of something you want to own long term, and sell covered calls.  If it gets called away, pick a new stock and do it again.  After a while, you can switch to selling cash covered puts using the same stock selection.  Or "the wheel" which is just selling  the cash covered puts until you are assigned to buy the shares, followed by selling covered calls until you are assigned to sell, and repeat on and on.  After you have a year or two experience, you can add credit spreads and/or iron condors (which is just two credit spreads at once).  None of this has "huge upside" you are talking about, but under most circumstances it will perform slightly better than buy and hold.  The plays with huge upside require a lot more expertise and you are just plain not ready for that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-18 19:29:16'] Easy. Don’t day trade or trade options until you understand the rules, mechanics, and risks you’re playing with. Or, do whatever and hope it works. My vote is for not day trading and not options trading.

Id look into setting up a plan and then focusing on one specific ticker, I have been constitently been trading $AAPL and $AMD since last year, the trends hold and follow according to the SPY and QQQ - easy to identify if the stocks are bullish/bearish and from there you would need to basically have entry points and exit points setup
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 02:27:42'] If you have enough consistent disposable income, then go for it. Don’t trade an amount of money that you’re gonna lose sleep over. Learn as much as you can from people that are consistently profitable.  Figure out what works best for you, whether it’s scalping or swing trading. Don’t discount trading groups too, there are plenty of (free) discord groups out there that focus on options trading. Having a community will absolutely help.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 02:37:04'] I’m no expert but I would buy a couple of shares of SPY to get started and spend no more than $ 300 total on options plays.   Unfortunately since you are a newbie you are about to make every mistake in the book.  Like buying calls that expire in a few days or 30 days instead of 3-4 months, or going long on a weekly or jumping in after the Runup. If I knew at 20 what I know now and was in your situation I would look up vertical and calendar spreads.   It’s a little difficult at first but Robinhood makes it very easy.  They will even show you graphically what you could make at expiration and before expiration.   Additionally you can try out https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/Where you can test theories before you buy and find out where you will be a few days later potentially.   Using these suggestions I was able to turn $150 in Robinhood to $3000 and that included dabbling in very small amounts of cryptos Ethereum and Doge.    But it was made last year on AAPL and TSLA.    I used calendar and vertical spreads.    RH is not my main account but one that I use to try things out that I wouldn’t really risk in my main account.  But I found that this strategy seems to work almost all of the time in up or down markets.  One thing to remember when you start low.  Capital preservation is the goal.  Home runs are few and far between.   Go for base  hits.  $100 here, $50 there etc.  Hope this helps.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 02:44:37'] Go to Wikipedia and read and practice the different options strats on a  paper account. Simultaneously, open a real account, use $50 on the first few (3) strats you understand. Put the remaining $950 on the same strats but on multiple assets/markets on paper account.The greater your practice within  multiple finacial markets and the correlations between the greater your understanding. What will prove most valuable is the amount of effort and attention to detail you put out to acquire unique understanding. This in time gives you an edge. Your edge is your profit, considering how young you are don't get overly caught up in making money. Focus on not losing more than you expect to make. Time and discipline will prove out in the end. Dont forget to have fun.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 20:15:01'] First of all, you need to recognize that 1k is not a lot of money. I understand that for someone with a student loan or just out of school it can feel like a lot but for options trading it really isnt. It is definitely possible to make money in options trading with 1k but it will be difficult, require careful selection, sound strategy and luck.   You must have cash available to cover emergencies. If this 1k is your entire savings then dont invest it or trade with it. Once you've got 1k in your emergency account and an extra 1k (change the amount depending on your needs, if you own a vehicle or a home then you will need a larger emergency reserve) then you're ready to start.   Paper trade to start. My broker doesnt offer paper trading of options so i started with just normal shares. I recommend starting with these anyway. With options, you need to learn about strikes, expiration dates, the greeks, etc; but the most important thing is to learn to read the charts. This is the same for shares or for options. Find a strategy that works for you. What works for day traders may not necessarily work for swing traders and even within those sub categories, what works for one stock or trader may not work for others. When you find a stock you like work out an entry and exit point and make the paper trade. At your entry point, make a note of where your strike price would be if you were buying an option and where your expiration date would be. Remember for a call, your strike needs to be below where you think the stock price will reach (why would someone buy the contract off of you when they could just get it at market price and save themselves the premium). This will help you learn the direction and magnitude of the movement in the underlying before you even look at the options chain.  Never look at a stock in isolation. Always see how the market it belongs to is performing and how its competitors are performing. My most successful play of the last couple of weeks was an earnings play on UAA (Under Armor). I noticed that NKE (Nike) gapped up after earnings by $20ish on June 25th and saw that UAA had earnings on August 3rd.  Looking at UAA's chart, I saw that it had been on a downtrend since the last earnings report so there was plenty of room to the upside. NKE had also been in a slight downtrend before its breakout. I was expecting a big jump at earnings up to around $23.50 (previous resistance, it was trading around $20 pre earnings I believe) and then to climb higher to $26.50 within a couple of days which was post-COVID highs, and then on higher. What actually happened was UAA closed below previous resistance so I knew the rise wouldn't be as high as I expected. I went in at close with a call for $23.50. Reasoning was, I now expected a day 2 break and then retest that resistance before climbing to $26.50. I was sick that day so didn't follow closely but looking at the daily it appears to have done that. I ended up selling just below the highs on August 10th. I then saw it bounce off of the $26.50 post-COVID highs and entered puts expecting to sell at the previous resistance of $23.50, which I expected to turn into support. It didn't and we fell through. I'm still holding these and will be selling at the 100MA unless there is another massive sell off. The reason why I think of this as one of my most successful recent plays is because I got the direction of the underlying right, the time frame right, entry and exits almost perfect and (even though I got the magnitude wrong) my strategy of buying conservative OOTM calls meant that I was able to make money on a move, even though I wasn't 100% correct.  You wont really be able to use safer strats like covered calls until you have a larger account. You can also buy options on some ETF's. The XLF ETF has been my friend of late. It follows the financial sector and has fairly cheap ATM/ITM options.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-20 20:39:33'] 1. With only $1000, you won't be able to write naked puts or covered calls because you don't have enough in your account.2. You can only trade credit or debit spreads but this is very risky for a beginner. You need a good understanding of technical analysis.3. Try a paper trading account as mentioned by other comments to get the hang of credit and debit spreads.4.

You have to accept small losses sometimes and be thankful they aren't huge. Just look at those poor kids over on WSB and you'll see what I mean. You have people losing thousands or hundreds of thousands because they aren't willing to accept small losses, and just hope things will turn around. They usually don't, then sitting on worthless options or holding onto shares way above stock price, and next thing you know, you're broke. This is a mental game, you can't be emotional trading. Know what your goal is, and what your stop is before going into a trade. Once you hit your goal, get out while you're green. Worst thing you can do is hold onto a green trade too long and watch it go red

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 05:55:48'] 1) Don't chase a pump or enter high IV positions lightly.  Compare IV with HV to see how expensive your position is to enter compared to the typical pricing.2) Learn FA, TA, or any method you like to inform your entry and exit points. 3) familiarise yourself with the Greeks, any one of these can mess up your strategy if you're not careful (volatility, time value etc.)4) do your DD, look for any impulses which could move the underlying up or down.  Maximum pain, earnings, pending m&a, macroeconomic reports etc.  Hundreds of different forces can shift your stock price so get a big picture before making that trade.5) it's perfectly fine to buy an ITM, OTM or ATM option depending on your strategy.  It's also perfectly fine to buy an option which will never go ITM (in your opinion) if there's enough open interest and volatility will make it profitable.Loads more I could say but that's a lot to chew on. Good luck.Before I forget, don't buy options in companies which have been bought out. The price is fixed and unless they renegotiate you'll hold heavy bags until expiry.Also, if a company has earnings (for example) you are better off buying options which are expiring a week or two after.  So if your price target is 30 on a 25 buck stock and your exit date is the 2nd, you can still make money if your price target isn't hit on the day.I now typically only buy options I when I can afford at least 3 contracts. This let's me stagger my exit instead of diamondhand one into the dirt.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 06:13:33'] do yourself a favor and buy stock.  Spend 700 on whatever stock you pick. Do not sell your shares to bail out your option's play if it goes sideways. This is called discipline.Take the 300 that you have left to buy an option. Draft Kings has a predictable movement and the options are moderately priced. The stock price dips every morning (usually dips to 51.20 - 51.99) . Buy the option when the stock price dips and sell it before 1pm or when you hit profit.If you are successful, only use that 300 plus your profit to do it again the next day. *  Only buy ITM options or the strike price close to ITM. Some say the option's delta should be .7 or higher, that is very conservative. But the higher the delta the more likely that you will be successful.  * Give yourself time, so buy weekly options with a full week or more. For example, if you were buying today (19th) the expiration date to buy would be the 27th. * If the market is red, buy your option and hold it because you will get a deep discount on the option. You will probably need to hold it for a day or two.   * Don't be greedy. Sell your option as soon as it is green. set a target profit. For example, decide in advance that you will be happy if you make 50 , 60, 70 dollars. Whatever your target is, sell when it is at that profit. Don't be tempted to buy back because it went higher.  The high of the day and the most volume is in the morning. Wait until it dips the next day.   The reason I picked Draft Kings is that it has a lot of support. The stock has lots of volume and that means that the options have a lot of movement, which means that you have a lot of room to get it right. You can also practice with more stable companies like American Airlines or Bank of America.Anyway, I am also new to options but I have been successful by focusing on one stock and learning its stock price movement.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 06:31:25'] Take your 1k and park it in something safe like ETFs or below-NAV SPACs.  Do paper trading to learn credit spreads and entry points.  Once you have a handle on that start doing credit spreads on larger cap stocks/ETFs.  Never risk more than 5% of your account on 1 trade.  That doesn't mean max loss of $50, just that your stop-loss level is no more than a 5% account risk.  Once your account is over 10k from spreads and adding more via deposits then you can start selling CSPs.  Then after you've got that down and built your account further you can start buying options.

My advice, therefore, is to take risks but take educated risks than impulsive risks.

If you made 50% on a trade and keep looking back because you realize later you could have made 75% instead that will lead to bad decisions in the future.DO NOT GET GREEDY.  Set small, realistic goals to start.  100% in a week is great but it isn't sustainable.  2% per month is a small, realistic target to start.  To put that in context, starting with $1000 at age 20 at 2% per month is over 40 million at age 65.  Greed generally results in poor decision making.You will not go broke taking profits.

You tend to only hear from the people where the flip went kn their favor. - the reason I say to buy shoes and do other things is that if you LOST your $1000 - think of all the things you could’ve done with it to make your life better. This is the TRUE value of your money. Alternatively - you look at it like “what if I earned $100 (10%)” - what impact would that have and is it worth the risk of losing the $1000.

If you’ve done your DD this will grow at a nice moderate pace. Now, sell weekly or monthly Covered Calls and collect the premium for passive income as your LEAPS grows. Make sure to sell the covered calls at OTM strikes at around .3 or .4 Delta just incase it moons and gets assigned you’ll still make a profit even though you’ll lose your LEAPS you can take that profit and start a new LEAPS contract and repeat the process. Earning the premiums against your contract will negate Theta decay on your LEAPS. Never let your LEAPS expire if you don’t intend on actually wanting to hold the shares, usually you’ll close it with about 3 months til expiration and start again. Use any leftover funds to buy actual shares in companies you want to invest in for retirement or to sell call options without having to purchase a LEAPS first. Look up the 2 best strategies in options with $1000 and watch YouTube tutorials. The one I laid out is referred to as a Poor Man’s Covered Call or PMCC. Another equally good strategic play is to start running the wheel which can also make great passive income without a whole lot to start with.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 10:45:12'] Based on what you posted, you're not ready. Start by opening a Roth IRA and stashing some cash in there. Then take that 1000 bucks and put it in Bitcoin.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 10:58:19'] i dont have a strategy however i feel we can do a daily spy put or calls and exit as soon as we make 10%  to 20%. for example today's spy puts at 441 costs $207, it swung b/w 170 to 270, so make the trade when it goes up by 10 to 20% to avoid losses..i am also a new bee so i could be totally wrong..
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 11:16:33'] I put myself in your shoes as a 20 year old myself. A majority of our age group think in terms of “today.” In other words, instant gratification. Forget all that, settle down, digest all the information you can, paper trade, and repeat. Don’t trade your own money until you can teach all that you learned to friends and family so well that they can understand it. I’m 20 years old and I am learning and taking my time to educate myself, and I think you should too. $1,000 is a gamble honestly—and I thought having $5,000 was enough for me to start and it’s not. It’s not worth losing all that money as a learning experience. Be disciplined and educate yourself.Edit: Even if it takes you many years… just remember we have the edge. How many 20 year olds are thinking about options?

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 11:29:52'] I think you should start buying stocks or cryptos first. 1000 dollars is too less for you to be able to do anything meaningful with options. I’d say try trading on a paper account first, then once you have several thousand dollars, move slowly to the real thing.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 12:28:42'] Kid, you're gonna be wealthy starting at 20. My advice is play loose and fast at first to learn you lessons. Then transition to a long-term strategy of sustainable growth. By the time you're 50 you'll have more than you could imagine now.I was once told some interesting advice from a trusted and vetted financial advisor. He said, the US GDP is what drives the US stock market. For example: The US population will continue to increase for the foreseeable future. This will in-turn increase GDP, thereby increasing the value of US stocks. According to him it's that simple. Long-term as long as population keeps increasing, the overall bull market will live on. Take it with a grain of salt as with all oversimplifications, but it really helped my confidence in long-term investing. Good luck and I'm proud of you for thinking this way at such an early age. You got this!

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 13:05:06'] Don’t. It’s risky and there’s many lessons that only the market can teach you-and the price for such classes is high. Now that you’ve ignored me (i get it options are fun lmfao), study the Greeks, open interest volume and implied volatility. Once you feel like you’ve got it down I recommend buying options. While you are more likely to lose your risk is defined to the money you put down to own said option. I would buy an option that’s around 3 months out (one month at the very least) on a company you have done lots of research on and have strong conviction so that if/when your option loses value you don’t panic. Trust me. You WILL panic at some point. 3 months-1month time frame Theta won’t fuck you but anytime after that it becomes the final boss that you will lose to nearly every time. Next make sure ur IV is low and ur OI & volume is high that way you can get in and out without issue if something happens for whatever reason. Next. Send it when you’ve found a good entry point and ride it till you have found your predetermined exit point like any other stock you’ve traded in the past. Rinse repeat and reap your rewards.

Had less than a thousand a few months ago but had a 25k day not too long ago. Lesson learned there. Don't be greedy, take your profits. Scale in and out  of options and if you're going to let one run make sure it's on the house from scaling out your other ones. 25% is a great option. No need to only go for 1000% although they are nice
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 17:32:55'] A 20 year old that is about to begin an investing journey might be better served by not fooling around with options. You should also understand that very few "day traders" actually make money. Losses this early can be very costly over a time span of thirty or forty years. I would really recommend some kind of ETF like SPY  or some smaller SPY based ETF that isn't 400+ dollars a share, unless your broker lets you buy partial shares of something like that. Buy a 1000 worth now and add to it EVERY single check and a piece of every single raise. In the meantime study up on some stocks you might like and look to possibly diversify in time.  Equities, even SPY, are not without risk, but the risk is infintesimally smaller than options.If you insist on giving your money away, then look for higher volume stocks, since they usually have some decent option volumes.  BE aware that shrinkage (large bid/ask spreads effects) can eat you alive if you are trading illiquid stuff. Learn about TA and how it can help predict inflection points. It won't tell you which way a  stock is going to go, but it can indicate where the turn around might happen. Learn to exit bad trades fast and never ever let a winning trade turn into a loser. Lots of small wins. There is always another day or another stock.  I believe you can use options to poor mans day trade, but the cost of tuition can be high, and not many people make it through the curriculum before they go broke.

Question for the experienced here, should I be conservative and sell it for some small profit here before the Feb 16 earnings report, or is there reason to feel secure that it'll jump up and give me solid returns right before it expires? I won't lie, I dont have a ton of money set aside for investing and I kinda yolo'd a large percentage of that on this one call. I was sweating when it went in the red for a good while right after I bought, but its doing well now. I didnt go cheap, I bought what was just barely OTM at the time and I thought 255 was a very reasonable goal. Thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 21:46:55'] https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/NVDA/IV/  I’m sure this isn’t exactly perfect but it helps. Your basically buying at an IV that is 23% higher than the 252 historical volatility (59.8 IV vs 48.4 HV).Usually you would want to seek when IV is one Standard deviation over HV (16% in this case I might be mistaken could be tho). If you are that bullish calls. If you want to play iv crush maybe a spread or something

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 18:43:07'] Wait til another day or two.  May never get to 272.50You have a few choices…1.) roll it out and up.  Longer date and higher price2.) close it out - lose money buying it back3.) if the price drops this week - buy a call at like 275 - this is protection.  Then  if you get assigned your trading platform will exercise your call to cover the assignment4.) buy the stock at 272.50 or less to cover the assignment

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 08:34:43'] I'd buy back the $272.50 call and sell a 2022-04-08 $280 call (2 weeks and increase of $7.50 in strike). You'd net $1.85 credit. Alternatives could be:* 2022-04-08 $275 for more credit ($3.90) but more likely to end ITM.* 2022-04-08 $285 for less credit ($0.15) but more likely to end OTM.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 16:51:15'] You get the most money from rolling when you're as close to the money as possible, as late as possible. But it's much more profitable to be on the money and early than of the money and later. In other words, current price matters much more than timing. So with only 3 days to go, if you see it touch your strike, roll immediately.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 19:50:27'] Assuming your cost basis is lower than $272.50:I also think you should do nothing. Decent chance it doesn't close above your strike price, and even if it goes above $272.50 before Friday, there is no ex-dividend date event this week so little chance your shares get called away early. If it does close above your strike come Friday, just give this volatile market a day or two and buy back in even lower next week (since your account is tax free). If your cost basis is above $272.50: I would say avoid this scenario, but it's not like I haven't done it a million times myself...so just roll it up and out until you get a credit for the transaction!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 20:11:54'] I would probly close the covered call since investor day is tomorrow and just wait to see where the market takes the stock before opening another covered call on the position. There’s been massive call buying up through the 25March 280 strike plus the QQQ closed right at the $350 resistance line. If it breaks that resistance we’ll be at $357 fast and that’ll take up NVDA and the rest of tech
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 20:39:05'] I'm not a fan of rolling personally, but if you do roll then you'll likely want to wait until the day before your call expires to roll (march 24th.) However in the future don't sell a call at a strike you would be unhappy selling the share for. If you do take assignment, just buy the shares back on monday with your stack of cash with a buy-write since you can't use a CSP.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 21:10:22'] I have sold covered calls before then rolled them only to see the stock price go down after couple of days and I have essentially lost money in this rolling business as I bought back the call at much higher premium then I got. So...I would say let it get exercised if it gets called. Why are you trying to hold on to the stock? If you're bulling on the stock then just buy it again when you see a dip. Lock your gains!
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 05:35:40'] Do ya feel lucky?  Well, do ya punk?  1) Roll it out now and the stock crashes2) Keep it, and the stock crashes3) Keep it, and the stock moons4) Roll it out on expiry date.Depending on my mood, I usually do 4.  Minimum pain threshold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 11:55:47'] Honestly, I usually wait until the sold premium is all but gone, that is late in the day of expiration. If the spread isn't crazy, I'll buy back the option and sell another a week or two out. If the spread is terrible, I let it get called away, take profits and look for another trade. I don't fall in love with stocks or trades.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 18:57:36'] I will tell you all the best and easiest trading strategy to build wealth. This is a strategy that only 0.1% of all WSB use, it’s very rare in the autist community. 1. Find good companies with strong moats and strong leadership - buying back stock is also something I would look for (AMD, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Meta, VTI)2. Buy shares with all your disposable income for the next decade. Try and buy on dips when possible. Don’t be Cathie wood. Only buy with money you don’t need for 10x years. 3. Don’t waste time staring at your account. Check in every now and then but don’t do anything. Just buy dips when you can. And re-invest all dividends. 4. Focus your time on work and creating value for yourself. Don’t waste time trying to time the market or dwelling on paper losses or gains. 5. In 10x years, your account will have tripled (at least) and you can start taking some off the top to buy shares in up and coming great companies. Hold those, don’t sell, and check it again it 10 years. Rinse and repeat. Never buy options. Don’t panic and sell. Just add and hold, has worked for the last 100 years and will work for the next 100 years unless there is a nuclear war and if that happens who cares, we are all fucked.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-09 00:31:03'] It’s a great time to buy LEAPS, because the delta will offset the high vega. They are pricey right now, so try to calculate your profit based on a pure intrinsic value play where you deduct the premium you paid. If this doesn’t net enough profit given your price target, then it’s better to buy stocks. I look for LEAPS with IV preferably <40%, with a max of IV 80% on stocks where I expect high delta to offset the expensive extrinsic value.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-08 23:59:52'] I’m buying leaps on companies that got beat way down with the market that I like.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey everyone,\n\nSo I traded options for a few months and I was doing okay, until I decided to take a break and adopt a "wheel" strategy. I was basically selling Facebook and Nvidia puts and I was going to sell calls on them at around the same strike price or slightly lower. \n\nHowever the first week I did that I got assigned NVDA at 257.5$, and FB 225$. As you may know, NDA is now 160$\n\nMy FB is down too but not doing as bad; I am down 3k on the stock but was able to make 2k in premium, and will continue making some premium until it eventually gets called away. \n\nI\'m not sure what to do as the best play. I\'ve bought a short term lower strike price put to protect my NVDA from crashing "too" much, and I\'m selling some calls but premiums around the prices of 250$ or even 240$ are basically null. \n\nShould I sell lower strike calls to try to make some premium (200-220$ strike) at the risk of getting it called away, or should I still sell (much) cheaper 250$ calls at basically almost no return'
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 12:10:24'] The cardinal rule of the wheel is to trade only stocks you would willing to hold, for months if needed.  It is bizarre you were assigned the first week!  Did you sell the puts 30-45 dte?  Did you try to roll the puts to get more premiums and delay assignments?  While the wheel works best in neutral and bullish markets, the worst that can happen is you end up owning some stocks you don't mind owning.No one can know when the market or any stocks may rebound, so sit tight and hold these shares until they come back up.  We've seen markets tank like this and then move back up relatively fast sometimes.  If your analysis on the stock is still positive, and you have the capital plus adding more shares would not make any stock too much risk to the account, then I will sometimes sell more puts to keep premiums coming in which lowers the net stock cost of the shares.  Rolling these to avoid assignment, but if assigned then this will average down the net stock cost quickly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 05:57:17'] You’re not alone.  I’m finding the wheel strategy only works when the market goes sideways or up.  I’m seeing some huge losses with the recent market down turn.  The only thing working for me right now is buying puts and day trading deep OTM options.   Everything I’m running the wheel strategy on is in the red and not sure if I should continue to bag hold or just cut my losses at this point.  We’ll see how this week goes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 06:30:08'] Once you make up your mind, it will feel better. Saying that as I'm in the same position as you with WBD. In my mind, I've recognized it as a loss so any premium made will be a gain for me. Hope this helps.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 10:16:59'] I am not sure who coined the term 'wheel' but it is basically selling puts (maybe it is marketing).For example, if XYZ is $100 and you sell a $90 put, if it expires, you made the entire premium. If you get assigned you own the stock at $90. Then you sell a call against your stock. It is a covered call which is the equivalent position to a synthetic short put.If the underlying will trades sideways or up, then selling puts should work out (because your short options are going to expire worthless). If the underlying is going down, then this is a losing strategy because you are selling put options (or synthetic put options) on an asset that depreciates.If you think about it this way, then the only time you would want to do this is when the underlying is going sideways or up. Right now, most underlyings (including the major indexes) all all going down. Thus, selling puts is not going to be the brightest thing to do.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 10:44:35'] Wheeling is only functional in a neutral to up market.  In a down market, it gets clobbered because it is a long delta strategy.  These boards are littered with peeps who thought that the market would cooperate forever.If you've been hammered, learn about risk management.  Spreads is a good place to start.&#x200B;For example, if you had done a $250/$230 spread on NVDA, at $160, your long leg would be   worth $70 and the total loss would be less than $20.  With those numbers, you're still in the game with the ability to sell reasonably OTM calls..
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 06:32:02'] The point is to keep selling calls for peanuts until the price gets back. Why change the strategy because you are uncomfortable with the outcome so far?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 07:32:14'] Wheeling is not for volatile environments
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 17:22:51'] People keep  saying only wheel stocks you do not mind owning but never just say the reason is if the stock has any quality it will eventually go up.  But that means that if you are doing the wheel for short term strategy it might not work which is most of the people that start saying wheel gone "wrong".   It did not go wrong it is being used wrong.   In my opinion willing to own means long term like buy and hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 07:23:47'] Keep selling calls at your cost basis even if the premiums are peanuts. Hopefully you are long on NVDIA/FB, which will make it an easier task mentally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 09:18:22'] Wheeling is not a good strategy, you’re better off selling credit spreads

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-12 22:59:03'] Idk y u would think selling nvda calls at 250 makes any sense, as they r 90$ away from current price…. I’m not the smartest person in the room but u really really should be selling closer to 190-170$ strikes. Like r u even trying to make back ur lost money ? Or r u just selling calls for selling calls sake?. To me it doesn’t make any sense to sell so out of the money. Just because ur assigned at 257.5 doesn’t mean u have to sell around that. But that’s just my opinion…Edit: also looking at the nvda chart I see most of the drop is very recent, so maybe a little stupid of me to judge, but in my honest opinion we r not going to see any sort of massive rally for some time. I think there definitely will be a little bump up with in the next 2-3 weeks. But none of these big players r going more then 10% up and then slowly will fall again until a true bull catalyst comes, like Russia Ukraine ending, china lockdown ending or something else that is really big. So I’d say go for 190 maybe 200$ strike for the 30-45 day but going any higher is a bit silly as, it’s not really worth ur time. What I do is buy back the option at 50% profit and wait til a Green Day and sell again. But everyone has there own risk tolerance.

I shall attempt to break it down for you. MU - simply a case of technical movement, and supply meets demand. You will monitor this stock if you are into technical. Volatility crush is also real for stock prices. But if you don’t believe technical and you are into fundamental, tell me you have seen it’s PE, business model, demand, profit margin, and are unconvinced of the ongoing demand.NVDA - there is a reason why some stocks keep breaking new high and some stocks keep breaking new lows. NVDA has the fundamental, acquisition expectation, product demand, and profit margin. I bought at $605 and it’s now $800. After stock split it is only going to go up higher, if previous studies of stocks’ price movement after stock splits are anything to go by. AMD - i watched it since it was $60+ last year. Is it too much now? Maybe not the cheapest. But definitely not going down any moment. And I’m going vertical spread, PMCC, and naked puts with it. Majority of my options profit was from like 20+ trades on AMD, in the past 2 months. Tsm - I owned it at $63 and it’s only going to go up higher with the world’s largest producer of something that every product manufacturer needs, from aircon, to your fan and TV. In fact I’ve just initiated a PMCC position with it. And you mentioned a good point about China, SMIC simply is not a business that I would want to own against Tsmc, given its current state of production capacity.

Until AMD can lead some aspect of tech or have a wide enough product line to bring in more revenue investors wont like into it. Traders keep the cycles going but investors push the trend up. Investor buy in happens when they see the growth potential. Thats why when they came out with ryzen the writing was on the wall and everyone bought in after the sales started to flow and deals started to be made. While AMD is clearly eating Intel’s lunch on cpus, their gpus do not compare to nvda yet and they dont even offer storage or networking solutions. They have to expand or else investors will sell off since the growth isnt there. You can def make money trading on the short term trends though amd is so cyclical

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 19:07:14'] Mistake number one is having a target account value by a certain date. This will almost certainly cause you to make bad decisions along the way. You want to grow an equity account? Buy stock in profitable companies that are currently priced below value and have a reasonable chance of adding to their valuation over time. "Because it's X% under ATH" is a meaningless metric, because it assumes that ATH was a reasonable price to begin with. "Cheap for a reason" comes to mind. Many of the names you mentioned are not headed back to their ATH, probably ever, and some of them will likely be out of business by EOY.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 14:28:55'] You’d be safe if you bought shares and sell covered calls a bit above your entry price.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 15:32:38'] With vol so high just sell CSPs on names you want to long, maybe combined with some shares of companies that you 100% want a position inE: also, seems all your names are speculative growth, unprofitable or just ‘out there’ which is fine.. but like, why not get some solid blue chips for a discount? That opportunity doesn’t happen often and the likelihood of them going bankrupt with rising inflation and higher rates is much lower than the companies you listed
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 19:05:02'] Uber’s cash burn rate is astronomical, and they don’t make any money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-15 14:45:54'] You mention in a comment you have 6k.  That means you are looking for a bit more than 4x to 5x your account in 5 months.That is pretty unrealistic and you would need to be prepared to lose the full $6k to achieve that kind of result.  A simple way would be to put it all on red (or black) in a casino and hope to win two times in a row.  You have a roughly 22% of hitting $24k with this approach.Then I re-read your post and you said you can contribute $800/week, which means you'll have $19200 + $6000 or $25200 assuming you can wait until the end of October.  If you really believe in those names for the Long term, you could simply by $800 of shares from now through October and dollar cost average.  That way you don't have to worry about the ups and downs from now until then.Yes, you can leverage your dollars more with LEAPS, but if you can hit your goal Without the leverage, that may be the safer play - you don't have to worry as much about timing the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-11 17:25:22'] What I know is that you want to get to $25,000 by October and can put in $800 a week for the next 20 weeks which is $16,000.  What I need to know is how much you are starting with.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\nGoodmorning traders, Yesterday I said the rally does not have legs and here we are. Today is really important as to how next we plays out. It is expiration Friday,so big moves are likely. Picture the market being a runner and that you can only run so far before you are out of breath. When you run out of breath and got tired instead of putting your hands on your knees or walking to cool down you consolidated or walked/ran backwards to cool down. Also like any runner you build up your distance and endurance each time you run. This is the market right now; it is building up endurance to run (longer sell offs) and these sharp rallies are cool down periods. Which brings me to a conflicted moment. There is a level that if we fall below it opens up the pandoras box of sell side activity. That level I believe to be around 450 on the spy. Can we build up enough endurance to run that far, will large fund managers join the selling to get us there? I have said that large fund managers are doi'

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-18 21:05:22'] So I did the same thing actually I have 512/515 and 562/560 expiring friday. I only sold 4 of these. Then I realized that this is not the way to actually play this. The way to actually play this is with 470/475 and 585/590 expiring in December 18. I sold these for 2.08. My thought is what I am really trying to play is IV crush. The other play is strictly a gamble, a good one but a gamble. My bet is the December IC will be half the price I payed for it in two days and there was very minimal risk and more time to maneuver if there is a big play against me. I kept both IC's open.Any thoughts?

POST_TEXT: b'Hello!   \nIve recently been dabbling in covered calls. Ive been doing weekly covered calls. my goal is to add income, but not sell the underlying asset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel like I have  couple options on how to get income, but not sell my stock (long term hold).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. could put weekly price that is high, so likely to expire (not ideal, as premium is minimized).\n2. could do weekly that is lower=more premium/higher risk of sellingmight have to buy back call at a high price.\n3. could do monthly calls, decent return. But also, volatility allows me to buy back call at a lower price.\n\nwhich do you best reaches my goal of most income without sacrificing (selling)  the underlying stock.'
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 15:19:08'] Just wheel - if you get called away start selling weekly csp’s until you are long shares again - rinse and repeat
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 15:36:06'] If your goal is to not sell, then take a smaller premium. But also, if you wheel, then take the bigger premium and don’t worry about getting assigned. Switch to puts once you do.I’ve been doing my first wheel and deliberately sold my calls a bit more OTM because a dividend was in play, but now that I’m past it, I’m probably going with a closer to ATM call to grab more premium.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 14:49:45'] Why are you considering buying back the call option?That is anthetical to the entire theory behind writing call options against your position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 19:49:38'] How volatile is the underlying?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 05:18:51'] It also matters what your capital gains strategy is. If you’re short term then you could probably take higher risk for more premium. If your goal is long term, then low risk low premium or don’t trade CCs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 06:27:50'] If you don’t want to lose your shares for a long period of time, you can also buy and sell calls and puts with different strikes and expirations. There are a lot of different trading strategies you could use depending on the underlying and your goals. Tastytrade is a good place to start if you’re not familiar.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 11:30:30'] If you're not looking to ditch the underlying, you have a few options (pun intended):  Sell puts going into the position to start collecting premium on them, so if you do get assigned, you're a better price point for it. But only sell enough puts that make up a partial position that you would go in on. From there, strangle the position with puts on one side and calls on the other, collecting additional premiums to continue to beat up the cost basis. Along the way you may have to add to the position or sell some away. But if you plan to hold long term, you're okay doing both. Weeklies are attractive, but there's good money to be made in 30-60 DTE options. I would start there. There's more wiggle room and opportunity to manage any trades that go against you in the time frame as well.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-27 13:29:49'] tl;dr - test results for option 2 below. It works out okay if you are methodical, set good levels, have the time and attention to commit if you're close to your limit, and we aren't in a massively volatile market. I'm leaning option 1 for now. Thanks to the back-testing feature on ToS, I was able to test doing exactly what you describe in option 2, as I am interested in developing a similar strategy. I chose TQQQ as the underlying asset, sold weeklys that were between 6 and 8 percent OTM (I tested 6 and 7 percent OTM), and bought the contract back the instant the share price reached 99.9% of the strike price. It's a little time-intensive, so I have only completed the following results: * 6% OTM weeklys, June-August: $4.92 in premiums earned, $3.62 in premiums paid to avoid being assigned 4 of 13 times, net $1.30 profit* 7% OTM weeklys, June-August: $3.77 in premiums earned, $0.78 in premiums paid to avoid being assigned 2/13 times, net $2.99 profit* 7% OTM weeklys, Sep-present: $5.54 in premiums earned, $5.47 in premiums paid, assigned 3 of the last four weeks, net $0.07 in profit, heading into a terrifying week to close out the quarter. There's potential, but it seems like a lot of work and requires lots of attention and firm rule-setting for if/when to buy back, and if you aren't able to hawkishly devote attention when it gets close, you either make decisions that deviate from your plan, or you snooze for a few minutes and suddenly the rebuy is at a much larger loss than you intended, forcing you to choose between getting assigned and eating a much larger loss than necessary at a volatile and sensitive point in the process.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-28 08:25:20'] Higher premiums imply a higher probability of being assigned.It sounds like you should consider a qualified covered call (https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/tax-implications-covered-calls) at or above a price you are willing to sell the shares.

POST_TEXT: b"What's up fellas at r/options. I made a tool called [FD Ranker](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/fd-ranker) that logs the average IV of popular tickers. The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\n\n**What is this tool good for**\n\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\n\n# Low IV Tickers List\n\n\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\n\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 07:15:33'] For the stocks that pay a dividend, especially a substantial one, like a lot of these on this list do there should probably be a discount.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 08:55:45'] AAPL  IV% is 55.9% right now. FB is 53.6%. These are straight from Tastyworks. Where are you getting your numbers from?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 09:30:25'] So noobie question, if I’m buying a stock option with low iv% like 15% that means that option premium will decay slower than one with a high IV?

I have some expiring options that I did not make a profit on as of right now (I would have had if I have sold them before the earnings). I am about to lose around 600-700 if I sell them at the current price. I only recently started doing some option trading and made around 1500 in total addition to equity. However, the decision to purchase Apple options ended up to be wrong as comparable Nvidia and AMD options at the time of my purchase budget have risen by at least 4-5 times in value. I learned a lot from this purchase, such as the need to diversify or not risking enough, and hoping that I can at least make some extra hundreds on this options and use my gained knowledge to continue my growth. \n\nFeel free to share your thoughts/ opinions.

At the money calls are only $2 and could easily be worth $10+ by expirationStill, ETFs are weird. I've been following META since they were new (before FB changed its name). I thought the hype of the Metaverse would take off and while the ETF did have a good run up to $17, it's given back all of those gains so far.I think FB could ironically pose a threat to META. It's been lagging behind other tech stocks and honestly I don't think Zuck's metaverse is really exciting anyone right now. The rebranding seems to have lukewarm response and it could be years before anything tangible actually comes from the changes. But MSFT and NVDA are two tickers that should be guaranteed to gain next year. RBLX is a toss up. So all in all, I think you're better off just investing in MSFT and NVDA. The low price of META is enticing but honestly I don't think its holdings are all that strong. SNAP is a piece of crap and I think AMZN is in for a rough year in 2022

I spent all night reading and watching videos and a lot of people (not financial advice, gambling casino etc) are saying morning will continue tanking so buy puts, but next week should have a very nice bounce back so buy further expire calls during the low point and they should print next week.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-19 05:59:15'] Nvidia (NVDA) - Shares of popular recommendation Nvidia are up almost 2% following the company’s second-quarter earnings report after market close yesterday. The graphics chip maker delivered investors a record quarter, with revenue rising 68% to $6.5 billion and net profit increasing almost 4 times year over year to almost $2.4 billion. The big concern for the company is supply. Management said that the company is struggling to meet customer demand, with global chip supply shortages expected to continue in the near term. High demand is a great problem to have, but we’d love to see Nvidia overcome those supply issues.Nvidia announced an acquisition of ARM Holdings last year. The transaction is still in process, but potential benefits are already apparent.How long has Nvidia been contributing to Stock Advisor’s market-beating returns? Almost 16 years.Just because Nvidia is near an all-time high, that doesn’t mean the stock can’t still be a great investment.

Some shorts also fled GME and shorted AMD more instead. AMD always had some shorts, but it gained more shorts in that mess. It also had the awkwardness of being one of the restricted on Robinhood stocks when the GME stuff was playing out.I'm already down more than 10k on AMD this past month.

POST_TEXT: b'Im reasonably new, but I think I know the basics on options, but Ive only done calls/puts and CCs. Recently Ive been wanting to get into Nvidia but I dont have a huge amount of money to buy shares. As a result I started looking at LEAPS (still pretty expensive) and of course OTM calls. Based on my research, it seems the best way to gain exposure to an expensive stock without huge cash outlay or risk seems to be a spread. Buy a near ATM call and then sell a call at the same expiration to offset the cost.  Limited upside of course, but this seems to be the best way Ive found. \n\nAny thoughts on a better way to gain upside exposure without massive risk on a stock like Nvidia? I really wanted this stock back when it was 550, but I didnt know enough. Also, when the nvidia split happens, if I have options what happens to my options post split?\n\nThanks!'
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 04:49:45'] Yes!  To generate upside exposure to Nvidia put on a credit put spread or debit call spread. Investopedia has a good writeup on what these are and how they work. I personally prefer credit spreads because I like the decay aspect of the strategy, but either will offer upside exposure without needing the large capital required to own shares or run a pure call/put.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 05:38:56'] You can also buy partial shares on most brokerages now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 12:50:37'] create put credit spreads.SELL a PUT at a strike price that you think the share-price will NOT go down to from now to expiration.Then BUY a PUT at a lower strike price than the one you sold.You will get credit right away and then you just have to wait it out! (or close it out once the value drops).&#x200B;FOR EXAMPLE (using NVDA, which is currently trading at $820):SELL the $725 8/6 PUT.BUY the $720 8/6 PUT.You will receive approx. $70 once the order goes through.If the price drops past both strike prices your worst case scenario will be losing $430.You'll want to monitor the spread so you can get a handle on it and back out before it comes to that.&#x200B;BONUS POINTS:  If you want to turn the put credit spread into an IRON CONDOR, add this spread to the order above:SELL the $895 8/6 CALL.BUY the $900 8/6 CALL.You will get an additional $85 in credit, for a new grand total of ($70+$85 =) $155 in credit. The nice thing about adding this to the order is that it does not require any additional collateral/margin, plus your worst case buy back scenario is still $500, the same as it was on the PUT CREDIT SPREAD. And now your max loss would be $345.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 04:36:47'] If you have the money to buy a hundred shares you could write a put either ATM or a little bit ITM with the intention of getting assigned.  The premium received would lower your cost basis.  You could then choose to keep the shares for the long term or write a call to wheel the stock for the short term.Ideally you would want to be assigned really close to the strike price.  So say you write a put at 90 but at expiration the value is 89 or even closer 89.50.  You basically just purchased the stock below current market value.EDIT:Never mind you said you didn’t have the money to buy the shares.  😞
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 05:26:22'] Dude I have the same intention as you, and usually buying LEAP call or selling slightly OTM put will help. But NVDA’s price makes options a very costly affair, and people will then use its option for trading, and not for the purpose of owning the stocks. Let’s wait and see though, its options will then be far cheaper after the stock split
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 06:13:02'] You could use spreads or you could wait for the 4-1 split on the 19th.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 07:24:21'] The cheapest strategy will probably be a vertical spread. If you’re bullish then a call debit spread a put credit spread are both fantastic options! Both strategies although representing the same outlook, have their own pros/cons. With the put credit spread, you can take advantage of time decay as well as capitalize off of sideways movement on the stock, but an IV spike can be detrimental. So, volatile markets are something to look out for. On the other hand, call debit spreads are subject to time decay and can’t capitalize off of the stock trading sideways either. However, a spike in volatility is beneficial whereas as an IV crush isn’t.Between the two, I personally prefer the former strategy, the put credit spread. I think it’s a bit of an easier/safer bet!

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 04:30:03'] Just buy fractional shares.... read an article a little while back they’re looking to get into the NFT scene which long term in my opinion is super bullish
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-04 05:57:45'] A vertical or a diagonal spread would be the best way to gain exposure to an expensive stock.  What strikes you combine would depend on how much you're willing to spend, the probability of profit and the risk graph.    When stocks split, the options are adjusted to reflect the split.      A whole stock split results in a proportional increase in the number of contracts and a proportional decrease in the strike price.  For example, if you own one $50 strike price call on a stock that declares a 5-for-1 stock split, after the split you would own 5 call options with a $10 strike price (1 x $50 = 5 x $10).    Option adjustments are handled differently for fractional stock split  such as 3 for 2 or 5 for 2 because a trader cannot hold a fractional option contract. Therefore, the number of shares is increased from the standard 100 shares by the split ratio.     For example, one call option with a $60 strike price would become one call for 150 shares with a $40 strike price after a 3-for-2 split (100 x $60 - 150 x $40).    Large special dividends, mergers, and reverse splits are a bit more complicated.
POST: ['2022-02-01 21:46:11'] POST TITLE: b'Iron Condor and Implied Volitility'
POST_TEXT: b"Hello Options! \n\nNew member here. I've been trading for over 10 years and currently trade an account of about $50K, mostly for learning purposes. I've been doing alot of reading about options strategies over the past few months and finally feel confident enough to begin trading some more complex options strategies. Over the past two weeks I've been running the numbers on iron condor strategies for stocks with a share price over $200 and with implied volitility of over 30%. I've noticed that on stocks with a very high implied volitility (100 or more), if I create a spread between strike B & C that's close to 1 standard deviation (adjusted for my expiration of 45 days) the profit to loss ratio is roughly 1:2, with a very high percentage of success (68-71%), seems almost too good to be true. Is there something I'm missing about this strategy? Can anyone with experience trading iron condors tell me what I should be looking at? When evaluating a ticker to trade this strategy,  how important"
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 22:16:48'] Where is your 68-71% probability of success number coming from? Any probability of profit calculation is only an estimate, and relies on certain assumptions that may or may not actually hold up in practice. For example, a probability of profit derived from the standard Black-Scholes model is dependent on the model's assumptions holding, including that the underlying's returns are log-normally distributed. For high IV stocks in particular, the high IV can be interpreted to mean that the market thinks that there is going to be high realized volatility in the future. A highly volatile underlying means that its future price is hard to predict, so there can be a lot of uncertainty in any probability of profit calculation, and greater potential for Black-Scholes assumptions to break down.Regarding your last question, IV is important to me, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be chasing after the highest IV underlyings. Often IV is high for a reason; the market thinks that there are going to be huge swings, and I generally don't claim to know better than the market. Just as important, if not more so, is IV rank/percentile, indicating whether IV is currently relatively high or low compared to historical IV for that particular underlying. The point is that for most underlyings, IV tends to fluctuate within a range. By selling premium at the high end of the range (i.e. at high IV rank/percentile), the option seller benefits from any reversion toward the mean of the historical IV range, since short option positions have negative vega. But again, this doesn't mean that high IV rank/percentile is a green light for selling premium; IV rank/percentile might be high because there's something coming up that will cause higher realized volatility, like earnings. So while it's favorable to look for high IV rank/percentile, the trade should still be backed up by some investment thesis on the underlying.

Next week nvidia is supposed to release the 3k series graphics cards on sept 1 and on sept 2 intel has a launch event where they are rumored to release something special(next gen cpu?). Since theres a bunch of catalysts, I could see a few bucks increase next week. What yall think?\n\nEdit: expiration date: sept 11'
	COMMENT: ['2020-08-29 09:35:55'] Intel is releasing 10nm SF based Tiger lake soc for laptops. It has dramatically greater clockspeeds than last year's icelake. I did buy couple of $48 9/11 calls and its already tripled from my purchase price. I am thinking of adding more on monday at $52 or so. It will get a boost next week and week after that for sure. Also beyond Tiger lake dont forget Intel is buying back $10B worth of their stock. That will keep the stock price above current levels. Another thing is when you compare AMD to Intel as a company dont forget that Intel is more than just CPU manufacturer for Laptops, Desktops and Servers. If you take out all their earnings from client/server chips, their revenue is still greater than AMD. They have a growing storage portfolio (Optane/3D nand), self driving chips(growing at a fast rate), FPGA/ASICS, Silicon photonics. Almost every AMD laptop uses Intel Wifi chips which are the best laptop wifi chips in the market. So Intel has many growth engines and at some point they will get their manufacturing back on track.  They will also leverage TSMC process(next year XE HPC/gaming graphic chips will use TSMC 6nm). I dont think this is a uber growth play but a good value play. They also yield 2.62% which is great.

If you buy that option Monday morning, it will expire in 8 trading days, and the decay will happen fast.  If things don’t quickly move in your direction, they will be moving AGAINST you.  Success comes from understanding and planning for the probability of you being wrong. Buying options that are about two months from expiration gives me a chance to be wrong on your original theory, but correct over the longer term. At this point, I don’t think there’s a good probability of a lot of meat being left on that bone.If you’re attracted to this option because it’s “only $44!”, don’t be. If that is all that you really have the budget for, with all due respect, I think you need to build up your account a bit more before diving into options. When it comes to the options available, there are almost infinite ways to make or lose money, but I’ve found that when I’m in a tight spot and buy an option I can afford rather than one I like and can’t afford, it rarely ends well. Think of it as buying a loser penny stock you can afford rather than a good growth stock because it’s too expensive.Also, one of my favorite resources is optionsprofitcalculator.com it’s easy to use and provides a good visualization on P/L on any available option play.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-13 11:15:32'] One reason we can speculate the volatility of Hershey's might go up, is that they were caught buying cocoa beans on options exchanges, trying to avoid buying from the facility set up with anti-child labor protections.1. Hershey's options purchases of cocoa beans send beans up higher 6 days ago: https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/11/22/cocoa-futures-skyrocket-thanks-reported-hersheys-trade2. None of this gets much notice, including when West African countries busted Hershey & threatened reprisal, except after the dispute is "settled" and Hershey's stock price actually ROSE for that reason 3 days ago: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-iac/interactive-ford-eastman-kodak-more.html. So far, Hershey's just sees net gains due to its bad behavior.3. But in the past couple of days, Hershey's child-labor cocoa beans buys is starting to get some attention. See this NBC article yesterday: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/the-war-on-cocoa-hershey-co-accused-of-not-upholding-sustainability-efforts-in-west-africa/2421880/Personally, I think Hershey's needs to be called out for its child labor cocoa beans buys, because it's not the first time it's been caught trying to undercut basic price controls in what is already one of the lowest-wage regions of the world, with or without child labor.  They also were called out for child labor chocolate in 2019:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/This is literally just brutally greedy behavior, because it's practically impossible to find labor that is cheaper than what these workers already make with the price controls. I'm seriously considering attacking Hershey stock on one of Reddit's forums, because they have been continuing to engage in this behavior. Stockholder activism is sometimes the only way these companies change abuses. tldr; Hershey's has been secret-buying child labor cocoa beans on options exchanges this year, and has been a problem behind child labor cocoa for years, in fact. It stock deserves some volatility right about now. This is a heads up I might post a rant about Hershey's behavior, asking for stockholder activism next week.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello, Ive been trading about 8 years and I recently developed a new options trading strategy out of boredom.   Turns out this trading strategy is insanely good.   I tested it for 3 months paper trading to refine it, followed by 3 months live testing. It works in a Bull or Bear market because of the specific requirements of the strategy. (Actually works slightly better in a bear market.) The average return is about 8% a day on 3 ish trades. 8% being the gain percentage of money used in those trades, not account value.   However the problem Im might be running into is scalability. The strategy itself is a scalping strategy so hold time is between 1-3 mins. I only trade high priced, high volume, low spread options so think Tesla, Nvidia, Roku, ect. At least 3-5 million volume a day.

By doing this you are already considering IV so high IV underlyings will have a wide range, making it more likely that you consider them as candidates to stay inside a range over a certain period of time.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-04 06:32:56'] If your plan was to buy high and sell low, go for it - sell now - but since that was not likely your plan, do not sell when we are in the middle of a dip or correction or whatever you want to call this. Sell only if something fundamental has changed with the company or your investment thesis. Last note: buying options is risky, as they are both volatile and they are essentially a wasting asset (time decay). I presume you are playing with gambling money (money you can afford to lose). Good luck.

AMD is currently sale pricing though, as are many other stocks.

POST_TEXT: b'Edit: sorry for the title, not really a double-diagonal, more of a calendar spread.\n\nSo I noticed while playing on OptionStrat that a put/call calendar spread on NVIDIA, cashed out before earnings are announced, looks like a high probability win. Am I missing something? I assume it will keep ticking up until earnings which sweetens the pot even more.\n\n[NVIDIA Calendar Spread](https://optionstrat.com/aFW9DGyisL)'
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 05:16:32'] I wouldn't call it a trap.  But I would say that these positions are impossible to evaluate properly with basic software like this because the software has to assume uniform implied volatility expansion and contraction and in reality, each week is going to expand differently.  The near week is going to expand more than the far week and that hurts you if you are short the near week and you don't hold through earnings, benefitting from the near week IV collapse.And if you hold through earnings, IV is going to collapse into the 35% area so lower the IV number in the link's slide bar for IV and see how much more red appears in the risk graph.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 04:00:31'] Are you sure that the screen capture you attached is double diagonal?!Looks more like a Bull Call Spread.  Double Diagonal is technically an Iron Condor with long position at longer expiry and short positions at shorter expiry.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-26 12:24:24'] Just to close loop on this, the position was a long 530 put at 6/4 and a short 530 put at 5/28 combined with a long 600 call at 6/4 and a short 600 call at 5/28. I bought them on 5/17 or about 9 calendar days before earnings.OptionStrat and Active Trader Pro both showed an estimated profit of $300-$500 as IV increased and selling before earnings and IV crush. As it played out, I ended up selling right before earnings and broke even.

	COMMENT: ['2020-10-27 14:07:41'] I'm looking at it with TOS and the numbers are close but not the same. I'd consider choosing a closer expiration for the long side. If you go with 12/4 the B/E's are virtually the same. Your max profit is lower at 254 vs 304, but the spread (and your max risk) will only cost you 1.58 instead of 3.98. One advantage for the longer expiration is it could allow you to make adjustments, roll the short call for extra premium and stay in the trade longer if you need to.

	COMMENT: ['2020-03-07 08:37:46'] The difference is that with Options (I’m assuming you’re just buying Calls for 2021/22), if the market/stock stays in a sideways/downward trend, it is possibly for your Calls to not be profitable at all or very limited. You’ve given yourself a firm deadline for this to happen (yes, I know you can roll them). At least with stock purchases, you don’t need to time the stock/market moving up, because you’re holding. So, it’s a long-term mindset. Personally, I’m down for both options as a means of making money.

However, if the stock crashes, you could get a margin call and be forced to sell at a loss if you can't come up with funds from another source to deposit in your account. You will also have to pay interest, perhaps as much as 9% depending upon your broker, for the privilege of borrowing the money.Perhaps you don't like this level of exposure. Given your conviction, you might consider using LEAPS instead of the common stock. You look to the pricing tables published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and see that you can purchase a call option expiring nearly 20 months and 3 weeks away, with a strike price of $17.50.Put simply, that means you have the right to buy the stock at $17.50 per share any time between the purchase date and the expiration date. For this right, you must pay a fee, or premium, of $2.06 per share. The call options are sold in contracts of 100 shares each.You decide to take your $20,500 and purchase 100 contracts. Remember that each contract covers 100 shares, so you now have exposure to 10,000 shares of GE stock using your LEAPS. For this, you have to pay $2.06 x 10,000 shares = $20,600. You rounded up to the nearest available figure to your investment goal. However, the stock currently trades at $14.50 per share. You have the right to buy it at $17.50 per share and you paid $2.06 per share for this right. Thus, your breakeven point is $19.56 per share.If GE stock trades between $17.51 and $19.56 per share when the option expires nearly two years from now, you will suffer some loss of capital. If GE stock is trading below your $17.50 call strike price, you will have a 100% loss of capital. Hence, the position only makes sense if you believe that GE will be worth substantially more than the current market price, perhaps $25 or $30, before your options expire.Say you are correct and the stock rises to $25. You could call your broker and close out your position. If you chose to exercise your options, you would force someone to sell you the stock for $17.50 and immediately turn around and sell the shares you bought, getting $25 for each share on the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-stock-exchange-358113). You pocket the $7.50 difference and back out the $2.06 you paid for the option.## The OutcomeYour net profit on the transaction would be $5.44 per share on an investment of only $2.06 per share. You turned a 72.4% rise in stock price into a 264% gain by using LEAPS instead of stock. Your risk was certainly increased, but you were compensated for it given the potential for outsized returns. Your gain works out to $54,400 on your $20,600 investment, compared to the $14,850 you would have earned.Had you chosen the margin option you would have earned $29,700 but you would have avoided the potential for wipe-out risk because anything above your purchase price of $14.50 would have been a gain. You would have received [cash dividends](https://www.thebalance.com/dividend-investing-introduction-357452) during your holding period, but would be forced to pay interest on the margin you borrowed from your [broker](https://www.thebalance.com/the-new-investor-s-complete-guide-to-brokers-357412). It would also be possible that if the market tanked, you could find yourself subject to the [margin call](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-margin-call-358106).

	COMMENT: ['2020-03-07 11:29:00'] True replacement of a stock with options would be virtual long stock using Short put + Long call at same strike price.Your premium earned from short put pays for long call and your risk profile is similar to buying 100 stock.If you want downside protection, you can Mimic virtual Long Call, by buying an additional Long put.Buying a leap vs virtual long call, has the major difference that you can use long put to hedge for losses while still being in the game. And if you believe in the company, you can get assigned stock via short put at expiry.

	COMMENT: ['2020-03-07 22:09:01'] Calling bottoms or tops is a fools errand. The market does not pay any heed to your desired level.If IV is still high when you see it “bottoming” I would look to go long the UL by selling OTM puts. You can give yourself a cushion and sell 16-20 deltas or just sell atm if you want more long delta and don’t mind being assigned the stock. If desired you can cap your loss using a put spread instead of a naked put.
	COMMENT: ['2020-03-07 09:34:17'] For this I have purchased LEAPs on SPY. As someone correctly pointed out you can buy them at a massive discount right now and have a nice comfortable timeline to sell them back to the market if you get gains. It's difficult to tell how long this all will last, but the likelihood of the SPY not at least having a few days or weeks where it doesn't surges back up and gives you the potential for tons of profits would be rather unlikely. With Options you're trying to take advantage of the IV and speculative nature of the stock, and any lead up to an event regarding the state of the market would be enough to cause it to spike in value especially at these low premiums. I bought some Jan 21 @ 390c for 30 cents a contract. That's quite a bargain, and I don't plan to hold onto them very long if things turn around. I also bought a meme one of Jan 22 @ 420c lol. So maybe I am just fuckin' around at this point. But having said all that owning Stocks at a reduce rate will ALWAYS be the better, safer, more reliable means of gains. So I would strongly recommend you try to do both and don't over-expose yourself in Options trading even with LEAPs.

And I'm feeling pretty bullish on nVidia both short and long term ..."
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 04:11:53'] This close to expiration, your risk is very high, though if the current pre-market price holds, you'd be looking at perhaps a 60-70% probability of max profit (need to wait until the market opens to see how the position P/L changes). Your breakeven price is around $591, which is pretty decent. The odds are in your favor currently. What happens over the next 3 days is anyone's guess, so be prepared for a max loss on the position if the market takes any kind of downturn, even a 1-2% mini-correction in NDX. These types of trades are best kept small, and shouldn't be used for making any significant returns on your account overall. I've done hundreds of these kinds of short-term plays, and while the probability seems like it's on your side, the reality is that those probabilities don't take into account any *unpredictable* external events. This is why we love giving a trade time. Bull put spreads placed 30-45 days till expiration have a much larger safety net due to time being on your side in case a downward move occurs.In any case, if you do open the position, I wish you luck.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 04:36:04'] Looking at the current entry point - the price is pulling off all averages sharply.   I’d be more confident in a bullish strategy if the the stock was at a pullback support .  Currently the 9 day MA Is under $560 after the recent strong run up.

Is this due to changes in IV or other factors im just not thinking about?  \n\nIve seen this a few times where the underlying starts off high, and bounces a bit with some higher peaks later in the day while the option contract does not necessarily correlate with its own daily session highs.'
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-12 11:31:13'] This is a graphical representation of your position using Option Net Explorer. You can see the theta is going to start hurting this trade. Even the platform makes sure you notice the theta.https://ibb.co/wLbP4Lm
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-12 19:27:22'] I answered this EXACT question about SHOP like 2 days ago.  NVDA has an earnings coming up tomorrow after the close.  Did you know this when you opened up this position?  SHOP had it's earnings today.If you did, and you plan on holidng it through earnings, you can forget about what it's M2M PNL is now because that's all noise.  All you need to know is you need NVDA to pop up pretty hard on earnings for you to be profitable, but if it blows through 300, your rate of return greatly increases.  You'll need it to go to at least like the 290 range or so for you to be about even after the earnings.If you are wondering why intraday you see so much flucuation, it's because this is a skew option that only has value because of the earnings (otherwise on a normal non-event week, it's pretty worthless), and that is greatly affected by upside call supply/demand, as well as any sharp up moves by NVDA (which actually has happened, but I'm not sure if you opened this up when NVDA was in the 250s or not).  If there is little movement in NVDA stock, like today for most of the day, it's all skew.But since you knew NVDA had an earnings tomrorow afternoon, you shouldn't care too much about that.  You'll find out what your true PNL is by end of day Friday since almost all the realized vol comes out from Thursday night to Friday.If you didn't know NVDA had earnings tomorrow afternoon, then you should have never opened up this kind of position imo.  If you just wanted to capture the up move of NVDA on normal days leading up to earnings and sell before, you should have opened up a 270 call.
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-12 11:11:12'] A sale may not have occurred yet, so the price stays the same. Look at the bids and ask for a more constant idea of the value. And yes you are right, IV may have played into a higher extrinsic value than the intrinsic value would have dictated
	COMMENT: ['2020-02-12 12:29:55'] With a bit more than a week to go your OTM calls are going to lose value not only every day but every hour that nvidia doesn't approach $300.  If nvidia dropped 10% in the morning, and slowly recovered, your options would be worth "less" than they would be if it had stayed the same price.  IV is mean when you have OTM options expiring soon.

One of the defining features of calendars is that you can't establish a max profit when you put the trade on, since you are working with 2 different volatilities (front and back expiration). The best you can do is get an approximation and even then if conditions change drastically your numbers will be off. If you look at a vertical spread for example, no matter what the market does, your max profit and max losses don't change and are easily obtained prior to putting the trade on.>I’m just wondering as a beginner why I didn’t do this earlier. Am I missing something?Ahh, the feeling of finding something that seems too good to be true.... What you are missing is that the same mechanism that is giving you profits if the underlying pins or is around your strike price (bigger theta in the front expiration) is the same mechanism that will kill your trade if the underlying price moves violently (bigger gamma in the front expiration). Mind you, your max loss IS INDEED defined and is the initial debit you pay when you establish the trade.Another feature that you didn't mention is that traders look at a trade that is both POSITIVE theta and also POSITIVE Vega and they seem to have found the holy grail. The truth is more complicated than that. I actually looked at this very topic in this video:[https://youtu.be/S7CBoNHqo9U](https://youtu.be/S7CBoNHqo9U)This is not to say that calendars don't have their place in someone's portfolio. When you want a trade that is aiming for a narrow range of the underlying with some theta working in your favor, and with defined risk (max loss) you can go for calendar spreads. Just be aware of where your profits are coming from and where calendars can go sour.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 09:38:04'] It takes active management, instead of doing something like vertical spread. Compare the return with a vertical and lmk what it looks like

POST_TEXT: b"NVDA had a great week; however, I am skeptical about their new cards performance. There has not been any 3rd party benchmark results released since their announcement. There is skepticism in the gaming community that this card will not be as great as NVDA claims it will be. As a result, given this skepticism I'm anticipating poor benchmarks in the very near future and a pullback because of last weeks run up. \n\nI legged into some weird option setup and I just wanted to share it. I basically sold some put credit spreads 260/262.5 and opened some put spreads 270/265. My target price for Monday is 265. I also opened 3 additional 260s, for the case it tanks. This trade will be closed Monday by EOD, expect the credit spreads will ride if it stays above 265\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/hdmdXAk.jpg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ic0k7Ra.jpg"
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-25 07:30:04'] The 8 x 260 // 5 x 262.5 is interesting. Looks like you legged in for a $37 debit, with massive upside if you are correct with relatively small risk. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-25 07:30:13'] > I am skeptical about their new cards performanceMe too, but didn't Jensen say the 2070 would out perform the 1080ti? That seems to be fairly consistent from generation to generation with the next generation midlevel enthusiast card outperforming the previous generation flagship. And the press embargo date is not until September 14, so why do you expect this movement before August 31?
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-25 09:04:33'] I guess I never get the rationale of these complex multi-legged trades. Given that you have this strong directional hunch, and you have a one-week frame, why don't you just buy an OTM put  and let it go??I also think your hunch is naive. No tests will be released until the press embargo so there is nothing to trigger this trade. And your guess that the card will disappoint is probably wrong. And your guess that if the benchmarks are weak the stock will therefore plunge is probably wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-25 07:26:00'] Are you familiar with how spreads value changes over time?  You might not get as much movement as you expect on Monday.
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-25 09:52:22'] Careful with this.  The new cards are pretty expensive and more for early adopters of RTX tech and those driving 4k. Most gamers not buying these will still be loading up on their 10x series. 
	COMMENT: ['2018-08-25 07:39:48'] Not really a setup that I see too often...It's almost like a condor with extra downside puts?&#x200B;Was there any sort of specific criteria you were looking for in selecting the legs of this trade?

	COMMENT: ['2019-05-16 19:57:57'] If you're really serious about trading more complex strategies with your own twist, you should look into a software package that will allow you to backtest and model trades. I use Option Net Explorer.You don't HAVE to have it, but this would be a case where nobody is going to know exactly what you should do. This is the case with most complex option trades, but at least if you can model different scenarios, you can come to your own conclusion.EDIT: Brokerage platforms don't come close to being able to model or backtest. TOS is the best I've found that's free, but it uses EOD data. Option Net Explorer uses 5 min increments.
	COMMENT: ['2019-05-16 21:32:09'] What do you mean by "increasing size?"Usually if one side is tested people roll up the other size. for credit, keeping the wings the same size, but decreasing the width between them.For NVDA though, just leave it until the call side actually gets challenged, or close it. Rolling up is a defensive move to decrease your max loss. If you have a winning trade already, leave it or close it.

	COMMENT: ['2019-08-16 13:47:51'] After earnings, and still trading around 160, I'm surprised they're still trading for what you originally got them for. I'd have expected the long call to go way down in value, as well as the short call. I'm not sure why you'd expect to still profit at 160. This is pretty far OTMFor plays like this, I tend to buy a LEAP ITM call, then sell covered calls in near month expiration against it.
	COMMENT: ['2019-08-17 03:56:49'] One thing to watch with this trade is the Vega.  Your profit calculator will show a deceptively nice profit area prior to earnings.  When the IV comes in (IV Crush) it'll have a greater impact on the longer dated option.  So the profit mountain you see before earnings typically turns into a molehill.I do do a lot of diagonal spreads like this, just not around earnings in particular.  I often buy LEAPS and repeatedly sell shorter term against them.  Earnings come and go.

A $2.5 wide spread is not worth managing (I don't even think about it if it's under $10, at which point it's basically a synthetic naked replacement).You were not comfortable losing that money in IC, shouldn't have opened it. Rolling into an iron fly can be an option to reduce the loss or break even maybe.Finally, playing weeklies in NVDA has such a high gamma risk that you don't give your IC a chance. With longer duration the underlying may fall back and accommodate you, it's a fair game until the last day. NVDA moves.

	COMMENT: ['2017-09-16 18:51:10'] 1) That's not a naked call if you bought it. 2)NVDA, while high in IV is not a good iron condor underlying IMO 3) stay mechanical - what was your plan when you bought the extra call? If you had an exit plan, good, but it feels like you tried chopping both sides which isn't always a plan.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi I'm relatively new to options and still studying different strategies to get to grips with everything but while I do so I have a real world scenario I'd like some advice on. I'm actually trading European Warrants and not US Options but for all intents and purposes of this post they work the same way.\n\nI currently have a Call Spread on AMD, the closest expiry is in June of this year and the furtherest away is Jan 2019. I'm currently 50k in profits from this spread and am quite bullish on AMD going forward.\n\nWith that said I do expect there to be natural pullbacks at different stages and with how much the stock has run up recently would be expecting a pullback within the next few weeks.\n\nMy question is, is there a certain percentage of my profits that would be advisable to put into Puts for the next month to cover the pullback I expect? I'm not looking to sell my calls anytime soon as I am longterm bullish, so barring any negative information coming out that changes my outlook I want "
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-07 05:19:19'] If you're confident that AMD is generally headed higher, why not buy more calls when it does pull back?  You seem confident that the JAN 19's are going to be profitable at expiration, then just ride it out, selling nearer dated calls against them along the way.5-10k in puts against a 50k profit does seem like a reasonable ratio.  But it's how how much you spend on the puts, its which puts you buy.  Do you have a specific time frame you're looking to protect?  Are you talking about buying JAN 19 puts?Here's one more thing to consider: If you believe a pullback is coming, why not just realize some of the gains and keep that cash handy for the pullback?  Depending how confident you are, you could even close the whole position.  There's no cheaper hedge than pulling out. (I know, that's what she said)
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-07 06:13:34'] I personally don't like buying puts to hedge. It increases cost basis. I'd rather sell calls (although it seems like you already have short calls against your long calls).You could roll the calls down a strike and take in more credit, or do what /u/doougle suggests and sell some or all. Take your profits and buy back at a reasonable price.Or, sell everything and immediately sell puts at your desired re-entry price. I think I like this plan the best.
	COMMENT: ['2017-02-07 08:19:42'] Why don't you calculate the delta of your spread position and hedge by shorting a percentage of that delta directly in stock. It is the cheapest and most direct meyhod, though it uses some capitsl

	COMMENT: ['2017-01-28 18:08:30'] "Using options, on the other hand, can reduce risk and increase reward." - how do options reduce risk if you're just buying outright calls?Unless I'm missing something it looks to me that all you've found is that over a random sampling of 3 earnings season for a handful of stocks, the majority see an increase in value in the fortnight prior to an earning release, a 'run-up' if you will. You've attempted to tie it in with a retrospective long call strategy and this makes no sense to me. How are you converting the historic stock % performance into how an OTM call would have acted and then posting results as if they were accurate? For example lets take the first line, NFLX on 2016-10-17: where are you getting the $1,150 figure as value of your $100 investment in a call, if the stock increased 13.64%?Not to mention you say "please note that these projections assume options for each stock can be purchased for under $2 two weeks prior to earnings releases." Well ATM calls for AMZN start around $23 each, GOOG at $7 and NFLX at $4.Why did you go back 2 seasons to mid 2016 season then jump all the way back to mid 2014 season? Have you considered how offside the call might go in those 2 weeks via theta decay along with being OTM? You don't mention how many DTE your call will be at purchase. Edits: it makes less and less sense to me the more I read
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-28 18:11:36'] That is some good analysis. Flaws? Buying calls is obviously a bull market strategy. It has been a bull market. Back test bull market strategies with bull market data, and mostly you'll get winners. The $64,000 question is if a person thinks the bull market continues to roll on? Or not?Another flaw might be how a person selected those particular stocks. Did they subconsciously select stocks that they knew had big moves? Or some kind of true randomizer algorithm to eliminate subconscious hind sight bias? I don't know, but subconscious selection can be a big pit for back testing this method. Third flaw might be that option premiums tend to oscillate. After a cycle with some big wins for option buyers, premium sellers tend to become more cautious, and premiums go up. After a cycle with not much movement, premiums tend to drift back down, again presenting opportunity for option buyers. Overall, earnings plays tend to be crap shoots. A cynic might say that you managed to select a small data set with a lot of 7's being rolled. Personally, I wouldn't place any money on that kind of system, but I've seen a lot worse trades pitched on this sub, so have at it, but don't cry if there aren't as many 7's in the real time data going forward. It is what it is, a crap shoot.
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-29 06:21:20'] Besides the obvious flaws with pricing, volatility crush, theta decay, I see a problem in the way you determine risk. Risking 100 to make 1000 is swell, but with a trade like that your probability of success is going yo be around 10%. I can risk $1 to make $20000, its called a scratch off lottery ticket, but my odds are ridiclously low.  A profitable strategy shouldnt just have a good potential payout for tha capital used, but a *likely* payout. I don't mind risking 200 to make 100 if my odds are a 70% chance of profit (aka selling you those calls and theta and volatility that come with iy and will subsequently dissappear.) I would have no problem selling the calls you want to buy and I'm almost certain it would be profitable for me.
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-29 20:23:12'] >Using options, on the other hand, can reduce risk and increase reward.Other people answered your question about IV, but I wanted to say that it took me a long time to really accept that the relationship between risk and returns is always positively correlated. Options always increase risk and increase return, or decrease risk and decrease return, but they never move in opposite directions. You're just hoping that the risk moves less than the returns so you make (or save) money.The way is was explained to me is that a transaction which offered a guaranteed way to decrease risk and increase returns would be an arbitrage opportunity and the high-frequency algos will compete it out of existence. So, if you think you have one its a good time to re-examine the model closely. Edit: And make sure you're not building models on bid/ask spreads at the close. Like 99% of my profitable strategies end up being due to using end of day pricing. They're pretty much lies.
	COMMENT: ['2017-01-28 18:26:48'] Too many false assumptions here, IMO. The biggest being that the call will be worth anything comparably close to an initial value. The implied volatility will disappear instantly post earnings, and your only gain will be the intrinsic value. But to make a cent, the UL price must go above the call strike price and then the  cost of the option. With tech sector earnings being flat to down this season (well, STX was an exception), what are the chances? To give you an example, the ATM MSFT call was 1.57 pre earnings and dropped to 0.56. The stock also ticked up a tiny bit only.Another problem is these tech stocks are too correlated, so you are just getting bigger without true diversification.Just a few ideas to consider, as this is a lengthy subject. Play earnings across different sectors (not just components of /NQ). Play different directions, not just bullish on everything. Use diversified, often more efficient strategies in terms of capital use. Option chains differ in quality, but e.g. for going long you have lots of choices, like put (spread), ratios, Jade lizard, super Bull, PMCC, etc. Buying a call is probably the toughest to make work.
