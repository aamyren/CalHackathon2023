	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:32:44'] They didn’t say A.I. enough.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:43:12'] Let Tim cook
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:16:08'] It’s just a classic sell the news situation
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:01:32'] The easiest thing they could have announced is Siri AI coming to apple products soon.  Done, up 20%!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:27:03'] Buy the rumor, sell the news.  This is a conventional cycle.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:48:16'] Oh no not a 00.15% drop! I'm ruined!!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 11:58:07'] it happens at most apple events, selloff at moment of announcement.  large capital timing trades.  should rally over next few days so buy now
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:05:27'] Stock is at an all time high. People are taking profits. This is how it’s done.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 11:50:06'] Wasn’t the headset thing already anticipated?I guess the stock is going to be for sale again
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:14:14'] This is just investors taking profits. Everything was pretty much as expected and some better than expected. The only negative bit that I can think of from the keynote was the $3500 headset price vs $3000 expected. Stock will probably be back to 185 by Wednesday probably.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:15:25'] I have been deep in the VR scene since its inception with the Virtual Boy for the Nintendo. This headset is absolutely insane if the specs that are being written in the news articles are correct. It has a 4K screen per Eye at least. It is Micro-OLED which is the pinnacle of display technology especially important in VR headsets. It reaches up to 5000 nits and has 4000 Pixels per Inch (PPI). These specs are absolutely groundbreaking to say the least. This headset is at least 5 years ahead of its competition. The downside is, that it also costs 8x more than the competion. 3500$.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:08:16'] Bastards couldn’t reach this ath when I held 400+ shares
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:03:46'] Dude this is so stupid Apple is still way up from last month. It doesn’t really matter
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:44:53'] Just wait until they come out with an AI focused gimic 2 years after the hype starts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:20:35'] Apple is the best company out there for long-term investing. I’ve held it for decades also retired off of. When news comes out like this it’s bought by the simplest investors at the height and pulls back about 10 15% as the hedges move money to other areas and then put it back into Apple is the simplest Rotation out there. Apple is a perfect example of buy high and sell low which most unexperienced investors do with the stock. It’s always a Buy hold
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:02:00'] Sold my calls at the top, I ain’t mad
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:16:19'] Tim Cook got confused with the assignment. The phrase of the day is AI, not AR

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:17:03'] Yeah, what happened here? It was on the way to $185!!! Sooo close!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:43:39'] Y'all joke, but if anyone can make Google glasses with AR/VR and AI be cool enough to wear, it's Apple.The Humane Ted Talk is when I went all in on Apple. Ironically, not all in on Humane. Chaudri gave a great demo, and it convinced me that Apple will be the ones to do it. Like all things Apple, they won't be the first or have the most features, and it will be overpriced, but they'll be the ones who make the thing real people actually adopt.They'll steal it all from Humane or something, sure, but it will be the Apple version that wins.That's my bet anyway. Remind me in 5 years. We'll see if I went wrong by buying Apple stock right before the next biggest revolution in personal computing.I don't think many people have said that, but there's always a first. Wow, I really messed up buying apple stock right before GUIs took over. Wow, I really messed up buying Apple stock before laptops outpaced desktops. Wow I really messed up buying Apple stock right before personal mp3 players took off. Wow, I really messed up buyiny Apple stock right before smart phones took off. LolNow I'm supposed to think some day I'll say "wow I really messed up buying Apple stock right before AI/VR/AR converged"That's a calculated risk I'm willing to take.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:09:03'] Ugh.  My son has quest. His friends have it.  It got old fast for all of them    They play Xbox. PlayStation switch and laptops much more    Who knows done the road If they can make the experience on a light pair of sunglasses ? Maybe.   Forget the helmet for 3500
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:29:44'] Buy the rumor sell the news.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:19:07'] They always crash after their stupid shows.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:10:31'] Usually the opposite of what is expected happens. AAPL will be fine
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:22:33'] Starting at $3499 next year. Not quite the message we wanted to hear about Apple’s augmented reality.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:37:18'] AAPL does what it wants, when it wants. They’ll be the king of AI when Tim Apple is good and ready.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:18:19'] OP, you gonna have to do better than 0.15%.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:24:08'] Taking another companies idea and making it better is kinda what Apple does best though. PC, smart phone, tablets, watch. This will be another winner for them
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:02:10'] Lmao people who bash VR (note not AR) as a bad investment are so short sighted. As someone using it everyday it’s like reading comments about the internet in 1992 where the news segments are laughing at notion the infant WWW would result in anything significant. If you know someone with a meta quest go ask to play thrill of the fight (a $10 game) and experience getting your fucking ass kicked in a single 3 round fight in less than 10 minutes. You will be dripping with sweat throwing haymakers in an immersive simulated boxing match, and the best part is it’s insanely FUN. I’ve lost 20 pounds literally because of a video game lmao, with 0 changes to my diet. Every person I have shown my VR headset two are amazed by it. Once the triple AAA companies start making games it will the future vr will play a major role in video games. It’s is the ultimate immersive  experience for games. And video games are only a fraction of the potential revenue streams. In the next 10 years the NFL and NBA will be selling monthly subscription options to watch games in VR from a court side seats perspective. The nfl I promise you, will put cameras on qb helmets to give you in the moment feel of a game from the qbs perspective. VR has so many potential options for revenue, sports and video games are just the obvious start.TLDR you are being a dumb dumb if you think VR is a fad. It’s new, it’s not perfect, but holy shit go use one and you will understand. It’s like the first time you used an iPhone and got that “yeah… this is the future” feeling. I promise you, two of the 7 biggest companies in the world are not investing billions in the space without the due diligence, and more importantly foresight, to see where VR is 5 to 10 years from now. It has the potential to be their flagship product.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:01:39'] I actually think the headset will be worth it for those that work at home. Bigger workspace, ability to change. There is a reason all those fancy shows use that kind of thing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:06:52'] You wonder who’s actually going to pay $3500 for this headset. Why don’t I just spend maybe half that for a nice huge OLED tv?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 12:19:56'] I’m glad I bought puts at $184 lol. You can always count on apple to release a disappointing, overly expensive product.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:59:25'] I have not read all the comments, but I had a good laugh when they showed the Apple Silicone MacPro. „Look. You get the same M2 everyone gets. Remember the thousands of dollars you spent on that Intel rig? It’s completely obsolete, but this now.“Apple Chips are impressive but I have not and probably never will buy a mac that is obsolete in two years because Apple iterates their silicon to artificially fast track product cycles. Nope. I love myself an iPhone but I will not spend money on iPads and macs that in theory have the same performance, but are limited due to cooling, form factors etc.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:40:43'] What APPLE just did is GENIUS. They basicaly got free advertising by saying that their VR would cost 3500 and people are gonna talk about it a lot plus they are inflating their price to make the brand more “luxurious” and “prestigious” just by pumping the VR price to a very high price point. They did it well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:44:47'] Seriously though, what about eye health? Why is it not discussed?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:45:13'] A whooooole ass $0.20 down!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:45:51'] While I was listening to Tim Apple and his fellows, I was wondering how much it will cost. I thought 5k. Maybe I am not even wrong, as they said starts at 3,5k. With this price point it will be niche product
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 14:46:04'] To all the regards here.I'd watch myself trying to short a behemoth that has 55 billion in cash on hand at almost all times.   Primarily in tax havens.Good luck To All.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:47:09'] Intel is down 4%
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:47:52'] IMO Apple did the opposite of pulling a Meta.  They delivered on the right direction for the product category and didn't bet the whole company on it.  Meta is sort of flailing around with their vision for the future.  Apple seemingly nailed a starting point that looks impressive as hell.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:52:18'] I think people underestimate augmented reality. It's coming whether you like it or not. It's the next computer. The next phone. The same friction was present during the launch of iPhone.

If anything, it's designed more for people who actually have a real woman in their room to be able to pull up a virtual projection of the same stock info on their monitor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 13:41:56'] I think people are really underestimating how big ar/vr will be in next 5-10 years. Just think about how many things your smart phone made obsolete- alarm clock, Dictionary, e-reader, newspaper, music player/walkman,  addressbook, compass and many other things. Similarly ar/vr could make things like tv, monitors and even your smart phone obsolete. Alot of people are too focused on large form factor but it will eventually get to a point where its just the size of your normal glasses. Price will also come down. The entertainment aspect is already huge in ar/vr, gaming in 3d world, watching 3d movies is alot better on ar/vr headset than traditional screen.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 15:56:54'] Can we all admit the Vision Pros scream something fishy. (not like your step sis)They show all this stuff. Hide the cord (don't even talk about it) and then they say, oh this won't be out till next year.... So you're saying Apple hasn't fully fleshed it out yet. That alone should make everyone question this.   I know they will produce it (unless it doesn't sell at all, I doubt that though), but I'm thinking of betting it will not be on schedule. I'd also bet this thing will have more issues than expected. And I'll even go a step further and say, it's not going to sell well. $3500 is steep. The more I thought about it, I'm shocked AAPL didn't hit 175. This WWDC would scare the shit out of me if I was a AAPL shareholder.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 10:29:23'] Regardless of what you think of VR or the metaverse, Apple's headset is leaps and bounds ahead of its competitors. Additionally, Meta tried to make VR and the metaverse the new direction of the company, while Vision Pro isn't expected to make much of a dent for revenue as Apple sticks to iPhone and Services as it's money maker and growth opportunities.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 07:48:24'] That’s cuz LBGTI month, Tim Apple pride 🌈🏳️‍🌈
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 13:15:05'] Meta sucked because it was attached to Zuckerberg. Apple products are at least innovative, even if they suck. This is a suped up version of a type of product that’s been around since virtual boy. Whether or not it goes the way of 3D tvs? Who’s to say? I do think that at a price point of (starting at?!) $3,500 it’s not gonna sell a lot and Apple might take a bath on it. Not even mentioning the inherent problems that will arise when reality sets in for the early adopters who buy the stuff and find flaws or limitations. “The cord sticks out of one side and it’s too short. The battery gets too hot. The lens gets foggy when I sweat. I got drunk when I was wearing it and passed out in it and now the widget thing is broken. I dropped it and now xyz doesn’t work. My boss FaceTimed me while I was watching porn.”I have a feeling there’s gonna be some interesting things that come out of its rollout. Idk if average people are going to save up 3 months rent to shell out on a potentially fragile AF device. They’re gonna have to sell 1m units to make back the costs and they’re gonna have to rely on other divisions of devices to float them for a while.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 08:33:20'] Zuckerborg should take some marketing classes from Tim ~~Apple~~ Cook. First and foremost: He should never again appear in any marketing material. His perception by the general public as a slimy, untrustworthy lizardman is firmly set in stone. Idgaf if he's the CEO, he needs to find another public face (giggity) for the company. But hey, I'm pretty sure his ego would cause his head to implode if anyone ever told him straight to his face "Bro you're a charisma black hole."

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:36:08'] I think Apple is grasping at straws here trying to enter new areas because they realize in that phones will become like tvs in the next few years. By this I mean nobody cares if it’s a Samsung or Sony they just care about price. While apples iOS system works well for phones unless they can find a way to keep making there phones stand out I think slowly competitors will chip away at there moat as they are able to make cheaper phones that are comparable. Once there phone sales drop down there App Store revenue will follow and that will begin there downward trajectory.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:22:43'] There is an issue with this AR goggles that wasn’t brought up by Apple in their marketing video.  Humidity fog will develop on the screen because of the sealed design.  How will they keep it dry?  It needs to have active ventilation which could create unwanted noise.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 03:21:59'] I think Apple will release a budget version vision SE , the budget one will not have the expensive oled screen that shows the face , it’s not really necessary , glass would be very heavy ( if it’s real glass) maybe around $2000 and use more plasticky . Apple def has advanced hardware than Meta headset but it’s not Meta not capable of making this , Meta’s goal is creating Metaverse for everybody , and quest 2 is already very successful.What makes the Apple VR interesting is the chips apple designed and the OS , I see the stock ticks up when it talks about these , looks like Apple is determined to invest large in VR .

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 04:38:23'] There is enough money out there which already has bought in every new apple product no matter the price tag.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 05:31:14'] The irony is that the price tag is a good thing for Apple. It means this is a low volume product that they aren’t betting the farm on (unlike Meta). They are committed to growing this capability but are going to do it hand in hand with developers so that when they are ready to release a $500 pair of sunglasses in a few years at mass, the ecosystem will be ready.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 05:39:44'] It means fucking nothing. The markets have become so skittish and oversensitive to „news“ with all the meme nonsense and lemming „investors“. Going back to the good old buy-and-hold of quality shares - like Apple - is the only sane way through this phase.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 07:33:56'] The assessment that VR/AR goggles only have applications in porn is weak. Although there will probably be a high demand related to immersive entertainment experiences where comparable alternatives have high price tags, there are also applications in science and industry.  I'd estimate about 50,000 units sell to US industry alone in the first year based on lagging indicators and a growing demand for remote capabilities as employers continue to compete for the best workers by providing the most accommodating working conditions.  Major caveat- they provide the level of standards and back end support Apple is known for.  If they aren't ready to screen and onboard applications compatible with the product this is going to shit the bed.

So two straight quarters with negative y/y growth.It has a PE of 30 but it’s not a growth stock - I think the only thing the market sees in it is possible huge growth from India and huge cash flow which has gone into share buy backs.For these reason I am also short APPL - currently short 60 shares at $172 and adding more shorts as it continues up.

There is NOTHING they dont have their hands in.  They are their own bank for fuck sake. The long term gain tax will be very nice However I do have one exception. It's a stock I bought about the same time as Apple originally.MVIS some of my apple shares went to this. A decade of waiting and riding this ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 15 CENTS is about to pay off huge. 10x AINT NOTHIN when this one hits. I've bought a crap load more along the way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 21:55:31'] The Apple party will end someday.I took a look at the earnings report. Q1 2023 vs. Q2 2023 is a bit unfair when Q1 includes December 2022. Stagnant net profit margins (-.1%) quarter over quarter. \~1% operating margin decrease quarter over quarter. $600 million increase in inventories. For a more representative situation, Apple compares Q2 2023 vs. Q2 2022 and overlooks a 2.5% decrease in revenue (-$2.4 billion) and 3.4% decrease in profits (-$850 million). Profit margin fell by -.23%. EPS misleads with the same $1.52 as last year. Profits dropped. Let's see what happens for the rest of the year to make the final call, but the media hype around Apple is questionable.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 07:27:01'] I think the real lesson here is that phones are required equipment for daily life, and the networks subsidize the iPhone enough that people can access it. A lot of people only have a phone for internet and entertainment, so you could think of it as being economical to buy one nice device that you use for everything, even if you don’t have a lot of money for other things.

Since then I’ve seen what is it up to now 13? 14? And I’m like… what’s the difference?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 13:42:48'] Apple is purposely not giving future guidance here.  I think the economic condition warranted this.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 19:06:28'] There is a very real possibility that the First Republic could collapse in the near future. This would be due to rampant government spending and inflation, as well as Apple's potential recession. Everything else seems fine at the moment, but if these things come to pass then it could spell disaster for the economy. The national debt would balloon out of control and SVB PacWest's looming collapse would only make matters worse.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-12 18:40:42'] All joking aside, can you at least pull $10k out so you’re family doesn’t get stuck with your burial bills. You’re trying to short AAPL on the same day that Warren Buffett just reinforced his interest in AAPL which just so happens to be his greatest trade of all time. I wouldn’t even yolo these puts in a papertrade account just outta respek.

Do not be so selfish to punish them even more than you already have. Do not lose this bet then quit on your family. How selfish of you. Get your shit together and be a man for once. The only way out of this is for you to own the consequences and start working towards a solution. Anything else is not fair for your children. Do not screw them.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 17:51:21'] God damn, these comments are ruthless. Dude is talking about clocking out. Bro, stop throwing money at shit WSB talks about. Long term wealth isn’t made this way.

So here you go...This was a terrible decision. YOLOing DTE3 puts with the last of your money is a terrible idea after being down over $150K. So maybe this will help to make Apple drop a least a few bucks tomorrow to get those puts ITM to double, triple or better your money so you'll be right back up there again. Did I mention this is pure gambling?There. I've done my best to help.

Rounded to the nearest 1 million people, there will probably be approximately 0 people in the world who will want to strap some goofy gadget on their face on a regular basis regardless of how amazing the experience will be. Zero. High-end gamers might be interested. Remote surgeons might be interested. But not the average consumer. That might change one day, but I doubt it'll start soon after WWDC 2023.And no... bad bitches will not want to wear Apple Glasses. They're more interested in dressing up in dominatrix outfits and squishing your testicles with their sexy high heels while you scream the safe word.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 12:54:44'] they actually aren't comparable. Microsoft's holographic display is something totally different that uses light prisms to display objects in 3d space using kinect-like room-mapping algorithms. Apple doesn't try to do any of that it's just a VR display with an opaqueness setting. Also microsoft already sold thousands of units to the military for research and testing in mixed reality combat training. I'll reserve judgement on which approach is better until Vision Pro comes out but Hololens is firmly "pro" product and apple's is sorta "prosumer."

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 05:40:00'] That's the thing though - this is the 'pro' headset. And the use cases, and introduction/presentations, are all targeted at professional sectors - not consumer/home users. There will probably be a cheaper consumer/home user version later on, but it's blatently advertised to commercial sectors.&#x200B;But not the same commercial sectors hololens targets. And not even remotely the same capabilities/platform/software/etc. Hololens is a full W10/11 computer in the headset with all that entails - from management to software capabilities etc. Apple's is an iPad strapped to your head. &#x200B;Also, try mounting apple's on a hardhat well in a construction/industrial area.... we use hololenses in one business unit to inspect steel panels for ship construction, for example. &#x200B;Apple's is just Hololens 2 with a few tweaks and far less software capabilites - sure, maybe a bit more sensor and display resolution, but the display is entirely different and suits different purposes. &#x200B;But apple is definitely not targeting consumers with this one. Will it be used by consumers? Sure, the same way I use my hololens like a consumer product (just with far more useful software). Will that be a minority? hell yes. Will it be able to entirely replace my work computer like a hololens does and give me unlimited screen real estate and the ability to leave software and other things in different rooms (I've forgotten which room i've left SSH sessions in before, lol.....) and let me do the same work? Well, if you can do everything for work on an iPad without remoting to another machine to run applications (not say, configure a server and/or push/run test scripts), then yes. Otherwise, hell no.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:52:42'] Common people mislead Apple Vision Pro with an AR/VR headset, that needs to have separate computing unit. I see it more as wearable computer, so price wise is not bad.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 13:17:13'] The difference is, before Apple vision pro I’d never heard of HoloLens. Brand recognition and marketing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 15:02:28'] Book value is kinda meaningless to software companies. You can have software that everyone wants to license or subscribe to, but the "book" value is basically 0, since it's not a "real" asset. Apple also has a lot of value in its brand which isn't reflected in book value either.You can probably buy a real estate company that's like 1-to-1 book to stock price, but that just means its value is the sum of its holdings. Doesn't mean you should invest in it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:58:38'] Book value isn't a very useful metric for software heavy companies. Imagine a pure software company. Their book value is some laptops and some servers and some chairs and a refrigerator. But the software sells well and the margins are very high, because once you have the software written, costs to sell one more copy is almost zero. So the company has value based on the revenue and profits and almost no value based on stuff it owns. Apple has a huge software component in its valuation.

You have no legal ownership of the underlying company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 18:57:41'] A bunch of highly regarded people in here that can't read a balance sheet nor a cash flow statement. Forget all that rubbish about software companies having a low book value. Book value is primarily impacted by three things: net income, share issuance, and capital return.Apple's BVPS keeps falling because of the buyback. Just look at their Common Stock line item and their retained earnings. When Apple repurchases shares, that common stock falls by (0.00001 + issuance price) * shares repurchased. The retained earnings falls by the (price paid per share repurchased - issuance price - 0.00001) * shares repurchased. Retained earnings also falls due to Apple's dividend.Retained earnings = Previous period RE + Net Income - Dividends - Preferred Dividends - Share repurchases. Apple does $100 bn in net income, buys back $90 bn in stock, and pays out $15 bn in dividends. If they didn't return capital to shareholders, you would see their book value skyrocket by $100 bn. Apple will have a negative book value if they keep returning all cash generated to shareholders.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 15:08:18'] AAPL is not a good value by this metric, but there is more involved in valuing a company than price/book ratio. There are a lot of good companies that have a lower price/book than BABA too. I personally put a lot of weight on that when picking a stock to hold long term. Definitely not the only factor though

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:57:08'] I mean I'm seeing a book value of 386 on baba. Which would be even more absurd. And no I didn't miss a decimal point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 15:26:14'] Book value is physical goods. BABA sells sh\*t so they have a ton of stuff they can liquidate. Apple on the other hand have patents and stuff in a holding or the app store so there's no physical value on these but it doesn't mean they don't make a ton of money. Book value is absolutely bad to measure companies against each other it's more for specific types of companies where it makes sense.Imagine you sell paintings. The book value of a painting is the frame, paper and colors that you can still sell for scrap or on a flee market but the Mona Lisa is worth way more even if the book value is probably less than $100.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 16:58:45'] Ignoring the China aspect, this is basically the cliffnotes version of Benjamin Graham and early Warren Buffett. If you buy a stock that's priced lower than it's real value, it's almost certainly going to rise at some point.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 16:55:49'] No one values a company for their current fixed assets and investment portfolios. They care much more about the ability to generate growing free cash flows. The cash flows either get paid to the shareholders or spent to increase the company’s assets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 17:21:01'] Retail businesses aren't worth much more than their inventory, aside from potentially logistics and real estate.Technology companies have troves of copyrights and patents, which are free recurring revenue.Intellectual property and brand value are explicitly not part of book value---and AAPL has both.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 17:58:36'] Absolutely not correct. Book value is historical cost accounting of assets not fair values.  BABA may/probably has a lot of impaired assets as well that should be written down. The intellectual property and DCF of AAPL are worth way more than the sum of its tangible assets on its books, and that results in its stock price. Stick to mutual funds dude.

For example, LUMEN and PACW are trading at ridiculous P/B values of less than 0.3 iirc. Obviously there is a reason for the low P/B and its that investors are worried for one reason or another.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 05:19:58'] Why would I spend more on an M2 MacBook Air when the M1 is more than powerful enough, ridiculously cheap, and if you can get one from their refurb section, even cheaper. Steve Jobs came back and slashed a ton of their product line. Since he’s been gone, the increased lineup creep is coming back, innovation is down, and the software is absolute piss. Look at the latest iteration of macOS. Pure crap. They took the vertically developed iPadOS and seemingly tried to squish it into a horizontal space. The settings app is by far the worse thing on the Mac I’ve seen in forever. It’s buggy and everything is everywhere. We went from 1 phone to 3, plus previous models still available. We went from 1 Apple Watch to 3. We went from 1 iPad to….3?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 04:33:37'] I normally wouldn't care but AAPL gave some pretty positive guidance for Q1. This puts a dent in that and makes me much more skeptical of Q1.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 14:29:05'] Here’s something to think about:The M2 Processor is just absolute gold. I have a 17 inch M1 Max based MacBook Pro and holy shit it’s just a monster. Absolutely FLIES with Premiere Pro / Adobe CC, FL Studio is amazing, the battery life is astoundingly good, and the processor is ARM based so scaling down and up was the core design philosophy.MacBook Air’s are insanely OP for their form factor now, the GPU cores and hardware support for rendering media files makes my Threadripper setup so underpowered… Oh, and iPad Pro’s with M1’s are the damn same. All day battery but super smooth graphics at 120fps, crazy thin form factors… Mark my words, the AR headset is coming simply because Apple realized they could with the ARM efficiency their new processor design offers. Latency and CPU/GPU handoffs are crazy optimized and every single store in my area recommends Apple Mx-based laptops and tablets for like practically anyone shopping nowadays. I’m a very big fan of Ryzen’s competition but Apple quietly nuked Intel and AMD in the areas that matter most: Laptops.Sales are ALWAYS slow for PC’s post Christmas and Black Friday / Cyber Monday. Anyone who didn’t upgrade then is most likely happy where they are since PC’s aren’t that much faster YoY compared to the 2000’s and late 90’s. My 1080Ti still kicks absolute ass with a mild OC but I barely use it anymore because MacBook M1 Max absolutely demolishes it, taking less than 5 minutes on average for a render job that can take an hour easily on my desktop.Considering how long most Apple users keep their laptops, plus Rosetta 2 barely even making a dent for x64-86 non-native software support, Apple would be king of these numbers excluding the fact that HP / Dell MINT money on lazy businesses that don’t want or need to have premium devices for their wage sla-… err, workers.There’s a reason Apple is basically worth more than bank stocks for long term YoY growth because they don’t need to “innovate” by cramming half baked features. They refine ideas into products that people get tangible results from.Edit: I’ll bet my hat that Apple’s VR / AR goggles will use cut down versions of their M-Line processors with more GPU cores and less CPU cores for thermal headroom, reliable frame time and frame rate, as well as processing all the data into a wireless, self computing setup. Basically, do what HoloLens promised but better.

The only useful thing this does is media viewing, which other headsets already do for a fraction of the cost. If eye tracking and hand gestures prove to be popular, then people will just start integrating them into normal desktop setups with cameras that attach to your monitor.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:21:11'] It feels like one of those really cool proof of concepts that you see at CES that never actually makes it to market. Yes it's cool...but not practical yet. It has a 2 hour battery life. This is considered acceptable because it's also heavy and not comfortable to wear on your face for a long time. One of the things they spent the most time showing off is how it's great to just sit back and watch a movie. If it's not comfortable enough to wear for a long time and the battery is less than 90% of movies being release now days then the primary entertainment use case is gone. Using it as a a multi monitor office is also not practical...other VR products have tried it. There are definitely some cool concepts in it but it's not there yet...and 90% of the cool stuff is available in other VR products.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 02:05:40'] Because mobile phones (apples bread and butter) are a mature market with not much room to advance with current tech Desktop refresh cycles are getting longer due to lack of need for higher compute And VR is a budding industry but if we compare it to phones it's still in the early 90s not the early 2010s so the massive explosion in profits aren't likely to manifest now if ever Apple is very very highly valued especially compared to other companies so your buying high expecting it to go higher and it might but also could fall alot further 🤷🏻‍♂️
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 13:04:59'] Yeah, $3500 for a product that has not *proved* anything it claims to deliver is definitely the way forward!!1!Hype your stupidity as much as you want, [it's not making price turn around any time soon](https://i.imgur.com/Gvu7QzL.png).Apple's real market is USA and China. USA because, well, USA. Buying overpriced junk to fit in with the crowd is just tradition there. And China is ironically very much like USA on that matter. In addition to that, Tim Cook is in bed with CCP (maybe literally), and has happily handed over not only user data, but entire data centers to be controlled by CCP officials. On top of that, when CCP so commands, Apple pulls apps from its store, which Hong Kong protestors were using to coordinate their events.Apple will make money because it's more depraved than most depraved companies out there. Not because they slapped a moronic price on a moronic fad that went nowhere, after years of hype.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:47:24'] Apple is a different type of company. They do things in their own way. They reward shareholders with Buybacks. They have a healthy cash balance. They pioneer platforms and collect shady fees from developers. This shit is going to be legendary. It doesn't matter that some people will hate it. The potential for new and immersive experiences will be unleashed by Apple. The possibilities in gaming, education, home office spaces and porn alone will take apple to the fucking moon. While everyone was losing their shit over a semi useful AI chatbot, Apple did what Apple does. Make expensive shit that everyone wants to buy. Again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 12:57:29'] >There are a few reasons why you shouldn't invest everything you have into Apple stock. First, no company is immune to market fluctuations and there is always the potential for Apple's stock price to go down. Second, investing all of your money in one company leaves you vulnerable if that company experiences financial difficulties. Finally, diversifying your investments helps protect against losses in any single investment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 15:01:43'] TL;DR AAPL is getting hyped for the wrong reasons despite raising the bar on VR technologies. They're instead a strong company backed by major financial institutions and have continued to build a robust and exclusive technology ecosystem.&#x200B;Is AAPL bullish? Yes.Is it entirely because of VR? No.There's too much information and history pointing to VR being a flop. It's a technology that is worth developing but it's just *not quite there yet*. Again, AAPL hasn't cracked the code on this... yet.I say yet, because they actually have a strong shot at taking this technology to the next level, and the reason why is because of their steady focus on size reduction, aesthetic and face tracking technology. We use our faces to express ourselves, this is a major stumbling block in VR where while it may be entertaining, there's still the ever-present feeling that you're either in costume or hanging out with a bunch of puppets. Size and aesthetic are just a given, the current headsets on the market look ridiculous and uncool.Apple is also arguably better at monetization than Facebook has been, and I strongly believe that metaverse developers will step up their game to meet any extra demand brought on by AAPL products, which will increase competition and enrich the community. If you look at the situation as an economist, we all know monopolies aren't efficient in the long run. We need more players in the game like AAPL to spur on further innovation.Despite all that, that's still not the reason AAPL is bullish in my book. Apple has continued to deepen its ties to financial technology and offers a card backed by Goldman Sachs, the second largest bank *in the world.* Goldman Sachs is a titan in the financial industry and has backing from some of the most elite supporters such as Blackrock and Vanguard.The apple card that I mentioned above is made all the more useful with its integration through apple pay, this might not sound like a major innovation but it's a strong addition to the Apple ecosystem of technology from a business standpoint. Apple earns money on interest paid on these cards, which will likely provide small but stable profit for years to come.Does this lead me to believe that AAPL is a rocket? No. But I do still have confidence in them to stay in some sort of weird area between being a value and a growth stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-17 03:28:57'] "Silicon shield" - China relies on TSM to produce 70% of their chips, if they invade Taiwan they would be fucking themselvesWithout a doubt, the first Chinese bomb or rocket that should fall on the island would make the supply chain impact of the COVID pandemic seem like a mere hiccup in comparison. As the world’s leading trading country, the Chinese economy would be the biggest loser, but the impact would be global.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 18:40:57'] He apparently sold it due to "Geopolitical exposure." Let's say you think the risk of China invading Taiwan is less than 1%. It's probably still good to sell the stock, because that 1% risk of it being worth nothing isn't worth modest gains.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-06 15:01:07'] I haven’t traded AAPL in a long time, but the rule used to be, when everyone is hyping it up, that’s when you sell. Maybe not buy puts, but go to cash. Like, when the rhetoric gets extreme - they can do no wrong, the valuation will go over a trillion bucks (this was a while back), Tim Cook is from an alien civilization that perfected supply chain science, etc. Get out of the stock. Then when the rhetoric goes to the other extreme - rumors of a Samsung/Google phone that will eat Apple’s lunch, rumors of Foxconn factories shutting down, rumors of Gen Z kids thinking Apple’s not cool, etc. When it gets to the extreme of AAPL’s about to go bankrupt and everyone is bearish - then buy, because the stock is about to rip. Dunno if that guidance holds true anymore… but the OP makes me immediately bearish.

TBH, I will probably be buying iPhones for as long as they make them and so will the other hundreds of millions of people around the world.  There are just too many avenues they could go down to monopolize on the next decade long trend and long term, declines in the stock price are just that, an opportunity to start/add to your position.

However, it's important to remember that the stock market is unpredictable, and even the most experienced investors can get it wrong sometimes. With that in mind, I think it's wise to do your own research and make your own decisions when it comes to investing. That being said, Apple does look like it could be a good bet for the near future, so it might be worth considering if you're looking for a good investment opportunity.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 15:43:20'] >This is definitely a case of "buy the rumour, sell the news." The reason being that there is so much hype surrounding this event, and it's likely that Apple will not be able to live up to all the expectations. So, while the stock may go up in anticipation of WWDC, once the actual event happens and people realize that reality doesn't match up with their expectations, the stock will come crashing down.

Government intervention on how Apple should run their store is like government intervention on how Target or Walmart should run their store. Isn’t that what conservatives cry about all the time? To not allow government interference with the free market? I guess Elon Musk and every conservative is a communist then. I’m just going by their logic.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 12:54:07'] Twitter needs Apple, Apple doesn't need Twitter, just like it didn't need Fortnite. Elon can't win this, he's fucking delusional.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 12:54:50'] Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon tried to disrupt the smartphone iOS/Android duopoly and failed. I get it, Elon disrupted the auto industry but smartphones are arguably a lot more sticky than cars from a consumer perspective. Anything that’s only marginally better than iOS or Android probably wouldn’t be worth the hassle. He’ll also probably take Tesla’s best people while their brand and quality decline.

Do you have any idea how much debt Elon went into to buy twitter ($13 billion), only to run it into the ground  and destroy it in less than a month?  The funny thing about Apple users is they don't like fucking around with external sites or bullshit like this. They have money and would rather pay the $3 themselves than deal with the hassle. The other funny thing about Apple is...again, they own over 55% of the mobile phone market.  So yeah I think Apple will be OK. Elon is like Trump 2.0. Totally full of shit and a his entire image is based off a series of lies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 16:25:14'] For anyone curious on the outcome, precedent has been set that either A. Elon has to pay apple 30% which at $8 loses him money on every sale from lost ad rev or B. Can provide but not advertise paying online on the twitter website ($2 profit per purchase at $8)In either scenario precedent says that apple can pull the app off their store any time they want, including if they try to pull and Epic and refuse to not pay apple which if that happens, Twitter turns into the largest loss on buyout since Yahoo bought Tumbler.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 15:07:08'] May be something is there in FT's article. Reuters is reporting that U.S. officials assessing possible 'manipulation' on banking shares. Something is happening. Banking crisis 3.0 like you said yesterday is in full swing. If would be interesting to see if Apple says AI. Irony is they were not invited to the White House meeting.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 19:17:15'] So calmly stepping back from the noise, what do we see?The KRE direction is obvious. Almost too obvious in the short term. XLE, XLF down are similarly too obvious.The defensive sectors were a mixed bag today.If you loooked in the squirrelly corners of XLF the REITs were fighting back hard.  So was BTC and thus crypto stocks.Conclusion.The market is not fully yet terrified of risk, and the weak areas are due for relief.So we could bounce on hard-hammered sectors where shorts are overweight. Crypto goes up until we hit or even slightly surpass the recent highs.After that, we go down. CTAs are nearly max out on buys. They won't add liquidity. I really don't see the logic and liquidity for a rapid wave of corp share  buybacks. Even the Treasury is nearing the end of pouring liquidity into markets. Any big player scared by the bitcoin slamming recently, and wanting dry powder for what comes next, sells into that rally.There really is only one source of liquidity left, other than the last dregs of retail money. And that would be if big money becomes scared enough of the debt battle that they decide money would be safer in high-grade corp bonds and securities than agency paper... and for the latter, frankly, they would do better internationally which weakens the dollar and adds pressure on the Fed to maintain rates.So faced with two questions:1. What will the market do in 1-3 days?2. What will the market do in 1-3 weeks?the first is always hard to answer. The second though, we're running out of ways for the swan song not to sound. Once either the CTAs start to sell, and doubly so when the debt ceiling is resolved/deferred and Treasury reduces liquidity by restoring its usual asset positioning, this market is effed with a razor-wired baseball bat inserted sideways and rotated.And yeah, tough market today. Picked up 1% on an options play for XLE that I held a little too long (could have been closer to 3%). But I wasn't willing to let it sag and risk the overnight, I just wasn't in it deep enough to have any margin of safety.

I’m almost ready to accept that it’s not a technical disconnect, that it’s not being suppressed (wouldn’t ~~MM~~ *somebody* lose their ass on options if they were actively underpricing volatility?) and that the VIX futures traders just know something we all don’t…I bought the dip on regional banks with DPST calls as soon as the WAL FT story was retracted. I’m feeling a bit nervous about the play though, with the current price and 3x leverage, we’re potentially looking at an ETF crashing moment if more bad news rolls in. Maybe I’m too optimistic about regulators and the administration, but I cannot make myself believe Treasury department will not make market rocking moves like insuring all deposits, suspending short selling, immediately buying back all treasuries at par. I think I’m just going to say “fuck it” and let my gambling portfolio blow up if the market moves against me. Or who knows, maybe my long volatility plays will make up for the regional bank plays. I know there was some bad news about PARA streaming and insurers are looking risky right now. But I was surprised how little AAPL earnings moved BRK.B. Maybe it was “priced in”.Well, I’m going to lose a chunk if UVXY doesn’t hit $5 tomorrow. With all the posturing out of Russia yesterday, this debt ceiling stalemate is concerning. The prospect of US default is minuscule, but it’s not 0% and that is concerning. Enough of my rambling. Good luck tomorrow.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 15:32:14'] I work in electronics manufacturing, surface mount to be specific. Currently we have components (1206-09 caps) which previously were a fraction of a cent being purchased for $0.50 each! We have a huge amount of integrated circuits we are now purchasing for 500%+ of their price last year, and we literally can not source enough of many more specialized components even still with the current supply chain situation vastly improving. As an example there is a specific component I recall noticing this week. It’s only a simple fine pitch S08, we have purchased it 3 times. The first two times it cost us between $1-2 per unit, our most recent PO was $53 per unit. That is more than a 2,500% increase in cost. It is currently available with a 16 week lead time  on Digikey (retailer) for less than 2 dollars, however if we ended up needed some sooner than 4-8 months we would again pay out the ass for it.There is one particular component we use, this is a prefabricated small PCBA. It’s actually a substitution for a different pcba which we have not been able to source. This particular alternate we have had immense difficulty sourcing, and often the supplier will have some in stock but deliver it to a different customer even though we had placed our order earlier.In the current supply chain/manufacturing system there are immense difficulties sourcing more specialized components, however this is pay to play meaning something which may be essentially not available at a moderately inflated price is likely going to be able to be sourced for a huge price tag. If you do successfully place an order you may have an ETA of 1-24 months out which will often be repeatedly delayed, many times a PO will only be partially delivered piecemeal over the course of weeks or monthsApple is likely trying very hard to meet this project deadline, it doesn’t matter if the initial production runs are losing them money because they would lose much more by not bringing it to market in an acceptable time scale.Once they build up their stock of the components used and have less of an urgent need to absolutely get their orders in on time they will likely be able to produce this product for exponentially less cost for the materials. And keep in mind for a surface mount line as Apple uses a huge amount of the expense is in the equipment not the material, and this equipment has a usable lifespan of ~5-10 years maximum.Given the immensely inflated cost to get components in a timely manner you can likely expect this assembly to cost less than $200 in materials within the next 2 years once Apple’s stock is adequately built up and their suppliers have acclimated to the demand.Tl;dr the total cost of the BOM is $2k or whatever now, but only because they need it all right now. On a more relaxed timeline it could be much much less.

The World Cup, The Olympics, Holidays and celebrations in other countries. \n\nOffice professionals and those who use multi screen setups now have an office on the go, in one product. \n\nNew companies that create pure for your entertainment experiences will start up. Youll be to experience out of this world things, like flying to another planet, exploring new worlds. See what the Earth was like when it was just dinosaurs and wildl'

This could get a freak flood  from crap banks and unbanked into iphone as a bank. Making overnight, Apple one of the biggest most integrated and well accepted fintech payments processor.that is some heavy stuff looking long from here, not to be overhype, but it could be a 2-7yr multiX price vs share with forward splits expected, potential spinoff and massive uptick in cash volume plus user/fee base. It's crazy enough for a movie plot.IRL, I use android because I don't like having a phone master i have to pay for my own shit. Trade wise, fk it, near term volatility is profit, and obvious growth long is easy value.\*\*edit, derped out and forgot extended contextGoldman Sachs is doing the banking for Apple, Goldman just announced step back from retail/consumer banking. It is almost conspiracy good timing for the perfect bridge to shadow bank it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 16:34:03'] Yea. But realize that out of China does not automatically mean back to the United States.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 15:14:12'] I've done work in China for years, primarily in manufacturing and anti-countefeiting. Which, as you might imagine, are somewhat related (think factory leaks).It's astounding how many companies are now thinking of diversifying manufacturing outside of China, or leaving it altogether, when less than a decade ago it was the first place you'd look. But even outside of the disruptions caused by Zero Covid, the CCP has become increasingly hostile to both domestic and foreign private enterprise, and seems more concerned with consolidating power back in Beijing. There's been a huge breach of trust and there may be no going back.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 22:20:01'] I read an article (either from the WSJ or NYT, their logo fonts are way too similar) mentioning that an analyst at Apple determined that there wasn't another country in the world that could supply the manufacturing efficiency of China. I wonder if that has changed or if Apple is ready to take a production hit.Either way, this is a good thing. "Don't put all of your eggs in one basket" is common sense. And yet many businesses are ridiculously dependent on China. Finding a good pair of prescription glasses not made in China is fucking difficult.

POST_TEXT: b'I saw a post the other day about some analyst saying now is a prime time for Apple to acquire DIS. While I know that Apple completely acquiring DIS is out of the question, but the launch of the vision pro gives apple a huge opportunity in the entertainment sector. I can see a huge upside for both companies if Apple and Disney reach some sort of deal with Disneys media portfolio and Apple TV+ to leverage the new headset. Since Disney is so down bad, I think it would make sense for Disney to be champing at the bit to enter some sort of symbiotic deal with Apple. Thoughts?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 06:56:03'] Disney could build their theme parks inside Vision Pro and then turn the real-world theme parks into parking lots and condominiums.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 06:37:18'] Your question is a little confusing.  Are you asking if AAPL should acquire a portion of Disney, or are you asking if AAPL should enter into a partnership with Disney?The former is probably a hard no.  Disney believes their media portfolio feeds into their parks, cruises, and merchandises.  I don't think DIS would sell any part of their portfolio.The latter is maybe possible.  Though I don't think people will buy a $3,500 VR headset to watch The Little Mermaid.  AAPL or DIS will need to invest in the technology to profit from it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 09:30:43'] the vision pro is not a cinema product.   the visions outlook and path will be decided in the next years. thats why they open its OS to developers now so that there will be content for the vision pro when released next year.   What the developers make out of the vision pros fantastic possibilities and what of those options will be liked and adapted by the buyers remains to be seen. when the path and use case of the vision pro is clear, we can talk again about this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 06:21:29'] >I think it would be a great move for Apple to acquire Disney.Disney has a lot of valuable assets that would complement Apple's existing business well. For example, Disney's media portfolio would give Apple a leg up in the content streaming wars, while its theme parks could help boostApple's brand image and appeal to families.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 12:00:44'] My opinion is I spent too much time reading your replies to people who spent too much time trying to calm you down.Regarding Apple, they’ve been in finance for a while. From Apple Pay to credit card to loans (business lines and personal). They’ve typically partnered with financial institutions to do it (Citizen Loan). Seems fine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-17 09:41:29'] ApplePay is already very much a thing, so I'm not quite sure where your banking analogy even comes from. It's just another I-item on their long list of items no different than SoFi investing or Hood IRA which seems to be what the current "trend" is. Personally l think AAPL is seriously overvalued, their products iffy, their services spotty and the entire company is just an accident waiting to happen, but as long as suckers keep buying the exact same shit every single year they have no fear of not making trillions a year. Enron was a completely different beast

It is gonna be long road to that though.

Or a Palm plantation in Malayisa, or a US construction company? Or how about a global Oil company? You can buy this and more in London.Our economy is not growth driven, more rent seeking now. Sorry if you have to start paying monthly to unlock your car HVAC features!All you have to do is look at how expensive it is to rent here. 5%-7% yield forever or double your money, in potentially 12 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:45:18'] This is a decent play. Not great, because you literally bought this near the high of the day, which is also near the 3 month high.I hope you make bank.The market may not moon, but I think over the next couple of weeks, you will likely come out ahead.  It's Apple.You've also given yourself sufficient time to get out of the contract and not lose all your capital. Best of luck !

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-02 15:03:29'] Have Apple ever dropped prices on existing products? I feel like their prices have only ever gone up, and perhaps they’ve reached unattainable levels for most people. I don’t recall them ever dropping prices ala Tesla.I was in the market for a new MacBook Pro, and the one that is equivalent in spec (bar CPU) to the one I could’ve bought the day before they were announced is a clear £400 more expensive. I ended up buying a refurbished gen one instead.Plenty of people simply aren’t going to be able to afford their stuff anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 14:26:23'] Apple is probably the last company you should bet against. No matter what happens they always beat the market expectations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 16:10:50'] Don't put a hard stop loss but please have a mental stop loss of around 25-30%. With the short amount of time you have, if you get to those levels it most likely won't recover due to time decay so it's better to cut at 30% Instead of letting it drop to 0. It'll be easier to get back to 10k with $7k vs with $0. Same for the upside, take some off the table at 30% gains and let more ride and keep trimming on the way up. Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 18:49:25'] I hope your right, I don't have any APPL,  but i believe you are gonna lose money. The market wont care much about this because it's already there. If you think about this extremely cold bloodedly, they could lose billions and still not get a drop in the bucket of what they have already saved on manufacturing. And again, very cold blooded but this won't last long in China, and unless it moves to a more general conflict, it may drop, and I hope it does for you, but idk if this would be a major reason

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 22:20:49'] Apple has too many jobs depending on it to drop. Literally employs entire companies indirectly through its App Store, and acquires other companies at such a fast rate. Their stock price doesn’t and won’t ever depend on how tf their stupid gadgets sell long term, they’re invested in facial recognition, software, and streaming services with a school issued ipad or Mac book in the hands of hundreds of thousands of American children.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 19:06:09'] Apple has a lot of cash for opportunistic stock buybacks.   It's due for a deep retrace but realize you have literally shorted the worlds most valuable and productive company.  Seeing huge downside moves will be more of the exception rather than the rule.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 19:17:21'] Wait. You just bet $10k against a company with the strongest balance sheet on Wall Street with Christmas season coming? I can’t wait to see these losses.

Without even considering the other top 99 companies, Apple alone is worth more than the entire FTSE100 companies combined. Your economy is a powerhouse of innovation, determination and worth ethic.\n\nYou enjoy globally dominated companies like Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Mastercard, Nvidia just to name a few. Mean while the UK has dog shit oil companies and banking companies on the verge of bankruptcy. I cannot remember the last time the UK produced a multi billon pound company. I think it was ARM Holdings, way back in 1990?\n\nSo my question is simply why can't the UK produce technological juggernauts like the US can? We have some of the best universities in the world yet we don't produce hardly any good companies.\n\nI just want to know why..."

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:21:32'] I've worked in tech at senior levels in the UK, and really the biggest obstacle in my view is funding.The UK is awful at funding tech companies, VCs are few and far between, and there's basically no funding $20M and up.It's hard to get innovative but expensive projects off the ground as a result.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:01:15'] >There are a few reasons why the UK doesn't produce as many tech juggernauts as the US. Firstly, the UK has a much smaller population than the US, so there's simply less room for growth. Secondly, the UK economy is more focused on services and finance than manufacturing and technology. And finally, Silicon Valley in California has been hugely successful in attracting top talent from around the world, while London (the closest equivalent in Europe) hasn't been able to replicate that success.

Military spending, agriculture subsidies,  innovation funding, welfare, police, common citizen relief services and more. The more you spend the more ways you can grow your economy despite what naysayers will say. Government spending = net good.5.) Routinely engage in world policing and nation building.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 20:46:38'] The US is basically a giant positive feedback loop of an economy. We have the most wealth, which means we can invest the most, which means the best talent comes here, which means we produce the most innovation, which means we create more wealth, which means we can invest more…Also, as far as universities… obviously Oxford and Cambridge are tier 1 world class, but the US has the entire Ivy League, plus technical schools like MIT, plus a bunch of top schools like Berkeley, Duke, Northwestern, Chicago, Georgetown, etc… and then on top of that each state has its own university system, each with multiple schools, each with their own research departments. And all of those schools do joint work with with the private sector and federal government.I’d also add the US military to the discussion. We spend something like a hundred billion per year on R&D just in defense spending. Obviously aerospace and ship building industries benefit the most, but there are still billions of dollars going into things like AI, material sciences, even biotech every year through the military.And then there is the global reserve currency benefit we enjoy, which helps facilitate trade deals.So, yeah, it’s just a giant positive feedback loop.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 20:24:44'] Probably all the extra regulations that old money companies are using to stomp out new blood. Sure, some of it is good and protects people, but most of it is just bureaucratic flexing.Also, Europeans don't have nearly the disposable income as people in the US. The cost of having all that vacation time I guess.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 18:40:06'] Too much regulation is correct. In USA you can work till you drop, which is what is needed To get a start up going. Wouldn’t be allowed in Europe pushing for 30 hour work weeks. Among many other things but that’s one of the reasons

This is Europe as a whole, a single entity. United, like USA. Instead you have a Europe with no single ideology, myth or cause to unite them. No single language. No single military. No single chain of command. There is no "European dream" like there is an American dream.

If you don't sell your soul for money and claw your way to higher net worth you will fall into the abyss. In the UK you have an ok social safety net, so even your rich aren't very motivated to get richer. They just sit in their castles and collect artifacts from other cultures.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 19:47:37'] I’ve lived in both places and the answer is simple.  It’s not money. It’s not level of intellect or peoples drive. There is unlimited money everywhere, especially London. There is more drive in London than anywhere, it’s why London produces the best musicians. I shit you nought, it’s the weather and the basic infrastructure of life. Texas, California, New York….. these people aren’t more driven then UK talent.  Look at fashion and art to see that.These places simply have more desirable living conditions for people who are tech minded workers who want to work in a company of 10,000 tech minded individuals.  Space….. not over crowded…… big ass office, free food and drinks in the office cuz living is cheap…… the ability to get to and from work without London congestion charges….. Like, fuck London mate…… it’s good for fashion, punk music, Camden, and a secret banking system. But give me the New York skyscrapers and a great night life. Give me the California beaches and perfect weather.  Give me the Texas mansions life for $300,000 and a pool and bbq…… And you will attract real talent who will work at your company. You gotta be a sadistic alcoholic to love London. And that breeds art….. not Tech.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 19:46:55'] the UK is an isolated island that experiences shithouse weather and you have little to no natural resources. i think this explains in large part why your first sailers went out to explore and then consequently colonised huge swathes of land all over the world. the grass truly was greener in other parts of the world.you got too lazy off of your imperialist activities, exploiting free labour, stealing other countries' resources, looting, taxing your subject countries, etc. etc...that you didn't have to be innovative and actually work hard yourselves.your country basically got a huge leg up and became wealthy due to your colonialism. this is what made you the financial centre of the world at that time.britain is a country that is very much stuck in its ways, is not dynamic, fast-moving, etc..the fact that you still revere the royal family and subsidise their luxurious existence and ideas of aristocracy shows that you're still too "comfortable" and set in your ways and not wanting to embrace change (for the better). there is an idealisation of the notion of wanting to be treated like a celebrity, kick your feet up and relax at other people's expense, whilst you do next to nothing. might explain the proliferation of so many reality tv shows in britain too. everyone wants to become a flipping 'celebrity' and we use that term loosely. deeply set racist attitudes don't help because if you look at who heads a lot of these top-tier US companies, they're people who are immigrants. steve jobs was half syrian, etc...the fact that you voted to exit the EU also shows that you're not willing to cooperate, collaborate, learn, exchange and want to be isolationist. might also show that you have a superiority complex and that attitude does no-one any favours. you don't evolve without any outside input and perspectives.also having tory conservative governments consecutively is not conducive to growth and evolution. they basically want to keep the power in the hands of people who already have it and keep expenditure at the lowest which means not spending money on anything.can new talents rise the ranks and stand a chance and establish companies in the UK with that type of establishment and gatekeeping?there's a lot of factors which prevent innovation and dynamism in a country and i've presented some to you regarding your own country. the whole reason why the US became independent of britain was because they fought you and won after being sick of being taxed to the teeth by you.

If they create something in Europe that is successful, it gets bought by a big US Corp before it turns too big.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:16:40'] Its mainly because of Immigration and Money. USA sucks up all the big brains from the world via H1B plus they have infinite money supply to support businesses. So many immigrants have supported and enhanced the tech industry. They have literally created empires.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:18:41'] I honestly think its because the government mostly doesn't interfere with businesses. They don't for example, force Apple to use a specific connector for their phone or try to block Microsoft from purchasing Activision. As an aside, it is mind blowing that the UK can try to block an American company from purchasing another American company.Your country could be worse, you could be China and absolutely kneecap their companies like Alibaba.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:29:01'] Regulations and taxes are probably the root cause. Also form the outside looking in it seems to me that the average Brit has no real drive. Most of the young British people I've known have been less focused on changing their economic status themselves and instead blame their poverty on the society while at the same time not wanting to grind and make a difference themselves. I think that's sort of because you guys lack the idea of 'the American dream', where social mobility is not just idolized but incredibly possible in the USA today (despite what the lazy doomers say).

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 23:11:33'] Lol the UK did produce ARM but the nature of the average investor in the LSE is one who wants good dividends. It’s reached a stage where any non conventional (I.e. tech companies esp. in their initial stages) gets a lower valuation than it would if it listed in the US, and the few folks in the UK who do want exposure to tech now prefer to do it by investing in the US.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 00:04:53'] US based tech giants are the world's most anti-competitive entities. They buy out or crush foreign competition before it becomes an issue. Example: Tiktok(China-based) went viral and put the dick in META. So the US gub'ment took to the defense by outlawing the app in several states, spinning out misinformation the ccp was stealing info about US shitizens, etc... and gave META time to catch up with Reels. They also required sale of part of Tiktok to a US based company if I recall correctly. We also have outlawed sale of advanced semiconductors to China under the guise of "They're gonna attack Taiwan!". It's all bullshit. US kleptomancy and anti-competitive behavior to protect our companies' dominance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 00:20:38'] The US copied a bunch of economically beneficial ideas from the UK but put them in a larger geographic area with abundant natural resources and trade routes.  Even the perpetually temperate climate of California has some value to maintaining stability for the region. The US swooped in on that sweet post WWII slump and continued to throw every spare dollar at the military... which usually involved technology. The "they're about to find out why we don't have free healthcare" meme.The military takes our tax money and uses it to build private sector tech and snort up any remotely useful weapon adjacent stuff starting at a fairly early stage level (Ex: Army Futures Command + Capital Factory in ATX).   This combination of right time right place plus a commitment to sacrificing almost anything and everything to keep building bigger weapons forever. We keep college and healthcare behind a paywall to ensure access to young people who may die for the military industrial complex.  If they live, then they might have gained valuable skills backed up by years of attempts to brainwash loyalty which increases their odds of creating more future citizens to serve the oligarchs.   The US also vacuums up talent from elsewhere.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:06:25'] - Anti growth mindset and NIMBYism in the general population- Aging, shrinking population. Fewer young people - less innovation- Backward looking culture (but we used to have an empire!)- Low wages, high cost of living, high taxes relative to US- Lack of second and third tier cities. UK economy is basically London and not much elseGo to one of the great universities and get a good education, and you will have no problem emigrating to USA, where you will earn much more while paying lower taxes -> brain drain.Innovative companies choose to be listed in New York rather than London -> less and less prestige for the domestic stock market.Same for Europe in general, really. I love to be European and consider our corner of the world a great place to live, but the old world will never be as dynamic and business-friendly as the new one.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:08:11'] Honestly... I think your university rankings are a bit... shall we say inflated?  Not that it isn't also the case for certain US universities (e.g. I'm not sold on Harvard being all they're talked up as either).  Juggernaut companies aren't just a matter of a strong education pipeline though... I suspect it has more to do with the regulatory environment.  The US is far more tolerant of monopolies than they really should be (compare how the US and the EU treated Microsoft's browser shenanigans, the UK was in the EU at the time).  They also let them get away with more legal damage for much longer... to the point where it runs away from them and they couldn't put the cat back in the bag even if they wanted to.  Often by exploiting seemingly grey areas like Uber does with whether someone is a contractor or an employee.  This is something that I was seeing rulings on in the UK maybe even a decade earlier and those rulings were generally coming down on the side of them being employees.  And as far as I can tell from a quick search, that was upheld when it came to Uber as well: "**Uber now treats all 70,000 of its drivers in Britain as “workers”**  entitled to a minimum wage, holiday pay and pension plans. It comes  weeks after the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling that its drivers  were workers, not independent contractors.Mar 18, 2021" --quoted from my Google search results, Google implies it comes from this article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html)It's probably for the best that the UK doesn't produce mega companies (at least in the interest of the average UK citizen).  In the US, people still suffer heavily even from monopolies that were supposedly broken up at the time.  Even after Bell System was smashed in 1984, the separated companies operated regionally, effectively leaving local monopolies.  And to this day the US appears to be fairly unique in the cooperation between device manufacturers and retailers with phone companies to lock customers into long term phone contracts at purchase with strange financing options.  E.g. you cannot buy an iPhone at Best Buy without signing a cell phone contract.  You have to go direct to the Apple store to get one without contract in the US (or slightly shady methods, unlocked imports on Amazon, eBay phones that who knows..., etc.).  This level of anti-competitive operation is mostly not legal in the UK and EU.    Likewise, when these companies go overseas, they often have US government support even when they operate in ways that aren't normally locally legal.  Less egregiously (maybe?) these days, but the term Banana Republic refers to governments beholden to US firms operating in South America (Honduras, Costa Rica,...).  Of course British companies were able to operate that way back in the days of the British Empire, but these days the UK has less political and economic weight to throw around in that respect.  The British and Dutch East India companies started as local monopolies and again, benefited from the projection of power globally.  Mega companies require political buy in to have favorable policies and procedures through regulatory capture.  More robust political involvement and stronger regulatory authority and independence would be expected to put a damper on such massive enterprises.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:10:50'] Because the American way is to fuck over the little man for just antiny bit if profit, then bloat the company with nonexistent value, and sell that through marketing agencies to the public. This is why the American tech stockk prices are so detached from reality. It's a bubble. They've just gotten better at edging it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:13:04'] It's because of VC investors majorly based in our Bay Area( San Jose, Palo Alto). They are risk-taking entities that pour a fortune into innovative minds. Also, we have a larger and growing young population due to more and more immigrants and diversity which creates a vibrant market for new innovative products and services.Don't know about people in the UK but we have a hustling culture and entrepreneurial mindset right from our early life. Our retirement accounts are linked to the stock market. Side gigs make us feel proud of ourselves and not drained. You talk about work-life balance but work is our life. The American Dream is gathering more and more assets through capitalism. We are not afraid of being overly leveraged( that has screwed us sometimes but has largely helped us grow exponentially)

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 03:11:08'] Ok but why?? Apple is the most fragile... While they're great at doing business, the success is only based on morons buying into their marketing. If Apple disappeared today, not much would change in the world, if Google disappeared, it would take years to but a similarly good search engine, and what about maps? Even Gmail is not so easy to replace with a tool as effective...of Amazon disappeared, shopping will immediately become harder (which might be a good though) and our lives be impacted white bit...Apple and Tesla are the 2 most overrated stocks, I can't believe people still buy those,only thing keeping up the value is marketing and people's stupidity (which I admit is a very strong and aboundant "resource" in the world)... As soon as the trends change and they become uncool, they will collapse...
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 21:09:29'] Apple isn't a company - it's a cult. Jim Jones would've made a great CEO for them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 04:25:35'] Which should really show you that apple will eat a massive bag of dicks at some point. There is almost nothing left for them to increase as far as market growth. They have what Amazon has in the cloud computing space. No where to go and everything to lose to competition. Apple is being forced to switch to USB C and that's going to cut massively into accessories sales. The iPhone this year was lackluster and we are in a recession/heading to one. I can definitely see a future in the next 1 or 2 earnings where they lose 30% immediately as everyone who's loaded into that company tries to cash out at the top. The biggest player I'd watch to see if there is any issue is warren Buffett. That dudes portfolio is now unbelievably heavy in apple. If you start to see reports that say Warren Buffett is rebalancing his portfolio so no need to worry about him offloading millions of shares, that's the time to start buying puts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 05:28:35'] I love Apple and don’t understand how companies even allow people to have email an a non-apple device due to privacy and security issues. That said, there is no way Apple is worth more than Alphabet, Amazon and Meta. And I say that believing the latter three are overvalued. But here is the thing… Apple had great hardware and software, but their main competitive edge is how they organized their supply chain. Unfortunately the world has decided to turn into a protectionist hell so this main advantage will sadly disappear or at the very least need to be reconfigured. People are still paying premium price for an advantage that is a disadvantage in the new world order that is being shaped as we speak. I’m rooting for Apple and globalization, and to support them I have a few puts outstanding to inverse myself.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-06 07:48:35'] Apple has always done well when it comes to their spending and earnings, which is why they are such a high value corporations. Meta keeps pouring their money into the meta verse plans which look like garbage and attract no positive attention and do not look like they will be making a profit on that for a while. Google on the other hand is loosing ad revenue and their other products such as the phones and other hardware products don't seem to be doing well in terms of sale. Amazon is feeling the hit of inflation with consumer spending dropping because of increased cost of goods. Apple is the only one that is doing well as they their products have done well over the past few month especially with the release of the M2 chip in their new Macbooks.

It's in a price range that people can reasonably afford, getting units into hands means more 3rd party development.

Genius!!!For all the shittalking the Europeans receive for sucking off russian gas it’s amazing how much the Americans suck off Chinese slave labor (and Europe I guess but they’re not the ones defending Taiwan)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 07:09:17'] I actually took a semiconductor fab class in grad school where we had to make a flow cytometer on a chip.  It was boring as absolute fuck.  You literally just follow a recipe and standard procedure.  You have to sit there and wash the fuck outta chips with tons and tons of water for hours....it's so boring.  It does not take rocket genius IQ to fab chips (design is different), it is just tons of labor who follows directions like a worker bee drone.  America has always outsourced this kind of monotonous type of labor to save money.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 06:17:05'] I guess thats what happens when your largest factory has a mass exodus and the other ones are trying to revolt. Remember, digital ID is the death of freedoms across the world

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-07 15:14:07'] Here's a fun fact for all of you - currently you can't build any semiconductors without Neon gas (for the lithography machines). * 80% of Neon gas comes from Ukraine and Russia.  * Ukraine has stopped production for obvious reasons.* Russia can't export due to sanctions. * The other 20% comes from China. Next year is going to be interesting.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 06:01:13'] Apple had a 3rd original founder in addition to Jobs and Wozniak- Ron Wayne sold his 10% for $800.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:03:58'] Appl got a lot of problems after that and until Steve jobs came back. It could have been very different.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:41:27'] If some time travellers got back into past and bought large portions of Apple, Steve Jobs would have quit or open another company, after selling his shares. Still staying would be like working as employee.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:33:39'] "No regrets"Accompanied by picture of a man with regret written all over his face.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 06:16:14'] The question is, if he had bought a third, would Apple be what they are now? Probably not, they were about to go bankrupt in 1997
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 06:16:40'] Ive got my own regrets to look to, i don't need to look to his. I sold 450 btc at $10 after seeing an article saying it hit $30. I thought it was going to 0.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 06:49:59'] Hindsight is 20/20, AAPL was considered a zombie company with no future in a market dominated by the likes of IBM and MSFT. Nobody wanted to make software tools for MacIntosh because nobody even use them. Hell, AAPL was considered garbage even when iPhone was first released. Everyone thought it's going to be a fad and destined to fail like MSFT's Windows Phone. Of course there were people who thought AAPL will dominate and bought in early, that's why those people aren't posting here.Moral of the story? People can't magically see decades into the future and can only predict so much with existing data.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 06:45:13'] Is the deal still standing? I can get together 50K for this. I'm just gonna need an ice pack for my jaw after.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 04:49:05'] There is no doubt that Nolan Bushnell made the right decision when he turned down Steve Jobs' offer of a third of Apple at $50,000. While it is true that Apple went on to become one of the most successful companies in history, there is no guarantee that this would have been the case if Bushnell had taken Jobs up on his offer. In fact, it is quite possible that things could have turned out very differently for both men if they had gone down different paths.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 05:39:21'] Regarded indeed
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:39:06'] Could woulda shoulda. If you do. They go belly up. If you don’t. They become apple as it is today. You just can’t win. Jos lost too… his life….
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 07:01:00'] Truth be told. If he had done so, with that much control, apple would probably not have become Apple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:28:35'] If he had a controlling stake in the company he could have fucked it right up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 11:00:21'] Or the people who spent 10k BTC on Pizza and things before it blew up. Shit happens, just wipe, flush and get back into it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 15:12:24'] That’s like calling someone regarded for buying Tesla At 20 and selling when it’s at 100 and not holding until 2000….nobody could predict aapl would be where it’s at today

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 09:42:42'] I’ve got $50k. Is that offer still good?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 11:19:12'] Remember they were competitors. The Atari home computer (400 and 800) were their game console with a keyboard added.  Atari was the first to sell their computer in a retail chain - Sears. Sears, not knowing what the thing was, sold it in its home appliance department along with the Kenmore vacuum cleaners, blenders, Little Mac hamburger cookers, and ironing boards.  The sales people had no training and not a clue how it worked. They could not demo them.  So they sat there with lovely cardboard signage turned off.Bushnell would have been dumb to support a competitor. Atari was bought by Waner Communications in 1976. They sold it to Jack Tramiel of Commodore fame in 1984. People look at personal computers as something that has always been around and has clear value. Not so at all. In the beginning you could not give them away. No one had a clue why you would want one. Hell the handheld calculator had just come out and people struggled adopting it.  The learning curve was steep; the software buggy.  The memory was so small you couldn't do much.  Then came the Visicalc spreadsheet. The first "killer app".  It allowed middle management to do REAL work every day and being middle management could sign off on the expense - which was SUBSTANTIAL for a real computer, keyboard, printer, terminal (or monitor) and floppy disk drives.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 12:10:22'] Creator of Diablo game, David Brevik, was offered a portion of what would become Hotmail for a desk to work on. Since they were crunching towards game release he refused. As per wiki: In 2016, Brevik revealed that he was once approached by Sabeer Bhatia in 1996 to form an email company in which he will get 10% of the shares. Brevik flatly rejected the offer, thinking it was the "stupidest idea." 14 months later, when the company, later known as Hotmail, sold for $400 million, Brevik expressed his regret over that decision, calling it the "worst business decision of my entire career."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VscdPA6sUkc&t=2033s&ab_channel=GDC The man himself talking about it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:43:21'] while this is regarded in hindsight you have to learn to adopt the attitude that you make the best decisions you can based on the available evidence &#x200B;the part we arent showing here in this headline is when he turned this down we were talking about 50k in like 1976that would be 265k in todays moneyand they wanted him to invest in the Apple Iso you have an untested product, a new start up, a completely new field really - home computing, no real proof that this things going to take off, and oh yeah he wants a quarter of a million dollars in todays money for 30%to think that you would, in that same position, throw that kind of money at that sort of product is a bit laughable. 99% of you wouldnt, and in fact you would mock and laugh at the person who did if they posted it here.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 10:06:18'] There are two ways to look at it, from a “see, even the successful experts make mistakes” perspective and the “he probably had so many lucrative opportunities, Apple might not have even been the most rewarding, especially if that $50,000 opportunity cost came at the expense of a more personally important investment” perspective.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 14:42:40'] Reading his biography now, there was a guy at the very start who was offered a chunk of the company rather than get paid up front.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 22:07:43'] Apple almost went bankrupt multiple times and when he was able to buy a third of the company it was a huge risk on a couple of guys making computers. Nobody knows the future until you are there hindsight doesn't make a decision worth scrutiny.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 02:34:18'] This is a personal story. When I first started my company over 20 years ago, my doctor friend offered to invest some money. I told him I could use $10,000 and I would give him 50% of the company. He said it was too rich for his blood and he turned it down. Ten years later, when I was living in a mansion and going on vacation all over the world whenever I felt like I used to love bringing that up and reminding him when we were drinking beer 😂😂😂
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 18:53:57'] Nolan Bushnell wasn’t smart, he lucked into Atari.  I met him once at a failed automated restaurant concept at Westfield Promenade in Woodland Hills CA and didn’t see the vision.  It basically was the idea of the Red Robin table tablet you see today which totally sucks.

Robots will be far far more costly.  Costly to purchase, costly to maintain.  They likely have proprietary designs where you must pay a particular tech to work on the machines, who charges obscene rates.

POST_TEXT: b"Added more to my positions since the last DD I posted. Check it out if you haven't. Basically, I'm betting my entire savings on MVIS. I've been accumulating for a few years. So far, it's working out. I have a strong thesis and think the risk to reward ratio is worth it. I hope my conviction pays off.\n\nAll this AI money is going to rotate into computer vision. MVIS has a patent moat for LASER BEAM SCANNING (LBS). They use this technology to offer lidar products but also have other verticals.\n\nThe next step for AI is giving machines perception. Check out the Garter hype cycle for AI and pay attention to the date/timelines. You can also see that computer vision is outpacing all other forms of AI (even ahead of generative AI). MVIS is computer vision. \n\nhttps://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/articles/images/hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2022.png\n\nMVIS also offers a NEAR EYE DISPLAY (NED) solution using their LBS tech.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 00:22:58'] If it triples, I’ll be green again. Oh the pain.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 23:00:32'] Started with Mavis around the same time you did. Lowered my average to just under 2.50 when it tanked hard and increased my share count 5 fold. Also grabbed 80 calls spread between Jan 24 and Jan 25 that are now mostly in the money. Short version is Microvision had specialized in development of LBS (laser beam scanning) tech for decades. Shoot a laser at a mirror, mirror vibrates creating a scan. This can be used to create ultra efficient, high brightness near eye displays (Microsoft uses the Microvision display engine currently in Hololens,) and more importantly it can be used to create ultra efficient, cost effective LiDAR. After it became clear a couple years ago that the market for augmented reality and the display technologies that support it would not be mature for some time Microvision pivoted to being purely LiDAR focused. Specifically automotive LiDAR. They created their flagship automotive LiDAR sensor Mavin and aside from being cost efficient it is the highest performing sensor available (combination of points per second captured, operating distance, refresh rate and a few other goodies for good measure.) Management has continued to clearly communicate a timeline with milestones that they regularly deliver on. They don’t BS about financials, have cash on hand and appear to have ended the insane dilution that was the hallmark of previous CEOs. I believe in the tech, I believe in the timing and I believe in management. The gamble lies in who is winning the production contracts for the next few years at major automotive manufacturers that most LiDAR companies are projecting to be awarded this year (MVIS management have reiterated that this summer is what they are shooting for.) That’s basically what MVIS and every automotive LiDAR competitor is waiting on. If Im right and sweet baby Mavis captures a significant share of the automotive LiDAR market in the next couple years I get to retire early. If I’m wrong I probably break even or at worst leave with bags as heavy as they were a month ago. Either way it will be decided this year. MVIS has the best subreddit of investors I’ve seen so far and the best, most detailed info is over there. There are some short squeeze mechanics at play but after the last one most of the people on that sub (including myself) are much more interested in the steady climb that’s been playing out over the past month.

I’m pretty much all in MVIS, have been for a while and just kept adding when they kept pushing the share price down. The last month has been spectacular but the world hasn’t seen anything yet.

Losses seem to be accelerating and revenue is, overall, declining on an annual basis ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MVIS/financials?p=MVIS](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MVIS/financials?p=MVIS)). How are you guys justifying buying this at these absurd prices? NVDA is trading at 35x price to sales as a comparison point. They also have a history of heavy dilution.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:19:13'] Totally dude. Really strong isophenoid resistance coming off the blue triangle false uptrend and a very clear Head Shoulder Knees and Toes pattern. The squiggles are off the charts too
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:09:50'] Oh NO! Did that just go under the random triangle?! DAMNIT
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:32:58'] BRO! Draw a line to catch the bar before it falls more yo!

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:59:36'] Babe wake up, new triangles just dropped
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:17:52'] What's with all this BS TA lately, can't we go back to reliable DD like the dog who used to predict SPY based on which side of the lawn it pissed on or at least Tardstrology from the morning talks?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 14:33:49'] This chart does an amazing job of showing how the stock went up, then down, then up again, only to go down.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:28:40'] What four price points made you put a triangle there?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:44:21'] What does this even mean? Moon or Wendy's?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:01:01'] If Apple falls it will take down the other big tech companies with it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:18:43'] How can you see that candles under all of that shit?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 04:04:14'] It’ll be back to $150 by the end of the year. Never disappoints in burning shorts
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:34:15'] The glass floor has broken my friends. We begin the next -20% leg down
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 14:31:12'] If you zoom out a bit you can see the shape of a dinosaur, the triangle is the head, the dip is the torso, and on the far left the tail.That means: Apple = Extinction .
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:41:19'] I still draw those in my coloring book
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:58:44'] That's a big head and shoulders. More reliable that your triangle. More pain coming.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 14:01:18'] God this sub has really gone downhill over the last couple years
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 10:52:19'] Apple Inc. (AAPL) is currently trading at $132.01 on the NASDAQ exchange. The stock has a bearish flag pattern and is down 0.08% for the day. ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 05:41:49'] Clear breakdown as I predicted about AAPL few days back
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:32:41'] For those who wonder: this chart comes from [Tradingview.com](https://Tradingview.com) and both of the figures there are automatically generated by the website if you enable them. The funny thing here (and the purpose of this post) is showing you that the system detected both a bearish flag and a bullish pennant at the same time, that's it.  Of course, the only right one is the bearish, so far. Thanks for sharing this for your amusement and also for your comments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 16:49:48'] Crash to the floor so I can dump my savings into $AAPL and $SPY
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:29:49'] I like your call, AAPL is the one of the most expensive stocks in multiple valuation i think its a good time TO buy some putsEdit: i didnt realize that was a minute chart that is shit
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:46:48'] Serious question is this chart thing really works? I see a lot of these on different subs and mostly followed by loss porn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:37:37'] This is an intraday chart….
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 11:50:00'] Looks like the lgtbqrst3.14- flag

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 12:35:24'] 132 next from my point of view
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 15:49:14'] If you use a black horizontal line on 4x thickness then the price will bounce off it next time. Rookie mistake using a green triangle, its not strong enough to make the price bounce 🤦‍♀️
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 13:54:07'] Do buy the head fake

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 14:18:34'] Head and shoulders?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 14:26:48'] What do all these lines mean?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 15:39:09'] A curious event? It’s obviously the double peak up side down candle pattern. Usually happens 2-3 months after an iPhone release. I’ve seen this before. Not to worry - this is the best time to buy more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 17:43:47'] That’s an extremely low time frame
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:02:23'] It’s because I bought AAPL calls end of day today.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:32:49'] Its began to look like Tesla's crappy tetrahedron pick up, trailing smoking exhaust fumes?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:33:20'] Would you short it to 131.80?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:34:41'] You literally just drew a random bottom line.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:47:58'] Classic plesiosaur setup
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:50:49'] I put a stop loss in at 140 around thanksgiving as a hedge hoping it would never hit, it did rose about 5/6 bucks and then continued down down
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 18:55:48'] Wait until it hits 100 and yolo it.   But it might not ever come back.  Just like the last time this happened all the big ones fell and did not come back.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:07:40'] Can someone please eli5 the chart?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:08:55'] So curious. What is this phenomenon?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:25:03'] Pretty visible head and shoulders there you have listed as a bull pennant… complete with a break of structure and the push back into the left shoulder area…I’d say this is going down much further…
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:28:10'] OP, your idea literally can’t go tits up. Take out a loan to throw at it. You can’t lose. I see the gorilla dick daddy pattern and you’re right.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:35:22'] Looks like a path a snail would leave in my yard
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:36:40'] This is clearly your standard "All Up In Them Guts" cycle. Snoop Dogg should have the wrinkles and crevices smoothed out by morning. If not, we will see a long tech play with rigorous oscillation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:48:27'] I like the green lines, you’re doing great drawing your Christmas tree
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 19:48:29'] What's the r^2 ?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 20:43:42'] Ooof. Looks even worse on the weekly and monthly chart.  120 target maybe?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 20:53:36'] My AAPL puts are up 88% so far. They are April expiry so plenty of time for them to go up more. I think this sell off will probably bottom in 3 to 5 weeks and I'll sell them. Wait for a bounce/drop in the Vix to reload.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 21:10:26'] Apple better rally I have a 140 C expiring 12/30 SMH lol

Not because anybody gives a shit about corn bros, but the bad press and shitting in the cults Cheerios is going to end up creating a lobby group to shine a lot of attention on the anti-competitive nature of these app stores, and when the legislation starts happening... And it will eventually because apple doesn't pay much in us taxes, it's going to seriously impact apple and google.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 02:46:12'] Sounds like a pretty big fail for Apple in the long term if they plan to push this across all exchanges.It's unlikely any of the exchanges will want to take a cut on their fees without pushing it on to consumers and if you're someone that trades often why would you choose to continue using a device that you pay more per trade.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 07:44:43'] While I disagree with Apple’s decision here (and am sure it will be resolved soon), the headline is wrong. Apple did *not* block an update to the Coinbase app; they blocked an update to the Coinbase *Wallet* app. There’s a huge difference, and you can continue to trade on the Coinbase app as always.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 10:35:52'] That’s just the publicly traded companies. This doesn’t include wholly owned subsidiaries such as BNSF (approx. $200 billion market cap) and Union Pacific, or any of the others for that matter.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:01:06'] Those shares make 800m in dividends a year
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 10:34:01'] I trade pretty similarly but only holding $110b in apple atm
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:03:15'] Once he start selling Apple look out
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 09:06:26'] He made money and I blew up my portfolio. That is the comparison
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:44:38'] Didn't he say he doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand? Man's has money in activision blizzard.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 07:40:49'] Huh… so many Liberty Media flavours! I should look into those.UPDATE: what does he see in LM F1? Never turned a profit. 2.5B revenue. Is that truly worth $13.5B?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 09:10:21'] The portfolio is interesting because I don't have $122bn in AAPL
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:52:57'] People look past the Coca-Cola stock because it's not as flashy but that's a truly god-tier investment. Bulletproof brand that could only take damage from, I don't know, poisoning their own products with strychnine or something. They sell water with minute amounts of additional flavor and carbon dioxide for like 2000% markups. And people are addicted to their products in a socially acceptable way.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:05:10'] My fundamental problem is that WHEN he liquidates the apple position, the algorithms trade faster than I can gtfo. Instant bag holder because Warren decided to have his morning shit a few minutes early and some algorithm fucked up his routine and he sold apple because he no longer believed in the company.Pass.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:05:41'] How does it compare to my portfolio? Are you being serious with that question?!? Listen, its the equivalence of being shoulder to shoulder with Peter North, except I just got out of an ice bath and he's standing at attention.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 14:51:40'] He is waiting for AAPL to get into the EV business. It has the cash and tech to takeover an existing EV startup and to transform it into a power house. If AAPL got into a partnership with BYD for a JV to create an AAPL brand that would also make sense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:45:10'] He only buys stocks from great companys. In my view the best investment strategy. I looking to make the same strategy. Never forget BUY THE DIP.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 08:56:28'] I bought Berkshire when it started to dip from it's ATH but it was still a very high price I paid. I'm focusing on the credit card and tech investments such as APPL that Berkshire has invested in but some others like COCA COLA bring in a good amount of $ for the company. With that being said, I do feel that maybe there's too much invested in certain companies but hopefully it's a strategic play.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:25:45'] Buffet / BRK has a vastly different financial position from me so what Buffet or BRK does or doesn’t do is largely irrelevant to what I do financially.If your financial holdings are on par with Buffet’s then certainly you should follow his moves, otherwise you’re just looking at stock porn.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:31:11'] 1. Buffett is a focus investor. When he buys stocks, it's as if he's buying the company. He is running a corporation not a tax-sheltered retirement account. So he faces big tax bills for selling gains. Moreover, Buffett's philosophy is to let stocks run for multiple baggers as with Apple. So, when he buys, he buys permanently - unless he changes his mind. But it's very unusual for him to change his mind.2. Buffett is an arb. He's been arbing takeovers since the 1950s. That's Activision. He's not an insider at MSFT, but he is an arb. He knows MSFT has plenty of cash to get the deal done.3. To gain insight about what he's thinking, it's best to consider his new positions and adds. This year he's been buying some major oil companies and Paramount Global, HP, and Citibank. When Buffett buys he moves billions of dollars. His co-managers move much smaller amounts.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:34:47'] He is concentrated but he also buys things when they’re a good buy. He didn’t choose that to be the allocation, he buys what he views is a good buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:35:31'] Aso look at when he bought this or his portfolio over time
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 11:37:38'] How much dividend he get per year?

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 12:23:24'] Buffet is a rent-seeker. The man buys companies that have well-passed the innovation stage but have presumably monopoly power (or close enough to it) in their respective industries and are charging to the point of zero consumer surplus.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-16 19:52:05'] Warren Buffett only have like 10 years of life ahead. I will have like 70 years in the future but I can not be sure if I reach to live too long. Warren Buffett stocks worth in the next 70 years it would be like 90,000% up or a lot of more in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-17 01:54:43'] While it may not be Kosher on this meme investing sub, on average you will make more money by investing into everything (an index fund) than by any other stock investment scheme. The two exceptions are when you play an active role in a company (like Berkshire Hathaway does in all of those companies it owns larger portions of), and when you can read financial statements and understand cashflows well enough to recognize low risk unicorns when they occasionally appear. That’s when you short and make big money. But I’ll tell you right now, pretty much any company you’ve ever heard of isn’t going to be a unicorn; those things take work to find.

Apple is no longer a growth company, and the premium prices it can charge will erode over time. I would not be surprised if Berkshire starts reducing its stake in Apple when the market cycles higher.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 14:20:55'] It's only a myth if you can reliably choose the stocks that outperform instead of ending up with ones that underperform or do nothing at all.The more diverse your portfolio is the more likely you are to have the winners in it and you have to hope that when it averages out the winners do better than the losers.Or you can drink your own piss and drop your entire paycheck into calls that expire in an hour on a weed stock or something.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 16:57:10'] Not a myth. TSLA, META, and NVDA dropped like 70% of their highs before this reversal. AMZN and GOOG dropped pretty hard too. But, during that time, SPY dropped maybe like 30% at worst. You can't and shouldn't just cherry-pick any condition.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 04:42:52'] People don’t understand how incredibly expensive 30x sales is. If the company had no costs, paid no salaries, issued no stock comp, and returned all of its revenues to shareholders, it would take 30 years to pay you back… you can assume growth of course but that’s A LOT of ground to make up.In comparison, the 30 year is paying you 4% per year.Take a look at the long time chart of CSCO.Cisco has a negative annualized return going back to April of 2000. 23 years and the return is still NEGATIVE. This is with dividends reinvested.It’s far more common for stocks to simply languish than to go bankrupt. NVDA could be around 20 years from now, still in business, making a great product and have 0 stock return over the entire period.https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2000&firstMonth=4&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=CSCO&allocation1_1=100

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 20:26:27'] The stock went up 27% after hours during the earnings call. That’s like taking 3-5 years worth of accelerated profits into account. I sold at 385. This is a general public stock now, it’s current upside is limited. Especially when you consider the market cap.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 00:07:02'] investors dont give a shit about sales today, they look to the future, when AI becomes more prevalent there will be an even greater increase in demand for their data centers/products, they are already seeing a surge in demand for them especially from huge companies, their revenue for that alone is over 4 billion and was the reason why their quarterly revenue was higher, future looks promising nvidia

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 22:29:52'] The key difference is Grace Hopper.No, not the computer scientist, the platform named after her.I was just reading up on the architecture the other weekend and the tech here is pretty profound, especially when you consider the power of the ARM chip in the combo platform. The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.And the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.I take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. Should it be this way? No.Does it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely. It's an apples and oranges comparison.

The application is tough because it’s a language model. Spent a lot of time on mushrooms discussing this with some other that are near the industry. Language was on topic that kept coming up along with the fact we have no idea how much computing power ai could take. Everyone thought bitcoin mining took a lot of work, now considered ai that is running thousands of computations to come up with the “right” answer. It’s gonna be a mess for a while and may never reach its full potential cause it’s based on humans and our language

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:26:52'] Well using a perpetual dividend model to make an equivalent company: Nvidia has a cost of equity about 9.55%. I am going to say this theoretical company is going to have a dividend growth of 8% per year for perpetuity, then NVDA is currently priced equivalent to a company that returns a $6.5 annual dividend that grows 8% FOREVER. This is absurd, the price will definitely come down or their cost of equity will skyrocket.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 05:00:01'] Apple Microsoft and Google are dinosaurs and have lots of competitorsNvidia makes stuff nobody else makes and it's powering everything AI. The military and commercial space are dumping so much money into AI, just to get a piece of the pie.IMHO there is a ton of speculation on its future growth and people think it's gonna go way up over time, myself included
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:29:39'] I work in this field.  I GUARANTEE you that the execs at Nvidia are saying "they think our chips have anything to do with AI!?  Uhh, okay...lets go with that then"

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 05:39:51'] Seems way overpriced.  This means little though as the hype will be repeated by NVDA every quarter.  It is a stock to just avoid IMO.NFLX seems like a stock that can take off due to streaming services going through the growing pains of realizing they may have gained sub money but they also lost the revenue from selling content to NFLX and others.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:41:33'] At it’s peak Tesla traded with price to sales around 25. Nvda is the next Tesla according to some, so they figure records are meant to be doubled. Next stop, price to sales 50.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 11:43:02'] Nvidia has been riding on the crypto boom since 2016.  The market did crash in 2017 and Nvidia coasted on their RTX 20 series which weren't well received.  Then COVID19 happened and everyone got government checks and stayed home to play games, but more importantly another crypto boom happened.  The crypto market went proof of stake, which means you won't be using Nvidia GPU's to mine crypto.  To the day the #2 GPU used on Steam is the GTX 1060, a 2016 graphics card.  The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.  Also these bulls are looking for anything that goes up and their collective mind has settled on Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:13:42'] It’s not over, priced only because demand forward growth potential, long-term growth, supply and demand order contracts… Dot anywhere purchase between 317 and 417 is a great purchase for the next 3 to 8 years
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 13:51:55'] Let me put some perspective. If Nvidia has revenue of 100bn (will have to more than double) with a profit margin of 40% (will have to increase from 30%) they will generate 40 bn in profit and multiply that by 25 will give you 1 trillion marketcap. So basically its overvalued. A lot of future is priced in for perfection. I would suggest short it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:27:57'] It wasn’t too long ago that Tesla was trading @ $1200 + a share how would it be crazy to think a company based on technology that could replace millions of jobs be in the same ballpark. The main question is your cost average at an overbought level to maximize ROI
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:29:09'] Its less expensive now than it was before they announced earnings. Going from 7 billion to 11 billion is pretty amazing
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:43:10'] It's incredibly overvalued but it'll keep riding cause you know, fuck you
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:54:46'] It does not seem too high. Investors expect an increased demand in the future and so profit. What can you expect  about Amazon? Another pandemic?

The big whales are on their yachts ~~snorting cocaine out of the most expensive hooker's juicy asshole~~ making cherished memories with their friends and family on vacation, so it's going to be a bad time to buy. They do this almost every year, drive the stocks up by end of May, make a killing and then the monkeys here buy at ATH.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 03:59:17'] 50x forward P/E for a company that’s expecting massive sales and earnings growth isn’t that overpriced to me personally.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 07:32:07'] Let’s put it this way, what company is worth more: the manufacturer that makes brake pads, or Ford? There is your answer. GPU’s are important for AI but they aren’t going to be the money driver it will be the products other companies develop. Also most likely the big AI company hasn’t been started yet, but the future owner probably just got fired from his tech job.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 00:04:53'] I hope so cuz I'm holding puts
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 02:52:25'] So what if they report doubling of the sales over the next year? Then once more? Etc.It’s expensive now, no doubt, but looking at the ratios without trying to understand what assumptions may have gone into it is a path to loss porn
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:50:08'] It's overvalued but not grossly. Look at its forward data. Forward PE 40. Could definitely do with say a 20% correction but they could just as easily grow another 10% together with a 10% correction instead. Plus it has hype status. It's basically a meme stock but with the fundamentals to support it. I sure as hell wouldn't short it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 16:45:52'] AI needs a lot of NVDA’s chips. A LOT

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:10:09'] If they grow into their valuation sure its justified. I like INTC better. Intel has their own Foundries and make chips and GPU's for themselves and others. INTC has half market cap of AMD and a tenth of NVDA's market cap. They also make more money than NVDA and AMD.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:13:57'] Yea, what does Tesla trade at?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:35:55'] Yeah but AI! Regards.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 06:41:52'] Yes, it is overpriced, it's been overpriced for years. Will it continue to go up from here? My money is on yes.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 08:07:45'] They are out of the mining game. I think it is way over priced.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 09:51:45'] It’s been overpriced for years and it always ends up justifying it. That’s the thing people don’t realize

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 17:03:25'] I just bought back 75 short shares on Friday. Sold at 280 avg and bought at 390.So, yes, very likely.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 17:17:42'] Not even worth the read. Nvidia is low compared to what is coming down the pipeline with development spread and usage growth.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-10 18:28:14'] It will come down. While it’s hard to time, look for a longer term bear put spread and play it both ways.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 01:30:49'] It's disgustingly overvalued. General purpose chips won't take much of market share in machine learning/AI space, they are like the pickup trucks in automobiles.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 18:33:54'] It's not crazy, but it is expensive, meaning the implied growth needed to justify the valuation extends far into the future, so need to be very confident in the longevity and growth of their cash flow.  .

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 10:27:07'] How to make money off AI pump: take big positions in other sectors so that when institutions rotate gains out of tech, you benefit from the shift. Look for high volume buying or accumulation in sectors that are beaten down. but these types of plays mean you might have to sit a while b4 you experience any gains. for lottos you can see which other sectors have high volume buying pressure and take lottos (weeklies) early on those if you wanna gamble. But LEAPS is what I'm mostly talking about. I wouldn't short tech unless you have a good thesis or see heavy institutional selling. Institutions will let the pump go as far as retail is willing to pay. Then they entering distribution phase and dumping shares. Shorting pullbacks on a rally isn't smart because it takes many small pumps for institutions to unload bags on retail. Sell offs can bounce back easily because institutional selling will stop and let retail run the price back up off the dip. That way institutions can keep unloading at their target price.  Imagine institutions dump 1/4 of their positions. Tech sells off. Bears think it's crash. Institutions stop selling and selling pressure goes away (they drive the selling pressure). Then with institutional selling pressure gone, retail dip buyers bring the price back up to institution's price target where they dump another 1/4 of their shares. So on and so forth before they finally unload the last of their position and then tech goes into freefall.

Apple has a significant mote - you can't just start a smartphone company tomorrow to compete with it.

It wont be a terminator skynet situation but it will be very scary in the future when most jobs in america will be overrun by AI. Im just imagining the great migration of educated and uneducated people moving to other countries for work. Also our own government is so smitten by the wonders of AI that nothing will change. We have already seen how COVID digitalized everything and made everyone lazy. Now we will see how lack of regulation will make the unemployment rate skyrocket and the economy implode in on itself in the longrun as less consumers cuz no jobs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-16 12:49:39'] u/mrnotadvice, I understand that VIX is an indicator of 30-day option premiums. The trend you did not discuss in your post is that the last year of "no correlation" is the year of 0DTEs getting increasingly popular. My take - irrespective of the other factors, peeps are getting less interested in 30-day options and more interested in 0TDE, 1DTE, etc. This naturally drives the 30-day premiums down - less demand for them. Thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 00:15:43'] So, if I would post some schizo-ramblings about xyz BEING MANIPULATED by THE MAN, and that the current crisis and crashes of the last year are all ARTIFICIAL and that it takes only one of THESE 5 TRIGGERS or these 10 secret triggers for the market to BOOOM. Would this convince you to flip-flop and buy calls instead?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 22:22:54'] How do you think the US is able to manipulate the oil market other than Biden dumping shit loads of barrels on the market via the SPR (which is about to end). I’ve been wondering how the oil market has had so much weakness when in reality Biden and co. Is about to run out of oil to dump on the market while at the same time OPEC might cut more and we are in summer season which results in massive draws which were only being offset last year by his SPR draws. It’s been upsetting as on oil and gas investor to watch this fucking absolute ass clown in office fuck this up so bad. The rubber band affect is going to play out soon. Rig count is already dropping substantially again like in 2020. This will further decrease supply. The oil companies and investors like me are relatively pissed about how they haven’t let the natural functions of the market play out how they should have all for an election coming up. I think the end result will be an oil shock worse than 2022. The only cure for high prices is higher prices…

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 03:19:04'] i don't buy some of your major points:\- volatility is computed from stock movements, so in order to manipulate you need to manipulate significant parts of the markets. this would require big amounts of capital and also risk. who would do such a foolish move ?\- same with oil. its a huge market, even us is limited in manipulation power. There can be some effort like releasing strat reserve and political pressure, but that's limited in effect. Oil is going down as the ongoing economical global weakness / recession reduces demand

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 08:30:12'] 1. Ironically, it’s Russian oil that is preventing opec from controlling the oil market. Russia needs cash and can’t cut production. I don’t see this changing unless Russia gives up in Ukraine, but even then Russia’s economy will take time to recover.2. I absolutely don’t see the case for Jpow cutting rates to address the debt ceiling fallout. JPow was bullied into not raising rates in 2018 and it is clear that was a massive mistake. I don’t think he will make the mistake of using the Fed to fix political economic crisis again. He even said in the FOMC meeting that the debt ceiling is not the responsibility of the Fed. In this case, I believe him. He’s not going to risk his image/legacy to fix the fallout of a MAGA political stunt. The capitulation will have to be political. 3. A ban on short selling just isn’t going to happen unless a 2008 level event occurs. It won’t be a trigger but a reaction to an already occurring crisis. I don’t think a temporary sell off due to the debt ceiling stunt will qualify. To get political capitulation on the debt ceiling, politicians have to let the stock market suffer in the short term so they can blame the other party for ‘holding our economy hostage’4. Appl may win as the temporary flight to safety play, especially if treasuries are seen as risky given the debt ceiling nonsense.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 10:00:10'] 0dte's are what is bringing vix straight down after peaks which also increases its volatility. Nowadays options are controlling the stock prices, not revenues, p/e or margins.I have seen enough economies degrade to more than obvious oligarchies, so I am sceptical about the great CRASH. There will be downturns, but in slow boiling frog style - until the S&P goes back where it belongs until inflation shoots it up to other magnitudes. What I agree on is that things are worsening, so expect heavier downturns once a week, not once a month like in recent times.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 10:01:29'] Since you mentioned VIX was being suppressed early on, I checked, it is doing the same that it always has, the inverse of SPX.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-14 10:15:33'] Unpopular opinion but I am bullish on tech stocks. All this news gives no edge. Ever heard of the kansas city shuffle? Its a giant con job where u think youve figured out the con but its actually a double con and what you think is the con is actually the decoy and what ends up happening is the opposite. Think about this: inflating dollar is bearish for the dollar in the long run, which in turn is bearish for bonds. Blue chip stocks especially tech have an inverse correlation so they are probably bullish. Ive had this thesis since late last year and the markets reacted as I was suspecting. Remember this whole thing is a zero-sum game. If the news outlets (who are in bed with the banks and fed and treasury and everyone thats corrupt) are selling bearish news - that's like a sports book offering you a recommended bet. I don't think they want you to win in the long run so in general I would do the opposite of what they're saying is going to happen because they have no repercussions from being "wrong" (with their public predictions) and there's nothing stopping jamie from having his traders inverse what he's saying.

If they deal with their tragically insectuous relationship with CCP I will buy again. I like the products and service model.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 04:42:22'] As a British fund analyst, this is hardly news, nor news to half off this sub, but I think people massively misunderstand what we’re looking at. American tech is the platform the entire world runs on, their size is unparalleled among non governmental private businesses. The British public market is one of the largest in the world, nearly double the size of Germany’s. According to Statista’s 2022 ranking it ranked 3rd with a 3.9% share, for reference second is Japan with 6.2% and fourth is China with 3.6%. America’s share is 59.9%. America IS the stock market. Almost every tertiary sector company in every developed economy on earth relies near totally on Apple, Microsoft and Adobe’s software, Visa and MasterCard’s payment processing, Google’s search engine, Nvidia’s chips etc etc. This doesn’t apply to anywhere else because nowhere else has the venture capital, ease of doing business, size of domestic market, culture, lack of regulation and blah blah, and even if they did, it’s near impossible to catch up.

Interest rates on house loans were next to nothing so it was easy to leverage. FTSE 100 companies have some pension money invested but around 2008 pensions were forced to March to liabilities so had to sell stocks for bonds, BREXIT, the U.K. Government is a mess, the island will soon be flooded by global warming, the currency has crashed from 1.60 to the dollar to 1.15 to the dollar in 6 years. The country has a persistent current account deficit, all Brits with shares invest in the US or Asia. The constantly changing tax and spend policies in the U.K. with no clear vision and instead going from one crisis to another. And finally…. Boris Johnson May be the next PM (again)!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 01:28:29'] This is the bait to lure in retail investors. Once the AI hype train runs out of steam, the institutionals and insiders will dump on our heads. This will end similarly to the 2000 Tech Bubble for investors. This time around, the big tech companies will probably survive, but the retail investors will be staring at massive unrealized losses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 01:02:23'] Prices in tech will not hold. The bottom was months ago but there will be one more fairly significant dip within 3 to 6 months and then it's off. That's after a rate decline not a pause. It's still forecasted that rates will be held or get hiked at least twice in the next 6 months.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 03:58:18'] TQQQ calls it is then.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 18:57:58'] I agree with the sentiment that the Big Tech rally will continue, as investors seek out stocks that offer both growth and stability in an uncertain economic environment. While a recession is always a possibility, I believe that the underlying fundamentals of these companies are strong enough to weather any storm.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 06:22:42'] So, short the market. Got it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 11:06:23'] Stock market is not the economy. The richest 1% of Americans own 53%, over half, of all the stocks and don't get affected by a recession

Apple is up +200% since he made that purchase back in 2016-2018 (reports indicate it was around this time). You don’t need to diversify when you’re up +200% on a $36B investment that pays $100m in divs every year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 11:03:31'] I agree. Stuffing trillions of dollars into stocks like $MSFT, $AAPL and $TSLA was simply not an efficient use of capital. I welcome this sell-off and reiterate your $120 price target on Apple within the next few weeks.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 11:57:39'] You aint alone, if you check all the open puts on apple a lot of people are betting on apple sinking. Put/call ratio was 0.81 yesterday.When ever i check the put / call ratio im baffled how many people are betting on calls in current market. Like so many are living the hopium dream for relief rally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-20 11:45:30'] I'm not sure why your mixing apple and Berkshire. Yes, buffet owns a lot of shares but he's not selling. The GAAP reporting will show a loss but buffet is a long term holder. Just look at Berkshires ev/ebita, shares outstanding, cash flow. He's making loads of tendies right now. Now, I would agree with you about Apple. It's metrics are also awesome but it's going to take a hit from supply chain and discretionary spending. The stimulus package brought forward a lot of sales and those people won't be upgrading anytime soon.Edit: if brk-b shares get close to 200 I'll be a buyer for sure

It is probably one of the lowest quality semi equipment companies out there.Ask yourself... what does Besi spend on research and development? A measley 7% of sales. Most semi equipment companies will spend 2 or even 3x that. This business has low barriers to entry and is waiting to be chewed up by lower cost competition.Buy ASML, or ASMI or a property semiconductor equipment company.

Massive red days on both CPI and FOMC that cycle...I see the same happening this month. Everyone thinks inflation is defeated, but we aren't even close. And will likely break through 10% later this year. Core hasn't really moved down, only volatile food and energy and a quick jump in energy will send us through the roof. Wouldn't be surprised to see a .3%+ higher inflation than expected this release and a very hawkish Fed pulling a 50 bps rate hike. Just what is needed to send the markets back to the lows of the cycle. Very big opportunities on puts! Don't be a sucker and get sucked into going long like all the sucker face bulls will!

They just implied it was because of De Santis because why not throw a jibe at him.Let's be serious, Disney wouldn't walk away from megamillions of profits because they want to make De Santis look bad, that'd be insane and actually could get them sued by their shareholders whom they have  a fiduciary duty to.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 20:26:22'] *"Are they poised to rise from the ashes of the current shit show with a freshly trimmed bottom line on costs and* ***a timeless brand****?"*It has taken more than half a century to build the brand equity of a "timeless brand." That brand equity is the wholesome family entertainment brand. For decades Disney and Pixar have been incorporating positive lessons on REAL inclusion, acceptance and tolerance in their films. The question is, will they have the confidence to keep true to what build that brand, or will they go chasing after fool's golf of the fashionable social trends of the day.Bob Iger wasn't brought back just come back to get the cost structure under control, the Board brought him back to reel in the disastrous lurch into wokism and divisive extremist identity politics, as that threatens to tarnish and impair that brand equity. Ironically, it is only Disney that can destroy the priceless Disney brand. The jury is out on whether they will.When they bought ESPN, it was the most powerful franchise in broadcast. But it lurched so far off the rails into racism and wokism that a huge part of its brand equity has been vaporized, and its viewership numbers have been massively flushed. I can't begin to tell you how many people I know who were huge ESPN "addicts," who are apolitical, middle of the road type people who eventually gave up and have gone elsewhere, they found it so unwatchable. Can Disney purge the extremist wokism from the ESPN brand before it tails into irrelevance? Warner Brothers Discovery faces a similar challenge with CNN. WBD has done a major purge, but they may have waited too late. It may never recover. I don't think it's too late for ESPN, but they're going to have to make a move.Ironically, a lot this depends on whether Iger has the mettle and good sense to rise above the button-punching divisiveness of the artificial political "battles." He has a big ego. It's in Disney's long term interest that he not take the DeSantis bait and stoop to engaging with him. DeSantis is not going to stop trying to suck him into a fight, so that Disney can become a prop for political divisiveness. Iger needs to ignore him, rather than knee-jerk in the opposite direction.If Disney can stick to the timeless themes that built the brand, it's going to do just fine over the long haul. If not, the jury's out.I'd add one other thing ... there's an unanswered question as to whether Iger really understands that old media companies are going to have to transition to new platforms. They've got to get their content ported to the world of gaming, and to the world of new world social media, including Tik Tok and YouTube.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 15:20:47'] If apple falls the whole market falls
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 10:23:15'] Last week we saw workers clash with police over at Foxconn over delayed bonus payments and working conditions related to covid 19 And on Thursday employees began an exodus  Foxconn essentially said they had an input error in the computer system where they were giving new hires contracts for existing workers and that new recruits would be paid what was promised to them    So Foxconn offered up these disgruntled protesting employees 10,000 yuan or about $1,400 in two installment payments to anyone who wanted to leave to ease tensions.     So now they have to replace the workers who decided to take the severance pay. This is worrisome because apple had already announced they would be seeing some delays. This way about 3 weeks ago. So now we’re seeing more issues in capacity over at Foxconn right around the holidays.   Keep in mind Apple is a large weight in ETF like QQQ and SPY  QQQ: 12.51%  SPY: 7.07%  Now to make this entire covid situation worse, we have these protest in xinjiang after a deadly fire in an apartment building killed 10 people. To elaborate on this, firefighters took longer to arrive to the scene because of covid 19 barricades and parked electric vehicles in narrow pathways that had lost power.    Now let’s talk about the crayon drawing.  Support: 138ish  Resistance: 150ish  50 day moving average: 146.53  200 day moving average: 154.60  Demand zone (green box): 127 to around 138, this is where you see people buying  Supply zone(red box) : around 158 to 150, this is where you see people selling    Right now, we’re sandwiched between the 50 day and the 200 day and if we lose the 50 day, we risk hitting the bottom support trend line. The first chart is showing a 10-year 1 day time frame.  The top and bottom trendlines “thicker red crayon lines” create a pennant. On the second chart, I show a shorter time frame. 30-day 30-minute time frame. You can see the rejections off the top trend line a little clearer. We had 3 rejections more recently. Also if we fall out of the pennant, we risk closing the gap we made a few days ago.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 11:45:53'] I hope Apple gets massacred like dotcom Cisco, they are overdue for one of the largest crashes of any stock ever, I wouldn't buy Apple 70% off, that would still be too expensive
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 13:30:29'] Honestly, I think all of this is instigated by Apple and Foxconn to cover up lower than expected sales.  If you create supply chain issues then it doesn’t look like a sales issue.  Tim Cook can call the CEO of Foxconn and ask him to fuck up the bonuses and cause some chaos.  No one would know if it’s a sales or supply issue.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 12:42:34'] Apple wasn’t gonna sell these phones anyways. It’s a good excuse to have low salesI bet they’ll still have extra inventory
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 15:12:56'] They already planned to shift operations to India, and Vietnam to diversify their production, after this I can see them increasing the amount and possibly going to more countries. Though, with what’s going on in China, I cannot blame people if they don’t want to work, the lockdowns are still rampant and peoples lives are being destroyed. And I’m sorry but even with an increase in pay like that cannot convince people to rush and risk their health.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-27 19:00:31'] There are some “made in India” iP14 pics floating around on social media so I think Tim is playing 4D chess against China right now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 01:20:05'] Sooner than later Apple will move their iPhone production to India and then Foxconn and China will have less money in their pockets. This is globalisation and bottom line profits matters.

Apple is tied so tightly to the US Economy that im guessing we are gonna have a red week next week, all the ETFs and funds that hold apple are gonna tank this week.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 09:15:06'] Nvidia is the new Tesla of WSB. They are already so high, and there are so many undervalued companies to bet on.How many Nvidia to the moon posts do we need?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 10:24:47'] Tesla Dojo is specific for their use cases which is training large models based on video data. It also does not exist yet, and won’t be useful for training large language models. The only alternative right now is Google TPUs and Nvidia has at least a 6x lead on them.   In the future there will be more players like you said but it’s not like Nvidia is just sitting on the sidelines,
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 09:33:10'] lolwut, cerebras is so cost prohibitive that nvidia looks cheap in comparison.also, not quite the same thing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 08:57:28'] Hmm.  I think you don’t understand the landscape. There will be commercially available and widely adopted/open source learning tools provided by nvidia. Everyone else is doing proprietary stuff and won’t get into being a chip manufacturer.You’ve got it wrong

Nvidia is going to take his big daddy gpu order with 90% margin to chip makers and chip makers have limited amount of wives. They will let nvidia fuck their wives and deprioritize other bulls. That means everyone using the same chip makers as nvidia will struggle more to fullfill orders and will likely see their margin drop. Which fabless swinger has the least margin right now? Thats qcom and they will get floored soon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 07:35:49'] I love how the world economy / stock market is essentially being propped up by slave labor at an overpriced phone manufacturer, and nobody cares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 00:39:13'] TL;DR: apple will give positive guidance for next quarter, citing imminent improvement in supply over this quarter. AAPL new ATH next ER.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-22 23:48:47'] Article text for those of you who are too poor to afford a subscription (I assume most of you degens):> Hundreds of workers at Apple Inc.’s main iPhone-making plant in China clashed with security personnel, as tensions boiled over after almost a month under tough restrictions intended to quash a Covid outbreak.> > Workers at the Foxconn Technology Group plant streamed out of dormitories in the early hours of Wednesday, jostling and pushing past the white-clad guards they vastly outnumbered, according to videos sent by a witness to portions of the protest. Several white-suited people pummeled a person lying on the ground with sticks in another clip. Onlookers yelled “fight, fight!” as throngs of people forced their way past barricades. At one point, several surrounded an occupied police car and began rocking the vehicle while screaming incoherently.> > The protest started overnight over unpaid wages and fears of spreading infection, according to the witness, asking to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. Several workers were injured and anti-riot police arrived on the scene Wednesday to restore order, the person added.> > In one video, irate workers surrounded a silent, downcast manager in a conference room to voice grievances and question their Covid test results. It wasn’t clear when the meeting took place.> > “I’m really scared about this place, we all could be Covid positive now,” a male worker said. “You are sending us to death,” another person said.> > A Foxconn representative declined to comment on the incident.> > The rare instances of violence at the plant in the central city of Zhengzhou reflects a build-up of tensions since the lockdown began in October. Many among the vast workforce of more than 200,000 at “iPhone City” have been plunged into isolation, forced to subsist on spartan meals and scrounge for medication. > > Many eventually fled the plant on foot last month. Foxconn and the local government appeared to have gotten the situation under control in recent weeks, promising unusually high wages to attract new staff and promising better working conditions.> > Wednesday morning’s protests suggest that is no longer the case. It underscores how Xi Jinping’s Covid Zero policy, which relies on swift lockdowns to stamp out the disease wherever it pops up, is increasingly weighing on the economy and throwing swathes of the global supply chain into disarray. Beijing recently issued new directives ordering officials to minimize disruption and use more targeted Covid controls, but surging outbreaks in major cities have forced local authorities to reach for strict curbs again.> > Violence has erupted sporadically across China over Covid restrictions. In May, hundreds of workers clashed with security personnel at Quanta Computer Inc.’s factory in Shanghai after they were barred for months from contact with the outside world, while protests have emerged in locked-down areas of Guangdong, the southern manufacturing hub.> > The Foxconn situation serves up another reminder of the dangers for Apple of relying on a vast production machine centered on China at a time of unpredictable policy and uncertain trade relations.> > Zhengzhou is the site of Apple’s most critical production, churning out an estimated four in five of its latest-generation handsets and the vast majority of the highest-end iPhone 14 Pro units. Apple warned this month that shipments of its newest premium iPhones will be lower than previously expected -- just ahead of the peak holiday season shopping.> > The sprawling compound has operated for weeks within a “closed loop,” or a self-contained bubble that limits contact with the outside world. That is keeping some production going. Apple and Foxconn have said they’re working to replace staff who’ve left and resume full production as soon as possible.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 13:19:56'] People are exiting banks and rushing to buy stocks. It is part of the plan.

Probably around September.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 17:10:15'] Well, what's happening is the bond market is wrong. They believe that we're still in the age of buy now pay later, bailouts, and inflation relief checks.The stock market's value of course is based on the past performance relative to the 10 year yield.Also, for some reason the bond market believes that there is suddenly an extreme risk of default for 1 month treasuries, while all the other stuff down the curve is safer and safer as the term gets longer.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 11:12:02'] I think recession is still in the future, trillions were printed by the Fed but also lent into existence by banks during low interest rate periods, inflation is just the boiling over point and it takes time to destroy money by paying off debt.  M2 is contracting but it will take time to contract what was printed. Some experts say soon, some by Q4, some by Q2 2024, some experts are saying the bottom was last October! I think nobody knows when exactly. It’s too complex but current conditions are slowing the economy and it is unknown if we’ve already gone too far. I think there could be a tipping point and a cascading effect going into recession and nobody knows if it already happened or is in the future. Having said that, I think Burry was on to something when he said it was a BTFD generation wherein people and investors just have more risk appetite and are able to tolerate higher PEs. It could be a new normal wherein a PE of 20 today is yesterday’s PE of 10 because the world has changed. Food and energy is plentiful, technology is advanced, trading is zero commission. It’s the best rationale, so I sold almost all my puts at WSB worthy loss porn yesterday and now more thoroughly into thetagang.Nobody knows anything.

There's record snowfall in Tahoe so we're keeping our fingers crossed that the snowmelt doesn't flood areas later this year. Hopefully it just replenishes all the reservoirs.

As these massive sums of wealth continue to grow beyond the widest gap we have ever seen in history those with money have no where else to park all that cash except the market. Then since they would rather borrow against instead of selling to avoid taxes prices continue to stay artificially propped up. Not gonna see a market that makes sense until that’s addressed

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 13:51:18'] >Apple is a great company and I love their products, but they need to be more aggressive in acquiring sports rights if they want to compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon. They've been relatively passive so far, only striking deals for baseball and soccer, but if they want to attract more viewers overseas they need to start offering more popular sports like football (soccer). The EFL has a deal with Sky, BT Sport, and Amazon for live games that runs through the 2024-2025 season. The Premier League sold domestic rights for 2022 to 2025 for $6.3 billion. Apple needs to get in on this action if they want to compete against the other streaming giants.

Including the Partnership Agreements and excluding terrestrial spectrum, the Company expects its total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 to range between $185 million to $230 million, depending in part upon the Company’s achievement of certain performance and other targets under the Partnership Agreements, generating an EBITDA margin of approximately 55%. The Company expects these financial metrics to continue to improve significantly by 2026, which is expected to be the first full year in which the new satellites are operational, with total revenue expected to increase by approximately 35% compared to the 2023 forecast driven primarily by revenue growth under the Partnership Agreements."

I know nothing about the company products really which is why I've tagged it a discussion.  I am not some neckbeard fanboy who has such a poor understanding of technology, he has to get a baby proofed computer with an outrageous monitor stand,  nor am I a yuppie wanna-be artist with my head stuck up my ass sitting at a coffee shop waiting for someone to compliment the apple logo on my devices and clothes.

AAPL is important because it is a Colossus (get it?) of the Tech industry.  It will influence other holdings, and we should discuss and prepare.\n2. AAPL has held up remarkably through this crash.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:18:17'] more bearish stuff, they have high forex exposure and strong dollar will fuck them over. Last ER they blames exchange rate, they can do the same again. It’s definitely not the apple product price cuts and sales they are doing in China that’s hurting margins. the average Chinese citizen needs no incentive and is flocking to buy an inferior spec phone in comparison to the Chinese phones with dual fucking chips is what apple is trying to convince US share holders. Heck they haven’t even provided guidance since covid yet people still view it as a “safe” company. The only reason the stock hadn’t collapse is share buy backs which is also why EPS is still strong because there’s less shares on the market…. Apple is a ticking time bomb the way they are burning their cash reserves to prop up stock price. If they run out of cash it dooms the company, if they stop buy backs it’ll doom the share price. One is short term demolition but survival at the end the other is permanent demolition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 12:59:51'] Really don't get the apple selling point beside it being a ridiculously well run company. Pixel 7 > iphone. As do Samsung's flagships imho. Ipads feel outdated to me, but suppose there's a market here. Chromebooks and ultrabooks are just so much better for almost all kinds of use than apple alternatives. Earpods are absolute crap compared to alternatives. Apple watch is neat, but the competition is equally good, and garmin is miles better if you are in any way active. Apple atm are just products bought due to eco system and the idea it's a statement product. When every poor joe has them the latter argument is gone sooner rather than later and eco system is so easy to change these days. When people actually try they are dumbfounded they didn't do it earlier. But I suppose they can become a company like ibm over time.

AAPL has massive cash position, as I use my crayon to pen this missive, their buyback program makes sense, and new N3 chip in upcoming iPhone 15 with new satellite antenna that will be critical.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-23 22:03:27'] I don't have much to say about it except for the design part which was invented by car companies that sold slightly better sometimes even same quality cars in different colors to create a market that leads people to buy a new car more often than needed. apple does it with round and sharp edges on their phones, car companies did it with different colors etc. There is a whole psychology about creating demand for something on a yearly basis that doesn't need to be changed every year and apple does it best. it's still the most popular phone amongst young people by far and more people want iphones even though it doesn't seem like it. don't have much to say about the rest but it's not stagnant or declining, it's rising ever so slightly. they started the design circle back after the release of the iphone 3G btw so it's not even a recent development. car manufacturers did it when they transitioned to modern looking cars with colors instead of creating new models in black like ford did when they started mass producing and it worked. the only reason cars and phones come in different shapes and sizes is to make people think that it's a trend they need to follow and it works, it always worked and in a globalized society where status matters it will keep working.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-07 13:28:44'] It's 80% up the past 6 months. This news have already been priced in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-07 12:32:49'] Some crude DD with no conclusion: As of the last quarterly report, GSAT has 762,000 subscribers with about $33M in service revenue/quarter. They have many levels of service depending on the device (voice \[$100/mo\], text only \[$18/mo\], beacon only\[<$10/mo\]). Sounds like Apple will offer a service somewhere between their text and beacon service. And, I'm sure apple will negotiate down the service cost substantially since most people will not use the service. Apple sells \~200 million iphones/year, which will increase globalstars potential subscriber base by 250x, this will probably take a few years to realize as people upgrade to newer phones. Apple is also taking most of the cost of increasing service capacity (95% of new capital expenses).

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 10:34:23'] Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; https://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/If anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask.

Their position right now makes the tension over Taiwan far hottter, and now a systemic risk for every major economic power.If you've got a 10-15-year horizon, the market will resettle with them competing much closer to parity with several regional/national champions, fed by virtually limitless cash from Washington or Beijing or Brussels for security reasons.So I'd say short TSMC and long INTC.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:31:36'] Well you're right about generational, pretty sure my dad was buying them for the same price they are now over a decade ago. Grandpa was doing the same decades before that...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 08:38:39'] I believe you are correct on point 1 with the processing nodes. However, your second point I believe is way off.Nvidia and its CUDA software stack are far better than anything out there on offer. AMD, Intel, and others dropped the ball years ago when they didn't properly support and push for OpenCL. It doesn't help that Nvidia never fully supported it and actively made it the poorer choice performance wise for their cards. It's so bad that OpenCL 3 is actually a rollback to OpenCL 1.2 and makes everything from OpenCL 2 optional.So now, with the failure of OpenCL AMD and Intel have decided on their own proprietary implementations. These will take longer than 2 years to catch up to Nvidia, if they ever do.Just my two cents.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 14:33:05'] He's right people.And INTC is nowhere near the p/e of NVDA or AMDAlso, they pumped bigly on a big loss last earnings (beat, but still a loss).

If x86 dies because of ARM or RISC V, AMD is going down too in the CPU segment. But Intel can still build chips for other architectures.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 13:50:36'] You could have the bigger picture, however just because all of these factors pan out, doesn’t necessarily mean Intel is a good long term investment. They are terrible capital allocators. Plus their runway as a 100+Billion dollar company isn’t extremely high. Intel could command a higher market share, and they easily could improve in other aspects as a company. However if they cannot properly reinvest in the business, you likely aren’t going to get an adequate return on your investment.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 15:19:50'] They’re all leaving.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:13:15'] Elon fucked up so badly trying to pander to the far right. Now leftist, the people who bought his shitty cars, hate him. On top of that, the people he is pandering to aren't going to trade in their gas-guzzling trucks for an EV. This is worse than Bud Light pissing off their base.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 17:44:26'] How long before Musk starts unloading Tesla stock?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 16:17:40'] Smaller slice of a bigger pie. They sold about 10k more cars in Q1 of 2023 than Q1 2022 in California.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:27:26'] Hot Take: Tesla won't be around by 2030
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:13:24'] Huge price cuts and slowing growth paints a picture of market saturation. People that want a Tesla own one. Some will buy another, but there’s a lot more competition now. Tesla has some unique advantages, but there’s plenty to be dissatisfied about as well.Teslas solar business is about to take a hit with the end of solar friendly policies in California. Tesla moving its headquarters out of California was stupid, regulators are taking a much more critical look at the safety of its autopilot and FSD. A California driver was recently convicted of a felony for an accident that happened while using FSD. Teslas driverless car tech is a fantasy if they are not the ones held responsible when it failsThere is just so much wrong with how Tesla is valued…
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 12:59:25'] Maybe if it's not overpriced in California it's not elite enough and will not sell.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 16:21:20'] Cybertruck is a joke. It's repellent and priced so low that no one could ever believe it would be that cheap to buy.If the Tusk had just made an average, ordinary SUV he could have dominated the plug-in market in a few years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 12:56:09'] >Tesla's market share in California is falling, despite aggressive price cuts. This indicates that demand for Tesla vehicles may be waning in the state. This could have negative implications for the company's sales and profitability going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 19:11:11'] Tumbles?  Wow I didn’t realize deliveries went down!  Try a search for Tesla deliveries over the past five years.  Driving, there are more and more Tesla cars on the road.  Still best (and fastest) electric or nonelectric vehicles on the market, don’t care what Elon does.  Drive 200 miles for like $9 charge that takes 15 minutes while watching Netflix or TikTok, no issues there.   Fun to drive, and yes self driving is pretty great, just got the update to Tesla vision.  Funny how statistics can be made up.  Just compare margins w ford or gm or Toyota or anyone else.  And no Tesla not just an automaker, energy storage and solar still ramping huge, more factories being built and planned.  Tesla haters can just watch stock price over next few years or hold it and watch their accounts grow.  It’s not over yet, just getting started!  400 shares at $160, LFG!
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 13:53:43'] It's partly due to liberals not liking Elon these days, but I also think that most people just don't want EVs yet.  Combine that with increased competition, and Tesla is bound to lose market share.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 16:21:31'] There's a lot of used Tesla's piling up for sale. As Tesla lowers their prices, the used alternatives become more attractive.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 04:09:33'] The attention span and short term memory around here is amazing. I am not a fan boy I am a fan of making money. Tesla was going to $30 all the haters say lol . Got beat down to $108 in Jan 2023 rose 100% in a couple of month's . Now it is Retracing .Tesla margins even with the consolidation 5x +++ Ford and GM .  I am a huge Ford fan (over 7,ooo shares)Musk can price them out and that is exactly what he is doing. It is simple math he wants to control  market share. All the majors are in their infancy as far as EVs go. Tesla is 10x more mature Battery wise charging wise ETC, Musk wants to grab it now and will pay up to do it. We shall see ?? but one thing I know show me an emotional investor and 90% of the time I will show you someone who lets his emotions steal his money. I could give a fuck less what Musk says . He is going to drive the model 3 price down to Chevy volt range and then watch what happens :)
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 04:38:17'] Honestly the company would be fine if market cap drops by 80%
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 04:54:24'] So a lot of new electric cars from different companies are hitting the market and you’re surprised Tesla is selling less??  Deep man

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-28 21:40:13'] On luxury goods like Tesla I actually think that it’s a sign of weakness to the consumer that they have to announce price cuts. People like buying status.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 22:17:53'] You can look at musks behavior (and tsla California sales) in 1 of 2 ways. Either his rightward shift has alienated potential buyers thus leading to the sales slowdown. OR Tesla has saturated their market, and Musks rightward shift is an attempt to find new buyers. Either way, not good.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 22:59:57'] This was always inevitable. Toughest question is timing your puts right.

We just had two green bar days back to back, so I would imagine some red tomorrow one way or another. Either in morning or afternoon.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 15:41:16'] if Macro environment was looking good then this would be a positive sign in a boom, the spy is not going to make a new ATH... the DXY fell and that's why stocks are in a rally.... alot of stocks are down on earnings and the economy is weak, I'm looking at oil on the raise back up and I expect inflation to creep back in as we get closer to $100 a barrel again... Pakistan is in the shit and so is the UK, global recession is virtually here now and China has just downgraded its GDP growth too, expect a rejection this week back under 4000 points on the SPY... sales are still on the decline, I see the rally as a classic BUY THE DIP move and positive optimism from the FED with another 25 point raise and not a 50 point raise this month, I think they should go 50 to speed up this recession... the whole go hard and go early strategy, they are taking a more controlled approach going slow and steady monitoring the effects of the raises in slower increments.... Everyone's watching the inflation rate when they should just be watching the price of oil instead... if oil gers back over $100 per barrel, inflation will raise back to around 6% and this will cause a drawn out recession until oil returns to $50-60 per barrel.... I think market sentiment right now has everyone a little to optimistic with AI in tech, until it can be monetized which is at least a year or two away I don't think it will do much, it's a hype train right now and will lose momentum, Company's everywhere are slashing jobs and slashing Dividends to cover debt and hold share prices, ultimately that over the long term drives an economy down so I don't really see a recovery in the stock market at March 2023 just because we had some stupid golden cross and you think that's an indicator to invest in because some moving averages passed each other, yes it would be a positive sign but don't confuse a bear market rally with an actual bull market rally.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 14:39:53'] Can't say it enough...you are amazing with what you provide as far as charting!!! Thanks!! You are a true Untold hero of WSB.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 14:37:20'] So many charts and graphs and words it must be true, didn’t read all of it though
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 14:40:36'] I think that the psychology of markets is sometimes detached from TA. I know they often feed off one another, but the fact that the RSI is low and it seems like we’re “due for a bounce” just doesn’t do it for me. I think that we are entering the panic piece of the cycle next week and I do believe next week is the beginning of capitulation. Bloomberg will be mongering that we just closed at new lows and below the 200 weeklies and there is no good news to cause it to go up. Your average investor that only tracks headlines is likely feeling extreme fear right now. 2008 here we come, just my opinion. Of course I’m biased cause I’ve been holding QQQ $250 march 2023 puts since may. As always thanks for the TA. I think the temporary bottom for QQQ is $217 which is that multi year trend line tracing the bottoms of 2018 and 2020 corrections.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 16:44:15'] OP thanks as always for your in-depth analysis. I swear I’m on your page every day shortly after market close excited to see what you have to say. Wishing you and your family many blessings, especially in these crazy times!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 15:10:47'] I believe we are getting a rally next week (finally?). Spx finally hit a new low and hitting the resistance of 9/2/2021 the bounce from covid low, which is the support level where we landed today (can't be a coincidence right?). Unless something crazy happen again on Monday or Tuesday, I think we are finally getting a long rally either monday or tuesday.Of course if we break lower, none of this would hold true.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 14:37:48'] I think TSLA held up relatively well in anticipation of delivery numbers over this weekend, could be a catalyst for some short-term upside
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 15:10:00'] Congratulations on a great week. I think it's too early for a complete meltdown and we see a decent bounce soon. I don't think we will see capitulation this year...
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 16:52:55'] Bought calls at the end. I dont trade opex so nothing today. I think the risk/reward benefits the calls so thats where I went. See a little divergence. Have a hunch we go up 2-3% and basically trade sideways until earnings start to trickle in mid Oct. First terrible earnings and I think we drop. Opposite would be true as well. Again, this is based on solely “I think it will happen”. So no better than a coin flip. Ill post losses on MondayNice trading this month
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 15:57:32'] I thought this afternoon was going to be the bounce up to burn puts. So i definitely got in early, wish i wouldve played it safe. I have NOV and DEC calls though but it hurts being down 20% off rip...
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 16:22:24'] Regarding the collar — it looks like they adjusted it.44.5k volume on 2860P/3880P/3835C; 89k volume on 2890P/3425P/3870C.I believe they likely bought the 2890/3425/3870 collar and then, after market dumped, sold it and bought a new one at 2860/3390/3835. (Explains the 44.5k and 89k volumes anyways.)Someone else appears to have bought or sold a strangle at 3k volume on a 2930P / 3800C.FYI
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 19:58:36'] Lehman collapse in 2008 and covid in 2020 are big catalysts. We need that level of a catalyst for capitulation imo. Right now I could see nukes or maybe credit suisse collapse. Wouldn't mind a rally for old time's sake.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 15:15:11'] To me that close really did shake what I thought we’d see next week and that JPM collar doesn’t help either. Close looks to me like we’re about to start next leg down but the collar looks like they’re anticipating a bounce from here or down to 3425 then bounce to 3870 and finally a leg down to 2890.Great work with the TA!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 16:38:52'] I loved this.  350 next week but I think we don’t have that massacre type week until the week after next.  Cpi report coming up will be the catalyst
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 21:23:44'] Not a great day for me. Had a good week but today definitely soured it. Had puts that got crushed on the morning jump. Closed for loss and scalped a call near the top. Opened up puts around the top again before the drop but was to concerned of a bounce back up that I closed earlier. Had I waited a min longer the puts would of pushed me back to green on the day. Opened up a couple calls around 360 when it looked like it would hold. Should of closed at 361ish rejection. Closed for a loss near 359 low 360. Picked up a 355p for Monday sold at 358 figured that would hold proceed to break down more. Rough day. Overall 600 lost. Holding originally positions of puts would of paid well. Looking for a bounce Monday to enter a nov put.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 00:04:18'] I'm in agreement with you on that hypothesis that we may see a temporary bottom at 357 and push up for a week or two, at least even with choppy price action til mid October. Then we'll probably leg down to the low 340s once majority retail realizes even tech is uber fucked. Great analysis as always, appreciate it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 02:43:40'] Plus gas prices are starting to go back to again. With releasing from the oil reserve ending this month and winter coming, it doesn't bode well for the cpi numbers released in November. A rational market would be very red this week but the market is far from rational these days
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 13:02:10'] I for once caught the top perfectly at $365.90 and bought $351 weekly puts expiring Friday October 7. I was up to $700 on that midday dump, then that midday chop, gains dropped to $300. My plan was to hold regardless, at least until Monday for that what if drop, but sold midday just before it dumped to the $360s. Ugg i was so mad lol 😝 my new strategy is buying puts on every rally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 16:14:46'] I think one thing to keep in mind about this sell off is that we are coming off a pretty crazy rally that many would argue that was unwarranted. Had we only rallied to 390 or 400 back in august following the previous patterns. We would be looking at 340-350 for the next bounce. The higher we go, the further we can fall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 14:56:35'] I hope Spy hits the black bear channel support soon for my Puts sake 🐻 or I’ll be happy with the -1% opening on Monday
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 17:25:32'] Something about the selloff this week just smells…off? Idk I had been looking for a bounce all week but the only one we got was a one day bailout from the BOE, and that morning before the BOE announcement it had looked like the whole market was going to break down from the Apple report. 360 support held several times but every rally attempt got shut down so fast this week, and then we got a weird close EOD today that looked kind of panicked. I really hate spewing conspiracist-type shit but the price action almost feels like someone knows something that the rest of us don’t. Maybe we end up rallying next week anyway (which wouldn’t shock me) but the way we finished today felt so bearish that I can’t help but think next week is going to be quite red. All bets are off I guess
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 15:57:14'] Sleepy VIX lulled me into a December call position mid day today. I'm hoping for a bounce next week. The previous June 17th low was also a Friday, but that selloff EOD didn't inspire confidence.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 16:08:58'] Nice job on the gainz dd. Ended flat for the month. Got rekt and paper handed on the bounce before cpi release. Just going to hand sit till we bottom. Calls or tqqq?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 17:29:12'] Thanks for your dedication in sharing your view and trades with us. I enjoy your write ups. The overall market looks the weakest it’s been all year and there is so much short interest it’s hard to imagine a flash/mini crash happening right now. Most are expecting it; I think we will see capitulation once inflation has starved out most average investors and they are cash strapped. Time will tell. Thanks again DD
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 19:13:40'] Wasn't the previous collar at 3850p? Massive amounts of deep ITM puts traded over the last couple days. Like upwards of $150M per transaction put positions at extremely deep ITM trades with high delta. Didn't have time to check OI on these today but didn't seem to carry day to day previously. JPM might have forced the previous collar into profit with MM hedging.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 19:28:41'] Great analysis 👍, Thank you .
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 21:48:39'] Can you also tell the downside on QQQ for next week? I have 255$ put sells expiring Friday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-01 14:31:32'] Went with 11/4 spy calls on Friday. These are going to get wrecked or be hugely profitable next week. Don’t have too much confidence right now tho

I have seen many of your TA's and noticed that you never mention MACD or RSI. Are these not factors you use to determine entry/exit points? Just getting into TA myself now and trying to teach myself. If you do use them, what settings do you use? I assume you use 5 minute candles for day trading. So what do you have your MACD? Thanks.

They have definitely pissed of the gaming community with the new 40 series cards and plus PC sales are all time low. Also AI or LLMs training does not need Nvidia specifically it can be done on AMD chips, Intel chips (will take ages ofc) and Google's tensor chips.Cloud demand is also on a slump, so AWS and Azure orders for the new datacenter specific cards depends on these demands.Vendors are pissed off as well for example look at the EVGA fiasco.I just don't see them bringing in enough revenue to match current prices, the market is way too bullish on Nvidia.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:11:00'] It’s just unplayable from here. A run up like that would have me looking for at least a 25% or 50% retracement. Too much about AI right now seems like .com in the 90s. It’s a show I’ll watch but not entertain with real money betting on up or down

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 15:38:53'] Nvidia would need to roughly 13x their profits in those 2 years to justify that price. And that's giving a generous PE of 30.Do you see this increasing profits at least 1200% in 2 years?Forward EPS has them 3.5xing profits this year. So you're expecting 10x (of current profits) the year after?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:56:08'] I’m very cautious now. I put a ton into NVDA last Feb (22) at $277 because everyone and market said it would go to $350. Then it just kept crashing to like $140 I think. I’m very surprised to see it’s still going up, I’m just waiting for the AI Bubble to burst like META did. Thankfully I didn’t end up loosing everything because it went back up but also didn’t gain anything. I think I might sit, the economy has to come crashing down eventually
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 14:21:25'] >Why $700 next year:* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year. The market has already priced this in. * AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI (see my previous post). However, I believe that GOOGL and MSFT have more downside than upside potential due to antitrust concerns. This leaves NVDA as the best pick in the space. Additionally, since a large portion of its revenue is derived from data center sales, it is less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn compared to other tech companies. Therefore, I believe that NVDA will outperform the market in both good and bad times which makes it a great long term investment. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time * FOMO - All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon eventually pushing prices even higher .This could add another 60%+to today's value giving us a target price of around $700

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 15:39:11'] Apple is up .50 cents after hours, that’s nothing to surprising.  Lulu is up $43 after hours because of good 1st quarter results.  Will probably do well 2nd quarter as people are still living an inflated standard of living by hammering credit cards.  Those credit cards will only last a few more months before they are tapped out and people can’t refi their home to get more cash.  I would say the effects will show up in 4th quarter 2023 2nd quarter 2024.  At which point we will see these jumps turn into dips.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-27 12:08:21'] I will never understand why anyone sticks with apple when their products are inferior and they pull shit like this. I've always had and preferred Android/Samsung, but if they had started intentionally making it harder for me to charge my stuff just so I would shell out even more money (on top of the hundreds for the device itself) I would stop buying their products immediately because I don't like being taken advantage of. Couple that with the fact that iphones screens still break super easily if you drop them when every other company seems to have figured out how to make them more durable, and I just can't wrap my mind around it.

We dont have that now and AI is still thriving.\n\nMost companies that did go public had zero earnings or value just hoping to capitalize on the boom.\n\nThis isnt the same. AI has been around for a while, for example IBMs Watson, A'

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 16:50:44'] >I agree with your assessment of the Dot Com bubble. The primary difference between then and now is that AI is much more developed and widespread than it was during the Dot Com era. Today, companies are better prepared to implement AI into their operations, and there is a greater understanding of how AI can be used to improve efficiency and productivity. As such, I believe that the current "AI boom" is not a bubble, but rather a genuine revolution that will change the way we live and work forever.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 09:27:40'] Elon is wrong calling the App Store fears a “hidden tax”.  A tax would go to the government – – this is a fee that goes to Apple or Google which are corporations, not government.  Musk espouses free-market principles, but in this case he is opposing the free market— After all, a corporation will charge whatever the market will bear.  Personally, I think Elon has painted himself into a corner.  The Twitter saga is turning into a disaster, and I think this will be his first huge loss.

This is really crazy when it comes to innovation and competition.  Musk has got his hands full.  People said Tesla would fail and I believed them for a long time.  Then I bought a model Y 18 months ago,  it’s the best car I’ve ever had and it’s a lot of fun.

It will be Florida v Disney 2.0. I don't know if this threat will be enough to prevent any ban but it may make them think twice about it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 16:44:31'] You guys probably need to check other markets. A weaker dollar throughout the week plus a stabilizing bond market is really giving me vibes that a huge sell off is unlikely. We might even run into a slightly hotter inflation number and still rally. At some point the market should realize that one inflation report is not a huge deal as the Fed is not basing their rate hike decisions on just one report.That being said I did throw some very low probability put spreads as hedges should something horrible happens
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 16:06:15'] I went long yesterday as we crossed $385 and stalled: SPY $350p 12/2 and UVXY $12c 11/18. Not all in, but a little larger than normal. With no clear “mandate” from the voters I suspect we’re going to start reading the word “recession” more and more and the debate around 100bps will hit the media soon (if not tomorrow). If not…you’re probably right $420 eoy and it’s Q4 earnings in the new year that wreck us.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 15:17:49'] Remember September's CPI report was proceeded by around -1.3% SPY the day before, the report came in just a little spicier than expected. Market dumped -2.5% in PM only to recover over 5% throughout the day.So here's to what I am assuming will be an extremely volatile and confusing day. I sort of wish I would have gone all cash today. I also have somewhat credible sources that have stated we were pushed to the short end of a majority of the existing strangles/straddles leading into tomorrow, but I have not spent the time confirming this. Today could have been a push to bring those short legs into profit. Also seems to be more strength in overall bullish positioning.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-09 14:18:40'] Did you see the falling wedge on the daily today? AH seems to have broken to the upside, I’m eying 378-385 by tomorrow before coming back down again. After forming a double top.Yeah I was too scared to enter with SPY being oversold but it still pushed down lower. I’m guessing longs were covering and shorts were gambling.

BoE QE was the primer but if we get a bullish read off the GDP I think markets will use that to fill all the gaps above us and make an appearance at 380-390 before we snap back to reality. Then again apparently UK almost had their own 2008 moment today so that might indicate the actual crash is closer than we would all think.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 08:49:01'] I'd say hold, but keep in mind that I am a random retard redditor who has only ever lost money on stocks
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 09:09:04'] In general, this is good position. At least once a month we have OPEX, so you have at least one profit-taking or hedging sell-off. Meanwhile, you will probably be looking at these dates for disasters.* On Monday Jim Cramer is opening NYSE and I've a comment that max paint level for Monday is SPY 377 :)* On July 20th you have Tesla earnings and every Wednesday is a expiration for VIX options, so big players have to buy new puts to re-hedge.* July 28th is AMZN and AAPL earnings. The thesis is that besides inflation that already hit, high oil prices will affect any delivery service, including FDX, UPS, AMZN, this is why you saw Bezos winning on Twitter that Biden doesn't understand the economy. Also, saudis can't increase oil production like Biden wanted, so oil is going up again.* Having said above, there is still a chance for SPY to bounce to 390 or even 400 before sell-off, so ideally you'd need to have some cash to average down.Disclaimer: I'm holding monthly UVXY for August @ 13

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 13:16:26'] Hold that why would you sell it? You have massive bearish catalyst over the next few weeks as well as earnings. Apple absolutely crush their last earnings and barely moved and the market was much better looking .they also basically said "well we killed it but don't expect us to do it again cuz supply chain stuff and we're having issues in China" and that was before China locked it down the last time .

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-17 08:13:55'] Next time take 30% of your put and buy a call along with it in case the trade goes into the opposite direction you will not lose all your money. Also I would recommend going further out. Three months at a minimum.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 08:49:03'] Hold. This is going down. Remember every rate hike takes effect one year later. So every month will be worse and worse for the markets until they break.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 09:19:24'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 09:05:44'] I would bet it goes to 155 by july28 after that it could go either way. I'd buy calls to collect on run up to earnings sell before reporting then be ready to unload puts if earing and guidance don't go in your favor.  But I also own the stock as a long term investment
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 09:35:11'] sold dude, appl is going to crush earnings and guidance wont be that bad given the demand for their product is strong af

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 10:57:31'] Analysis: Apple price will go up in next couple of days. Probably it will touch $162, then it might go down a bit and then start going up again. Not a good idea to buy Put or shorting any contracts.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-16 12:55:13'] its up to you to decide either accept loss & cut or hold. you could try avg down but that could cause more damage as well.  Next time learn to cut loss sooner  (say 20%) and as well take profit with defined limit and leave 1 runner. Always runs has to have stop loss at break even. Yours is just 14%. So you can try holding little longer But know that since CPI is out, Market will bounce higher before it starts reversing again. All the best. You could also hedge your position with buying calls to counter trade the loss. but again more risky.

If you make a trade for $1000 and profit 300 or lose $300, the next buy size should still be $1000. Dont make it, 1300 or god forbid more, just to try to make back by size what you can make back more safely over time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 16:29:51'] With all this going for you, there are a few caveats that are different now from the June reversal. The forecast for Fed Funds was 3.25 to 3.5 now out to December 4.25 and into March 23 4.5 to 4.75.Long bonds are still declining with them hitting 3.73 and the 10 yr over 4 now. Most other major currencies are hitting their lowest levels ever against the dollar or multi decade lows. A rally would be good for a reset to sell into for continued declines below June lows. Then see how low is low. If it can't rally much or it consolidates sideways before it breaks that make it very interesting also.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 19:05:56'] A rally isn't out of the picture because this is a bear market still. So any reason to spook shorts will result in a rally. I just wouldn't bet on one before we see the VIX crush and the dollar move down. At this point though the macro environment is very uncertain and the dollar moving down too much might create a bigger problem; higher inflation. I don't see any sustainable bullish outcomes until we have a bigger correction in equities and bonds find a tradable bottom.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-26 21:18:55'] You know this Mumbo Jumbo about trend lines assumes that there is a rational system running a long time with consistent patterns.  We are in a new macro-economic situation and the history is not relevant.  We are in massive QT at $90B per month, we have a seller that owns 10% of the market value exiting.  At the same time we have growing interest rates, in an attempt to fight supply side inflation, which only works when people are too broke or too scared to buy stuff.  This exact situation has happened never.  Analyzing past charts is like looking at bow and arrow tactics to build strategy for aircraft carriers, planes and tanks.Don’t believe me, watch…Tomorrow red,Day after red,Day after red,Rinse and repeat.Maybe we will have a few small green blips as the fed moderates selling, but otherwise hold on for the drop. We haven’t even seen impacts in earnings yet.This ride ends when QT ends and inflation drops below 3%.  QT will take until Feb 2024 to unwind QE.Have a nice day.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 15:49:14'] I think a lot of people fail to realize that we have significant inflation and that most companies reporting earnings show signs of this and then people lose their minds when the company doesn’t meet expectations. 3rd quarter earnings shouldn’t be that profitable with the fed doing rate hikes. It just wouldn’t be logical and to top it off we are going into a recession. I honestly would be shocked if Apple is above expectations but everything I’ve read says otherwise.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 22:41:28'] I agree on meta but to be honest with you the iPhone is one of the most staple consumer items in the past 10 years. iPhones are constantly being replaced and every year a new one comes out and people replace their phone just to get the new version of practically the same shit. While that might not be the case during recession I still think that Samsung isn't about to corner the market anytime soon and google and windows phone are dogshit so..

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 14:55:21'] Congrats!Don't forget PPI tomorrow before FOMC minutes. Usually PPI comes out after CPI, and PPI indicates what inflation businesses are seeing which could translate into what they're willing to pass on to consumers. We truly could get the capitulation that bears have been looking for with the BoE news, an unchanged/bad CPI miss, and really poor bank earnings all in the last 2 days of this week. TSLA to 170 if things hold as they are, AAPL to 131 - 133, and MSFT below 220. Too much anxiety in this market this week

Throw in the BOE stuff and I wonder if even a good CPI can get markets to go up.It just seems too perfect of a setup for a dump. I’m holding puts, but it seems too good to be true. Hard to get a gauge thanks to the BOE.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 17:33:53'] The market won’t dump because everyone is expecting it to dump. The market needs to be surprised to shit the bed, as we saw with the last CPI print and major core miss. Core may miss, but I think it’s priced in.In fact I think inflation will once again drop, and core will not rise as much as last time. (.1>.2 increase) Market sees this as bullish and rally’s. I think that we need to see piss poor earnings in Q3 and Q4, we need to see guidance and revenues pulled back on the big caps and a true devaluing of assets for a mega dump.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 18:00:30'] Agreed.  Market seems tense. All rallies are being sold relatively quickly, even though were seem oversold. Im more interested in the PPI report on the 12th than the CPI data. I think we are going to see A LOT of movement at the end of the week especially with a few bank earnings. That being said I bought a 14DTE SPX call 30 min before close. Im hoping we rally tomorrow so I can pick up some 2 week puts for cheaper straddle. So it will probably tank tomorrow lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 21:26:46'] I've been buying cheap TSLA 185 puts expiring 10/14. Got 15 now with an average just under 0.20. Fell asleep waiting for a good trade today and woke up at close to see they are up 33% already. This was meant to be a lotto play, not my main play for CPI but it just might turn into something massive. Debating selling tomorrow to ensure profit or letting it ride. Again, cheap play that I was fully expecting to hold until Thursday otherwise of course I would have taken profits already.Edit: Looks like the decision will be made for me. $3 jump at the open of PM.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 17:12:39'] It is possible to create a Python app that communicates with the Robinhood API and the Apple Watch via SMS. The basic idea would be to use the Python app to interact with the Robinhood API and retrieve information about the user's account and the options they want to trade. The app could then send SMS messages to the user's Apple Watch, which would display the information and allow the user to execute trades by sending SMS commands back to the app.Here's a possible workflow for this approach:1. The user launches the Python app on their computer and logs in to their Robinhood account.2. The app retrieves information about the user's account, including their available cash and the options they have available to trade.3. The app sends an SMS message to the user's Apple Watch, which displays the account information and a list of available options.4. The user selects an option to trade by sending an SMS command back to the app, such as "Buy XYZ" or "Sell ABC."5. The app executes the trade and sends an SMS confirmation to the user's Apple Watch.It's important to note that this approach would require the user to have a Robinhood account and also a python environment set up on their computer to run the app.

POST: ['2022-11-01 13:35:35'] POST TITLE: b'11-1-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA'
POST_TEXT: b'It was the night before FOMC and all through the markets there was oddities I had mentioned last night actually in my TA that I expect at some point markets were going to get shocked by a big drop intraday instead of this recovery rip that day was today. \n\nThe interesting thing about today is that VOLD (volume) actually came in bullish at open and through the whole day pretty much until right before power hour VOLD was actually in extreme bull momentum. Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. \n\nThe other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didnt spike) since the June FOMCs. The last two FOMCs were the first with a spike of the VIX the day before. \n\nWhat does that mean ? well im not quite sure but '

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 13:51:42'] Why in your TA did you ignore the possible bearish case and only focus on a possible upside swing?  Couldn't you also draw a trend line from the 8/16/2022 peak to 11/1/2022 peak as an overall bearish trend?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-01 14:39:52'] i think we can see a 100bps tmr because of that Biden article. So at first it was Biden saying he supports a fed pivot then it was corrected to Biden supporting a hawkish pivot aka more hawkish fed is what Biden is calling for.This is just days after begging Powell to turn dovish. Imo Biden failed to convince papa Powell to pivot so if u can’t beat em u join em

As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. \n\nI wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. \n\nJanuary the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  \n April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   \n August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.\n\nThat means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at'

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 14:50:41'] >It was a great week for me. I made a ton of money and insulted a lot of poor people.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 16:15:16'] I also had my best week ever, thanks to my best day ever (Thursday). I have a goal to average + $1000/day. I made $32540 this week.However, there's about a 50% chance I'll give back about half of that on some 395, 396 and 403 puts I bought today. A friend wanted to buy calls today, all excited about it, and I told him the time to be buying calls was wednesday or maybe right at open Thursday. After SPY jumping 6% in two days, why TF would you want to buy calls?So now I'm in "wait and watch" mode for Monday. Until I'm fairly certain of which direction we're going in the short term, I'm strictly an observer.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 17:15:07'] I agree with your analysis. You can go long or short. No reason to sell but if the Fed governors start talking again or the war in Ukraine , taiwan war we could go down big in a flash.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 18:09:52'] Like you, I let a few SPX plays run past the 20% stop loss. One they were at 40% loss, I kept convincing myself they'd rebound and I could get out even. Staying disciplined is the hardest part of trading. The times when it DOES rebound into a profitable position are dangerous because they set a false expectation. My week turned red because of this lack of discipline on Wednesday. Could and should have been green. Fuck emotions. On to next week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 13:39:11'] We got TGT, WMT, HD earnings Tuesday premarket Could see slightly up/flat on Monday, hit that 200 ema around 402 like you said Then we get these earnings and we see consumer spending is in trouble with a profit warning for the holiday quarter? Recession talk back to the forefront I could see that sending the market back down. Combined with several Fed members talking about necessity of raising terminal rate above 5% that the market has completely ignored, that could bring us to 340 by EOY.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 17:30:14'] I think we won’t see any big events but a combination of FED speakers talk the rally down and possibly a liquidity crisis due to shitcoin

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 07:12:16'] Nice wins.  I got wiped on cpi, but luckily didn’t stay a stubborn bear and cut what I could and proceeded to make some bullish plays that allowed me to break even.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-12 11:43:17'] The F&G index, like every technical indicator, is a lagging one. So, I'm not really subscribing to your theory that the current "peak" is signaling an incoming local top before the next leg down. Especially considering that there are no major economic developments/news coming out before December FOMC, so not sure what can stifle this insane rally. We could possibly rally all of November similar to how we did in March and July of this year after "better" newsI do think there are some considerable curveballs between now and December FOMC though. Things like midterm results (which are still being counted; really close race in the senate) and the whole FTX fiasco (who knows what the full effects of the "crip toe" crash will be). Overall, gotta say I'm bullish for at least next week. Swinging calls
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 19:52:35'] Tesla normally squeezes a lot harder on weeks like this. It typically leads the market on insane rallies. This week it lagged.  I think it moved with the market but is going back to selling next week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 15:25:55'] Isn’t today because of short squeeze?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 17:07:33'] Musk needs to stop selling shares in order to pay for Schwitter. SPY, AAPL, and the rest of the market are huge green dildos all around while TSLA is a sad droopy turd. All because its CEO is a bored autist who wanted to own a social media company. The funny thing is he might actually be horrible at running twitter since he doesn't know the first thing about running a profitable social media company.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 18:02:36'] I worry about Joe Biden. I have no idea how the 80 year old man keeps going. It's probably the one catalyst no one can time or is thinking about. I did some research on presidential deaths in office and how the stock market performed. We will be ok if it's a Kennedy move. Down 2% on first day Market was open but lbj did one heck of a job and market rallied another 20% over the next 6 months. Nixon back in 1974 scares the heck out of me. Dropped 6% on day he resigned continued down another 30% over next 18 months before bear market broke. Lots of similarities between 1974 and 2022. Almost de ja vu. Hope kamala does a good job. As far as the call collar for jpm isn't terribly positioned. It's going to be interesting to see if they will have to roll it. Just as the market goes down when they sell it. The Market will rip if they roll.

POST_TEXT: b'Well lets go ahead and get this out of the way yes I bought calls over night and yes I was hella wrong. Inflation had peaked per CPI as I expected coming in a 8.3% vs. 8.5% previous, however, market honed in on year over year and month over month core. Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some this is why plays like that should be small in size. \n\nThe worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast the psyops continue. \n\nAnyways moving on! Today was the worst day in the markets since the June 2020 the Covid crash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z8ca3rwxton91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=81e1a67c90d1fe36494eb021b796d5e1a922ef99\n\nToday was the 5t'

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:13:38'] Hey.... me again...I'm aware that this is going to come off as arrogant even though that is not my intention, but I did call this happening last week.. almost to a T. QQQ/spy did touch a little over the levels I was expecting, but not by much.. Glad you were able to recoup some of your money though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:12:37'] I think we continue sell off tomorrow and see 385.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:00:23'] like always, we made a bet and we got crush, nothing else to do. Even though 8.3 is still "okish", but most likely it's because core cpi tick up higher at 0.1 while consensus at 6.1 or lower. This is saying that next cpi is going to be at 8.5+, guess be ready to hit a new low soon. Market probably pricing in 100 point most likely.edit: Pretty hard to make any big trade these day and not get crush, let's just believe market will go lower and hopefully for rest of the month. (hope it's that easy)
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:32:13'] The shithouse burned down because the literal ENTIRE bull thesis was...  "Ok....  The highest inflation in half a century and it dropped like a few tenths of a percent last month, that's awesome!!!!.  It's topped out, over, the FED will throw in the towel and stonks only go up.  Plus, that news guy mentioned a new bull market".  That was it.  Literally. the. entire. bull. thesis.  Inflation IS NOT a linear thing.  The bear case is 50x stronger than the bull case, but people get so caught in news, fever, mania, pumpy bullshit they lose sight.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:43:32'] Seems like day trading is your forte man!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:47:56'] Thanks man, I have read your post this time and sorry for your lost and i apologize if i was being a di$k. I suspect that this week is basically going to be nothing but bloodbath because there is literally nothing to be bullish about. No one expect oil prices to be lower than what it is rn and still inflation is at 8.3% which is really really large if you account for the very low oil prices. Adding that what the fed cares about is the Core and core didn't peaked at all, and therefore, it is very highly that the fed is gonna announce 100 bp which could also be for the next time i think in November. An important note as well, is that Jpow himself said these times are gonna be hard on Americans, basically "hey guys your fucked". I do believe strongly that this time the situation is worse than that in June when SPY tanked to 360 in 4 days. I'm planning to go all in on puts and especially on the 21 st that would be ana amazing day to buy 0DTE puts, I think we could easily reach to 360s, but I would love to hear your opinion (not financial advice of course). If this works I'll recover all my loses and stop trading for good.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 15:59:28'] ta seems negativemagic 8 ball got the dump and also thinks a little more to go (\~-1%)one of the best days ever for me
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 13:51:48'] Looking forward to your video
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:22:53'] Held onto my 9/16 puts that were -90% waiting for this day, thank God I did. I sold them early on today for a small loss still. Like you I need to focus on day trades more. I was completely right in my conviction we would go down on CPI but due to those huge green days I still lost money. Sucks being right and still losing. Lesson learned.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:31:24'] tbh even as someone who used conformers bias and calculated the CPI miss I still knew the core will matter a lot and they had a high target on it at 6.1 so it was tough to predict it actually going down and tbh it would technically be possible but id rather just flip a coin and call it a day. I think the smartest play after seeing the 6+ Vix might’ve been straddles or 2% OTM spreads (condor). But it’s a hit and miss with events. End of day goes down to personal bias. A coin flip dare I say.  You’ve had a great track record on prior CPI trading and this one was just nasty, an outlier dare I say. I guess the only solid and reliable indicator to sell short would have been Cramer pumping the fuck out of it yesterday. Best thing to do on days like today is take advantage of the volatility to day trade
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 07:09:33'] What's up bro?What's our targets for the day?Wondering where we might go if we break past 394.I got a call I need to dump and trade for a put.Lol

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:25:52'] The SPX calls fuckin skunked me hardcore today.  Completely obliterated at 8:30, haha.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:54:09'] I guess Thu's job and retail numbers will be the last chance to pump before fomc, if not count the consumer sentiment on Fri. It is terrifying that 1% rate hike is on the table now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:59:45'] Well I was right (not bragging) but also sold at open so I feel as though I lost all the same…. Thought there was going to be a small bounce to partial fill and a resumption. Lost a lot of potential on that one. That was tough watching my position more than double after I sold it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 15:45:28'] The real surprise seems not headline cpi at 8.3 but core MOM is at .6% and 6.3%. That clearly tells what fed did or forecasted is not working!!  Headline inflation is controlled by Pump-out SPR which is lowest in reserves since 1980 - 1 million BPD a day accounting to 5% use of US consumption daily leading to ~40 cents decrease per gallon for consumers. That did not impact food which is confirmed today.When this pumping ends in October + Winter, We might see more real numbers.I got bull trapped yesterday and sold my puts :( Market win!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 15:58:17'] I am holding three $411 calls exp. 9/16 with an average cost of $352. These calls are already down 97% (so basically worthless). Are we expecting a bounce back or sell off tomorrow and Thursday? At the current prices I could add more of the same contracts for $17 each. My thinking is that for $170 I could buy 10 more and average down to $40/contract. That way if there was a small recovery, I would actually recoup more than with the 352 avg. I realize this is probably textbook chasing, but risking less than $200 to soften the impact doesn't sound too terrible...
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 16:00:06'] I, like you, tried to swing some puts on a bear share ETF ate shit hard on that on open, however,  i turned around and bought some S@P puts and got back all my losses by days end...    net 0 for me today, hoping i can get back on the horse tomorrow and get some daily gains, i agree with you,  day trading better than swing trading
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 16:15:55'] Slowly moved into a 10/21 400p position last week. Bought some a little early but kept DCAing going into CPI. Based mostly off the fact that I thought core CPI was going to be worse than expected. Also was watching the Cleveland fed nowcast data knowing that they were mostly correct over the last year and seeing a lot of projections of 7.9% to 8.1% being thrown out while the Cleveland nowcast was projecting 8.2% cpi and pretty bad poor core cpi. Overall my gains were around 100% because I did move in a little too early and bought some nearer dated calls to hedge yesterday. Lost about 80% of my call hedge due to not being able to close out at open (damn job). Closed my 400p position today to see how everything settles the rest of this week. Might sideline until fed meeting. Probably going to chop between 390 and 400 for a bit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 16:18:52'] I've been reading your posts for about a month now and I've made a decent bit of money following your lead on some plays and more importantly, learned a lot about how to play the market. And I really thank you for that. Because I had opened puts before I read you did and almost took your advice when you talked about selling when we hit 405 last week. But I didn't, and I want to credit you for helping me learn enough to be confident in making my own plays, even though you ended up on the other side of it. Truly, man. You are one of the best people in this sub.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 16:28:46'] I am starting to believe the jpm collar is the parameters we get to trade the market based on. That 4005 call has fallen from 32500 to 5320 in the last month. I was thinking they would at least close some of them today during the dip but nope not one call was bought back and closed. I wonder if those puts go itm at 3580. It's not farfetched 9% drop in 16 days when we fell 4.32 in one day. A few smart traders actually sold the 9/13 4005 call at the top yesterday.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 18:00:36'] Thanks for the post. I did pretty well today. Up only 10% on the puts I bought last week, but up 50% on the ones I bought this morning at open. Would have opened a larger position, but the morning bounce didn't bounce quite as high as I wanted it to.My puts are long dated, but I'm thinking I might sell if and when we touch 388, or at least size down for the possible relief rally. Hopefully that's tomorrow.My gut tells me this large of a move down is because \*finally\* the market understands how screwed we are, but I felt that way after the Jackson Hole meeting too.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 22:20:34'] Feel your pain on the loss. After i took a 4k loss in a day from the last jobs report number week I was conservative with a cpi play. Went with just a 405p and 419c strangle. Made some profit in the morning selling the 405 and decided to pick up 395p and 390p for Friday and Monday. Hopefully more downside to come
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 00:48:47'] yesterday was a circus of a day... no chance to catch huge moves that are this instant... i pre-readied some shorts earlier in the day, expecting some decline before the CPI drop which didn't happen... so i let them go with -5% and then the titanic sank... they would be up 110% EoDi managed to squeeze some more shorts but i left the day early not knowing if it was the bottom or not, hard to tell after a 3% move ... and it almost doubled later :)
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 00:54:37'] Historically after a big drop like this, there is a slightly higher chance of some recovery the next day due to overcorrection. I don't like puts, so near market close I purchased 1 call at $396 and I believe SPY will hit 399.59 today briefly, then Thursday it will go back down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-14 06:05:46'] I really appreciate the information you provide every day.  Actually everything you mentioned made sense.  I opened a call position first thing on Monday with the intention of leaving it until Tuesday.  However, around 3pm I started to have doubts after seeing VIX was up almost 1%.Then I checked the put/call ratio relative to SPY and the market in general, and realized that the sentiment was bullish.  From there I decided to sell and opened 2 puts. In the end you realize that more than numbers the stock market is a game of psychology.  In the same way, I agree with you that day trading is better than swing.  Again, thanks for your great work.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 14:18:57'] TA meaningless on days like this, or most days in general just admit you’re gambling by drawing lines from the past.  Hope you win it back but the more and l more I read the TA and see your outcomes it makes me realize it’s all just gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 19:04:29'] Up and down cycles are inevitable, just as Issac Newton once said, "What goes up must come down". Now, I don't mean that stocks are like gravity where it'll plummet back down to earth or to the core. But, stocks will inevitably come down, because people will want to pocket profits and reallocate assets as wise investors should (definitely doesn't extend to many of us here). That being said, for Aapl here's a list of bearish news I could list right now:* **Recession fears:** EU nations (ie: Germany) and some other wealthier nation(s) are entering a technical recession (New Zealand). Thereby, demand for discretionary goods (iphones/macs/ipads) traditionally will go down. As lending/credit will inevitably tighten, government bailouts or supports can only go so far before they can't lend any further (Not sure about this argument tho...)* **Sales Decline:** Certain segment of Apple products have been on the decline for the past few quarters, showing potential slowdown and worsening sales overall in the future* **Inflation**, while people are pointing out that inflation is declining people have to remember, we are talking about 4% inflation rate on top of a 8%+ inflation rate last year during the month of May alone. Wages have not caught up with it, and this discrepancy seems to be only widening. Yes, were not having a wage death spiral like the 70's, but we're also seeing a bigger gap in wealth. People nowadays are now more selective in their spending, giving a feedback loop to potential increase of recession. As spending slows so will profits and revenues decline for companies across all discretionary markets (Apple falls into this).* **Innovation**, Apple honestly, haven't really brought out any revolutionary products nor any new product(s) that can shake the whole market. Yes, they recently brought out that vision pro thing. But, at $3,500 how many people could really afford it just to "try it out"? Furthermore, we've seen how META, MSFT, Google all have given their shot at this eyewear market. Realistically none of them have had much success, yes maybe Apple could actually change it. But, unlikely just cause of the rich history of failures with this attempt of a product. I remember back in the 2000's seeing a teacher showing us similar 1990's version of these visual digital eyewear that was to simulate "a new world". Doesn't work well and haven't even after 3 decades... It'll probably take 3-4 generations before it could take off, which means cash burn. Remember Meta was confident they could pull it off, but now they're clawing back on their spending on Metaverse, that's one of the main driver in why META rebounded.* **Shareholders**, one of the least thought rationale why stocks decline. When a company such as Apple who have one of the largest or if not is the largest company in the world, shareholders will demand more and more out of it. This leads Aapl to one day face the same dilemma that oil companies now face. Oil companies in order to retain investors, have to return 50%+ on average of their gains back to their investors in the form of stock buybacks/dividends. While, there are a lot of reasons that differentiate between Aapl & oil companies in terms of industry demands (oil is a capital intensive market). It also acts as a good reminder that some of these oil titans of the 50-80's ended up having to return more and more over time to their shareholders in order to retain investors capital. These dividends/stock buybacks were things that Steven Jobs didn't really like overall, because he thought capital could be better/efficiently used by the company themselves. But, now Apple has gone down this road and gave out dividends and have increased their stock buybacks. When shareholders gets used to this, they won't take it kindly if Apple suddenly decreases it when it runs into a recession etc. So stock prices will come down significantly once Apple starts or slowdown stock repurchases/dividends.   * Look at Disney for example, yes Disney too have a lot of other reasons that Apple doesn't share commonality of why their stock prices declined from the heights of the pandemic. But, one of the things I see common when reading articles and opinions by investors is the lack of dividends or stock repurchases. Hedge funds/fund managers who want safe and stable returns looks to purchase these cash cow companies because they give a good or relatively fair return in the form of dividends/stock buy backs. Once, Disney went down this road of no longer giving dividends. They started to waver after the height of the pandemic and with more and more disappointing earnings report compounding it. Shareholders patience have only so much before they decide to drop the stock, that once gave dividends or stock buy backs. It's the fallacy of *"once given, it's hard to go back"*.Overall, these are my rationale why Apple could come down in the future, now these are just my opinions and shouldn't be used for any financial decisions. Also these are just the cons, I haven't listed any pros or any reasons why Apple could keep going up. There's both sides of the coins and honestly **Apple is a strong company**. I don't expect it to suddenly drop 20% in the span of a month. If that were to happen it'd have to be a recession on the scale of the GFC of 2008 or the great depression. But, just keep your toes on point and be mindful when making an investment/purchase. Do research and DD and hopefully it works out in the end.**TLDR:** Why I think a decline in Apple stock prices is cause of the following: Overbought, recession fears, inflation, sales decline in certain segments of apple products, lack of innovations that can be used/afforded by a lot of consumers, and shareholders demand. Overall, Apple is a strong company, but must be wary of this overly positive market when there's a lot of downside risk to it.

First, Apple is a very innovative company and consistently releases new products that consumers love. This keeps people interested in the brand and drives up sales. Additionally, Apple has a strong financial position with lots of cash on hand to invest in new initiatives or weather any storms that come its way. Finally, consumer confidence in the company remains high despite some recent controversies, meaning people are still willing to buy its products.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-08 18:36:29'] Yeah I’m seeing that black support line for SPY more clearly today, good catch. I can see that 390 top form on change optimism tomorrow. Cpi might be heavily cooked which worries me a bit on the 312 outlook by December 12 but the fed has said multiple times that they will not pivot. A 5% red day on Spy is possible on CPI and wouldn’t be out of the ordinary even if we get 8.2(a match from last month) because people are hoping it has came down(which it hasn’t and people love being wrong). Thinking a strangle/straddle would be the best play as if we do get extra cooked numbers we will probably hit 410 and gap fill before coming back down again.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 19:07:26'] I'd like to express appreciation for the time and effort you put into this so that we could consider alternative view points. Thoughtfully done.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 20:17:09'] Although I don’t disagree with your sentiment, I’d be concerned about the upcoming bear market rally. Your Apple position is probably fine because it’s further out, but your Tesla position might get clobbered.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 22:11:33'] I guess you missed the news that the cybertruck can also be used as a boat for a short time. There are no true players in the electric truck/boat market and the total addressable market is huge when you factor in the rising sea levels. Just look at Florida this week. TSLA is gonna float all the way back to the moon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 19:52:01'] I can see Tesla getting fucked, you would have to have some incredible growth to make their market cap reasonable.Apple though? Ehhh... harder to see it. They basically print money and perform well in many different areas. YTD they're down ~20% so it's not like they've come out unscathed or anything. They're not as down bad as other companies because their financials are very strong, which cannot be said for much of the garbage that has taken huge hits.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 20:14:20'] Firstly, the target audience for new iPhones is generally users who got their last phone 2-5 years ago.Secondly, betting against TSLA? Highly regarded. Good luck to you ✌️
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 21:28:02'] Best of luck to you, I’m part of the Elon cult but I’m still heavily considering a Tesla put position, it’s still got so much meat on the bone
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 21:28:40'] Also, just to add some detail before I call it a night. Fun fact, when apple has these kinds of downturns it usually loses 40-50% peak to trough. That's why my strike is 100$. I expect it to settle at 90 at the very lowest. Could be higher, but anything 90ish is done.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 23:24:25'] Great write up! Very cool and informative. I've been debating for weeks now if I should open a short position on apple. I still think it's not too late because the shoe to drop is going to be their earnings call, and the news that they're reducing their production is just the tip of the iceberg.Tesla on the other hand, I'm more unsure. On one hand, the muskrat has claimed that they have a multi year backlog and just can't produce those cars fast enough. On another, there are lingering quality issues, China weakness, supply chain issues, and the car is expensive as fuck, in a context where people are trying to save every dime.One catalyst I can see for tesla going down is the investors smell that their pre-orders start to get canceled. They will realize the growth is not their, leading to a big pull-out.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 20:18:22'] Only need that needs to be said about tesla is that FSD was the main justification for its insane valuation and it is vaporware. Gl with china btw.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 23:36:18'] Enjoyed the read and I agree. I'm optimistic that bears will feast well on TSLA as the demand dries up from the inflationary pressures. It's important to remember they have built factories for demand from an easy money decade. What if we have a decade of higher interest rates and the implications of a tighter wallet for consumers?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 11:07:38'] Great write up, lots of interesting points. But you must be aware that luxury goods tend to do much better than non luxury goods during recessions? Tesla also has an extreme advantage in pricing, if they need to they can create and or kill demand very quickly through their pricing. Thanks to their well above average margins they can create demand if needed, which already should decrease less than the average automaker. Regardless, I agree the stock is currently overpriced and should come down a bit more.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-30 03:29:57'] OP, thanks for the write up and being civil in your responses. I agree with a lot of your reasoning but with Tesla it seems you're letting emotion cloud your judgement. You admit yourself you personally hate the company and Musk and are using that to empower your short thesis. Your puts are green, that's great, basically puts on anything the past couple of months are up big time though.Musk does not draw a salary he only gets paid in Tesla stock. Therefore, he's highly motivated to stop it from falling too far and to prop it up when need be. Tesla's volatility makes it seem OK to short any rips upward but take your profits quickly or else face losing all your gains and then end up impotently hating Musk even more.

As I am writing this SPY is down about -0.9%. \n\nWe were able today to push pretty green and we broke through the last resistance of the bear channel level from the August sell off. That is pretty bullish. With this earnings miss we could look for a healthy pull back to reconfirm support after a pretty large 3 day green move up. Or this could end up being the next peak of the bear market rally and we start our descent downward to the 350s/ 360s. For me until we break that red bull channel support I will remain bullish.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-25 18:27:28'] Overall, I don’t see earning going well this week across the board.  Personally I’m going out on a cliff here and saying Apple miss this week.  If that happens we definitely retest 360 on spy really soon.  Apple has been almost invincible during these market slumps these past few years and I think it’s time is coming.  But who knows this market is crazy lol  Great TA!

I have assumed that you meant getting in at a known support/resistance and holding until just before the next support/resistance level. Now I am not so sure.Also, does tradingview automatically add in the support and resistance lines, or do you have to do them yourself? Is there an equivalent in TOS?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 17:06:51'] The UVXY been held at bay pretty well today. Only 2% up. If CNBC is shilling this as the worst week then this week is def near bottom if not bottom. I can see this week being red. Next being a wick down and a semi flat close then green the week after on CPI. There’s gonna be a criminally large short squeeze prior to next FOMC and elections imo. breaking the major lower low sets a perfect trap for the perma bears and even the bulls. Everyone and their mother is now short. The MM won’t let them profit. Premium being so high is a perfect proof. Can see some tech bouncing as hard as 30%, 10-20% on qqq’s in 2-3 weeks time. Catching the upcoming pivot will be extremely rewarding. But overall short/medium term is weak imo
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 16:23:35'] Was waiting to see if we blew past 370. Missed my chance for puts. Then ended up trying to time the bounce @ low 360s and barely made out green 😅

I’ve been holding QQQ $250 puts for march 2023 since may and tomorrow I have strangles leaning slightly to the bullish side. A part of me thinks that the spy will try and retest the 200 weekly EMA which is my sell trigger.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-27 17:57:44'] Does anyone here use Robinhood? I am having issues with day trading. I think I need to switch over to a cash account because as it stands now, if I make 3 trades I am done for the week. Also, is there any way to put different order types in for selling your contracts? Right now I have market and stop limit as an option. No trailing stop options. It would also be nice to be able to put in an order that allows me to set top and bottom sell conditions at the same time. Basically, I would like to be able to say sell when it reaches +15% or -30% at the same time. As it is now, I can only put in an order to sell at a certain number, but not both as the first order ties up the contract.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 16:59:17'] I notice last few posts VIX breaking down was subtly disregarded. That seems like an important element for a rally to unwind costly puts too.https://twitter.com/datatrekmb/status/1585279604612284416?s=46&t=CpebR__AJPEhZiHtqG21qQ
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 16:09:40'] Solid trading! Thanks as always for the in depth analysis!I followed your weekly TA from last Friday almost exactly - won 87.5% for +11% (had two winners turn around on me and closed +1%, damn!). My biggest loss -14.5%, biggest win +34.3%. Holding a 11/2 $395c as a weekend lotto that I opened around 2pm, which I’m glad to hear we’re on the same page about. Best of luck next week!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-29 06:54:53'] even the pattern overlaps with the prior July FOMC pump. i think only difference is the 2008 comparison chart. market is all too volatile rn to Vix to be as low as it is. Friday pump in apple imo. Was likley because blackout period ended and billions poured in squeezing shorts.

I paper trade your alerts and keep track of your plays but Tesla put never reached that much of a profit (if any). Unless you’re telling me you bought at the  low 10:30 am and decided to alert 30 mins later. You pride yourself in transparency so maybe it’s better if you can give us a screenshot of daily p/l from tos. You do that for plays with massive gains so why not do it for overall? Appreciate your great analysis tho. I hope you don’t take offense to my picky behavior
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 16:11:05'] Feel that AAPL’s earnings won’t be enough to give the market the juice it needs to keep this rally going. Almost all of big tech besides them got absolutely hammered so I think QQQ will see some lower lows in the next few weeks, also won’t help if JPow comes out and tells everyone no pivot in sight for the millionth time this year to kill that narrative again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-27 16:23:21'] How does apple actually being up after hours change your sentiment? I went cash at close and tbh I might call it a week and wait for Monday. Tomorrow seems like one of those days that could start either real red or very slightly green and literally go up down or sideways with no real direction. While earnings haven’t been great, I kinda feel like q3’20 again when traders mentally divorced earnings from reality and just kinda traded the way they wanted to. Fed signals seem to me the only thing that move this market with conviction.

Balls into calls!!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 21:48:57'] Hey thanks for the effort and the YT video. I tend to agree with you that either the bottom is in, or we do have one more flush to 350. After that I think we rally. I just bought 10x 380c SPY 11/18 @ 7.2 today. Something will likely lead the next push, whether that's either of the next 2 inflation prints or the election in Nov. Lets see, either way is good, if we go to 350 I'll do one more round.

So what does this mean? Well the last times this happened I coined it the phantom range and everytime it has happened the price of SPY has hit that level either intraday or the next day. This most likely is dark pool prints. \n\nToday was also extremely interesting when we look at the buy pressure, and TRIN. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcapwwxprur91.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4d2fdf1d213adb71e77526596e752f1dae5b577c\n\nLeft side is todays market data which shows that we had a legit buy pressure'

Wish i wouldve played SPY instead. Will probably gap down tomorrow morning to spite me but i didnt want to hold 3 dte with $110 theta overnight. I took your advice and switched to cash account. Much easier to cut losses now. I have a feeling we could be flat for a while, like theres no reason to keep going up but i dont see the reason to sell off either.

Also helped me scalp some puts last week and have a nice TQQQ flip holding over last night. Hopefully my move into SQQQ goes similarly in the next 2-3 days…

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-04 14:22:50'] If we drop, I think we make those lower lows and reverse green on CPI. The green CPI print will allow media to shill “yes Powell will ease up on us” ahead of the election. It would be crazy cuz the downside PT is ~9% away. That’s a FUCKLOAD of a drop. But if we do run green till CPI then it’ll be a coin toss imo. I did my DD and wrote it for anyone to read but next CPI print will be bullish AF and giga cold, could be used as a major catalyst even if core CPI is high again (unless we green into it then it’ll be a coin toss)These are dicy ass times though no cap

We just might pump crazy into it and “price in” the beat only to sell off. Who knows though. Markets not liquid and it’s easy to pump n dump. I’m concerned with today mid day drop. Had significant volume and came outta nowhere imo.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-08 09:52:51'] I think we go down irrespective of the cpi unless there is a really big cpi beat. Its just that with a minor CPI beat we go down slower than otherwise.  Also the bank earnings start rolling in next week and I donot think they will look pretty.I also think we see Apple flirting around 120 after earnings, which is where i will be buying.what a great week of trading for you..congrats!

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-09 03:17:31'] Monday market tanks again too much negativity In the news in the last 24 hours we’ve had musk negative press about his comment on his trans daughter, PayPal negative news on misinformation fines, meta just notified users of 1 million accounts of breach of passwords, AMD negative NVDA negative CS news still talking about liquidating.

POST: ['2022-11-10 15:39:42'] POST TITLE: b'11-10-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis'
POST_TEXT: b'Well today just made history in the markets While my analysis and prediction was VERY wrong for the CPI reading my play was VERY right and VERY profitable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/18090mk0m7z91.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d659ad80676cded28ebf5823b72327918eca38e9\n\nA beat on CPI actually makes trading SPY for the next month even harder then a miss. Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI came down we have to deal with yet again the fed pivot/ slowing news media cycles hitting the tapes. \n\nOverall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me0yb'
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 16:06:14'] In hindsight, today was a continual movement up but I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. Not quite sure how to play tomorrow. The market couldn't be any more fragile. The slightest good news sends it soaring.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 16:17:48'] I loaded on AAPL calls and going to sell them tomorrow. I think market will continue to rally tomorrow up to mid day but I don't have balls to keep'em calls after that.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 18:28:07'] Very wild day for sure. A CPI beat was the last thing I expected today so I only played puts unfortunately. You’re spot on, this is a really tough spot to be in. I want to be bullish but I think we are extremely overvalued right now. Earnings are still shit and money is still expensive. I also had a coworker point out that the DOW is almost back to ATH and after I checked I realized that he was right. Absolutely crazy
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 16:11:08'] Congrats on that great strangle play. I think today was probably the worst rally I have seen and I am afraid we havent seen the end of it, I think we test 400 tomorrow and  410 early next week before a big red day. End of the year is going to be very tricky for trading.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 17:56:04'] Hello again, I'm glad I exited my SPY puts yesterday with a nice profit even if I gave it back trying to call the reversal today lol. By the looks of it spy shot up a bit too much I would have thought we go to 380 and then dump but hey YoY is still down even if MoM is still higher. &#x200B;Wondering if you also saw the rising wedge on SPY today and in futes it looks to be forming a triple top. Looks like a complete reverse of yesterday might happen tomorrow where we gap down to 385-282. I doubt we go much higher than 395(heavy resistance)&#x200B;nice job on the strangle as well <3.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 16:07:39'] Thanks for the great analysis man! The upside market really threw me off today.. I really wanted it to go down or stay at yesterday’s lows at least so I can buy some dips for my portfolio. I think I missed my chance of buying dips.. Hoping for a negative CPI and another 75bps in December with the end of year market sell off to get my hands on some dips. Thanks again for the great analysis
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 18:49:28'] I fully expect 2% + in either direction tomorrow. Leaning bullish after today but I feel there could be profit taking and a gamma squeeze the opposite direction especially if it opens down. Any decent world news can shake this market right now. Very fragile
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 20:13:38'] For once in my life I played today’s rally perfectly. I had calls yesterday sold 50% at open, waited patiently at open at around 15min for that dip, bought next week $400 calls at $118 and sold half my midday, then added more at $225 and sold mostly all at $300 end of day. God I love these nice easy bullish trend days. I realize my strongest and easiest for me is trend trading, but like you mentioned it’s really hard to trust these trend days when at any moment the rug can get pull! Congrats on your wins!
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 21:40:14'] Wow amazing write up.. thanks for the time you put into this. I wish more people who post their loss porn of life savings “I’m new to options am I doing it right” would just take a few minutes to look over information like this.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-10 19:38:22'] Great analysis! I’m all puts for tomorrow. Caught some of the green today but not as much as I’d like. I think we are in the precipice of going down, down, down.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-06 15:22:04'] I am actually fairly bullish today, seeing that it didn't break 61.8% (\~3900) of the retracement level, bears have tried this 3 days already, and bull still managed to pull it up and close above it (Today was extremely close though), obviously bears still winning on everything. CPI week is generally pretty bad, I would go in with a put just like everyone else, the risks and rewards are just better. Really trying to be extremely patient these day and have small position, it's ok to miss on some gains.

Impressively META and TSLA actually come in at the least shortable stock right now.\n\nI think one thing thats really mind boggling to me is the fact that APPLE is only 6% from its ATH, and the fact that AMD has a PE ratio of 394.94!!!! Also Amazon forwar'

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 16:59:08'] NVDA is the best example of the "market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent".It will come down, but the question is when. I got burnt twice on trying to short NVDA, and will not touch it again until we have a clear downtrend (like TSLA did last fall).

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 15:29:28'] The more and more I see how price action is behaving the past couple weeks, the more and more I am convinced that MMs are using every trick in their bag to prevent from having to pay out all the puts in the market and it feels like they are running out of tricks. Things feel like they are boiling over, day after day, week after week. After monthly OPEX expires this Friday, I bet we see a huge move in the markets starting next week and I’m betting it’s to the downside. Thanks for the daily write ups. I look forward to them everyday 👍🏼
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 18:59:53'] Too early for the big short 2.5, aren’t tech typically the last to fall? Wait for 4-5 more months, 425+ SPY, rate cuts and the talk of soft landing successful, thats when you know the rug will be pulled and we come crashing down into the next recession.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 15:26:32'] You know, I was very bullish on the small caps today. I knew a strong day on the IWM was on play. So I should have been looking for strong stocks that held up the spy drop. However, I selected the wrong stock, $UBER instead of the one actually ripping on the day $AI. This loss was on me for not paying attention to the daily chart.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 15:02:24'] Your daily DD and summary is as good and accurate as any I ever see, even though with the volatility lately we often break beyond the support and resistance lines. Might be helpful to indicate whether strong or weak resistance. I can parse it fine, but others may not see things as easily.I made almost $47k this week just playing the levels, but I WATCH all day, every day. A lot of the guys around here don't have that luxury.Thanks for your efforts, OP. I hope our fellow retreads have a lot of success, and profits.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-05 09:17:15'] the thing with apple is that they announced lay offs Thursday AH. I think a close under 136 for apple on a daily would be the last confirmation for the final collapse. Off my DD and TA. We should run up next week and be rather green into CPI. Illl be trading levels rather than the events. but I hope we can see Vix around 20 cuz that’s where Vix bottom would be. we should see the black swan Monday the 14th or 21st as the latest. But judging from how the democrats are pulling all sorts of strings to keep the market afloat I would say they are the reason the swan wasn’t triggered this week. And I’ve done enough DD and conformed bias that I think the US gov has interfered to hold the swan at bay till post mid terms. Im extrodinalry certain however that by 21st we will see the black swans feathers as it lands ontop of our chartsEdit: Vix 21/22 for that Vix gap fill. Vix is one of those things that ALWAYS fill their gaps with a wick but that gap wasn’t filled and it’s on a weekly candle. Very odd. The all seeing algos left it there as a magnet that they can use in the future for price suppression. The algos have been using the options market to drive down the VIX and that right there is their target. The gap fill to 21.24

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-06 17:34:53'] I don’t have a good feeling either way about the CPI print next week. I think odds are that it’ll be interpreted as bad news unless it comes in really low. I do suspect that Octobers numbers are going to jump up again. The obvious reason is that gas prices are going up but the not so obvious reason is that used car prices are going to jump because of the hurricane down in Florida. I would also suspect that building materials will also start to jump.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-06 19:15:22'] I usually don’t post here, but today was a pretty weird trading day in that in the first 10 mins of the morning we had an incredibly bullish flag that showed plenty of indicators (upwards VWAP, red to green, strong previous close) that screamed that we were going to go on a run, just for the market to fake back down onto an overall downward trend for the day. Usually only see nonsensical moves when we’re gearing for a strong move down.Short term though looks like there’s too much bearish sentiment to sell off. I’m guessing we consolidate for another fakeout on CPI data before really drilling down.

An iPhone still works without the Twitter app. Twitter, the company, has far less market share if people need to manually navigate to the web app instead of using the native app. Elon can fuck all the way off into the sun in one of his rockets.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 18:23:02'] I don’t know if Twitter has much of an impact on Apple. People buying Apple products do it for other reasons, besides the fact that if someone absolutely wants to use Twitter, they can log in from a browser.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 19:40:13'] iPhone shortage in China is what might cause Apple to sink, not so much elon. Well atleast we know where Apple stands with free speech whether it’s on Twitter or in China.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 00:36:15'] Nope,   Apple will be up and down with the economy and will be affected by short term supply issues but they are as solid as they come.  Super strong brand that makes quality gear.  Not sure what I would describe Twitter as?   It wouldn't be very complimentary.

POST_TEXT: b'The bulls are back in control or are they? \n\nLets take a look at a few things before we get into the charts and the technical. \n\nIf you follow me you know that I came into this week bearish and I was positioned with some 390p 14dte puts expecting a touch of 370-380. Now the question is why was a bearish? \n\nWell going into this week we had the attempted breakout at 430 that led to a massive sell off that led to 3 red weeks with us finally turning in a green week on SPY this week. On a technical standpoint puts made sense and calls would have been against the trend in addition we had the CPI looming. Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI. With literally every single fed member, JPOW himself and heck even Biden saying inflation has not peaked with the massive sell off, the suspiciously long time we went with no CPI forecast/ consensus one would assume it was because they were going to predict inflation >8.5% (higher then previou'
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 16:52:13'] Tbh man, your read outs are about the only reason I'm still on reddit. Its great to hear confirmations/informative counter points to my ideas during the day. I solely trade tesla, but it more often than not follows the market. Love all the research, please keep it up
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 16:40:40'] You could be right about the short term bullish outlook, but I think there is a good chance of a sell off at the end of September as markets "digest" the continued rate hikes and the Fed's balance sheet unwinding.  I personally think Core CPI is not going to look great, and unless the war in Ukraine ends suddenly(which would annihilate my puts), energy prices will more than likely rise again in the medium term.Either way, I appreciate these posts!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 16:00:31'] Totally didn’t know you had a YouTube, gonna be checking that out.  Nice work
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 17:05:07'] I am worried about the market is buying the rumor and will sell the news, so my plan is to open straddle next Monday. (Not a financial advice)I agree that after CPI until FOMC we have the trend clear but also afraid about a sudden guidance revision before earnings like what Walmart did before. Overall, not a easy market to trade nowadays.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 17:39:34'] Got shaked out of my puts today shoulda sold Tuesday. The key resistance kills me everytime. The 2yr/10yr started popping off this afternoon. Is that an indication of impending sell-off? I'm a ratard. I'm waiting for dxy to pop. Could lead to downside.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 17:46:38'] What's up... me again.. 10 year up... oil up... dollar down.. this rally has priced in a cpi beat. If we miss by even .01, I think we drill until fomc. At some point, the market will come back to earth and start acting rationally. I would put money on the fact that we raise rates by at least .75. 50 basis points isn't even on the table in my opinion... but,.5 is the only way I see 430. Monday might still be green, we might even touch 410. But I'm expecting 8.1 or greater on cpi.I opened some 90+dte qqq puts today and some qqq put leaps today because I think we maybe touch 410/308-310 on Monday and then drop. If im wrong, I'll close them and money lost is minimal, if im right, I'll make good money.And personally, even if we come in at 8.1, I don't think the market is gonna be happy because that has been a lot of rate hikes and the results have been minimal. I also think if we come in to hot.. 8.5 or greater, I think the market will price in a 100bp hike which will tank it further.. Clearly, I am more bearish. The macroeconomic headwinds are ominous and I don't think we will get a soft landing.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 18:41:44'] Blew up my account this week doubling and tripling down on puts, feel like an idiot, broke every rule. If I didn't hold onto losers so long I'd be killing it. How long did it take you to get that discipline?
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 17:11:09'] As a bear, I know regular CPI will come lower but I’m betting on core to come in higher considering core did not drop last month. Granted core can simply be lagging regular cpi as many aspects of it are affected by oil prices. The real question would be how far it is lagging which I’ll try to look into as that would be pretty smart of me to do lol but I haven’t. I think there was a prior CPI sell off before due to core and it caught the market and average retailer by surprise due to confusion
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 18:03:49'] I still think this is a fake rally and will consider puts around 410 - 412. I will buy the near term bull case if CPI is less than 8.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 18:56:32'] I too ended my week green w/  a 0DTE SPY Call at opening, let it ride all day and got back some silly losses from this week.   I agree w/ you that we will probably consolidate monday until tues after a 'good' CPI , then i will load the boat on SPY calls again.    i honestly think we are gonna tractor beam up to 4300+ to make a higher high before we go lower again, the weekly chart is showing some higher lows and higher highs from our bottom back in july, i think we will continue that trend until poor earnings in oct. nov.  like you said.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 19:31:14'] The fed wants to see asset prices drop
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 20:45:30'] I actually started averaging into a 10/21 400p position on the SPY today. I'm seeing evidence of profit taking and repositioning of puts going into Oct/Nov. I also think the fed has clearly stated they are not ready to pivot. And finally, I think core inflation has definitely not peaked, oil will drag CPI down as a whole, but oil fluctuations are not the signal the fed is waiting for.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 18:05:49'] Great analysis as always! Thank you. I read each and every word you write!!
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 20:01:29'] Apple wasnt the only one that under perform vs spx this week. Other mega tech like google and msft also underperformed this week. So maybe people were buying them so much on the last run up, they are somewhat overvalue for now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 20:17:10'] Enjoying your posts.  Really appreciate your analysis.I kind of think though, that the way spy was on the same uninterrupted trend the last two days on no volume, this may be a bull trap.I’m confused, and I’m swinging both calls and puts for next week.  Hoping for a dip below 405, close the put, then ride my 410 call out.  Or vice Versa.I’ve also got a 390 9/30 put…may be hedging with a call depending on what happens next week…Also, curious as to your thoughts on how the Fed unloading its balance sheet fits in to market direction this month?

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-10 10:23:12'] Now that everyone is turning bullish again, can’t shake the feeling a rug pull is inevitable. Just like this week when everyone was so bearish, we had the face ripping rally. Keep in mind we are seeing a huge influx of puts, more than 2008. Yes, they could all be wrong, but I still think this is just a bear market rally, in preparation for a bigger fall.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 23:19:40'] You know you can’t beat machines (computer algorithms) consistently on a daily basis. At least that’s what I hear. Maybe the market goes up, but I’m just about certain Apple will see 120-130 again before or right after the upcoming earnings. It makes logical sense, and when earnings continue to decline, financial advisors with a “fiduciary” duty will be forced to sell.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 18:49:37'] It's interesting you mentioned the blue resistance on the SPY daily because on 1hour and 15min the resistance line is better drawn with candles from Aug 16 (peak) and Aug 18 - that actually put the Jackson Hole day SLIGHTLY below the resistance line (instead of being the second touch). Most importantly, these other time frames show we stopped JUST short of the resistance line at the end of today (Friday 9/9).  Maybe it's my bearish hopium, but I was surprised to see people saying we broke resistance when it seemed like we had stopped right on it. Might be worth looking at, but what do I know...
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 17:41:37'] Why do you think they are hiding CPI values compared to before? I was bullish all week and that Queen Shake broke my focus and I sold. What do you recommend on not jumping the gun when news breaks or there is a panic sell?

But in the mid to long term these figures have the ability to turn market sentiment, because with a company so large and premium they give the best estimate of the purchasing strength of the consumer right now. So watch for the indices, I expect the real reaction to be there.

I think consumer stocks like Coca Cola and Mc Donald’s would fair better as opposed to big tech but even as Netflix, Tesla, and Snap have reported beating earnings(however Tesla was down on revenue) I could see tech stocks beat earnings. The general selling that occurred was due to the 10yr yield going to 4.2. We saw the dollar rise midday as well. However this is probably the result of the shit flinging going on at England. We will hit 390 before we hit 330.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 19:29:17'] I think this bounce was a shit ton of buying triggered when SPY hit 3500. A lot of funds are pegging 3300-3500 as bottom. If we test 3500 again we will not hold. There are plenty of catalyst to get us there in the near future. I could be wrong for sure but until I see vix over 40 I am not convicted we have seen the bottom.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 15:03:08'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 14:38:23'] So I sold my car and I’m getting a nice chunk of change this weekend.  All in 30dte puts?
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 16:17:09'] i feel really dumb for not shorting the shit off the giant cliff, but the first dip and rise back to original level after 10:30 shook me and i was afraid to pick a side thinking it would immediately reverse (which ofc it didn't because i didn't pick a side, you're welcome everyone who made tons of money today :) )my only trade today was the slow slide before 10 am, took my few % and just beat myself all day for not pushing the trigger, well you win some you lose some
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 17:34:29'] Really like your analysis dude, combines news and technicals
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 14:35:22'] I wish I could read
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 17:18:03'] This shit's easy if you're not 100% in.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 19:52:29'] I’m definitely glad I put a stop loss on my 0DTE SPY call that I bought at open lol. I then switched to puts after we started dumping and was rewarded greatly. Although I didn’t take profits yet so hopefully I don’t get burned Monday. I think we’re going to drop a lot more since this whole rally was based off an assumed fed pivot. Now that that is out of the picture, you would think we would drop back to at least the 380’s
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 15:27:09'] good day, though i wish i held onto my puts longerlike ta, magic 8 ball is negative
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 15:31:22'] So much for those calls you talked about in yesterday's TA. Gap fill to 421 and might see 430 my ass. Hahaha!
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 23:06:42'] Betting on a gap down on Monday and hit 390ish then bounce up to try and fill the gap made on Monday. Leaning towards a 400 or lower open. Hopefully my theory plays out lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-27 06:39:41'] Friday was an over reaction, all those things he said should have been priced in already.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 14:53:36'] Wild wild wild day indeed. I definitely need to work on my patience and wait for actual confirmation. I noticed that I marry my positions because I “expect” the market to do something, as opposed to reacting to it. I’m staying away from swinging contracts as well, I had the correct bearish thesis kn the beginning of the week, just to get stopped out on yesterday’s rally and then the much anticipated sell off. Ugh frustrating week indeed,  but you’re right, this has been one of the hardest trading environments I have traded in ( started trading 2 yrs ago).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 15:35:35'] How does it feel to know that one guy can move the markets so much just repeating the same things over and over again?I had 3 short /ES futures overnight but closed too early after the fake recovery spike at the beginning of the speech. To top it, I opened a long position near the market close but the futures continued to tank big after hours. Terrible day!
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 16:05:49'] Dumb enough to got some puts near the close, expecting the market to give back what is priced in for a pivot around q2 gdp release, like @395 after or @382 before.![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 16:36:56'] After NVDA puts burned me yesterday (that I held and was lucky to close green) I held off on entering a spy 8/29 410p position at the bell last night. Would have been stellar.Oh well, gotta keep looking for the next one.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 14:41:57'] Held and averaged down my SQQQ position through that run up and it feels good seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with today
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 17:30:23'] In my opinion, market doesn't need a reason to sell off. Just like it had no reason to rally from July over 17% on nothing new. Back in March this year, the market rallied hard the first day of the ukraine war. And it continued to rally hard until one day it just stopped. Then it started to dump very hard based on nothing new.In 2018, Powell raised interest rates, and all of these actions were known before October, they had announced their plans and began the QT and rate hikes a year before. Yet, it took a whole year for the market to finally wake up and react. The market didn't immediately drop, it was not forward looking, it just started to drill gradually based on nothing new until Powell pivoted.And all the reasons exist for the market to sell off right now. The recession has not been priced in, EPS and bad earnings/forward guidance have not been priced in, effects of QT and interest rate hikes still yet to be felt. Housing market is in shambles. Notice how bonds didn't change today, but stocks did, because bond market already priced this stuff in, but stocks have not. All the more reason for us to drop as stock market finally wakes up and volume picks up as the big boys come back from vacation. If one doesn't go long on short positions here, one will not be able to go long on them at all, we will hit the bottom by the time and the opportunity will have passed. The top of the bear market rally has been confirmed, and this is the best place to enter them shorts fresh off the beginning of the descent of the next leg down to ride. Just my opinion, of course.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-27 06:46:29'] My 2000 spy puts I open right before the meeting  8/31 385p printed quiet nicely. I actually expected a more dramatic drop below 400 today. Since we held 405 I closed them out for. 300% gain. Was not going to let the profit slip away over the weekend. I do expect a face ripping Green Day Monday. But just in case I bought 300  1dte for Monday 385p to hedge my 20. 408c  for Wednesday. I expect a violent move one way or another

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 14:38:41'] Bro I had a bearish sentiment for today and was going to sell calls, but saw your post and decided to hold off for a bit incase I’m wrong 😑. More of a compliment as you have been providing great analysis. Keep up the great posts and really appreciate all the insight.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 15:20:45'] I would not be suprised to test 4220 spx next week but only thing im carrying into sunday is 1 short mes
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 16:49:59'] bruh I like your stuff but you literally say everyday that this is your wildest day
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 15:45:30'] I closed my outs yesterday for a 50% loss, didn’t open today cuz I was busy then saw the drill down. I knew holding weekend wouldn’t be smart so now I’m here with no positions and the contracts I sold yesterday are up 100-200%. I really hope we see a bounce back up that I’d short but judging by the after hours move and volume there’s still much to unload. Monday seems like it might end up being deep red unless the media decides to pump but those fucks have flipped bearish as far as I can tell and are creating FUD. Every little green candle on large volume was shorted the hell down. Overall frustrated and upset. I truly hope Monday isn’t a gap down. We broke the 50MA like hot knife through butter hence I smell a gap down on Monday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-26 17:59:45'] Do you think this high volume is whales saying "peace out" and getting into cash for a Significant drop?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 07:05:31'] Lmao...WSJ is trying to paint this guy in a good light? Fuk that. Total ponzi with the upper levels gutting and withdrawing funds even when there was an asset freeze in place.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-26 07:56:46'] The web headline for the same article is "Sam Bankman-Fried Said He Would Give Away Billions. Broken Promises Are All That’s Left." [https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-plans-to-save-the-world-went-down-in-flames-11669257574](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-plans-to-save-the-world-went-down-in-flames-11669257574)This isn't a case of the media covering for the guy. This article is only a couple days old. It's for people who already know the basics of the FTX story, and it covers an aspect they might not previously know: the $160 million in grants that FTX pledged to charities, a pledge they're reneging on. That's not a defense of FTX, it's another bad thing they did.Here are the final lines of the article:>Last week, Mr. Bankman-Fried exchanged messages with a writer at Vox, a news organization that Building A Stronger Future had also pledged to fund.   >  >“You were really good at talking about ethics,” she said.  >  >“I had to be,” Mr. Bankman-Fried responded. He went on to explain it as “this dumb game we woke westerners play where we say all the right shiboleths \[sic.\] and so everyone likes us.”

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 19:11:44'] That 521m in regulatory credits will go away soon as other auto OEMs ramp up EV production. That's the reason they don't need profits on EVs, because they get these credit tailwinds. This was stated by their CFO on a previous call.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 17:41:42'] I’ll tell you why you should buy Tesla.   The US Federal government thanks to the inflation reduction act will literally be raining federal tax credits (cash) to hedge funds, private equity, and other companies that invest into EV sustainability.  30 cents for every dollar spent on these initiatives will be given back to be exact in the form of a tax credit that can be sold.   Do you understand what this means and the amount of companies that will become the next EV pioneers to get back 30% for everything they spend?  These types of tax credits (cash back) will even have companies like Chevron scratching their heads thinking should we open another rig or take that money and become EV charging station manufacturers and be guaranteed to get 30% of the investment back.  What does this all mean?  It means the company selling EV cars and most established in EV (Tesla) will have most to gain as a result of all this investment from the tax credit hungry venture capitalist looking for a 30% guaranteed return from an investment.  There will be close to $500 billion worth of federal credits printed over the next 10 years.  It will not be abnormal for even small time people to be able to buy a federal credit on the resale market for 90 cents on the dollar from one of these venture capital offices that has a shit ton of them to sell.  If you owe 100k in federal liability in the years to come you will be able to buy your federal liability from a VC for 90k cash and save yourself 10k in liability to the federal government for buying your liability instead of paying it.  Large businesses will do this also to a huge scale.  Owe 10 million in liability hit up VC office that invested in EV initiatives and buy $10 million worth for $9 million cash.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 18:35:45'] I feel dumber for having read this.  You think a 30% tax credit on qualifying expenditures equals a 30% return ? Did you forget about the expenditures part of that equation ?  And even if these credits were tradeable. Wich I'm highly skeptical of that being true.  Why would any company sell a credit for less than its value vs using that credit of .30  to offset the expenses it incurred of 1.00.  This is an incentive for companies to spend toward electrification. It's not free money. It's not a gaurenteed return.  They won't be sold back and forth on the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 04:56:21'] They literally said years ago their goal is to offer the same or better equipped car at a lower price each year yet everyone keeps bringing up price cuts as a negative.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 08:54:03'] all those points dont mean much when you zoom out. Tesla is the only car manufacture making money on their EV. the rest of the OEMs are selling at a loss. Also once the rates go back down, its business as usual. Also they energy storage is just starting to takeoff, it will be huge.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:36:52'] I own a large percentage of my portfolio in tesla, and do agree I wouldn't buy any more with their revenue continuing going down but I don't think it makes sense to compare telsa margins to companies that are primarily software companies. Rivian has proved, that tesla has more of a moat than one would think since they lose more money per car then tesla ever has. Public perception has always trumped fundamental's with telsa  and for some reason the company and its CEO have become addicted to negative press.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 12:07:11'] Amount of data Tesla has about the driving behaviour can help them shape the future of driving. No other car company has data on driving behaviour. Can’t evaluate the value of those data

Maybe talked about the hot neighbor. Maybe talked about who was most at risk of defaulting on their credit cards and you guys thought it would be fun to gamble which one of you nerds would default first?Ive never considered that before either. Sounds fucking crazy right?Then why the hell are the most sophisticated of people on earth selling the risk of default to each other? I dunno. Could it possibly be that the government in some form or another is actually the one responsible for the payment of your stoned and drunk friends debt?.. who in fact was sensible enough to sell all risk to a friend he supposedly cares about.I have a hard time seeing why anyone who wasn't corrupt would do this...

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 14:45:27'] PPI news and HD and WMT earnings maybe caused a dump EOD. Brainard wasn't exactly dovish or hawkish in her interview today, but she did caution that CPI data that came out is not enough to stop raising rates. But, the fact that she reiterated that size of rates could be smaller was a welcomed sign by markets. Though, inflation expectation numbers today, and consumer confidence last Friday are headwinds for markets. So, if PPI is lower than expected that might be the catalyst to push us over that 400 wall. That would make it a second data point that is "confirming" that the fight against inflation is working.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 14:08:30'] Volume was low today, so I think a 0.75-1% pullback was healthy. Swinging calls

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-14 15:53:47'] I have been noticing how VIX always spikes up on Monday open for the past few weeks for no reason at all. Long dated volatility hasn’t increased on the day however looking at /VX futures.Looks to me that people are hedging for WMT earnings and PPI tomorrow which led to the drop at close, but the hedges are short dated puts so it doesn’t affect volatility in the long term

The biggest bullish moves today was confirming the daily 20ema as support, closing over the daily 8ema support and closing back inside the green channel. The next step for bulls is to take our 380 resistance that held us up end of day and close over the 50ema. With the black rising wedge still in tact you can see my next target for SPY is that 388.5 to 390 level which I believe we could see before Wednesday EOD. \n\nHowever, tomorrow we have to see SPY break through 380 which is where that red resistance line for the pre fomc/ fomc sell off inters'

Was able to get lucky and ride the wave nicely today. Powell increased the rate hike point by year end, market didn't prepare for that, so it reacted negatively at the end. I bet it will go lower tomorrow since 3850 didn't hold, neither did 3800. Again, pretty good chance we'll see June low again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:13:02'] Of course, he's one of the largest holder of $APPL for a reason:"Apple has been engaged in a massive stock buyback program, having bought back nearly $90 billion worth of its shares in fiscal 2022. Since the program began in fiscal 2013, Apple has spent more than $550 billion in stock buybacks, more than any other U.S. company."
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 02:11:14'] Why does “Illiterate” have three of the same letter in a row?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 22:12:28'] What’s the difference between forcing stock value up with buy backs over paying out a dividend you may ask? After all both are performed with money the company has earned and neither route is decidedly to the benefit of the worker.The difference is dividends are taxed, while capital gains have to be realized before they can be taxed, and as every long hold investor knows the longer you can go without paying tax the better.Now the question you need to ask yourself is if your yearly growth is enough for you to be on one side of the fence or the other.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:39:05'] When interest rates were at all time low, buying back stock with borrowed money was the thing to do. Now that rates are higher the only ones getting loans to buyback stock are desperate ones. If they are profitable and buying back stock its how they best see spending those profits with equipment and personnel being expensive right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 21:06:33'] It is not the buybacks people criticize. It is the laying off 10,000 people, fighting for gov't subsidies and tax breaks, and THEN buying back stocks with the saved money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 23:18:00'] Buybacks are one of the best things a company can do.   Google has been grifting investors for years by buying the stock back and then basically issuing the stock right back to the management as compensation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 20:00:30'] Plenty of legitimate reasons to criticize it. You can use that cash to make better investments into the business or you can give it back to shareholders with a dividend. Buy backs can also be a vehicle to pump up the stock since it signals to the market that the company thinks the stock it undervalued.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:59:08'] He is absolutely full of shit.  With executive compensation directly tied to stock price this is often used to manipulate stock prices more so than the company truly believing they are undervalued.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:13:47'] At a recruiting even some college kids asked James Gorman why Morgan Stanley just laid off 300 employees and announced an $8bn buyback lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 17:12:27'] If you work for a living, and have worked since the 80’s, this is one of the major components of why your wage has stagnated.A successful company pre-buyback SOP would spend windfall profit on things like 1)bonuses 2) salary bumps 3) pm’s/expansion/capital equipment.Some dickburger CEO said fuck you, look at how much my board and big shareholders love me as I literally pumped my own dick by buying my own piece of shit company instead of YA KNOW *wasting* it on the choobs responsible for making the profit happen in the first place.Now, most of wsb are fucking choobs working in a company that pull this chicanery and take it upon themselves to take their earnings and invest it. Thing is- once that profit is spent on buybacks IT IS GONE. It is paper. Let’s take this balance sheet of green ink and buy our own shar.. oops it’s gone. They can sell it sure, but are they going to *waste* it on workers again? Fuck no. Golden parachutes or get out of jail free card when their PE is so bearish it powerbottoms out.TL;DR about 99.9% of you should hate stock buybacks as you don’t have extra money to blow on your own self funded share buyback program/gambling addiction/ ability to afford your own home in your late 20’s, 30’s, 40’s. Look at real wage growth, look at share buyback programs- motherfucking DD is SPICY.Fuck you ancient boomer Buffet, suck my balls!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 15:08:12'] Hey all you illiterates
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:25:10'] when a company is rebuying back their own stocks it means they're undervalued. you should start shaking when they're selling their own stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:19:21'] he is right on the money about that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:29:31'] Well he's not wrong
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:32:15'] F that. When they don’t have any money to hire open positions or do promotions but they do billions of stock buyback that is being greedy a$$ rich @holes
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 22:59:32'] Just make it so half of stock buybacks go to employees
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 04:03:26'] This arsehole knows why people hate buybacks, it's an easier way for shareholders to raid the companies coffers and push up stock values. And if they stuck to the definition of 'handing back excess/ spare cash to shareholders' then it would be fine. But 99% of buybacks occur when a company also desperately needs to spend in some areas to remain long term viable, like maintenance, R&D, staff retention etc. It's not excess cash they don't need, it's fucking everything not nailed down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:00:26'] The people who are supposedly well versed in economics are running the world economy and I am staring down the barrel at my 4th "once in a lifetime" economic crisis.Every single promise that's been made in my lifetime about more "economic freedom" and less government intervention leading to prosperity for all was bullshit.Buffet is a clown.  I hope he survives long enough to be dragged out of his home by an angry crowd carrying torches and pitchforks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 22:21:47'] So he’s changed his tune again, 5y ago he said buybacks were a sign of a company running out of ideas and growth
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 20:52:32'] Stock buybacks are the best use of excess cash according to Buffet because it directly increases shareholder value, which is better than paying out a dividend. He’s right on accounting, tax law and share buy backs. Adopting his views would benefit society at large. It’s all an accounting song and dance that is wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 23:17:37'] Buybacks are virtually the same as dividends, and ultimately help to raise the value of a stock. Only difference is a buyback doesn’t lock a company into the commitment for consistent payouts signaled by dividends.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 22:30:06'] Economic illiterate, another word for communist
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 19:18:02'] Well I say Warren Buffet and his entire class are economic leeches, so woopie-freakin-doo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 21:55:26'] Need some help here. I come from a value investing background and stopped on this post as it mentioned Buffett. What do you overall think about his teachings on long-term value investing in this sub or personally? Are people here *actually* aware of his approach towards investing vs trading? Would really appreciate your thoughts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 02:51:24'] It’s true. Proof: everyone in this thread saying Buffet doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 04:15:04'] Tax dollars for stock holders so they can benefit from buybacks is a strategy!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:29:02'] He's got 128 billion in cash
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 21:59:44'] Buybacks are BS. If a corporation’s best use of cash is to buy their own stock because is “undervalued” it’s just decreasing the company intrinsic value therefore penalizing long term growth and shareholdersWho profits then? Executives.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 00:17:41'] Okay somebody provide me some information. When a company buys more than half its own stock back is that technically it becoming the largest shareholder and thus cannot be bought out by a competing company? Or is that just the company returning to private because it no longer mainly relies on public debt? I genuinely don't know how this relates to buybacks

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 06:35:15'] Was going to say stock buybacks need to be taxed as income--and they do, but this is wallstreetbets.  They're definitely not something that needs to exist on a social level.  From a money-making/trading standpoint, they shouldn't exist either.  How do they work with long shorts?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 07:09:57'] Ouch, Chamath Palihapitiya…
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 07:11:16'] From a very fundamental market standpoint buybacks are a very reasonable activity.  Here is your 5th grade education if you happen to be in a double digit iq career like day trader or congress.1. Companies without enough $ to grow sell stocks to get $.2. If a company needs more money later on the only options they have are:A. Print more stocks which makes all stocks less valuableB. Buy back stocks when you believe they are undervalued (e.g. recent market lows) so you can sell them again later.If you are in a situation where you have a lot of cash and can't reasonably handle major expansion (e.g. adding a new building isn't feasible because you don't have enough skilled staff to handle a launch on top of the other expansions you already have in process) then buying stocks back makes sense.   It is investing in your own company to help set up funds for future growth.  The problem is not stock buy backs existing as concept.  Even in cases where people are angry about buy backs they are generally pointing to areas where employers cut corners on things safety, quality, infrastructure or staffing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 21:02:44'] these headlines are bogus. I ended up reading his annual letter because I thought there's no way he would make such an ignorant statement -- and he didn't. He mentions that companies abuse stock buybacks and that not all buybacks are good ideas.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:16:53'] He’s right, and also right to say what he did. Sadly progressives will keep beating the drum of buybacks and dividends being evil….. Because returning cash to the people that own a business is somehow unethical.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 16:08:16'] I am seeing a short term bear market rally, short term charts are showing break out, weekly chart bullish as hell. The only thing that stands in the way of a green day tomorrow is the Job claim data. If it comes out "badish good", looking at a gap up probably. Otherwise you all know the drill...

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 19:59:52'] SPY has been in the same bear channel for 2+ months at this point. I refuse to even entertain the idea that the bottom is in until we break from it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 14:01:03'] I'm betting we gap over and go 384 tomorrow or by Friday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 16:11:05'] I don’t think CPI will be bullish next week. Energy cost and food cost have been going up. I think it will come in line and the media will scream STAGFLATION! This is a big dead cat bounce. Pure hopium, wait till realty sets in.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 16:53:07'] Everyone has been ultra dialed into the seasonality of October vs. the rising doom of stagflation + bear trend + the world coming to terms with and accepting recession for the next year to year and a half. I also agree that we won't see more real downside til at least the end of next week. I made a good 20% return scalping puts at good entry, but I'm still kicking myself for not sticking to calls last Friday into the close. Every time I commit to long positions, that's when the market capitulates.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-05 18:27:47'] So if CPI comes back bad how low do you see spy dropping by the end of October?  From everything I’m seeing around me I find it hard to believe that inflation has dropped at all.

Went heavy on calls at the bottom, secured some profits and was so confident on swinging them. I was up $13k for the day, then at a hear beat spy dropped and evaporated all morning profits and had to sell at a massive loss that drop scared me.total net gain was like $200 for the day lmfao.I love how every time you think you figure this shit out, the market humbles you right back down. I am so happy I didn’t blow up my account, and lived to trade another day, but giving back that much money stings man. Taking the rest of the week off to reset myself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-18 14:48:39'] Great TA, personally I thought today was going to be a lot more bullish but the Vix really showed that the whole market wasn’t ready for 375+ on spy yet.

Your information may be pointing to a down quarter in q4.  I would be very cautious getting short of AAPL in the shorter term tho.  This rally feels just like June and I remember tech companies actually popping on crap earnings.

POST_TEXT: b'Today was the eve of CPI and easily was one of the weirdest trading days I have seen in a long time Intraday we watched overall volume trend extreme bull almost all day and despite that SPY struggled most of the day after it hit 411.73 during opening hour. Overall a really tough day to trade. Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 13:51:26'] It’s quite surprising that the market is fully focused on CPI. But there’s little on core cpi, if that comes in hot which it could even if regular is in line that could be very bad for markets. For the amount that oil has declined if there’s not a significant beat it could be seen as inflation being very sticky at a high level.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 14:02:23'] Agreed with the totally weird day though i did get lucky with the 412 0DTE puts i bought in the morning as I had planned. Tomorrow all bets are off and I think markets will surprise again. I predict a not so big a pop on favorabel CPI but a massive dump on bad CPI.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 16:24:13'] VIX up over 4.7% on a green day- I smell red tomorrow unless CPI much lower than expectations
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 17:50:44'] Inverse Cramer led me to double down on 9/16 411P. Your DD is good but inverse Cramer just is too powerful. Honestly should’ve done a tight straddle.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 16:54:27'] There is so much bullishness on this thread and in the media . Higher probability is  we dump since we have rallied from 3900 to a straight line. Also 1/3 of CPI is housing and rents are still climbing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 09:39:54'] Stay bearish and wait for technical levels to re-enter puts. In this market it's not worth switching sides constantly. Until we're back in a bull market all we got is these rallies that constantly get rug pulled just around the time people tend to switch sides. Otherwise you just end up chasing and then lose out big from massive sell offs like today.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-13 13:14:07'] Days like today make it so hard to play the stock market ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-12 14:12:36'] Even if we dump, there’s has been this “buying the dip” price action, since last week. I’m riding $420 weekly calls. My thesis is we can potentially see a $420s by Wednesday and really start making bank by Friday. Every mini sell off will be bought right back up, so any dips on the $400 levels, is a major buying call opportunity. Good luck on your calls!

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-24 10:55:48'] With apple as the biggest stock in the market and the biggest share of SPY. If there was some catalyst to come out against apple in a bad way. How much would a 5% drop to apple mean to the rest of the market? that would be 120 billion wiped from apples value. One of the ways I look at it is apple is the number 1 stock to store cash. Not gonna see massive volatility and holds its own. But with the rest of the market getting demolished and apple holding its own you would have to think some of that big money would sell out of apple and go into different stocks that are down 70% on the year. Basically when the market starts to rally you might see someone people take their cash out of apple to switch over to more volatile stocks. Basically I believe we either see apple hold its own in the 150-160 range for quite sometime or we see a downtrend in the 15% range in the next month. Overall it just seems to me apple is holding the market together and if it we’re to drop big time we’re looking at some all across the board serious drops. My 2 cents

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 14:23:15'] Seems like you kept saying something like "and then we managed to rally out of 357" ... you know Brainard spoke today right? Markets interpreted it as somewhat dovish. But when Evans spoke this morning, he was hawkish hence the morning dump. The rally out of the LOY was *literally* as Brainard opened her mouth lmao
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 13:41:16'] I am looking at flat to bearish for next 2 days before cpi, because 10Y hit near 4 again and dollar value went up to near high as well. When the bond market resume trading tomorrow we could see 4+, last time that happen market hit a new low, we could see another low tomorrow or wednesday just as nasdap hit a new today.I do agree we are in oversold zone, we've stuck at this range trading for a while now, it could very well be trading within this range again. Vix probably needs to above 35 for me to believe that we are getting a bounce again this time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 14:21:02'] Sold 5 SPY puts $360 10/17 for a couple hundred profit today hopefully it was the right move! haha maybe I need bigger balls.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 14:12:20'] Bought TSLA calls, 225 weeklies. Hopefully sell tomorrow for a small profit.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 14:07:41'] I'm relatively new to TA. I have Apple trapped between 138 and 143 for the week? You think that's a fair assessment? I do believe, like you, if we break below 138, that we might go for 130 this week, providing core CPI is really bad. Microsoft is the other big guy that is sending the clearest signal where tech might go. Look at its daily chart and the Nasdaq. Almost a perfect match. What do you think?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-10 17:14:13'] Nice job, noticed the same thing and bought calls for the spy.  Short term play, but might as well cash in tomorrow and maybe Wed.

POST_TEXT: b'Well after SPY made a 52week low last week to close the day there was a lot of talk about a black Monday and that SPY was about to hit -3% today well the bulls came out and said not so fast! \n\nOverall on Apple and SPY there are some major bull milestones hit, however, Tesla had a VERY rough day today \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3yehqax3pnr91.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98ea1f3dfda9f97fc3a1cbb3c49441db97c8de6f\n\nTaking a look at SPY daily chart here we broke through that blue falling wedge. This is the resistance line we have been trading under since before CPI. However, we attempted to break through the daily 8ema resistance which also was key resistance at 368.1. While we were able to peak out head over it momentarily we saw a really good sized pullback EOD to close under the daily 8ema and soft resistance at 366.8. Overall this is a bearish finish to a very green day and honestly this reminds me almost perfectly of last Wednesday. \n\nIf we can get a conti'
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 16:30:29'] I think this is the start of one last relief rally. Before… the big one. At least my calls hope so
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 17:57:13'] Sold calls I swung. Bought puts at end of day. Probably a few too many. This rally may last a day or so. But that EMA 8 rejection sold me. Nice trading today. We are both on a streak.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 14:57:18'] I bought lots of puts on this morning. I guess I’m f’d up?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 14:37:42'] I wasn't so patient this time and went in with apple call spreads first thing in the morning, planning to add more if the strength continues tomorrow or if spy continue to hold June bottom. Almost 4-5 candles already trying to break, if we still not breaking the 360 level this week, I don't see it breaking until the next bad cpi data or bad earning week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 14:41:31'] The only pivot the bulls are going to get will be from their ass to their mouth as JPOW gets ready to blow his load
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 15:28:58'] Obviously Friday was a bear trap and we finally got a little relief but I still am hesitant to be bullish.  I personally feel like today was a bull trap and we see downside tomorrow.  All in all I see the market just chopping between 370 and 360, like we saw last week, until next CPI.  Then depending on that we rocket.  Which direction I have no idea lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 15:38:53'] Impressive trading day especially consider you were struggling with trend days. I definitely should’ve sold my puts early today and played calls for the day but it felt like one of those reversal days where we sell off midday and end red. We’ll see what tomorrow brings. If we go green again I’m selling my puts and will consider either calls or just sit cash. Given the BOE QE news last week and the rumors about Credit Sussie this weekend. I don’t want to get stuck not paying attention with calls
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 17:55:47'] Dang you crushed it today. Im glad i held onto my msft and spy calls i opened friday afternoon but i was definitely sweating it over the weekend. Closed everything, missed a bit of profit but i didnt think we'd get through 365/366 honestly. Glad i resisted the temptation to open any new positions the rest of the day, trying to learn from past mistakes. I feel like this rally has legs. Im feeling a dump tomorrow morning followed by v bottom up to 369 maybe touch 370
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 18:44:41'] Are you holding anything overnight?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-03 19:11:07'] I don't think you are correct that it would be the 3rd cpi decrease in a row. Didn't we go from 8.5% to 8.3% then back to 8.5% last month?
