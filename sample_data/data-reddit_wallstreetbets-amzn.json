So, buckle up and let's dive into this rollercoaster of a story.\\n\\nIt was earnings week for the tech giants - you know, the likes of $META, $GOOG, and $MSFT. And then, the star of this post: $AMZN. I started building my position back when $FDX beat earnings in March, grabbing 500 shares at a neat $100/share, and then adding another 1000 shares on April 21st just under $107.\\n\\nWhy, you ask? Simple. More packages = Ecommerce boom = analysts being dumbasses. Then, $UPS missed earnings and I decided to drop 500 of my $AMZN shares 'cause your boy ain't about to lose the house over Bezos baby.\\n\\nSo, this week was wild. The market had a seizure during trading hours, but then $MSFT & $GOOG reported and it's like we hopped on a rocket straight to the moon. Tech stocks went absolutely bonkers and I caught $M\"",

When it did, I took the opportunity to buy more and so now my avg cost is down to 102. Currently holding about 150 shares.\\n\\nI want to try and gauge market sentiment on Amazon here by seeing what you all think. Is it going to continue flat around $100? Is it going to surge tomorrow? I have definitely noticed a trend for the last few weeks or even months that it tends to spike up on Wednesday and Thursdays most often. It seems like there is a lot of resistance, presumably from people who dont fully understand the breadth of Amazons offerings, their leading position in ALL retail segments, and the insane investments in automation they have been/are making.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts?'",

     "Dude. If you were an expert in this field you\u2019d know a few things:\n\n1.\tIt\u2019s fucking spelled \u201cKuiper\u201d not \u201cKuipar\u201d\n2.\tKuiper is a long ways away from even launching those 600kg satellites. They\u2019re launching two small test satellites at the end of the year. Launching the bigger satellites is sometime in 2024 - at best. \n3.\tmost importantly - Kuiper is building their reaction wheels in house. Kuiper is notorious for wanting to control their components. \n\nOn the last item, here\u2019s a quote from the Head of Kuiper- \n\n>\t\u201cAffordability is Job One for us,\u201d said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. \u201cThat\u2019s really important for us to keep that cost low, because if we don\u2019t, it\u2019s very difficult to get the unserved and underserved connected to our service. So we took on the challenge to design our satellites two orders of magnitude cheaper.\u201d\n\n>\tThere are no glimpses, however, at the satellites themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re designing the solar arrays, we\u2019re designing the reaction wheels,\u201d Badyal said.\n\nA $100k reaction wheel is fucking expensive and can definitely be made cheaper.\n\nEdit: this is either an obvious P&D or OP has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. My comment got downvoted seconds after I posted it. Someone didn\u2019t like the factual information."

These same 3rd party sellers are upset because Amazon is raising fees, taking over 50% of an item price to pay for logistics & delivery.  Meanwhile Walmart & Target now offer fast delivery with no membership required.  Anyone who is still bullish on Amazon is ignoring all of the problems they need to fix to keep growing."

     "\\#1 - 1/2 of these are not catalysts lol .... CES ? our team is meeting with our amazon buyer at CES. This is our 3rd new buyer in 6 months, turn over is real and the buyers have no fkin clue what they're doing. CES is getting smaller every year because its really not a valuable show to attend, most of the stuff is prototype shit thats not even available for sale. with amazon's fee structure every company is actively trying to find more ways to sell on every platform except amazon. AWS is the only thing saving them.  \n\\#2-#3 doesnt mean its going to be good...  \n\\#4 CPI could go either way   \n\\#6 It can always go lower P/E still way out of line for new era of value stocks  \n\n\nI'd be more interested at $60/share or less"

     "I hate dumb lists... It reminds me of some people with political discussions who have lists of irrelevant things to post in response to any reasonable discussion, even if the list makes no sense.\n\nNow, to be clear I think AMZN is a great company and have invested in them before and made good money if that investment, but I did sell a little while back because I was having trouble with the value case for them (not that my other investments did much better, but felt it was time to pull out of AMZN...).\n\nSo let's take a look at your list for the heck of it.\n\n1. CES 2023 on Jan 5th. - Who cares. This is an annual event that has zero impact on the long-term fundamentals of AMZN.\n2. Earnings Feb 1st. - And so? Every company that has declined in value had earnings at some time or another as well as every company that has gone up. It is just a day that info may come out that will move the price, not a guarantee which way.\n3. Last years Feb earnings was the biggest move in stock market history (+14%). - As they say in investing... prior results do not guarantee future performance.\n4. CPI Jan 12th. - So invest one way or another in SPY as that reflects the impact of CPI better than an individual stock.\n5. UMICH Jan 13th. - No clue what this means\n6. New 52W low. - Whoopee doo... Every stock before it reaches it current 52 week low, reached a prior one... which means nothing. Stocks can go up or down regardless of lows or highs.\n7. They pump the stock Feb/March because the number stock refreshers to employees is based on average Feb share price. - Ok... not even going to bother with this.\n8. Consensus EPS is a softball. - I think the consensus for Q4 is $0.20, which comes to under $1 annualized, which means AMZN is trading at a 85X+ PE ratio.\n9. Cost-cutting happening right now (layoffs 10%, Alexa deprioritized). - cost cutting is necessary but perhaps sales will be down and profits impacted in any case... meaning the cost-cutting is keeping things afloat as opposed to making them profitable.\n\nMy take... maybe it goes up, maybe it goes down... definitely this DD you have done is crap though.\n\nMaybe try real DD next time... Like if you exclude AWS from the picture, AMZN lost $10 billion in the last 12 months. Or how if you exclude AWS, AMZN barely makes money. As to AWS, during the last few years growth was very strong, but has recently slowed down. In any case would take several years of strong growth to justify even current share prices. Basically an investment in AMZN is a bet that they can turn their retail business not a massive money-maker and that AWS will continue to show strong growth for the next 5 years. My guess is Q4 will not answer these questions and will leave a lot of doubt as to the future potential of AMZN and if it can grow fast enough to justify the share price."

     ">1. I believe that CES 2023 will be a very important event for Amazon. They are likely to unveil new products and services that could have a major impact on their business.\n2. Earnings for Amazon in February could also be extremely significant, as they will provide updated guidance for the year ahead.\n3. Last year's February earnings were the biggest move in stock market history (+14%), so there is potential for more upside this time around if results are strong again.\n4 CPI data from January 12th will be closely watched by investors as it can give clues about inflationary pressure in the economy which may impact Amazon's margins going forward 5 UMICH consumer sentiment data due on January 13th could also shed some light on how consumers are feeling about spending money online 6 If AMZN shares continue to fall and make new 52-week lows, this could trigger further selling pressure 7 Some analysts believe that employees at Amazon receive stock refreshers based on the average share price during February, so there may be some positive buying activity around this time 8 The consensus EPS estimate for Amazon is currently $1532 , which represents decent growth from last year 9 Finally, cost-cutting measures taken by management recently (such as layoffs of 10% of staff) suggest that they are focused on improving profitability"

     "After it releases the current horrible earnings, yes.\n\nI wrote about it here today - [https://www.jika.io/post/192c0b9a-a305-11ed-8080-80001dae70c1](https://www.jika.io/post/192c0b9a-a305-11ed-8080-80001dae70c1?rdt)\n\nbut here is a TL:DR:\n\n**AWS in 2023**\n\nAWS has shown consistent revenue growth ever since Q1 of 2021, and even though the growth rate slowed substantially since Q4 of 2021, it continues to grow and will continue to grow. When recession and inflation stabilize we are sure to see higher growth rate with more companies connect to the AWS services. \n\n**Non-AWS in 2023**\n\nIt's fair to estimate that after almost 2 years of bad and unusual economy, now when things are set to be stabilizing, Amazon's non-AWS services will surpass or at the very least breakeven the -$11.4B gap they left last year.\n\n**Is Amazon a Buy?**\n\nIn my opinion, Amazon is going to be facing some more slight decreases in the short term, as we haven't left inflation and recession threat completely yet. As for where the winds are blowing, it's easy to see that 2023 is going to mark the end of this weird market and the rise of companies like Amazon.   \nFor a long term, Amazon shows a great opportunity for investment to me. But wait at least until they release their horrible Q4 report before buying."

However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!\\n\\n**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  \\nSo the options market prices the options based on probabilities. There's a theory that the sum of the premiums of the call and put options for the **AT THE MONEY (ATM) strike**, divided by the strike p\"",

In the last six months your 20% would have been buying stock for cheap.  Trading can earn you a lot but you can see not everyone is really cut out for it.  By simply investing you'll have a 7 figure nest egg and you'll support the economy.   Cheers."

     ">It is good to see you, DeadSol. I am doing well, thank you for asking. As for your question, the current Amazon stock price of $94.18 is below my breakeven point of $101.66, so I would not recommend exercising your option at this time. However, given the overall positive trend in the stock market lately, it's possible that Amazon's share price could rise above my breakeven point in the future and at that point it might make sense to exercise your option and sell shares of Amazon stock at a profit. Thanks for letting me know what you're thinking and happy Thanksgiving!"

There\u2019s a few really nice houses borderline mansions on a gorgeous lake off this road and fuck if they didn\u2019t expand the roads right up their ass.  Amazon can get shit done.  Look at bezos with this fucking historical Dutch bridge.  Amazon is a powerful powerful entity and I wouldn\u2019t judge one little quarter during one of the most divisive crazed time periods in the past 10 years.  I\u2019m just gonna hold my shares and not mess with options in this volatile market."

Advertising services grew 32% year over year to $9.7 billion during the quarter. Previously, Amazon included advertising revenue in its \u201cother\u201d business segment. While advertising has always been viewed as a tangential business for Amazon, the company has had so much success attracting ad dollars that it\u2019s now third in the U.S. market, behind Google and Facebook. Google reported fourth-quarter ad revenue of $61.2 billion, while Facebook notched ad sales of $32.6 billion in the period.\n\nTheir EPS has nothing to fucking do with the jump in price.

Rising inflation will cut into profit margin especially if they decide to offer competitive pricing comparable to their competitors. Which, they\u2019ve had a history with in the past. Their profit margin has always been very thin. I just wanna help some of you guys sometimes lol. Also you should make a rule with yourself to never buy an option with less then a month till rip.

I think you're less likely to see a huge valuation drop than maybe a little blip if he goes boom, but it would likely be short lived. \n\n* Blue Origin has a much better track record and engineering design than Virgin Galactic - no failures in like a dozen tests vs. several failures in like 3 tests for VG, including a fatality. New Shepard is an autonomous vehicle, Spaceship 2 needs to be hand flown by the pilot, which introduces a lot of room for error as seen by the fatal flight. \n\n* $SPCE is going to have insane volatility one way or another - I think the biggest concern is picking an expiry that factors in potential launch delays, which would probably result in a slight dip but not a crash. \n\nI'm going to be opening a 7/16 strangle on $SPCE (probably like 35p/60c) on Friday with a target movement of about 50% in the underlying.

I am buying puts and here's why.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1.) **Amazon-owned Twitch recently started taking more money from creator revenues** (Source:  [A Letter from Twitch President Dan Clancy on Subscription Revenue Shares | Twitch Blog](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2022/09/21/a-letter-from-twitch-president-dan-clancy-on-subscription-revenue-shares/) ) The days of being alive and unprofitable are over, and the numbers need to start looking better. This reminds me of when $NFLX raised their prices right before a historically terrible earnings call. I am expecting something similar this time as well. I think its simple that amazon needs more money and is cracking down on twitch to boost their numbers.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2.) **Out of the blue Prime Day 2** (technically called Prime Early Access Sales but I call it prime day 2) Trying to get rid of excess inventory? Trying to pad sales numbers? I am not sure but it doesn't look good to me.  Data suggests lighter sales than Prime \"",

Sad people really. If you think this is seriously gambling then yea be safe but there is a reason you got into it, if you think you have talent maybe play a bit longer and deep dive, figure out what you really think things will do, not just gambling. If you can do that you could grow it even more. Be safe and stay true to yourself. I\u2019m 19 bruh I blown up crazy amounts but I\u2019ve made lots too. Down rn but we on our way back up."

  "Text": "b'As the title says, AMZN is gonna do a historic 20-for-1 split and its finally coming. I want to be part of history. I think this is bullish despite the mess the market is currently in. A bear market rally is over due as well. This could align the stars to make AMZN a good swing trade until after the split.\\n\\nSo when is it exactly?\\n\\nhttps://investorplace.com/2022/03/when-is-the-amazon-stock-split-date-what-will-happen-to-amzn-stock/\\n\\n> The first will be May 27, 2022, which will serve as the record date. That means if you want to participate in the stock split, you must own AMZN stock by May 27. Individual accounts will start to update to reflect the stock split by June 3, 2022. Finally, AMZN will start trading on what is called a split-adjusted basis by June 6, 2022. That is when investors will start to notice the lower share price.\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure there\\'s gonna be plenty of confusion about the record date and the \"must own\" phrasing of the above text, but this date doesn\\'t really matte'",

I personally get  4 deliveries a week  saving me time , fuel , and best of all  the best prices out there .  This is where people will shop in a recession and also in good times . AMZN is the KING OF RETAIL  and always will be .  Take a look at the long list of companies they are growing into profit farms it is truly amazing .   This will be a huge FOMO event at prices  as low as this  and we could double our investment in a short period. This will split at  $122.50 and  then  by 2024 -25  be well over  $4000  again possible for even  higher . I bought  Bershire Hataway years ago for the same reason  and plan on Amazon giving me even better returns .  Thank you"

     "If hedge funds are invested in amzn and if they have to liquidate their assets during the flush, at the current price, does this make amzn more of a clever trap? The reason being is that retail will get access to their split shares after the big institutions have received their split and tanked the price. And not only that. After the split has occurred. Hedge funds could short amzn to take advantage of retail selling their shares after them. \n\nI think puts on amzn seem better."

     ">1) I think that the most important thing for people to remember when investing is to always stay disciplined and not get emotional. This can be difficult at times, but it is crucial in order to make sound investment decisions.\n\n2) Another important factor to consider when investing is diversification. Diversifying one's portfolio across different asset classes and industries can help mitigate risk and improve returns over time.\n\n3) Finally, it is also important to have a clear understanding of your goals before making any investments. What are you trying to achieve with your investments? Are you looking for short-term gains or long-term growth? Once you know your goals, you can better align your investment strategy accordingly."

Market has likely reached saturation like $NFLX reached.\\n\\n2 - This is a gambit to create short term hype. If you review FY21 financials they generate no free cash flow (cash from ops - capex - stock based comp). A $10 billion buyback ONLY keeps their share count flat at best. It does not reduce it. (509k -503k = 6k. 6k / 503k = 1.2% dilution. 1.2% dilution on 1.6 trillion market cap means it requires almost $20 billion free cash flow to buyback the stock comp.

All of the negative economic doom and gloom going on right now has been predicted for almost two years now. That\u2019s why such a sharp decline happened *before* any actual negative economic indicators started showing up.\n\nIt. Is. Priced. In.\n\nEDIT: for those who don\u2019t understand, think about it this way\u2026\n\n99% of wsb being bearish and buying puts does nothing to lower stock prices. The *only* thing that lowers stock prices is sell orders overpowering buy orders. When talking about SPY, that means institutions and wealthy boomers panicking.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to short an individual stock. With SPY, the baseline is billions of new dollars being pumped into the market every week via 401k contributions alone. It takes some actual unexpected economic news to outweigh that and we\u2019re still 12% off all time highs."

Despite the fact that there are high interest rates, slowing retail spending, layoffs, high debt, low cash reserves- the sky appears to not be falling. It will however, happen in some places. \\n\\nRight now, there are industries, cities, and technologies that are going to suffer, but there are also ones that will do well. There are cities, for example, that are ripe for a housing crash (San Francisco, Phoenix, Nashville). There are industries and companies who, if they dont keep up with AI, wont make it. The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasnt broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats. \\n\\nAll of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will '",

The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.\\n\\nJ.P.

     "**$ORCL earnings play (post mortem)**  \nLots of ways to win on this one. Always easier in hinesight. \n\n**Pre-ER Straddle/Strangle**  \nLooks like if you purchased an $ORCL strangle/straddle prior to the recent run out that would have printed. If you bought yesterday, who ever sold you those call options did a little bit of a happy dance today.  Looks like $ORCL held $120-$121 for a little bit, enough time to sell those call options. If you went with the C110, which last Thursday was at the money, that would have went from $2 -> $12 (selling at 9:45AM). If you did that in a reasonable straddle or strangle, you costs to enter the position would have been about $6. That would return about +100%. \n\n**Post-ER Scalping (1 Trade)**\n\nIf you were in a post-ER scalping mood, you would have picked up the $118 PUT around 10AM, and rode that like the 1 trick pony it was all day long. 10AM price about $1. 4PM price about $2.45. Which would have been a nice +136% for relatively little work.\n\n  \n**Post-ER Scaling (3 Trades)**  \nIf you were in a post-ER day scalping day trade mood, you would have picked it up through some of the drop offs, get caught in a few minor spikes, but ultimately be a winner on the day. (+14%).  \nTrade 1: 10:18 -> 12:43 (P118 -- +24%)  \nTrade 2: 13:19 -> 14:15 (C120) -- -34%)  \nTrade 3: 14:45 -> 15:52 (P118 -- +24%)"

     "Most of the news lately tried to demolish the bull thesis saying that Total is unloading shares heavily... On seeking Alpha they also wrote a wrong headline saying that Total sold 10 million share, while the count as of 08/06 should be 6.4 million.\r  \n\n\nTotal needs to [finance the JV](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005231/en/Clean-Energy-and-Total-Sign-Joint-Venture-to-Develop-Carbon-Negative-Fuel-and-Infrastructure) with $CLNE, whose budget can be considered expensive for an oil major too:\n\n\r  \n*\"The initial firm commitment is $100 million and can increase to $400 million as development opportunities progress. Since Clean Energy and Total will be providing the equity portion of the investments, the actual amount of capital invested in RNG projects may be higher than $400 million depending on the amount of leverage that is deployed. In addition, Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain, including $45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure.\"*\r\n\nWhy cash is so important for RNG projects? It is important because in order to win the assignation of RNG projects (whose scale is increasing over time) you need to be the highest bidder. Many are competing to get these lucrative projects (Chevron, $ENB, single small companies previously active only in the ethanol segments)\r\n\nWhat $CLNE has that others have not is the distribution network...and look what Chevron is doing: [Chevron brands its first CNG retail site](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brands-its-first-cng-retail-site) *\"Chevron U.S.A. Inc. announced the Allied Clean Fuels Plaza retail station in Napa, California, has been rebranded as its first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) site. Chevron expects to rebrand or open more than 30 CNG sites by 2025.\"*"

     "While I'm a complete newbie on the stocks and investing side of things, I do have some expertise in low carbon alternatives. There is a huge cloud for this in the medium/long term. It's a great short term play to move towards carbon neutrality but there are far better (and cheaper) solutions on the horizon. Pretty much every diesel truck manufacturer knows the days of diesel are numbered. Cummins is throwing $1B at fuel cell development.  Even CLNE pays lip service to it on their web site talking about using their product to  make hydrogen or electricity...It's highly unlikely they'd be competitive with other technologies to make either.   \n\n\nWhile Jeff probably won't give Elon an order for Tesla semis virtually every other truck manufacturer is also working to develop them and as soon as they reach cost parity, it's game over for diesels, it won't matter what fuel they're burning... Once they're here the switch will happen and fast... Logistics managers will sell their mothers to save 2 cents a hundred weight... At that point  RNG loses a lot of it's advantages...  While CLNE  talks about RNG being used to make electricity, unless they can undercut historically low natural gas prices and make a profit,  that's a nonstarter.  Bloomberg is already predicting as much as $35B in gas fired power plants as stranded assets by 2030 unable to compete with cheaper renewables (and that's even factoring in cheap NG)  so if they're closing who are they going to sell the RNG to to make electricity from it? Same is true for hydrogen... While today the dominant source of H2 is reforming methane unless you can undercut the H2 from electrolysis of water from surplus solar  you're going to be in the same boat.. They're probably safe for the next two years... after that... hard to tell..."

See quote from their ER last quarter:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n>Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November.[Sauce](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/business_and_financial_update.pdf)\\n\\nWill the street ignore their negative EPS and focus on AWS growth? My assumption is EPS will miss, primarily due to the markdown - however if AWS growth is flat or also declines, AMZN's in for a huge red day.\\n\\nThoughts?\\n\\nEdit: Last quarter EPS: $27.25 actual vs $3.88 estimate.

     "correct me if im wrong please... but historically before every stock split the stock rallies then the split happens and the stock normally gets sold off and falls in price that was the case with apple at least then it traded sideways for months before it started to gain again with earnings etc.\n\nSo why buy stock specially if you missed the initial run up like in teslas case why not just buy leaps when the stock splits and ride those for a year or two. For one they will be much cheaper since the price has been reduced and you will still make the same amount of money if not more since you can now afford to buy more calls or even shares at that point.\n\nEdit: I should clarify im not saying tesla shares are going to fall in price after the split but they will remain stagnant for a while or they could rocket as the stock would be much more affordable for young investors... but i think some of you are confused as to you making more money when the stock splits. Your one share is now 10 shares etc but your money does not change.. Its the same as you waiting for the stock to split and buying the same amount of shares at that price instead of jumping in when the stock is close to ATH"

Even my buddy who\u2019s networth is closer to 40 million and is a 1% trader has not gone higher than 600 contracts with a month or so expiration. Although his long term stocks can make him a million a day just by holding he doesn\u2019t go for bust on his portfolio. At 2 million dollars OP should literally throw this in dividend stocks and VOO and quit forever. You won. You got 2 million."

I bought high though\n\nAMZN Seemed like a good chance to buy the dip last year i think around march or april the day it tanked after earnings\n\nQQQ I sold puts and got assigned. Been selling covered calls for a year. Average is around 280s\n\nSOFI I dont know why i bought. I was just gonna swing it for a week but it tanked and ever recovered\n\nTQQQ Originally wanted to swing trade it but i couldnt bring myself to cutting losses\n\nTSLA I couldve sold at 210s but i had a collar at the time and i didnt want to take the loss on the collar\n\nShorts\n\nAAPL Stonk too high. no other reason\n\nNVDA Returded >130% pump. It has to dump soon right?\n\nNVDA Puts same reason \\^\n\nNVDA Naked Calls. I didnt feel comfortable added more shares to the short at the moment so i sold calls instead hoping to get a better entry + premiums. I collected around 1500 from the apr expirations and i hope to collect the full amount of these may expirations too\n\nQQQ Covered call. Just to lower my average some more\n\nShort Futes\n\nI figured i should hedge my account with futes since i have quite a few long positions. Unfortunately i couldnt bring myself to close them at a loss so i kept adding to it which makes me overall a net short portfolio\n\nTsla Strangle. i thought that would be a wide enough range for the stock to move around and collect some risk free money"

     "Yes, but it is unlikely considering your positions.\n\nI have dig myself out of -30% to like -3% last week and I belive this week I'm breaking even and will catch up with SPY. \n\nI probably don't belong here for saying this, but what worked for me was selling everything at one point and going 100% cash. After that I waited for buying opportunity. What I did was waited for one of the bigger drops and loaded on high quality stuff dragged down by the market - mostly healthcare(CI, UNH, CNC), but not only and sold again on the next rise. Companies that I woudn't mind holding anyways for longer, for as cheap as possible. Basically swing trading, only stocks, not a single option. Took the money at average 5% gain on position, but I got 2-3 positions at most with 80% invested so if I make 5% on each of the 3 positions is like 10-12% total portfolio gain. And this seems to be working - buy low sell high. Not having exp. date helps a lot to wait it out until it pops. Never traded hyped up stocks, never will.\n\nWhat do you expect from AMD at 95PE? What could reallisticly happen to that stock - five times more expensive than the average SPY company? Go to 150 PE? You are just gambling there, with extremely high chances of losing and very tiny chance of making insignificant profit. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kluwylj0g9wa1.jpeg?width=1584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c00ef23b0efd9977be07fcaf388605a0154abab0"

I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&P 500s +8%.\\n\\nHere are what analysts expect:\\n\\n* Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts\\n\\n* Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv\\n\\n* Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)\\n\\nThey're expecting a drop in Disneys second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies. \\n\"",

     "Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. \n\nHad people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; \n\nhttps://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/\n\nIf anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask. I'll lay it all out for you"

Anyways, UPS loses the package and thank fuck I paid for $1600 worth of insurance. After a month of fighting with them they say they will pay the claim. They sent me $100 check in the mail. I called and asked why the hell they arent sending me $1600 and now I am fighting with them more.

With Bezos dying, 30% of Amazon's entire float would vanish into thin air since he controls most shares. A dead guy cant sell his shares, so we could technically treat this event as a giant 1 Trillion dollar $AMZN stock buyback, which would happen instantly.

Keeping Shorty Shadow aside Lemonade is disrupting a Trillion Dollar Market. Global Insurance is huge over one trillion for just AUTO INSURANCE. The problem or market has been solved by the same old legacy insurance providers like GEICO, State Farm, All State, Liberty Mutual on and on. These legacy providers have milked a market with little change for centuries which provides Lemonade $LMND the opportunity to disrupt at lightening speed with a digital platform AI, Machine Learnings that allows them to acquire new customers at 1/10th the cost of legacy providers. This same digital platform also allows $LMND to manage losses more efficiently thus delivering greater customer satisfaction. Let face it the dumb commercials on TV do nothing. This is what happens when you have no real difference in your offering. You run dumb TV commercials like that gecko of GEICO but what insurance '",

If the consensus line is 3 on an NBA game and a particularly sharp sports book for NBA wagers moves to 2.5, you want to be on the side of the bettors who moved the line by betting +3. Hours later when you see 3 no longer exists anywhere, and the consensus is 2, you can know you made a good bet.\n\nHow you accomplish this is a more elaborate story, but being on the right side of line movement is key to winning long term."

Inflation indicators turned hotter in April with consumer spending leading the way. The US economy showed signs of a rebound in last week's ISM report, while global demand remained soft. The Q1 earnings season is coming to an end with results exceeding expectations. However, things may not be as bright under the hood. Regional and small bank pain may not have ended yet, with deposit outflow and commercial real estate being their biggest risks.\\n\\n# Market-moving News\\n\\n**The Fed hike 25bp and putting pause on the table.** On Wednesday, the Fed hiked another 25bp, marking the tenth consecutive raise and bringing the benchmark rate to 5-5.25%. This decision pleased both bulls and bears, as JP raised the possibility of a pause in June while emphasizing that the decision would depend \"",

AMZN had an $11.9B swing, and a smaller share - 63% of the swing - was due to Rivian. They also forecast uncertain earnings going forward, warning that they could post another loss. \n\nThe part about Rivian should not have a large per share impact on AMZN - although if you\u2019re not familiar with it, the phenomenon where a parent stock has a bigger drop than the loss in value of the daughter stock - there is a famous example of this involving 3M that\u2019s always brought up in behavioral economics. But the reality is that Rivian has a very small market cap compared to AMZN (not so much compared to F) - diluted on a per share basis that loss is small - even if the entire AMZN investment in Rivian loses its entire value, from here, it ought to only lead to a <1% decline in AMZN\u2019s value. \n\nBut the market is also forward looking, and if AMZN is going to have increasing difficulty making money on its product sales (vs services) then that\u2019s a bad fundamental for a company that has a really large product footprint. \n\nSome of the headlines on Ford were also unfair - they said that Ford was losing money because of its bet on electric - but Ford is doing nicely on sales of their electric vehicles - in the long run, if the Lightning F150 succeeds (and as a former engineer, electric makes so much sense for pickup trucks) then remember how many pickup trucks North Americans buy."

Since your option adventures are so profitable you have the pulse of the market and its infinitely easier to trade stocks. So what if SPY goes from $470 to even $400 you wait it out for the eventual return to $485 lol. Having the cash to micro trade 4000 shares of SPY is pretty good, slower than options but you are as good as gold or better. I would also save my mental energy by going for two tickers at the maximum, at least for me even one is more tiring than even a full time job, which is why Goldman etc have specialist for each ticker.**"

If Amazon cared that much about the technology - they would simply buy them. Amazon absolutely does not ever let a single company hold that much power over them.

And super villains are usually mega-successful financially. Or in movies at least.\\n\\nAlso his wife left him, so there\\'s no reason for him to hold back on pushing the company to the moon anymore. If $AMZN values at $100 trillion tomorrow, no one will come split his fortune from him.\\n\\nMy last bullish argument is that Jeffee is dismantling a historical bridge for his mega yacht. I view this as very bullish for two reasons: 1) Jeff ain\\'t stopping at nothing to get what he wants. Say what you want but the U.S. economy reward those with ambition and aren\\'t afraid to hurt others to get what they want; 2) Jeff likes to spend his cash in an \"african-american\" rich style. To maintain this lifestyle, you\\'ve gotta keep them monaaaeyyy coming.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere you go, three short bullish thesis. Go on and buy some calls on $AMZN. T'",

Amazon's main selling point is convenience. You want something, it's at your door in 2 days or less. Wish's main selling point is low prices for stuff you don't really need. It's fun to go on Wish when you're drunk and spend \u00a310 on a load of weird shit and then forget about it until they arrive in a couple of months. No one who actually needs anything buys it on Wish. It's like comparing a dollar store to Target or a pound shop to Argos. It might be even worse than that. It might be like comparing gypsy markets you get in town on a Sunday to Argos or Target, except you have to wait 2 months for it to arrive"

     "You need to break down AMZN down into its segments. AWS and Prime make up the bulk of their profits. E-commerce and warehousing do not make as much but the structure of the business is quite different to WISH. \n\nI would say that WISH is disrupting Dollar Tree, Thrift/Novelty shops. Wish has a lot of unique items that you won't find anywhere else.\n\nI am very bullish. They utilize customer payments and long shipping times to effectively get free financing for their operations so in the long run they won't need capital to keep the business running. Right now they have a huge marketing spend so you want to watch that along with MAU growth, and perhaps AOV if that info is published.\n\nThe biggest threat to WISH is not AMZN but BABA. AliExpress sells a lot of similar products, they own Cai Niao which is basically like the global version of Amazon warehouses on steroids. Their goal is to get the majority of packages delivered from the warehouse in China to your door in 72 hours. I have used both Wish and AliExpress recently, and AliExpress had gotten a lot faster, whereas my Wish producs never arrived and I had to apply for a refund.\n\nI am long both WISH and BABA, but WISH has a lot in the works (private label through Wish Select, free shipping through Wish Access, etc) which can make them competitive.
