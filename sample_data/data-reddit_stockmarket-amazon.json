  "Text": "b\"Earnings just came out, and it wasn't bad. In line with expectations. They made about $3b in profit. They obviously have a strong marketshare in cloud, and that isn't going anywhere any time soon. I can say this safely as a software dev. They could raise their prices 25% and I know that would not be enough to get the company I work for to switch to anything else. \\n\\nThat being said, a P/E of anything over 50x seems crazy to me. 250 would be for a smaller company, growing exponentially. What are people predicting about the future of Amazon that they should be worth so much? Their retail business is low margin, and that isn't changing any time soon. \\n\\nIs there some sort of expectation of exponential growth in profit? I just really don't get it. This seems crazy overvalued to me, and people just buy Amazon because it's a big name and that's it. As good as AWS is, there shouldn't be any prediction of wild growth. If anything they could lose a little bit of market share going forward. \\n\\nWhat\"",

     "Shows why P/E is often a poor metric. Amazon is continually spending. On R&D, content, and acquisitions. Hell, they spent nearly a billion dollars on their Lord of the Rings amazon prime show. They also acquired 6 companies in 2022. \n\nIf they just cut all that out, they would drop to a P/E of ~15. But their goal is to sacrifice short term profitability for long term market share. It\u2019s how they managed to grow revenue by 10% last year while other big tech like apple and google were in the low single digits. They\u2019re sitting on $70B cash, so they\u2019re adequately funded to be taking the occasional loss"

Will most household want to have such a device in their home?\n* For those who want that, will Alexa really be so superior to alternatives, such as those from Google and Apple?\n* Will Prime Video benefit more from AI than Netflix, Disney or anyone else in the streaming business?\n* It seems households will be spending less for consumers goods in the coming months, because of rising interest rates. How will that impact Amazon?\n* Will AWS growth remain as strong as is has been in the current economic context?\n* How well will Amazon compete with Alibaba in India?\n\nIf I had a positive answer for all the questions above, I would go ahead. If not, maybe I would wait to see if the stocks goes back in the 90-100$ range, or commit less money for a position on Amazon."

From my perspective, Amazon had the best safety culture of any company I worked for by far.  Their forklift safety, dock safety, and trailer yard safety were by far better than anyone I had worked for.  In a warehouse environment those are typically the things that will kill you.  The soft tissue or repetitive injuries are an outgrowth of the workpace and the philosophy that a manager\u2019s primary job is to keep work in front of their associates.  Most companies want machine paced, not self paced work.  Aside from automotive companies, Amazon is one of the few companies to truly excel at it.  But it comes at a cost.  They try to mitigate the risk, but those injuries will not go away until robotics replace stowers and pickers.  I don\u2019t think packing was as much an issue.  I also suspect their injury reporting is more complete than other companies.  Amazon as a tech company just had more resources to do things than the other companies I had worked for across other industries."

When it comes to cloud computing:  There are any number of AI services from security, chat bots, targeted advertising, etc that Amazon maybe paying another company to do for them that eventually they can do for themselves and continue to vertically integrate.    \n\n\nAmazon does a lot of things, it is going to continue to try to do more things, innovate and integrate them into its package of services."

Add a couple low-fee diversified ETFs if there are 1-2 fields you think might outperform if you need to scratch that itch. \n\nI was in a similar situation years ago, and I remember after I rebalanced into safer holdings the feeling that my finances were finally healthy and headed in the right direction waaaaaay outweighed the shitty feeling of taking a loss.\n\nEdit: typo"

If the answer is as shallow as, to sell it for more later, then you will always be guessing and hoping your guesses pan out. These stocks could tank, they could go to the moon. \n\nFor each stock I buy I have a buying statement that I save. I am buying X company because... That statement is my foundation for when and if I sell. I bought Intel at $32 on its way down, because I believe in the capex plan to increase domestic chip manufacturing and pivoting from competing with Nvidia and AMD to competing with Taiwan semiconductor. So, my foundation is no matter what the price does I'm in it until their pivot plan has a chance to succeed. I'll hold until a few years after all their new plants are built and reassess them then. \n\nThinking that way is so much less stressful than panicking over the action of the price from day to day, and wondering if I'm smart or dumb for buying/holding/selling."

And I stupid looked at the price and thought, damn, but AMD so expensive at 11$ such price was only during 2000 bubble.\n\nBut yea, it's all bs about \"what if\", should just focus on my portfolio.

When asked about the tweet, he told the American network in an interview that the advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike.\\n\\nHe said consumers should postpone buying big basket items that they have been eyeing for some time and big businesses should also go slow on acquisitions and capital expenditures because the US economy is likely to be in a recession \"very soon\".\\n\\nTake some risk off the table, Bezos told CNN.

Kind of mind boggling to think about it. \n\nAn idiot with an iPhone has infinitely more knowledge than say, Einstein. The possibilities and untapped value/potential waiting to be unlocked are endless. \n\n$3 trillion is preposterous but at the same time, it\u2019s hard for me to disagree. Haven\u2019t even talked about their other products or services. Not to mention the absurd amount of data at their disposal.

  "Text": "b\"Hey everyone,. \\n\\nI want to have a discussion on the impacts of these huge layoffs. I keep reading all these articles about how big companies are taking aggressive measures to cut operating cost in the post pandemic climate. First was Twitter, then Meta and now Amazon. It seems the common rhetoric is the CEO's expected the growth of the pandemic to continue but didn't account for it having opposite effects.\\n\\nI'm just wondering what does this mean for the overall state of the economy? This probably is not the last of the layoffs that we are going to see and what kind of repercussions they will have. Is this just a much needed part of an economy that expanded to quickly for its own good? Or will this bring on bigger problems in the near future? What is the role of large scale layoffs in terms of inflation? My best guess would be it's a deflationary event. If you guys want to read the Amazon layoff story ill link it here, [https://www.invest-with-the-best.com/post/the-layoffs-continue-as-e\"",

But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the companys share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?\\n\\nOne bright spot has been the companys increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivians future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% in'",

Simultaneously the EV market by now has way more players, including the ones who have been making cars for a 100 years. The low hanging fruit are gone, and despite what Tesla told people, they're not in software they're in automotive. Looking at any kind of lists of who sells most EVs, I don't see Rivian on them.\n\nBut you know, you never know..? Something for that risky part of your portfolio? In any case, I think that's why the momentum is gone at the moment."

If their run rate continues at only the same amount of sakes as their most recent quarter, they are trading at about 5.3 times their sales.\n\nTheir profitability may be held back by accounting tricks rather than actual cash burn... How much is depreciation annually on new factories, btw?  How much are they paying in stock options that count against the balance sheet but don't actually cost money?  \n\nI haven't researched them, but they are finally making progress.  Rivian's market cap may not be particularly overheated at this point.\n\nI saw one in Syracuse NY yesterday, my first sighting of a Rivian vehicle other than their website. Syracuse is not a hotbed of electric vehicles.\n\nTheir sales are 2.9% of Tesla's, their market cap is 1.9% of Tesla's... Other than Tesla fanboys buying stock because reasons, why is Tesla's valuation so much higher? If they correct and meet in the middle, Rivian will be worth 25% more than it's worth right now, with no material improvement in execution.  Rivian seems to be headed in the right direction.\n\nI'm thinking about buying in..."

A COVID outbreak at the facility has lead to a mass evacuation of personnel.  Video has appeared online for several days showing thousands of Foxconn workers walking along highways to return to their home towns.  They are not allowed on buses or trains because they are designated as \"close contacts\" under China's strict anti-pandemic health code system.  It is the largest industrial plant shut down in human history.  The impact on Apple will be enormous, but the financial news media does not seem to realize it yet."

     "> IT IS HARD not to be in awe of Amazon. It is one of history\u2019s greatest companies. Jeff Bezos nurtured the firm from the humble online bookshop he founded in 1994 into a tech juggernaut, selling everything from corn syrup to cloud computing, a future trillion-dollar industry that Amazon more or less invented (see chart 1). Today it is the world\u2019s fifth-most-valuable company, third-largest revenue generator and second-biggest private employer. Its warehouses, data centres, shops and offices cover an area almost the size of Manhattan. Consumers, competitors and politicians have been left to wonder if Amazon would take over the world. Or whether it would stop there\u2014it is investing heavily in Kuiper, a satellite-broadband venture.\n>\n> All the superlatives notwithstanding, it is equally hard not to recognise that Amazon finds itself in something of a funk. With a downturn on the cards in America, its biggest market, shoppers are tightening their purse strings and corporate IT departments are paring back cloud spending. Amazon\u2019s market value is down by around $1trn since its peak in mid-2021 (see chart 2), erasing all the gains of the covid-19 pandemic, when customers rushed to join its Prime subscription service and businesses were shifting their data to its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This month Amazon announced 18,000 white-collar lay-offs, amounting to 6% of its corporate workforce. When it reports fourth-quarter earnings on February 2nd its annual revenue growth may for the first time ever come in at single digits, down from 22% in 2021. In October the company warned it might make little or no profit in the last three months of 2022.\n>\n> Amazon\u2019s Icarus moment is not unique in big tech. All its fellow tech high-fliers have been hit as demand for their digital wares declines now that people are no longer locked down at home and postmen no longer bring pandemic-stimulus cheques from the government. But under Andy Jassy, the AWS chief who took over as CEO after Mr Bezos retired in July 2021, Amazon has expanded much more aggressively than Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft (see chart 3). This exuberance leaves the company in a tough spot as it contends with three big challenges: a sputtering retail business; decelerating cash engines of AWS and a newish advertising business; and growing competition. Can the understated Mr Jassy overcome them, and turn Amazon\u2019s sprawling empire into a dependably profitable business?\n> \n> To understand how Amazon found itself in its current predicament, go back to just before the pandemic. The firm was already planning a big expansion of its warehouse and logistics network. The aim was to offer one-day delivery for more products to more Prime members. When national lockdowns created a boom in online shopping, Amazon doubled down. In April 2020 Mr Bezos told investors: \u201cIf you\u2019re a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat, because we\u2019re not thinking small.\u201d\n> \n> Over the next two years Amazon doubled the size of its fulfilment network. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI, an advisory firm, calculates that Amazon added about 130m square feet (12m square metres, or nearly four Central Parks) to its global footprint in both 2020 and 2021. In those years Amazon\u2019s cumulative capital spending reached $100bn. No company anywhere in the world invested more in that period. Last year it may have invested another $60bn, again more than anyone else. Around half that sum went on warehouses and vehicles; most of the rest on AWS data centres. Amazon also increased its payroll to 1.6m, from 800,000 in 2019.\n> \n> In the first quarter of 2022 Amazon admitted that overhiring and overbuilding were each adding $2bn to its quarterly costs, relative to 2021. Pricier fuel and higher wages meant a further $2bn a quarter. In April 2022 workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted to unionise, and called for \u201cmore reasonable\u201d productivity targets and more pay. If Amazon agrees to the union\u2019s demands, the Staten Island warehouse alone could add $200m or so to annual operating costs, estimates Morgan Stanley, a bank. At the same time, retail sales slowed; in December American consumers spent 1.1% less than the month before. Amazon\u2019s retail losses are thus piling up. Mike Morton of SVB MoffettNathanson, a research firm, estimates that when you strip out profits from ads, annual operating losses from the retail division (plus devices, entertainment and other smaller units) amount to about $30bn.\n> \n> The ad operation itself is another point of concern. In the past few years it has gone from virtually non-existent to the world\u2019s fourth-biggest, with yearly revenues of $36bn. Its operating margins are reckoned to be around 30%, on a par with the industry\u2019s two giants, Alphabet and Meta. But profitability may be slipping. Amazon has reportedly splurged around $1bn for the rights to stream some American-football matches, and alongside them some ads\u2014a fortune compared with the cost of posting banners on its own website. At the same time, year-on-year growth in ad sales has slowed sharply, to 25% in the third quarter of 2022, from 53% the year before.\n> \n> Amazon\u2019s main cash engine, AWS, is also decelerating as business customers trim their digital budgets. Soaring energy prices, especially in Europe, made it much costlier to keep the power-hungry data centres whirring. What is more, AWS is particularly vulnerable to shrivelling orders from startups, which tend to favour it over rivals such as Microsoft Azure. As their venture-capitalist backers grow stingier amid the tech rout, the young tech firms are slashing their cloud spending. In October Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, admitted that AWS\u2019s annual sales growth had declined to around 25%, the slowest on record. The average remaining lifetime of AWS contracts also ticked down in the most recent quarter, suggesting that customers are signing fewer deals or shorter ones. Microsoft, the second-biggest cloud provider, said on January 24th that it expects sales growth at its cloud unit to decelerate by four or five percentage points this quarter.\n> \n> Another problem is stiffening competition. As covid pushed shoppers online, traditional retailers switched their focus to e-commerce. Walmart increased its last-mile-delivery capacity four-fold just since the start of 2022. Target, another legacy supermarket chain, has used its acquisition in 2017 of Shipt, an online-shopping platform, to spruce up its digital-sales channels. Between 2018 and 2021 six big conventional retailers, including Walmart and Target, increased their collective share of American e-commerce spending from 8% to 12%, according to SVB MoffettNathanson. In the same period Shopify, a Canadian firm which offers merchants tools to sell online, expanded its market share in America from 5% to 10%. It is investing heavily in its own fulfilment service, which it launched in 2019.\n> \n> Rivals are making their presence felt in Amazon\u2019s non-retail businesses, too. AWS\u2019s healthy first-mover lead in the cloud is being eaten away. Numbers from Synergy Research Group, a data provider, show that its global market share in the business has more or less stabilised at just over 30% in the past three years. Its two main domestic rivals, Microsoft and Alphabet, have more or less drawn level with it when taken together. In advertising, Apple has a small but growing operation and Microsoft is dipping its toe in the water, signing a deal last year to provide adverts for Netflix\u2019s new ad-supported streaming service.\n> \n> The combination of loss-making retail, slowing profit motors and growing competition is hammering Amazon\u2019s profitability. The firm\u2019s overall operating margin in the third quarter of 2022 was just 2%, the lowest since 2017. In the past four quarters Amazon lost $26bn in free cashflow (the money companies generate after deducting capital investments)."

  "Text": "b\" \\n\\n**Roku** and **Shopify** are two of Cathie Wood's favorite long-term holdings. The famed growth investor's flagship exchange-traded fund, the **Ark Innovation ETF**, holds Roku as its second-largest position (7.99% of its portfolio) and Shopify as its eighth-largest position (4.55%).\\n\\nBoth companies grew rapidly throughout the pandemic as consumers watched more streaming videos on Roku's devices and did more online shopping through Shopify-powered storefronts. But they both faced tough post-pandemic slowdowns as those tailwinds dissipated, and rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth stocks.\\n\\n That's why in 2022, Roku's stock plunged 82%, Shopify's stock fell 75%, and the Ark Innovation ETF shed 67% of its value. But since the beginning of 2023, shares of Roku and Shopify have both soared more than 70% as the Ark Innovation ETF rallied 36%. Does that rebound indicate it's finally safe to buy either stock again? \\n\\n#  Roku's post-pan\"",

This is some sort of derivative or something. Nobody can figure it out because data is being skewed and withheld (cftc). Our markets in absolute shambles right now regulatory wise/abuse wise.\n\n\nJust like the NYSE 'glitch' the other day at open. They left the dang Disaster Recovery system on. That's not a mistake. It's never happened. And suddenly, t-2 from Jan 20th Swaps rollover we get some insane market 'glitch'. If you were smart, you'd have bought options and banked instantly in all that stuff that tanked.\n\n\nAPs and MMs submit orders that are place on the opening bell the first second via a matching system which determines the opening price of stocks. Then of course they manipulate trades premarket on low volume to shake out weak investors.\n\n\nThey are even using the glitch as an excuse to stop the SEC from switching from Payment for Order Flow to the new Auctioning system in March.\n\n\nTLDR: certain market participant manipulating and using it against the sec decision to change PFOF in March.\n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/nyse-glitch-caught-up-in-fight-over-sec-rewrite-of-trading-rules"

The ability to trade anywhere via mobile likely increases investors\u2019 propensity to trade in comparison to online- or phone-based trading. These mobile investing apps frequently market themselves through elite sport, a marketing strategy first developed by the gambling industry [61]. This marketing often emphasizes that the apps have either low or zero explicit fees [60], and the apps themselves can contain constant notifications and gamification elements nudging investors toward more frequent trading [62]. These apps can even profit from charging zero explicit fees via a financial arrangement called \u201cpayment for order flow\u201d (Rooney & Fitzgerald, 2020) [63]. This extent to which financial trading apps do not clearly communicate the true cost of their use is similar to the ways gambling operators obfuscate mandated cost-of-play information on gambling products.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9105963/\n\nPlease invest only what you can afford to lose (I think of my individual stocks as \u2018play\u2019 money and only put in a few hundred at a time when I have spare money and know I want to gamble - I\u2019m fully salaried)."

Amazon is the extreme kind where it deploys extra capital back to lowering the price to benefit customers, investing in infrastructure to improve efficiency, and deploying to growth markets to gain scale. It doesn't pay dividends, it doesn't buy back shares.  \nThis is very clear from its income statement. It's loss-making in its DTC e-commerce business and yet makes handsome profits in its B2B cloud unit. The former is more sensitive to pricing and the latter is not so much.  \nIt's really a unique case study about modern entrepreneurship and capital allocation."

     "* Earnings: 28 cents per share\r\n* Revenue: $127.10 billion vs. $127.46 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates\r  \n\r  \nLike the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has had a rocky year so far as it confronts macroeconomic headwinds, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. Those challenges have coincided with a slowdown in Amazon\u2019s core retail business, as consumers returned to shopping in stores.\r  \n\r  \nUnder CEO Andy Jassy, who took the helm from founder Jeff Bezos in July 2021, Amazon has responded to rising expenses by aggressively cutting costs across numerous divisions in recent months. It shed warehouse space, halted some experimental projects, shuttered its telehealth service and froze hiring for corporate roles in its retail business.\r  \n\r  \nStill, analysts are expecting Amazon to report solid third-quarter results, thanks to easier comparisons with last year\u2019s numbers and a potential sales boost from its annual Prime Day discount event, which was held in July.\r  \n\r  \nRevenue growth is projected to come in at 15%, marking a return to double-digit expansion after three straight quarters of growth in the single digits.\r  \n\r  \nAnother bright spot could be Amazon\u2019s advertising unit, which has been more resilient compared to peers including Meta, Alphabet and Snap, whose ads businesses have gotten whacked due to the economic environment and Apple\u2019s iOS privacy changes last year.\r  \n\r  \nOn Tuesday, Alphabet missed expectations for the third quarter, and YouTube\u2019s ad revenue declined for the first time since Google started breaking out results for the streaming video unit. Facebook parent Meta stumbled again on Wednesday, issuing disappointing earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the fourth quarter.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBesides allocation to TikTok, budget shift to lower funnel activities is the consistent point of feedback in our conversations with marketers this quarter,\u201d said Rob Sanderson, a managing director at Loop Capital who recommends buying Amazon shares, in a recent note to clients. \u201cAmazon is the lowest on the funnel.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWall Street will also be paying close attention to Amazon\u2019s fourth-quarter guidance. The forecast could signal how much demand Amazon expects to see during the holiday shopping period. Analysts are already girding for a lackluster season, with online sales expected to grow just 2.5%, according to Adobe.\r  \n\r  \nEarlier this month, Amazon hosted a 48-hour Prime Early Access Sale, which was the first time it has held two major discount events in the same year. The event jump-started the holiday shopping period early, and it could help juice Amazon\u2019s sales in the fourth quarter. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv are projecting fourth-quarter revenue of $155.15 billion.\r  \n\r  \nAnalysts have taken different approaches to their per-share earnings estimates because of Amazon\u2019s hefty investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian, which went public late last year. The plunge in Rivian\u2019s share price forced Amazon to take a combined $11.5 billion markdown in the first two quarters of 2022. However, Rivian shares rebounded a bit in the third quarter, climbing 28%, which could lead Amazon to mark up the investment.\r  \n\r  \nAmazon shares have slid 34% so far this year, while the S&P 500 index has dropped 20% over the same period."

Q1 report will certainly show negative EPS for AMZN. So the prime hike won't even really be important by then.\n\nPrime content has been on a slide. Wheel of Time stunk.

I'm a Costco member and eventually, they will hike the price of Costco memberships as well. It's a given.\n\n$20 is about $1.50 monthly. Idk about you guys but I share my prime account with friends and family members. You just have to plan it right and share as many accounts as possible with those you trust. Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, Disney... I share all of it and pay probably $10 total per month for all of these services.\n\nIf you're really on a budget, their music+videos+photo storage+twitch games, etc., is good value rather than if you were to just be subscribed to Netflix. Content is lacking, sure, but it's still good value if you truly use it.\n\nAmazon has pretty much put a vacuum on the market to where most won't be turned off by this price increase. Those who cancel will probably just re-subscribe once they realize the alternative isn't really worth saving $20."

Remember that all the inflation in the country (government spending) is being hidden in the stock markets and crypto markets.  Most of that money never got into the people's hands, which is why we are not seeing a ton of inflation other than in the housing market, stock market and crypto market.  Money has to have a home.  I think they are going to hoard cash, wait for the market to crash, and then buy back everything on the cheap.  Of course you know is gonna get fucked and be worse off in this process.  The 401 ks, retirements account and retail.  In other words, citizens.  Of course $6.7 B is chump change compared to what Buffet has on hand."

Those moves should benefit the company over the long run because 2022 served as a sort of wake-up call: even tech behemoths arent invincible.\\n\\nHowever, when we look more closely at Amazons valuation relative to its history, it becomes clear that it may take some time for the bull thesis to play out.

     "They are both overvalued vs other retail companies, so I don't view either as a top investment choice right now.  Kroger is a much cheaper e-commerce play if you want to buy a US company investing in delivery and growing their e-commerce capabilities, such as by opening warehouses for online delivery in Florida (where they don't have any retail stores).  International e-commerce options like MercadoLibre are growing faster than Amazon, giving a chance to get in at an earlier stage in their lifecycle.  I'd also look at niche retailers, like sporting goods, that are getting into e-commerce such as Dicks Sporting Goods or Academy Sports.  It is much easier for these niche players to grow revenue by double digits, while Amazon's size is starting to slow down its ability to grow or succeed in new ventures."

  "Text": "b\"IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effecti\"",

They obviously saw it was a product selling well and decided they needed their cut of the market share. They\u2019ll do that for all products which do well and can have a factory made/bought for on the cheap in China.\n\nEdit: I should add Amazon aren\u2019t the only ones doing this but they seem to endorse it on their platform. Most sellers on Amazon now seek out hot products on the platform, then find a Chinese supplier and drop ship it at a premium. That\u2019s how Amazon has become flooded with junk, and at this point it\u2019s become a positive feedback loop too."

They take their best sellers and roll out amazon choice product. Which is product they make themselves or they help push for money.\n\nIt's really a no-brainer.

Google instead keep it optical and have mirrors that are physically moved to change connections.\n\nIt does need to be longer life connections as it takes almost a second to realign each time to switch the connection paths.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal.

We don\u2019t have the data or time to do individual stock investing.  It\u2019s a game where you are trying to outsmart other people who are smarter and have more time and experience than you.  So you are gambling to get lucky.   Diversify and play the long game.  It\u2019s the only thing that works for individual investors over the long term (unless you have insider info).  Don\u2019t try and time the market, but instead invest more during down periods to cost average down.  The market always trends up over long time horizon.  \n\nLastly, everybody thinks they are a genius when they are doing well, which is very common during bull markets (last 12-13years).  So most of the advice you\u2019ll get is from \u201ckids\u201d who haven\u2019t been through multiple cycles.  Those older people like myself have and know better.

I remember no one wanting to buy AAPL when it was selling for pre-adjusted 50 cents after Steve Jobs was fired, the company tanked and Bill Gates rescued AAPL from bankruptcy.\n\nBut when and if CVNA ever comes back, you will have plenty of time to get in on the rise back up.  There is no play in buying this now and waiting.  Consider it a \"value trap\" if you want, or look inside yourself and search your feelings and see if they aren't related to the fear of missing out or fear or regret of having missed out, both of which are FOMO.\n\nThere are way better opportunities and they are not that hard to find.\n\nKeep asking questions though and weigh the advice.  In the end though, you need to make your own mistakes and find your own way.\n\nOne of the best trading videos ever (hopefully allowed as link by mods) mentions DRYS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XafQHxHKak"

Here\u2019s my notes for Carvana I made the other day about this trade idea..\n- CVNA is down nearly 98% from its highs and roughly 40% the past few days. This is indicative of a fund liquidating their position.\n- It\u2019s possible that we will see other funds step in and be forced to liquidate their positions as well which would drive price lower.\n- Carvanas sales model I will likely be the way of the future for car sales.\n- If CVNA continues to fall the company will not survive and will either go bankrupt or will be bought.\n- When you factor in the massive decline in price plus the futuristic sales model CVNA will likely look attractive to a major car company such as Ford, Porsche or Volkswagen to acquire.\n- This type of scenario makes for an interesting potential long trade.\n- This is just a theory, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were to happen in the near future all things considered. If I\u2019m wrong I\u2019m wrong a little, if I\u2019m right I\u2019m right in a big way. To me, that risk v reward makes sense."

Among other things that weren't happening, auto titles were not being issued in anything close to a timely manner.  Carvana kept selling cars though, and then didn't give people the title to their new car for months.  Carvana also couldn't get temporary plates from the SOS in Illinois, so they gave people temp plates from other states.  Illinois responded by suspending their license to do business in the state.  \n\nI'm not sure they had a good business model anyway, but the State of Illinois locked them out for things that were really the state's problem.\n\nhttps://news.wttw.com/2022/08/01/carvana-back-hot-water-state-illinois-license-suspension-reinstated"

I was in California at the time and the vehicle was in Arizona (a 6 hour drive from them to me) - I was all set to get the vehicle the next day and they failed to deliver. After the delivery time past they marked it as \"delayed delivery\" with no explanation and the soonest delivery date was a week out. Okay, I can wait a week.  Come the day before delivery date and there's another delivery delay, and again without any context so I chat with them to figure out what is up and they tell me there's a mechanical problem that needs addressed I pressed and pressed to get what exactly was wrong but the support people don't have direct access to the people at the distribution center and can only email them so there was never any information given. At any rate, another week until the next delivery for what is likely a pretty simple repair - so at this point I'm getting pissed, but again I'm in not in a hurry. The day before my next delivery date, delayed again - more \"mechanical issues\" with no information and this time a 4 day delay in shipping.  At this point I'm growing impatient with them and I get them to call me and I scream at them for fucking around but really nothing I could do.  The day of the next shipping, delayed again with a month long delay because \"the bumper needs replaced\", which screams of \"the driver ripped the bumper off the car because he/she is incompetent\" - any other excuse is invalid as if they sent it in for \"mechanical problems\" and the bumper needed replaced, why not do it then?\n\nAt this point I was beyond done with Carvana, cancelled the order checked out CarMax and in 10 minutes found my car (2016 GMC Terrain with 60K miles) and 2 hours later I was at CarMax picking up my car.

Their Esports scene is huge. As of lately they are diversifying in different type of games. Making popular games such as Valorant, Team Fight Tactics. Even diving in the mobile gaming space creating the popular Wild Rift. Every game they produce seems to be made of gold. They are working on many other projects even making their own series on Netflix which is currently rated a 9 by 220k people. Now to the sad part. This company is owned by Tencent. It's pretty much owned by the Chinese state. No matter how much I think Riot Games will continue to produce quality content, I just can't touch a Chinese stock. It's a shame Microsoft or Amazon didn't pick this one up back in 2011.\"",

It's like making the TV channel responsible for the safety of the products shown in their commercials or newspapers  liable for anything that is sold in their classifieds and ads. Of course Amazon does more than just that, it also takes care of logistics, but still it would be far fetched to make them liable for the product itself. That's not how eCommerce works. The law suit isn't about products that didn't arrive or were different from the description, it's about faulty products."

Too much concentrated power within the business world is not good for the economy as a whole. I am not here to say stuff like eat the rich, but I think it's something to be cautions with a company of this size:\n\n1. I doubt that Amazon would fail any time soon, but if they decide to collapse for whatever reason (e.g. failed ventures, class-action lawsuits, government intervention, etc.), we'd be in a recession for years to come when the market struggles to fill what Amazon has been building over the years\n2. If Amazon doesn't fail and the government doesn't break it up, **theoretically speaking**, they will eventually take over every other sector of the economy and everyone suffers because there isn't any competition. There would be no economic growth, no innovation, no new IPOs and ventures that investors can take advantage of, etc. since there's no money left to be made. Of course, that's a hypothetical situation if Amazon takes over *everything,* but I doubt that would happen any time soon since he's not the only billionaire in the United States."

     "In the industry: it was a smart move after CVS bought the last huge insurance company. There wasn\u2019t any insurers left for Amazon to buy so whats the entry into the market? Cash paying customers. They took the Walmart model and went next level: all rebates (both generic rebates and brand rebates) they receive they\u2019re giving right to the customer (they\u2019ll make money on the warehouse markup and prime growth). No middleman of 3rd party warehouse, huge undercutting of pharmacy pricing, ever improving delivery performance, etc. It\u2019ll grab that market very quickly which is significant. The thing I\u2019m not understanding is the partnership with all these pharmacies..haven\u2019t figured out why they would work with amazon. Short term benefit to long term very bad impact in my opinion.  Maybe Amazon is talking to them about being a warehouse provider to them eventually (ie if there is one loser here it is McKesson). Pharmacies companies shedding capital etc invested in warehouse sector, similar to how all cell companies in areas rent from companies that solely put up towers.\n\nThe next phase is the one that will be very interesting and where the meat is: insurance companies and their massive customer base. Amazon will have to offer an insurance model of some kind, either an enhanced prime membership etc. With the integration in other pharmacy groups with both insurers and carriers, Amazon will not be getting those customers..., but their insurance prime might begin attracting companies to move their health plans over. \n\nIn my opinion there won\u2019t be many players left: amazon, walmart, and cvs/caremark. Walgreens may end up getting aligned with one of those. There will still be need for physical location but much reduced.\n\nThere will be a lot of pharmacists unemployed over next 5-15 years."

As a result, subscriber growth is expected to slow in Q1 2023.\\n* Revenue:Revenue is expected to grow in Q1 2023, but at a slower pace than in previous quarters.\\n* Earnings per share:Earnings per share are expected to grow in Q1 2023, but at a slower pace than revenue.\\n* Content spending:Netflix is spending more money on original content, which is driving up costs. Investors will be looking for signs that the company is able to generate enough revenue from its content to offset these costs.\\n* International expansion:Netflix is expanding its international business, but it is facing challenges in some markets.

Once you realize that and consider their current ratio without the inventory, they're under water and about to drown.\n\nTheir market cap is almost $8b and their total shareholder equity minus inventory is $300m. Perhaps they were talking because Amazon offered them a generous $4.3b.\n\nUnless somebody leaks the offer, there is no reason to even be sure that they were talking about a buyout, and not discounted inventory.\n\nPrediction: Tuesday/Wednesday will be a blood bath"

And yet, Amazon is going gangbusters to expand its network, opening new facilities all across the country with the aid of compliant cities and states and little recognition of Amazons devastating impact on local economies.\\n\\nIn North Andover, Mass., for instance, Amazon recently received $27 million in public funding to build a new warehouse. In Windsor, Conn., it was $8.8 million. The property taxes for a new Amazon distribution center in Glenwillow, Ohio, will be reduced by nearly half for 15 years. And the e-commerce giant is receiving taxpayer dollars for distribution facilities in Whiteland, Ind., and Arlington Heights, Ill., too.

     "Because politicians want to claim they created all these jobs at reelection time. They leave out all the corporate welfare taxpayers provided and jobs lost on Main Street. They'll talk about the local income tax revenue workers will pay but leave out the property tax lost, which in Ohio provides a large chunk of our school funds. Schools then hit up taxpayers to pass another levy to make up the difference. Cities will fall all over themselves to give the most away and you don't want to be the city that didn't give enough away and lost all those jobs. Personally, I'd be interested in reading an independent study that compares the benefits vs costs and if these corporations create all the jobs they promised to get this welfare."

If you have vacant land it is not generating any tax revenue, adding a new business there (even at a much reduced rate) can be a net positive for property tax revenues."

     "I am actually from Andover Ma and I can tell you North Andover before and after Amazon is not what many would have you believe. Let me preface this with the fact that I oppose monopolies and I am about as hardcore liberal as one can get but Amazon warehouses specifically are not the real issue. \n\nDue to politics and our wonderful capitalist's society competition is natural and needed for progress. The amount of technology that Amazon alone has created since January is unfathomable and almost all of this technology will positively impact some aspect of life. We need to transform our thinking to understand that not all big business is bad, just that politicians need to promote the little guy to force competition for the bigger guys.\n\n The problem with capitalism being controlled by politics is that politics is as much a competition as owning a business. Each city in the U.S. has to compete with it's own neighbors for federal funding, residency, and much more to provide the best services for its citizens and businesses. Unfortunately to be competitive nowadays you have to cut corners or go against ethics. This happens in the chicken industry where the quality of the chicken must be lowered to increase the usable meat when slaughtering them and lower the price of raising them. Politicians know that Amazon may affect local small businesses (many have not been able to compete for years so its not completely Amazons fault usually) but they want to provide better services and lower taxes to attract more residents(or just pay themselves more).  \n\nIts unfortunate but Amazon does make sense for almost all of us vs brick and mortar shopping. Its priced competitively for our benefit (for now) and consolidates a lot of manufacturing and retail allowing for more specialty businesses or more technology-based work and less minimum wage/unskilled labor. Many of our qualified high-skilled workers don't have enough job opportunities but every day my indeed is flooded with minimum-wage jobs.  We are a country filled with smart or at least brave people willing to do more than just the generic cashiering job for 11/hr. I think we need companies like amazon and google and fb to make way for more tech based work and work that our citizens deserve. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAndover has actually increased its employment AND its annual income per person. So we have more jobs and they are paying better on average. Clearly that still means some people could have been hurt and many businesses are now gone. But more businesses (and probably more successful) businesses will reopen in their spot with new ideas and innovations and services to better provide for the community. We just need to find a way to make CEOs and politicians want to give back to the community to help provide for the people that are helping them make all their money as well."

Despite the layoffs from tech giants like Dell, PayPal, Salesforce, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, a new study by Goldman Sachs suggests these companies are not representative of the broader economy. The common characteristics of these companies include being in the tech sector, hiring aggressively during the pandemic, and seeing sharper declines in stock prices. Economic bears continue to voice concern about the layoffs as a sign of a slowing economy, but Chief Economist Jan Hatzius believes it\\'s an overreach. Job gains for November and December 2022 were also revised higher, and the job finding rate among unemployed individuals has been high by historical standards.\\n Q: Are these layoffs a sign of a weakening US economy or just a result of tech companies restructuring?'",

Meta just announced $40billion while laying off ten\u2019s of thousands of employees, which could\u2019ve covered those employees salaries for over a decade.\n\nTech sector is heavily influenced by interest rates both when it comes to borrowing and valuations. With zero percent interest rates, you could theoritically valuate tech companies at anything (see Tesla). \n\nNow that interest rates are normalizing for the first time since the GFC these companies have to adapt their operating costs/business models to show that they are viable in the new economy while appeasing the capital markets. A lot of these companies like Meta, Netflix or Tesla aren\u2019t as fundamentally strong as they seem if interest rates were normalized. All three currently have intense competition chipping away at their market share and they\u2019re only dominant because of first mover advantage and access to capital markets.\n\nSo the change in interest rates is causing these companies to restructure their business. Other theories such as an upcoming recession, or an effort to depress rising wages are possible but less likely imo."

     "So many comments here don\u2019t understand what ESG is the the methodology used to develop the score and annual list. Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance aka ESG. Three prongs taken at equal weights. Most companies can get an easy score on the Social aspect but not always, same with Governance. Environment is different because the way it\u2019s calculated is kind of antiquated. \n\nThere\u2019s really two main parts to a company\u2019s score, the company\u2019s own response to S&P to about 100 or so questions and 500-1000 data points collected. Then take into account that S&P regularly changes the methodology for calculation as well. \n\n\nSome companies know how to answer the questions better than some, which is why they stay on the list. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s Tesla\u2019s issues, just pointing it out. We all know the oil and gas industry has some powerhouse PR as proven every time the have an oil spill. \n\n\nThe data points include things like social and environmental campaigns run by the companies. Like when Exxon says they\u2019re developing cleaner technologies to drill oil, we all know that it can never be clean but it\u2019s \u201ccleaner\u201d (take that with a big grain of salt) so they get good marks for it. We all know it\u2019s BS but we turn a blind eye because we need gas. \n\n\nI read Tesla had racial bias and sexual harassment claims, all companies do, but being a tech company in the Bay Area will generally lead to more than one in Houston. Not that Tesla has more, but from my wife and MIL\u2019s years in HR, people at tech companies feel more empowered to report compared to companies run by and with the \u201cgood ol boy\u201d culture. There\u2019s actually a big push in the oil & gas industry to change that, same for my industry - Supply chain & Logistics. \n\n\nSaying all that to say, this isn\u2019t blow back against Elon for the twitter deal or crap like that, these were calculated weeks/months ago.\n\n\nEdit: if you want to know more than some click bait articles you can read up about it here: [S&P methodolgy](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/products-benefits/products/esg-evaluation)"

It's always interesting to see that different company win and lose and there's no constant winner. In some years like 2000 and 2020, tech wins out. But for 2005 or 2010 energy firms stand out on top. Neither there is a constant sector winner. Apple and Aramco (tech and energy) are now the top 2 but I doubt that will be the case. In the next 5 years, 10 years or 15 years, what companies do you think will come to the top?"

     "This is literally your last chances get out of crypto before you see your money disappear.\n\nNever have so many Governments and banking heads around the world from China, UK, Europe, US identified crypto (especially Bitcoin) as an entity to be crushed.  They are literally telling you point blank that they are going to crush Crypto.  They have never worked together like this before.\n\nTheir reasons are clear,  the anonymous nature of transactions leads crypto to organized crime and simply makes it too easy to hide revenue from the Government.  All Governments are worried about loosing tax revenue as a result of cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThey are attacking crypto along several fronts.\n\n1) Regulation.  Bring crypto exchanges into the current regulatory environment.  To crypto idiots, this looks like the establishment is finally going to adopt crypto. What it really does is setup legal arguments for the shutdown of these exchanges.  Why? Because there isn\u2019t a crypto exchange on the planet that can meet organized crime regulations. They can\u2019t, because crypto can\u2019t be traced. \n\n2) the introduction of regulated crypto currency controlled by the central bank. This is competition, designed to remove any sort of public backlash from the imminent removal of crypto as any possibility as a currency of transaction, and pushes crypto to the fringes of use. It also reduces crypto to a single purpose, as an asset exchange between official currencies.  This removes any sort of demand for crypto by replacing it with something the establishment Iikes.  Once this is introduced, the closing of unregulated coins in exchanges will start.  This is where crypto exchanges will only be able to sell you those coins that meet organized crime regulation requirements.  Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum will ever meet those requirements. \n\n3) the new crypto does advance currency transactions.  The Feds new digital currency for instance has the capability to simply make credit cards obsolete.  That\u2019s quite a shift in the industry. It will make waves. The waves will be all about this new crypto coin and how amazing it is for online transactions that are no longer hemorrhaging revenue to credit companies. This is where Bitcoin and Ethereum should have been.. but they\u2019ll never be allowed to get there, Central bank heads have said this already, very explicitly.  \u201cBitcoin will never be used as a currency for transactions\u201d.  <=== Google this, and see who said it.   While stability is important, that\u2019s not the primary reason, although it\u2019s an often used excuse. The primary reason is about control.  Currency use has always been about control. \n\n\nCathy Wood, and Elon Musk are not in a position to influence policy around the world, and they are not large enough forces to overcome the establishment with respect to the use of currencies.  These are not the people who can protect your money if what I described comes to pass. \n\nIt\u2019s your money.  I just felt I had to warn you. Don\u2019t say the writing wasn\u2019t out there as literally every central bank has been telling people to stay away from Crypto due to regulations."

     "Seems like quite the battle. Walmart has old infrastructure (brick and mortar), and Amazon started later so they probably have more tech framework.\n\nFor example, Walmart doesn't seem to have extremely-fast dropshipping, so I hypothesize their online order to warehouse to shipping sequence is inferior to Amazons. I would further that conversation by asking, who do we think will be able to implement drone-based shipping sooner?\n\nHowever, it is a strength of sorts for Walmart to have stores in many if not most cities. I would test this strength by considering two main types of online purchases: common items such as Crest toothpaste, and esoteric items such as a 0.25\" derma-roller. Basically order an item that would exist locally in a Walmart store and one that wouldn't from their online store, and perform the same test at Amazon. Test which ones consistently ship faster. This should reveal some unseen infrastructure coefficients.\n\nAs an extension of that common vs. esoteric item test, an aggregate analysis is due for probing the implications of ordering online + shipping and ordering online + in-store pickup. Walmart crushes in this regard, but Amazon could potentially add store fronts in their warehouses and/or shipping facilities, so it will be important to track that if you maintain that Walmart has a comparative advantage.\n\nAs a Canadian, I find one drawback for Amazon is that, if an item ships from China, it's game over. It will take 2+ weeks, sometimes upwards of 2 months to arrive. Walmart doesn't seem to be as interested in these esoteric, low footprint items such as PCIe to 4 USB peripheral hardware for a computer.\n\nIn addition to this difference between common and esoteric items for Amazon and Walmart, I find that Amazon's reputation seems to be worse today because, as a company, they seem to be orders of magnitude more sociopathic than Walmart in the ways they treat employees as time-tracked cattle and have issues with lacking intent for cleaning up bot-riddled fake reviews and counterfeit/low-grade third world companies. Amazon is a network of third party sellers. Walmart is one seller that acquires products and then sells them.\n\nI would ask the question, what will the future bifurcation be between frequency of online purchases vs. in-store purchases? If Amazon can use their current infrastructure as item pickup touchpoints, that brings Amazon pretty analogous to Walmart in terms of physical location saturation (and related logic). Shipping velocity strikes me as the most important attribute. In my opinion, that seems to be a critical factor in quantity of demand, more so than brand reputation. Both companies have significant economies of scale. Walmart seems less infested with both endogenous and exogenous dark triad vectors.\n\nAnd of course, make sure a person studies \"dark shopping cart patterns\": [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07032.pdf) Both Amazon and Walmart seem to heavily deploy those grey area ethics techniques. At the moment, whoever is using more of those is probably capable of harnessing more sales if traffic is in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nAlso don't forget Nike's recent movement to push transactions from external sources to their domain. This is significant, in my opinion, because it implies potential aggregate movement from centralization to decentralization. It begs the question, what other brands might try this, and who exactly is going to handle shipping when shipping velocity composed with total cost is among the primary concerns. Maybe we will see more aggregator websites with outbound links to shopping carts? I wouldn't want to assert much specifics here in the way of solutions, but an Occam's Razor will be converged upon via regression to the mean as free market mutations iterate from here, now.\n\nAlso don't forget that Walmart's market cap is $417 Bil, and Amazon's market cap is $1.75 Tril. That's a difference by a factor of 3, almost 4. Amazon also owns data via AWS that relates to transactions on all websites and servers using their database stores, etc. In some ways, the limit of Amazons comparative advantage approaches disgustingly-great as the amount of compared metrics approaches infinity."

     "Just my opinion, as a millennial that loves both. I spend far far more money at Walmart. I would hazard to guess I spend 20x more there, especially in the grocery arena. I\u2019m betting on Walmart, it really makes perfect sense for them to go this route. Yes they aren\u2019t a tech company, but let\u2019s be honest Amazon\u2019s website isn\u2019t a super complicated model to follow. Amazon\u2019s tech is in AWS, not their website. Walmart has everything in place to make this happen, logistically speaking. They just need delivery drivers really. Personally I\u2019m shocked to see people betting against Walmart, they aren\u2019t the next sears. They\u2019re proving to investors their ability to adapt which I think is huge."

They have their hands in a million different pies. At some point, the government will likely step in and break them up. In that case Wal Mart could certainly start dominating in thia fight."

     "From RH Newsletter regarding Amazon's Ghost Grocery :\n\nThis could be Amazon\u2019s big grocery advantage...\u00a0over Instacart, Walmart, and DoorDash. E-grocery shoppers have to go\u00a0into\u00a0stores just like you and us to pick out your goodies before delivering them \u2014 that's not very efficient.\n\nSpeed:\u00a0All that pushing between shopping carts, little kids, and cheese-gawkers slows the process down. That doesn't happen in a Ghost Grocery.\n\nReliability:\u00a0In regular stores, there's a decent likelihood that the pesto you ordered is gone. In Ghost Groceries, supplies are closely monitored (and no one storms the pasta aisle).\n\nPrice:\u00a0This more efficient fulfillment method could allow Amazon to lower prices\u00a0or\u00a0rake in more profit."
