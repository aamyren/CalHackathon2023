     "Kind of besides the point, but what about dcaing into an etf is Buffett like? Buffett has always been invested in stocks. I don't understand the enthusiasm behind etfs on the internet. It's like there is a collective wisdom that the layperson can't pick stocks, so an etf is the smart way to mitigate risk. Meanwhile, if you've ever looked at the stock market, you know stocks are correlated and their gains, if you measure them, dwarf the etfs that hold them. Any high market stock is going to move with the market and these happen to be some of the most popular brands. It's easy to pick stocks. Like you picked Amazon, that falls under the umbrella of what I'm saying. What is more difficult is timing the market and I think your question is really a timing the market question. In my opinion we are at a decision point for the market. Has it put in a low and will it continue upwards? Or will it recede to its lows and put in new ones? These conditions don't really fall into the criteria of any of any of my strategies, except selling naked options, which I don't do anymore. Maybe it's best to hold your money and wait for something more obvious?"

I\u2019m looking at this price point so I can buy 100 shares at a time and sell covered calls on the stock I own. \n\nOne that I have right now is Ford stock. Currently $13.08/share and pays a 4.78% dividend. So I\u2019m collecting dividends and options premium from covered calls. \n\nAnother one I am looking at buying is AT&T. Currently $18.86/share and pays a 5.95% dividend. This week I sold a cash secure put that expired worthless, so I got a very small premium and didn\u2019t touch the stock. I\u2019ll sell another cash secure put this week and see if I pick up. Once I do, I\u2019ll be selling a covered call with roughly 30-45 days till expiration. \n\nAnother stock I love is GDV, and this is the exception to my rule. You cannot sell options on this, but it pays a 6.18% dividend that is paid out monthly. Currently I have this DRIP to buy more of the stock, so when I retire this nest egg will provide me with a nice monthly dividend that I can live on.\n\nI look at each of these stocks as resources that I can use to bargain with and leverage for premium. \n\nI also will run the wheel on stocks, especially if I want to keep that particular stock in my portfolio. \n\nTLDR; find cheaper stocks so you can diversify your portfolio."

I\u2019m watching for a run up to write a 4/21 contract and roll my other contract.  \n\nAlso check out call open interest to see what expectation is \u2026and also watch the daily call volume \u2026and remember Amzn earnings coming next month \u2026might see a run up.  I use Barchart and the Barchart app. \n\nI bought Amzn pre split for $120 and sold for $150 last year and have been waiting since then to jump back in.  I sold CSPs 4/21 $90 a few months ago thinking I might get assigned to no avail so I just decided to buy the stock \u2026but received some nice premium on the puts.  Maybe sell some puts when the stock takes a dip to receive some more premium and lower your CB.  \n\nPut call ratio for 4/21 is .48 and the trend is up. I agree with others to sell a call or 2 (after a run up\u2026even if it\u2019s only to $102) then wait and see.  Pay attention to a possible pre earnings run up.  I\u2019d choose .25 delta or lower in case there\u2019s a good run up and you have to chase the call."

You scaled into Amzn w/avg price of $159 now, your bias feels slightly bullish or were you trying to avg lower hoping for bounce to exit @ breakeven? After U figured out your bias lean (bull or bear) and w/$100K + position in a single instrument do the homework (TA). This will determine how aggressive & directionality of your approach towards the options trade.

However, this week sees the FOMC decision on Wednesday, Non-farm payrolls on Friday and a slew of big-cap tech earnings. All of which could be market-moving. SPY options for the week are pricing about a 2% move, and obviously, with reports from Apple, Amazon, and more, QQQ options are pricing a larger move, nearly 3%. As mentioned here over the past few weeks, traders need to be aware of the overall vol environment as that can set up for underpriced options in names that see earnings misses. The same may be true for economic releases as in recent months a more typical SPY expected move for an FOMC (or CPI in mid-Feb) wou'",

     "A few things that may help.\n\n1) A diagonal spread (aka pmcc) can profit from the stock moving up slowly while selling and closing short calls, or if the stock \"shot up\" as the LEAPS call will gain value so both legs of the trade can be closed for any over all profit.  Look at the math, but if the trade was opened properly you can just close it up and go open a new one.  \n\n2) If you roll the short leg for a net credit then you are ahead and should have a profit if closed at some point in the future, even if rolling books a loss when traded.  Look at the entire position transaction and not just the roll trade.  \n\n3) Many set an order to close for a 50% profit to capture it and then open a new short call trade to keep things going.  If the stock has moved up too much then closing both legs should offer a net profit so may be better than rolling (see #1 above)."

No point in having a long leap if your short position is crimping you . \n\nAlso when you roll you are closing your current position , forcing you to sacrifice premium . \n\nIn my honest opinion , you aren\u2019t experienced enough to be playing with PMCC\u2019s. One day you will get caught in a snare , your short position will gobble up premium plus , and force you to cough up shares that cost more than your longs are worth - a lot more-  which is why a diagonal might offer more protection against a theta induced IV crush . You could very easily find yourself in a short squeeze if something skyrocketed on a binary event , a surprise announcement etc"

You\u2019ve made 16, meaning you have 219 to go with about 40dte as of Monday before breaking even.  That\u2019ll happen one of two ways.  One is a sharp move toward the strike since you\u2019re already close, but sharper than today\u2019s. The other is for the value of a share to exceed 112.35 before expiration at which point you STC, get your paid premium back as well as anything exceeding that.\n\nEdit:  Although I\u2019m rarely a long option player at all, your better move may be the more distant strike with a less expensive premium and good volatility.  For example, -AMZN221223C130 & 135 will open Monday at around .35 & .23 respectively.  Sharp moves toward those strikes are much more likely to exceed the premium and produce some profit early than being close and nearly requiring the strike plus the premium at expiration.  You\u2019d then STC early, take the smaller prize, and move on to the next."

AFAIK, very few (if any) retail traders do this. AFAIK, \"replication\" is esoteric black magic reserved for the bigger players on trading desks within banking institutions or hedge funds.\\n\\nAFAIK, the vast majority (if not all) retailers just create a suitable risk profile with only options (iron condor, credit spread, etc.). They stay in options only and don\\'t bother to \"replicate\" anything by trading the underlying.\\n\\nIf I\\'m wrong, I\\'d like to learn about it.'",

     "The first thing I would say is that the Taleb book is for market makers, by a market maker. Additionally, a fair amount of time is spent discussing hedging exotic options retail will never encounter in practice, such as binary and barrier, and it can be hard to figure out in the text what is actually applicable for retail.\n\nA better handling of the issues and techniques for retail dynamic hedging is in Sinclair's *Volatility Trading*, and an explanation for why retail shouldn't bother is in his *Positional Option Trading*. For a good handling of what market makers do and have to deal with, his *Option Trading* has a great chapter on that.\n\nRather than duplicate it here, I'll refer to a recent reply I made on this subject:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/12j0n2y/comment/jfwn2ed](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/12j0n2y/comment/jfwn2ed)  \n\n\nFinally, I would recommend watching u/esInvests interview with Euan Sinclair here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDA449Fkwj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDA449Fkwj4)\n\nIn here Sinclair explains that it's often best for retail just to manage risk with position sizing."

Weekly IV was higher for the week to account for the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday, the Jobs number, and earnings reports from the likes of Apple, Alphabet Amazon and more. The majority of the market volatility occurred into and out of the FOMC event. So despite the final tally being less than what options were pricing the week featured a 4.5% rally from the lows of the week to the highs.\\n\\nThe QQQ was where the majority of the action was, finishing higher by about 3.4% on the week (versus a 2.8% expected move). The VIX was down slightly to 18.30, the lowest it has been in the past year. The next bit of a pop in IV this month is around the 14th for the next CPI where SPY IV pops from 14 to 17 (as seen on the expected move chart below). However, the CPI is becoming less of a market-moving event (in the eyes of option vol, as 17 IV is not high at all compared to recent months). I'",

     "What\u2019s the current *market* IV gap between two identical ATM calls w except where one is 5/1 and the other is 5/8?\n\nKeep in mind market price drives IV not the other way around. Think about it: implied vol means the volatility *implied* by a given market price for the option. \n\nAlso....I don\u2019t follow AMZN but consider that expectations are through the roof for them. If they post a blowout quarter....the stock may be flattish. And if they give even slightly squishy outlook, lookout below. AMZN is a \u2018safety stock\u2019 right now - a lot of people are in it as a hiding spot and if AMZN proves not to be a hiding spot then they all leave. \n\nDo what you want to do, I\u2019m not making a rec at all, but 1) fundamentals matter, and 2) \u2018whisper\u2019/expectations matter more."

     "I like this strategy. I have employed a similar strategy many times, quite profitably.\n\nThere are a few things I would adjust in your strategy:\n\n* Given that AMZN earnings are on Apr 30th, you still have several days for the stock to move, and also a few days for volatility to go up. So, I would increase your short call to a higher strike.\n* Secondly, as IV goes up, you will benefit from vega. As the stock goes up, you will benefit from delta. As time goes on, you \\*should\\* benefit from theta, but you will not, as the vega move will outweigh the theta benefit.\n* Next, your cost calculation: you said this spread costs you $118. But you did not include the hidden cost of the margin \\[which will be $4000 in your example, because of (2540-2500)\\*100\\]. So your actual cost is $4118.\n* I would, instead, do a true calendar spread, for example BUY 5/8 2500 Call and SELL 5/1 2500 Call. This would cost you $1375 (because no margin). The dollar returns will be similar, on much lower capital at risk. ... \\[or pick a higher strike, based on my previous point\\]\n* Finally, the earnings announcement will be after the market closes. So, on the final day, BEFORE the market closes, I would close out the entire position, since the IV crush is going to kill you. I would then replace this diagonal spread with an iron condor, also expiring on 5/8.\n* And then, close out the Iron Condor on the day after earnings.\n\net voila!\n\nHope this helps."

     "First lets talk about why you want to make a change at all. A perfectly sound strategy would be to just continue to hold, or DCA and buy more shares at discounted prices, and wait another 10 years for things to average out. I'm not saying you have to do that, but I am asking why you decided not to. What has changed? Why do you think a pivot is necessary?\n\nThose aren't rhetorical questions. The answers are important to understand what the root cause is. Crafting a strategy without understanding what is motivating it is a recipe for making a bad decision/strategy.\n\n-------------------\n\nFor the sake of argument, I'll assume the reason is that you have discovered and gone beyond your risk tolerance. If that's not the reason, ignore the rest of this section.\n\nThe best thing to do, all things considered, is to rebalance your portfolio to lower its risk profile. That necessarily means selling some of your shares. You can tax manage that somewhat if you can select tax lots individually, but one way or the other, you are going to realize gains/losses and have tax impacts. However, I think you will find that the net net of all those tax impacts will cost you less in the long run than any kind of adventure into options and hedging.\n\nYou don't have to sell all your shares all at once. You can do a gradual reduction of risk by diversifying. And you can sell some of the losers to cancel out some gains on sales of the winners. You should probably dump all the losers regardless to free up capital for diversification.\n\nNow, how to diversify. That depends a lot on your time horizon and investment goals, but the general idea is to move your overweight in Tech towards the broader world-wide equity market, and add bonds and commodities to dilute the concentration of risk correlation in your current portfolio. 60/40 world equities/world bonds is a decent eventual asset mix to shoot for, but use an interactive asset mix calculator to find the mix that fits your goals best. I link a few below and the first link is the one I use myself.\n\nFor now, you can start slow by selling all your losers and however much of your winners net to zero cap gains after selling the losers, and use the freed up cash to buy VTI. That's only the US equity market, but it's a good place to start. If you want to go 60/40 VTI/BND, that would be fine too. Both are deeply discounted vs. 15 year averages right now, so you'll be getting bargain prices.\n\nYou can read more about asset class diversification and portfolio asset mix here:\n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio\n\nAsset allocation calculators:\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation\n\nhttps://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculator\n\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/overview"

Tax loss harvesting\n\n2.) Use correlations to your advantage. For example, DXY and rates going up clobbers tech, so positions that profit in such an environment are a hedge against your current PF.\n\n3.) Short correlated indices using futures or ETFs. SQQQ, SARK,NOPE on the long side or short QQQ, ARKK, GK directly and use the cash to buy short term Tbills.\nTheres an \"Inverse Cramer\" ETF coming online next month.\n\n\nFortunately tech pays shit dividends so its a lot easier to short it and short term rates are high so you have some structural advantage here that we didnt have for a long time.\n\n\nSo step one would be harvest as much tax loss as you can and figure out how much gains you can net out.

NONE of these will teach you trading, although you really should read Natenberg (figure 9 months, then reread once a year). McMillian... one step above trade.\n\nTasty has the best stuff. They SELL options, they do not try and figure out the next market move, and when they do are often wrong and say so in advance. There motto NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING, at least on future moves. If that is not the way you want to go , then listen to all the guys on these Reddits, buying an option for a $1, and cashing out for 10k.\n\nIf you want to try Tasty , sign up , besides the courses, listen to some stuff daily it is all recorded on their site, and some on youtube. The book on their site pushes their outlook selling strangles or Puts. It is the closest thing to a book that teaches trading.\n\nIf you are going to trade then get a trading app NOT ROBINHOOD.

It is deep enough  and starts with simple forward contracts, like buying a land, before delving into options. Reading the book twice or three times (and preferably doing the exercise book successfully) will give you such knowledge, that you will shake your head at the simplistic, inflexible and sometimes  dangerous tastytrade strategies/videos and their cherry-picked and incomplete \"market measure\" studies as well as their terrible risk management and one-sided trading tips. Been there, done that. Options are hard.\n\nGetting back to your question, if you REALLY and I mean REALLY wanna delve deep into the fundamentals of options, you need to read \"Options, futures and other derivatives\" by J.C. Hull and do the exercises. You need to have good mathematics knowledge for some parts. Calculus, Statistics, etc. It is college textbook and the Bible for quantitative derivative trading. It's almost as thick as McMillan's (which is obviously also great). McMillan goes into more detail than Natenberg and discusses trades management more than Natenberg, but doesn't have much math in it. Sinclair, as someone also mentioned is another good source.\n\nGood luck"

If the underlying price goes up on anything above 7-10dte, the option is going to offer you some money to leave.  A radical rise allows you to leave and keep a big chunk of the premium.  Whatever the BTC let\u2019s you keep, figure out how many shares that\u2019ll get you at the original intended strike price when subtracted from the new underlying price, 5 shares, 15 shares, whatever, and buy them.  Then you look at the underlying again, evaluate, and either sell another put with a higher strike or wait a bit for it to settle back into the zone it\u2019s found comfortable."

     "I\u2019m currently in a similar situation. I\u2019ll describe my situation and allow you or others to take what you will from it (probably nothing) \nAnyways, I own 1800 shares of WBD at $14 and Im confident I\u2019ll look back wishing I had bought more. Problem is that I\u2019m down to my last 5k cash avail. I decided I want to wheel options until I feel the stock is ready to breakout in an upward trend at which point I\u2019d use the earnings to outright buy the stock\u2026.so I decided to sell 4 of the 11.5 put options with 30-45 days til expiry. \n\nThis is my first time selling puts. I\u2019m very bullish on this stock so I was scared to employ a new strategy initially. I\u2019m glad I did though because I\u2019m learning a lot. Just 2 hours later I saw an article in the news tab announcing there was unusual options activity. Someone sold $5,294,036 worth of puts. I took a screenshot of the article and sent it to my dad cause it was reassuring to know I wasn\u2019t alone in deploying this strategy. I had told him what I wanted to do with the put selling weeks before all this happened and how I was just scared to try it even though I understood everything. I played the what if I lose all my shit and then some because I misunderstood the risk or premise of the strategy itself. Like I could\u2019ve bought straight shares like my dad did and now I have a tiny bit of fear about it. \n\nMy dad only has one strategy, buy low and sell high and it\u2019s gotten us in some sticky situations so I\u2019m constantly looking for ways to mitigate risk and one up him. \n\nHope my though process can show that you\u2019re not alone in that fear and what if crap. I think it really comes down to the timeframe and how badly you want to own the stock. \nIf you think this is advice then don\u2019t take it cause it wasn\u2019t. Simply laying out some discussion material about my thoughts when I do the same thing.\n\nEdit: this is basically me venting"

In short, Id love to figure out how folks would use options as stocks are hitting lows such as Amazon (AMZN) and what your strategies would be.\\n\\nI realize again, noob question and has endless possibilities, but my overall thoughts:\\n1. I dont know where the market is heading, but Im bullish on AMZN.\\n2. Would it be simply a long call option strategy (dare I say, try and time the market or AMZN when it rebounds?)\\n3. Find an ideal exit price and take the profits.\\n4. This could be continuously buying long calls and ride the wave (hopefully).\\n5. Im sure others would call out, but wheres the risk management?! I guess some sort of stop loss or a different strategy.\\n\\nI hope people have fun with this or have some resources that you could point everyone towards. Thanks Im advance!'",

     "Dude forget options, just buy shares and thank me 30 years from now. \n\nYou have what is likely a once in a lifetime chance to own Amazon at these prices. \n\nThis is a company that outside of recessionary conditions is making $25 BILLION a year in net income, expected to do $500 billion in revenue this year and $560 billion next year AND STILL PROJECTED TO CONTINUE GROWING at an incredible clip. \n\nYou\u2019re paying about $900 billion for a company that has the best e-commerce, and cloud opportunity of any company in the world going into the future and is already the undisputed king in these sectors. MOAT? Think of what it would take for a competitor to come in and compete with them, the billions in infrastructure and talent required, there is no one even close to the level of market dominance that Amazon already has and no one with enough money to even put up meaningful resistance.\n\n$911 billion for a company with $186 billion in assets, and $19 billion in cash, which means you\u2019re really paying about $700 billion for the undisputed king of e commerce.\n\nThink ahead into the future, do you think online shopping will become bigger or smaller? Cloud/web services? I doubt brick and mortar retail will stage a meaningful comeback any time soon. Amazons total addressable market is expanding every year AND their share of that market is still expanding.\n\nThey\u2019re in so many different businesses already, streaming media, e-commerce, advertising, groceries, cloud computing, the list goes on and in, soon to be gaming, hardware, software, services, delivery/logistics etc..\n\nThis is a company that is competing with, and winning against, companies like Netflix, Disney, Microsoft, Shopify, google, Facebook, Apple, Nvidia, Walmart\u2026 \n\nThey\u2019re slowly taking over the world one sector at a time and you have 1 shot to get in at these prices.\n\nOptions will give you crumbs, you should seriously consider shares and get the whole cake.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if after this recession amazon goes on a decade long bull rally and ends up somewhere near $5 or $6 trillion. 30 years from now they could be paying quarterly dividends HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PRICE OER SHARE. \n\nDon\u2019t mean to write a whole novel but companies like Apple and Amazon are in a whole league of their own, with the advantage going to Amazon in my opinion. It\u2019s a company that\u2019s designed to take over nearly every sector in the worldwide economy, while apple is limited to hardware, software, and services.\n\nThey will introduce all sorts of whacky shit that no one is even thinking of right now. Imagine putting Fedex and UPS out of business because they get so good at automated drone delivery that sending an item through the mail costs 10x as much.\n\nImagine a 90% reduction in google shopping searches because it\u2019s easier, cheaper, and better to just buy everything from Amazon instead of shopping at individual websites. Imagine instead of companies building websites to sell products, they list it on Amazon instead. Imagine amazon acquiring Netflix and Disney and integrating all streaming media into one amazon prime membership instead of people having accounts with 5 different services. Imagine shopify going out of business because it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a e-commerce website any more. Imagine every 99% of the western world having an Amazon prime membership because they have expanded and dominated all the other countries out there. Imagine no one hosting their own servers, and businesses not having any computer hardware anymore because it\u2019s better do just cloud compute with AWS.\n\n20 years ago the bulls were saying imagine shopping malls closing down because e-commerce is better, it\u2019s already happening and the rate is increasing.\n\nJust crazy to think of what this company is going to be doing in 39 years, all the different lies they will have their finger in, the truckloads of money they will make for their shareholders.\n\nShares dude. Don\u2019t settle for a few thousand bucks today  when you can have hundreds of thousands or even millions down the road simply by exercising a little patience and taking ownership in something."

     "I am bullish on AMZN.  I currently have one short put contract on $86 strike with expiration of 16DEC22.  It's a wheel strategy; I want to own AMZN at these levels for a long term hold.\n\nI have also hedged this position with a long put spread on $87/$88 strikes on the same expiration.  All of these positions result in net credit of $0.22.  It would have been greater but I didn't apply the hedge until 2 days later.\n\nI arrived at this position due to the oversold signals from RSI.  I would eventually do the reverse of these options once they show overbought signals in a few weeks or months.  If it takes longer, then I am comfortable holding AMZN in my portfolio.  It's a profitable company and it's name is just about as ubiquitous as \"Gillette\" is to the razor market.\n\nI hope this helps you come to a decision on the trade.  Good luck."

Sure, at some point it\u2019ll go up, but what if it tanked more then recovered slowly over a year?  You\u2019d have your capital tied up and then with time decay, you probably wouldn\u2019t make a killing in that case. You have to decide upside vs. lost potential. What can you make with that money otherwise? If you planned on buying something and holding a year, then you could go in smaller and see, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d make a killing unless the market reversed and took off. Not saying you\u2019re wrong; just saying that people have waited for a reversal for two years and lost a lot of money, and they market is still squeezing out brick after brick."

AMZN had amazing numbers while the economy was hot, so these will make tough comps to beat for at least several quarters . . .\n\nThe stock is down considerably, so some of the above may already be priced in, and since you are bullish, it might make sense to sell puts if you are good with holding the shares if assigned.  Selling 42 dte around the .30 delta could bring in about $2.50 at the 83 strike and a net stock cost of $80.50 if assigned.  The Trefis estimate still shows a $160+ valuation, so this still seems cheap in the big picture.  \n\nThese puts could be rolled to lower that NSC even more before being assigned and might avoid assignment altogether.  \n\nIf assigned then selling covered calls at or above the NSC can keep bringing in premiums and lowering the stock cost more and more.  This is called the wheel strategy and is popular when you have a stock you don't mind owning.  \n\nIMO long calls are more of a gamble as you will not make anything if the stock stays sideways or doesn't move up enough as IV dropping and theta decay eat away the value . . ."

     "Your original post says you have the Amazon put as cash secured. This means you have enough cash as collateral to buy the shares if assigned. However, you also mentioned it is in margin. So I'll also answer this too, under the assumption you have your terminology wrong.\n\nThe buying power requirements for a short put (on margin) is similar to buying the shares at the strike price (on margin). You won't lose buying power on assignment, but you will lose buying power due to the value of the shares dropping. All assets have something called a loan value and margin value. The loan value drops as the market value of the shares drop, thus increasing how much buying power is being used. To remain solvent in the eyes of your broker, you must maintain positive buying power.\n\nThis is generally speaking and you should speak to your broker to see if they do have different margin requirements for short puts and long shares."

     "\"could be\" doesn't mean \"will be\".  \n\nDo yourself a favour and look back at past corrections/crashes.  A good place to start is SPX in May 2001, which exhibited similar price action to what we are seeing right now.  Back then, following a 30% decline over about 6 months, SPX broke the 100d SMA and touched the 200d SMA after rallying 22% off the \"bottom\".  Sounds familiar, right?  \n\nAfter touching the 200d SMA, SPX then pulled back just like SPX did this week.  If you were trading then, you might have thought it was just a little pullback, it'll come back up next week.  Sure enough, it did come back up a little for a few days allowing plenty of punters to buy up all of the inventory that the big money was trying to sell, but that was as far as it got before SPX fell a further 40% over the next year.\n\nThat doesn't mean the same thing will happen now, but you could have been fooled back in May 2001 just as easily as you could have been fooled in March 2002, May 2008, June 2010, Oct 2011, Dec 2015, Nov 2018, or possibly now."

I think you might see some weird things like higher strike calls worth more than lower strikes calls or your spreads showing more than the maximum loss/gain, etc. No worries though as all will correct Monday once MM have to tighten their bid/offers Monday morning. This might not affect everyone but I already saw like 2-3 comments in the other sub about this issue so just wanted to give a heads up to people here and to not worry if you had some huge PNL move right at 4. \\n\\nPlease note Im NOT saying a call shouldnt have lost value since Amazon went down. Im saying it should have lost value obviously due to delta, but despite this, the end of day marking of these options is still not correct and would violate a lot of optio'",

Does Amazon and many other large companies hope that they get the ability stay open when everyone else has to close?  Sure, but it is not legal to do this unless we are in an extended situation and only if the US Government takes possession of Amazons services until the crisis is over.

Its a doubly bad nightmare when the options are illiquid and the bid-ask is wide.\n\nAfter trading every kind of option for a long time, i tend to just keep it simple and do some index portfolio overwriting. Maybe a far OTM call lotto ticket here and there (rarely)."

Of course it's possible FB keeps dumping and is the catalyst for the next leg down in whatever the market is doing overall... but it's also possible it rebounds to 280 or something. Your lotto tickets hit, but if you hold you run the risk of having that $$ destroyed by all the fun that comes with 0-1dte.\n\nEdit: opening share price of 245 lead to ~19, 15 of which would be intrinsic.

     "I've been trading options for a while and learning my limits to better refine my strategy.\n\nSo now I thought about using this strategy, a more conservative approach to long calls:\n\n1. Always set a limit order for 50% profit. If I feel like selling before that's ok. The rationale here is because all the time I pick my contracts, I saw it going really well, some over 200%, but I got greedy and I couldn't take any of these profits.\n2. Only buy calls to companies I see growth for over the past 10 years. My favorite picks right now are SPY (mainly), MSFT, and APPL. (We can't predict the future with the past but it is still a good reference - I will always keep reading the news and earnings to stop with a specific company if I feel like to)\n3. Only buy slightly OTM contracts, preferably ATM.\n4. Only get into contracts with more than 6 months to expiration, so if a bear market happens right away I still have time to recover.\n\nI know this strategy has flaws like not having a stop loss, this is something I want to refine after by observing how it is going, but does someone know if there is any known strategy that looks like this so I can read more?"

If both calls are OTM, I lose my $121 buy in.\n3. If price is between strikes, I can be between $121 loss and $379 gain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had an opportunity earlier today to close out the position, recoup the $121 premium and profit an extra $50. I am bullish on the underlying stock and believe strike price will be above both prices near expiration as it will be a few weeks after earnings report and there have been recent positive events.  \n\n\nMy long term intention is to sell 6-month to 1-year calls at strike prices well above my cost basis and invest the premiums into SPY.   \n\n\nBased on that, would you bail on your position as soon as it is profitable, wait until you are closer to the expiration date, or white knuckle it until expiration day?"

However, the delta on that was usually around a .6, meaning there's much more risk and it's slightly better than a coin toss.\r  \n\r  \nSo am I better off doing a .80 Delta LEAP strike for risk rather than ATM for better historical returns?\r  \n\r  \nTo give you an idea, on SPY for 2 years, I got the following results.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/5dvaKIg.png\r  \n\r  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/a1h1xqB.png\r  \n\r  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/uwOnmpA.png\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nYou can see in each of them, the ATM call was the better historical return by FAR.

     "TL;DR: How would YOU defend a position if a 'black swan' event caused a major drop in value?\n\nI've reverted to paper trading as my theta strategies all got blown up last month, so I reset my account and am trying to learn before I jump back in. So, for this example, I really would like to know \"what you would do\" in this situation. Rest assured, no insight can/will be taken as financial advise as it's all theoretical.\n\n\\- Last month in my PT account, I bought a 1/20/23@170 PYPL call for $41.10 (current cost basis is 24.94) with the goal of running diagonal calendar spreads, lowering my cost basis, and eventually getting assigned by selling an ITM when such a move was appropriate (again, this is for educational purposes. I realize that normally I'd just want to sell the contract).\n\n\\- Current value is $9.75 on an apparently massive ER miss (guidance was pessimistic). I went over some 3rd party analysis and while I feel that the concerns are overblown, the fact of the matter is I'm down 80% so for the experiment I am proceeding as if my original thesis IS wrong.\n\n\\- With this much time left, I feel that the best option is NOT to cut my losses as I'm throwing away roughly 90% of the theta I paid for. That being said, what would be the best move to make at this point? Another diagonal calendar spread at this range is obviously picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, but if I keep lowering my cost basis I could perhaps reach B/E sooner and sell the contract/exit the position (again, I consider the play a failure as market sentiment has proven that my thesis was incorrect) on some positive price action. Also, I do have a good amount of time to roll out, but my runway is finite so the fear is pinning myself into an assignment at a loss.\n\n\\- My first thought was just doing [the repair strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/repair-strategy.asp), but given the market reaction, this could easily just be throwing money at bad money."

This morning it is $84 (net liq) to close it (see bottom img).\n\nI opened the trade with the euro around 1.40 and as you can see it has gone up to 1.44 since, but the debit to close has dropped significantly.\n\nThe only explanation I have is the IV. Which I think was around 6% on the Mar 4th contract last night, but is currently 11%, but I am still surprised by just how big the difference is. The only other explanation I can think of, is that the out-of-hours bid-ask spread is so huge right now, that it is not really *that* cheap to get out of this trade (I am trying to, but its not getting any love).\n\n(back story to this IC entry: I had a Call Credit Spread (bearish the Euro). The ECB meeting caused price to shoot up, and so I turned it into an Iron Condor in the hope of getting out for B/E later, thus allowing me to roll the CCS up for no additional cost).\n\nany other reasons why this might be looking so different out of hours?\n\n***EDIT:*** ***in the last hour it has changed and I am seeing $518 debit to close it now, which is more like what I was expecting. I guess it was the bid-ask spread and lack of liquidity causing it, but confused the hell out me. Back to damage control, like I thought!***"

The market price of the /ES is now 4474. The delta is 55.06 for the call and -44.96 for the put. I would expect the price of each to be fairly close to offsetting each other or slightly higher for the call and showing a slight profit as the delta moves greater. Yet the call is only at a value of 55 and the put is at 38. I only purchased this within the hour. Why is there such a large difference in price? Why didn't the call appreciate in value as fast as the put fell in value? It couldn't have been theta burn and the gamma and vega are equal to each other. What do you guys think?"

I bought May 17 calls when MSFT was trading at around $120 and, over a span of one week, they've yielded an unrealized return of 50% on the back of analyst recommendations and excitement over earnings (we're now at $123.40).\n\nI'm surprised by the absence of people simply riding calls up to, and until, a company's earnings. Quality names receive a large amount of anticipatory bids compounded by buy ratings or reiterated buy ratings at higher price targets. This is clustered right before reports are published. I'm doing the same with Facebook.\n\nFor MSFT, I'll sell my calls before they release their numbers -- MSFT usually trades sideways following earnings and IV evaporates. I did this with IBM too, buying calls about a week before they reported and selling beforehand. In the case of Facebook, I might ride through earnings as it's not a massive position and so far my contracts have done nothing (more bad press). Hopefully FB receives a torrent of buy/overweight ratings and upward revisions to price targets next week."

When Amazon is getting crushed going in buy relatively close to the money or at the money calls that go out with plenty of time value. Even if the stock goes down 500 points on a stock like Amazon the time value will help save you from getting totally crushed and if the stock takes off the time value will decrease once they start getting further into the money.  If you find yourself in that situation you also have a very good problem to have."

DFV is a GREAT example of this too.\n\nOP, I hate that reddit etiquette wants shit compiled into one paragraph.  But for this line of work, analysis like this won't be done in one paragraph.  If it is, I wouldn't trust it.\n\nI appreciate the time you put into this work.  There are people here that really appreciate this mindset and approach to measuring price movement.

It's extremely expensive and operationally intensive, but it gives you the true arb on the implied corr.\n\nThe other benefit of buying components is you can hold to expiration. If you just short the index vol, you're relying on the market correcting this abnormally high corr. But if the market never corrects, then the only way to recognize your vision is to realize the implied vols.\n\nLastly, do you have a screener to track all implied corr? If yes, could you do a correlation relative value trade? where you buy low correlation percentile indices and sell high correlation?"

Couple of clarifying Qs:\n\n1) Your friends who decreased PnL through delta hedging: was this mostly down to transaction costs or was the realized volatility in the period they held the trade high enough to eat into PnL?  \n\n2) \"With this trade structure, I was leaning slightly positive delta. I had **very little theta** or gamma, and a LOT of vega. Basically, as long as the stock didn't trend to hard in one direction, I had a pretty linear trade.\"\n\nI think I answered my own question after writing this :) You would have benefitted from theta but I'm guessing in relation to your vega, it was relatively small.\n\n3) Did you consider some form of calendar spread (i.e. perhaps the dislocation of 1y IV meant that eg 60d IV was underpriced on a relative basis)? I'm assuming there was no need to overcomplicate a good trade - as you say, keep it simple.\n\nCongrats!"

I've had a roller coaster ride with options, but lately, I've lost a lot of money in the last month that I'm dead inside and don't think I'll ever be able to trade logically again without being hampered by emotions.\\n\\nAs an example, around March I sold my Tesla shares for $300 less than what I paid for it. However, Tesla stock soared afterward, and if I hadn't used my paper hand, I would have been getting greens by around 40%.\\n\\nMy problem was that I didn't plan ahead of time before initiating a deal. I really just have emotion to bargain with. Before entering any trade-in, I should've had an exit strategy in place and established what I was seeking to achieve and being realistic.

Trading isn't worth the anguish and frustration... If you're not in the appropriate frame of mind, you'll keep making poor choices out of desperation until your account is entirely blown. \r  \n\r  \nTell you what, you can try using a trading bot assuming you have a lot of experience this time around. For this, I recommend [Breaking Equity](https://www.breakingequity.com/?r=1).

This way if something is down big, you can\u2019t just start trading because you aren\u2019t in the broker app - it\u2019ll gives you a moment to think before you react and check the news too. This helps me decide if the reason I bought is still intact or not and then I decide accordingly.\n\nThe second thing I do is set a price target for the position and add a notification on my tracker app, once again, not my broker. As I mentioned it helps me from opening my broker and trading. If my PT gets hit I re-evaluate and then decide if I feel like riding it out some more and set a new price target and keep holding or selling. I mostly sell because I\u2019m conservative on my short term trades as I just use it to help grow my long stock at this point in life. \n\nI do this for anything 3+ months options and short term shares. I just do earnings checkups on my long holds. \n\nUsing a separate app in general has me in the habit of opening the tracker app instead of my broker, so way less trading and more watching for opportunity."

Trying to understand what a company is really worth and understanding that in 99% of cases that is above or below the current price. That has not so much to do with options, but is at the core of value investing. For me, the price movements doesn\u2019t make me very emotional, as I am more focused on intrinsic value. \n\n2. Think in bets and not outcome. Maybe your decision to sell Tesla was the right decision. You never know about the future, you can just make a decision based on known facts. You have two aces on your hand and go all in: maybe not the wrong decision. You have nothing and go all in but somehow still win unexpectedly: well, good outcome for you but it was not a good play.

Instead of panic sell, i just let go and treated as if it doesnt exist and just left it untouched and moved onto other stocks as i knew the company would spring back sometime later. Took longer than expected but did work out. As for emotional trading, i do believe it helps abit as most ppl think thee similar - if you have strong urge to buy, hold or sell as so many others would do the same. BUT always do some DD before investing unless you are just tossing fee cents here and there just to have some fun like playing slots."

     "My options portfolio is up 293% for the year as of yesterday ($16,700 -> $71,077), but there were years when I too was an emotional trader and lost a lot of money because of it. There\u2019s no shortcut to this lesson, and it\u2019s the single most important and PRODUCTIVE lesson you can learn- congratulations! You\u2019ve experienced what it\u2019s like to trade your feelings  and you will be that much more equipped to be able to ignore them when you open your next positions. As you state, having defined exit plans, or any plans at all, is a huge step toward ensuring that happens. Stock prices never do what you \u201cwant\u201d them to do, but will frequently do what you \u201cthink\u201d they\u2019ll do. \n\nMy advice is 1), regularly reassess if your opinion about what the price will do has changed. If so, adjust accordingly. If not, do nothing (always an overlooked option), and if you\u2019re not sure, do nothing until you are. Dont let your feelings tell you that you must always do something.\n\n 2) Keep track of how often you\u2019re right and wrong so you can make sure the gains you take are large enough to offset the losses. You should be able to know what those ratios are, so if you don\u2019t, start keeping track. \n\nDon\u2019t stop trading! You\u2019ve just learned what will help you make big gains in the years to come!"

If you plan your trading from start to finish you are prepared for negative outcomes also. It is not a sudden event and gives you experience also to make better trades in the future. Don't focus of how the trade evolved but focus on entry and exit planning according to your risk tolerance."

     "The best changes I've made to my strategy after destroying my portfolio are as follows:  \n\n\n**1) There is no such thing as a missed opportunity.**  \nYes, black swan events are rare.    \nHowever, there are so many cases of stocks going up or down by 100s of % in a day or 1000s in a year.  \nChasing a stock is a fool's game and very VERY rarely pays off.  \nDon't try to force an entry or exit point onto a stock you're (emotionally) invested in.  \nIf you have a strategy (swing trading etc) then look for opportunities that fit your criteria and don't try to convince yourself that there's an opportunity there otherwise.\n\n**2) There are only three things that matter when assessing stocks** ***(and they all affect each other.)***  \nTechnical Analysis attempts to measure sentiment, what the market believes is fair value based on buying and selling pressures at different levels of valuation.  \nTA typically remains correct until something changes.\n\nFundamental Analysis looks at actual data, news, numbers.  If TA is the driver then FA is the cop with a speed camera who will chase you down if you're out of line.  Sometimes TA runs away from FA but that's never done without the help of the last one.\n\nSentiment Analysis, which takes things like social media posts and attempts to gauge the wider public opinion about a stock.  This one is fickle, full of liars and trolls.  However, it can be helpful to guide your analysis towards FA or TA if you're unsure.  \n\n\n**3) Leave your ego at the door.**\n\nThis one might be the most relevant for you.  \nIf you have too much ego/confidence you won't second-guess your DD when it's wrong.  \nIf you have too little confidence you won't stop doubting your DD when it's correct.\n\nBe Confident about your DD but avoid confirmation bias, avoid FOMO, avoid unfounded FUD.\n\nBe Objective.  Take the information into consideration in a dispassionate way and use your chosen analyses to figure out if it's helpful to your end goal.\n\nFinally, sometimes results will have nothing to do with your DD.  A company gets bought up at a good price and you pat yourself on the back, even though it was nothing but luck.  \nThat's your ego convincing you that you somehow earned those gains. You didn't really.\n\nSometimes you had everything right and some news comes out that tanks the stock.  \nIt sucks, but that's not on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps."

     "I think being hit helps. You know it hurts and so afraid to do it next time. I just decreased my leverage, reviewed my strategies and now I sleep like a baby.\n\nAlso, you know now, that waiting can help. Don't trade after sharp moves. There often will be at least some rebound. Sometimes a good company makes a dumb move and is screwed till next earnings. It is a waiting game, among other. The market is counterintuitive thing. I do the opposite of what my gut tells me to buy low and sell high.\n\nAlso, maybe you just need to read some literature? Learn about [Kelly Criterion](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/mn0ykx/kellys_criterion_for_gamblers/). It describes, how you are likely to lose, even when the chances are for you, just because of sizing. Don't be overleveraged, it is bad for your mental health and money. It is very important. Learn about the damn risk management! I size my bets, so my max loss on each is not that big. I have some naked puts against margin, but I'll easily stomach even a circuit breakers day.\n\nI think you should put it all aside to calm down and go read some books on this.\n\nAnd the literature says, that you probably won't beat the market, see the arguments for the efficient market hypothesis. I actually treat trading like fun and not money making. And what I do is often just a kind of leverage, I'm fine to have a bit and it is successful in the backtests.\n\nStop loss is not a tool for me. Bad for options, cause volatility and not traded outside hours. Bad, cause not the best price. Bad, cause you cannot wait a bit after a spike. My stop losses would be at like -40% of the stock value, so I just don't bother. Maybe they are very useful for day traders or something.\n\nOr maybe you just screw it and go become a [boglehead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/)? It is not a bad decision, not at all. Just as I won't ever recommend trading, I always recommend passive investing."

     ">d) don't hold shorts through dividends\n\nJust to be clear, dividend risk applies to short calls only.  It is not an issue with short puts.\n\n>c) if assigned on a short position, simply close the long position to cover.\n\nYou may be oversimplifying here and may actually understand this, but it's more complex than that.  If you're assigned on a short option, you now have 1) a shares position in the underlying, and 2) a long option.  What you wrote implies all you have to do is sell the long option, but this isn't true.  If you were assigned on a short put, you need to sell the resultant long shares and sell the long put.  If you were assigned on a short call, you need to buy the resultant short shares and sell the long call.\n\n>1) What happens if there's a large, unexpected move in overnight trading and my short position(s) are assigned on market open ... BUT ... because I'm on Pacific Time (and like to sleep in), I don't become aware of that assignment until the market\u2019s been open 5 hours, and price has rocketed back up or down to where it was before the big move? \n\nAdmittedly most beginner options articles/videos don't go into this so it's a common misunderstanding.  Assignment isn't instantaneous.  Exercise requests received by brokerages throughout the day are sent to the OCC after hours, and assignments are then processed overnight.  If there's a large, unexpected move in after-hours/the premarket, let's say Monday night/Tuesday morning, and because of that, someone chooses to exercise on Tuesday morning, if you happen to get chosen for assignment it will be *Wednesday* morning when you find out about that.\n\nIf in general the idea of not finding out about something until the market's been open 5 hours is intolerable to you, then unfortunately sleeping in while living in the Pacific Time Zone is not an option.  However, it shouldn't' be a big deal, because any price moves in the underlying will also be reflected in the price of your remaining long leg."

     "Prior to expiration, the maximum risk of a debit spread is the premium paid and for a credit spread, the difference in strikes less the premium received.\n\nI don't see any benefit to arbitrarily closing positions 4 days before expiration.  There are reasons for closing early but a fixed date is not one of them.\n\nYou should not hold short equity positions across an ex-div date because you pay out the dividend but it's not a big deal for options since the dividend is priced in.\n\nDebit and credit spreads of the same series are synthetic, aka fungible.  In a fair priced market, they have the same risk profile.  For example, a Sep +50/-55c bull call is the same as a Sep -55/+50p spread. The main differences are B-A width and possible closing costs.\n\nNow, your questions:\n\n1. If asleep and assigned on the short leg, you will not lose anything more because you own the long leg.  The only issue would be if you don't have the BP to carry the equity position.  If your broker's policy is to close them out rather than allow you to meet the margin call, then you'd have more risk.  Also, you never want a broker closing out your positions because they won't work the order for the best possible fill.\n2. If you don't want to lose more than 30% of your account value ($30k), total up the maximum potential loss of all open positions and make sure that it's below $9k.\n3. Do not select positions based on share price.  Making money with spreads involves getting the direction right, or possibly, not wrong.  Diversify so that one position never eats you alive.  Trade as many different positions as you can handle  (on a fast day, if multiple positions are moving against, you don't want to be unable to deal with them all).  Also consider a combination of bullish and bearish so that hopefully, if it hits the fan (market movement not single stock bad news), you have some winners that don't need attention while you deal with the losers.\n\nI'd suggest that you start small.  Some of the answers will come from the experience of trading and you can't learn that from us or from any book. When you know the game, increase your size.\n\nGeez, I'm as bad as you are at writing short posts  :->)"

     "> a) I know many say the Max Risk is the Premium Paid.\n\nWell, you don't know as much as you thought, since that is not correct.\n\nThe **maximum loss at expiration** is the net debit on the spread at open, but that is not the same thing as max risk. You can, for example, lose more than the max loss if you close the spread before expiration. You can also gain more than max profit (spread width - opening debit).\n\n> b) close all positions prior to expiration - no later than 4 days before\n>\n> c) aim for around 75% of max profit which frees up capital for new trades (I see some advocating aiming for 50% - better perhaps)?\n\nYou have 2 out of 3 of the necessary components for a basic exit strategy, but what about your loss limit? When do you bail out if the spread is losing money?\n\n> What happens if there's a large, unexpected move in overnight trading and my short position(s) are assigned on market open\n\nEssentially will never happen, given your strat and correctly stated understanding that assignment on shorts prior to expiration is exceedingly rare.\n\nExamine the time value on the short to have a measure of assignment risk. Risk increases as the amount of time value approaches zero. Since time value is always zero at expiration, that is why most assignments take place on expiration day.\n\n> Should I limit my trading of debit spreads to small stocks (say $15.00 - 35.00 range) \n\nNo. One of the main advantages of vertical spreads is that you can trade the entire market for a reasonable price. Why knee-cap that advantage by limiting your potential market of underlyings to choose from?"

     "I am in a similar position with Tesla.  A month or two ago I bought Oct calls at what was at the time a Tesla high. Implied volatility quickly fell and i sunk into a substantial paper loss position. My advice to you is \u201cdo you still believe in your thesis\u2019. What may have changed since your purchase that may have diluted your thesis? Amazon is facing some antitrust noise from Congress. They are facing some legal noise in Germany and (I think) other parts of Europe. Last week a California appeals court rules that Amazon is liable for third party sales. There is a lot of downward pressure at this moment on Amazon. On the other hand, it doesn\u2019t appear that we are any closer to an end of the covid era. Lastly, Biden stretches his lead and with it, almost surely an increase in capital gains taxes are coming (plus the possibility of a Democrat party sweep which opens the door to new taxes on companies with Amazon). Even if you think Amazon will successfully navigate these items, do you believe they can navigate them within the time frame of your options?\n\nOn the flip side....a lot of people have left a lot of money on the table by leaving Amazon too early.\n\nUltimately you need to ask yourself which would you regret most, selling out of your Amazon options and missing out on watching your thesis become reality OR staying in those options (even if that means rolling them forward) and riding them to a steeper loss. Obviously neither are desirable but which worst case is the more comfortable one.\n\nLastly, consider selling an equal number of same type, same expiration, options at a higher strike price. This will allow you to bring in some premium to offset your losses. Yes, it will cap your gains but maybe the risk reduction is wise. I\u2019m pretty new to all this but one piece of advice I read everywhere is most people should never own open calls or puts. Spreads are highly advised.\n\nWhen I was getting into option trading my father (a finance professor) told me only one thing, \u201cBulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered.\u201d. That\u2019s not entirely true. He also told me \u201cTrees don\u2019t grow to the sky\u201d and \u201cFOMO is not an investing strategy\u201d.\n\nYou most likely have many years ahead of you. Make use of that time to generate real wealth. Don\u2019t try to catch lightning.\nGood luck with your position."

That's an enormous rise for a safe company with such a sure business model combined with crazy innovations (like web services) whose only real worry right now is anti-trust investigations.\n\nI'm holding a  jan15 3600/3700 debit spread, among others, and yeah,  I feel the same way you do sometimes.   Why isn't it moving even more!  I thought 4k was possible by end of year, but was too much risk for my taste, so I opted for the jan15 3600c, offset by selling a 3700c (hence the debit spread) Less money?  sure, I'm definitely willing to give up some profit to lighten the risk.  3600 (at least) is very probably to me by EOY."

The strikes it fills in (based on whatever call/put strike you started with) are in the proper places for the orders, though, but it's offputting.\n\nBut, if you're starting out deep OTM for the initial call, the puts it's filling in automatically aren't all that far below. \n\nSo tinkering with iron condors on AAPL (a tenth of the mark of AMZN, just to see), when selling an IC on AAPL (sitting at 176 currently) at 190, it defaults the potential order thus:\n\nSell call 190 / Buy call 192.5 / Sell put 187.5 / Buy put 185.\n\nNow to do a proper IC, one would adjust the puts to be equally below the current mark as the calls are above the current mark, if I understand the concept of the iron condor properly. But the credit showing for the above setup is 2.37, far above what it would be if the puts were adjusted down to where they \"should\" be. \n\nSetting it up for a single contract on each leg, ToS says the max loss is $13, max profit is $237.\n\nThis can't be right, can it?

I know you said you did but I just wanted to confirm since if that's the case you should be selling cash secured puts as LEAPS rather than buying the long version of LEAPS. This way you get a credit, very high (50%+), immediately and can sell slightly ITM without concern of actually having to pay ITM if you think the stock will rise above that point.\n\nThese are also easier to close out and if assigned usually would represent your desire to own at a lowered price or could easily be closed for far less credit if you had to pay to buy them back and close them. \n\nIf you want to go long though I would recommend you look for companies where the share value has dropped over 70% since that is likely the recovery value, presuming they are going-concerned, and a sound entry point."

With the market trading super hot right now, delta looming and inflation data not looking good in the short term, I think we are more than due for at least a 5% pullback across many sectors, if not more so in big tech.\n\nAnother interesting point of bullishness I can see for Amazon in terms of TA is looking at the One year chart with weekly candles and the 50 day Simple Moving Average. In the past year or so time frame, each time AMZN has dropped down to its 50SMA, it tends to bounce off it as support. As of today it seems to be using the 50SMA as support again and a green candle is forming. I would be inclined to agree with you that it is at a strong support level and your position seems well suited for strong gains"

This was a lot of condensed information that I saved and will refer back to later. \n\nRegarding your limit orders in increments of .05, would this have a higher probability of filling at a minor discount to the ask only if the trade goes against you (i.e. the ask is coming down because the contract itself is losing value as the underlying equity is losing value? Or is this something you are not concerned with because you believe at the end of the day that the contract will gain value before expiration? Do you frequently find yourself going to the mark or you keep disciplined to never bid that high? How do you keep or settle on the bid and ask spreads and find the mark and your eventual limit price with enough time to get all the info into an order placed before they all fluctuate due to the actively trading market?

That means to act as a buyer if you are selling and a seller if you are buying.\n\nthey are in effect the \"authority\", setting the \"menu prices\", until \"active trading\" affects true price discovery.  there are millions of low-vol new/recent listings you can see it in effect.  and an option chain of low/zero vol trading with very clear pricing set isnt just 2 market makers sitting at Ask vs Bid playing chicken with each other.  that's probably a single MM setting both the Ask and Bid, waiting for any to take them on either side of the trade.  they are, in effect, \"setting\" the price."

     "one thing to be aware of for the \"creeping\" order strategy only works for highly liquid options when your order size is small. For SPY or SLV the strategy can work very well. For larger orders of less liquid strikes (EA, or CNK would be a good example) creeping your order will cause the bid/ask to move up!!! it can easily add 5-10 cents because you gave time for the algos and the Market Makers to respond. For size in the less liquid, you can use a block order (i.e. force auction), break it up into small orders at the mid, or use different tenors/strikes"

Just prior to the trading halt, the order book cleared out and the bid-ask became ridiculously large.  The result is that the mark shot up, and my contract showed as -$4,000 on the P/L.  This obviously had a big impact on my net liq and remaining buying power.  I keep pretty decent BP cushion, but could envision scenarios where if you have too many of these open, an artificially high mark caused by wide bid-ask could force your BP negative and potentially into a margin call."

I just got so used to people saying how they could lose all their money trading options or read so many stories about people saying they were millionaires then lost it all trading options that is scared me away.

During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. \n\nNext day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.\n\nFrom my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.\n\nI consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?"

When I bought the contract on Friday I want to say IV was over $100. It climbed most of the day and ended the day at 171. My question is I am relatively aware of IV crush after earnings but when there is an insane unexpected jump does IV crush occur then or will it open tomorrow at like 300% IV?

It's my opinion that in the case of a correction, the DJIA wouldn't drop nearly as much as something like SPY or QQQ.\n\nAs the Dow Jones is price weighted and contains mostly (if not all) value stocks, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are market cap-weighted and contain more growth stocks.\n\nThe frothiness of this market haves me thinking that if there is a correction, the market cap-weighted ETFs containing more growth stocks will take a bigger hit (SPY and QQQ), with DIA receiving some flight-to-safety from sold equities in the former.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this!"

Their current mid price is 5.07, and the current mid price for ITM contracts is 13.53.\n\nThis would be a 266% ROI with no change in IV. \n\n54 days isn't a huge window, and the ROI numbers are even better for March contracts (albeit a smaller window of 26 days).. but this looks interesting, and I'll definitely be looking into it more tomorrow.\n\n**Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

The seller must then maintain a deposit with the cash equivalent of the security (that can sometimes be \"marked-to-value\" if the market value changes a lot) and eventually pay back the FTD so that the FTR can be converted into a share.\n\nIf the seller screws up and doesn't have enough cash, the NSCC goes after all their assets and they're banned from participating in the NSCC in the future. If they don\u2019t have enough money, the NSCC is forced to pay for the security to replace the FTR. It has a clearing fund of $USD 10,518,890,000 as of Q3 last year ([ https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/financials/2020/NSCC-Financial-Statements-Q3-2020.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/financials/2020/NSCC-Financial-Statements-Q3-2020.pdf) ) to pay for stuff like this.\n\nIf the NSCC runs out of money to replace security for the FTR, the membership organizations are on the hook for the cash per Rule 4, Sec 4:\n\n[https://www.dtcc.com/\\~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc\\_rules.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf)\n\nCurrently, there are like 3000 members including most major US banks (here's the list:[ https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/nscc-directories](https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/nscc-directories) ).\n\nThe NSCC also has Clearing Agency Cross-Guaranty Agreements with other entities like the DTC and FICC that have tons of cash in their own clearing funds and are also required to help pay if the NSCC runs out of cash.\n\nSo yeah, if Citadel/Melvin/Brokerages/Shorties go broke and don't have enough money to deliver GME shares to APEX or the NYSE or any other member of the NSCC, this is who ends up paying, and they have deeeeeeeeep pockets because they are literally the collateral backing up the world's entire financial clearing system.\n\nBut they might have to pay out all that dough if Gamestop is worth infinity because no apes ever sell their bananas. \ud83d\udc8e \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80 \ud83d\ude80\n\nWe like the company.

The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\\n\\n**What is this tool good for**\\n\\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\\n\\n# Low IV Tickers List\\n\\n\\\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\\n\\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

Lets take a look, shall we?\\n\\nFor those that want to scan for options activity, you can check out [options flow scanner](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocklabs/option-flow) here.\\n\\n**AMZN  Amazon Inc**\\n\\nA player opened a $47 million dollar bet, short straddle, in AMZN last week. They sold to open 1,000 of each PUT and CALL September 18 contracts at the $3015 strike price to collect a total of $47 million in premium. The player stays profitable if AMZN stays in between a price range of $2,500-$3,500. The closer AMZN stays at $3,000 price after earnings, the morning money the player will keep. This bet looks like they arent expecting earnings to move Amazon that much and are trying to capitalize on the premiums from high volatility at the moment.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gmbnwrr56ub51.png?width=2748&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a4205ba840cb7a1aadc55cf4e07babe4b42d58b\\n\\n**BAB'",

Making money in this market is not the same as it was 2 years ago nor will it be the same 2 years from now. \n\nBeyond learning to evaluate Price/book, earnings, cash flow, debt and sentiment there's many methods of trading options. Butterflies are often used in trading, iron condors almost never, learning what options strategy to employ beyond call and put spreads can help develop your trader acumen. \n\nI'd recommend having multiple targets spanning sectors, start looking at the finviz maps and choose by sector. \n\nI think https://www.earningswhispers.com/ is useful for sorting and looking at different targets.\n\ngood luck!"

But the first scenario is a real possibility. Rare and unlikely, but real. Like when news came out that some iphones were spontaneously bursting into flames.\n\nBut now imagine you have all your money invested in AAPL calls that expire a few days after that news comes out... If it is below your strike on the expiration day, then you lose all of it. Buying an option means buying something with an expiration date and you never want to be left holding the bag of flaming dog poop on the expiration date.\n\nThat's why it is critical to diversify or to keep most of your account in cash. Yes, AAPL is an amazing company and the stock SHOULD always go up. But short term moves are normal and should be anticipated. Don't over commit to one position or strategy."

     "While I am far from overly successful, I think the only thing that matters in an options trade is knowing when to apply your type of trade and how to construct it so the probability of profit is elevated enough that even if you get the strength of the move incorrect, you can still exit a trade with only a scratch at worst.\n\nFor me that means trading spreads.  It cuts a lot of the downside risk out of these positions and depending on what my thesis is regarding an underlying's future move, I can construct something that statistically even if I am wrong, has a fighting chance of letting me get out with a little bit of something.  That means the majority of trades have a credit spread component to them ad only when certain parameters line up do I look towards a debit trade.\n\nThis is what makes options in a sense easier than shares.  In shares, I am either right about the direction or I am wrong.  I either lose money or make money.  For instance in a credit spread, I can still be a little bit wrong or get the timing wrong and I still make money.  I think the biggest issue people have with trading options is they see that little infinity symbol on the long call max profit and they go braindead because to them, they can pay $10 for this call and turn it into a house.  When in reality, they turned that $10 into a $10 loss 99.999% of the time."

Odds are still against any single person being that unicorn.\n\nMy number one suggestion is to keep a simple trading journal. Learn from your mistakes. Unless you luck into a wise mentor, cranking away at the market is not that different from a slot machine. Almost doomed to be feeding the pot"

  "Text": "b' \\n\\nWe use Linear Regression to analyse the Nasdaq Index (IXIC). Linear Regression analysis uses past data to predict future trends. A linear regression channel can be thought of as an equilibrium point and a standard deviation equilibrium line can provide support or resistance. 1 standard deviation means 68% of the data is within +/-1 standard deviation equilibrium line and 2 standard deviation means 95% of the data is within +/-2 standard deviation equilibrium line. The Nasdaq (IXIC) is now running at the top of the channel and has only moved through the top of the channel in the 2000, after incorporating 20 years of Nasdaq data. According to statistics, there is a 95% chance that the Nasdaq will move within this linear reversion channel, so be aware of this and be careful.\\n\\nAs we can see, the Nasdaq has now pulled back from the top, so we can watch out for a short period of overselling.\\n\\nHowever, we have mentioned before that the US stock market has been in a seven-year crash cycle s'",

Are you saying there's a 95% chance for it to remain within this channel until the end of time? Aside from that, how you actually interpret this chart is: \"historically, the Nasdaq has spent 95% of its time within this channel\", not \"there is a 95% chance the Nasdaq will move within this channel\". \n\nAs you should know, price movements follow a random walk and lack stationarity, meaning they have no predictable pattern. What you are doing is assuming the Nasdaq will follow this pattern for no reason other than it fitting within your colorful lines of best fit and I can assure you the stock market is infinitely more complex than you believe it to be."

I use CCs to squeeze more juice out of my returns. It is my \"go to\" options move, but I am mostly in uncovered or long positions in stocks.

     "Wow started reading and 1/2 hour later here I am. Nice detail OP. \n\nI think it is fine and if works for you and beating the market. Rock on for sure. \n\nI too am a long term investor, but deploying several tactics in a much more aggressive manner at moment. This is due to bull thesis since last Oct and thru 2021. \n\nI have my core positions but have been killing on SPACs. I have been getting high returns on underlying and selling CCs and CSPs. Learned to get 125+ shares  so my high fliers will still be left w shares at the end if I still like the stock. \n\nI am all in the market. That is just my thesis. I have margin if I see an opportunity and I also use margin to sell CSPs into. \n\nI also sell CCs on my long term holds like AAPL ADM WBA CSCO etc. one thing is that I have so many damn stonks and options that is spilling into my day job. I need to slow down the weekly plays at least until I exit said job, which will be much sooner if these returns keep up. Will be nice to control my 401k too when the time comes. \n\nGood luck to you and everyone w their strategy. \n\nSee you on the other side.\n\nEdit 4 typos."

     "I use a strategy I call the Value Creation Strategy. Basically, it works by purchasing 100 share blocks of stocks and selling CCs on those shares. I target stocks that are scheduled to go ex-dividend within the option cycle. This captures the dividend, a capital gain and the premium. This purpose of this strategy is to play a short game on a long stock. If the contract(s) execute, I win three ways by collecting the dividend, the premium, and the capital gain. If is expires worthless, I collect the dividend and retain the premium and sell another CC the following month setting up a second premium payment and the potential capital gain. Many of these VCS plays rotate for months before the shares actually sell maximizing the premiums."

     "In a bull market, a safer approach is selling covered calls for a shorter duration. As stocks will generally rise, a call holder will lose out on major gain opportunities if the stock shoots past the strike price. \n\nOP has touched on that, but he should highlight it as a serious danger; writing covered calls aren\u2019t a long strategy, they\u2019re a *short* strategy, because you don\u2019t want the stock to go up; you want it to stay flat, below your strike, or even go down slightly (so you can close the call position early, for a profit.)\n\nI\u2019m guessing OP has experienced that often \u2014 and so have I, which is why I now only set calls for 1-2 months out, max.\n\nMy solution for a suddenly rising stock that I\u2019ve covered is to also write a put at or above the strike, to capture the premium on the upside.\n\nBut I am surprised that OP is satisfied with 10% above S&P. He\u2019s going through a lot of work to eek out a modicum of gain.\n\n(By way of anecdote, I\u2019m up over 100% this past year\u2014 3x the S&P\u2014 averaging 10% *per month* and could have done substantially better still, if I held my positions longer.)"

     "This is a great overall strategy. I think you rightfully point out that one of the biggest disadvantages is the fact that you sometimes have to sit out the big runs. That's typically why some people with say to keep CCs to big slower growers because if you are holding the risk of a volatile stock you want to make sure there is enough potential upside. I think right now IV in a lot of names is incredibly high and can make these trades a no brainier even if there's a risk of a large draw down. \n\nTwo other suggestions I'd add:\n1. Sometimes I make shorter term or more aggressive trades in names I like. For example buying calls in a name I am long equity heading into ER. When these trades work I typically take a portion of the profit and invest it back into the underlying and so I essentially grow my share count with \"house money\". This can be a good way, even with CCs to move your share count from 100 to 200 so you can participate more in the upside like you mentioned, while psychologically silo'ing the risk so you don't feel you're risking fresh capital in a riskier name like a SPCE. \n\n2. This one is a bit contraversial right now with all the short squeeze mania happening, but I use \"Stock Yield Enhancement\" on IBKR. If you are unfamiliar, brokers only lend margined stock to short sellers, but certain brokers will allow you to opt in to lending your fully paid for stock and they split the interest with you. The main downside is you lose your voting rights on those shares if they are lent, but aside from that it functions essentially the same. So if you are holding a more volatile name like AMC, GME etc and selling CCs you can juice it a little more by allowing your shares to also be sold short. A lot of people don't realize that this is possible, but you are allowed to own the stock + sell CCs + lend shares short at the same time."

     "It's a great reference book but I would highly suggest having some knowledge of Calls/Puts before going into it. Think of it as more of an advanced college level book. Most options \"strategies\" haven't changed over the last couple decades. You'll find most options to be slightly more volatile or changes in IV because of the higher amount of retail traders dabbling into the options market (recent article about the last few yrs and the significant increase in retail options trading is interesting). Most of the technical indicators people utilize have held the same. There is a reason it's still one of the highest rated books. A little expensive compared to the amount of free content through YouTube but I would say it's nice to see it on paper and have it laid out in front of you with expertly written processes. A lot of YouTubers will just ramble on about different strategies but their actual thought process can be hard to follow a lot of times, esp when you are talking about 100's of thousands of videos and millions of hours of content to sift through. Finding a legitimate source that is not in it for clicks/some BS PDF sales pitch/subscription for discord can be challenging."

Many businesses are already weighing the possibility of telecommuting and the only real competitor is Google Meet.  With more businesses going down this road and would likely stick to it even after the pandemic due to the savings of telecommuting, there is a very real chance that Zoom's current value has not even come close to its potential."

So, if insurers are happy to write more puts i.e. endure more pain when the stock tanks, it is more than likely not going to happen.

Any user might have some combination of Netflix, Amazon prime, Disney+, Apple TV+, Hulu+ etc.\n\nAll that Netflix needs to do is create enough attractive content to retain its customers who are already sticky and susbcribers. You and some of the folks here are grossly underestimating the value of stickiness in this business. And FOMO. Some cool new original show drops that everyone\u2019s talking about.. what happens then? It would cause people who left to come back. And then, they stay for another year before losing interest.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m bullish on Netflix, Disney as they have sufficient moats in this business."

     "I\u2019m conflicted.\n\nI agree with your assessment of their declining content quality. Also, I think a big part of what made Netflix so great before was the algorithm they used to make suggestions based on your ratings, I don\u2019t know what they changed or when they did it but it seems like it might coincide with when they switched from the star-based ratings to a simple thumbs up/down rating.\n\nTheir pricing is very inflated for the experience IMO and I have seriously considered just cancelling it altogether lately. Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have been getting more of my watch-time lately and Prime is worth the cost just for the delivery benefits, the Music/Video/etc services make their subscription all the more valuable. Hulu is cheaper but their commercials playing at like 130% of the volume of the shows is super annoying.\n\nAnyway, I remember when Netflix recently announced their most recent subscription price increase that their stock responded very positively. I\u2019d be willing to bet the majority of their investors underestimated the competition and overestimated the quality of Netflix during that stock price rise. Unless something big changes I think they\u2019ll start to see subscription rates dip quite substantially, eventually into a net loss of subscribers.\n\nBUT! I don\u2019t want to underestimate the sticky effect of longtime subscription holders just taking a super long time to wake up and drop the service\u2014I still remember hearing stories of people renting their landline telephones from AT&T or one of the Bell companies (can\u2019t remember atm) for decades as recently as the late \u201890s or \u201800s just because they\u2019d never looked at their bill and didn\u2019t know they had other options\u2014they were simply too used to the monthly bill to even consider other options. Granted, we live in a new age but people tend to be creatures of habit and I\u2019m not sure what sort of timeline this \u201cawakening\u201d would require.\n\nGood post, thank you, definitely going to watch them more closely now."

     "Imo Netflix has a bit of a moat - part intentional, part by accident. Keep in mind that they knew pretty early there would be competition - they started by taking down the Goliath we knew as Blockbuster. \n\nNow, what sets them apart? Well, first is the emphasis on original content you specifically can't get elsewhere (Disney+ wants movies in theatres ultimately, HBO max will just be on demand HBO content, etc. - there will always be alternatives for most of the other platforms' content). That is the accident.\n\nWhat is intentional? If you look at their content curation it is actually brilliant for two philosophies they live by:\n\n1) the focus is on keeping you from looking for something - the material doesn't need to be great, it just needs to be good enough. And in fact, it almost does this better when it's not super compelling because something that is A+ content requires heavy focus and not something you'll put on regularly for 3-4 hours. \n\n2) They let the creatives make the material, and they focus on providing a medium for it. They offer comedians deals for stand up specials that they produce, they work out deals with YouTube channels (and usually let them stream it on their end too which doubles as advertising, and they ask famous directors to make a movie exclusively for Netflix. They provide resources to content creators with built in audiences. Want to watch any of the new Chapelle specials? You better get a Netflix subscription. \n\nNetflix is trying to be for streaming what Budweiser is for beer. They are fostering a lifestyle. The desire is to be the case of beer you buy to share with the boys, not the drink you have on special occassion. Marc Randolph, one of the original creators does an amazing interview on the Tim Ferriss podcast if you want to learn more about the inner workings."

     "Wheel stocks that you want to own long term. The wheel and strangles are all good for accentuating gains on an underlying that you are ultimately bullish on. There are only two ways to get burned: either you make money but not as much as people who bought and held, or your CSP gets assigned and the stock plummets. The first sucks but it isn\u2019t the end of the world, the second is how you detonate your account. Importantly, you are more likely to end up bag holding when you chase IV and the highest premiums on over valued stocks. Which is why I don\u2019t dabble in, say $TSLA.\n\nAlso, that being said it\u2019s hard to know what to suggest without knowing what stock price range you are looking at. I see lots of people here recommending $TSLA but that means you are selling puts that obligate you for a 90k purchase (if you take assignment; don\u2019t roll out etc.) I see from your post history that you\u2019ve dabbled in TSLA options before, so maybe that\u2019s your preferred space.

I was underwhelmed, so I suggest a counter-analysis.\\n\\n**Debunking the previous \"analysis\"**\\n\\nBasically, the only arguments were that: the earnings per share and the revenue per share are low. Both of which are usually irrelevant for an early stage company with a high potential for growth.\\n\\nThe earning per share are completely useless for such a company:\\n\\n* Amazon had very low profit, or had losses for a large part of their history (so P/E ratio was >500 for 3 years, with a quarter at 3,600 and 7 quarters at infinity P/E ratio, [source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio)). The average annual return on Amazon stock was +35% since then (1,000% total)\\n* Facebook had a P/E ratio of 1200 at their first quarter. Average annual return of +37% since then (933% total)\\n* Tesla never made a profit, so their P/E ratio has always been infinite. But average annual ret'",

     "The difference between all the companies you mentioned with infinite PE is that they were trailblazers in their respective industries and expanded to other product lines after seeing tremendous growth in their core business.\nZoom has seen tremendous growth due to Covid in a compressed time-frame and have struggled with that growth due to server issues and privacy concerns.\n\nConcurrently, you have 2 large competitors ( Microsoft and Google) that will easily grab market share since Teams and Hangout are integrated with their clients existing product suite. Same with Webex through Cisco, a favorite in corporate setting. That is a significant headwind for Zoom.\n\nOn the consumer side, which isn't a money maker for Zoom, Facebook will definitely grab market share for the same reason, integration within social media.\n\nI think Zoom offers a slim product offering relative to its valuation and will only lose market share and revenue unless they can parlay to another product.\n\nPuts for me."

I struggle to see them growing any further. I also don\u2019t think their revenues go down much unless they increase prices but eventually with one product, you hit a revenue ceiling with no innovations."

     "Thanks for the write up, great read. I too have fallen into the bear argument of \u201ca video meeting service has a PE of 10x that of Amazon\u201d. That said their Covid revenue bump will propel them into 2021 with strength but I do believe this has or will plateau very soon. We are definitely past the period of exponential user growth and they still are not sharing how many of those are the free 40 minute licenses. They shocked the market and their name has become commonplace but at the end of the day I don\u2019t see any competitive advantage that allows them to protect their market share medium to long term. So many companies are already fully integrated with Microsoft cloud suite that it only makes sense that they will eventually offer a better version of Teams with attractive pricing to compete/undercut. Their product is solid no doubt but when it becomes a question of budget I don\u2019t see much brand loyalty personally speaking. \n\nSo the play imo, long dated puts are way too expensive and it probably isn\u2019t moving anytime soon. I\u2019ve had some success selling call spreads against it. Last week 280/290 calls ~30dte were fetching between $2.50-3.00 credit. That said I also have some 240/250 spreads that are currently ITM.

So when someone doesn't mention any negatives I am skeptical of their interest either be this post or the other one calling for  puts. \n\nZm is not as rosy as it is portaied may be it will be but the core business it is having is not in any way a most for them as it's easily replicate by competition and already have done and in works.\n\n So to assume it will have competitive advantage over time from big starlwarts and continue the kind of growth Isa futile assumption. It's market share is most likely will be eaten away by other players so the next big thing is diversification that they will have to do to be competitive.unless we see that happening the valuation is going to be questionable.\n\nBiggest factor op missed is zm got this kind of valuation only because of covid ..if the business was rosy before it would have demanded atleadt relative premium before covid but it did not. That is the whole point of counter argument.\n\nDisclosure no position in ZM"

     "tl;dr - test results for option 2 below. It works out okay if you are methodical, set good levels, have the time and attention to commit if you're close to your limit, and we aren't in a massively volatile market. I'm leaning option 1 for now. \n\nThanks to the back-testing feature on ToS, I was able to test doing exactly what you describe in option 2, as I am interested in developing a similar strategy. \n\nI chose TQQQ as the underlying asset, sold weeklys that were between 6 and 8 percent OTM (I tested 6 and 7 percent OTM), and bought the contract back the instant the share price reached 99.9% of the strike price. \n\nIt's a little time-intensive, so I have only completed the following results: \n\n* 6% OTM weeklys, June-August: $4.92 in premiums earned, $3.62 in premiums paid to avoid being assigned 4 of 13 times, net $1.30 profit\n* 7% OTM weeklys, June-August: $3.77 in premiums earned, $0.78 in premiums paid to avoid being assigned 2/13 times, net $2.99 profit\n* 7% OTM weeklys, Sep-present: $5.54 in premiums earned, $5.47 in premiums paid, assigned 3 of the last four weeks, net $0.07 in profit, heading into a terrifying week to close out the quarter. \n\nThere's potential, but it seems like a lot of work and requires lots of attention and firm rule-setting for if/when to buy back, and if you aren't able to hawkishly devote attention when it gets close, you either make decisions that deviate from your plan, or you snooze for a few minutes and suddenly the rebuy is at a much larger loss than you intended, forcing you to choose between getting assigned and eating a much larger loss than necessary at a volatile and sensitive point in the process."

     "They're awesome.\n\nFrom my options guide:\n\n\n* Diagonal Spreads: PMCC / PMCP\n\nPMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call (or poor man's covered puts).\u00a0 They are nicknames for diagonal options, often used with longer term options or LEAPS.\u00a0 You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.\n\nThese are very powerful; I\u2019m using them more and more often to replace \u201cnon-explosive\u201d growth calls and long term plays.\n\nAn experienced E-Trade instructor calls PMCCs \u201crenting stock\u201d, which I wholeheartedly agree with.\u00a0 Being able to sell CCs without locking down large amounts of capital, to cover the cost of 100 shares or taking the high-risk of selling calls naked, is awesome.\n\nFor PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.\u00a0 These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.\u00a0 If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting \"blown by\" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.\u00a0 Keeping your purchased LEAPS deeper ITM should protect you.\u00a0 Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.\n\nLike most spreads selling a CC will cap your near term profits, typically providing max profit (or loss) near the CC expiry.\n\nThe diagonal CC you sell will modify your positions overall greeks, specifically delta and theta.\u00a0 The delta reduction will lead to slower gains (until the CC expires).\u00a0 The theta from the solid CC will be positive.\u00a0 If you set up your CCs right, you can\u00a0\n\nI'm currently tinkering with these myself.\u00a0 These are my parameters that I\u2019m testing, use at your own risk.\n\nLong call DTE at least 6 months, preferably ~1 year+ LEAPS. \u00a0 14-20 or 30-45 DTE calls on my CC.\n\n.7-.9 delta long leg.\n\nKamikaze cash recommends a .4 to .5 delta difference between the long and short legs, which I agree with to prevent \u201cblowout\u201d if the price spikes and the short CC delta ramps up drastically.\u00a0 I try not to go below .3 delta difference.\n\nThe goal is to hold the LEAPS long term, potentially until expiration (or 3-6 months before when theta starts getting noticeable), and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.\u00a0 Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAPS anymore.\n\nE-Trade recommends you pay less than the width of your strikes, which I think is smart.\u00a0\n\nSome people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my LEAPS cost basis until it's zero (or even negative).\u00a0 I have a page in my notebook/excel sheet I write each CC on my $NIO LEAPS (I Meme stock sometimes).\u00a0 I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.\u00a0 When I originally wrote this I had ~2 years left on it and it's 9-10% paid for; that doesn't even count the actual gains the LEAPS has.\n\nTT states this is considered an IV play, which I partially agree with.\u00a0 You want to buy these during low IV times since an IV drop will hurt your LEAPS value.\u00a0 I look at them more as a way to sell calls/puts on a high IV company with a lot of price movement and potential upside/downside.\n\nhttps://us.etrade.com/knowledge/events/webinars/diagonal-spreads-time-decay-08132020\n\nKamikaze Cash: https://youtu.be/Q8A0WXbXXgA\n\nTasty Trade PMCC videos:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JDQrc3qpRTI\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Mq_Y8RRSCA8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jQ6oSawgRvM"

     "I think there\u2019s a near-term bullish case that needs to be considered seriously. \n\nFirst: I agree DASH is overvalued. Let\u2019s not argue that. What I think needs discussion is whether valuation (or value) is an accurate representation of stock pricing\u2014and, by extension, options pricing\u2014over the next year or so. \n\nThe current configuration of stimulus payments incentivizes gambling. A modest one-time check can\u2019t go very far. Sure, you can pay your rent with it, but then you\u2019re stuck next month, when there is no more stimulus money. So maybe you buy some nice sneakers instead, because those will last at least a year. Maybe you eat very well for a few days. Maybe you buy a new iPhone. These are all things people are thinking about with their stimulus money... and, at some point, some people will think, \u201cwhat if I turn this $1200 into $10,000?\u201d\n\nThe rationale here is simple. The $1200 can\u2019t do much more than buy a few things; however, it represents a zero-risk gamble with a high potential payoff. So, it makes sense people will plow money into high-risk investments\u2014because to them, these are \u201czero-risk, high-reward\u201d investments. One such investment is Doordash stock. \n\nNarrative economics. Nobel laureate Robert Shiller has done quite a bit of research into the stories people tell and how they affect stock prices. Today, these narratives take the form of memes, and in the case of Doordash, meme stocks. This \u201cnarrative economic effect\u201d cannot be understated, since it can not only drive stock prices, but can also drive intangible or goodwill value in the balance sheet. Moreover, we are in a period where news information is transmitted over social media, and social media is biased according to personal preferences. This means it\u2019s entirely possible a sub population of investors receive skewed financial information about stocks like Doordash, because it\u2019s more likely to be consumed (and not because it\u2019s entirely accurate).\n\nSo, in December 2020, we have a possible stimulus check being issued to Americans. Similarly, there may be one or more stimulus packages in the first half of 2021, to combat rising poverty in the US. Maybe another stimulus in the second half of 2021 to get the economy going while vaccinations gain traction and hospitalizations go way down.\n\nWith looming lockdowns and logistical challenges to delivering vaccines far and wide, it\u2019s possible DASH squeezes out profits for a couple of quarters. That can solidify its nascent meme status over at wallstreetbets.\n\nAnd what if they issue more shares to create a substantial cash reserve at the current stock price?

     "Hey, dasher here (I also drive for uber eats). The claim that dashers make less than $2 an hour is absolute horseshit. From the Salon (lmao) article you linked:\n\n>What it boils down to is that DoorDash has created a pay model in which workers appear to be making a decent wage on paper, but which, after expenses, is barely more than $0. Worse, only 11 percent of DoorDash jobs paid above the U.S.'s laughable federal minimum wage.\n\nDoes this not smell like bullshit on the surface? $0/hour? Are you fucking kidding me. I typically drive for DD and Ubereats simultaneously. I take the best orders I get (usually if it looks like they left a decent tip) by calculating whether the order makes slightly more than min wage (in los angeles that is $15/hour). For example: If I get an order for $5 and it takes 15 mins to complete, I'll take it. If I get a $3 order that takes 20 mins to complete I'll laugh and decline it.\n\nMornings I get anywhere between $13-20 an hour (most of which is starbucks and mcdonalds. Also keep in mind starbucks has a special deal with Ubereats and now postmates so doordash is left out of those lucrative morning deliveries). Evenings its anywhere between  $15-$30 an hour. Just last Sunday I made $90 in 3 hours of driving. I know what you may be thinking \"but what about your taxes and gas?\". Independent contractor tax is 30%. Pretty steep I know. But that doesn't factor in major mileage deductions. I track all the miles I drive and use an app to see how much I save. $0.57 tax deduction per mile. In the end I am paying about 15% in taxes.\n\nI know this doesn't have much to do with the point of your post but I thought I would set the record straight because I know a lot of people will read that \"less than $2/hour\" thing and be confused.\n\nAlso fyi to people that order ubereats/doordash. Us delivery drivers can see how much we are going to make on your delivery when it is offered to us. Don't expect your food to arrive warm if you don't leave a tip when ordering. I personally ignore orders with no tip, and I hope other drivers do too."

     "Thanks for making this video.  Having never traded options, I learned a lot.  Especially appreciated your \u201clight on the lingo\u201d approach.  I\u2019ll add my thoughts as an outsider.\n\nAs is generally the case in options discussions, I didn\u2019t see anything addressing what I see as the central question: correctly identifying mispricings.  There is a relationship between the underlying and it\u2019s various derivatives.  If the market is getting that relationship wrong, there will generally be some a trading strategy that one can apply to it that generates alpha.  That\u2019s a big If, though.\n\nFor instance, I believe you stated that IV generally goes down after earnings calls.  There should be a way to exploit this, *unless* the market already priced in that tendency.  My hypothesis would be that if you graphed the current prices of the same option, purchased right now, over the series of available expiration dates you might choose, you would see a kink in the curve at the earnings call date.\n\nI believe the market is right most of the time.  I\u2019m interested in seeing a step by step process by which skilled traders come to the conclusion that, \u201cThis situation is an exception to the rule; I\u2019m right on this and the market is wrong.\u201d  As far as I can tell, this part is the only reason to bother with trading at all, yet it rarely gets addressed or even noticed!\n\nOr if my premise is wrong on any of the above, I\u2019m all ears."

     "Hey, I'm the guy from the livestream who was asking that question about expected values.\n\nFirst of all, thanks for taking time out of your day to share your knowledge with us! It really means a lot to people like me who are just getting started.\n\n I'm fairly new to this, so forgive me if what I'm trying to ask is confusing. My question was trying to get at how it's possible to even make money trading options, from a theoretical standpoint.\n\nMy understanding is that options essentially price risk vs return. So even if a trade, let\u2019s say a credit spread, has a higher probability of profit because it is more out of the money, then you will receive a lower premium on it. I remember reading about this here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/90cjc0/expected\\_value\\_and\\_high\\_vs\\_low\\_probability\\_trades/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/90cjc0/expected_value_and_high_vs_low_probability_trades/)), and from my basic probability knowledge, that this will come out to an expected value of zero for any options trade. So if I was to run thousands of trades, I would net zero.\n\nIn this sense, my understanding is that in order to actually make money you need to have some sort of edge. For a large hedge fund, this can be getting better prices/premiums than a retail investor would. What I'm trying to understand is what that competitive edge is for you that ensures you make money/are profitable on a trade like your iron condor on Shopify. Because, if my understanding is correct, then even though that trade has a really low likelihood of crossing your put/call strike prices, the profitability potential accounts for that. So even if you made a little bit each time on Shopify from 100 trades like that, if one of those trades went against you, that could wipe out the profits from the other 99 trades. What I'm trying to understand is what you\u2019re evaluating/considering before making this trade so it doesn\u2019t end up losing you money and come out profitable.\n\nSorry that this is really long. I\u2019m just trying to get my question across to you as clearly as possible. And thanks again for all of your help!"

The same is true of all of the other items; there's nothing here that indicates that over time this is true and random segments of time (in this case, one quarter) are flat out noisy; for instance Tilray is a \"weed play\"; there's nothing about Tilray fundamentally that makes it interesting therefore there's nothing about this patternwork that indicates that this is rational *for Tilray*. It might be rational *for the sector*.\n\nIf it is rational for the sector your entire proposition is fucked. It makes zero sense. Now we do already use sector based argumentation so there's little to be said of that but that again completely destroys your proposition; in the case of OCGN penny stocks everywhere have been flying off the handle even without real viability, in the case of MVIS, no one cared about the technology until Tesla and Auto-Driving became popular *which means that it is not actually sentiment for the company, it's sentiment for a series of \"correlated\" ideas*.\n\nI could go on and on about how this is just really bad research and likely complete and utter noisy bunk because it's not been shown true at random points in history and you've got extremely correlated timeframes to boot with an equivalent environment for each one but there's only one way to truly see if something works empirically:\n\nTrade it.\n\nSo, put the money up.

We can use delta as an estimate of the probability of expiring ITM, which is any price at or over 160. The delta on the Sep 2022 160 call is 49. That means there's roughly a 49% chance that call will expire ITM. \n\n49% seems a lot lower than the 100% you claim to KNOW the price will reach, and yet the market is pricing that call at a much lower probability of ITM. It appears that the market doesn't completely agree with your assessment that AAPL must be over 160 by next September. Otherwise the 160 call would have a delta of 100."

No one cares if they are positive on earnings, but if their growth declines, then you'll see a huge drop. If a company's revenue is growing 100% YoY, you can justify a very forward valuation, but every tick makes a huge difference when you look at a five year forward forecast. The other risk would be lower than expected growth in gross margins. \n\nGonna look at put diagonals and verticals and watch for an opportunity (i.e. green day or big IV differential in term structure)."

At the money calls are only $2 and could easily be worth $10+ by expiration\n\nStill, ETFs are weird. I've been following META since they were new (before FB changed its name). I thought the hype of the Metaverse would take off and while the ETF did have a good run up to $17, it's given back all of those gains so far.\n\nI think FB could ironically pose a threat to META. It's been lagging behind other tech stocks and honestly I don't think Zuck's metaverse is really exciting anyone right now. The rebranding seems to have lukewarm response and it could be years before anything tangible actually comes from the changes. But MSFT and NVDA are two tickers that should be guaranteed to gain next year. RBLX is a toss up. \n\nSo all in all, I think you're better off just investing in MSFT and NVDA. The low price of META is enticing but honestly I don't think its holdings are all that strong. SNAP is a piece of crap and I think AMZN is in for a rough year in 2022"

I had taken some leverage on margin to boost portfolio returns. However, I am not comfortable with the level of leverage I have as of now. However, I am expecting a cash bonus in Mar'22 end which would comfortably reduce my leverage. But I don't want to have the current level of leverage for 4 months (Dec'21 to Mar'22) since it feels high and is giving me some stress. \\n\\nMy idea was as follows:\\n\\n* I have 50 shares of Amazon which I can sell. Once I sell Amazon my leverage goes down significantly and I will have greater peace of mind. However, in an ideal world, I would definitely not want to sell Amazon.\\n* Hence I thought I will buy April 2022 call options on Amazon at Strike price of 3500 (current price) -> It is around 280$ on 3500$.

You could potentially be replacing less expensive leverage with more expensive leverage. Aren\u2019t there other  solutions like selling off *part* of your Amazon position and not all 50 shares? You can think of your \u201cAt the Money\u201d call as giving you control of roughly 53 shares of AMZN (a $189,000 notional value) for only $26,000. That\u2019s a leverage ratio of more than 7 to 1. This option will begin to decay rapidly in about 60 days and if it is still roughly at the money doubly so.

And typically you'd seek 50% max profit, which would mean a GTC close  order at $13.5\n3. Whatever you do, don't let your spread go through expiration. Pin risk isn't something you want to mess with. Though you may need to get creative to close a position that is way OTM or ITM if you are using leaps so it's closer to the mark on close."

     "Here are my predictions for what it is worth. I am prepared to be wrong and I appreciate OPs post!\n\nAAPL - Probably lower than expected revenues. Their stores were closed so that really hurts them and they were closed for a good chunk of the quarter. Furthermore, I read somewhere that when they opened stores, a majority of the customers were not there for new purchases, but for repairs. Their products are expensive and unemployment can't be good for their premium product sales (iphones, laptops, etc.). Big pull back after down into the $350s/$360s.\n\nLast note I forgot - hence the edit: The iphone announcement will be HUGE. I read some rumors that they are looking to Q4 now and NOT a September release for the new phone. 49.7% if Apple's revenue comes from Iphone sales!  If they are still pushing for September, all quarterly sales news, good or bad will not even matter. $400+ here we come!\n\nAMZN - Amazing revenues.... like insane revenues from both goods and AWS. But lower earnings due to added COVID measures. Small 3-5% pull back into the $2800s, maybe even a bit into the $2700s. AWS is my watch here. MSFT's Azure really crushed it last week. Either they are eating into AWS OR remote work will propel them. The earnings bar is set really high for them so I worry that even as well as they do, they still might disappoint.\n\nGOOGL/FB - Who friggin' knows. I can't imagine companies are spending a ton of marketing dollars AND laying people off. That doesn't make sense.\n\nNASDAQ/Tech Bubble - There is a retraction UNTIL the new stimulus is passed. And then things pop back up to where they are now. OR until good COVID news is generated (good vaccine, numbers going down, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Fu\\*k tomorrow is a really big and frankly scary day. Right now I am leaning more towards a red AH and Friday :( Hope I am wrong."

I anticipate people trimmed their subscriptions, so reoccurring rev. will be down\n\nFB - Who knows, when I log in I always see these \"stock Gurus\" pumping their programs. I anticipate that advertisers are going to move to that vs TV especially given sports are just coming back\n\nGoogle - Similar thoughts with facebook, but everyone in states with high covid 19 had to move to online advertising, and also I think their cloud infrastructure is growing."

Ill keep it short.\\n\\nThe fiscal third-quarter earnings report had left JCP hoping the holidays would give it some breathing room, but instead, the company saw comparable-store sales plunge 7.5% during the nine-week period ending Jan. 4, 2020. Even excluding the exit from the appliance and furniture categories, comps were down 5.3% year over year.\\n\\nNow, JCP has just $386 million in cash and short-term investments and over $3.7 billion in total indebtedness. Being so highly leveraged, the company is limited in its ability to obtain additional financing. \\n\\nWith stores being shut down because of the virus, and lack of any funds to sustain for the future, JCP is quite literally on a train to oblivion. \\n\\nTLDR: JCP 0.5p 4/9'",

Your losses can be astronomical. \n\nIf however you purchased 100 shares of amazon and wrote a call against the shares to lower your basis, that would be a substantially better idea. Yes you cap your upside but you gain downside protection and collect premium as income while you roll the short calls. Plus even if amazon explodes upwards you still have a gain from your basis up to the strike of the short call. Then you can sell cash secured puts and go the other way to renter amazon if you wanted.\n\nThe obvious issue is you need enough cash to buy 100 shares of amazon. Maybe find a cheaper stock and buy/write (purchase shares and sell a call) so you can learn and hopefully make a little $ in the meantime."

     "> Rolling loosing credit or debit spreads seem common place.\n\nNot true. Futile attempts to rescue losing trades may be commonplace, which means you see a lot of discussion about those attempts, but what you don't see is the final outcome, which may be a larger loss than if they had just cut their losses sooner.\n\nYou roll the untested side of an IC because it's the profitable side. Realizing some profit reduces the size of your net loss, at least in that moment in time. There's nothing that says your tested wing can't lose more money in the future.\n\nAnd who rolls the tested side of vertical spreads? Normally the entire spread is rolled, not just one leg."

     "One reason we can speculate the volatility of Hershey's might go up, is that they were caught buying cocoa beans on options exchanges, trying to avoid buying from the facility set up with anti-child labor protections.\n\n1. Hershey's options purchases of cocoa beans send beans up higher 6 days ago: https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/11/22/cocoa-futures-skyrocket-thanks-reported-hersheys-trade\n\n2. None of this gets much notice, including when West African countries busted Hershey & threatened reprisal, except after the dispute is \"settled\" and Hershey's stock price actually ROSE for that reason 3 days ago: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-iac/interactive-ford-eastman-kodak-more.html. So far, Hershey's just sees net gains due to its bad behavior.\n\n3. But in the past couple of days, Hershey's child-labor cocoa beans buys is starting to get some attention. See this NBC article yesterday: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/the-war-on-cocoa-hershey-co-accused-of-not-upholding-sustainability-efforts-in-west-africa/2421880/\n\nPersonally, I think Hershey's needs to be called out for its child labor cocoa beans buys, because it's not the first time it's been caught trying to undercut basic price controls in what is already one of the lowest-wage regions of the world, with or without child labor.  They also were called out for child labor chocolate in 2019:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/\n\nThis is literally just brutally greedy behavior, because it's practically impossible to find labor that is cheaper than what these workers already make with the price controls. \n\nI'm seriously considering attacking Hershey stock on one of Reddit's forums, because they have been continuing to engage in this behavior. Stockholder activism is sometimes the only way these companies change abuses. \n\ntldr; Hershey's has been secret-buying child labor cocoa beans on options exchanges this year, and has been a problem behind child labor cocoa for years, in fact. It stock deserves some volatility right about now. This is a heads up I might post a rant about Hershey's behavior, asking for stockholder activism next week."

     "I got burned HARD by selling 20 July 60 calls last Friday. Had to hedge Monday morning at a -$32k loss (80% of the premium I received). Thank God I hedged when I did or I would have gotten liquidated at -$100k or so. And this was only with a $100k account. I got lucky and purchased 5 of the calls back and sold the 500 shares to break even on those 5/500. Should have held a bit longer and could have cleaned house, but when the trade goes bad and there is no fundamentals in play for me to risk holding the shares past break even all I try to do is limit losses/damage control. Someone will time this thing right and sell some naked calls and make bank, but those of us who thought 60 was insane last Friday and are thinking 300 is insane now could be in for a massive loss. Who knows. The naked guys had a fraction of a percent of losing these trades receiving 33% premiums, but they won that losing lottery (like me). I'm out of trying to profit from this one myself. I'll be happy if I can manage to weather it and my options don't get executed (or if they do at this point, I'd rather be out because when this thing tanks I could be worse off hedging at $96.41) and somehow still break even or cut my losses in half at this point."

Amazing book, but Page 480 (comparing expected standard deviation moves of options with actual moves over a 10 year time period) just blew my mind. Most of my strategies are based on the assumption that the expected standard deviation of an option is roughly equal to the probability, but obviously not. The expected standard deviation of an option underestimates the number of small moves, overestimates the number of intermediate moves, and underestimates the number of large moves. Unfortunately, Natenburg touches on this topic but just moves on, without going into depth about it\\n\\nDoes anyone know of any books that can help me under this concept better?

     "Download the time series data of whichever financial instrument you like. Calculate the log daily returns of said instrument. Now run 4 separate calculations. The first being the average of the returns (the mean), the second being the standard deviation, the third being the skew, and the fourth being the kurtosis. \n\nAlmost every single time you will see the same thing. A kurtosis value > 3. Kurtosis is the fourth moment of the distribution. Higher amounts of kurtosis (leptokurtosis) causes a higher than expected amount of data to be within +-1\u03c3, and a lower than expected between 2 & 1 \u03c3 and an excess of data outside of +- 3\u03c3. \n\nEssentially what this is showing is that there are lots of little moves, and lots of large moves. \n\nAt the back of the Natenberg book there is a brief look at implying distributions from the prices of butterflies. In the BSM world, this implied distribution at time T will be perfectly fit to the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation fit to the annualised standard deviation given by the option prices. However, for equity indices, in the real world option prices observed give an implied distribution that had a negative skew, and fat tails. You can compare the distributions from these prices to the standard normal distribution given by the ATM vol. You can see the difference and it\u2019ll look very much like the Natenberg example. \n\nThe debate is whether skew is underpriced or overpriced. Is it cheap to buy or expensive to sell? There is a tonne of interesting material out there to look at. Whilst he\u2019s a total knob, Taleb makes for good reading with some of his newest stuff. Anyhow, hope that was helpful.

     ">I buy some time for country to open up, cases to spike, second round of lockdowns\n\nI do not want to change your perspective, but I'd like to offer you a different view to consider: Stanford just published a study saying the real number of infected people is 50-85 times greater than is being reported. That means, the death rate is actually less than a whole fraction. That means, it isn't that scary. \n\nThere most likely won't be a second round of closures. I have told people that this is about the oil war and reelection for Trump. They had Opec+ and G20 meeting and then a week later started discussing reopening the economy. So, the virus just disappeared because we fixed the oil situation? This week they started reporting on potential cures. GILD has been making headlines, yet when this whole thing started, no one was talking about the article that said 2 guys on the west coast created a cure for covid-19 in 3 hours. \n\nThe big news was the stimulus package signed into place. That is for the elections. Without this fear of a virus, how could you bleed the country to pay everyone off? \n\nHow could you get funding from the most valuable man in the world (Bezos)? Force his numbers to increase. Amazon is crushing it right now. \n\nNow that all the pieces are in place, we need to reopen by May 1st. The truth Trump has discussed is, we NEED to reopen the country. As the USA we only have our work and production backing us, take that away and WE WILL FAIL as a country. \n\nThe scary thing that will bring the market down again: Unemployment #s and missed EPS. This market is trending on Hope's and dreams. No reason it should be climbing, we know numbers are going to be miserable. Companies are bleeding money, the future is uncertain and the economy is shutdown. How could the market be climbing? We are all remembering 2009 and how cheap things were and the huge gains that came from it. People that have no idea about investing or finance are saying this is the best time to invest. Why, because that's what happened in 2009? \n\nSorry for the rant."

     "If you want a chance at succeeding with options, you really need to understand the inter-relationship between option strategies, be able to adjust positions if defending them and how to employ disciplined risk management. You're not going to learn much more than the basics online.\r  \n\r  \nPick up a copy of \"Options as a Strategic Investment\" by Lawrence G. McMillan. Read it. Then read it again. It is well written with many clear examples. It also explains a variety of more complex option strategies and should they intrigue you, you can read more.\r  \n\r  \n\"Option Volatility & Pricing: Advanced Trading Strategies and Techniques\" by Sheldon Natenberg is worthwhile if you want to learn about the Greeks, etc. but AFAIC, most of that isn't needed for the Average Joe retail trader."

Like most options books I usually find a few nuggets in there that are helpful but the main problem with this book is the options market has changed so much.   Many of the ideas and examples he gives assume monthly option expiration like we had back in 2009.  Now, most liquid options have weekly expirations (and some like SPY have expirations 3 times per week).   This is a huge shift for anyone trying to play expiration effects like stock pinning which is a big chunk of the book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI backtested a few of the strategies and could not really find any that would have worked (at least not in the time period I tested).   I am not saying they don't work, just that things are so different now.

     "One of the best posts in this subreddit all year. \n\n> Options without PM margin is suckers game\n\nThis is #1 in my opinion. Hard lesson to learn and a long lesson as you need the right account circumstances before even getting started analyzing trading like this first hand, and when you get there it feels like you are back at square 1 on the learning curve, because everything you learned about options trading with a child's account turns out is seriously incomplete, useless or wrong. I am back at/still at square one in my learning I feel, even tho I been doing this for a few years now. It is easy to get the basics but tough to get good without a mentor or working in the industry for a time - not impossible to self learn just a long road and I'd love to figure out a better way to address this. \n\nI like your one hand tied/nuts kicked analogy and I agree. It took me too long to realize if you as a trader can't step in to buy or short a full +100 delta of the stock that underlies a contract should you need to (*and* hold that delta overnight when needed) then you are not truly trading options on stocks. You are trading *options on options* at best, I don't know what to call it, most likely you're trading options on lies, hopes, dreams and prayers. Options are contracts with benefits to both buyer and seller, if you can't utilize all the benefits of a contract (should you want to or need to) compared to others in the market who can then you will always be stuck paying full price for a thing but only getting half its features. You give away value for free because you can't utilize it and you may be giving it away without even knowing it. Even if you did realize what is actually happening, you are outgunned in the market and a sucker indeed. Holding all the risk in exchange for a fraction of the reward, maybe. PM margin or at the very least PDT size accounts are a must in order to bring trading in options markets to a slightly, tolerable level of unfair. \n\n> *Your over leveraged if cannot take day off\"\n\nIs this a quote? It's interesting. I guess you could also argue 'if you can take a day off you are under leveraged'. That's ok. Taking a day off shouldn't be free, there should be some cost. Maybe the goal should be a cost as minimal as possible. There are no perpetual motion machines. Even the most algo of algo trading shops I have seen, with many more computers than employees, still have humans show up to work in the office *every day*. There is no such thing as a stable perfect amount of leverage either, so maybe lever up on good on days when you are fully present, and lever down on days you take off, hopefully these days balance in the right way. \n\nLearning on how to adjust that ongoing leverage and risk is the real skill, art and science There are many ways people go about it. I like to use calendar and diagonal spreads. I think calendar and diagonals are the most misunderstood and mispriced premiums in the market. I don't claim to understand them or price them better than anyone else, but at least I know the market maker across from me in the trade can't price them better either. We are guessing together. Ever read a good explanation of the relationship between option price, implied volatility and vega? You have not. Because all else equal and constant, implied volatility = price, and so vega is basically as useful as saying if $100 goes up to $101, that is a 1% increase so $1 = 1%, for now, maybe. Vega is not a risk. Volatility might be a risk tho. In long calendar spreads you will often read you are long volatility and/or long vega...OK...At the same time you will read a long calendar spread profits when the underlying security stays relatively stable and moves little and it losses money if the underlying experiences any relatively large rapid moves in either direction (now that sounds a lot like volatility to me). Well fuck which is it? A calendar spread long volatility but it losses money when the stock is volatile? WTF. Volatility helps long dated options more than short dated options you say AND volatility is what kills a calendar spread? Both can't be true. But both are true. You could say there is a difference between volatility and implied volatility? That's obvious because volatility is volatility and IV is just an output of price. A calendar spread is both long and short volatility at the same time in an unknown ratio the market will decide later. If you want to take a day off sometimes, calendar spreads are your friend, shifting the term structure of the position or flipping the short and long sides make for relatively easy adjustments and hedging. \n\nEnjoy Europe with the family. I look forward to reading more of your posts. \n\n\n "
