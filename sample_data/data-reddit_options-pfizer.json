  "Text": "b\"Johnson and Johnson spun off its consumer division with Kenvue's IPO yesterday and the new company has a market cap of around $46.5 billion.  JNJ still holds roughly 90% of the shares of Kenvue worth around  $42 billion with plans to distribute the shares to existing JNJ shareholders sometime in September.  $42 billion in value translates to around 10% of JNJ's market cap.  In my mind theoretically JNJ's stock price should drop by 10% upon distribution similar to a normal dividend.  I don't believe they have set a specific date for the distribution but I would assume that options pricing should reflect a 10% hit in the September/ October expiration but it doesn't appear to.  I'm assuming this means I'm missing something - any ideas or insight into what I'm not seeing is much appreciated.\"",

And another $38 call on April 14th expiring April 30th it's now worth $164. \n\nEdited to add I paid $29 dollars for the call expiring on the 30th of April. \n\nI know not like a lot of people's options going to the moon but hey I feel like I'm in orbit with these.

  "Text": "b\"So recently I felt Pfizer had been under valued for quite a while (mostly due to pandemic more than chart) and so I figured it was due for a correction. I wanted to capitalize on this but am extremely new to options with a small account of 500. So I purchased a call option 4/16 exp. with strike of 34 halfway through the moderate rise of yesterday for 1.15 premium. Since then it's gone tp 1.35. I think it's got a bit more room to grow and think the stock could see 37 by end of week, assuming Powell doesn't screw me. But seeing as I'm a new trader to options I've got fears for value of option because I'm not fully confident the Greeks won't set me on a tumble if I have a bad day.  With a current gamma of .1364 and Vega of .0468 how should I expect these to affect pricing as time passes? Assuming it goes how I think it will, how can I calculate expected returns? Is there a formula I can use? Thank you and sorry if my post doesn't fit all the rules, i don't know who else to ask.\"",

There is a reason for this.\\n\\nAside from noticing when to jump into the trade, or noticing where a good setup is, a bunch of people send me messages asking me what I look for when evaluating a good trade or how I know a good trade is going to come within the next few weeks or months.\\n\\nThis is some of the basic stuff I look for every single time I think about opening a position on a stock. I am going to try to break this down as simple as I can since I am paraphrasing from the free-education section of the Discord I run.\\n\\n1. Find the stock or ticker. Perhaps you heard of this company through a friend or with positive news? Is this your first time looking at the stock? Doesn't matter. Open the chart, put it on the D (daily) or W (weekly) chart.

     "Thanks for the detailed post.  I read it with interest as I am short ZIM and long PLTR so we definitely have different lines of thought. :)  I'll share my thesis for anyone interested.\n\nI can't post charts in a reply which would help illustrate my thinking, but ZIM I've been short since September at 60.20, and MATX as well.  Yes looking at FCF and revenues at the moment look great, but my thinking was more in line with what we saw with PTON, ZM, TDOC selling off as they were temporary long covid plays to begin with and financials looked great only while the markets they drive revenue from are strong.  Markets are forward looking so current FCF is less important for stock price than future financials, which is what I'm speculating on reversing, where I believe you are speculating on a continuation.\n\nZIM/MATX financials are up because the underlying market of shipping is going through a once in a lifetime supply chain issue making for bidding wars for containers to get on ships and the companies to drive more revenue from that.  If you listen to the earnings calls you can hear their CEO's and CFO's discuss the issues.  You can actually graph the correlation with shipping if you look at things like the Baltic Index or want to track shipping freight costs here [https://fbx.freightos.com/](https://fbx.freightos.com/)  The inputs to shipping costs (fuel, labor, etc) have not increased substantially which you can see in a historical chart of operating expenses and COGS, thus with increased revenue they get higher EPS which has been on a tear lately.  Many of the freight analysts I've heard have suggested after Chinese New Year in February they believe pressure will start to relieve as supply chain issues normalize.\n\nSo in my mind, the shipping industry is reaping temporary rewards of a bidding war in ocean freight which is driving their top line growth, but I don't think that will last as supply chain issues will inevitably get sorted out over time, thus bringing down ZIM/MATX revenue.  At least that's my operating thesis on the trade.\n\nIn my view, the major risks from the short side are whether ZIM/MATX use their larger than normal cash reserves from their windfall profits to keep on doing buybacks (MATX has started) or figure out a great ROI way to deploy that capital to continue earnings growth."

     "Seems a bit questionable\n\nWouldn\u2019t surface-level stuff like company cashflows already be priced in? As you said, \u201cthat\u2019s what big name institutions are gonna look at right off the rip\u201d. Those big name institutions have exponentially more capital than you and I. Many of them also have high-level supercomputers. By the time you and I are looking at large company\u2019s cashflows, those cashflows have already been looked at and invested upon by big funds. As a result, companies with good cashflows will have a share price reflecting that information\n\nThe same argument applies to investments in \u201ccompanies that will always be around\u201d. Again, you even acknowledge that \u201cbig investment companies know this and will always buy these stocks no matter what\u201d. When they buy those stocks, the price goes up. End result: the information is already priced in \n\nAnd the same argument applies **again** to your technical analysis. **Again**, you explicitly say that \u201cheavy/smart/big investors load in when the stock hits the SMA\u201d. When they throw their billions of $ in capital into the pit, the price moves. By the time us average joes get a piece, *it\u2019s already priced in*\n\nIt\u2019s true that markets tend to grow over time. So we can still profit on securities despite so much already being priced in. But you used the word \u201cprint\u201d, and I doubt that\u2019s likely to apply. You\u2019re trading solely based on basic info that, as you acknowledged multiple times, the whales are already aware of. How could a strategy like that be consistently \u201cprinting\u201d? Modest profit, sure. We live in the world\u2019s best economy; you have to trade like shit to not modestly profit over the long term. But \u201cprint\u201d? I\u2019m very skeptical \n\nI will admit, I am new to finance. I\u2019m open to whatever criticism you may have"

I don't know that any of my patients that take Viagra for lifestyle reasons take brand name V, either;  most take generic as the price is about 90% cheaper, or have switched to tadalafil (longer half-life means larger window for boom-boom time).  Obviously when you get into Revatio for pulmonary hypertension, the upcharge is a bit more in the clinical sphere, but still, generics abound.  I think the returns on this have been diminishing quite a bit already, I don't know that any new pharma generics will drive down the price that much more (around $10-12/mo for 30tab of 20mg through GoodRx).\n\nDisclosure: I hold no positions in PFE, no options nor longs. \n\nI'm a better clinician than I am a market person, so do with this info what you will.   If I misunderstood, then just ignore my post."

No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia.

     ">Gain comparison. Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%.\n\nYou can't look at two entities who happen to produce similar products, disregard everything else they're doing, and simply compare market cap growth.\n\nThe COVID vaccine accounts for a vast majority of Moderna's revenue - [in Q2 2021, it accounted for $4.2 billion of its $4.4 billion revenue](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial).\n\nIn contrast, during the same period, [Pfizer's vaccine accounted for $8 billion of its $19 billion revenue.](https://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nSo you're comparing the 253% growth of Moderna, which has very little revenue if it weren't for the COVID vaccine, to 31% growth of Pfizer, which would've done just fine with all its other revenue streams. In other words, Moderna stock exploded because they went from having some $60 millions in quarterly revenue to $4.4 billion, while Pfizer's went from some $9 billion to $19 billion, and the stock price growth reflects that.\n\nNot saying any of your other points are wrong, just that this comparison isn't valid."

IV will probably cool off for the next several weeks then rise gradually going into earnings so I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have quite the same result buying calls and I certainly wouldn\u2019t play weeklies with calls on this one rn.

     "One reason we can speculate the volatility of Hershey's might go up, is that they were caught buying cocoa beans on options exchanges, trying to avoid buying from the facility set up with anti-child labor protections.\n\n1. Hershey's options purchases of cocoa beans send beans up higher 6 days ago: https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/11/22/cocoa-futures-skyrocket-thanks-reported-hersheys-trade\n\n2. None of this gets much notice, including when West African countries busted Hershey & threatened reprisal, except after the dispute is \"settled\" and Hershey's stock price actually ROSE for that reason 3 days ago: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-iac/interactive-ford-eastman-kodak-more.html. So far, Hershey's just sees net gains due to its bad behavior.\n\n3. But in the past couple of days, Hershey's child-labor cocoa beans buys is starting to get some attention. See this NBC article yesterday: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/the-war-on-cocoa-hershey-co-accused-of-not-upholding-sustainability-efforts-in-west-africa/2421880/\n\nPersonally, I think Hershey's needs to be called out for its child labor cocoa beans buys, because it's not the first time it's been caught trying to undercut basic price controls in what is already one of the lowest-wage regions of the world, with or without child labor.  They also were called out for child labor chocolate in 2019:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/\n\nThis is literally just brutally greedy behavior, because it's practically impossible to find labor that is cheaper than what these workers already make with the price controls. \n\nI'm seriously considering attacking Hershey stock on one of Reddit's forums, because they have been continuing to engage in this behavior. Stockholder activism is sometimes the only way these companies change abuses. \n\ntldr; Hershey's has been secret-buying child labor cocoa beans on options exchanges this year, and has been a problem behind child labor cocoa for years, in fact. It stock deserves some volatility right about now. This is a heads up I might post a rant about Hershey's behavior, asking for stockholder activism next week."

     "I work in the Healthcare field and was quiet involved with the vaccine allocation in my area. Moderna/Pfizer have been used interchangeably based on what is available. Like you said it's a 2 part injection process.\n\nWorking in the hospital, we are trying to find a way to be able to inject admitted patients and ensure they come back for the 2nd dose (as of now its just staff only). I am more than certain almost every health institution has the same concerns. The vaccine we do have are highly coveted and waste is not an option.\n\n The JNJ vaccine will help cease those concerns. One shot, as of now, and that's it. It has a 90% efficacy, which is slightly lower than both Moderna/Pfizer; however, the one injection part is major. I can see the JNJ one being used at many hospitals and even in clinics.\n\nThere are risks: not sure it's effectiveness against other variants. Moderna came out and said it's vaccine isn't as effective toward the South American variant and may require a 3rd injection. Moderna has a higher efficacy than JNJ, so I'd assume JNJ is less effective toward the newer strains. I do think Moderna/Pfizer will be the main cogs overall, but JNJ will be pumping them out too based upon availability and ease. It will be the best way to get a large portion of the population vaccinated. \n\nThe real winner will be the company who can make a 1x dose w/ a >95% efficacy. The CEO of Moderna said he thinks it may be an annual injection, like a flu shot. This is all TBD, but the company who can come up with an 1x shot with strong antibodies, that's the longterm play"

  "Text": "b'Im having trouble wrapping my head around writing covered calls. From the basic knowledge I have, you would write a covered call if your sentiment is neutral to negative  meaning you would youre your stock price to remain at the money or below. However, when I look at option chains and I see the premiums, etc. Im not understanding why anyone would do ITM/ATM calls. Below is a situation of what Im not understanding:\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIll use Pfizer (PFE) as the stock. Today is 7/8/2016 and currently, the stock price is trading at $35.85. The Jul 15, 2016 (7 days to expiration) option call chain is priced as such:\\n\\nMoney | Premium | Strike\\n------|---------|-------\\nITM | $1.41 | 34.50\\nITM | $0.93 | 35.00\\nATM | $0.51 | 35.50\\nOTM | $0.20 | 36.00\\nOTM | $0.06 | 36.60\\n\\nWhy would anyone write an ITM or ATM covered call? Wouldnt you basically be assigned right away and you basically lose money?\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf I wrote a 35.00 Strike, I would make the premium, right? So in this instance I would make $0.9'",

     "I think you have a couple of misunderstandings.  A covered call is a bullish strategy.  You want tot he stock to go up.  You will still make money if it stays the same or goes down a little collecting the time decay of the short option, but it is a long delta position.\n\nSecond, even if you sell an ATM or ITM strike, there is still time value left in that option and the person on the other side of the trade isn't going to exercise it since they'd instantly lose that premium.  In your example, of you sold the ATM strike for $0.51, and the counter party immediately exercised it, they's but the stock from you at $35.50, they would have effectively paid $35.50 + $0.51 for it when they could have bought it in the open market for $35.50.  The same logic holds for ITM strikes as long as there is still time value left in the option.\n\nAnother way to think about it is a covered cal is identical to a naked put at the same strike.  Selling an ITM call against long stock is he same as selling a put at the same strike which by definition is OTM.  Why would someone exercise an OTM put when the stock is trading at a higher price?"

     "You will never get assigned right away if you do not open completely ridiculous positions.\n\nIf you write a covered call you want to sell the stocks, you can do that ATM and get the most cash for the option, but you will probably get assigned to deliver once the stock is higher than strike price+premium, I'm more a fan of put options but you can combine those two well to get rid of stocks you never really wanted."
