The company must refund the full purchase price to the plaintiff.\nJune 15, 2023 - 5:11 pm Now share\nThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had \"actual severe defects\". Source: AP\nTesla Model S\nThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had \"actual severe defects\".\n\nBerlin, D\u00fcsseldorf The electric car manufacturer Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered on Monday that Tesla must refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The reason is \"serious defects in driving comfort and safety\", including unwanted braking.\n\nAs far as is known, there is no higher court judgment against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The decision of June 12 has 14 pages and reads like a reckoning with the statements that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making about the quality of his driver assistance systems for years, often under the term \"Autopilot\"."

     "I think tesla is in trouble. They got so big in their early years because the tech in their cars was better than other brands, their electric range was higher than anyone else, and they were the only brand capable of mass producing electric cars to meet demand. This was the reason so many people were overlooking the very clear quality control issues that they have. The most important thing they had to do was solve their QC issues before other brands caught up. However, other brands caught up and tesla still faces terrible QC concerns. This may affect them a lot in the future. \n\nNow, other brands have similar or better technology and driving assistance. Everybody has a big screen, a trend that Tesla started.\n\nOther brands have developed better autonomous systems than Tesla. Mercedes, GM, and Ford are the top now.\n\nOther brands have electric cars that equal or beat Tesla's range and charging speeds.\n\nOther brands are able to produce and develop electric cars at a good rate. It can be argued that brands are still catching up in this sense, but they are most definitely catching up at rapid speed.\n\nThe last current saviour for Tesla is their far superior charging network. This was something that was planned to take ***years*** for other brands to catch up to. However, they are catching up fast. Furthermore, other brands are now gaining access to tesla charging network. This is another nail in the coffin for tesla.\n\nTesla is running out of time to solve their issues. They need to address the issues in their cars before the other brands leave them in the dust. When the other brands have better electric cars that are readily available and affordable, along with good charging networks, tesla will struggle to sell units."

Like a child! lol.\n\nThe number of times Tesla and Elon Musk have been involved in covering up or reducing the seriousness of the issues and problems regarding the public safety and driver safety with his cars on the road probably should be taken into account at some point once enough accidents/deaths have occurred to make the information seem more prevalent, like what is the difference between a transparent company and Tesla?\n\nA transparent company has no secrets."

It\\'s seems too easy for firms to be \"Ethical\" based on ticking some management boxes rather than what they actually do as a business.

     "My 2c:\n\nESG was always about a new way for funds to market themselves, ultimately with the goal of growing their AUM.\n\nIn reality, funds are a 'solved' space. ESG ETFs are majorly identical to regular ETFs, but it makes regular investors 'feel good' which is way to collect funds, and institutional investors are able to boast about their investments.\n\nAm I just making this up?\n\nWell compare ESGU, the ESG etf with 14bn AUM to IVV, the SP500 etf, and look at their historical performance - identical.\n\nLook at their holdings - almost exactly the same.\n\nThe only major stocks they exclude are WMT, PM, BA, LMT, ADI - and all the others are a tiny % of the SP500.\n\nImagine being able to drop a couple of major stocks from what is essentially the SP500 (well 300, they drop the smallest ones) and collecting 14bn - they get to charge a higher expense ratio too.\n\n14bn * 0.15% = 21 million per year\n\nFairly profitable when IVV only charges 0.03% expense ratio, and at $330bn AUM, it collects 99 million per year.\n\n(Also 0.15% expense ratio might not seem much, but it's $1,500 on 1 mil per year. The way I see it while someone with 1mil in stocks can afford $1.5k per year, $1.5k still matters for someone with $1mil net worth, and it's 10% of the current 1.5% SP500 dividend yield)"

This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.\\n\\nFor background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He\\'s convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn\\'t really reacted to the bearish arguments I\\'ve laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as \"robo-taxis\" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors i'",

From his perspective, the option looks like: \n1. Gamble with Tesla and you may 4x/10x and have enough for retirement\n2. Or he can continue with lesser risky investment ~10%  per annum however it *will still be not enough* for his retirement\n\nInstead of trying to explain about option 1 downside, which I believe he should know it is risky but still think it is better than option 2, you should try to think and propose option 3."

     "Obviously the standard answer is index funds, with some bonds at his age, and keeping everything in one stock is crazy. But here are some other things to think about.\n\n- If he's behind on his retirement funding, then that's probably not going to work out for him. Various measures of market valuation still say the overall market is valued pretty highly, and companies like Vanguard are projecting low returns over the next decade. Depending on how far behind he is, that might not be viable.\n\n- Volatile stocks are horrible for people prone to buying high and selling low, but apparently your dad has the cojones to hold on for the long term. TSLA still has to do well but at least he'll reap the benefits if it does.\n\n- TSLA's prospects don't entirely depend on self-driving. Watch the recent Investors Day presentation, most of it was about radically reducing costs while increasing quality and scale. Also check out Sandy Munro's videos, he's an engineer who consults with automobile manufacturers. He's famous for taking apart an early Model 3 and heavily criticizing it; now he raves about how far Tesla is ahead of other manufacturers. And it's not just the car business; they make as many battery cells as they can and sell the extras to power grids. They're even starting up their own lithium refinery.\n\n- Finally, if you talk him out of his TSLA and TSLA goes to the moon then he's going to blame you for keeping him poor, move in with you, and complain about might-have-beens every day."

And then the current P/E ratio is in the 40s so let\u2019s low ball the expectation at 5x today for the next 10ish years. That would mean that Tesla would be nearly a 3T dollar company while also maintaining expectations of high growth to justify the high PE or massive profits and while adding 2.5T dollars into buying the stock. In other words in the next decade it will have to add the entire worth of apple on top of what\u2019s already in it. The practicality alone would make me not bank on it happening, but then you got the troubles brewing with China relations, and all the boomers retiring with their capital fleeing from risky bets, and the increase competition, amongst the 10 other more speculative possible issues that I won\u2019t get into. I haven\u2019t looked into Teslas financials lately but you could def attempt a discounted cash flow or look at bullish projections of earnings and reverse engineer stock price based on if it maintains the PE or whatever. But while I wouldn\u2019t tell him to not invest in Tesla, I definitely would tell him to diversify most of it. Oh also if he averaged up from 130$ it looks like he\u2019s close to break even if not down, but either way just show the math on how quickly it could fall apart if the rug is pulled like a China factory close or calculate what happens when Elon has to use all his billions on Twitter and has to borrow with Tesla at these higher rates when they Barely escaped bankruptcy at low rates."

     "If he plans to hold on until 2030 he will most likely be totally fine. This year is going to be maximum volatility for the immediate future. It's still incredibly risky at his age though. \n\nI rolled over my 401k in 2020 and went heavy into Tesla before the S&P inclusion and still had cash available when they announced the inclusion. Due to that I doubled it instead of just buying index funds since index funds had to buy Tesla. I was up over 250% in about a year, but due to my strategy of not trying to time the market, I went lower than my original investment once it dropped. It's now back above that, but it may be a rough year for Tesla meeting the growth targets. \n\nThe current bear market has hit growth stocks hard. If we get out of the recession, than Tesla will easily rise above it's previous all time high if they keep growth and profitability in line. It's definitely no certain outcome, but their ambitions are sky high and with the vertical integration and extremely low debt overall, they have huge potential for growth this decade. \n\nGrid scale energy storage having endless growth potential, a Tesla compact vehicle, mass production of batteries internally, robotaxis and robotics are all in work for the decade which some of those projects could easily push Tesla into the multi trillion dollar range. \n\nReally, Elon has been the main issue lately for Tesla headwinds, but he was the guy who directed ship to the current valuation."

     "You are thinking about this correctly. It's risky as hell.\n\nI made really good gains betting on Tesla prior to the pandemic. It became a pretty big part of my portfolio but it didn't start that way. Gains got it there. When the pandemic hit I got out, thinking the economy was going to crash. I delayed getting back in when it was clear that it wasn't, because Musk started acting very erratic (or showing his true self) turning off his primary customer base. The cars were getting more and more expensive and the promise of fully self-driving cars and robotaxis seemed further and further away. \n\nI'm back in to some degree because I see some positives in where Tesla is heading now (except the self-driving progress is still unclear) but I'm cautious. I'm in my 50's and I believe in preserving the gains I have and trying to grow them in a balanced way, not being overly aggressive.\n\nTesla has a lot of strengths and advantages in their market, but there is also a shitton of risk. Musk is one of them. Everything relies on him and he is a loose cannon. What if something happens to him tomorrow? The competing car companies are working hard to catch up. Even if everything goes well, their PE does not nearly justify the stock price. They have a long way to go to make that equation work. \n\nYour dad may be right that the stock will shoot up dramatically over the next 3-5 years. Then again, it may not. Who knows? It's a bet, like any other bet. Bets like this should be hedged. Being really greedy tends to bite you in the ass. \n\nI used to work with a guy that was past retirement age but had to still work full time. This was after selling a company he owned. In his case it was because he lost everything to Bernie Madoff. He made a bet and it completely failed. I felt bad for him."

     "The hard truth is that it\u2019s his money and he can invest however he wants with it. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not a fan of Tesla as a company nor am I a fan of Elon. That aside, I would recommend reviewing the company financials (10-K and 10-Q for example), the company leadership, their \u201cmoats\u201d, risks, and their long term strategy amongst other things. I would then recommend he do his own financial analysis looking at free cash flow over his time horizon. If your dad has done this and understands what he\u2019s reading and is still on board for Tesla, then so be it. \n\nBut what you as an individual need to do is to understand how his decisions impact you. You then need to understand what his worst case scenario is and determine what your boundaries are. If the stock crashes and he cannot live off Tesla, are you going to support him? Provide him housing? Elderly care? Pay his bills? Call me heartless but I would not if my parents invested like this without a backup assets to generate cash flow in retirement.  Either way, you need to set your boundaries and expectations with your father. He may be relying on you as his fall back. \n\nOn the flip side, investing in just one company is not inherently bad. If you understand the risks and the company then you can probably get away with it. But, you really really need to understand the business, it\u2019s leadership, risks, the competition, the industry, and all the other ins and outs.

     "Unfortunately this is more common than you think. And most of the time this behavior is coming from a normally functioning adult, who tends to act rationally about anything else. I've heard this story n number of times either from a friend or a friend of a friend and whether its $TSLA or $NVDA, the rationale tends to be the same. \"I'm financially behind my peers, I need to take on bigger risk to compensate.\"\n\nWhat's even more unfortunate is that these are the people (especially in his life stage) who've probably been fiscally responsible up until this point. The funny thing about investing is that you only truly understand your risk tolerance once you've blown up. Most successful investors and traders advocate this as a necessary learning experience. In the case of your dad, I don't blame him if this is his situation but the fallout will be brutal. \n\nThe only thing I can suggest is for him to reduce his overall exposure by selling half of his shares, and putting 10% into leaps. That way, if he's ultra-bullish he can capitalize on the upside.\n\nThis is an extreme opinion, but if you're up for the challenge maybe this will change his mind.\n\nYour dad probably knows this, but tell him how in every bubble the vast majority of investors lose money. That's basically what makes it a bubble, right? If a lot of people didn't lose a lot of money than it wouldn't be a bubble. Conversely, there are always the few people who make it out with their shirts and they're most likely either 1. connected 2. rich 3. an expert (someone who was an industry expert before the bubble happened) 4. an institution, or 5. extremely lucky. Now ask your dad, is he any of these? No. He is exactly the prototype of the \"retail\" investor who loses their shirt from this bubble. It's not the well-connected VC folks who invested in $TSLA back in 2009. It's not the wealthy ultra high-net worth individuals who's money is managed by a family office. It's not the battery scientist who's been tinkering with EV technology since 2012. It's not BlackRock who sees and hears everything. And it's not the lucky guy who bought $TSLA in 2014 because he thought the cars looked cool.\n\nYou can't just think of the wealth destruction of a bubble popping when $TSLA goes from $400 to $100. Look at the recent reports, the amount of $$$ retail is plowing directly into $TSLA the past 3 months is staggering. THESE are the \"chumps\" who become the bag-holders. The true wealth destruction is when $TSLA goes from $100 to $200, sucks in as many retail investors as it can so the folks from #1 - #5 can offload their positions, then goes down to $50. Right now is exactly when retail is left holding the bag. There's a really good reason why most bubble charts look the same. Whether it's $TSLA, $CSCO back in the dot-com bubble, Bitcoin, or the Dutch East India in the 1700s. At the end of the day, speculation and bubbles are driven by human greed that never changes. What also never changes is that that only the minority end up winning big (category #1-#5) and they're the ones cashing out during the initial plunge and the initial bull trap recovery. It's always the normal investors who missed out on the initial gravy train that jump in too late with eager eyes and end up getting hurt the most."

I know this is off topic but what made you initially invest  in these companies to begin with, was it the hype at the time or did you actually believe that these companies would succeed and make great products? I guess I have a similar story where I was gonna buy a whole Bitcoin back in June of 2020 when it was roughly 5k but backed out because I thought it was too risky lol. I also wanted to buy a thousand dollars worth of Tesla back in March 2020 when it was roughly 300 bucks a share (pre split). I decided not to invest in it because someone who I had known who had a lot of experience investing in the stock market told me not to. This was also my very first time putting any money in the stock market, and I was extremely hesitant about putting my hard earned money into something I essentially thought was a gamble.If anything this experience taught me that you just gotta follow your gut when it comes to everything in life including investing lol."

The fifth such cut in Teslas largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.\\n\\nSome analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Teslas industry-leading profit margins could be at risk.

Economy of scale and all that. \n\nCurious to see how other manufacturers react, especially the ones who are currently making EVs at a loss. \n\nDo they lower prices too to try and compete, making an even bigger loss or rely on their own brand loyalty for people to pay their asking price to minimise their losses. \n\nMust be hard for the likes of Ford and VW who are making good decisions and relatively close to being profitable on EVs  just to see Tesla lower prices whenever it suits them to put the pressure on."

     "Seems to lack context. Their highest volume product is the Model Y and this price cut brings the price back down to where it was in January.\n\nThey cut prices in January, raised prices, and then cut prices back down to the same amount.\n\nThe Model Y Long Range is still priced above the 2021 pricing. The Model 3 standard range also received price cuts, but it is still above its 2021 pricing too. Model S/X pricing still above 2021 pricing too, by about $5,000.\n\nAs for margins, we will see. There will be some margin compression as guided by their CFO. Remember, it isn't just prices, it's cost of goods sold too. The costs of materials has been dropping a lot as the supply chains are also getting back to \"normal.\" Plus, Tesla's scale is much higher than 2021 with better fixed cost absorption. Their new factories in Austin and Berlin have achieved 4,000/week and 5,000/week peak rates respectively, which is going to help with margins. Furthermore, the IRA tax credits provide production tax credits that dramatically lower the cost of battery cell production.\n\nSo we will see at their earnings release how all this shakes out in terms of margins - it is quite a fluid situation with a lot of different variables.\n\nNote that in the US, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Nissan Ariya all do not have any IRA EV tax credit. The Ford Mach-E is getting cut in half to $3,750. All of these have pricing problems.\n\nFord Mach-E California Route 1: $57,995 - $3,750 = $54,245\n\nHyundai Ioniq 5 SE AWD: $50,335 - $0 = $50,335\n\nKia EV6 Wind (e-AWD): $52,600 - $0 = $52,600\n\nNissan Ariya Engage+ e-4ORCE AWD: $51,190 - $0 = $51,190\n\nTesla Model Y Long Range AWD: $52,990 - $7,500 = $45,490\n\nMany dealerships are still asking for mark ups over MSRP, while you don't get that with Tesla. Also, the Model Y is a much larger vehicle in terms of interior cargo space, especially compared to the Ioniq 5 and has access to the best DCFC network in the US.  It's 70 mph range is also substantially higher.\n\nWinter range, tested by Bjorn at 75 mph:\n\nFord Mach-E LR AWD: 163 miles\n\nHyundai Ioniq 5 AWD (summer, so higher than winter range): 180 miles\n\nKia EV6 AWD: 170 miles\n\nNissan Ariya 87 kWh FWD: 181 miles, AWD version should be about 10% less.\n\nModel Y LR AWD: 203 miles\n\nAs a result, Tesla is squeezing the competition with price cuts and will continue to ride their cost curve down. Everyone else is going to have to respond, or just continue to see very low marketshare. Ford has had to cut prices, and will likely have to cut them again. Things are so dire in China for the Mach-E that Ford has cut the starting price down to 209,900 yuan, or \\~$30,500."

This of course is all in support of taxing charging sessions by kWh or total sale. You know it is coming and the politicians want their share.  \n  \nThe issue for Tesla owners is some very tight stations might be even worse off with waiting times. Now Tesla could use a color coding system to designate which chargers work with CCS or SC and even a third color denoting both.\n  \nHowever regardless of the silly title, Tesla doesn't face an ultimatum.

No real info on how fast they are ramping up 4680 cells (back in 2020 they were talking as if it will be mass production mode in 2022 changing the battery landscape). Plus continuous delay of their products launched previously. Biggest of all the small car launch is also delayed big time. they will have to get the Mexico GF built before that can be started and I am not convinced they will directly jump to new platform with new GF. Probably 2026 or later. Plus I dont even have to mention so called \"FSD\". its a L2 system that is no where close to being called FSD. \n\nIts already valued like a tech company. Let us see how they navigate various issues as they sell more and more cars. They had to reduce price big time to get demand and I am not convinced even that is long term sustainable as even after discount, its still an expensive car. They need a cheaper car for next level of growth and that is not happening in the near future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would rather bet on BYD than TSLA at this point."

Performance in China will be make or break for Tesla. They've been doing well lately, but competition is strong and they've had to cut prices significantly. It won't be easy to keep matching the prices of Chinese brands in the future. Keep an eye on further developments in China and don't underestimate chinese nationalism when it comes to brand preference (the same is true for the EU btw: european brands will always have the home advantage there).\nPersonally, I'm long on BYD.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-electric-car-drive-led-by-byd-leaves-global-brands-behind-2023-04-17/"

     "There are many factors as to why Tesla is doing so well, and I personally think many traders are missing when they are discussing about Tesla stock. Below are just some points as to why I am buy a lot of this stock.\n\n1. Tesla was the company that popularize EV, and it has a good head start because ford/GM decided to abandon the first ev project. They were the true pioneer, but for some reason quit.\n2. Tesla tax break in the US which help reduce the cost of the car. At the moment, Tesla is is the cheapest EV car you can buy due to government's subsidies and the current relation automakers have with the auto sellers. Additionally, when you compound this with the cost of markup, it is very easy to understand why you are seeing more Tesla. Last summer, I wanted to buy a Mach E, but when I wen to the dealer, there was a $15,000 markup on top of MSRP. My family ended up getting another Tesla (model y) because it is the value. Have you tried purchasing the EV F-150 that you can find? There is a motherfucking $30,000 markup at the dealer. it's insane.\n3. As for build quality, I can tell you that after owning 3 Tesla, it is a hit or miss with this company. However, I can also say the same for other car makers. You are going to run into defects. Nevertheless, do you know why many people still prefer a Tesla over other brands? Tesla will fix all of the defects of their cars for free--3 years warranty--and give you a $100/day uber allowance for the trouble. Even if you are out of warranty, they will fix some defects for free too. For the simple stuff, they will send someone out to wherever your car is to fix the problem. In contrast with other automakers/dealers, they nickel and dime you for everything that they can. \n4. Tesla are amazing car to drive. The handling and speed is the best bang for the buck you can get. There is something about the car that feel good. \n5. Tesla doesn't just sell car. Tesla sale insurance, power(supercharger), car repair, and charging format. It is cheaper to insure a Tesla through their insurance than to another insurance. They have the most charging stations in the world which is one of the reasons why government are asking them to share their charging station with other makers. Tesla is agreeing with this because there is current a format war for charging adapters. There are currently 4-5 format (think USB vs thunderbolt plug), and it looks like Tesla is winning even though there are faster and better charging adapters. The best and cheapest place to repair your Tesla is at a Tesla location. In short, they are the monopoly for their car.\n6. It doesn't help that the current charging station for other car companies are poorly maintained and frustrating to use. Tesla makes it very easy to charge at their station. Get in and get out. Plus they are always functioning because people are always using them. \n7. The current sentiment for the Asian culture (Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, etc.) is Tesla is a luxury brand car--beating Lexus. Ever noticed how almost every middle class Vietnamese or Chinese drive an RX 300 series? Well, now they are driving Tesla. This is the reason why you are seeing such huge spike in Tesla sales in China. \n8. The company is purely data driving. Ask anyone who has worked for Tesla and they can tell you that the company only car about data and nothing else. Everything they do is data driven. The ups and downs of Tesla price is driven by this data. They know exactly how much people are willing to pay for the car. For example, the recent price cut is mainly to kill Tesla competitors. In a time when Tesla is making $20,000+ profit per car, its competitors are losing $20,000 to $100,000 per car. This is insane numbers. You don't think so? Wait until this week earning for Tesla's competitors, and look at how Ford is losing money per ev car. \n9. Elon Musk is a dick, but you cannot argue against his killer instinct when it comes to how he run Tesla. The decision to dump millions into building charging station for free and giving early adopters free charging for the life of the car was insane at the time. However, in hindsight, those were some killer instinct decision making that made Tesla what it is today. With that said, Elon has so much control over Tesla that he can make any changes based on the data the company is collection without the board approval. \n\nOverall, there are many reasons as to why Tesla will do well in the future and for Cathie Wood's high valuation. I know she sounds like a crazy lady sometime, but from my perspective, Tesla is building itself up to be a monopoly for EV car. This is similar to the how people adopted the Apple's ecosystem. Tesla reach the tipping point of adopters into its ecosystem, it will be interesting to see what kind of company it will be. If you think all Tesla is selling is car, I think you are missing the bigger picture. Tesla major product right now is car. However, in the next 5 years, I'm more incline to believe it will be the seller of energy (think gas for your car) than just a car company due to it winning the format war. \n\nThe only way for Tesla to lose this format war is for the majority of automaker to come together and agree upon one format for charging. However, as someone who have family members working for Hyundai, Ford, and Toyota, it is unlikely this will happen. These guys all think they can take on the EV giant because they are a legacy automaker. To me, we are looking at a transition from blackberry to Iphone, but in the form of cars. \n\nNevertheless, this isn't  to say I am a full bull of Tesla. I love the fact that people are constantly shitting on the company. This constant shitting on Tesla has created many opportunities to buy in and create incredible volatility. Trading Tesla is the most fun I have every week."

     "TLDR: All EV companies share the same benefits listed below, not just Tesla, and it is a benefit of being a new EV company vs. a legacy ICE company.\n\n\"just another car company\" people know nothing about the car industry. The legacy automakers don't make their car parts, they design them and then assemble the cars. They outsource all of the parts to subcontractors who take all of the profit margins and none of the risks. Tesla meanwhile is almost completely vertically integrated and keeps all of the profit margins for the car they produce. This means they can sell far fewer cars and make far more profit.\n\nThe second thing is that legacy automakers are legally not allowed to sell direct to consumer and have exclusive contracts with dealerships to sell their cars. This further puts constraints on their profit margins and limits their ability to adapt to market forces. Look at the last two years, dealerships were selling cars far above MSRP and the legacy automakers saw none of those additional profits. Tesla and the other new automakers have found ways around the laws against direct to consumer sales so are able to keep all of the profit margins from dealerships and get to benefit from all of the market forces that drive up prices. This is the eternal weakness of all franchise models dialed up to 11.\n\nThird, EV cars have a completely different supply chain compared to ICE cars and it is very expensive to set up, but the incremental costs are very low for manufacturing. As compared to ICE cars where most of the cost per car is in the incremental costs. Most of this is in the complexity of ICE cars compared to EVs which translates into large part counts and large labor costs for ICE cars vs. EVs. This will make it easier to fully automate an EV plant where you'll always need high skill, highly paid employees for an ICE factory.\n\nFinally, EVs companies don't have union expenses, pension expenses, legacy employer costs, etc. This adds a lot of overhead that legacy automakers have to pay that brand new companies don't. It is easier to be a 20 year old company vs. a 100+ year old company."

More importantly though, if you look at profits software is ~20% of Tesla's total (gross) profits."

The bet would be that TSLA can keep their lead, but they would need to introduce more vehicle models to get to 10M units a year. \n\nBesides personal animus for Musk, the main bear case is that TSLA will either began to significantly lose market shares to competitors or they will lose their appeal as they become more commonplace."

Tesla will continue to be the largest EV manufacturer for the next few years at least but its operating margins are starting to diminish because of competition. Another big challenge for Tesla is that its giga Shanghai factory is facing stronger competition from Chinese EV makers the like of Nio , Li and xpev. Tesla is able to export good number of cars from Shanghai factory to Europe and the U.S. but the Chinese trend is going to make it harder for Tesla. Already Nio is expanding globally and have penetrated Norway market and is about to enter Germany. I still expect Tesla to be strong but slowly its dominance will shrink. This may mean its stock is not as attractive as it was, like 1-2 years ago. I am little bearish but could be wrong"

When news about Teslas crashing because of distracted drivers came out, my dad and I talked about how completely misleading it was to market their vehicles as being \"self-driving\" or having an \"autopilot\" feature. Sure, [from an engineering perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot) \"autopilot\" technically means some level of human piloting is still occurring...but to the average layperson, the word colloquially implies that the machine doesn't need to be supervised (i.e. saying that someone is \"operating on autopilot\" means that they're distracted).\n\nEven if the engineers had wanted to call it an \"autopilot\" feature, the marketers and lawyers should have stepped in and overridden them. I normally argue that consumers should be responsible for understanding what they're buying, but I can absolutely understand why someone would purchase a car and assume that the car was totally autonomous. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them assumed that the instructions that did warn them to pay attention to the road were just legalese to cover Tesla's ass instead of serious warnings."

Their stock has grown rapidly the last 4 years to as high as $407.36 a share and recently dropped as low as $108 and now it's back to $198. It is the biggest or close to the biggest electric vehicle company in the world and easily the biggest in the US controlling a large share of an expanding market and they seem to do well in most quarterly earnings reports. That alone would seem to give them a pretty good valuation. \\n\\nBut is their value inflated even at its current price? What do experienced investors think. Thanks\"",

You could say the same of the market in general with the  on-and-off bull market pushes and resistance from retail investors. The market in general has been at odds with economic data, inflation, lackluster earnings, etc. \n\nThat being said, if you're looking at long-term value, there's substantial data, information and positive outlook for Tesla's growth that would support it being a much higher value in the future.\n\nPersonally, I've owned Tesla stock and traded options on it since 2016. It can be a little volatile at times and overly-reactive to news, but there's a reason its one of the most popular stocks out there."

I\u2019m personally waiting until it drops to $140 or so. I have no idea if this will happen or not. When I look at the stock price history over max time, it looks kinda crazy. There\u2019s no steady, linear growth. It looks like it exponentially grew, then dropped and now is coming back up. Like a bad EKG. Hard to say what the future holds, or what the next \u201csale price\u201d will be, if there is one coming at all. My own investing strategy (I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing!) is to not buy more of the same stock unless it\u2019s below what I paid originally. I\u2019m willing to go a little over on this one because I think it\u2019s a good product, and I\u2019m seeing more and more of the cars on the road. I\u2019m in this for the long haul though. Everything I\u2019m buying now I\u2019m keeping 10-30 years, so I\u2019m assuming/hoping it will be a solid investment by then (?)"

When I look at Tesla I don't see what it's value is I see where the trends are, and at this point why bet against them? You could and just become canon fodder or you could just ride the wave with it.

But to switch the storyline into thinking they\u2019ll do well in cars is far from certain. \n\nIt\u2019s as if their beloved American Express company shifted over time to be more of an entertainment business than a credit card company and then exclaiming they\u2019ll destroy Disney. Maybe. But also maybe not."

They have only started selling premium EV's and they pale in comparison to Tesla sales.\n\nTheir best selling vehicles are almost half the price of a Tesla Model 3 or Y.\n\nAs to BYD's profitability, he's including hybrids as well and hybrids are more profitable than EV's currently.\n\nI like BYD a lot and own shares, too. They're a great company and clearly know what they are doing. IMO, they are going to be the 2nd largest auto company in the world by 2030. Tesla needs to address the market with a cheaper Tesla variant priced around $22-25k in China if they want to increase vehicle unit sales there. For the United States, they probably won't need that variant for the next few years because the average vehicle selling price in the U.S. is much higher. They don't want to cannibalize their Tesla Model 3 or Y sales by pushing a cheaper variant too early."

It's the same story in other places like the EU (where they're heavily loyal to European automakers) and Japan (where there's barely any American vehicles). Most countries where a major global automaker are headquartered have a very strong \"buy local\" attitude when it comes to automobiles that helps protect them from foreign competition, it's not like the US where plenty of people will buy cars from European, Korean, and Japanese automakers without a second thought.\n\nThe fact that Tesla has gained as strong of a foothold in China, Europe, and other countries with strong \"buy local\" attitudes only shows just how strong of a company that Tesla is that it can overcome that obstacle. GM by contrast abandoned the European market place because it was too hard to compete in as a foreign automaker."

If he chooses one day to go all in (which is very much a strong possibility) all foreing investments in China from will be worthless. You litterally cant own chinese equity as a foreinger, you purchase notes of promises which shell corporations hold for you.You have no rights as a foreinger, accounting standards are awful, capital controls remove the true information in pricing.I truly thought Mr Munger would think all of this smells of fraud or at least fishy, try and ask Russian investors how their investments has been doing, even if they had some fine returns intially."

In segments where Tesla and BYD compete head to head, Tesla outsells BYD - the Model 3 and Y way outsell the BYD Seal, Han, and Tang in the \u00a5200-\u00a5300k price range (and this is on BUD\u2019s home turf, it barely exists outside of China and Tesla dominates in US and even Europe).

The recall includes 362,758 vehicles.\\n\\nThe FSD Beta system may cause crashes by allowing the affected vehicles to: act unsafe around intersections, such as traveling straight through an intersection while in a turn-only lane, entering a stop sign-controlled intersection without coming to a complete stop, or proceeding into an intersection during a steady yellow traffic signal without due caution, according to the notice on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\\n\\nThe FSD Beta system may also have trouble responding appropriately to changes in posted speed limits, the notice said.\\n\\nThe group of affected vehicles included the following'",

     "Posted in the daily thread too but all the real info is in the NHTSA report:\n\n[https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V085-3451.PDF](https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V085-3451.PDF)\n\nMy hot take: Sounds like there isn't any immediate danger to Tesla or FSD but NHTSA is now taking a stance that instructing drivers to remain vigilant isn't always sufficient to make the software safe. They might not be satisfied that the OTA update actually solves all of the problems they've identified. And this is connected with the ongoing investigation, so they may come up with additional demands.\n\nThese are the specific issues listed in the report:\n\n>1) traveling or turning through certain intersections during a stale yellow traffic light;\n\nSounds like FSD could be easily updated to be more conservative in its timing of yellow lights.\n\n>2) the perceived duration of the vehicle\u2019s static position at certain intersections with a stop sign, particularly when the intersection is clear of any other road users;\n\nBased on the phrasing it sounds like FSD just needs to be more conservative about rolling stops. But if it turns out NHTSA is concerned that FSD on rare occasion still [runs through stops entirely](https://youtu.be/2mYe-629e1o?t=1270), it'll be difficult to conclusively resolve this any time soon.\n\n>3) adjusting vehicle speed while traveling through certain variable speed zones, based on detected speed limit signage and/or the vehicle's speed offset setting that is adjusted by the driver; and\n\nAgain sounds like FSD can just be made a little more conservative with a simple update.\n\n>4) negotiating a lane change out of certain turn-only lanes to continue traveling straight\n\nThis might also be a more difficult problem to conclusively resolve because FSD sometimes seems to get confused about what type of lane it is even in. I've seen videos with stuff like driving on diagonal white stripes or using bus lanes."

I\u2019ve seen more objective journalism from the CCP. Here\u2019s what was left out, which tells the full story:\n\n> Tesla is voluntarily recalling 362,758 vehicles equipped with the company\u2019s experimental driver-assistance software [\u2026] Tesla will deliver an over-the-air software update to cars to address the issues, the recall notice said.\n\n> CEO Elon Musk and Tesla fans have objected to the use of the term \u201crecall\u201d to describe safety defects or issues that can be fixed with a software update delivered over wireless internet. On Thursday, he wrote on Twitter, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d\n\n> NHTSA and Tesla communications say [FSD] is something much simpler: a \u201cSAE level 2 driver support feature that can provide steering and braking/acceleration support to the driver under certain operating limitations.\u201d\n\n> The safety recall report notes, \u201cthe driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene (e.g., steer, brake or accelerate) as needed to maintain safe operation of the vehicle.\u201d"

Margin pressure is the biggest threat to the Tesla bull narrative. Tesla has big efficiencies and made timely investments that other competitors don\u2019t have/didn\u2019t make, so higher margins now aren\u2019t pure vapor - there\u2019s a reason for it.

Once the  factories of European car makers get setup for large volumes of EVs, there is no stopping.

Only then will you be able to stomach 50% drops in the red and still hold because you understand the true value and potential. You need to understand how the stock price is affected by all of those things, otherwise you will never know when to buy, sell, or hold. If you have a thesis, you will know when to buy or sell. If you don't, you will be filled with anxiety and doubt. It's just gambling.\n\nIf you don't feel confident in your decisions as an investor, stick to ETFs until you have a deep understanding of a company.\n\nSincerely, Tesla investor since 2015."

Buy more, Gamble, Win big. If it goes down just keep buying more (dollar cost average) until you are ready to retire or at least close enough to avoid risk. Diversification is fine for older folks and people who are scared of gambling but look at the people who stayed in AAPL the last 10 years. Tesla will be a roller coaster but I feel its products are so so profitable compared to any other automaker with fewer long term liabilities. If you want to get rich, find a winner and stick with it, even double down on it. I know this is not popular advice here and its gambly but too many pull money out of winning stocks and invest it in safe but mediocre alternatives. If you can afford it, TESLA is a fine stock to bet the house on. It went crazy high, came back down and will probably to crazy high again at some point. Just enjoy the ride. \n\nSo Im telling you to gamble. But look at the future. The cybertruck and freight business will bring huge profits, automated cars and taxis will bring huge profits, ongoing subscriptions will bring huge profits. Tesla is not just building nice cars, its a massive robot factory too. Musk is a genius and if you can afford to gamble, he is about the best bet out there right now (in my biased but humble opinion). Disclosure:  I'm long on TSLA and will be for at least the next 10 years.\n\nSome other things to consider: if you sell and this is in a taxable account, make sure you allow for a big tax bill - preferably offset the gains against other losses if you have them."

Incidentally, I got into Tesla December 16th because those same indicators all showed over sold. There's about an 80% accuracy of reversal or continuation of trend. I'm my case, yes, it did continue down, I was down about 20% which was killing me, but my son kept encouraging me and I did have ultimate faith in my charts. I sold yesterday morning. I was watching pre market for a big dump and it didn't so I held until open and after considering I felt good about the 17% overall gain, (and I'm a swing trader) and the price was dropping. There's no emotion, I hit sell. \nYou are only down 6% from there but it's your call and it should be based on your investment style. I have no doubt TSLA will be higher.

Stock went down, i saw red for weeks. Took a year to get some profit again and sold right away. It was not much, but that's my own fault for beeing greedy. Lesson learned, i thought, because it happend again. But this time it wasn't a stock. It was a coin, the one with the dog on it. Again, put in thousands. It went up for several weeks, then Mr Musk went on a late night show, i was ready for it, this is the moment it will shoot up 1000%. Up to this point, i could cash out and be happy, but i was greedy. Coin went down HARD. And after a few days of seeing it go down, i just sold. Scared of the red number that will come. Took a small profit instead of a very big one. That was really when it happend. I learned from it. After that, i did not get greedy anymore. Had 2 big gains since then.\n\nTldr: Better safe than sorry. You either have profit or the unknown."

When everyone first starts they usually say \"wow, I can make money just off my phone\",  the Beginner's luck can take you up up amd away. But then comes the fall. Knowing or un-knowingly people make the stock market their gambling machine. \n\nMy advise to you is to make the stock market your learning machine first and then learn to use your knowledge to make money. Without overwhelming you here are a few things you can focus on:\n1.) Learn why a stock is good for you to trade. Don't just get in because you overheard someone's opinion.\n2.) Learn some risk management. Risk management is King, and never forget that. Risk management is one of the fundamental building blocks to trading/investing/entrepreneurship that is kept regardless of how much experience you gain.\n3.) Don't be so worried about strategies. Find one strategy focus on it and then with experience, you'll learn what you like, dislike, and can improve on.\n\nGood luck on your journey."

I'm sure everyone is happy that he's making another huge profit while the rest of us are left holding the bag. But at least he keeps sending out those funny tweets, right?\n\nI mean, who needs a successful business when you can have fun on Twitter? I'm sure all the Tesla shareholders are thrilled that Musk's personal Twitter habits are being paid for by their investments. Even if he wasn't being sarcastic, it's another reminder that you can't believe anything Musk says, and you should never use his tweets as investment advice.\n\nSo, if you still have Tesla shares, just remember that the market can stay crazy longer than you can stay solvent. Don't let Musk's tricks bring you down. Keep your shares and wait it out. He might tweet something that makes the stock go up again. Don't count on it, though."

People whining about Elon on twitter and reddit who bought at the top do not hold a majority of Tesla's shares. Elon is under no obligation to hold any more shares than his contract states. This is consistent with the behavior of a CEO who is about to step down and name a new CEO, which, to most legitimate observers, is the right decision for the future of the company. He'll remain in orbit and guide high-level stuff but the hard work has been done, he knows it, and he's off to other things. anyone who is making decisions about whether to hold Tesla based on what Elon says on twitter about how many shares he is or is not planning to sell....is an idiot. The share price will probably rocket back up as soon as he passes the baton, and then fall again. That will be a fun week for all the the people who bought at the top and sold at the bottom. The point is, the ride is over for now. The best strategy for virtually anyone holding Tesla, who isn't up six figures already, is to hold tight through the leadership transition and see what happens. I personally don't hold individual Tesla shares....but if i did, I wouldn't be buying, or selling right now."

While GM and Ford have been closing factories for lack of computer chips, Tesla has been racking up record sales every quarter.  In 2022, they sold double the amount of card in 2020.\n\nOne reason is the technology dominance used in Tesla manufacturing.  The other is they own their own supply chain. About the only thing not owned is the battery.  Chip issues impacted Tesla too, but they rewrote the software for the chips they could get. They also could do this because they didn't outsource their programmers, something just about every car company was doing to save money. Their future EV cars will be built on the gas powered car's manufacturing processes.  I could go on and on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Note:  I don't own a Tesla. But I am a programmer for a tech company.

You are aiming for % of total AUTO share because your largest market isn't current EV buyers but getting the guy who wants to purchase an Audi or BMW ICE vehicle.\n\nHyundai IONIQ 6 is a nice vehicle. The problem is it is an unsustainable business model. They are not profitable and sell few units. If the objective was to sell few units and lose money selling a good EV, Hyundai is winning. \n\nChevy Bolt, lol. I love how you use forecasted Chevy Bolt sales for the year versus Tesla current Q1 sales. Why do you not use the forecasted Tesla sales for the year? Instead you want to make it seem close by comparing a quarterly amount versus the yearly amount? FYI, Tesla is expected to do 1.8-1.9 million EV sales for 2023. Chevy Bolt is expected to do 70,000 for 2023. In which way is this close?\n\nTesla is cutting prices because during COVID when everyone had money, they continued to increase the prices of their vehicles. With a looming recession and economic downturn with higher rates, it was unsustainable for Tesla to sell their vehicles at that same price. It's common sense. \n\n\"Cybertruck isn't out yet.\"\n\nLiterally coming out by this year.\n\n\"Model 2 unknown date.\"  \n\n\nExpected to release within the next year or two considering Tom Zhu has said they expect Giga Monterrey to start operating quicker than Shanghai (which only took \\~year to begin manufacturing vehicles.)

     "Anything I\u2019ve seen written about Tesla by an automotive engineer says under the skin the car is miles ahead of any other EV. Most other OEMs are losing tons of money on their EV expansion. Meanwhile Tesla has been minting margins other car manufacturers haven\u2019t seen in decades with an ROE of over 30%. That massive free cash flow is largely being reinvested back into R&D and capex in order to continue to grow faster and stay technologically ahead of everyone else.\n\n2021 sales grew 70% and 2022 grew 50%. Looks like estimates are for 25-30% growth this year off an already high base. \n\nAdd on to this that unlike every other OEM they have almost no advertising or distribution help to achieve these results. So as far as I can see the numbers don\u2019t tell me that Tesla is losing anything. At most you can say they don\u2019t have a 100% monopoly on full size EVs. \n\nFull disclosure: I have no investments in TSLA or any other OEM."

     "Yes, Tesla will continue to lose market share in an industry that is growing exponentially.  It wasn't long ago that the EV market was a niche market that was dominated by Tesla.  Keep in mind that as other players, including legacy car manufacturers, increase their EV offerings, Tesla's market share will continue to erode.  Would you care to make a bet on who the top EV manufacturer will be in ten years?  I would bet the answer is Tesla, although they will likely produce a minority of EVs by then.  Also, in ten years most new cars will be EVs, so we have gone from TSLA being the only significant player in a tiny market five years ago to TSLA still being the top producer in a market that includes most retail automobiles.\n\nBoth things can be true, Tesla can lose market share while still growing at a very high rate because the industry is in its infancy."

I've seen articles saying pre split Tesla falling to $570 could trigger a Margin Call for Musk. I can't find any new articles about Elon margin call post split but I've seen on Reddit that if Tesla falls to $120-$130 post split Musk will be margin called.  If the Judge in the options case rules Musk unduly influenced the board to grant him that $55 Billion Tesla options package by being a controlling shareholder and forces him to give up that $55 Billion in Tesla shares while simultaneously Tesla falls below $120 ( which it is dangerously close to) will Musk effectively bankrupt himself? The previous greatest destruction of wealth in Modern History was Masayoshi Son losing $70 billion in the Dot Com Crash, his only saving grace being a $20 million investment in Ali Baba that swelled to $100 Billion. Do we have a front row seat to the great wealth destruction in history ($100 Billion o\"",

     ">$150 Billion in Margin loans\n\nI'd have to do some digging to find the specifics, but just know the actual $ value of the debt is not $150B, the collateral for the loans is worth (or was worth) $150B.  E.g., he previously had a margin facility laid out for his Twitter acquisition.  It had an initial LTV of 20% or $.20 of credit for every $1 of tesla shares pledged.  Similarly, the margin call threshold was at 35% LTV, which isn't as risky as our typical conception of a margin call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  No.  The banks that made these loan facilities were generally cognizant of the concentration risk and volatility of Tesla as collateral, the dollar value of the loans is small, and Musk still has significant equity at the margin call threshold(s)."

Perhaps the supply chain is more expensive now, but Tesla has scaled up production since then and made improvements along the various production lines.  I would guess margins will be similar to 2020 but at a much higher volume.\n\nThere hasn't been a ton of discussion regarding downstream software sales.  Per Tesla, there are around 285K FSD users currently.  People adding FSD now are either paying $15,000 as a one-time fee, or they are paying a $200/month subscription cost.  More cars sold will mean more FSD users, and more FSD users should mean more FSD data and faster FSD improvements.  More FSD improvements will mean more FSD users, and so on.  There is potentially an FSD flywheel that occurs here, and this is a pure profit generator for Tesla.\n\nThis also probably means Cybertruck pricing may be similar to what was originally suggested when they first announced pricing back in 2019.  They are rightly going to produce the most expensive version first as they ramp up production before moving to the more affordable variants."

There\u2019s a lot of increasing competition in the EV space. Tesla may have had a head-start but they can loose ground if they don\u2019t maintain focus. Teslas are infamous for manufacturing quality being inconsistent, which is something more and more consumers are becoming aware about as they look to buy their next vehicle. \n\nAlso recent PR and controversies regarding their self-driving AI is not a good look for Tesla.\n\nI will never short Tesla, but I\u2019ve sold for a really good profit, and not looking to buy back in anytime soon."

My understanding that Tesla sends out its deliveries numbers this weekend and they are projected to be pretty well, with the price reductions and China ease off. But what has been happening with the stock right now? I played 04/07 205c about two days ago and came out with +10% thankfully, but I expected a way better performance this week especially leading up to the weekend.

With its profit margin they can actually do quite a decent increase in revenue but I doubt it they will multiply it by 4 or 5.

     "Tesla makes 9.2k on average from their cars. The discount for the Model 3 in China alone is around 6k, and even higher for their higher end models.\n\nGiven that most of their money was made in China anyway, that is a 65% margin decline on the Chinese market right here. So Tesla needs to grow 200% in China just to keep earnings even.\n\nAccording to Troy Teslike on Twitter (who is a Tesla bull), the backlog has gone down hugely. My prediction last year was that Tesla would stop growing in H1 2023, with margins declining starting in Q2 2023. I am still sticking to that. The share price correction can get really ugly here if that comes true.\n\nEdit: corrected decline"

They have a ton of headwinds and tailwinds in terms of margins recently, almost impossible to predict what will happen.\n\nTailwinds:\n\n* Bigger economies of scale\n* Negative margins from Berlin/Texas flipping positive\n* Material costs coming back down to 2019 levels\n* FSD NA-wide release one-time deferred revenue recognition\n* FSD NA-wide release probable increase in adoption and definite increase in immediate recognition on new FSD sales\n* Increasing numbers of MIC sales outside of China (more profitable than sales inside China, especially after price cuts)\n* Inventory decrease in EU/NA\n* Larger share of production coming from more efficient factories\n* Continuous cost cutting on manufacturing techniques\n* IRA incentives on ~50% of NA sold units (not technically going to Tesla, but may increase demand and allow price increases)\n* IRA incentives on battery production (may not go into effect until Q2 though)\n* Model S/X being sold outside of NA again\n* No more SBC from CEO compensation plan\n\nHeadwinds:\n\n* 60K units in transit at end of quarter, expected to grow even further for 1-3 more quarters (unlike legacy OEMs, Tesla doesn't recognize a sale until delivery)\n* Discounts during last two weeks of December worldwide\n* Price cuts in China in October and January\n* Declining regulatory credits\n* Soon to be announced new factory investments\n* COVID issues in China factory in December\n* Chinese New Year shutdown in China factory in February\n* Potentially looming recession and high interest rates may slow demand globally\n\nProbably forgot a few, but it's nearly impossible to say anything worthwhile about what the ultimate effect will be. If I had to guess, I'd expect margins to come down a bit during Q4 and even more during Q1 down to, and then start trending upwards again."

They do not need to have 300-500 mile ranges, 95% + of all driving in the US has a round trip distance of under 100 miles.   An ICE with a 100 mile plug in battery is the way to go.  The result is all the torque advantages of an BEV and all of the redundancy of ICE.   \n\nElectric prices are going to spike up, gas will spike up as well and potentially even more.   The best value proposition for the masses will be a plug in electric, as it will allow you to trickle charge at home and if you forget or electricity gets to expensive to offer a cost advantage use gas or use gas on longer trips.  Long trips outside a few coastal corridors with a BEV are not possible.\n\nplug in electrical with ~ 100 mile electric only range, is what will drive the masses.

It is used heavily for trading and people easily FOMO in when sentiment is good or sell, when it is bad. Gains make it a fun and \"cool\" investment, while losses make Elon Musk a horrible CEO. Regardless of if those statements are true or not.\n\nAdditionally it depends heavily on interest rates. Most cash flows to shareholders are expected to come in the future, so changes in interest rates change the present value of those drastically. Distant earnings are uncertain and predictions on how high they will be can change daily, depending on small pieces of information (market share, current sales, brand loyalty, successes/failures in their investments/research/production/autonomous driving...).\n\nOverall a very risky and volatile investment and at least i am not comfortable to say to any degree of certainty what the future cash flows will be and which price might be appropriate for them."

     "As margins compress valuation has to come down. Makes sense that the stock has sold off after the earnings report. However, for those longer term investors this should come at no surprise and make you more bullish. Why? Tesla has been following Ford's early 1900s playbook and will continue to do so as they move down the cost curve to capture market share.\n\n>The real breakthrough came in 1913 with a proprietary innovation, designed by his production managers: the move from batch production to a continuously moving assembly line. The effect of simplification and scale was to move the price of a Model T down to $550 by 1914, when 248,307 of them were sold. By 1917, the price had fallen even further, to $360, with the result that sales soared to 785,432. In 1920, Ford sold 1.25 million Model T's. Compared to 1909, a price reduction of 63 percent -- to almost a third of the original price of the Model T, which was itself a good fifth cheaper than comparable cars -- had resulted in a sixty-sevenfold increase in the number of cars Ford sold.\n\n>Simplifying made the company's cars both easier and cheaper to make. And the price reduction was enormously effective in boosting the whole market as well as Ford's share of it. By 1920, his share had soared to 56 percent, three times larger than that of his nearest rival, General Motors, which was an agglomeration of five different car brands. Ford was by far the most profitable car company in the world, both absolutely -- relative to sales -- and relative to capital employed.\n\n>Even Henry Ford himself was surprised by how much demand responded to the lower price. A price reduction to 35-40 percent of the original price boosted sales by more than 700 times. **The fact is, the relationship between price reduction and demand expansion is asymmetrical. If you cut price by half or more, demand rises exponentially -- by tens or hundreds or thousands of times.**\n\nAny of this look familiar? Tesla is moving from the continuous assembly line to a [deconstructed process as shown here](https://images.app.goo.gl/Mehurhib5Yhr1Ckf6) which will further reduce the cost and time to manufacture. Yes there will be short term pain but the long term story looks bright"

I\u2019ll say the Tesla Semi will only viable by driving from one mega charger to the next else it will be a niche that only viable for day transit and not those cross country overnight delivery trip until the mega charger is up.

The biggest problems are reliability, flexibility and infrastructure.\n\nSee, trucking ain't Uber - it's heavily regulated, the drivers have electronic logbooks and set hours to work with every day. What happens if the truck gets delayed at the shipper for 4-5 hours (quite common in with food distribution centers), has to shut down for 10hrs (logbooks), has to run AC or heat for those 10hrs and doesn't have enough juice left to get to the closest charge station? I guarantee you that Walmart or Amazon won't invest a single dollar to install charging ports at their warehouses.qq\n\nWhat happens if we have a breakdown in the middle of nowhere and the closest Tesla shop is booked for a month ahead? \n\nWill Tesla allow regular mechanics work on their trucks or force us to use only thier network like they do with the cars? This is a first year model - all motor carriers know it's gonna be full of issues and the shops will fill up fast, it will probably be the most unreliable unit on the market.\n\nThere is a niche for such unit - local deliveries for internal company transfer loads (Pepsi to Pepsi or US mail for example) and close to a repair hub. But now that brand new unit costing AT LEAST $125K will have to compete with old trucks the local driver use and can buy under $20k. \n\nMost of us in the industry know that Pepsi and Coca Cola and other big corps are ordering those units as a publicity stunt. And all of us can tell you these trucks will be less profitable that the established diesel units at least for 3-5 years in the best case. Still, we are excited about the technology, it's the way forward, but we have much more profitable options right now.\n\nAdditionally I'd never advertise that I'm using Tesla trucks, cause every freight broker and customer will use this as an excuse to drop their prices. The last thing I want to hear is \"I'll drop your rates, because I know you are now saving on fuel\". And tens of thousands of companies like mine (smaller and larger) are running the show, not Walmart or Pepsi. Those two have 15000 trucks between them (mostly smaller trucks dor local deliveries).

Pay creators\n\n \\- Make Twitter function basically like paypal - like everyone's twitter account is also a paypal/bank account. and can carry negative balances with applied interest rates (interest paid for positive balances, and interest charged for negative balances)\n\n\\- generally - look at the reasons people are clicking/going away from Twitter, and if that reason is something we can/should do at Twitter, let's do it.

It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).\r  \n\r  \nIt operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).\r  \n\r  \nIt does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.\r  \n\r  \nDespite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).\r  \n\r\r  \n\rAll this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history."

     "I wrote this 1 year ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/hip0kt7/\nmarket cap was $1.1 trillion\n\nI wrote this 2 months ago:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/it3xpyf/?context=3\nmarket cap was $644 billion\n\nToday market cap is: $385 billion\nThe reasons you mentioned are valid; but you left out China demand issues. I mentioned in both of my post above.   I believe China demand has somewhat plateaued. they will sell in record numbers in china in q4; but there are some headwinds:  the subsidy is gone in 2023.  more competition: notably the byd seal: they started selling in september 2022 and in november 2022: it sold 15K. Tesla sells about 10k (edit: model 3 per month.  So there is Model Y: but the byd sea lion is coming (on top of the current competition in the Zeekr 001, BYD Yuan Plus).  I think the sea lion will put a lot of pressure on the Model Y.  Then you add subsidies on EV ends in China in 2023.  So can Tesla still grow in China? Yes, but they will have to either cut prices or come out with a lower price model: both of these will affect margins. \n\nEurope:  This market will continue to grow but there are some cracks. at the end of Q4: Tesla offered some discount on their inventories  (https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-discounts-up-to-e4000-on-model-3-y-purchases-from-existing-inventory-in-europe/).  Subsidies in major markets in Europe is winding down also. UK winded down: https://www.electrive.com/2022/06/14/the-british-government-has-stopped-subsidizing-electric-cars/.  UK market is important to watch because of this.  Germany is also winding down:  by 2024 vehicles above \u20ac45K\nsource: https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-coalition-parties-agree-reduce-e-car-subsidies-handelsblatt-2022-07-26/\nI don't know about France.  ,3 most populous country in the EU are Germany, UK, and France.  Then you have more competition: not just from EV but from traditional hybrids: ie prius, civic hybrid, etc. \n\nUSA:  Tesla was given a carrot here with the IRA (I am still not 100% sure how much if any Tesla buyers will get).  but many won't be able to get this due to income limits.  Saying that I think Tesla will grow by quite a bit here.  However if the following link is accurate: (https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/the-inflation-reduction-act-ev-provisions/), the subsidies for NEW EV is only $7.5 billion: it will run out in 2 to 5 years: depending on how much each vehicle qualifies for and how much qualified EV GM, Ford, VW produce.  \n\nAt the end of the day: Tesla is a premium/luxury cars. the market for these cars is very finite.  Without subsidies, many EV are not cost competitive with hybrids.  \n\nCurrent market cap of $385 billion: this is much more palatable than $1.1 trillion or $644 billion.  But my question is still the same. $385 market cap: at 10% market return: in 7 years: market cap will be $770 billion. And future PE of 25: earnings will have to be about $30.8 billion/year or $7.7 billion/quarter.  Again this is a lot more palatable than what I wrote 2 months ago ($13 billion/quarter)."

Then there are two other big issues. \n\nFirst, increased competition from the big boy car markers, and 2nd, everything to do with FSD. There is going to be lawsuits from customers over false advertising, and all it takes is one confirmed disaster where FSD causes an accident and kills someone. I can see how it works in YouTube videos, and how its advertised, there is a big gap between the two, and I think that's a big legal liability."

It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).\r  \n\r  \nIt operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).\r  \n\r  \nIt does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.\r  \n\r  \nDespite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).\r  \n\r\r  \n\rAll this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history."

This is before you factor in the actual cost of ownership for consumers as ESG policies are showing cracks with pressures on grids and consumers being asked not to charge cars. Honestly, I think Elon knows the game is over. Maybe he thought it would go on a little longer but with interest rates high and inflation still a problem I\u2019m very skeptical we will see Teslas or it as an individual company in the long term. I think Elons twitter acquisition was a way to stay relevant and move into a space which isn\u2019t levered on low interest rates. Something which could still help his passion with space exploration. Whether he will cut his losses and sell or it will be forced to close is something I can\u2019t predict. I think recently you\u2019ve seen his interest is not in Tesla anymore."

To say the entire market has been a volatile shit show since 3/20 is the understatement of all-time.\n\nI will say this though, since I started viewing the SPX as the U.S.'s capital account, things do make more logical sense.  The reason TSLA hasn't gone down more than it has (and likely should if traditional TA matters at all) is AAPL.  VOO and SPY and all other SPX derivative funds have not seen marked outflows to the level commiserate to what the Bond market has to say about liquidity.  TSLA is in the SPX.  AAPL is being used internationally as an inflation hedge and as a defensive domestically.  Ditto the other top 9% of the SPX weight (look at how it breaks down).  But not to the level of AAPL.\n\nIf I told you the SPX was a derivative of its top 5 companies and that they made up the vast majority of exposure of almost any investor in the stock market would you believe me?  If the SPX is the US capital account, then the derivatives are all just planets around the highest weighted corporate suns.\n\nAs such, TSLA is a riskier derivative of the same pot.  I would be a buyer under $90, but I am out of it at $99.  Unless there is substantial adjustment to the SPX between the time I buy and the time I hit my limit.\n\nThe only stocks I have real determination on right now are auto parts stores AZO and ORLY precisely because of the increasing complexity and interest rate sensitivity of new car sales.  Plus so many people are underwater after overpaying for used cars that they will all end up on the road until they are beyond dead.\n\nEven then, I won't grow my existing positions in my taxable account unless I get assigned on puts.  There's far more money to be made in CSP's right now than actual ownership.  The volatility range is tight.  GEX and VEX have been pretty reliable indicators on setting your prices.  SKEW ticked higher before this upcoming dead week.  And I wouldn't mess with TSLA on options anyway, even though there is a MOUNTAIN of puts right now.  The SPX is volatile enough."

The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium. Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that many of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.\\n\\nHe added, without naming anyone, that this is because people who have nothing to offer want to study AI, but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversarie'",

In the vast majority of cases, pouring years of manual labor and $gigazillions of compute resources into AI will not result in something profitable.\n\nGenerative AI in e.g. Photoshop is amazing but that market is a tiny smidgen. There's no new breakthrough for self driving cars or anything else. You can point at everything ChatGPT can do but it's already done, it's unbelievably expensive, and what's stopping it from becoming exponentially better isn't computing power, it's training data and labor. What's sustaining it is how widespread its usefulness is and how disruptive it is to competitors.\n\nPalantir dude is right. And Altman, Woz and Musk alike know the government isn't capable of stopping AI just like they're not capable of stopping drugs or FOSS. They're focused squarely on their respective corporate agendas."

What if giving AI access to optimize your data center means you will save billions compared to your competitors? If you don't do it your competitor will.\n\nThere will always be people who are chasing efficiency and profit wanting to push the boundaries of AI.\n\nThe only way out of this arms race is to agree together to be careful. It's exactly like the nuclear non proliferation treaties... not that that has fully prevented countries like North Korea from developing more nukes. It will likely be really hard to get the same consensus for AI, since denying a country AI could have serious disadvantages economically.\n\nIt's a really hard problem.

There's nothing about LLMs that suggest there's going to be any sign of sentience. GPT and other LLMs are much closer to just a traditional search engine that's wrapped up in a fancy NLP-output package than it is to anything \"live and organic and thinking\". It has no clue what you're talking about, it simply rephrases your question into a searchable prompt, then literally searches the internet for the answer, finds the relevant parts in the articles, then stitch them together using state of the art NLP (probably transformers).\n\nAI also incapable of replacing any part of the industry that is on the cutting-cutting edge of human knowledge, since there's simply no data there. But the stuff closer to the center of human knowledge, absolutely. We should all be THANKFUL that AI will replace certain \"skilled labor positions\" like general surgeon, radiologists, etc. When you're looking for someone to perform a \"regular\" surgery (say dental crown, circumcision, colonoscopy, etc), do you want someone that has performed hundreds of the same surgeries? Because that's what AI is. In fact, LASIK for the longest time has entirely been machine-driven surgery, and it's one of the most successful surgeries out there. If you want a radiology report analyzed, don't you want a machine that has the most up to date knowledge of what cancer looks like, a system that can scan each image and WILL NOT miss a single pixel of data? Yeah absolutely.\n\nBut if you're looking for something that's at the absolute edge of humanity, say a neural chip implant, I'd rather have humans over a \"untrained\" AI.\n\nIf I'm McDonalds, AI is very welcome. The big mac is coming out the same every time. If I'm a 3* michelin star restaurant, AI simply has no place."

The company said it is actively working with relevant standards bodies to codify Teslas charging connector as a public standard.\\n\\nThe charging connector in all Tesla vehicles offers AC charging and up to 1 MW DC charging. Its compact design and performance is considered superior to the Combined Charging System (CCS) connectors used by most EVs in North America.\\n\\nTesla claims that its charging connector and charge port  which it now calls the North American Charging Standard (NACS)  is the most common charging standard in North America. Its a stat based on Tesla vehicle sales in North America and the number of chargers at its branded Supercharging stations. Tesla has nearly 1,500 Supercharger statio'",

It sure as hell ain\u2019t the MAGA contingent who think the earth is flat and spend their weekends coal rolling down main street of nowhere USA. It\u2019s deep pocketed liberals, so when he goes off the deep end and tweets everyone to vote Republican, that shit is going to hurt sales numbers. \n\nTesla majority shareholders have their balls in a Vice right now because of papa Musks Twitter adventures."

Selling cars in the recession and ramp ups of today at higher margins than 2019, definitely no room to reduce price in case demand falls short.\n\nFundamentally Musk just went off the deep end, unlike 2019 when he had completely sane ideas like removing landing legs from a rocket booster but still planning to land it on some bus sized robot arms attached to the launch tower. Fundamentally, what he's doing with Twitter now is just absolute madness, and that obviously translates to Tesla, fundamentally. ^(Superficially, Tesla only has 3x the revenue compared to 2019, just a small difference.)"

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\\n\\nAnalysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.\\n\\nSo far, posit'",

Also, interest rates in MMFs are paying more than inflation and have 0 risk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs an engineer I didn't think tech stocks should've taken the crazy beating they endured last year, but I also don't think they should hit ATHs this year when rates are 5+% and income has been flat.

There is also native terminal! \n\nIts all on face level however. Windows is better, PCs are better, android is better and google is better. But you need a lot of computing knowledge to get there. But overall I can see *why* people buy the products and stay with the products. \n\n\nTesla has lost all hope from me as a stock holder. All other companies are making EV's , and there is push backs on tesla. Unless they make serious bounds in auto driving there isn't much for Tesla to go. Elon equally name is tainting tesla as a company. He got political and really, even myself, got swept up in his pr campaign when he was first coming around. \n\nThere is future for tesla for sure. People keep buying them and driving them. But other companies are going to essentially stop teslas growth. Equally, conservatives hate ev's and liberals hate elon...who the hell do you have left?"

As the following chart shows, the combined market capitalization of Toyota, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, GM, Ford, Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler and PSA), Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Nissan and Renault is still more than $100 billion shy of Teslas market cap decline.\\n\\nSo what caused that extraordinary fall of one of the best-performing stocks of 2020 and 2021? Firstly, Tesla was always valued as a high-growth stock, meaning much of its valuation was based on its future potential. As the economic outlook darkened throughout 2022, so did Teslas potential for future growth, especially considering that inflation and high interest rates will eventually affect consumer spending on big-ticket items such as cars.\\n\\nSecondly, Elon Musks acquisition o'",

Maybe VW.  They are, but not as intense as they should be imo. Even the Toyota ceo saying they are pushing better combustion engines. \nCar companies are sort of investing in it but more like a \u201cjust in case\u201d. They look more old big companies that don\u2019t want to change due to the complexity of the companies. \n\nI think these car makers are just waiting for the next republican controller government to push any EV related bill or help way past 2030s and get more years out of the status quo."

     "Good critical analysis, thank you for sharing. I have some comments you could check out if you want:\n\n>The Berlin factory cost around $5b and comes with a capacity of 250k cars.\n\nI think if you look at floor space compared to Shanghai capacity is over 1 million at least, even more for Giga Texas. Don't forget that Shanghai was also guided at 250k capacity. This is because ramping takes infinite time and effort+includes risk, so best to say a low number. Especially in slower ramp rate/permit/anything locations like Germany. Feel free to quantify floorspace and ramp rate etc. if you don't believe. I think terminally Berlin 1.5 million, Texas 2 million or more depending what they place in the building.\n\n>If Tesla wants to increase capacity by 4m units, they need to invest roughly $80b.\n\nCapex per vehicle went down each factory generation, feel free to quantify if you don't believe. If they make a cheaper vehicle I expect significant savings in this aspect also, knowing about gigapress.\n\n>35% in the next 12 months\n\nTime will tell, I see the recession. Perhaps they will have big problems. However, there is also upside if factories in Texas/Berlin ramp, margins improve. And if dollar weakens, or china economy strengthens, china profits increase. Furthermore operating leverage increases the more cars they make.\n\nYou value the new technology at 10% but that's fine since it is risky business valueing it. But I am a fan because of the new tech. I see big potential if some new tech comes through let alone multiple (fsd, dojo chip, Optimus, 4680, energy). For me the stock is an option on the new tech, with limited risk to lose money if they just execute the rest.\n\nSo overall I would estimate they have 5 million capacity floorspace, unknown tooling, possibly bottleneck by supplier. I value the new tech based on risky/rough projections."

     "I think you're missing some critical pieces with the margin section.   Their margin has been abnormally high because due to easy money they have been able to sell mostly very highly upgraded cars.  \n\nIn a recession people will buy less cars and they will buy cheaper cars.  \n\nTo maintain their multiple, TSLA is going to have to do 3 things.  \n\n1. They must continue increasing production.  Cost of capital just went way up too...\n2. They must sell all of their increased production.\n3. They must still make a profit.  \n\nThe problem is with high rates, a recession and falling home prices, It's going to be very hard to do all 3 of these things.  It was very easy to sell 100k cars when houses in California were appreciating that much a year and people could pull out equity at <3%.  It was also easy to sell 60k EV's when gas was nearing $7.  \n\nRealistically TSLA will need to discount to sell all of their production.  They will also need to slow growth to avoid losing money."

The notion that margins will stay identical between a \"no competition\" (past 10 years) and  \"full competition\" (future 10 years) is not viable. \n\nAlso I am now wondering why Stellantis has such phenomenal numbers?!

The early adopters have been households that can afford to purchase, however I don't think that will be the case for the majority.

     "I highly doubt the growth in car sales because they have so far proven unable to release and meaningfully update their portfolio. Since 2016, the same 4 cars are on sale. Almost every legacy automaker has designed and launched more EV models than Tesla in the same time frame, with infinitely more configuration options.\n\nDemand will dry up for what is already an aging product portfolio. Given the low amounts spent on R&D, I highly doubt Tesla will update their offerings quickly enough.\n\nThis comes from a former tesla owner who leases a new car every 3 years. I went away to an other brand (still EV) because I didn\u2019t see myself leasing the same model in another colour for another 3 years. I might have, had there been a proper facelift. \n\nAnd driving a competitor\u2019s product now, I really don\u2019t see any way in which tesla is apparently still \u2018ahead of competition\u2019. Quite the contrary. FSD is a joke, there is no edge in battery tech, build quality is abysmal. Service? Yeah. This, coupled with Musk\u2019s gigantic efforts to make everyone hate him, wouldn\u2019t have me touch this stock with a 10 foot pole.\n\nThe most likely long-term outcome for me is that they\u2019re bought by a Chinese conglomerate and continue to produce a few models out of spare parts, like Maserati."

     "Excellent analysis thanks for this. An area that I think is often overlooked is the addition of the Semi-truck. This opens a lot of new doors for Tesla and breaks what is possibly the biggest Market - commercial transport. \n\nIt is still early days and they only have Pepsi signed up as a sort of test case - a pretty good one all things considered.  If they can prove the Semi to be the best ROI versus traditional it\u2019s game over for legacy who pretty much said this was impossible and do not have anything like this ready. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what this means margins wise but this will eat into legacies share in this market, which up until now was not considered in any analysis!\n\nI am also pretty gobsmacked at the reception to FSD, I was watching the latest update 10.69 (probably) and it\u2019s incredible. I think we are all seriously overlooking the fact that cars are now driving themselves and this is in BETA mode!  \n\nRegardless of the accidents and other issues which of course need to be investigated - did anyone actually think there wouldn\u2019t be accidents using tech like this \u2018come on man?\u2019  \n\nThis aside, for the most part they have a product that not only works but is a subscription model and is the first to market adding new streams of income. \n\nLastly remember that all this ramping up in both scale and deliveries was during COVID where supply chains were strained and everything was considered \u2018doomsday\u2019.  Yet they still outperformed every other car maker and market expectations. In addition to this they built Giga factories, secured leasing deals with lithium mines and chip makers before interest rates went up.  So they borrowed in a low interest environment - I think this to be key in its future success. \n\nThis means that OEM\u2019s and EV startups (all but Tesla) will need to ramp up and scale during a harder time to borrow money and a harder time to sell \u2018luxury goods\u2019 potentially let alone have comparable products. This is when Tesla will dramatically lower its prices, we are seeing this already with $7500 off before next years incentive. \n\nA side note that I think quite funny about Tesla and advertising and a negative for now. \n\nUp until now Tesla hasn\u2019t paid for any advertising, but now musk has bought Twitter for 54 billion lol. That\u2019s probably more than all of the legacies ad spend combined and Tesla paid for that :(.  \n\nHere\u2019s hoping that it will have been worth it."

     "Yep, this was kind of the consensus for a long time.  Elon had some wild ideas of growth and capability that never really fit reality, and the massive growth required was a bullet point against that fantasy.\n\nAnd also yep, Tesla isn't a bad stock to get back into.  It's just that the market won't be kind to it for a little while with Elon behaving the way he has.  His name is tied to tightly with the brand for him not to cause issues.  The company as a whole though is and has been doing solid.  It's now just a question of how low will it go and when to step back in.\n\nHowever, there is a bigger challenge Tesla faces.  Many other automakers are stepping HARD into the EV market space, and Tesla no longer has the luxury of being pretty much the only EV maker capable of high volume production an non boring cars or no astronomically priced cars.  This luxury of theirs is fleeting, and they will have to transition into a real grind to fight for market share.  There's really no sugar coating this.  Telsa is effectively being forced into mainstream and now has a sea of competition.  They have to get VERY good with their design, manufacturing, marketing, everything to stay not only a leader but also to stay relevant.  If they are lazy or misunderstand what's critically important (for example, key talent) they could lose a huge portion of their market.  I bring up the example because Musk has notoriously inhumanized humans and doesn't exactly value the talent he has.  He doesn't really understand it, and he may lose everything for it.\n\nI like EV stuff, but interestingly I've never really cared much about Tesla products.  I think other brands are doing more interesting stuff, making better products.  There are some really nice bits that Telsa is doing, like making these really big chassis castings which helps a ton with manufacturing, but once the big players are in the game, they have all the resources in the world to do the same or better.  Tesla worked up to this stuff over years.  Companies like Ford can do this with a 1 second choice, and all the infrastructure and manpower is already there.  This is the same problem with other EV startups.  Companies like Rivian and Lucid have massive uphill climbs into real relevancy and retention.  All they have is uniqueness and labor talent.  This is where companies like Canoo are interesting in that they are thinking very different about vehicles, and it's in these deviations that you really separate yourself from the big powerhouses in the industry.  Seriously, Canoo might be the first EV I might actually buy specifically because they fundamentally are so different.  But even they are quite a ways off from relevance.\n\nBut all of this is getting a bit off topic.  The point is Tesla is in a tough spot.  They have a guy that's the face of the brand that's going nuts.  They have car designs that might not survive real competition from major automakers.  And they don't seem to value employees well enough to retain good talent.  They're losing the single advantage they've had for a decade.  The only saving grace is Telsa, the company, is run pretty well, and they've made excellent effort to develop the underlying infrastructure to actually make a million EV cars.  When you're competing against companies with production targets of 15,000, it's no contest.\n\nI am curious where the stock will settle to.  I am also curious what the next 5 years will be like for the brand as people and product compete against the big boys.  We'll never again see the massive growth Tesla's stock showed, but I'm curious how it will progress over 5 to 10 years."

But one thing I do know is that a lot of people have assumed that Tesla will take a huge share of the future EV market due to their big head start, and that is just looking less and less likely every day. Traditional car manufacturers are catching up quickly with their own EVs, usually with better build quality and service support, and meanwhile it seems like Tesla is kind of just coasting, not releasing any new models or even refreshing existing ones. I mean, the Model S is a decade old at this point, and every other Tesla is basically just the same design in different proportions (some awkward). Also, it's easy to overestimate the impact of Elon Musk becoming a right-wing troll on Twitter, since not every potential Tesla buyer is extremely online, but he definitely hasn't been doing anything recently to convince me he's really some kind of genius visionary and TSLA's future is bright."

Tesla is just making insane amounts of profits.\n\nOver the past year, despite massive headwinds in Q2 (2/3rds of their production shut down for weeks due to Shanghai COVID lockdowns), as well as rising material costs and a global chip shortage, they were able to massively increase their sales and margins, and by extension net income from $2.2B to $9.5B TTM, a 332% YoY increase. And all of that while investing in building two factories that are each larger than their first two factories combined at the same time.\n\nNow Berlin is proving to be comparable to China in terms of margins despite much higher local wages, and the US government has decided to give Tesla free money for cars and batteries they were already making and selling with huge margins anyways. As a result, expectations from people with proven track records that Tesla will grow earnings another 155% over the next year may even be on the low end, even though that already gives Tesla a PEG of 0.59. ([This video does a good job going through the numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaABZbFZ4rs))\n\nThe only reason why people are surprised about Tesla's stock price is because they're refusing to do the work and actually look at the numbers, instead of only reasoning by analogy looking a single irrelevant metric like unit sales or a PE value."

     "It always amazes me the lack of research and understanding people have here. When you go through it all, it becomes obvious. Tesla will no doubt be the most valuable company within the next six years. \n\n1. First off, the people using P/E clearly don't understand the purpose of P/E. You don't use P/E to measure the profitability of a company that isn't quite designed to be as profitable as possible. This same reason is why many of you would have never bought Apple, Amazon, etc., at their early stages and would have made enough $ to retire by now. \n2. \"BUT THEIR MARKET CAP IS HIGHER THAN ALL THE OTHER AUTOMAKERS COMBINED.\" That's because traditionally, auto companies have never been valued highly in the market. Why? Because it's a low-growth business... the market was saturated with ICE vehicles, no differentiation between products, and a lack of innovation. Hence, people didn't really care for the auto companies in the markets. It was boring and while they made good profit that was being distributed via dividends, people largely stayed away from auto companies. Just look a their historical stock performance... the ATH for Ford was two decades ago. And a lot of you might not realize this but in 2008, GM and Chrysler got hit badly. Why? Because consumer financing with a broken economy meant GM and Chrysler had a pile of debt that consumers couldn't pay off. These auto companies are highly leveraged. A bad economy means they will have piles of vehicles that consumers can't afford to finance again.\n3. Tesla changed the auto industry. This is undeniable. Ask yourself, when was the last time the auto industry was this interesting? When was the last time you saw these auto companies actually start to innovate? Never, until Tesla shook the market. And that's why people are betting highly on Tesla. They're the ones innovating in a brand new industry. And yes, EV's are a brand new industry. It's why auto companies are spending billions trying to revamp or create new manufacturing plants. It's why they are having huge supply chain shortages particularly for EV's. It's why GM had to pause sales on their Chevy Bolt for over 7 months because they had an exploding battery issue. New industry, not the same as ICE. Same way renewable energy products are different from oil. Both can be used as energy generation fuel but they are entirely different in composition. Ford's CEO even openly admits that they are trying to copy Tesla. GM's CEO, Mary Barra, her entire EV strategy is literally what Tesla did..... like 6 years ago.\n4. What's the P/E of VW, Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, etc., if you only include their EV segment? Because that's what matters here and that is what many of you are are missing. Tesla isn't in the business of competing against other EV companies as much as they are in the business of taking market share from ICE companies. Right now, outside of luxury EV models such as the Porsche Taycan, there are no profitable EV's other than Tesla's. And it will be that way for many more years. So if you're going to be fair and start comparing P/E of these EV initiatives, at least look at the broader comparison. Why compare ICE vehicles, a dying industry, to EV vehicles? Look across the board: Almost every auto company in the world are looking to stop selling ICE vehicles by 2040 (latest). California already plans to ban ICE sales by 2035. Using the P/E and market cap of an ICE company to compare against an EV company is the same logic as saying 'Why buy Apple stock when they released the iPhone instead of Nokia?' They both sold phones and Nokia had a much larger revenue/profit than Apple at that time. There were many Apple pessimists who made such claims... stating that no one wanted a touch screen phone, it's a fad, it won't last, etc., \n5. Tesla already has the highest margins in the auto business outside of exotic luxury vehicles. Think about it from this perspective: While other auto companies lose money for every EV they sell, Tesla makes the highest in the industry for every EV they sell. That's because Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto company in the world dating back to the fact that many of their parts couldn't be purchased elsewhere and they had to use cost-saving measures due to the fact that they were on the verge of bankruptcy. That mindset led to Tesla constantly innovating in engineering. Their gigaStamp is a revolutionary process in creating the vehicle chassis and significantly reduces costs. Even the car seats are made by Tesla. The software, made by Tesla. Batteries are made by Tesla and with strong emphasis on 4680, they will likely be one of the biggest battery makers in the future as well. Auto companies historically do not do this type of shit. They are just assembly lines. They get the parts and build the car. While that's a good thing for ICE, it's a bad thing for EV's. Software is the biggest key here. VW recently came out and stated that their software will likely be outsourced to Apple instead... AKA, Apple Carplay. They don't even know how to improve their software. Meanwhile, Tesla is capable of creating software allowing them to play Steam games, push OTA updates to perform self-driving features, improve vehicle performance, improve firmware for their cameras. Much like how you would buy a laptop or phone, the software capabilities for a vehicle will largely be the differentation as competition increases.\n6. Tesla is already going to be the most profitable auto company in the U.S. by this year. By next year, they will be the most profitable auto company in the world. For reference, Tesla only became profitable on an annual basis in 2020. So in a span of five years, they would have went from being unprofitable to being the most profitable auto company. The numbers are insane when you look at it... Per vehicle sold, Tesla is already the most profitable company. Automakers like VW and Toyota largely made vehicles that are low profit-per-unit but they earn money through high volume. If they can't push towards more EV sales in the future, they are going to be toast. BMW and Benz are high profit automakers. Yet, neither of them sell any EV's that are affordable compared to their ICE version. The performance of those ICE versions also significantly outperform their EV's so in a sense, there is no incentive to purchase their EV's currently. Toyota doesn't even believe in BEV's. They are still of the mindset that hydrogen fuel is the way to go because after spending billions of $, they are too stubborn to admit it was a failure. All they push out are Hybrids and they did so because they wanted to meet the regulatory standards and not be hit with a carbon tax. They are falling BEHIND..... So let me guess, Tesla is a cult? In two years, they will be the most profitable automaker in the world while selling a product (EV's) that other automakers will  be losing money selling. Sign me up!\n7. I've been investing in Tesla since 2014... Believe me, the amount of criticism that Tesla gets today pales in comparison to what they received in 2018 when they were on the verge of bankruptcy. This is peanuts. It went from, 'EV's are a fad, Tesla can't mass manufacture EV's, they will be bankrupt, they're only profitable because of regulatory credits, other competition is coming (Oh, really, the same automakers who pledge to go fully EV in 15 years but the competition is coming...?). Heard it all by now. This isn't anything new. \n8. Not even going to go on about their energy storage capabilities, supercharging network, AI expertise (currently the largest AI company in the world), robotics (watch their AI event next week), Tesla insurance, no dealership model, FSD, etc.,... Those are things you can either choose to believe or not believe in. I'm more focused on the fact that they are the only company even willing to engage in all of this. That shows me a company that is constantly innovating. The very fact Tesla does all this while other automakers don't should tell you one thing: They don't have the expertise nor are they focused on shareholder value. Hence, why auto companies have been terrible performers in the stock market for the past two decades until Tesla ignited the EV formula and now you're seeing companies like BYD, NIO, XPENG, LUCID, RIVIAN, etc., all pop up trying to take market from the ICE segment. Remember, they are not competing against each other as much as they are competing for the ICE sales.\n\nThis dude runs a company that builds rockets and wants to take civilization to Mars.... Think about that for a second. You might say it's stupid and I would probably agree with you. But this is the type of person you are dealing with. Once he stepped into the auto business, it became revolutionized. Once he went into the aero industry, he revolutionized it. This is not a person you want to bet against and the market will find that even more evident when Tesla and SpaceX both become top five companies in the world by market cap."

     "This is one of the easiest and simplest answer to give. There are currently many uncertainties in the broader market right now due to the state of the economy and inflation. Most of these do not affect Tesla though as the auto industry is undergoing an evolution, and this evolution will not stop regardless if there is a recession or not. A valuation of a company is based on many many forces in the market, its industry, itself, etc. The force of evolution in the auto market is relatively strong compared to the general market. So other companies, their value is going down because of these uncertainty and most of the companies you mentioned are mature, and therefore is more exposed to these effects than a company that is part of an evolution / revolution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's growth trajectory in terms of sales is one of the most reliable in today's market. As in the last year, despite the many supply chain issues plaguing the whole industry, both EV and legacy auto, Tesla still managed to grow by 40-50% or more. No other car company in the world is doing this consistently quarter by quarter like Tesla, in fact no other company. This is because of this revolution that Tesla has spearheaded and it has become the main beneficiary of this revolution and downturn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink of it this way, when the world decided to adopt cellphones, or touchscreen phones, did the state of the economy prevented these things to happen? No. It might slow it down a little bit, but this slow down is like a miniscule amount. This is what is happening with Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilar to how Amazon came out of the 2008 unscathed and even bigger than before, despite the huge downturn during this time. The downturn actually emphasized how great of a company Amazon is during this time as before 2008, it was competing head to head with eBay. After 2008, eBay is now barely a competitor to the giant Amazon has become. The downturn accelerated this process, and that is what has happened with Tesla during Covid and will continue in the next coming years. So even if we enter a recession, Tesla's stock will get hit similar like everyone else, but it will come out like an Amazon coming out of the 2008 recession.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I have identified Tesla as the next blue chip similar to how I felt 10 years ago Amazon is the next blue chip company. So during covid, I feel that Tesla is one of the safest companies to invest in due to their stellar and consistent track record and a crazy moat of advantage."

     "Because Tesla continues to beat expectations and grow rapidly. A few of the catalysts for growth both now and in the near future include:\n\n* Giga Berlin and Austin continue to ramp up rapidly, which will greatly increase the number of vehicles Tesla produces in the future.\n\n* It's rumored that Tesla will soon announce at least one new upcoming Gigafactory soon, possibly on their next earnings call. There's a decent amount of evidence that they're strongly considering Canada for the next location. Regardless of where it is though, once that factory is built and ramped in a few years it'll be producing a half a million vehicles a year most likely. \n\n* With the above 2 points, it's increasingly obvious that Tesla can definitely hit a 10 million vehicle per year production mark in the future, putting them on the same level as other auto companies like Toyota.\n\n* Tesla has consistently proven to be able to navigate the supply shortages much better then the other automakers, even while continuing to expand and produce more vehicles each year. \n\n* We're getting more solid information about when the Cybertruck will finally start to come out, likely next year. Once they do then that'll almost certainly cause a nice increase in Tesla's sales."

  "Text": "b'Tesla Inc.s shares dropped the most in three months after the carmaker blamed a disappointing deliveries report on shipment issues that increased the number of vehicles that were on their way to customers as the quarter came to a close.\\n\\nThe maker of Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossovers handed over 343,830 vehicles to customers in the last three months, short of the almost 358,000 total that analysts expected. The stock fell 8.2% at 11:20 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday decline since June 16.\\n\\nTesla has for years delivered big batches of vehicles toward the end of each quarter, a practice Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has tried to move away from by localizing production in all major regions. While the carmaker opened its first European factory in Germany in March, record shipping costs are still bedeviling the auto industry along with shortages of semiconductors and other components.\\n\\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-02/tesla-delivers-record-343-830-cars-mis'",

If you told me at the start of the year that NASDAQ, Bitcoin and certain growth stocks would be down as much as they are today I'd have thought TSLA would be down 60-70% easy.\n\nThe only way I can explain it is that there are just two groups of people when it comes to TSLA... One group is the long-term, die hard believers, and the other group are those that believe it's insanely overvalued, but have lost money shorting it for years. If you look at the short interest between 2020-2021 the shorts seemed to just give up and never came back."

It's a material impact on their financial statement.  Its starting to look like they have no plan to get this under control and its going to be costly to fix.  The same for the service issues.  \n\nTo me that weighs more heavily on future growth than any of the other factors people are citing.  If they can't get their logistics sorted at this level of sales then it's only going to get worse as they bring on more production and more models. Their gross margin will suffer because they are stuck with an inefficient and costly logistics system that they appear to be unable to fix."

You also have to figure in that after the 500 miles they must have an available charger. I\u2019m not sure that the infrastructure is there yet for that. \n\nGas is so much more convenient. You find a station, which you can always find even in very rural areas, and you\u2019re in and out in 5 minutes.\n\nWith that said, some local companies will I\u2019m sure hop on if they can get one."

     "Jonas has always been one of Musk's biggest cheerleaders, as well as the person responsible for some of the more annoying questions on various car company conference calls.\n\nAs for companies with exposure to China, I'd be concerned with anything that has talked about a \"china growth story\" - Starbucks (which was down quite a bit yesterday) being another example.\n\nEdit: I'm not sure why there's so much eagerness for investing in China/defense of anything negative. You clearly have a government that is not market friendly:\n\n\"These cracks were well-flagged. The trigger was the surprise appointments of China\u2019s power apex unveiled on Sunday. Contrary to hopes that Xi would at least nod to balancing factional powers within the Party, reform-minded Premier Li Keqiang and Vice Premier Wang Yang lost their seats at the seven-men politburo standing committee. Instead, he filled it with his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9s including Beijing Party Chief Cai Qi and Shanghai Party Chief Li Qiang. The latter had ordered weeks of Covid-19 lockdowns earlier this year in the Chinese financial hub despite its devastating impact on the economy. He is now tipped to become China\u2019s next premier. The selloff reflects investors\u2019 fears that a more powerful Party leadership will increasingly prioritise the state at the cost of the private sector. Mollifying that message will be a tough early test for Xi\u2019s new economic team.\" (https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/xi-jinpings-third-term-gets-markets-thumbs-down-2022-10-24/)\n\nThese names will probably bounce soon because the selling is getting excessive, but if there's a bounce rather than take it as some sort of victory lap that the China investment thesis is still a thing, it should be regarded as a selling opportunity. You've already had instances in recent years of officials trying to walk back market unfriendly policies only to eventually add more. Now you have a government that's likely to be even less market friendly. It's not even a matter of whether one believes in the GDP or not, it's that - at the core - the market thinks that the people elected are not going to be market friendly. The government there is not going to view the market as the priority and that's fine and their choice and there's plenty of other places to look for investments around the world.\n\n If there is further evidence that China will be one regulation after another, you're going to have investors who are not going to pay the valuations they once did because of the risk that any day the government there will decide it doesn't like the industry your investment is in."

     "To be fair to the bulls, it's not like this is a hype stock that has no earnings and is just pure magic in the air. There is a strong underlying business with good fundamentals. The question now is whether the price reflects a fair value that you should pay for that business.\n\nDespite the YoY revenue declines, I think once the economy emerges the other side of this inflation battle, that downtrend will have been temporary. However I do think this stock is being priced to perfection, and the expected growth argument I've seen from multiple bulls is that this price action brings it into line with other big Tech (P/E in the 25 region or so). This growth argument is expecting all of the chips falling Nvidia's way (excuse the pun) over the medium term which in my view is highly optimistic. I can see this stock pulling back back but I think the days of this being a below $200 stock may be over unless economic shit hits the fan."

I view it as 10 year investment horizon, and I didn't really care what financials looked like.  I believe in the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/5-stages-of-the-hype-cycle) idea.  During that time period, I also worked for a VC growth accelerator program; so I'm biased to ideas that I've seen pitched.  But the new markets created that benefits Nvidia:\n\n* Generative AI (current hype wave), AND I also think there will 'Models-As-A-Service' that will likely emerge that will disrupt current SAAS businesses (future hype train)\n* Metaverse (current Trough of Disillusion).  As generative AI gets easier and better (art then video then 3D objects); then Metaverse can happen.  It's no secret even way back then, that Apple was also looking into the space.\n* Crypto-Blockchain -  (current Trough of Disillusion); another big bull run will eventually happen within the next 10 years.\n* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.\n* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.\n* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    \n\nI don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen."

     "People will say and do anything to take shots at Tesla.\n\n1. Highest fcf in a quarter by Tesla ever by over $522 million. Q1 tends to be the strongest quarter for vehicles so for Q3 to beat Q1 by over $522 million shows how capable this company is at making money.\n2. Margins have been decreasing because Austin/Berlin represents a higher % of vehicles being sold. That along with increased costs for labor/supply chain has affected them like it has with every company. It isn't specific to Tesla. They have also been pumping money into the 4680 cells which are not yet scaled. $250 million in currency depreciation took a toll on their profits as well.\n3. Regulatory credits revenue has declined because there are fewer vehicle sales in the market. The negative for Tesla is it's unlikely they will ever see the $600 million amount they saw in Q1 but regulatory credits are such a small part and won't play a role in the future. It will eventually hit $0.\n4. Operating income is worth focusing on because the overall auto industry has seen a declining operating margin. Tesla has increased their operating margin significantly going from 14.6% Q3-2021 to 17.2% Q3-2022.\n5. They still expect to hit 50% yoy in deliveries. I don't believe they will hit that mark for this year but maybe they can pull it off. Expected net income for year 2022 is about $13 billion. That would put them as the most profitable automaker in the United States and probably only behind Toyota and VW. They will surpass them by 2023.\n\nThe biggest factor right now would be the $7.5k tax credit. I personally know a few people who are waiting on that tax credit before ordering.\n\nIt was a decent quarter. Nothing overly bad/good. Just lots of unpredictability in the overall market so you have to absolutely kill it, like Netflix did, to get some traction right now."

These comments are not anything new from Mr. Musk. \n\nI have no problem with his comments because we are all entitled to our opinions. But I would LOVE to see some kind of backlash in terms of employees leaving for other tech firms who treat them better. \n\nSilicon Valley started because companies in the area started to lure away engineers from IBM, promising flexible hours and casual attire to contrast with IBM's rigid corporate culture. So if Tesla engineers start electing to work for companies that respect work-life balance (as much as I hate that term), then over time the culture will shift.\n\nBut for the short term, Tesla will remain an incredibly sought-after position and they will likely be able to make these demands until the supply of fresh meat (aka - engineering grads) dries up.\n\nSource: Several friends who work/worked at Tesla from 2010 through now, SF Bay Area offices in various departments."

But his email was a terrible way to state this policy.    \n\n>that is why I lived in the factory so much- so that those on the line could see me working alongside them.   \n\nYeah, I'm sure you bothering the line workers or sleeping on your office floor is what solved Tesla's production problems.    \n\nI'm gonna say I work in engineering and have worked in various industries.  I always knew there would be times when I would be expected to work more than the standard 40 hours/week. If the company was trying to get a new product out, or a customer was waiting for a delivery, you might have to work nights and weekends until it happened.  Most engineers I knew assumed the same.  But once things calmed down, you went back to 40 hours/week, and might even get some comp time for your efforts    \n\nIn my experience, when you see:    \n>Everyone at Tesla is required to **spend a minimum of forty hours** in the office per week.    \n\nrun away from that company.  It's sweatshop.  Every week will be crunch time, and you will be expected to spend lots of time in the office, while your boss watches to make sure you are."

Everyone spoke like they were brainwashed into believing how good these vacuum products were. That motivation and brainwashing stops when people are tuning in on zoom.

Even if they double Austin and Berlin, how do you get to 4.8m without another factory?  IIRC it took about 2.5 years for Shangahai, Berlin and Austin to go from announced to making cars so any factory that is going to be making significant volume in 2025 needs to get started like yesterday."

I don't think they'll nearly double their sales by 2024, but even if they do and sell every car they produce, they are going to have a lot of trouble sustaining their margins when are already struggling at current levels of production. They are largely driven by hype, and Elon has done a great job blowing that up. Does TSLA have any products or technology that justify its valuation as a tech company? any competitive advantages? Their methods/sensors for FSD are inherently worse than what other auto makers are doing, and everything I see and hear is that their build quality is subpar. I expect they'll see a lot more competition very soon, and being valued more than all other auto makers combined =/= undervalued"

Half are skeptical of teslas forward growth and feel that insane growth is already priced into stock, half think Tesla will in fact end up being Google and Apple and Toyota x5 all rolled into one super company.  No one at this point who is a Tesla bull will be convinced by anything you can say and no one who thinks they are massively overpriced will be convinced by any narrative.  \n\nI feel like I\u2019m in the middle.  Tesla\u2019s edge in EVs transcends their insane vertical integration, technology and manufacturing prowess, amazing revenue etc to include brand recognition and loyalty that is approaching Apple levels.  At the same time, they are valued as though selling 25m cars and charging 300 bucks a month for FSD subscriptions in 10 years is a lock.  I guess that\u2019s why I don\u2019t have any TSLA but would buy at the right price."

     "Valuation is based on earnings and earnings growth. Tesla may be \"just a car company\", but Apple was once just a phone company and Amazon was once just a retailer (although now its valuation is based on AWS). The point is, it's not necessarily about what the company sells but how much the company earns and grows. A company could sell paper clips and command a 100 P/E if their earnings and growth rate support it. Going on a bit of a tangent, Tesla and Amazon  actually have very similar PEs and Amazon's is usually higher.\n\nThere literally isn't another company that has both greater earnings (9.5B net income in the TTM despite Covid lockdowns in Shanghai in Q2) and growth rate (50% CAGR) than Tesla. And the upcoming Q3 will be another record-breaking quarter.\n\nAnd for additional context, Tesla's operating income growth is 225% in the TTM showing huge margin improvements. Even smaller, high growth, early stage companies do not grow as fast as Tesla."

     "The main issue is you can't value a company like Tesla by looking at the PE. PE is one metric that can be useful when evaluating mature companies that are showing financial consistency and easily comparable to others in a similar industry. It's a quick and dirty way to look at companies but you definitely have to look beyond just PE. \n\n Is Tesla's value largely due to its software? AI? Vehicle? Battery? Supercharger Network? Manufacturing? The truth is that no one is scaling EV's at 50% a year and at the margin that they have. Auto industry is $2.5T. Right now, every Tesla sold is an ICE sale lost from legacy auto.\n\nCritics have been saying \"Wait until Toyota, or VW, or Ford, or any other legacy auto start ramping up EV's\" for 10 years. How many EV's GM sell last year? 30? How many are they selling this year? I just don't think many of the legacy auto, who have to divert their attention and resources to their ICE business for at least the next 10 years, will catch up to Tesla. That isn't to say things will always go right for Tesla but right now no other company is close to matching them."

     "It is complicated and there is no way for someone to just explain it without you researching.\n\nHere is some things to consider. Tesla is making 30% profit margin on EVs (less for Q2 due to china lockdowns and ramping 2 new factories, will be back to 30% this quarter). Ford and GM make 5-7% profit margin on vehicles AND parts. (Tesla part sales goes into service revenue). That means Tesla makes 5x the profit on higher end cars. Every 1 car Tesla sells is equal to 5 cars Gm/F sells. (for profit).\n\nHow does Tesla have such high margins? Giga castings  and having 2 main models, faster and cheaper to build. Tesla also making changes to lower the cost or performance daily. Gm/F makes 1 change per year. \n\nTesla energy/storage just starting to rapidly grow in profits, should be well over 100 million in profits this quarter. \n\nTesla is near complete with general autonomous software, which is not price in anyway. Mobileye relies on map and will only work where it has been tested. Tesla FSD works everywhere. \n\nDemand. I think everyone can agree that operating an EV is cheaper then ICE. (not counting the price of the car). Less cost per mile and less maintenance. When demand starts to fall be it next year or 5 years from now, Tesla could drop the prices and still have great margins.\n\nSo how do people put a value on a company? Look 5 years out and discount that back to today. Take the 1.4 million deliveries for 2022 (tesla should end around that number), take the 50% growth for the next 5 years, and take the ave selling price with 30% margin. Discount that back to today to get the projected value of the company. Adjust the numbers down to what you think Tesla will not reach it's goal.\n\nThat is how people get Tesla at a much higher value. Most ignore profits from everything else. \n\nTesla is growing production rapidly while all the big automakers have been lowering production and having a hard time producing EVs. \n\nI will admit, if I did not know everything there is to know on Tesla, I would have gotten scared out of Tesla by now."

     "What do you mean that it is a car company? Are you trying to compare its PE with a regular car company? If you are doing this, you are going to be so way off.\n\nJust to give you first my background, I am an accountant, so here is the perspective from an accountant.\n\nTesla and legacy car companies, the financial structure is heaven and earth so difference, and this is why tesla's value is so much more than a regular car company.\n\n1. The value of an EV car company = the future profits MINUS the TOTAL COST OF GETTING RID OF THE OLD ICE CAR BUSINESS. Tesla has a lot of the former, as it is projected that they will be the most profitable car company in the world next year beating out Toyota and VW. They have ZERO of the latter as they do not make non-EV cars.\n2. Legacy car companies and actually a lot of legacy companies in general from decades ago, they were built differently in terms of capital structure. A lot of these companies have debt, some of them have more than $100B in debt. A quick google and from a July 2020 article, VW has $151B in debt, Toyota $138B, Ford $122B, BMW $114B. How much is Tesla's DEBT? Not even $3B as of June 2022. It is even more crazy that this number is so low as usually one of the valuation metrics that is often looked at is debt to the value of the stock and since Tesla's value is much higher, this metric Tesla just demolishes. This is an IMPORTANT metric especially in the face of a recession as it reflects the risk of the company going bankrupt. This means Tesla has close to zero chance in going bankrupt, while other companies, not so much. If you remember, many of these companies were on the verge of going bankrupt in 2008 before the government saved them. I am  not sure the same treatment will happen if it happens in the future as the world has changed a lot since.\n3. Supply chain - Tesla has almost a monopoly on the supply chain of EVs, and even in the face of challenges, they are the only car company that is able to put up Tech company- level growth of over 40% consistently in this environment. If you look at the other car companies, other than the EV companies, they all have either sub-10% growth or worse, negative. Growth = higher PE. Longer track record of growth = even higher PE, check out Amazon in the last 20 years. But Tesla also has locked down supply of batteries and has one of the most reliable sources of batteries. Whereas every car company trying to make EV cant seem to get enough of batteries, Tesla can as they have already locked this down years ago.\n4. The product itself, Tesla;s cars packs a big value even at its price point, before COVID, they grinded down by lowering price as they have also managed to cut significantly the cost of building EVs. VWs CEO has admitted that Tesla basically can build the same car, not only faster than VW, but also cheaper for the same level. You know what this means right? big profits, and ability to churn out more. This mean higher PE.\n\nAll in all, if you look at Tesla's profit growth, it has been doubling or tripling sometimes. And if you understand how caiptal intensive businesses work, once you past the breakeven point, the profit growth is massive, hence why their profit is growing at like 100%+ even though revenue is only growing 40%+.\n\nI have not even talked about labour unions, dealership network, vendor network that is bringing down the value of the other car companies, as that is another long post of its own. \n\nAs we get into the recession, you will see how reliable Tesla's profitability is going to be, which is why its valuation is it is. You should check out Amazon during the 2008 crisis and years after."

Yea, I think it\u2019s a little inflated, but it\u2019s growing into its valuation very quickly even with the stock growing. \n\nSpeculative areas, autonomy and robotics. Imo there is a higher likelihood that Tesla gets their FSD to work (once it works, it works everywhere) before anyone else can get it to work somewhere and then scale it worldwide. Teslas data advantage is actually disgusting, and grows by the day. As for robotics, I think they have a great chance at doing something cool, but I don\u2019t even bother thinking about the sex bot.

But it doesn't make much sense to look at it in a vacuum. Because of their impressive growth the P/E had been steadily dropping, and rather quickly since they became profitable. In a few years I suspect the P/E won't be quick so wild.maybe in the high 30s... Which isn't all that strange for a tech company in a good position... Maybe for an automaker, but that simply isn't the full story. Tesla is one of a kind.

You can add up all of the valuations of everything that Tesla says they want to be to justify their market cap and they'll still be priced way too high, but none of this matters because it is the cult of Elon. Anyone here who has ever shorted or bought Puts on Tesla has probably learned their lesson. Frankly I don't see why anyone holds TSLA shares anymore after getting these kinds of profits over the years. You're just putting unnecessary risk on your portfolio. Tesla may continue to go up, but at this point consider what has to happen for it to become a $2T or $3T company and whether that risk/upside is worth it against just buying an index. Newsflash, it isn't worth it. Tesla might be escaping scrutiny right now, but at a certain scale they cannot. You're right, they're mainly just a car company at this point, which is a slow growth business, and others are catching up in the EV space. Until they legitimately become more, and those businesses show immense profitability, to me they're just an overblown business. Not a shitco, just valued way too highly."

     "okay so this horse has been beaten over and over again, but here goes: \n\nYou can't just look at a P/E and tell whether a company is fairly valued. You have to look at P/E relative to how fast Earnings are growing. And Tesla's earnings are growing very fast. And it's about to get faster. \n\nThe CapEx for Austin and Berlin is basically done now. The factories are built and the cash has been spent. Every $50,000 car that comes out of each factory has a gross profit of $15,000. \n\nThat's $15k in Gross Profit on 1.4M vehicles this year, 2.2M vehicles next year, 3M+ vehicles in 2024, etc, etc. \n\nThe free cash flow generation of Tesla is WILDLY underestimated (well maybe not because as you said it's holding right in there at a P/E over 50). But my point is that it's deserved. \n\nAny dip should be bought. Even if the economy shits itself, Tesla will rebound strong. EVs are the future. Smart Energy storage via battery packs is the future. Self Driving robotaxis are the future. \n\nBut even if you figure in NONE of those \"pie in the sky\" revenue estimates, the valuation is still realistic JUST ON THE CURRENT EPS GROWTH FROM 2023 - 2026. \n\nThere are plenty of people out there who are wayyyy too optimistic. TSLA will not be at $50T by 2030. It won't be at $25T. But hell.. it could easily be a $10T company by the end of the decade if they can just execute their current growth plan. \n\nFSD/Robots/BatteryPacks.. those are all just free call options you get for buying the stock today."

     "I'm getting a little tired of trying to explain this using projections, numbers, analysis, etc., only to receive \"whatever, it's still overvalued\" with no arguments or simply no reply from the person you replied to at all.\n\nBut since you seem to be genuinely trying to understand, I'll add some more numbers-based analyses that will hopefully show you that Tesla is far from overvalued.\n\nFirst off, let's look at some short term numbers. Tesla in H1 2022 has sold ~550K cars, at ASPs of $57K and a net operating margin of ~17%. On top of that they had some other earnings, but let's ignore that for now. This adds up to ~$5.3B in net income.\n\nFor H2, Shanghai was recently upgraded and is now producing ~85K cars a month after producing ~120K in July+August. Fremont will probably increase Model S/X production a bit, and otherwise stay the same at ~150K per quarter. Giga Berlin and Texas averaged out at about 1K units per week by the end of Q2. They are both slowly ramping up towards 5K per week by the end of the year, so let's average that out at 3K per week.\n\nAdding all of those up, they should be delivering ~838K cars in H2. ASPs will increase a bit, since the latest price increases did not hit sales yet due to the long order backlog, so let's estimate ~$58K. Margins should be increasing too, since Shanghai is a lot more profitable than Fremont and will grow from ~50% of total production to ~65% of total production, so let's low ball it at 21% operating income.\n\nUsing all of those numbers, H2 should be around $10.2B, with total earnings in 2022 coming in at $15.5B. With the current market cap of around $900B, that's a PE of 58 with earnings growing ~182%. That leads to a PEG ratio of 0.32 when 2-3 is normal for large caps. Now naturally Tesla is still quite early into its profitability, so earnings growth will come down over time, but at least in the short term, Tesla is quite cheaply valued.\n\nLooking a bit further out, you can use my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/) to see how even at a $1T market cap, Tesla's on course towards a PE of between 15 and 31. Since that post, Tesla had some pretty big headwinds with the China factory shutdown, but 2023/2024 remain unchanged. I don't believe that those kinds of PEs have ever happened for a company growing earnings at ~50% a year, especially a large cap. Nor would a PEG of 0.3-0.6 make sense. So safe to say even in the mid term, through 2024, Tesla's stock is very cheap and will need to go up significantly before we get there.\n\nNow of course looking out even further, you get into FSD, Tesla Bot, Energy, compact car, Autobidder, etc. territory. I've done plenty of research to be confident that many if not all of those products will become successful as well, and that people will look back at the \"Tesla is just a car company\" argument with complete disbelief in 5-10 years. But even if you don't believe any of that, and you don't want to look more than 3 years out into the future, I believe my numbers above show how Tesla is a huge bargain right now and has at least 100% upside between now and the end of 2024."

And individual sell was great for phone manufacturers before and they currently are for cars. But if you can build an ecosystem you can lock in future dominance instead of decades of constant changing. No car manufacturer has come close to the dominance Apple has had with the iPhone ecosystem over 20 years. If they pull that off they will be worth a lot more than AAPL is. But who knows to what degree they can possibly come close."

Their tech is just better.\n\nNot to mention self driving (my Model S Performance just got FULL SELF DRIVING) activated and while I was happy with regular old autopilot, this is incredible.\n\nSo there's more to it. But it's still silly expensive. You ned 10 straight years of flawless execution and margin protection to get to this being a reasonable valuation. Hard to do.\n\nMicrosoft was 69x earnings in 2000.  It crashed to 8x earnings. For the 22 year period since 2000, they've executed beautifully but not flawlessly.\n\nYour 13 year return had you bought in 2000 was around 6.5% compounded to this year.  Incidentally AAA treasury bonds were yielding about 6.5% back then too. Lot less stress and you could have sold those bonds for a massive capital gain in 2009 and deployed into a 50% off sale on the market."

     "About 1 year ago: (https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/hip0kt7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf): I had written  \u201cI believe 2023 will tell the tale\u201d.  I think it is still so.  At that time TSLA market cap was about $1.1 Trillion.  And as of right now it is about $644 billion.  Of course some of this is to the macro environment: inflation, higher interest rates, etc.  But some has to do with market not knowing the next 1 to 3 years of Tesla revenue/earnings.   I still think the appetite for expensive cars is fairly finite.  However, what I didn\u2019t anticipate was the IRA: I think this will help Tesla quite a bit.  If Tesla vehicles qualify: it will reduce the cost quite a bit and so demand in the USA will probably not be an issue.  I will address some points as I did 1 year ago:\n\n1) USA: as above: Tesla won\u2019t have issues here: it is just a matter of how much production they can do in Fremont and Austin.  ~~The expensive model y and 3 will be less expensive if they indeed qualify for the whole $7500 credit (because there is some battery component issue??~~  (I am not a tax advisor so please ask tax advisor if Tesla qualifies for $7500 credit or not).  ~~So this is a change of my view.~~  I do still believe people will still buy the Rav-4, CR-V, etc\u2026Also, there is a little more competition with the Mach E and soon made in Tennessee ID4\u2026however, this does kinda\u2019 gets cancelled out by the Ioniq5/EV6 that won\u2019t qualify for the tax credit so the sales of those will decline.  Bolt, Lightning, Rivian, Lucid: they are not going to produce in enough numbers to take away sales from Tesla.  \n\n2)  China: Ok, this is where the issue lies.  The competition is more fierce this year than last year.  Moreso than I had originally thought.  I know many people think that some of these Chinese companies sell a bunch of these EV and not make money: that is true in some; but the giant bear in china is BYD: they will report an $800-$900 million profit in Q3 2022.  Why is this important?  They are able to sell relatively cheaper cars and still be profitable.  The cars that are going to give Tesla some headaches are: BYD Seal and the upcoming BYD sea lion.  The seal has good range, 0-100 km/hr time, and have a lower price than model 3.  Unlike in the USA: people in China have more choices and will cross shop. In the USA:  we can\u2019t cross shop with model 3; and even with model y: the main competitors are: mach E, ID4, but they aren\u2019t all produced in high numbers yet (EV6/ioniq 5 won\u2019t qualify for tax credit right now so I don\u2019t think it is going to compete much).  However in China: there is a lot of production from not just BYD, but also Xpeng, Nio, and many more others.  \n\n3)  Europe: This is a mix bag. Berlin just started.  There is more competition here than before: moreso than USA, but less than China.  Cars such as Renault Megane didn\u2019t exist 1 year ago.  VW, Stellantis, RMN, BMW are still steady with their EV sales.   For Tesla: UK and Germany is still selling Tesla quite well.  But for whatever reason France and Norway: there is some decline in sales Y-O-Y.  Berlin ramping up will answer the question to the demand in France and Norway.  Netherlands: still hasn\u2019t recovered much.  So the biggest market right now for Europe is UK and Germany.   Electric car incentive will decrease in Germany in 2023: I don\u2019t know how much effect it will have?? \n\n4) Cybertruck: still not out yet.  But this will be a North American vehicle. Too big for Europe\n\n5) So if china demand slows down: tesla can certainly export to other markets: but the other markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore (the richest countries in Asia-Australia):  I don\u2019t think the market for Tesla will be as high as Europe.  \n\n6) Market Cap of $644 billion today (was $1.1 trillion 1 year ago):  TSLA will have to gain 70% to get back to 1.1 trillion.  What is the difference then and now?  Then: a lot of low interest money: remember all those SPACS??  ARKK?  A lot of market exuberance and many companies didn\u2019t trade on fundamentals.   So at today\u2019s market cap: if tesla just grows 10% per year in market cap, TSLA be $1.3 trillion in 7 years. And in 7 years the PE will probably be 25.  That is net income of $52 billion per year.  For a car company: this is difficult.   I think all profits combined in all automotive sector ex-tesla is < $50 billion today (this is just a guess: Toyota + VW is about $30 billion)??  Last year I wrote: \u201cat $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap. To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???\u201d---This year,  the question is will TSLA make $13 billion/quarter in 7 years????\n\n7)  Again, I will reiterate that capitalism has a way for a product to find the lowest price with a given quality.  Competition creeps up slowly.  Feds have been tightening money supply with higher interest rates.  Higher interest rates and probable upcoming recession may have some effect on Tesla overall sales.  Time will tell.   \n\n8)  I think 2023 will be the year that we will have a lot more answers to many questions: what is the intrinsic demand in Europe/is the demand really softened in France and Norway? Is the demand slowed down in China?  Also, will Tesla cut prices in China (this will affect margins)?  To get to 2.6 million cars (bear case) produced in 2024, I think Tesla has to build another factory?   As of right now, there hasn\u2019t been an announcement. It takes a while to build a factory. \n\n9) My opinion: USA: demand won\u2019t be an issue.  China: demand will soften. Europe: demand will soften but less so than China.  I am excited to see what 2023 brings to Tesla.\n\nEdit: I am really unsure if tesla model y and 3 will qualify for tax credit or not (so I struck that out above).   Regardless, I don't think Tesla will have much demand problem in the USA: mainly due to not enough competitors."

     "The problem I see with this analysis is that it primarily takes past data and extrapolates that, assuming Tesla will be able to sell everything it makes and at similar margins.  It doesn't take into account competition, TAM by segment, etc.\n\nMost of Tesla's sales are Model 3 and Model Y, which are its lowest-priced cars but still quite expensive.  Is there enough market--even accounting for increased popularity of Evs--for Tesla sales to grow that much and still maintain their margins?  That is the analysis I'd like to see.  I am not sure of prices elsewhere, but the cheaper EVs here in Canada like the IONIQ 5 are around $15K cheaper than a Tesla (mid 40K range compared to Tesla low 60K range).  That makes a Tesla about 30% more expensive to buy which is pretty big.  As Tesla's sales grow they are eventually going to run out of buyers willing/able to pay that kind of price premium even if EV sales are growing rapidly.\n\nSo one would expect either Tesla's sales to peak as they (and oncoming competition) saturate their market at that price level, or else Tesla needs to start selling a whole lot of cheaper cars which means either serious margin reductions or else cutting costs significantly to keep their margins.\n\nAnyway the demand side including what the competition is doing is what I really want to see in a Tesla analysis. Just asserting that they can sell everything they make and at the same margins for a higher-priced product would need a lot of backing to that argument no matter the industry."

Guy is always on a barbell port with tail risk puts, so take it with a grain of salt but he's saying something I'm hearing more and more.  \n\nWe need a culture change where society expects managing money to be our main job and our main job secondary when it should be the reverse.  The purpose of money management is to preserve wealth first and foremost from our productive hard work, not moving money around.\n\nThere's too many really smart people, especially young, focused on either managing their money or others rather than creating something of value for society.  According to him, the problem is that the there's a constant battle between the prudent and the \"winners\" who are foolish risktakers that eventually blow up but are constantly replaced by a new crop that want to perpetuate this culture.\n\nEdit: to add further onto this, I believe an overly accommodative Fed for last several decades have massively made this problem worse."

There are some countries/companies that are choosing the sell their oil right away (instead of storing it) because they can currently get 4% return on their cash. Another is that the Saudi's have been cutting production, but they tend to produce a more sulfurous / sour oil. The US and Brazil are \"making up\" for their cuts with actual \"sweet\" crude, which is easier to refine."

     "Well, they raised about 220 million dollars at IPO (in 2010). If you factor in the 15:1 stock splits we've had so far that would be 1.13$-ish per share. There was some media stuff about it since Tesla was the first auto manufacturer to go public in....forever, but I don't think a lot of regular people beyond the eco-crowd saw this as something to invest in - much less count on as making a huge profit some time down the road.\n\n(Heck, I dumped some money into Tesla in 2019 and I didn't do it for profits - I just didn't want to see the company fail. I was aware of Tesla before then but Roadster/Model S and Model X were 'toys for the rich' so I didn't give the company much thought until they brought out the Model 3)\n\nToyota held 50mn $ worth (of the roughly 225mn dollars raised during IPO) and I think Mercedes still owned a healthy chunk of Tesla at the time (also around 50mn $ IIRC?). Both must be kicking themselves that they eventually sold (I think Mercedes sold their share for 500mn $). That 50mn stock package back then would now be worth about 5bn$ today."

Tesla also has new factories in Austin, Texas, and Berlin, which Musk in June referred to as money furnaces. The Shanghai factory opened in 2018, but it has been plagued by temporary shutdowns due to COVID-19 restrictions and parts shortages. In July, Tesla said it delivered nearly 255,000 vehicles in the second quarter, down about 18% from the previous quarter. Still, the electric-auto maker beat Wall Streets expectations in its second-quarter earnings, defying projections that Shanghai shutdowns would hurt its bottom line. \\n\\nWhen earnings were released, Musk sa'",

     "To be honest, I don\u2019t believe anyone understands the transport industry on Reddit. Companies purchase heavy vehicles in order to turn a profit. End of story. There is no wow factor. All manufacturers offer a slightly varying product. Some are designed for heavy spec, ie paccar(Kenworth and Peterbilt). Others are designed for traditional use such as Freightliner and Volvo.\n\nFurthermore, the Tesla semi\u2019s are day cabs. They are not the traditional sleeper we associate with a semi. The shape and structure are very misleading in this regard. The average accident involving a heavy vehicle in the unites states for 2021 was $148,279. Now imagine your semi is a Tesla, a $400,000 dollar vehicle. More than twice the price of a typical day cab. Insurance premiums for fleets are above $20,000 per vehicle as is. If you started adding vehicles to your fleet that are driven by the worst drivers in the industry, it is guaranteed your premiums would be considerably higher. I say this because the drivers with the lowest turnover and insurance premiums are long distance drivers and non traditional loads(heavy spec, flat deck, step deck, drop frame\u2026 etc.\n\nThe end of the day corporations only care about ROI. In transport the margins are razor thin. If a Tesla provides a better ROI than traditional manufacturers, I could understand the hype surrounding this vehicle.\n\nEdit. Im being downvoted for stating facts. Stocks is becoming wsb 2.0. I am not for or against Tesla when it comes to investing. I don't factor emotion into the decision. If there is a path forward for Tesla to be successful in the space then I am very intrigued. If someone can outline a path to this success I am very intrigued to learn."

Because of this, it is a lot easier to enter into contracts with local bottlers, so sodas in their finished form don't have nearly as far to travel."

It's continuously getting better. Giga Shanghai is way better than Fremont (former legacy OEM factory), Berlin and Texas are again improved compared to Giga Shanghai which also was recently further optimized. Which might not sound crazy, but it enables Tesla to produce 500k cars out of a factory that a legacy OEM could only get 300k out of. Now you tell me about the cost structures of both vehicles. \n\nThere is no use in producing 2 models at a 300k annual run rate at two different production sites when you can produce one model at 600k annual rr out of one site. Not only are the directly attributed fix costs significantly less, the entire logistics become so much easier as well. \n\nFurther points are issues like vertical integration. Yes, BMW and Daimler are seemingly catching up in many aspects of BEVs, BUT: they do so with heavy reliance (core parts of BEVs, not easily interchangeable parts) on Bosch, Continental, and more. And they all get their piece of the cake. Same with VWs planned battery plants. Most (if not all) are joint ventures for which VW actively seeks outside funding and business partners. They all will get their margins.\n\nEspecially troubling are issues like software. Yes, VW has been hell bent to catch up with its software, but Cariad has not been a success story so far and already needs outside help, won't achieve its 2025 goals (according to VW themselves) and costs VW indirectly money in the meantime (through lack of OTA updates and more). All the while employing more software developers than Tesla does (excl. FSD projects). Add being locked in in the dealership structure and other issues, and you will see that legacy OEMs are facing lower margins, huge upfront expenditures (investments) and depreciation, dependency on key suppliers and more. \n\nWe have yet to see a legacy OEM ramp up EV production the way Tesla does. Only real competition on that part is BYD for example.\n\nHigher quality trims, better finishing and a larger product portfolio are not exactly a guarantee of success in such a fundamental transition. That's just my take on it. Feel free to argue otherwise, I'd be happy to hear opposing views to this as long as they are not just high level buzz words."

I recommend this community to get series about it - [https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-tsla-the-investment-world-the-perpetual-investors-roundtable.139047/page-18185](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/tesla-tsla-the-investment-world-the-perpetual-investors-roundtable.139047/page-18185)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n99% of people who read this comment won't watch/read the info I just linked to, which is why the few of us who do (and did) made a killing in Tesla, and will continue to make a killing while the uninformed run off and scream \"oVerPrIceD MeMe\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't have the desire to write up  a 15,000 word response, especially when others explain much more eloquently than me. So I'm just gonna sparknotes some inmportant points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Tesla has a 15+ year head start on modern day EV assembly. They're playing a TOTALLY different game than competitors. OTher companies are asking \"how do we get a car at the same specs as a Tesla that's profitable?\" While Tesla is asking \"how few batteries can you put in a car so we can ship as many as possible?\"\n2. EVs require a completely different field of engineering, rendering much of the workforce and infrastructure of legacy manufacturers largely useless (and an active hinderince, like in unions, cuz EV transition = union employees lose jobs).\n3. Other manufacturers can't reach profitability with EVs while Tesla has iPhone-level margins on its cars. LIke...wrap your head around that. IT's unheard of, there's no industry comparison. And other companies can't simply \"focus\" on EVs and magically reach that same level of profitability.\n4. Tesla's software advantage. Yes, other luxury cars might have nice interior buttons, but the software experience is MILES apart, and it's so painfully apparent. This is a 5000+ post alone. You should research it.\n5. Tesla's vertical integration. There's a reason the US passed a multi-billion dollar bill to secure the battery supply. Good video here on how fucked the US is by relying on China so much - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUxO3TAp2DM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUxO3TAp2DM) Tesla's the only company that is taking major vertical integration steps like creating its on cathode refining facility and supporting miners.\n\n\"Cool...but other luxury car makers are gonna make fancy cars and people will prefer that to Teslas because buttons and standing out.\"\n\nLike...okay. Let's see how well niche manufacturing of $150,000+ cars on sub 15% gross margin works out and how many people will wanna buy those (with inferior specs). There will always be people who want inferior products for same intangible brand reason (looking at you Jeep), but how consequential is that? We're on an investing forum, and the Tesla Model S basically outperforms 99% of all $1 million+ super cars. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpC\\_AoSnPrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpC_AoSnPrQ) this is basic? This is not fun? IDK. Bring a Tesla to any elementary school and see the kids' reactions. That will tell you all you need to know about the Tesla brand prestige.\n\nThis is not including the roadster, which will have possibly low 1s in 0-60 acceleration, 500+ miles of range, and maybe even have SpaceX rocket thrusters on it in order to achieve its speeds.\n\nIf Tesla sells 20 million cars in 2030 on 20% gross margin, it will be the largest company in the world, point blank.\n\nAnd yes...Tesla energy will be as big as Tesla cars. Very clear pathway for that. Forget largest company in the world, Tesla's basically the modern day East India Company"

Not just battery factories planned someday like every OEM thinks they are going to do. Real contacts with mines to keep up with Teslas growth plans. Tesla has them locked down\n\nCharging Network - Self explanatory. Everyone else is fucked with charging right now and that's not changing anytime soon. Best case soon OEMs start using Teslas network and then their customers are in Teslas ecosystem. Tesla wins again.\n\nBrand Power - Kids/teenagers/college age are the trend setters and they are obsessed with Tesla. Just like iPhones\n\nVertical Integration - No one but rivian is vertically integrated like Tesla is. Tesla can do lighting fast ota updates, late supply chip changes by writing new firmware, not wait or rely on apple / Google etc for infotainment, unlimited software support due to not having vendor contracts with monopolistic companies like qualcomm"

Particularly VPPs could be a neat money maker. \n\nOthers are making EVs too, but have you looked at the volumes? Before the ICE market is eaten up there's also no real argument to be made with regards to \"competition is coming\". As long as there's more demand than supply the entire concept of 'competition' makes no sense. \n\nTesla has THE global charging network which they will open up - so they will be making money off the automotive market at both ends. \n\nWith the different corporate culture I also can't really see anyone catching up when it comes to tech and added value to the customer (People are beginning to notice that Tesla keeps giving their customers really useful goodies for free after sale).\n\nI'm not counting on FSD, bot or robotaxi.

For example, look at the evolution from the Model 3 body (2017), to the Model Y (2020), and Model Y (2022) [https://youtu.be/dyde8G7mp-4](https://youtu.be/dyde8G7mp-4).  \n\nThey're completely re-writing the playbook on how to design and mass manufacture a vehicle.  Everything from the HVAC and cooling system to electrical architecture in a Tesla is becoming better and cheaper, at a faster rate than anyone else.  \n\nThis is allowing Tesla to scale its manufacturing operations more quickly and more economically than other businesses.  They can achieve higher profit margins as a result. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2) Energy\n\nTesla Megapacks are becoming more and more commonplace in power grids globally.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n(3) Artificial Intelligence \n\nIt's not just autonomous vehicles.  Autobidder managment software ties into Tesla Energy products.  If the Dojo platform succeeds, Tesla could theoretically train its future bots to do any general physical labor task.   Tesla could also sell time on the Dojo platform for others to train their Machine Learning algorithms. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, Tesla sits at the intersection of heavy manufacturing, energy, and artificial intelligence.  This has the potential to radically alter the physical landscape of civilization at an unprecedented scale.  Imagine the productivity level of a world where AI-driven robots can do almost any task, and derive their energy from abundant, inexpensive renewable energy"

     "I agree with much of what's already been posted in the thread. They're executing well in nearly all areas, including scaling up supply contracts to ramp up their battery supply.\n\nTesla's only lagging in service. The number of store & service locations grew by 20% in Q1, vs. a production increase of 68%.\n\nThe competition is coming, but it's far behind. E.g.: Toyota & BMW, after years of R&D on hydrogen fuel cells, are still hyping Hydrogen. The Toyota Mirai is a compliance car, reliant on a hydrogen infrastructure that primarily exists (sparsely) in California. Where are these hydrogen cars going to refuel elsewhere? Infrastructure is someone else's problem! /s\n\nTesla's Supercharger network continues to expand, although not quickly enough. The Legacy manufacturers wish someone else would build out a third party supercharging network for them. Once Tesla opens up their charging network globally, that will solve that problem for them, but in the intervening time, how many consumers will just buy a Tesla instead? Most will.\n\nHaving a focus on increasing battery supply & improving autonomy, Tesla will continue it's EV supremacy, though the market might not have that clarification for awhile."

They never arrive.\n\nSome day someone will match them on features.\n\nThen the next hurdle is matching them on production volume.\n\nThen the next hurdle will be matching them on profit margin at volume. \n\nNo one is likely to catch them on all three in 10 years.\n\nTesla has gone from two factories to 4... they are still ramping the 2 new factories, so they aren't efficient/printing money yet.  Then they'll be adding more.\n\n> On top of that, they\u2019re pretty basic and not as fun as some of the other brands.\n\nhahaha\n\nno\n\n> If I were to say they\u2019re going to stay on top, it\u2019d be because they focus more on energy storage and shift away from cars.\n\nThey get compared to Apple alot, but they will be more like Microsoft.  Microsoft did not 'shift away from operating systems' to also dominate in business/office applications, gaming systems, cloud hosting, AI, etc.\n\n> I could also see Tesla becoming the next Toyota of cars (cheap but plentiful cars) however I don\u2019t see them competing with upper end brands for much longer.\n\nFor much longer?  They are focusing on ramping and maximizing profits, but I have yet to see an upper end brand that will beat the Roadster 2.0.   Also, Lucid is focusing on 'upper end EVs'.  They got boned by the recent EV act that focuses on encouraging producing/selling cars more in reach of the average person.  \n\nThe market will be a bumpy ride for the next 2-15 months, but it's probably a good time to get into TSLA.  The market crashed today, losing a weeks' worth of gains.  TSLA only lost 2 days of gain (and is well above where it was 5 days ago).  It will have some big down days in the future (with macro) but the lows are likely already in."

     "The problem with TSLA is that cars are a basically commodities and I don't see that changing. \n\nWhat I mean by that is that most people won't buy a TSLA at any price just because it's a TSLA. Right now TSLA has pricing power because there isn't much competition in the EV space, but that's changing.\n\nThe reason companies like GOOG or V can demand high margins is because there's a moat to competition. There's no real moat to EVs. Any company can enter the space and if they produce a decent EV TSLA has to compete with them. This is why the automobile sector generally trades at lower valuations. There's no margin guarantee and there's no guarantee that what you're able sell this year you'll sell next year.\n\nAnd it's not just competition in the automobile space you need to worry about. Cars also compete with public transport. As more people move to cities car ownership will decline in favour of public transport. Trends like this will continue to be a headwind for the entire industry for years to come.\n\nI like TSLA and have invested in the past. It's just right now at the current valuation it's hard to not see a lot of risks with limited upside. You really have to believe in the innovation story today. If Elon can continue to grow the business in new innovative ways then it could be a good investment, but it's not without it's risks."

Range anxiety and inconvenience of charging on the way are real issues, but for most drivers this is only true once in a while.

Extra range beyond that will be useful now and then, but most of the time it's just a heavy ass battery that's not really needed and presumably could have been split across multiple cars.\n\nGiven that PHEVs can offer 90+% of the fuel offset with a battery something like 20% the size (compared with full EVs), why does the world seem so quick to move past PHEVs?"

     "In terms of Tesla vs legacy automaker, there is no competition, not just from the products itself, but also from the backend. Tesla as a company does not have the structures of legacy automakers with their dealership network. This network costs the company a LOT and this means lower profit, but also headaches for customers. The legacy automaker is also projected to have lower profitability than Tesla for the next decade or until whenever the world is mostly EV. This is because they hold on their balance sheets a lot of assets that are related to ICE cars. This has to be written off on a yearly basis, so this means, profitability that is super under pressured. Not only is Tesla more profitable than any other car company right now without these write offs, but once these writeoffs BEGIN (they have not), Tesla's valuation will just demolish all legacy automakers, this is why it should be that Tesla's valuation is way more than legacy automakers because Tesla does not have all these extra costs. Remember that an EV company's valuation is based on the value of their EV business minus the costs to get rid of their ICE business. Because Tesla has no ICE business, it basically will at least double the profitability of the next legacy automaker. The only real competition from an investment standpoint to Tesla is a company like Rivian, NIO, etc.\n\nNow on to the business itself. Tesla has basically almost a monopoly on batteries. Even legacy automakers like Benz is not able to get batteries as much as Tesla can. If you want to order an EV from them, its also on wait list, mostly because they dont have the parts to fulfill the demand, and this is not going to change anytime soon. Tesla not only have secured supply but the newest tech in battery. Think about it, if you are a battery company, which company would you want to supply? Benz that buys 25k batteries from your per year, or Tesla that will buy 1.5M? Off course you will approach Tesla first. Tesla also is producing their cars at lower cost for the same build quality due to their innovation in manufacturing. I own both a Tesla and a Benz, their build quality now is similar, its just that people do not scrutinize Benz build quality as they just trust it already, but Benz has as much panel gaps and even more than my Tesla lol, but when you buy a Benz, you dont spend like an hour at the dealer using your flashlight scrutinizing every paint defect, and then another 6 hours at home going through a checklist.\n\nTechnology, Tesla is also still ahead. Which car company that is a real competitor today has a similar offering to Tesla's screen? Even the new EQS from benz, has lags and clutter. Which car also have access to something similar to a supercharger network. Many people love the ioniq 5 and even Rivian, but unless you own your own home, you will need to rely on these charging stations, read what people are experiencing, its not bad, but definitely not as good as Tesla's and it will not show noticeable improvements until maybe 2 years from now, or if Tesla starts opening up their supercharger network.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are more, but really today if you are buying an EV, currently Tesla's true competitors are the Hyunda Kia cars and Rivian. The other cars will sell, but Tesla does not need to sell the most cars to be the number one carmaker. Next year the Model Y is projected to be the best selling car in the world in terms of units. In 2022, it already is the best selling car based on Revenue. There are many points that I have left out as it would be too long of a reply, but all signs still showing to Tesla dominance in the next 5 years unless Rivian starts ramping up like crazy, or NIO comes stateside, IONIQ5s can scale faster, etc, which is not happening soon. No matter how good the Hyunda Kia cars are, they are not a real contender for investment for the reasons i mentioned in the first paragraph above."

We all know Tesla is doing well and expansion and growth is continuing. That\u2019s why the price is already so high. \n\nEveryone on here is so confident of their read on the situation. Like, maybe the TSLA fans are right and in 10 years the global market is 95% EV and TSLA has 60% of that market. In that case then they\u2019re probably undervalued today and an amazing buy. But also maybe the bears are right and in 10 years the market is stuck at like 15-20% EV and Tesla only has 20% of the market. Personally, I reckon it will be somewhere in the middle and TSLA has some upside, but not enough to make it a buy for me."

Anyone that steps into a dealership of competitors will run home and book a Tesla. \n\nThat said, I already have a Model S and bought a Model Y for my wife in Jan and quickly sold it (for loss 10% of price in sales tax) because my wife hated the ride quality (noise and vibrations). I couldn\u2019t find much fault myself either. The vehicle drove like shit on the freeway and the interiors looked cheap too.\n\nSince then, I booked a VW ID.4 and test drive it.

     "I think it\u2019s already undervalued and overdue for a significant bounce. Here\u2019s why:\n\nThis year, Tesla will post ~$10B free cash flow (up 100% from last year, 258% from 2 years ago, and 827% from 3 years ago). Now let\u2019s do a simple and conservative 10 year discounted cash flow with the following assumptions:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060\u206012% discount rate in the 10 year period\n2.\t\u2060\u2060\u20608% terminal discount rate\n3.\t\u2060\u2060\u20603% terminal growth rate inline with GDP growth, and less than half S&P 500 long term earnings growth rate.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060\u206040% free cash flow growth in the first year that glides down linearly to 3% over the 10 years. This averages out to a compound annual growth rate of 23%, which is similar to Apple/Google over the 10 years after they first reached ~$10b FCF.\n\nThe result of such a DCF is a present value of $190 per share with quite conservative assumptions. There is plenty of upside: increase the growth rate in the 10 year period or the terminal period, decrease the discount rate to be more inline with S&P 500 returns, and you can make bull cases several times higher than today\u2019s Tesla price."

     "I am a software engineer and lately I\u2019ve been doing data science things. My employer says I\u2019m a data scientist but I don\u2019t really agree. But I do do a little bit of that as part of my job. In my relatively short time (1 year) doing ML/AI/data science things for my job, it seems to me that while all theoretically possible, the tools to get to things like self-driving cars don\u2019t exist in the same way that tools for making an iOS app exist. Also, you can Google how to make an iOS app all day long, but in my day to day work I find it\u2019s common to just not find anything on the internet about what I\u2019m trying to build or do with ML/AI. \n\nI think it\u2019s only a matter of time before Teslas really do drive themselves without any sort of disclaimer or asterisk attached. \n\nPart of it is in software as much as we try, we can\u2019t always find all the bugs before going to production and releasing code to the users\u2026 and that\u2019s for web apps. To thoroughly test Autopilot\u2026 I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s realistic. I think there will be more Autopilot crashes/cases where it didn\u2019t do what it was expected or supposed to do. Is what it is. Airplanes took a few decades of disaster before all the kinks were worked out. At this point, if a commercial plane crashes it\u2019s almost certainly pilot error. Pilots (people) fly planes, and people write software like Autopilot. We aren\u2019t perfect so Autopilot won\u2019t be either, for a time anyway.\n\nAlso, people like to wax about how TSLA is worth X because they have the largest network of charging stations in the US. That\u2019s definitely worth something, but even more so is the IP that is Autopilot. Ford and others will spend TRILLIONS building their own self-driving hardware and software, and those will all have accidents too, unless Tesla decides to sell the Autopilot tech, but that doesn\u2019t seem likely."

     "Maybe a bad press week, but the reality is this company is light years ahead of the competition.  The charging network is the strategic advantage - just as iTunes was (and now the App Store) is Apples strategic advantage.  Prior to iPod there were dozens (maybe hundreds) of MP3 players, but grandma wasn\u2019t about to go to a Russian website for free music and then figure out how to get it on the device.  iTunes made it easy to get tunes and apps in one place and it just works with iPod/iPhone/iPad.  If you haven\u2019t got an EV today, you have no idea what the difference is finding charging for an non-Tesla EV vs a Tesla.  With Tesla, I show up and plug in.  With other networks, I need a special app to find a charger, another app to start /pay for the charging, and (assuming the station actually works) I likely have to have an adapter.  It\u2019s a major pain in the ass that Ford/GM/Toyota/etc won\u2019t invest in until it\u2019s much too late/expense to catch up anytime soon."

Right now beyond that, stock is down along with other large-cap growth stocks (similarly to NVDA)\n\nI would still recommending holding TSLA because fundamentally the latest earnings have crushed ests and (ignoring any obvious optimism on timelines\u2026) the FSD and enabling software are enormous potential value.

Musk is too smart to believe that Trump is innocent so he has started becoming a fascist, not just a republican. He is down with Bolsonaro in Brazil now, and it is NOT to save the rain forest it is to confab with a fellow fascist.  This neo fascism of Musk's also badly soils spaceX and would crater twitter if he succeeds in taking it over, but I bet they stop him now, then sue him for 20 billion."

Whats interesting is they've done it using standard Li technology and a new electrolyte. \n\nAnd what are the main risks? The next step change will be to use microcontrollers to optimize the power drawn from separate Li and Na batteries. This will get us another 20-30 per cent.

Like if intel just magically got their act together or who knows? So that's option one the second one is some disruptive business. People are looking at EV charging stations as a potential boom cycle but I kind of wonder how much growth and valuation you can really put in a gas station? I don't think we really have any clear leadership yet because we don't even know what the leadership sector is going to be for the next bull market.

     "Might be better to look at what the hot new thing might be.\n\nI hate to admit it, but possibly that's virtual reality stuff.  Maybe they get over their hurdles of being an expensive geek toy, and take over the world, like computers did.  Trouble is computers started out being useful, and then became a toy.  What started as a toy and became useful?  Phones maybe?\n\nTrouble with investing in this space is Meta is just a hard nope.    Their hugeness and their history, mean it won't be them, they had their time in the son, and made a mess of it.\n\nMSFT is kind of a secret player here.  Could be what they were thinking when buying Activision.  They have branded goggles.  They have Teams.   They have a gaming ecosystem.  They are well positioned, but, they are big name, last wave's news.     Same with AAPL, like they made pocket computers cool, and desperately need something new to continue to justify their price.  If anyone can bring this stuff to the masses, it's them.  This next thing though is already priced in, everyone has AAPL because they think AAPL is going to do something cool again, like with the Mac and then the iPhone.\n\n\nWhat you'd want though, which I don't see or know about, is the scrappy little company that hasn't made it yet that becomes the dominant player in this space, like TSLA or Spotify did.     That might be the next thing to watch for.  On the other hand, has that company already been bought by a big player?   Has the world changed so we don't get a new whatever, it's at best the brand of a big player?\n\nAs for something else, I wish I knew.  What's the problem that needs to be solved, and who's solving it in some clever way?"

     "Like you said in your edit, it's most likely not already a big 500b+ company like the ones in your title.\n\nMy call is it will be NIO. [Here](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-chinas-electric-drive-swappable-car-batteries-2022-03-24/) is an article that reflects my thinking. The whole EV industry acts as if fast charging is going to \"improve\" and that battery swapping is irrelevant. Those who make those claims completely miss the point and ignore reality. Charging speed could improve, but it could also get worse. \"How is that possible?\" you and every moron Telsa Boi might ask. Well, it's simple. There are already batteries in existence that can allow a Tesla to go over 750 miles on a single charge. Why hasn't Tesla implemented these? Longer charge times and faster degradation. The \"longest range\" batteries require materials that only last for a few recharge cycles so putting them in a Tesla would mean the car would only last a couple years before the battery was completely wiped out. NIO will never have that problem. They will always be able to use the latest and greatest battery technology - even if that means single-use batteries (which do exist btw) that have some crazy 2500 mile range. Tesla does not have that flexibility. Tesla has to worry about how many recharge cycles the battery can withstand without significant degradation and so they are forced to forgo certain battery configurations that would allow them to achieve 750 mile range. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM are not researching battery swap tech because they believe that is not what the market wants, because the market leader (Tesla) says so. Everyone is just following Papa Elon's lead like he's Einstein. Newsflash: Even Einstein was wrong sometimes. The fact that the whole industry is blindly playing follow the leader should tell you something.\n\nAlso, Tesla's P/S is about 30x, while NIO's P/S is less than 10x even though Tesla is a megacap company and NIO is only $25B (normally, growth stage companies have much higher P/S because their sales are expect to \"grow\" while larger companies have lower P/S because their sales are approaching maturity)..\n\nIn the next 5 years, NIO is going to flood the US market with premium quality low cost EVs and everyone's going to say \"I missed NIO but at least I didn't invest in Tesla\""

Bought a used 2020 Model S, 6K miles,  w/Ludicrous mode and FSD Beta, so that will clue you to my income level. Married, no children, 50+ years old. Owned a 2015 BMW M3 bought new and shipped from Germany. That car needed over $15K of work (at 65K miles) to replace engine and transmission seals. The carbon fiber dash cover was melting up off the dash and coming loose in other areas too. The driver's side arm rest on the door had gone all gooey in back so you had to grab it carefully to close the door so you wouldn't get some sticky black crap on your fingers. Oh, and the iDrive Display was delaminating on the inside. Other than that, great car. I traded it for my Tesla which I purchased for the following reasons: 1) Takes off like a raped ape (I am proud to own a frickin' SUPERCAR!) and the technology that went into the car is amazing, 2) My wife liked the body style, paint color and wheel/tire size, 3) Didn't care about a test drive because we heard great things about Tesla's from acquaintances who owned different models that they bought years ago (early adopters), 4) Zero emissions, 5) I'm a bit of an Assburger myself and like Elon, 6) No gasoline, just plug it in, 7) SAVE THE PLANET! We do still have an ICE vehicle because we think it would be impractical to try to drive a Tesla up to Philadelphia and the Poconos (especially through S.

     "Yeah I mean as a car guy the thing I respect most about teslas is that (at least originally) the value proposition was that you're getting a great car, that happened to be electric. The roadster had a tough time with that because batteries are very heavy, which made it difficult as a performance vehicle, but the application was niche enough and the acceleration good enough that it gained traction. Next market segment was luxury automobiles and this was a highly profitable market segment to penetrate (and apart from Elon's miscues surrounding his obstinance around the model X), because margins are still very high for luxury automobiles, but electric drivetrains offer a number of key differentiators along key criteria within the value proposition of a luxury car. First and foremost, they're quiet. Weight isn't as much of an issue because luxury car drivers typically don't desire the same number of lateral Gs as sports car drivers. Range isn't nearly as much of a concern in daily driving (especially for well heeled drivers who likely live near their place of employment) as it is for sports car drivers as well (who probably want to go balls out for 4-6 hours at a time around a track).\n\nElectric cars are more efficient from an engineering perspective if not for the pesky battery issue. I'm honestly kind of surprised there wasn't a \"tweener\" car with a gas motor powering a generator driving electric motors. Fisker had something along those lines but I think it was a complicated system where the engine could drive the wheels as well as the generator. I'm just talking here about replacing the battery with a small 1-cylinder gas or diesel engine. \n\nBut at any rate, as someone who doesn't align very well with either side of the political spectrum (pro weed/hamsterdam from the wire really, pro choice, pro guns, pro \"supply and demand\" economics insofar as we recognize that behavioral economics is literally like the missing piece of efficient markets hypothesis and we need to approach legislation generally with the assumption that we're governing a bunch of coked up chimpanzees, pro globalization, pro \\*obscene\\* competitiveness in education, anti private company subsidies, federal government should be like the 50 states starting a gofundme for nukes, testing standards to prevent tainted alcohol, and hypersonic fighter jets), I can tell you that I respect the inventiveness of elon musk in his brand alignment of tesla. \n\nWould I buy a prius? I mean I drove one for a while for a job, it's fine, yeah if someone parked one in my driveway and said here's your complementary car, I'd drive it for sure. Nothing against the prius. But if I had $120k sitting around (refuse to take on that kind of financial obligation for what is a depreciating asset during normal economic times) I would buy a model S. I'd love to buy a cybertruck, but that's going to take a few years.\n\nI say all of that partially as a feeble attempt to demonstrate my intelligence to strangers on the internet, but also to say that I agree that there's not the same kind of hardcore brand alignment between greenpeace and tesla as there is between greenpeace and bamboo rickshaws."

     "So what you're saying is that Elon Musk did the flip to grow his consumer base because there are more there that can afford his product? Sounds legit. \n\nThere are a couple issues with the assumptions. Firstly, EV's are spectacularly heavy and to combat all that extra weight, \"aero\" or as it's also known as aerodynamics becomes a major function in the design. Therefore, styling becomes pretty universal and common between vehicles. Look at the similarities between the Tesla Model 3, the Porche Taycon, and the Toyota Miria. The hatchback models contain similarities. \n\nThere's also no legitimate \"Go Green!\" being aired constantly across any radio station. HOWEVER... there is a constant drowning against EVs on conservative talk radio. Their main message, \"Don't buy.\" Just turn on any FOX station to hear it.\n\nLastly, there's the explosion of new EVs coming to market: For F150 Lighting, Rivian, GM Hummer EV, Ram EV, Chevy Volt, Volkswagen, Porche, BMW. Polstar, China BYD, Li auto, NIO, Xpeng. Therefore there are more and more choices for the consumer. Of course with all these new competitors, comes demand for raw materials: Lithium, cobalt, magnesium, aluminum, and more. These raw materials have skyrocketed in price due to that. \n\nFortunately, advancements in battery technologies is under way. China, who seams to be cutting ties with Tesla in favor of their home grown companies (this is an interesting read btw) is developing sodium base batteries that are cheaper to make, recycle, and larger operation range. India is experimenting with Aluminum-Air batteries that you swap at \"EV-stations\" for a full charge in less than 3 minutes. Very interesting stuff really. Let's also not forget the Toyota Hydrogen Engines. \n\nWhen it comes to vehicles, the one to actually pay attention to is Toyota btw. Toyota is very conservative in terms of presenting reliable technology historically. Toyota is also constantly in contact with its consumers to engineer immediate improvements. Why? They do this from \"lessons learned.\" You don't become the world's largest vehicle manufacturer by sitting on your hands. You do it by listening, learning, and improving. That's something that Tesla is getting a reputation for not doing. Just watch YouTube.\n\nSo Elon Musk transition of his consumer base is an actual No-Brainer. Right now EV companies are in a race to be \"the one.\" Tesla is loosing ground. To combat that, there's little to no choice but to try to appeal to a more higher dollar owning base."

This corruption shows up in the quality of raw materials. Unscrupulous vendors will sell rare-earth raw materials that are diluted heavily with fake materials to make the raw materials seem normal. When in fact they could be diluted by 25-50%. \n\nThis dilution is part of the reason China\u2019s chips and semiconductors are not in demand compared to japan or other chip/semi conductor manufacturing countries. Taiwan even eats their lunch over chips and semiconductors.\n\nChina has a reputation problem with their semi conductors and microchips.\n\nThe primary reason why large companies like Tesla will not exclusively buy China\u2019s semiconductors is because of the low Quality Assurance rates in the finished product. Due to the lack of quality raw materials, the components themselves have a significant reputation for failure. \n\nThis is also the reason why Apple, (when they manufacture iPhones in China)ship all key semiconductor and chip sets for their phones to the China manufacturing plants and do not buy these materials directly from China. With would be far cheaper than shipping these components from overseas plants."

Combine that with the same company providing complimentary products and services that increase their revenue. Combine that with the same company vertically integrating to reduce costs and increase their technological lead.

That said I came up with the demand of 30.9 GigaWatts to charge 14.2 million BEV's over a course of 7.2 hours.  30.9 GW is the entire capacity built in 2018.  I used datasheets of charging equipment and cars, and researched grid capacity and construction\n\nSo by 2018's power construction rate, if they did nothing but support BEV growth, there would be nothing left to support society's growing power needs.\n\nIpso facto new wind power and nat gas fired power plants must be built at a faster rate.\n\nGeneral Electric and Siemens have a duopoly in capital equipment for power generation.  No EV maker has that for sure.\n\nMoreover, as a percentage of current sales, GE would receive twice the boost to its stock price vs Siemens.\n\nDon't let the nat gas turbine's use of fossil fuels fool you.  I think nat gas turbines will still sell.  The BEV people wanting the virtue signaling will be doing one thing, and the businesses doing whatever it takes to generate that power for a profit will be doing another thing."

As far as competition goes, have you ever seen a VW or a GM electric vehicle They are disastrous in every way. They are more expensive for less range speed and features. And don't even get me started on their software. \n\nDo yourself a favour rent a Tesla for a week, and maybe then you will start to get it. its like when apple iPhone came along people like you kept saying keyboard is the future, or Nokia or blackberry will just copy them and kill Apple.

     "I agree that the valuation seems unreal, but what isn\u2019t factored into your analysis is retail. Who takes the biggest cut of any product chain? Retail. \n\n\nThe other carmakers are producers and wholesalers. Products are subsidized at both wholesale and retail transaction points then the independent retail network  gets the vehicle transaction gross profit, any wholesale incentives, oftentimes pocketing the retail incentive as well through the \u201cbargaining\u201d process, and they take finance & insurance income. Following this, dealers earn on retail and wholesale parts distribution in their areas and on after sales service in their shops. \n\n\nALL of that income belongs to Tesla, and that is just the pure automotive division. \n\n\nMost automotive retail is still privately held, so industry volumes are understated. [NADA](https://www.nada.org/nadadata/), the National Automotive Dealers Association, reports that in 2020 total dealership sales dipped back below $1T USD after three years above the trillion mark. They employ $1.1 million people and nearly all have independent contracts for advertising, computer systems and many other expenses, without economy of scale to bargain with. The average dealership nets 3.6% of sales before income tax. Imagine what they could do with fixed retail pricing, national buying power and without the concern of competing against other dealers of the same brand\u2026\n\n\nSo Tesla has insourced retail and at 1% of volume that portion of the business is worth ~$360M net per year conservatively - not considering the better margins and lack of inside competition. \n\n\nFurther icing on the cake is that Tesla has also insourced design and manufacturing of most components, compared with anywhere from 30-100% being outsourced by other brands. (Yes, some vehicles are built 100% by a company other than the brand whose badge they bear - and not just the internal badge engineering we see from the big three) The fact that Panasonic builds Tesla batteries in dedicated plants in the US is notable, but still small potatoes compared to nearly every other brand. \n\n\nTraditional carmakers are really no comparison for this company, or any other new manufacturers that take on the insourcing model. Especially as some have begin to open-source some of the IP, the key benefits of sub-manufacturing diminish. Meanwhile, the outgoing heavy-hitters are locked in a death-struggle between unions, suppliers and dealers all refusing to give up their piece, which results in much slower progress and innovation in almost every facet of the business.\n\nThese are just a few of the reasons speculation is more justified than first meets the eye. A trillion? Maybe not, but Tesla has just crossed over the break even point in 2019 and is ready to pass Ford in net income with a mere fraction of the volume. Right now their only limiter on profit is how fast they can produce more vehicles."

They like throwing around their marketing hype of \"2 million real world miles driven\" and \"billions of simulated miles driven\" but all of that ignored two key facts:\n\n(1) Waymo has experimented on a very limited set of roads. Maybe like 10 different cities, tops. Even if they actually did experiment with let's say an order of magnitude higher # of cities, Tesla gets millions of miles worth of driving data across almost every single place in the US every month. \n\n(2) reaching that stage 4/5 self driving requires a lot of precomputation - they essentially need to have 3D meshes/maps of all the roads they travel on, before Waymo can operate. Tesla, on the other hand, does not really need that, yet since it uses a pure CV approach.\n\nNone of this guaranteed Tesla's sucess, but almost none of the competitors are a real threat either, yet."

Im thinking about selling an insignificant amount of shares and buy puts to hedge. \\n\\nHere are some of my concerns:\\n\\nThey miss due to delivery miss and this lower guidance since the markets have been spooked due to the amount of exports and the China recession perhaps this could be priced in but theres no way of knowing. \\n\\nThey beat and announce a share buy back and they maintain their guidance however if its very good and the stock rises, i feet that the big man will use it as an opportunity to offload shares for his Twitter acquisition :/ huge overhang. \\n\\nPerhaps they beat on every aspect and we get a rally in the stock for whatever reason. But this given the conditions is unlikely. \\n\\nIm thinking about buying puts expiring on that Friday \\n\\nWhat does everyone think and please share your play. Remember'",

     "I don't think it will impact their sales much.\n\n1. They can only sell as many cars as they can produce. There is currently a limited supply of Teslas, so currently there is a very long waitlist. If more people want to buy Teslas, the wait list will get longer, but sales will stay the same because Tesla can only make a certain amount of cars.\n2. The only Model 3 that will qualify for the credit it the RWD Model 3 due to the price cap. But even that probably won't qualify because RWD Model 3s have LFP batteries made in China, so it won't meet the 40%/50% battery qualification.\n3. Model Y starts at 66k. That meets the 80k requirement, but that's still very expensive. Only very well-off people will be able to afford it, but there is a $150k income limit. Meaning the target market for Teslas will most likely not qualify for the credit.\n4. Fed tightening will almost certainly cause economic pain, meaning a cutback on household spending, including on expensive Teslas. People making under $150k a year and buying Teslas certainly won't anymore."

     "When the internet bubble happened, was it because internet was a fad or bad idea? No, it was a bubble regardless. Valuations were absurd, and most companies simply said \"internet\" without a clear idea how to monetize and add value - this resulted in no earnings.\n\nBubbles are visible when all other sectors are flat or negative, and one is standout. Everyone floods the one sector. All it takes is some bad news or one or two of the stocks in the only up sector to get a 'surprise' bad news, or for a few large firms to finally take profits that it pops. This is the scenerio we have now with 10 stocks being 30% of S&P and 60% of Nasdaq. It doesn't matter that they are 'good companies' that will exist for 30 years and ride out any rough times. When valuation \"doesn't matter\" and \"it will go up so i don't care\" with only one sector holding it up that you have RISK. What is your RISK in your portfolio? What needs to go down for you to set your retirement back 5 years? Are you exposed? Or are you just hoping to not be the bagholder?"

Are people really waiting for SP 3300-3500 to jump back in. It seems any dips we have from here will have so much buying pressure with all the cash waiting on the sidelines. At what point do people start fomoing when the market is dropping.\n\nCramer is even saying to keep some cash and wait for a drop from the debt ceiling. If everyone is doing the same thing is it really going to happen?\n\nIt seems like if this debt ceiling gets resolved and the FDIC came out and stopped short selling against banks or guaranteed deposits this market could take off. With so much money on the sidelines I could see a massive fomo rally."

     "Look, I've been long years in this business as a quant and professional asset manager. All i can say is that AI will not do much in stock market prediction. Most of the time, stock market (adjusted to long term growth) is moved by randomness. It could probably help average joe to cope with some behavioural biases and tell that based on statistics with, lets say 50 years data, at one time or another, it is better to hold more stocks in portfolio than usually.\n\nFor example, if msci world is down from peak more than 30%, change default 60/40 or 80/20 allocation to 80/20 or 90/10 etc. Pure and simple.\n\nIf it will generate signals based on some random technical analysis (which only works in the books) then its results also generate random outcomes. It's like predicting NBA game score based on some cloud formation two weeks ago. Sometimes it will tell the winner, sometimes even the score will be close. But it is just randomness.\n\nIf there were any robust, significant and sustainable advantage where AI could regularly predict next hour, next day or next week stock market outcome, it were already implemented somewhere. Look at hedge funds and banks. Those bastards regularly fail to predict if market will be up or down next year.\n\nWhy Google should burn money in some hardware like mobile phones production if their quantum computer can forsee the future? Just put cash in to stock market with leverage and bob is your uncle.\n\nProblem is, short term market is mostly random and long term history has not enough data points to train AI correctly.\n\nIt will generate brilliant pictures with pope in puffy jackets and detect cancer from medical scans no problem. For everyday investments it will be just a resume of info you can find in the internet."

This could imply that the Fed will maintain its accommodative monetary policy for longer, which could support the stock market.\u201d\n\n>\u201cTesla\u2019s delivery numbers exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations and showed strong demand for its electric vehicles. This could boost its revenue and profitability in the quarter and improve its competitive position in the industry. Tesla\u2019s stock price could rise on this positive news.\u201d\n\n>\u201cGameStop\u2019s stock sale plan indicates that it is trying to take advantage of its elevated share price and raise capital to fund its turnaround strategy. However, this could also dilute existing shareholders and put downward pressure on the stock price. GameStop\u2019s stock price could drop on this announcement.\u201d\n\nWow - thank God we have AI to decode those absolutely cryptic statements."

     "SHORT TSLA\n\nI have major problems with tesla.  I'm an investor, not a trader. So don't own TSLA and don't have shorted.  I buy and hold usually.  But I'd not buy any tesla now for an investment. \n\nWhy?\n\nWell the PE is crazy.  Not as bad as it once was, but still too high for me.  It seems that over the past two years that fundamentals haven't mattered.  The whole meme stock thing.  But they matter to me, and will eventually matter for TSLA.  Hype can only carry a company so far. \n\nI think they are a good company and have done amazing things with cars, but they aren't the magic company some think.  \n\nThe biggest problem I have though is the technology.  Electric cars aren't the future.  I don't see a major difference between a car burning gasoline and a car using electric made in a powerplant that is burning coal or oil or natural gas.  All electric cars use batteries.   Batteries have been around for 1000 years and they have always kinda sucked.  They get weaker and die eventually.  They are super toxic to make.  \n\nThe future is Hydrogen Fuel Cells.  An electric car that has a power plant inside it.  Only produces water out the tail pipe.  Hydrogen is the most common element.  The only hard part is getting the hydrogen. It likes to connect to other things.  But eventually they will figure it out.  (On a side note I think the Feds should start a Manhattan project like endeavor to figure out hydrogen. We need it bad.)   As long as the US uses powerplants that burn fossil fuels electric cars are just a bit better than gasoline cars. I doubt we will ever transition to 100% nuclear.  We can't find a place to store the nuclear waste that we have. Its a giant problem.  People don't really want them in their neighborhood.\n\nAnother problem is the capacity of our power grid.  Power companies have just enough power to supply our needs.  Ever hear of a rolling blackout during the summer?  Too many people running AC use too much power and the system is short.  If just 10% of people switched to driving electric cars I think the power grid would fail. \n\nIf Tesla would start investing heavily into hydrogen fuel cells I would probably change my tune though."

The shareholders are suing Tesla over money they lost after Musk tweeted in 2018 that he was considering taking his electric vehicle company private at $420 per share and said he had funding secured to do so. Teslas stock trading initially halted, then shares were highly volatile for weeks after the tweets. Musk later said that he had been in discussions with Saudi Arabias sovereign wealth fund and felt confident that funding would come through at his proposed price. A deal never materialized. The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated and charged Musk with civil securities fraud as a result of those tweets. Tesla and Musk struck a revised settlement agreement in 2019 over those charg'",

IF he lied about the Saudi wealth fund and committed fraud by stating he wanted to go private--then he benefited greatly from making those public statements--benefitted financially.  Hence, the lawsuit would be correct. The judgment is against him, but knowing the reality of the world, there may be shades of gray.  Musk  undoubtably intended to take Tesla private at the time, BUT as a CEO, he is not you and I making posts on reddit.  He is a man with lawyers, financial advisors, executives, and staff at his command:  he knows the law and has those to advise him on it.  He took a gamble to generate buzz to inflate his stock, but others lost money because of his deception.  There it is in nutshell:  his deception.   He may be financially liable if that is the case."

But within the next couple of years we will see a host of electric options from other manufacturers including luxury cars like Mercedes and BMW. The market share might be maintained but at least in the US, in order to compete they are going to have to be more competitive with pricing. I like Tesla as a company but I don't see them taking the next step to 2 trillion market cap without increasing their solar production. Personally, I am not buying a Tesla car because the new interior aesthetic is off for me, no matter how many cool features it has. I'm waiting for a Mercedes or BMW options, both of which I have in ICE versions and the interiors are exceptional."

The \"cheap\" EV will unlock an enormous wave of demand (not that that's currently a problem for Tesla anyways). This is a HUGE reason why Tesla will continue to keep growing at a 50%+ rate for the foreseeable future. Obviously there are tons of other factors why they will keep growing like crazy (FSD, energy..) but I believe the 25k EV is a huge driver and why the stock will continue to grow over time. Just my opinion, relax bears."

I have some pros and cons for some of the big names, but if you guys know of any chip stocks that stand out, leave a comment on the post because Im curious of what you guys have to say about the whole industry. \\n\\nTSMC - high market cap, very successful company but high geopolitical tensions\\n\\nNVDA - one of the best tech stocks out there but have have been consistently growing for 6 months (could be good or bad)\\n\\nINTC - American company with factories all over the world with a great history, but has fallen behind competitors over the last few years. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think?'",

     "I sell semiconductors for a living.    Mostly into automotive.  The companies you mention are mostly for consumer electronics.  This market is slowing.  Automotive is continuing to thrive.  I am still having record sales monthly.  I see automotive semiconductors an attractive place to be in the future especially with EVs coming more online, they have more chip content then ICE vehicles.  Just my opinion.   The companies that I own are MCHP, NXPI, MPWR and ADI also ON is starting to look attractive, AVGO has a nice dividend. TSMC does build some of the products above but a lot of them have their own fabs which is a real advantage in bringing new chips to market.   I may be bias but this is what I see."

Had no knowledge of investing, trading, crypto, BTC, nothing - thought if you buy something that has increased a lot in price historically, just hold it until it's increased more before you sell, you're golden. I was deeply wrong and learned the hard way. I was also really into the idea of saving on taxes by holding for at least a year before selling anything. This led to my first mistake of not getting out of that horrible investment the 1 single time BSV experienced a peak high enough for me to have broken even.  Second mistake, became discouraged by BSV's pretty contstant trajectory downward from there (plus learning more and more about the total scam and lie that was BSV) and missed plenty of opportunities to average down and get out. After a couple of years, RH (my broker for that trade) delisted BSV and due to restrictions in my state, I had no option to transfer coins out off the platform so was forced to sell at a massive loss of about 90%. \nLearnings: a ton, but top learnings - DO THE RESEARCH. DD is non-negotioable. Read the charts for entries, don't just jump in. Understand the context before taking risk. Understand the risk itself - examine every possible scenario regarding the fundamentals of the asset & the contract you are entering with the trade. Understand the very real risks of delisting and what your backup plan will be. Understand the full scope of entry/exit plans before you put your capital on the line. Learned a lot from this deeply expensive lesson, and it hurt bad. Still does.\n\nBest: Have been keeping my sizable savings in t-bills and t-bill ETFs to take advantage of current high rates on short termers. Doesn't yield a whole lot but it's like a tax-advantaged savings account for me until I feel ready to jump into riskier assets. Feel great about this decision as it was extremely well-informed and I understand exactly what I'm doing with it. From worst to best, I see myself on a great trajectory towards future success."

I 100% don't condone any type of behavior like that, but let's see what evidence comes out.\n\n...but if I was wearing my conspiracy theory hat for fun (which I dont normally do), the timing seems a little bizarre given that:\n\n1) This administration has been very obviously against Tesla/Elon the way it shunned Tesla publicly and tried to promote Mary Barra and GM as the leader in the EV space....clearly not even remotely true and kind of embarrassing to watch our president refuse for weeks to even mention Tesla by name.\n\n2) Anti-Tesla, Missy Cummings, was appointed to a key advisory role at the NHTS and is against tesla's autopilot technology.  This is a big area of future growth for Tesla.\n\n3) Elon decides wants to buy Twitter and open it up and said Trump should be allowed on the platform.  He also said he switched form Democrat to Republican.\n\n4) Elon's acquisition of Twitter relies on the value Tesla shares for his ability to raise enough capital ( I believe...correct me if I am wrong)\n\n5) S&P ESG dropped Tesla citing one of the reasons as \u201clack of a low-carbon strategy\u201d which is essentially what the entirety of Tesla is about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis might sound crazy, but it seems like this administration has been very anti-Tesla and probably was freaking out about Twitter allowing Trump back on the platform and being controlled by Musk, so given the acquisition was linked to Musk's Tesla share value, if Tesla stock tanks, then Musk can't buy Twitter and it keeps remaining censored.\n\nBefore my inbox blows up with unsolicited hatred.  I will say I own a Tesla and I love their vehicles and I and a few shares that I am holding, but nothing substantial.  I think Musk is a bit of a loose canon and is both an asset and a risk for Tesla even though he's a product visionary, I sometimes wish he would lay off twitter as often times it hurts more than it helps."

With that shine rubbing off recently (thanks to Elon's more and more outlandish shenanigans), it is hard to see how his image could continue to float the skyhigh valuation."

Berlin and Texas did about 12k in total. 133k from Fremont and the rest from Shanghai.\n\nBiggest reason numbers were still so strong is that Shanghai is up to a runrate of over 1M now, 1.2M after July's upgrades, and did 71k in June despite not being at full production yet.\n\nShanghai will have some downtime again in Q3, but will be at a runrate and reach production in Q4 equal to their total production in Q1, which is just nuts. On top of that Berlin and Texas will start meaningful production in Q3. H2 is going to be nuts for Tesla."

Understood Tesla isn\u2019t where Boston Dynamics is today but Tesla has money and the insane ambition of Musk behind it so I can only imagine the gap will be bridged no later than four to five years. Imagine having your own private slave robot at home doing all kinds of work for you (and at your business) that you show it once or twice to train and it does it on its own. Waiters in restaurants - gone. Hand washing cars - all humans gone. Dishwasher, picking vegetables, what would cost 40k to 60k per annum would be replaced by a 40k robot (Musk is notorious to understate prices so 40k is a conservative estimate). And even more beautiful thing is, bill of the cost of the robot will be software so scaling is easy and contribution from marginal sales is high."

Luxury car companies known for their solid operating margins and gross profits are solid steps below Tesla now. The brand with the second highest operating margin, BMW, is a few percentage points below Teslas +15% operating margin. Third-placed Daimler, at 10%, isnt even close!\\n\\nGet down to Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen, and its a different world.\\n\\nRelated to money is energy use, and one more thing Elon Musk pointed out in the shareholder meeting was that energy use per vehicle produced has come down  cutting emissions while saving money. From Teslas factory in California to its factory in Shanghai, the company has achieved a 17% reduction in energy use per vehicle.'",

     ">Tesla shareholder meeting held earlier today was a graph showing that Tesla has risen to #1 in the auto industry in terms of operating margin\n\n1. Tesla's cheapest model is at $46k now. Every other car company has much cheaper models. Those naturally compress margins.\n2. Tesla's is cutting back R&D by a huge amount. Look at the % of R&D to revenues compared to other car companies.\n3. Tesla only has 4 models. Other car companies have much more, to serve a bigger variety of customers and they also do yearly refreshes on those models, something Tesla does not do.\n4. Tesla Days of Payables is much higher than the rest of the industry. That means that they pay their suppliers much later -  thus increasing margins. \n\nThat a company has much better operating margins than their competitors is usually a sign of worry. As competition is coming (and it is already there -  look at Tesla's sale numbers in Europe they hugely decline not just in market share, but also in total), those margins will compress. Additionally since Tesla has a higher market cap than most of their competitors combined, they need high margins and growth to justify it.\n\nI don't think they will be able to do it. Contrary to Software, new factories don't scale (to get from (500k-1m you need one new factory, to get from 1m-2 you need two etc), Tesla will not be able to deliver that growth and margins over the next decade.\n\nI actually think that Tesla will be similar to Cisco of the 2000. And I am making a guess: Tesla will not see 1222$ for the next two decades."

They might have been closed for longer but that's about all I could find, but going off their December run rate that means they should have produced probably about 14-15k more. So 320k should be close to the \"true\" production in Q1."

A lot of early adopters bought the Tesla because it was the only show in town. When there is massive competition  they will have a hard time keeping up. The main reason i believe is their price points. 45k for a super simple car, almost 70k for same car with upgrades. That brings major players into the game at that space. The BMW is a way nicer car than anything Tesla makes and can be had for 75 pretty loaded.  Porsche Taycan bottom of the line can be had for 90ish and is way nicer than a Model S. They will have to lower their prices to keep up IMO."

If demand ever drops they can either lower prices or move in to other vehicle markets. This is the reason why Cybertruck production has been delayed. Because demand is so high for Model Y it does not make sense to move production away yet. \n\n\\- The more the competition moves towards EVs then the bigger the overall pie will get. Demand for infrastructure, batteries and charging will also increase which in turn will increase demand for tesla products."

I update those targets after every earnings call and update my model with the new realized growth.\n\nIn \\~2030 I'm expecting we'll be looking at a 25-30 PE which even with almost unreasonably conservative growth rates (average 8% annually post 2022) will put us at a 1500 price which represents an annualized rate of return of 15% which is double the long term average of the stock market and a completely respectable rate of return.\n\nIf Tesla can continue to grow at their current 2022 projected growth of 44% annualized rate then we'll be looking at 7500-8000 share price though I don't want to bet on that so I cut their growth down to the long term average of 8% for the stock market as a whole and even with that I like the current stock's purchase price."

When it comes to AI tech and large language models, it\u2019s the real deal and the development cycles are now measured in days and months. \n\nAlso, this isn\u2019t blockchain or the metaverse \u2014 AI is already powerful enough today, that as of 2 days ago, some scientists and people like Elon Musk are petitioning to slow down the pace of its development (I don\u2019t agree we should, but shows how smart minds are taking AI very seriously). So, yes there will be an AI stock bubble at some point (probably later this year and next), but imo we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. That said, because it\u2019s so early, one caveat is it\u2019s not yet clear where the value capture for AI will be \u2014 aside from companies with established competitive advantages (MSFT/OpenAI, NVDA) and maybe some semis (TSMC, ASML, AMD etc), it\u2019s a bit premature to pile into AI growth stocks (eg, C3.ai)"

All they have to do is provide a service equal to or greater than any human and they'll replace 3/4 of every call center team. I suspect most organizations will require a few humans to learn from but the vast majority of calls will be replaced. In Canada, what would be a 50k role MSFT might collect 10k. This is assuming MSFT is the company that drives that optimization. It's also possible that a Startup provides that service. In which case they pay open AI for the access and MSFT gets there cut from the server utilization. I can't seem to find any information on whether Microsoft is an investor of OpenAI but I hope they are. That way investing in Microsoft at least means exposure to OpenAI which is currently private.\n\nI also think OpenAI's chatGPT is going to become the invisible 5th member of any team.

Availability is slated to begin in the spring in Europe and later this year in North America and Australia.\\n\\n>Todays partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company.

Maybe $6k-$8k cheaper than what they're going for new.\n\nHell, Tesla just raised prices $3k last month in the US on most of their model 3s / Ys.  They also just raised the model 3 SR+ price by $10k (usd) in Germany last weekend.

Tesla is trying to break new limits and innovate while VW has many car brands under its group and steady sale numbers, profits, and good margins, but Tesla has a sense of wonder because no one can really put an accurate evaluation on their technology that hasn\u2019t been successfully applied to the market. Hell it could all be bullshit, but market sentiment is, that its building the foundation to being the leader in the growing EV space so people rather pay more money for potential growth than realized value. Value is great but is it real value and does it matter when no one else sees the value?"

     "But aren't stocks about investing in the ***future*** of the company? And not by their current stats but by their trending stats. VW has basically stayed in about the same ballpark of revenue for the past 5+ years, going up and down. While Tesla has drastically been increasing their revenue year over year since 2018. VW either increases or decreases their revenue by no more than about 10% year over year. Tesla just got their first full year of profit in 2020. But that's not what you should be focusing on. This is what you should be focusing on:\n\nTesla\n\n2018: Increased profit by 50%.\n\n2019: Increased profit by 10%\n\n2020: Increased profit by 179% \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow compare that to VW:\n\n2018: Increased profit by 7%\n\n2019: Increased profit by 1.5%\n\n2020: Decreased profit by 10%, making them lower than what they made back in 2017.\n\nNow which trend line looks better to you? There just doesn't seem to be any growth at VW in recent years, while Tesla is showing nothing but growth, especially in 2020. Not to mention the other companies intertwined with it, like SpaceX. While that's not necessarily reflective of Tesla's performance, it will impact their price because the both of them being under the same umbrella increases stability and assurance when either do well.\n\nNow, do I think Tesla is worth what it is currently worth? No. But I do think it is more valuable than VW simply because I see it lasting longer than VW, and even one day surpassing them. There are many reasons to value a stock what you value it at. You might go purely off of profit for that year. While others will value a company based on their trends. And others will invest based on meme culture. Which some might disagree with, but what is objectively true about meme culture is it keeps that name in your mind. It's free advertisement, and advertisements usually equal increased sales."

     "Have you seen a Tesla vs their Id4? One looks sleek and minimalistic the other looks like a kids' toy car with a bunch of whacky features. Until VW designs an EV that looks, performs, and price matches Tesla they aren't a threat. Same can be said about many other EVS; either they look nice and can't match the performance or they can match but are not priced for the larger market (Porsche, Mercedes) or have some sort of limitation (range or otherwise) that makes Teslas the better choice.\n\nYou also forget Tesla literally has built a supercharging network in Europe and North America where you can literally drive to any major destination and charge like getting gas.\n\nI think some of you think removing the engine and putting in a battery makes any vehicle an EV and they'll sell just as well as an ICE. Early adopters want something they can feel good about that has an intangible personality associated with the brand. Tesla and Rivian. That's part of the cult following. Moreover, Rivian poached a bunch of ex-Tesla employees, is trying to brand differentiate from Tesla--Tesla is sleek and futuristic, Rivian is outdoorsy and eco/adventurish and is making their first vehicles fill the niches Tesla currently lacks: full SUV and truck.\n\nLegacy car makers are going to have a lot of difficulties reinventing their appeal to fit that mold. If they could have done it Tesla would not be in their current position. They've been the best-selling vehicle in multiple markets in the last two years, hands down, even when compared to ICE sales. Teslas are eating into the Germany 3s luxury segment as it's seen as an upscale vehicle due to their pricing. \n\nDo I think the stock is overvalued? Yes.\n\nDo I think they could possibly become the dominant global EV carmaker in the next 10-20 years? Yes.\n\nThey'll have 4 gigafactories up by next year (Shanghai, CA, TX, Berlin) and Lucid JUST started to ramp up at their first factory. The innovation on their cars (whether you like it or not) has been setting the standard other manufacturers are trying to copy and meet. Tesla has had ten years of iteration going on for their cars and many other companies haven't even completed 2 model years successively, even those mostly based on previous models they've retrofitted. Audi is basing their etrons frames off ICE models and won't have a novel EV redesign until 2025. \n\nAdditionally, their production line means there are constant improvements throughout the year. There is no \"year model\" because they are constantly tweaking the manufacturing process. A car is 2021 when it was produced in 2021 and there very well could be huge changes vs an end of year product.\n\nA teardown video between various Model 3s from the last few years showed at least five iterations on some parts in the hood. Legacy manufacturers simply cannot do that currently. They also reduced the welding from 150+ frame parts by simply casting the entire frame in a mold.\n\nI don't think many people understand the intricacies of what the company is doing. They see Elon and think he's an eccentric billionaire playing with his toy car company."

Same with reinvestment etc.\n\nI may caution you QQQ is not meant for everyone. My Nov 2021 I added it for comparison and I regret to admit timing was all wrong. Still baghold that index."

Hes made more than $14 billion in those sales. But over that time hes also exercised options to buy about 16.4 million stock options at about $6.24 a share, actually increasing his stake in the electric-auto maker.\\n\\nMusk also tweeted Sunday nigh'",

     "The comments on this \u201cstock\u201d sub are the apotheosis of stupidity. First, Elon isn\u2019t saying California sucks and always did. He\u2019s simply saying that achieving the level of success he achieved is becoming more and more difficult due to policy changes. Which explains why he and his company are leaving. California has plenty to offer, to many folks, but he is now a target\u2014and he\u2019s not wrong. It\u2019s becoming harder and harder to succeed in this country in general because of policy changes in Washington that crush main Street. Second, wealthy folks don\u2019t mind paying taxes. The problem is, the money is wasted. The government doesn\u2019t have an income problem, it has a spending problem. So when I lose half my paycheck or earnings to taxes, yea, it kinda pisses me off. My family came here with nothing and I was taught that taxes are the entry fee we pay to be Americans. I\u2019m okay with that. But When I see how the government now spends my money, it boils my blood. So, without going into too much detail, I\u2019ll say that the narrative among many in the upper tax bracket is not a general opposition to taxes, but rather how that money is spent foolishly and it is therefor frustrating to see hard earned dollars pissed away. Elon\u2019s billions will be gone in 8 months. In 8 months uncle Sam will have spent every penny and there will be nothing to show for it. Third, I don\u2019t care how much money you start with, achieving Elon\u2019s level of success is near impossible. I\u2019m sorry to say this, but anyone that bashes his success or where he started, is extremely ignorant, clearly bitter, very likely unsuccessful and will remain so, and possess both a low IQ and EQ. Elon has single handed my advanced mankind though Tesla, Neuralink, SpaceX, starlink, the boring company, he is currently working quietly on carbon capture . . . The man is brilliant and driven beyond comprehension. I don\u2019t care how many great people you claim he hires, I don\u2019t care how much money you think he started with, no one accomplished what he has by sitting back and watching. His level of success and innovation is absofuckinglutely insane. To say otherwise (and I rarely use this word) is the very definition of stupid. Fourth, this is a stock sub. While you have a right to espouse your beliefs and ideas wherever you damn well please, perhaps you ought to consider talking about your socialist ideology elsewhere. Or whatever communist, socialist, illogical fantasies you possess. This isn\u2019t the sub for it. Fifth, when did we villainize success? Growing up, I was told to admire, learn from, watch wealthy successful people. And I did. And it helped me achieve my success early in life. I looked to those people for inspiration, guidance, advice and help. I never villainized them. I respected them and their hustle and what it took for them to get to that point in their lives. Now we make these folks out to be monsters. Truth is, they are just normal people who are willing to work a bit harder, with a bit more focus on specific goals, they are excellent at execution (where most fail) . . . They got to where they are by being smart and working hard. Perhaps, instead of villainizing them, we should aspire to achieve that level of success ourselves. And then, guess what, you can use your platform to espouse whatever crazy ideas you have. You can give all your money to charity. You can do anything you want."

     "EV's are getting hit across the board. Unless Tesla had insane margins for Q4, most investors knew what to expect already once Tesla reported their Q4 deliveries.\n\nI just want to highlight the value investors who still can't get over Tesla's P/E ratio which at this time, is hovering around 190. Note: No other EV maker is even profitable right now selling purely EV's so while people are bickering about Tesla's high P/E ratio, do realize other EV makers are LOSING money selling EV's.\n\nTesla just reported $5.5 billion in net income for the year 2021.\n\nFor reference, GM reported, last year, net income of $6.43 billion.\n\nKeep in mind, this is despite the fact that GM does 3x the revenue of Tesla.\n\nAll this should tell you is that Tesla's margins are INSANE for the auto industry. Combine this with the fact that GM and other car manufacturers are losing money selling EV's, expect their net income to drop while Tesla's net income climbs exponentionally. Just two years ago, Tesla was bleeding billions of dollars. By the end of this year, their net income is likely to reach $7-8 billion. That's bonkers for a company that just 5 years ago, was on the verge of bankruptcy. That, my friends, is why Tesla's stock climbed to astronomical numbers during this stretch.\n\nI don't really care for the afterhours activity or even short-term market reaction to this earnings. I am more interested in Elon's earnings call appearance today. It will be interesting to see the guidance heading forward.\n\nAnd if you're still one of those people shouting that Tesla is overvalued, just realize that the noise is getting quieter and quieter every year that passes. And that's for a reason."

     ">Anyone here actually holding Tesla long term even with all the bad news\n\nYes. The decision is pretty easy.\n\n\\- Tesla has loads of pricing power due to very high profit margins\n\n\\- They go from record to record each quarter\n\n\\-  They're (virtually) debt free (unlike all competitors which are mostly 100bn+ in debt).\n\n\\- Vertical integration. The amount of flexibility and first mover potential/advantage that comes with this seems to fly under the radar of most.\n\n\\-  They have the pick of the best and brightest when it comes to hiring (this is probably the major reason why Tesla is going to be successful in the long term. Product 'now' is one thing. But long term it's about people.)\n\n\\- They have other parts of the company set to bloom (energy being the prime candidate that is set to take off now that the battery supply block seems to be getting resolved. But stuff like the semi with FSD could be a game changer in the trucking business - even if it's relegated to highways, only. I'm not even counting the possibilities of robotaxi or Tesla bot)\n\n\\- They have THE global charging network. Opening that up is an instant cash cow of significant size\n\n\\- strictly from the stocks side:  Large institutional investors haven't even started adding Tesla to their portfolios due to it only being ranked \"investment grade\" a short time ago.\n\n.... and, most of all: Tesla has a customer base that is happy with the product to a degree that any other manufacturer could only dream of.\n\n(I probably could come up with some more reasons but that's just the ones that spring to mind. Personally I also count Elon as a big plus since he's got a very clear vision on what needs to be done, but I can see where others would disagree on this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh..and what 'bad news' are you talking about that would have any long term impact?"

Intel too has recently started competing.\n\nPoint is: what really matters to customers of those GPUs eventually is how much computing power they get for their money. There's different models and different software out there.\n\nAnybody expecting Nvidia to dominate without a competition for a decade clearly does not understand the complexity of long term dominance in tech which is very hard to obtain and maintain."

The companys spectacular sales growth could be the problem, he wrote.\\n\\nBack in 2013, Trainer was worried about Tesla s low profitability, reliance on sales of zero-emission regulatory credits, and persistent cash burn. Tesla reported a small operating loss in 2013, but things have improved substantially.\\n\\nThe company is expected to report about $15 billion in operating profit for 2022. Whats more, Tesla has now generated positive free cash flow over its entire life and Wall Street projects another $6.5 billion during the second half of 2022. The total expected between 2023 and 2025 is roughly $55 billion.\\n\\nCheap growth capital and falling interest rates hel'",

These cases are extremely complex and the damages unfold over decades even as the terrifying anxiety of affected people living along the Ohio River watershed are very real, tangible and immediate. Property damage is also very real and immediate as anybody trying to sell a home or farm in the area can attest. \n\nMeanwhile the Norfolk Southern remains a very profitable company, which is a good thing since a share of such profits will be needed to compensate victims for the railroad\u2019s negligence, assuming it can be adequately proved in a court of law. \n\nThe American legal system is not perfect and the wheels of justice turn very slowly. Ultimately no amount of money is adequate compensation for the injury and loss of life, livelihood and serenity once one can no longer drink or bathe or breathe or plant seeds or raise animals, pets, or children without reasonable fear and worry. Corporations hire the very best attorneys to protect their interests which are considerable in a capitalist system. \n\nDon\u2019t expect the stock market to reflect your outrage for an organization, system or company that while professing safety engages in unfathomable risktaking that jeopardizes lives and livelihoods far removed from corporate HQ or shareholders. \nIf you expect the stock to lose a substantial portion of its value over the next few weeks or months then you must actually demonstrate how the \u201caccident\u201d is likely to impact the company\u2019s earnings over the next 2-5 years. Aside from somewhat greater legal expenses and meager attempt to mollify/compensate a few of the most obvious victims in the immediate vicinity of the accident, I don\u2019t see anything to cause the earnings prospects of the company to greatly suffer.

Let's also say hypothetically it buys up all the infrastructure too for another $400 million.  \n\nThe rail is self-insured up to $75 million in 3rd party damages and is covered to up to $800 million by insurance specifically for incidents like these per their 10-K. This means even at that absolute worst case the rail only needs to pay a $75 million charge, which is somewhat marginal compared to its market value of $55 billion."

I don\u2019t think people understand the scale of the company compared to the costs it\u2019ll see from clean up efforts. A portion of costs will likely be covered by insurance which other other people have outlined. For some perspective the Lac-Megantic rail disaster back in 2013 was one of the worse rail disasters in recent history with 48 deaths. The settlement for victims was $338M and I have seen clean up cost estimates around $200 to $400M. No one died in the NSC derailment but there will likely be many long term affects so maybe it\u2019s comparable. So I think the opinion that NSC\u2019s stock hasn\u2019t reacted appropriately isn\u2019t really true.\n\nIn my opinion the real threat to the company comes from increased regulatory scrutiny around PSR as that has been driving higher profitability at the rails. If the companies have to walk back some of the changes made and increase head counts that could be significantly more costly in the long run than this disaster."

Got a factory in Tennessee that is starting cell production this year to fulfill a $330m order for a 1.2GWh BESS order. Also will qualify for the IRA stipend of $45k/kWh since we do both cells (35k) + packs (10k). We expect over $1.5-2 Billion long term from the IRA just with the one USA factory. Oh and the DOE gave us a $200m grant to build a separator factory in partnership with G fucking M (General Motors). To help them fulfill their performance and safety goals, especially in their Ultium line of cells (think premium). We also are the sole cell supplier for Iveco\u2019s new eDaily van\u2026 an electric version of Iveco\u2019s normal (gas powered) eDaily\u2026 the most popular ($$$) commercial van in all of Europe.

My speculation is that this Hertz order will be huge for Tesla beyond the revenue from the order itself in that it can introduce tens of thousands of customers a week to Tesla cars, which may help drive sales. Furthermore, 100,000 extra EVs on the road driven mostly by tourists renting cars may encourage more destination chargers, more charging infrastructure, etc. in areas where these cars are being rented."

     "The fact that Hertz CEO, Mark Fields (former Ford CEO), chose to pay full price and willing to wait 14 months for Tesla speak volumes. \n\nHertz could easily split the order to like 50k Tesla, 25K Mach E and 25k ID4. They could get huge discounts but chose not to buy from Ford, VW or GM. Hertz did their deligience that not only Tesla is a huge draw, but the total cost of ownership is lower than all the legacy EV. \n\nBut at the same time, if any customer renting a Mach E is stuck in the middle of nowhere because Electrify America chargers broke down, they would not rent from Hertz again. Tesla's supercharger network is a huge moat and any other rental companies buying non-Tesla EV will have to face. \n\nWhile Tesla is supply constrained for years to come, putting many more drivers who get to drive Tesla for the first time will just light the fire on more demands for Model 3, Y and Cybertruck. Very few people who drive a Model 3 will think about buying Camry as their next car. \n\nTLDR. Competition is not coming, unless you think you know more about car business than Mark Fields."

     "My uncle is an avid Tesla hater. Seeing him every time he visits and Tesla continue to still be dominant is a subject he avoids particularly since I've made a killing on it and find every reason to bust his balls about it.\n\nThe fact is, Tesla isn't going away. You're going to say the evaluation is too overvalued. Fine. That doesn't change the fact that if you think Tesla is staying at a $900 billion market cap for the next five years, you're not understanding the trajectory of how markets work. People have a FOMO which will only drive Tesla higher. No one wants to sell and many want to buy. The few doubters are those who still think GM/Ford/VW have a chance. Do they? Sure. But they are wayyyy behind in just about everything outside of manufacturing expertise. When those idiots say they plan to go fully EV in the next decade while Tesla's fully EV fleet continues to grow with more factories expected to open by EOTY, you're in trouble.\n\nNote: 100k Tesla's is going to be 15% of all Tesla's deliveries this year. This is no small amount.\n\nThe next step is to get Tesla's tax credits out and to install more EV charging across the states. Malls are dead but I do believe they can be revived if people looked at malls as all-in-one shopping centers while they charge their EV. And the people complaining about the EV charging could easily install an EV charger if they own their home. EV charging is largely going to only be an in-demand need for those who live in apartment units without access to an EV charger in their home or long-distance travelers. The average person who owns an EV shouldn't have an issue charging their vehicle if they can install an EV charger. With the rising costs in gas, I expect more people to consider switching to EV's for next year than many other years. When you see gas trickle up near $4-5 gallon, it's time to consider an EV."

The latter part may be true (but even then the valuation on the other sectors of their business still don't justify the price per growth).  It really doesn't though.  Just think, if TSLA somehow gobbled up the entirety of GM, F, and HMC market share (which 100% won't happen) they would see their annual revenues increase from the current $46B to an astounding $449B (that's almost 10X their current market share).  Sure lets somehow say that happened, using their current profit figures of $3.5B gross income generated from $46B in sales (7.6%), that means they would generate roughly $34B in profit annually (that's more than GM, F, and HMC combined currently).  Even with those astounding numbers it would take TSLA 30 years to earn that valuation in profits.  \n\nALL of that assumes TSLA puts GM, F, and HMC completely out of business and takes all of their market share.  Once again that won't happen.  Their software sales are not going to generate that kind of income.  Their former  president recently said TSLA is priced to perfection (that was made previously) and after todays run it's gone into pure speculation and FOMO.  I hate to be a bear because I think TSLA is a great company with a promising future, but the valuation is completely out of whack at this point.  There will be a rug pull at some point and I'd be willing to bet it happens in 2022 as rate hikes and inflation becomes a bigger talking point.  I'll be trimming almost my entire position at this price.  Can't complain about the returns this far but I want to see this come back to reality before getting back in.  Just my opinion."

     "The divide on Tesla's valuation is because people tend to fall in one of two camps:\n\n1. Bulls who think that Tesla will maintain strong growth and margins\n\n2. Bears who think Tesla's growth rates will slow and margins will start coming back towards industry norms\n\nOP here is clearly one of the bulls who think they can maintain good growth and margins.  Personally, I think they do have a number of potential headwinds in maintaining those.\n\nThe good news is that their success in 2021 and share price drop means they are nowhere near as overvalued as they were before.  They are also likely to be able to grow nicely for the next couple of years.  But as time goes on they are going to see a lot of issues with competition growing and margins shrinking.  It's really, really hard to both grow sales quickly while also maintaining high margins in the auto industry."

I wouldn't personally buy it because it doesn't seem attractively valued to me, but it's also not unjustifiable if you really believe in what they're doing.\n\nWhat I would add though is that most people betting on TSLA in 2020/2021 were just wrong. TSLA wasn't a technology story, but a margins story. There margin's are extremely good for a automaker and when combined with their growth a high multiple is understandable. How much more growth they have left and whether they can continue to expand margins is what concerns me. My guess is that everything that has allowed TSLA to demand such a high relative valuation today is going to be against them in a few years. Growth will slow, margin expansion will stall or decline, their technology advantage will narrow, etc. It's going to be difficult to keep justifying that multiple with those headwinds, although if they can continue to grow at a decent pace it's quite possible they'll mostly grow into their current valuation. Still, this isn't a good risk/reward profile for an investment so either way I won't be investing, but yeah, it's not unjustifiable anymore, but still probably 3-4 times above where most would consider fair value is."

Where and how are you getting all that raw material and all those people to make the product?   You can\u2019t ship 2,000 cars in a shipping container like you can with a phone.

     "Alright, I have written it previously, so here is the bull case for Tesla. That requires them to sell 10m cars by 2030 (keep in mind, with current lithium mining operations there can only be 6.5m EVs yearly if they monopolize all lithium). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssume that Tesla overtakes VW and Toyota to become the best selling car brand in 2030. Selling 10m at an average price of $50 000 (more than the averag of VW at around 32k and Toyota at 27k) and an operating margin double that of Toyota (who is the most efficient car brand as of today) at 20% would mean $500b in revenue and $100 in EBIT. Let's say that Tesla trades at 2x the P/S valuation of Toyota, it would imply a valuation of $1000 at 10x earnings - appropriate as they would have stopped growing (there is a demand limit how many cars you can sell)  \nEven if Tesla becomes the best-selling car company in 2030 with higher margings, they are fairly priced as of today. Their price expects perfect execution. If you come with solar, batteries, software, FSD, robotaxies, insurance of other arguments - there is no evidence that Tesla will create a dominate market position in them. Tesla failed to deliver the FSD that was promised for years.  \nAs there is no margin of safety with even the utmost perfect projections, margins and valuation."

You need to also account for other risks - like competitors, supply chain issues, optimistic management projections, etc etc etc."

     "You basically assume here that Tesla will continue torrid growth, while maintaining current margins. That is the part Tesla bears dispute. Tesla bears, myself included say that growth will slow and margins will compress due to competition and market saturation. Look to Netflix as an example of what we\u2019re talking about. Netflix has reached saturation is its major markets and serious competition has arrived. As a result is is being re-rated from a company that is valued largely on potential, to a company that is valued mainly on earnings. And the stock is now back where it was almost four years ago. \n\nMany of just just simply don\u2019t believe that Tesla is going to capture huge market share, and maintain their margins. Auto making is very capital intensive. It doesn\u2019t take a ton of margin compression for earnings to take as serious hit.\n\nA Tesla bull\u2019s position is basically that Tesla is unstoppable and nobody will be able to compete with the company."

They said 50% growth in '22 overall (so including Austin and Berlin ramping up)\n\n\\- Because Austin and Berlin will start producing and delivering cars, they will now need to amortize the cost of the factories against the vehicles made from there. This should lower their margins until they can fully ramp, which takes at least a year (eg into 2023)"

     "Any company\u2019s valuation can be \u201cjustified\u201d with the right combination of growth assumptions. \n\nThe key here is how plausible the growth assumptions are. Nobody can know the future for certain, so pricing in growth assumptions to a stock is, by definition, speculative. It is a speculative bet at its core. Anything that hasn\u2019t yet happened is speculative. \n\nP/E ratios rise when investors expect more earnings in the future\u2014and are willing to pay for them now. \n\nValue investors generally don\u2019t like to pay way far in advance of those earnings actually existing, while speculative investors are more willing to pay in advance. \n\nSo, to buy Tesla at these prices is simply a function of how much you *expect* Tesla to grow its earnings, which may or may not happen at the price investors are paying *right now*.\n\nAny time investors are paying a higher P/E, they\u2019re saying that they\u2019re willing to accept less future return for the potential benefit of locking in their price now.\n\nAs companies mature and slow growth, history has shown on average P/Es decrease over time. This means that investors are pricing in less future earnings growth (*NOT* revenue growth).\n\nI believe it would be reasonable to argue that paying such a high multiple is making a very high conviction bet on whatever growth assumptions you\u2019re using\u2014and paying for growth that is far into the future. \n\nThe further into the future one is trying to predict, the less accurate the predictions are. My prediction that the weather will be clear tomorrow\u2014or that I will go to work as scheduled\u2014is much more likely to be accurate than if I was predicting the same for a day 2 years from now. \n\nIn summary, I think the fundamental argument to *not* pay a 100-300 P/E can be justified by the simple fact that things became far less certain the further into the future they are. \n\nMusk himself said he thinks we\u2019ll see a recession soon, which by itself will cause a re-calculation of expected sales/growth and make all the previous assumptions less valid as new information comes to light. This will cause a repricing by itself. \n\nAs such, I believe it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to say that, at a 100-300 P/E, growth that far into the future is fundamentally less certain and it wouldn\u2019t be a good use of capital to pay for all of that growth *now*.\n\nWhat if Musk dies in a year? Or something else materially happens with the company? That would change the company and investor assumptions. With little margin of safety for so much pricing of future growth, Tesla stock could tank hard suddenly, since it wouldn\u2019t have the current earnings to support it. This is basically what happened to Netflix and DocuSign.\n\nSo paying this much is assuming an immense amount of risk, and investors have to take that into consideration. Risk appetite recedes in a rising rate and/or recession environment, which lowers multiples investors are willing to pay. That\u2019s why its come down so much."

So Musk has projected a rather poor 2022 and by the end of this year he will have twice as much competitition to deal with in the SV market, even as he seems to have lost interest in SV's, not even mentioning any new models, because he has no plans for any.\n\nINstead he has a prototype robot that doesn't work that he wants you to et enthused about. Plus a landing on Mars and what else, Dogecoin?  THose are all unsound investments to say the least.   So I see him as kind of like Howard Hughes at the same age, wildly over-rich, self centered, immature, quirky and impetuous and so selfish he will just do whatever the hell he wants whenever he wants and doesn't care how crazy he seems.\n\nTSLA is the most overvalued stock in the market, priced bout 300% above Toyota and any kind of fair value.  Its skyhigh PE is supposed based on a future where Tesla grows at over 100% per year. They will be lucky to grow by 20% this year, and so even with a big premium from his fan club TSLA shouldn't be more than a 40 PE which is about a 55% haircut from here. But more fairly TSLA deserves a 30 PE or a 70% drop.\n\nMusk fans also say he had no choice but to sell ten billion in stock at the highs. yes he did. he just doesn't want you to think about the fact he knows his own stock is grossly overvalued.  At least not until he tweets another brain  fart and tells you it's overvalued, or that Dogecoin is worthless and a scam, or that he really doesn't want to run TSLA anymore he has better things to do, like land Androids on Mars.\n\nAlso, AAPL has double the profit margin as TSLA, 43 to 21, and it makes what Tesla makes in one quarter in about five days.  So why then is TSLA valued at about 33% of AAPL? makes no sense. Plus if Apple enters the car market they will take a big piece out of Tesla's hide."

Or do you only take the FCF number of the last quarter as denominator?\\n\\nSo free cash flow was **$3.3B** in Q3-2022, **$0.6B** in Q2-2022, **$2.2B** in Q1-2022 and **$2.8B** in Q4-2021, those 4 FCF numbers combined gives **$8.9B**.\\n\\n**With current market cap of $649B, does that mean current P/FCF is** (649/8.9=) **73?** Or do you take only the FCF number of the last quarter which would give (649/3.3=) **197** which is even more extreme. Hope somebody can clarify with the above example. Thanks.\"",

     "What do you want to use this number to? I often see investors get \"number-fixated\". they simply geek too much down into the numbers without actually looking at the business and first understand the product and technology that the company is offering. In Teslas case this is much more important: from numbers alone you have no change of getting a sense of the market share that Tesla has the potential to capture - you have to understand it strengts in product and technology like FSD, AI, vertical integration etc. \n\nIn Teslas case these numbers - like P/E and P/FCF are close to worthless. Let me ask you this - how useful would these numbers have been in the middle of 2019 (right before Tesla grew more than 800% in one year). The answer is that they were useless."

So it's certainly a good thing to invest in.\n\nI have money in Tesla because they have strong financials and good growth outlook. People have been concerned about them cutting prices but theyre going to be selling more cars as the EV market gets bigger which should even things out + it really hurts the smaller EV companies as they have to compete with lower prices while having much worse financials.

Last but not least Elon might get spanked but I don't see that as an impediment for the company. \n\nBiggest risk: self-driving software.  The big bettors believe TSLA has a huge lead in this tech, and the success of this product is anticipated in the current stock price.  If someone else beats TSLA to the punch, the stock price could take a major hit.\n\nThe second biggest risk is: New models!  TSLA is starting to look like a generic car where I live.

We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think \"gambling\" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.\n\nIf you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.\n\nI think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important."

     ">Sofi: Millennials like me do not like banks. Why would anyone with a brain use these shitty companies?\n\nYou know that Sofi is a bank? Additionally those \"shitty\" companies provide loans etc. There is a reason why those companies existed since 1870s or even longer. They also lose money and SBC is more than 1/2 of revenues. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla: Think Tesla is just vehicles? Think again. I see Tesla continuing to dominate the EV market over the next decade and beyond but also see them helping to invent some outstanding products that are not vehicle related at all.\n\nTesla only makes money selling cars. So yes they are just vehicles. They are getting outsold in Europe by the VW Group and Stellantis - and in China by BYD. At the same time they are valued as tho they are worth more than most other car companies combined. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Alphabet: Today (10/26/2022) was a bad day for Alphabet (missed earnings). Don't let this fool you. Once the recession is over (I know I am just another internet stranger but I would say the recession is over in mid 2024) Alphabet will begin to soar and will as always be in almost every crevice of our lives like it has been the past 2 decades.\n\nLet's see how bad this ad cycle can get. This is at least a somewhat sensible company, even if I think its expensive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Roblox: I think of all 5 stocks listed in STARS this one is the most undervalued at the moment. If you believe even a little in the Metaverse then Roblox should be your pick, in my opinion over Meta in fact.\n\n500m in loses in a year, growth slowing down and loses accelerating. 2b in revenue and close to 30b in market cap. Also that SBC\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Salesforce: Tbh I think Salesforce when looking at everything (P/E ratio, earnings, etc) is a little overvalued. Long term this stock is a winner. This company does excellent work, I use them for my workplace all the time and no complaints.\n\nGreat that they are super overvalued, growth is slowing down here as well. They have high SBC and overspend on acquiring companies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>. Take the advice above and tweak it. Let me know if STARS is a good investment or if it should be altered somehow.\n\nThis portfolio will make more money as a short, than long in the next 3 years."

My long term goal is passive income generation, though I don't chase yields. I don't pay much attention to valuation or macro, as I think that since I plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month, those don't matter to me much. I invest regularly every month, so I'm okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times. In my opinion, buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company. That said, if I see an undervalued stock I like, I don't hesitate to buy more and when I make my regular contributions, I try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued. My last review in one of these was [Dec 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6bdjt/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread/hn1ot2t/). Since then, I have made some adjustments, mostly by researching new companies and updating what I focus on when doing my analysis. I am pretty comfortable with my current portfolio and can see myself holding any of these companies for decades (that surely won't be the case, but I'm okay with that; not all of these will be good investments, but most of them should, I think).\n\nMy goal is not doing 50% in a year or buying low and selling high. My goal is to outperform the index modestly, at maybe 2-3% annually, which would compound very nicely over decades. I'm okay with the risk that I underperform at a modest rate. I want to avoid making drastic changes to my portfolio depending on macro environment.\n\nI like stocks that are quality companies with:\n\n-\tA sustainable business model - high cash flow generation, high ROIC / ROCE, good balance sheet. Bonus points for recurring, diversified revenue, and optionality.\n-\tBusiness model and products I understand, or at least understand their value. I don't think I'll ever understand ASML's machines, but I understand why it's one of a kind company.\n-\tA wide moat. Bonus points are for brand value, network effect, IP, barriers to entry / high switching costs, supply chain, etc. I am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem. Almost every company I own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist.\n-\tHigh margins. I focus mostly on gross margin, but consider other margin metrics, too.\n-\tSustainable buybacks and dividend growth.\n-\tGreat management.\n\nNot every company I own scores high in each of these, but together they fit my investment goals very well.\n\nI used to have an allocation for growth in my portfolio, but overtime, I have decided to fully target quality companies and compounders with a great track record. I realized that it is never too late to buy into a company once it becomes profitable and sustainable. And if I miss a few 10-baggers because of restraint from unprofitable companies, I'll be okay with that.\n\nMy current allocation is 96% equity, with the rest being a single commodity holding - a carbon allowance ETF (CARB on BIT)\n\nOf the 96% equity, 1/3 (32%) is in diversified ETFs:\n\n| **Name**                 | **Target allocation** |\n|--------------------------|----------------------:|\n| **MSCI World**           | 14,0%                 |\n| **MSCI World Quality**           | 10,0%                 |\n| **MSCI World Small Cap** | 4,0%                  |\n| **MSCI EM IMI**          | 4,0%                  |\n\nThe other 2/3s are stocks, structured as following, ordered by my target weight (descending):\n\n| **Name**                        | **Ticker** | **Target allocation** |\n|---------------------------------|:----------:|----------------------:|\n| **Microsoft**                   | MSFT       | 6,00%                 |\n| **Apple**                       | AAPL       | 5,50%                 |\n| **ASML Holding**                | ASML       | 5,50%                 |\n| **Brookfield Corporation**      | BN         | 4,00%                 |\n| **Costco**                      | COST       | 4,00%                 |\n| **MasterCard**                  | MA         | 4,00%                 |\n| **Novo Nordisk**                | NVO        | 4,00%                 |\n| **Ulta Beauty**                 | ULTA       | 4,00%                 |\n| **Visa**                        | V          | 4,00%                 |\n| **Alphabet**                    | GOOG       | 4,00%                 |\n| **Johnson and Johnson**         | JNJ        | 3,00%                 |\n| **Home Depot**                  | HD         | 3,00%                 |\n| **Lockheed Martin**             | LMT        | 3,00%                 |\n| **Union Pacific**               | UNP        | 3,00%                 |\n| **Intuitive Surgical**          | ISRG       | 2,50%                 |\n| **Adobe**                       | ADBE       | 2,50%                 |\n| **Brookfield Asset Management** | BAM        | 2,00%                 |\n\nEdit: I also have two retirement accounts that are both 100% MSCI World."

     "Decided I want to reduce my portfolio allocation to individual stocks and reinvest the proceeds back into index funds. I got serious about investing at the end of 2021 (great timing I know) and while I still want to devote a small portion of my portfolio to stock picks, I admit I got carried away early on and ended up holding about 35 different companies at one point. I've trimmed that down to 28 now, but I'm still wasting too much time stressing over earnings calls and company-specific risks. Currently I have about 40% of my portfolio in individual stocks but I'd like to cut that down to 20-25% by the end of this year, though I'll hold certain positions longer if I can avoid realizing losses or paying unnecessary taxes.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the recent mini-rally in tech I am now at break even or slightly positive on a number of stocks including ABNB, AMD, CRM, MSFT, MU, SPOT, and TTD. Seems like a good time to decide which of these tickers I should reduce exposure to, sell completely, or hold for the long term. I'm also bagholding others including UPST (-68%) and ZIM (-53%) which I'm not sure if I should just cut loose or hold and hope for better days (these were by far my worst picks at the valuations they were at).\r  \n\r  \nI'm done with stock picking going forward unless I have really strong conviction in a company or I feel the risk/reward ratio is overwhelmingly in its favor and it has multibagger potential. Just wondering out loud trying to figure out my exit strategies at this point...tempted to just cut loose all the tickers I listed above at Monday open (together they make up about 10% of my overall portfolio). I'm not really trying to time the market, I just want more peace of mind by putting that money into index funds instead (though I'd likely DCA the proceeds over the next several months given the current market volatility).\r  \n\r  \nHowever, of the stocks I listed above, I'm most inclined to keep AMD, CRM, and TTD.... AMD because I respect Lisa Su and think they'll continue taking market share from Intel and compete with NVDA for the foreseeable future, CRM because I think with all those activist investors and Marc Benioff returning as CEO the company is hyper focused on increasing profitability, and TTD because despite their lofty valuation they have a massive TAM and are destroying earnings every quarter with significant tailwinds once we get past this bearish cycle.\r  \n\r  \nI'm welcome to any and all thoughts including roasting me for my previous stock picks \ud83d\ude02"

     "TLDR: $META 32%, $NU 25%, $CROX 18%, $NET 10%, $MSFT 7%, $ASO 7%\n\nI've been thinking about how to pick stocks, and what I came up with is I'm   \ntrying to give 2 value estimates \u2014 \"optimistic\" and \"pessimistic\". Note   \nthat I have no idea how to properly value companies, but I read   \nquarterly reports and try to make sense of the numbers, but mostly   \nintuitively. Currently, I use google sheets where every stock has   \na current price and my estimates, giving me an overview of how much upside  \n and downside the stocks have. When I get a paycheck, I try to pick   \nstocks that have less downside, and more upside, and also that don't skew my portfolio   \ntoo much.\n\nNow here is about individual stocks, with my high/low estimates:\n\n- **Meta**, 300B/600B. Media mostly talks about the metaverse being a flop and Apple getting in the way of their tracking, but I think its fall to 10PE was overblown. They actually spend more money on AI than on VR, and they also said that they have good results from AI used for advertising, so they don't see Apple policies being a major problem for them.\n- **Nubank**, 15B/35B. I actually learned about this company before Buffett invested in it. They have interesting tech. I'm a software developer, and I love the tech stack they use (Clojure, Datomic) \u2014 it makes me feel much more productive when developing compared to other, more mainstream tech stacks like Java or Python. Also, in Russia where I used to live, before the war, there was a similarly awesome banking service (Tinkoff) that I used and loved. After moving to Europe it makes me sad to see how far behind other banks here, even the more progressive ones. \n- **Crocs**, 5B/13B. It was a fucking steal at 5PE ($50) in the summer. I guess it fell so much because of the debt fears and rates rising. But I still buy it even at $120. I think, with their HeyDude's acquisition, and good debt management they still have room to grow. \n- **Cloudflare**, 8B/30B. Quite a big spread in estimates because I'm not sure about this company. I mostly bought it because I thought there would be a lot of demand for it because of ChatGPT, and possibly other AI services that are free to the users but pricey to run, hence requiring a middleman to prevent misuse. I now see that Microsoft's newer GPT model is significantly cheaper to run, so maybe there will be less demand for Cloudflare. I'll probably sell it soon. Although they seem to be focusing on profitability, so, they might continue to rise.\n- **Microsoft**, 1691B/2150B. Quite safe, will most probably continue growing, but maybe not by as much as other, smaller companies.\n- **Academy Sports + Outdoors**, 5B/6B. Note that they currently have less than a 5B market cap, so my guesstimates say there is no downside. Not sure why I thought so, maybe they have good shareholder's equity and earnings... Anyway, it's not a bigger part of my portfolio because they might not be growing as fast as I'd like. But maybe I should sell Cloudflare and buy more ASO...\n\nAlso, here are some companies I'm thinking to look closer into:\n\n- RH \u2014 though maybe will be growing only once the rates start to fall\n- RBLX \u2014 it's misleading that they don't earn money because they use accounting tricks to pay fewer taxes (deferred revenue)\n- BLDR \u2014 growing, low PE...\n\nWhat do you think?"

The CEO has often commented on Teslas stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. \\n\\nIn 2020, when Teslas stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was too high. It sent Teslas stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.\\n\\nTesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.\\n\\nWall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them.

     "My 2 Cents as a Noob.\n\nI\u2019ve said this before, and I\u2019ll say it again: \n\nNo offense, but it stumps me when, even Tesla owners, continue to compare a Tesla with other EVs. To me, it is like you are comparing Apples and stones (or was I supposed to say Oranges here?)\n\nEvery Tesla Auto is an EV, but not every EV is a Tesla. Do cars have 4 wheels? Yes. Do cars have a way to run? Yes, they do. But that does not make any EV Manufacturer a competitor to Tesla. Tesla is a Computer on Wheels that is going to further blow any competition out of the water with FSD (doesn\u2019t matter when it releases to the Public). \n\nTesla has been, is, and will always be ahead of 99% of the Competition. IMHO. \n\nIn my mind, Tesla is spelled like this \u201c**S**-**Y**-**N**-**E**-**R**-**G**-**Y**\u201d.\n\nThe Competition: \n\n(1) Is late in the race by at least a decade;\n\n(2) Is still focused on ICE Cars, for most part, since it is their bread and butter - they cannot just abandon suddenly, what they have been good at doing for close to 100 years (and is still earning them $$$$$$$) and run a race on a totally different track that would add to their Revenues several years/decades (?) down the line to match what they have been making for so long. Most of their resources are still focused on keeping these Revenue streams flowing - and while they continue to do this, Tesla will, as usual, continue to focus all it\u2019s energies to moving forward in the EV-space.\n\n(3) Will be spending their time, effort and money trying to bring down Tesla or to slowing Tesla down - again a distraction from their goal to accomplish FSD.\n\n(4) will be aiming at where Tesla is right now, and by the time years roll by and the competition reaches Tesla\u2019s capabilities, in terms of Range, driving technology etc., Tesla would already have moved further up in these and other new capabilities.\n\n(5) Will continue to sell through their Dealers-with lesser maintenance being required on EVs (compared to ICE), the middleman will try to make more money on each Sale, adding no value  as such, but, at the same time, adding and passing the additional cost to the Buyer. The last time we bought an ICE Car (tho it was also fun at some level, and a good learning experience for my son who was buying it), I hated having to spend 5 hours at the Dealership haggling the price down from $35,000 to $24,000 (which is  68% of the price that was first quoted - I\u2019m really amazed that the ICE Dealerships have that kind of power and those kind of margins!) No wonder the Dealership Association have been up in arms against the Tesla sell-direct-to-Customer model. And this campaign by them has been supported full-heartedly by the ICE Companies and their Unions, since their individual and combined existence is in peril, and they would be willing do anything to stop Tesla\u2019s continued progress.\n\nIt is going to be a very steep uphill journey for the behemoths to overcome the inertia (or the lack thereof) to reach where Tesla is at, and also keep up with the innovation that Tesla has been, and will continue to drive, for it\u2019s \u201cFan Boys\u201d and \u201cFan Gals\u201d - we are (almost?) a cult now \ud83d\ude09. You will not be able to move the needle for me from my love for Tesla.\n\nMy prediction: While all the other Auto Companies continue to struggle to play-catch-up with Tesla, by 2035, I think the Tesla Stock has the potential to rise to $6,000 from where it is now (and, of course, we can expect it to have split further by then)."

If Tesla hands out the FSD tech, they might as well kill their own car business. Battery tech is where the Chinese (CATL, BYD) and Koreans are going to lead (Samsung). \n\nAlso it's ridiculous that same people believe they can keep up that growth factors until they sell like 15+ million cars a year. First of all you gotta find the double amount of buyers each year. 100-200k per year isn't that hard, especially when you have a lot of hype and fanboys. The main problem is getting the average buyer to get one of these instead of an VW or Toyota. It's getting harder from now on."

     "I'm buying. A lot. I think everyone who doesn't own TSLA is going to get left in the dust. In about 10 years Tesla is going to be the mega monster of all companies. If they have full self driving AND autonomous robots, then Tesla is going to have a totally robotic driverless car fleet AND robotic deliverymen. It wont be just \"robo-taxis\" -- it will be \"robo-everything\". Robots will be packing and delivering your parcels, and your food. Every warehouse and shipping system where things are moved by humans couod be replaced with Tesla bots. I don't think any company is going to be able to keep up with what's coming down the pipe. The barrier to entry will be just so huge. Its not like Ford is going to come out of left field and come up with a Dojo processor and full self driving system.\n\nIf you havent seen the Dojo presentation, you should. Everyone who thinks other car manufacturers are going to be going down this same road and outmatch Tesla are out of touch.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DSw3IwsgNnc"

     "Personally, I always thought the stock was over valued for a few reasons: EV market share will diminish over time (look at Ford and Toyota in the ICE vehicle market), precious metals for battery tech are diminishing, Tesla notoriously lacks QA and so reviews for build quality have given them a blemish there as other quality EVs show up, bad press from recent battery explosions and autopilot harming/killing pedestrians, he put up shares as collateral for his Twitter bid, and finally - Elon musk is incredibly unpredictable. His recent right-wing pandering on twitter has potentially damaged his relationship with his progressive customer base. The bullish case for Tesla is that they are not just an EV company, they also provide energy storage tech, solar panel systems both commercially and residentially, and they have the most miles of road data and LiDar data out of any major vehicle producer that is working in the AI/autopilot domains - so this gives them an edge over a long horizon, but that data may be purchasable down the road from 3rd party companies. Overall, I'm bearish on Tesla as I think it has been overvalued for a long time. Full-disclosure I do not have a position in Tesla and this is not financial advice, if Elon didn't have a cult-like following I may have shorted it by now."

If I had to put my money on a company catching lighting in a bottle multiple times, TSLA would be on the short list.\n\nAlso it should be mentioned that things like cyber truck/$25k car/semi/aircraft will double/triple previous 5 year projections, along with economies of scale giving them better margins and the increasing price of FSD, exporting and licensing battery technology, and a million other little things that are always looming on the horizon could end up adding a lot more value than anticipated.\n\nCould be the first $100 trillion company 80 years from now who knows.\n\nStill like the risk reward better at $500/share"

     "I believe 2023 will tell the tale. I mean the projected worst case is at 2 million cars sold.  My big question is: will there be enough people buying $50K cars .   Once Berlin and Texas fully ramps up: will there still be consistent appetite for $60K model Y and $45K model 3? \nThe projected worse case revenue is $100 billion.  \n1) USA: To put things in perspective: Rav-4 and CR-4 sells about 750K cars per year in the USA. They average about $30K/car.  Will Tesla be able to convert  buyers of $30K rav-4/CR-V to buy 750K model Y EVERY YEAR?? It will be daunting.  they might be able to do with model Y SR: but the revenue will be lower.  Personally: between friends, co-workers, and family: I don't know anyone that drives a >$50K ~~subcompact~~ compact suv.  They all drive rav-4, cr-v, tuscon/santa fe, rogue, forester, outback, escape, etc...I am unsure how many of those folks will buy a model y in the next 3 years....If I had to guess, maybe 1 or 2.  The rest: if they trade in: they will get one of the aformentioned vehicles.  \n2) China:  competition is fierce: the model Y already has SR version: revenue for this will be lower.  Berlin will open up: how many $50K model y/model 3 can tesla china sell?  most of model 3 sold in china is <$40K. and model Y sr in china is only $42K. \n3) Berlin:  I suppose tesla can still sell 500K model y/3 every year but competition is also fierce in Europe.  \n4) Cybertruck: this probably can only be sold in the USA/Canada: just too big for the rest of the world. there is a reason why #1 pick up truck in the world outside of north america is the Toyota Hilux.  I doubt Tesla can sell 1 million of these every year in the USA \n5) There is a reason the market cap for all automotive (ex-tesla) is only around $1.5 trillion.  Not everyone can afford $60K model y or $45K model 3.  That's why there is a lot of corolla, civic, accord, rav-4, etc. sold.  People who look to buy these cars are not going to cross shop with model y or model 3.  The argument againststhis will be: what if tesla makes model 2?? ok, they can; but revenue will be a lot lower.\n6)  Competition: Model Y and Model 3 are good cars. but they are quite expensive.  Tesla can own the upper echelon of electric cars. But luxury competition is there or will be there: ie. Lucid, Rivian, Audi/Porsche, BMW, Mercedes, etc...Yes those may not be #1 but they will get some market share. Then you add RNM, Toyota, hyundai/kia, Volkswagen group, Stellantis, Honda, and a bunch of Chinese companies then it becomes even more difficult. \n7) So I believe the only way for Tesla to achieve such high net income is through other means: this remains to be seen.  over 90% of their revenue is cars though. \n8) Capitalism doesn't allow dominance with high operative margins consistently on things that are capital intensive (ie. cars, airplanes, boats, computer hardware, etc.).  It is software that can do that.  Tesla has to prove that it can make money in software (which they might: they have been able to convince so many people to pay $10K for FSD...will they continue to be able to do so??). \n9) at $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap.  To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???\n10) Saying all this shorting TSLA is crazy"

Their TTM free cash flow was 4.1B, so current P/FCF is around 267. Last time companies had triple digit multiples was the Dot Com bubble, and that worked out spectacularly well, right?

I know that's not how tsla works though...\n\nWhat other company is priced for perfect execution? If Intel were given this trust (assuming their ambitious fabrication build out will just be successful), it would be trading at $150, but no sane investor would consider that a reasonable price, and that's a company that is already doing $18 billion per year in earnings."

The company might see at most a 20-30% drawdown which is in line with what can happen to any other large cap, in response to a bad report or bad macro environment. \n\nWhile their reports pre-2020 showed flat revenues as they had constant issues from cash flow and production... their most recent report showed that the market WAS correct in their FORWARD outlook on TSLA and priced it correctly.\n\nThat's what investing is about - sometimes you don't believe in a company where you should have believed. Sometimes you believe in a company and they let you down.\n\nRemember there were many redditors who were bullish on NIO, BABA, PLTR at the beginning of 2021 and they have failed spectacularly. \n\nInstead of crying about valuation, bears just have to accept they were wrong on TSLA and move on. Being unable to admit that as an investor is a bad sign - means you're investing with emotions and pride rather than pure logic."

Or even Giga Austin also gets delayed as well. Also running into issues with China is also always a possibility. You also have a \u201cworst case\u201d P/E in 2024 of 48 for over a 1 trillion dollar company doing 138 billion dollars in revenue and this is assuming they are still producing high numbers. I get it at the end of the day investing is all about speculation but when I invest or put money towards something I really want to make sure my money is safe by absolutely assuming worst case scenario because at the end of the day nothing ever goes as planned and life and stuff happens. For example one of my favorite stocks is NEE. I was in the $60-$68 range. A lot of people were buying this stick in the hopes of a government deal in congress. When that deal got delayed the stock sold off. The questions I asked myself was what if the government deal didnt go through and they didnt get funding, what if they keep issuing shares(which your analysis didnt mention even though share dilution is a huge part that people rarely pay attention too), what if there are issues with their expansion as in they are delayed and they will be unable to expand production in the Midwest due to government issues or competition. The question is if all these things happen will I still be buying the stock? If the answer is no then I am not investing. Your worst case scenario seems to assume Elons or Wallstreets worst case scenario which is still really far up there. At the end of the day I like to make sure as much as possible that my money is secure by increasing my chances and decreasing my risk by assuming things on the worst side because life is unpredictable and you still assumed everything being in track in your worst case scenario. Overall I really cant take your analysis seriously and I know already that Tesla fanboys are going to come at me saying \u201cyour just mad you missed the boat\u201d. Yeah your probably right but I would rather miss the boat then be on it when it starts to sink. This can happen due to Fed starting to taper which greatly effects high valued growth stocks or fundamentals coming back to play which it always has in the past but nobody knows when.

     "This post, like most posts about Tesla is comparing the trend set for the last years of a company being the leader in EV technology, they still are, but the other companies are getting better and the lead of Tesla is shrinking. The Automobile sales are mostly \u201eemotional sales\u201c and Tesla is not as popular in Europe and China as it is in the USA. It must be noted that these markets are bigger than the US market and will have a larger impact on future sales growth. A look at the future P/E ratios show that 2024 ratios would be justified if the share price will remain where it is.\nInvesting in a company that will be priced the same in 2 years is not what most Tesla investors are having in mind IMO.\n\nStill Tesla has a great future, if it is as great as the current stock price predicts or greater, that is a matter not only of Tesla, but also of the available products of their competitors and the sales they can generate. Buying an EV was much more a question to buy A Tesla or a combustion car in the past and more a question of which one to buy in the future. \nThe valuations of other car manufacturers are not the same, because they are only making little of their revenue from the growing EV market and much more on the shrinking combustion engine market. With increasing EV sales this will change. If and at what point the EV sales will surpass the total Automobile sales worldwide is still in question, because having an automobile is not as desirable as it used to be and car sharing and public transportation is rising as well. ( my thoughts on Tesla and the limits to the growing EV market is bullish, but not as bullish as the market is)"

Right now a model 3 lead time is at the end of 2022 (supply chain issue finally caught up to them). Imagine when there\u2019s no constraint and you can order a Tesla and get delivery notice literally in a few weeks to a month. If Hertz 100K order is green (down payment was paid) then I can see how Tesla will need another Giga factory soon.\n\nIn addition, SpaceX is also part of Tesla and they will send another crew of 4 NASA astronauts to the ISS by Halloween (they charged NASA 50 mil per round trip seat I believed) not to mention countless supply transport to the ISS as well as satellite launches for the US government which did not come cheap. SpaceX reusable rockets and boosters allow them to just printing money as their OpCost is minimum. Etc.\n\nDo they deserve a trillion dollar company? Yes if they execute it right and keep sticking to the dirty politic play by the US government and their UAW. GM and Ford would rather play politics than actual try to play catch up and if Elon manage to poach Diess to their side, I can see their share hit 2000s range soon.

You should compare them to other companies in and out of the industry to show correlation. \n\nMy biggest pain when talking about Tesla stock is everyone says they aren\u2019t a car company, they\u2019re a tech company.  I get where they are coming from but what do they sell? Cars.  So they are an automotive company.  Until they franchise out their tech they are just a car company and their quality control is terrible at that. \n\nQuickly comparing numbers for Tesla, sales volume in cars last year was 500k which is just a small fraction compared to other companies (1/4 for Toyota, 1/5 for Ford) in the US and others sell more outside the US.   Personally I don\u2019t believe they have the sales to make their evaluation something that will last.  I know theirs more to it but I\u2019m not writing a post about the financials right now. \n\nIt\u2019s a fad stock, the first one in awhile since Apple, but it\u2019s a fad stock that doesn\u2019t equate to the performance of what Apple was able to achieve.  You\u2019d have to compare it to maybe Facebook in regards to fad stocks and even then I think Facebook isn\u2019t as overly invested in as Tesla is."

     "TSLA has experienced extraordinary growth over the last two years, but what I find remarkable about them is their fundamentals actually look cheaper now than they did before the start of the bull run. Let's imagine TSLA was producing the same earnings and sales but at a January 2020 valuation.\n\nTSLA | Current Price | Jan 2020 Price\n|-|-|-|\n|Market Cap|$1073B|$87B|\n|P/E|361|25|\n|Forward P/E|143.4|11.6|\n|PEG|4.95|0.40|\n|P/S|22.9|1.86|\n|P/B|43.6|3.5|\n\nTSLA was around an $87B company at the start of 2020. I look at these numbers and think, despite the popular sentiment at the time, that TSLA was an absolute bargain at its 2020 prices. Despite what most people would've told you at the time, their price back then was absurdly low. TSLA's projected 5-year EPS growth is actually higher now (73% per year) than it was at the start of 2020 (around 50%). To me the lesson is if you think the market has fundamentally mispriced something, have some humility and consider the market may know something you don't."

There is more demand for their cars than can be made. The number of cars that they produce will double after Texas and Berlin come online. Tesla\u2019s multiple will be at 6x after these plants come online which is in line w other high growth industries like software. Other existing plants are also being expanded. Tesla could use all of the money it\u2019s gotten from shareholders to build more plants than are currently known or accounted for. Hertz is a game changer and other car rental businesses will have to follow suit or go bankrupt. Any company that uses a fleet of vehicles has to seriously consider why it\u2019s not transitioning over to Tesla. The last time Tesla hit $1500 they split the stock. They\u2019re just $250 away from that price. The full power of Tesla\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t even hit full stride yet. They built their own chips for this and nobody else is even close. The AI will have applications beyond just cars. Industry titans like GM and Volkswagen are dead men walking and they know it. Their leadership have already admitted that they will need at least 5 years to catch up to where Tesla is now, assuming that Tesla stops innovating today. That is a ton of capacity and market share open for Tesla to take over."

     "I find that the people who tend to dislike Tesla are individuals from these three groups:\n\n1. Upset they didn't invest in Tesla.\n2. Dislike Musk.\n3. Don't really understand the direction of this company or the numbers behind it.\n\nYou have some saying 1.4 million deliveries is unrealistic for y2022 and says you're being way too optimistic. If that individual did any research, they would know that y2020, Tesla did 500,000 vehicle deliveries. This year, they are projected to do 900,000 to 970,000 vehicles. That's nearly a 100% increase. 1.4 million is definitely possible next year if the timeline for the factories is operating as intended and if Tesla can manage the chip supply chain better than expected. But I don't think this individual even knows about the new factories being operational soon.\n\nWhat people aren't realizing is that Tesla is the most vertically integrated automanufacturer in the world. Being less dependent on other suppliers significantly increases their supply chain processing and leads to higher margins which at this point, I believe is the most profitable mass selling vehicle in the market. Definitely for EV's. Very few were creating supplies for EV vehicles so Tesla took it upon themselves to develop it on their own so they can properly control their production the best way possible. These other legacy manufacturers are lagging behind severely.\n\nYou have another showing numbers from Europe EV sales without realizing that Tesla has yet to even crack the European market because legitimately, EVERY vehicle Tesla produces is sold and because of huge demand in areas where they produce the vehicles, they can't get any to Europe without it being sold already intra-country.\n\nWhat OP hasn't even mentioned in detail are Tesla's other projects. If they weren't working extensively on these other projects and strictly focused on pushing out as many vehicles as possible, they would be crushing the profit. Their software is going to take some time to pay dividends but it will get to the point where you will buy a Tesla not just because of the performance but because the software is significantly ahead of their competitors.\n\nLet's also talk about the fact that new Tesla vehicles sold in America currently do not receive any federal tax credit and hasn't for many years. Yet vehicles are consistently flying off the shelves.\n\nAnother thing is Tesla's 'Model 2' which is designed to introduce an even more affordable mass-market EV in the likes that no other EV company will come close to replicating for the foreseeable future. Couple this Model 2, projected to be under $25,000 with federal and state subsidies, it will be stupid not to buy a Model 2 if you want the best performance for the best buck, dollar-for-dollar.\n\nI'm loving the direction Tesla is going. Constantly innovating while other EV manufacturers are behind. Some want to go fully EV by 2035. We all know why they won't go fully EV now... because they don't have the expertise, capacity, and capabilities to transition from ICE to EV without ruining their sales. I doubt they are making any profits on their EV's which is why GM doesn't even report EV numbers data separately as it would cause investors to pressure GM on their EV initiative.\n\nI'm not selling any of my shares for the next 5-6 years. If people think Tesla is a fad and that other companies are 'catching up', they don't understand the business. If they think Tesla is sitting idle and would just allow other companies to catch up when Musk is arguably the most innovative individual in the corporate business world we've seen in the last half-century, they are mistaken. This company constantly works on creating innovative technology and products. By the time those legacy manufacturers think they caught up, they are years behind what Tesla has planned already."

If 10.4 is the same or larger then I\u2019ll probably move my timelines up. If not, I might trim my positions(maybe). I\u2019m also curious to how it will handle snow/ice come winter."

Their cars are popular because they not only look good and perform well but have a longer range than most other electric cars.\n2. Solar roof and Powerwall *can* supply a more convenient solar experience for homeowners.\n3. Megapack has saved many cities/states/countries millions of dollars preventing/supplementing power outages.\n4. All of this is facilitated by cutting edge battery tech being developed in-house.\n\n5. Other point - Tesla is trying to revolutionize the manufacturing process by creating the machines that build the machines.\n\nI've been holding TSLA for 5+ years and there is definitely hype and overvaluation, but they are here to stay and their numbers just keep getting better. I will hold until I ABSOLUTELY NEED the money, which I hope is never."

It'll only cost you 1-1.5 hours a week, and once you hear every single detail of news that's coming out about Tesla every single day, you'll realize Tesla does more noteworthy stuff in a week than most automakers do in a year. \n\nAlso, if you enjoy the technical side of things, watch some videos of Sandy Munro talking about Tesla's advantages over the others and keep in mind that this guy was extremely critical of Tesla until he saw the improvements of the Model Y's production quality over the Model 3."

     "I'm not invested in Tesla, so I consider myself relatively neutral about it.\n\nImo anyone trying to justify the current valuation with car sales projections is crazy. They won't retain market share because of competition, and yes there will be harsh competition in EV. This is obvious.\n\nTesla has two things that could justify this price:\n1) vertical integration (or whatever it's called). Basically what Amazon does, but with cars. So once you scale you start to produce your own parts (e.g. batteries) cutting out intermediaries. \n2) Side businesses. Battery packs, solar roofs and this kind of stuff. Basically they expand their competences in other somewhat related fields. I wouldn't be surprised seeing them into domotic systems soon in the future. To all this you can add the subscription services for the car, which basically will be like \"pay every month for updates and cool stuff, otherwise use the basic system which will suck the more your car age\" (My personal prediction)\n\nSo I believe these are all great things and there is a lot of potential. However I don't like the price from a risk perspective. Give me whatever performance prediction you want, 300 P/E is too much for me even under the most optimistic assumptions. I would honestly have problems at 100 P/E.\n\nThis said, I hope they will succeed in everything (including that humanoid robot) and everyone holding it in their portfolio will make a shit ton of money."

Now I own a Tesla and everybody who we have let drive it falls in love with it and wants one of their own. \n\nThe implications of Full-Self-Driving are also amazing - especially for me as a blind person. I never gave a fuck about cars in my life, but I'm so into our Tesla despite not being able to drive it. I took great pains to make sure I could be listed as an owner despite being blind. I can take a more active role in its maintenance and everyday activities, and they get better with every update.\n\nI get that Tesla hasn't sold as many cars as Ford or other car companies, but Nokia was once selling more phones than iPhone, too.\n\nOh, and from a stock perspective I also like that Elon is aware of the shorts and will actively try to bust them when possible. He's just a CEO who feels slightly less out of touch than other CEOs, I guess."

Use price to sales ratio similar to other growth companies. \n\nFactories. It's about the machine that builds the machine. GM, VW, Ford can't compete with Teslas output efficiency. Anyway focus just on Profit per Factory. \n\nTesla made 1.5 Billion net profit last Q with 2 factories while building 2 factories wtf. With 4 Factories = 4B minimum per Quarter(1 Billion per F per Q). So thats 16 Billion per year Net profit just on cars. Play with this number. \n\nNow add FSD, solar, charging network and Mega pack sales. I see 50 percent improvement in profit per factory once completed. 6B X 4F =24B/yr Net Profit on cars only! So multiply 24B x future PE ratio. Amzn has a pe ratio of over 100. If you take just 80 PE x 24 Billion =1.92 TRILLION. \n\nTesla can build a new factory with 1.5 Billion.

And then of course there is the energy grid business with solar and battery packs that is in its baby phase.  someday when the cars battery packs can last a million miles it will be used for energy storage/resell...storing solar and cheaper power from the grid late at night to resell at peak usage hours.\n\nAs an auto company alone 1500-2000/sh is a bear case, if they hit on FSD or energy then the stock is dirt cheap right now."

     "There are so many reasons. \n\n1. Tesla's mission is to \"accelerate the transformation to sustainable energy\".  Energy and auto are two of the largest markets, and can support multi-trillion valuations for an industry leader in both. The way the world is trending with climate change batteries are an extremely valuable commodity. They plan on becoming the largest battery producer within the decade. It's amazing their pilot line is one of the top 10 plants in the world.\n2. They years ahead of Western world auto competition due to continued innovation and starting with a blank slate. The charging network is incredibly valuable. Their vehicles provide an excellent consumer experience. Competitors can't catch up due to differences in talent, culture and organization.\n3. Tesla and SpaceX are the most sought employers for new engineers, they take the best and brightest. They are changing the world for the better and driving innovation, it's incredibly wholesome and people genuinely want to help provided a solution to climate change. This resource alone is a huge competitive advantage.\n4. Culture, it's okay to fail and take risks to make the product better, fear of failure is reduced which leads to better design. Their is a 'first principles' approach that creates better products. \n5. Manufacturing will be their key long-term competitive advantage. Automation and building the machine that builds the machine, parts reduction and innovation driven by culture and talent makes the difference.  Giga castings, structural batteries are not easily replicable innovations and will improve gross margins to roughly 40%, way above competitors. Shanghai factory is the first iteration from their original factory and is very likely the most efficient and highest margin auto factory in the world. Berlin and Texas will have noticeable improvements over Shanghai.\n6. Tesla is only just starting to take off and ramp, they are the Apple of the 2020's. The ecosystem and abundance of high profit opportunities is underappreciated. FSD, subscriptions, in-car software, charging, charging locations retail and insurance. Insurance is a sleeper, that will disrupt the industry. They have such a massive moat with individual driver data they can obtain maybe 50% gross margin from insurance while still offering lower rates by attracting the safest drivers with their safety score. \n7. Energy business will be bigger than auto, in the next year or two their megapack sales will 10x as they have 10x capacity coming online. They are backed up 1-2 years in orders and there is only more coming with more wind and solar going online every year. They recently were approved to be an energy operator in Texas, big money from energy arbitrage and auto-bidder is expected. \n8. FSD will fundamentally change transportation. \n9. Average selling prices are going up from massive demand and costs held, then will go down from 4680's and giga castings, factory iteration etc. This means more profit per car and also the number of cars produced is growing exponentially. 50% per unit growth for the decade is the goal. This year will be about 80-90%, Next year might be the same with two massive factories ramping. \n10. Q4 earnings might double from Q3. The P/E is going to be under 100 in the next year or two while earnings are still going to growing crazy fast - 40% or greater per year, which easily justifies a high multiple. The sky is the limit, easy dcf calculations and reasonable projections value Tesla as a multi-trillion company in a few years.\n11. Elon, the visionary, inspiring genius physicist/engineer is charismatic and created the culture. He can imagine and create a future that people don't believe is possible, which creates immense value. \n12. There are so many more but those are the key drivers. \n13. Autonomous robots. This is huge, project dojo and chip design. \n\nPlease check out Rob Maurer at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSUNLyzzvWU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSUNLyzzvWU).

Given the cost advantages for Tesla from scale in EV, margins on parts, margin on DTC vs dealers Tesla should always have a better car or a lower price as long as the above factors persist. Plus Tesla has upside to build out a utility business. Imagine the disaster if a legacy auto went to cut out their dealers?"

Their own team for self driving, which may work, may not. They've got that new battery that they're trying to mass produce, and if they can get it, will mean 600mile+ cars on a single charge.  \n\nAll of that plus they have a brand like Apple, a cult like following, demand they can't keep up with, that alone might keep them relevant for a very long time.\n\nDisclaimer: I own 15 shares"

So I find the projected sales targets needed to justify Tesla's current valuation to be too optimistic, defo not outside the realms of possibility though.\n\nHydrogen will probably be the energy source of haulage class vehicles, maybe a syngas variety of fuel for ICE and then pure electric for Arcimoto/E-Bike single occupancy commuters and luxury saloons.

Granted I\u2019ve rode the Tesla wave a bit for some easy profits, but based on their capabilities and what they produce, I don\u2019t understand how they have a valuation greater than one of the major automakers while making less than 1% of cars globally. Other companies seem to have been slow to adapt but I believe as they do their manufacturing capabilities could drink Tesla\u2019s milkshake. A prime example is the Ford Mustang Mach E which was much more of a hit than Ford expected. There are also Lucid and Lordstown both gunning for the electric vehicle market. The 2022 Lucid Air is already a Motortrend Car of the Year finalist. \n\nOnce the electric pick up truck segment hits prime time, I\u2019m not sure Tesla will be able to match GM and Ford. Both companies are the go-to for work vehicles, have name recognition in the segment, loyal fan bases, an understanding of what people need capability wise, and existing relationships with purchasers. Don\u2019t worry about the cyber truck hype, this market segment benefits from the full size truck chassis being highly customizable for particular fields.\n\nThat being said I remember watching a video in math class around 1998, when we were learning about the stock market. One thing I remember from the video was how Amazon couldn\u2019t meet their valuation at the time even if they were the seller of every book sold in the world at that time.

     "Because the modern world is moving more and more toward clean energy mandates and away from fossil fuels, and Tesla is the only company in the EV space to be as far along and with as much brand recognition by several years at least. GM, Ford, Toyota are all scrambling to get their programs started while Tesla is already approaching 1,000,000 vehicles sold and delivered within a year. Their supply chain seems to be strong and they are not suffering from semiconductor or basic raw element shortages, and their battery technology and production is unrivaled, leaving many to believe they will not only be selling their own cars but selling batteries to other vehicle manufacturers who seek to compete with them. Lastly, they already have an established supercharger network that is continuing to grow. The high valuation is based on future earnings for a company that is so far ahead of any other competitor in an industry that is just beginning to boom."

     "People understand Tesla as a car company and judge them for that for those people that think they\u2019re currently over valued. The real reason they\u2019re at their valuation right now is multiple reasons:       \nCars, they\u2019re currently making 30% gross margins on their cars which is unheard of and continuing to increase this margin. They do everything in house which helps control their cost and are revolutionizing how to build a car with one example being making a car with the worlds largest cast machine, building their own batteries etc.      \nsoftware: just like Apple they control their own software and whenever they sell a car they can sell software that increases revenue. Even when it\u2019s sold as a used car in the future. They can continue to increase media and autopilot features and make subscriptions that become a huge revenue. Think about how big Netflix is off of $15 a month, now add in Tesla with their $10 a month subscription plan for internet, and $200 a month for full self driving. Their ability to charge money to unlock acceleration boost, heated seats etc.         \nsolar: not only are they selling solar to residential, they\u2019re just starting to put their foot in the door for commercial and be their own power plant for cities, this just started in Texas and will only keep expanding. Every time they install solar on a home they can have that customer opt into their micro grid power plant allowing them to use that energy to sell to the neighbors around them allowing them to have a larger play as a power plant company.        \nRobo-taxi: When they unlock this it will be a 30 trillion or more annual product, and this isn\u2019t even factored into their stock today.        \nSemi truck: When they start building this it will save companies insurmountable amounts of money on the gas they would save alone in the first year ( most semi truck drivers spend 120k on gas a year, this semi will have free charging and cost 150k making it pay for itself within a year meaning every big company will be buying them up in hordes).        \nSuperchargers: Think of these as gas stations across the country and they own and control the cost for every single one of these. Eventually when all of these have solar built on them which is what they\u2019re doing they can give you electricity back in your car for a net positive with the cost for Tesla only being to install the charging station, after that the cost is essentially free for them.          \nAI: Watch their AI day: they\u2019re working on some of the best AI in the world and will be a huge player. This will allow them to build more products like a humanoid robot which has even more potential to be huge, again this isn\u2019t even factored into their value yet.           \nThere\u2019s so much more reasons why it is just not a car company, but do some research, it\u2019s amazing and they\u2019re just getting started."

     "Regarding, Buffet's investing philosophies, just because Buffett himself is against Tesla that doesn't mean if you invest in Tesla you are going against his philosophies.\n\nBuffett himself has stated many times that technology stocks are beyond him and he doesn't invest in things he cannot understand. So rather than looking at what stocks Buffet likes or doesn't like, you should be concerned with what his mindsets are.\n\nDuring his early years, he was very much a risk taker, he researched his plays and went almost all in on his high conviction plays. If one were to do their research properly, and are convinced that a stock is a play, that is very much something Buffett would do.\n\nWith regards to their moat, it is simple, they are the best at what they do, and their only competition is themselves. The only one that can make a more profitable EV than Tesla is Tesla, each day they are outdoing themselves. Gigapress die-casting, 4680 batteries, FSD updates... the list goes on. \n\nVolume production of EV cars is an exceedingly difficult thing to do that no car manufacturers except for Tesla has cracked. Volume production of EVs is not the same as volume production of ICE cars, \"competition is coming\", I will only believe it when I see it. ICE manufacturers are currently struggling to keep volume production of EVs and they are still at negative/low margins."

     "As much I love the cars, I can\u2019t afford it. I have the money but it would be so irresponsible of me to spend on this. Mortgage, kids college, saving for retirement. I could have been driving BMWs well before Tesla came about - came \u201cthis close\u201d so many times and didn\u2019t pull the trigger. Thank god. Did I miss the \u201cultimate driving experience\u201d? Maybe. But I don\u2019t care. \n\nPpl with means will talk about \u201cbut you don\u2019t have to pay for gas!\u201d. Yes, true, but even with gas my Ford Edge comes out a few hundred cheaper per month and that\u2019s before adding in the insurance. Then tack on teen drivers. Forget it.\n\nMy point in this is that the TAM is huge and there\u2019s more than enough to go around. The competition is coming and they\u2019ll likely never be as good (although Rivian may, big may, give them a run for their money) but look at home many car companies we have today\u2026 many. They all fucked up and are years behind. But the F150 will sell, the Hummer will sell. The VM will sell. The Rivians are gorgeous and far more practical, and will sell. \n\nTSLA is a behemoth though. The FSD IP is probably worth billions alone, then comes solar power\u2026 they have a lot of room to grow. Not sure about multi-trillion though. \n\nAlso, we had an internet bubble, a housing bubble, and now we have an EV bubble brewing. So many EV makers with very few deliveries are with many billions. Will bleed at some point. TSLA is golden long term though IMO"

     "Most investors have no idea what valuation or P/E ratio means for a stock price. Neither do I. I do know a lot about Tesla and I also \"believe\" in the company.  \n\nAs a car company:\n1. They make the most compelling mass-market EV and have established brand loyalty. I fully anticipate every car will be EV or electric hybrid in the very near future. Even if you project that Tesla for 15% of the electric car market,  the move towards all electric bakes in incredible growth. \n2. MARGINS MARGINS MARGINS. I personally love my Tesla but the lack of diversity in their options is disheartening. But this is on purpose. Their vertical integration and use of robots and AI as opposed to unions and supply chain allow them to price car at greater profit margin. They also eliminate car dealers. Tesla sells a more expensive new car and gets margins of 30% versus 10% of the mold of GM. Essentially they need to sell 1/3 number of vehicles to get similar ROI or stock valuation as other companies. \n3. Charging infrastructure. One day, you will feel comfortable charging an EV anywhere. That is not today or tomorrow. The USA is not committed to this.  My best guess is that it will be 5 years or more.  As for right now,  Tesla is the only EV brand I feel safe driving around the USA with little fears on charging. That alone will keep the average consumer away from everything except tesla. This infrastructure has growth opportunities with subscription plans etc. Ask yourself, \"how much is owning the monopoly of gas station of the future worth?\"\n4. Auto insurance... yes tesla has their own. It is using AI to take data on driving behaviors so you can pay them lower insurance rates. \n5. Solar energy... it's not profitable yet but it could be\n6. Future - Uber like ride hailing and car sharing service run by tesla app only on tesla."

He wants everyone in an EV, and he knows Tesla can't possibly supply them all.\n\n**I think an interesting question to ask is, \"When EVs are the main cars being made, how will Tesla remain a leader?\"**\n\nOne big reason Tesla has done so well is that their focus was 100% on EVs. No legacy technology to consider. No legacy brands to drop. No legacy anything. Tesla was 100% focused. And that level of focus helps you compete against legacy players.\n\n**But at some point, perhaps within a decade if we're lucky, 51% of new cars will be EVs.**\n\nWe'll be awash in choice. Even in 2022, there are so many more choices for EV buyers compared to three years ago. Things are moving fast.\n\n**Tesla will need to keep innovating faster than the competition.**\n\nIt'll need to keep pushing forward. I doubt a legacy maker will leapfrog Tesla.\n\nIf I was Elon, I'd be watching for new companies wanting to eat my lunch. If I was Elon, I might offer them part of my lunch, so we can partner up. Or so Tesla can buy them.\n\nAs long as Tesla keeps innovating, they have a chance to remain the market leader.\n\nBut if they get comfortable, some new kid's going to eat their lunch.\n\n**When Elon steps down in a few years...**\n\n...I'll be very curious who becomes the new CEO. Perhaps it'll be one of the people from a firm that gets bought out by Tesla."

Tesla's stock price has been pushed up by speculators and trend-chasers. \n\nhalf the comments don't know what they're talking about. this type of thing has happened in the past. read up on the \"growth trap\" concept of prof. Jeremy Siegel. from The Future for Investors (2005):\n\n>The growth trap seduces investors into overpaying for the very firms and industries that drive innovation and spearhead economic expansion. This relentless pursuit of growth\u2014through buying hot stocks, seeking exciting new technologies, or investing in the fastest-growing countries\u2014dooms investors to poor returns. In fact, history shows that many of the best-performing investments are instead found in shrinking industries and in slower-growing countries.\n\nhe goes on to compare IBM (trendy cutting edge tech) and Standard Oil (boring oil company) from the 1950s to 2000. \n\n>\u201cWhy did Standard Oil beat IBM when it fell far short in every growth category? One simple reason: valuation, the price you pay for the earnings and dividends you receive.\n\n>The price investors paid for IBM stock was just too high. Even though the computer giant trumped Standard Oil on growth, Standard Oil trumped IBM on valuation, and **valuation determines investor returns**.\n\nstocks that consistently trade over a p/e of about 50 nearly always go on to underperform the overall stock market. Tesla is practically guaranteed to be disappointing in the future.  \n\ntypo edits."

     "Your example shows exactly what happens when you just look at a PE or income figure without doing any actual research.\n\nYou take Ford's net income from 2021 but forget to back out the one-time income from their Rivian stake ($8.2B). Without it, Ford has a net income of ~$9.7B. On top of that, Ford still needs to start ramping up their EV production, which will heavily reduce their profits to the point of being break-even or even cashflow negative like they were in 2019 and 2020.\n\nTesla in the meanwhile increased their net income from $0.6B to $5.5B from 2020 to 2021. If you annualize their Q1 - which is historically always their least profitable quarter of the year - they're already on a $9.2B runrate (higher than what's expected from Ford). Most experts with a good track record on projecting Tesla expect them to do around the same in net income in Q2 and then significantly more in Q3 and Q4, and believe they might even have a shot at becoming the most profitable automaker on the planet this year at ~$20B. They also seem on a clear path towards becoming more profitable than all other automakers combined by 2024, especially with other OEMs declining significantly right now.\n\nOn top of that, unlike almost every other automaker in the world, Tesla has no risk of bankruptcy thanks to their 0 debt and plenty of cash and positive cash flow.\n\nAnd then they're working on moonshots like robotaxis and Tesla Bot, which would instantly make them the most profitable company in the world if either of these worked out. Even if the market expects the chances of this happening are small, that's something that is taken into account for valuation."

     "A way to think about this is to directly refer to the 'discounted stream of earnings/dividends' model. The value of a stock today is the sum of\n\nearnings this year + earnings next year (lessened by some factor e.g. inflation, the usefulness to you, the range of alternative things to invest in) + earnings the year after (lessened even more). This sums to some value.\n\nNow if you are into growth stocks you believe that the rate of growth will a) be higher than that discount factor, so that each year's return is 'worth increasingly more' b) that it will stay higher than the discount factor for such a long time that you end up making a higher total profit than if you were getting 'jam today' rather than 'jam tomorrow'.\n\nThe key point is that for a value stock, the main contributing terms in the equation of value lies on the left (this year, next year). For a growth stock, the bulk of it lies off to the right, e.g. the terms for years 10, 11, 12 or whatever.\n\nThe problem is that forecasting a) how high growth will be b) how long it will last\n\nThat's super difficult, and small errors in your estimates will absolutely wreck you with a growth stock. Less so with a value stock. Complicating things even more, the discount factor can change over time. We're seeing that right now, with 10y and 30y rates zooming up, inflation zooming up. If you forgot to include the chance of that happening into your equation, well, oops, you just fucked yourself, because suddenly everything on the right side of the equation is getting super-discounted.\n\ne.g. let's say you discounted by 3%. Year 1: 100% of earnings, year 2: 97% of earnings, ... year 10=74% earnings.\n\nnow compare if rates jump to 7%: Year 1: 100% of earnings, years 2: 93% of earnings, years 10= 48%\n\nAs you can see, the value stock, isn't really affected much by the rate change to 7%, so the share price doesn't move much. The numbers for year 1/2/3 are much the same.\n\nWhereas, the growth stock? Wow, the usefulness of earnings in year 10 just dropped by a third! But that's where the bulk of the useful earnings are happening. Therefore, the share price drops by a third as well.\n\nIn reality, the people I've known who buy into growth stocks aren't using discounted views of the future, they're mostly buying into narratives, about the 'idea' of this company being much bigger very soon in the future. Humans find stories very persuasive."

     "It's really hard talking about Tesla because people will very quickly dogpile on with negativity even if they haven't looked at the company at all. It's one of those ones where everyone who is too smart to buy it is pretty bitter as they watch it soar and they are proven wrong over and over.\n\nLook at it this way, today on Yahoo finance Tesla's forward PE is 94.34\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics?p=TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/key-statistics?p=TSLA)\n\nFor a company that grew it's revenues by like 80% in the last year that's incredibly low. Remember Amazon's PE was over 3000 at one point.\n\nAt the moment they're making 1 million cars a year, Elon wants to scale to 20 million cars a year and an equally large battery storage division. This means scaling to about 40x the size they are now, that's a vast amount of growth ahead, that's what people are buying into.\n\nAnother thing to note is that Tesla is a very different company, their goal is to literally be mining raw materials and then selling cars direct to consumers and insuring and servicing them. This is very different from Ford who buy parts from suppliers and have to work with a dealership network which needs a big cut of sales.\n\nThis is leaving out FSD and the Bot which, if they work, and it's a big if, have the potential to be insanely huge.\n\nJust do your own sums, look at Teslas earnings now and then work out what would happen in they scale the company 40x, that's where they plan to go, and it's not guaranteed they will make it, but that's what the bulls are pricing in."

     "Simple: a lot of people are making bets that Tesla will grow into--and beyond--their current valuation.  Even though a lot of the growth/ profits already priced-in (like robo taxis, much larger share of the total car market) are still wildcards.\n\nSome of it is faith in Elon Musk.  Some of it is calculated speculation taking into account Tesla's rapid growth and profit margins.  I suspect most of it is FOMO.  I will say this: most companies do not get valued in this way.  Investors typically want to be rewarded for risk, and with so much of Tesla's future expected success already priced-in they are taking on risk without getting the level of reward that would normally be expected.  It's quite possible that Tesla will grow into and beyond their current valuation.  But right now a lot of that is uncompensated risk, which is not a good strategy for investors."

General Motors, the largest automaker in the US, said [Friday morning](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/01/gm-sales-chip-shortage-suv/5934699001/) that it only sold 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter  a 33 percent drop from the same period last year.\\n\\nTesla has avoided similar problems in part because it has been [sourcing different semiconductors and rewriting software on the fly](https://www.theverge.co'",

     "Tesla is ramping up, navigating around chip shortages, about to start production in 2 brand new factories and the gross margins on each car is a leader in the industry and Tesla is still growing. This latest quarter saw a 73% YoY growth.\n\nIt's been reported that VW's Brandst\u00e4tter and Diess are getting very worried. From the source below:\n\n>Diess stated that compared to Tesla and Chinese manufacturers VW is too expensive, slow and with low productivity not competitive\n\n>Now it is a matter of taking up the \"fight against Gr\u00fcnheide\" Diess said according to BI sources\n\n>If everything remains as it is, Diess insists, VW will no longer be competitive \n\n>Brandst\u00e4tter stated\n\n>'It is urgently necessary that a new course is set in Wolfsburg. Future competition with Tesla's new Gigafactory will be brutal. The electric car pioneer sets new standards in car production. For example, a Model 3 is built in 10 hours, more than 3 times as fast as a VW ID.3 in Zwickau. This puts Tesla in another dimension in terms of productivity and profitability'\n\n>The VW Group CEO concluded\n\n>\"That's why we have to take up the fight, attack and not let Gr\u00fcnheide ruin our location\"\n\n>This is a really alarming and crisis atmosphere at VW HQ and the tone the CEOs used sounds very different from Herbert Diess' tweet today\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alex_avoigt/status/1443993103329857549?s=20"

They spent 2009-2019 building up the supercharger infrastructure at a cost of billions and billions of dollars. It\u2019s a unique advantage. I won\u2019t even get into their factory building technology. Who else can build a giga-factory soup to nuts in a year. They have quality and design issues compared to Porsche but that\u2019s an execution issue. No one else has the portfolio of tech that they do which is why they are worth what they are worth. Keep in mind the single handedly altered the trajectory of this segment of industry. Now everyone is jumping on board."

I begged my parents for some money and they basically said I had to hold onto whatever I bought for at least 1 year rather than day trading.  \n\n\nTurned $5k into $20k by the time I graduated by sitting on NFLX.

How on earth did people think these companies could sustain their insane P/E ratios AND get other investors to buy in (i.e. get them a return) whilst they're on the way to doing it? At best, they'd be able to maintain the peak, but there no way they could just keep climbing. They were priced like startups.\n\nTheir valuations were basically predicated on massive and unfettered growth. To justify them, *everything* was going to have to go right, which was just never going to happen.\n\nI was saying all this about 2 years ago and continuously downvoted for it and accused of 'timing the market'.

     "In a way, it makes sense to me that this would be her new largest holding given that I see a similarity between Roku right now and how Tesla was back when she started buying it years ago. And that similarity is a large percentage of people misunderstanding the company.\n\nFor a long time with Tesla, people would say stuff like \"it is just a car company\" and \"the competition is coming and then it is over for Tesla\". Those people didn't understand Tesla, but as more people started to understand Tesla, the stock experienced tremendous gains.\n\nNow, whenever I see Roku stock get brought up, I see similar kinds of misunderstandings.\n\nMany people misunderstand Roku's business thinking that they are just a hardware seller, but they are much more than that. Roku is selling the shovels to the streaming gold rush. Every streaming service has to give Roku a cut of their subscription revenue just to be on their platform. So, as the overall streaming industry grows bigger which it will, it doesn't matter which individual service is the leader since Roku will be collecting a cut of the revenue from all of them. In addition, Roku has a great ad business, and they collect tons of data about customer preferences across all of the streaming services and that data is very valuable to advertisers. It is also valuable for use internally to help them deliver the content that people want as they grow their own streaming service into yet another source of revenue.\n\nRoku also gets the competition fears with people thinking that Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to hurt Roku. It is like people think that this competition is new. But, in fact; Apple, Google, and Amazon have been competition for Roku for many, many years (Google and Amazon since about 2014, and Apple since 2007 before Roku was even released). Yet Roku continues to beat them in owning the most market share year after year after year with no signs of that changing.\n\nI don't always agree with everything that Cathie buys (I don't believe in her 3rd largest holding for example), but I'm with her on this one. I'm very bullish on Roku at these current prices and I think that it has the potential to be a ten-bagger over the next decade."

They\u2019ve been a total disrupter in the industry by deciding to make \u201cgreen\u201d cars cool instead of just for environmentalists. They have been able to be profitable by making a $35k electric car that has waiting lists. It looks like they\u2019re scaling production \n in a way that will make them very profitable in the future. The biggest reason for me is they seem to be attracting the most talent in the field and I think there is potential for them to not just be a car company, but for them to change the whole transportation industry. \n\n1. You could say that about a lot of industries. So far no company is close to where Tesla is at (IMO) and have aspects that are limiting their innovation. \n\n2. If they can be a major player in transitioning the world to driverless cars and robotaxis I think they could justify their valuation."

It took companies like Amazon and Apple over many years to hit 500b valuation and then magically in 2-3 over 1 trillion. Now above 2 trillion in a shorter timeframe. Prior to this Microsoft was a stock that always sat around 30-60 for many years but just in the last 2 years it went from 800b to 2 trillion in market cap. Microsoft always had high revenue throughout its history.\n\n4) Tesla is not only the starter of electric cars but their experience and technology is ahead of everyone by many years because Tesla has been spending money on R&D for many years on future technology, while the new start ups are worried about building a car and manufacturing for the mass.\n\n5) Traditional car companies transitioning to Electrical cars are hindered by \u201cold thinking\u201d and old branding.

Other auto makers are MILES behind Tesla in that regard. The fact that most still can't get their infotainment right is proof how far Tesla is ahead of them. Not to mention the massive amount of data they have over any other competitors, including company like Google, put them in a comfortable leads in self-driving tech as well.\n\nAnd that's just TWO killer aspects of the company.\n\nTesla also own the charging stations, energy generation and distribution, which each on their own could generated massive growth for years to come as well as protect them from the eventual slowdown of the sale of their vehicles.\n\nCan you imagine Toyota merge with ExxonMobil AND a leader in solar power, and battery? Even then, they don't even have the same synergy like Tesla does.\n\nIf you treat Tesla as a tech company, then the PE make sense. Comparing it to other auto makers is just fundamentally wrong."

Everyone pays for \"future earnings\", so if you think a company will do very well in the future, to figure out how that should affect the stock price you use a formula and calculate what the share price should be based on projected earnings, BAM price is already higher than it should be (price to earnings) just based on this alone.\n3. This is a growth stock. Right now it looks expensive, but if you look at the stock in 10 years it is expected to grow rapidly, for years, especially as we all move towards electric rather than fossil fuel motors. Again, this is taking into account future earnings and market.\n4. They have a huge moat/advantage- name and brand, like apple. There are lots of EV companies, can you name them? I can only think of one off the top of my head. All the other companies are making cars and selling them for reasonable growth/profit, but when I think about investing in those other companies (e.g. canoo) I ask myself, what makes any of those companies special, or more like to survive/profit? Survivor/winner bias. Since Tesla is already \"winning\" everyone feels more confident that they will continue winning, compared to other EV companies.\n5.

     "People who don't believe in Tesla's valuation usually don't research the company very well. They just look at the surface and think \"well other companies will do it too\". However, when you really dive into it, you'll see how far ahead Tesla really is.  \n\n\nThe engineering in their car is at least 5 years ahead of competition and the gap will keep on increasing because of the way the company is set up. Legacy automakers build a car by having different engineering teams build each of their component separately and benchmark performance to other cars. Tesla builds their cars by having all teams work together to build the best car possible. Not only that, their processes ensure that each improvement can be implemented as fast as possible.  \n\n\nJoe Justice did a video about this on youtube, Tesla implements about 27 production changes per week per model. Legacy automakers usually take months or years to approve a single change like this because they have to review each step of the production. An example of the impact of this is Tesla's recent delivery numbers that blew away estimates while every other automaker was cutting production by like 20-40% due to the chip shortage. The reason why Tesla wasn't affected as much is because they're able to use different chips and wrote their own software to ensure compatibility. People might say that eventually other automakers might be able to do this too, but by then Tesla is already going to be focusing on fixing another issue that legacy automakers didn't even think of yet.  \n\n\nAlso, current production of ICE cars is about 100M vehicles per year, 2B cars in the fleet in total. Tesla that is the leader right now produced 500k EVs last year and is about to reach 850k this year. Even if all other automakers were able to catch up to Tesla overnight, there is still an insanely untapped market out there. As costs keep going down, EVs will easily outclass ICE cars from all perspectives. And IMO, legacy automakers are not currently setup to properly profit (yet) from this market without cannibalizing into their own profits (selling less ICE, massive costs of revamping their factories).  \n\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people give a lot of credit to Elon Musk and how he has a cult following, but engineers and other senior management at Tesla are just hella smart people. They deserve way more credit for their insane ingenuity."

They sell higher cost vehicles with higher gross margin which equals a lot higher profit per car. This is mainly due to software sales (FSD) and better manufacturing.\n2. The company is being run more efficiently than competitors which means less operating expenses. In other words - they can keep much more of the money they earn.\n3. They have a lead in technology and have some of the best engineers in the world which results in the gap widening instead of closing.\n\nSo if Tesla sold 6 million cars with 47K ASP and 30 % GM it would equal 84,6 Billion in profit. If 10% of this goes to operating expenses we're down to 76\\~ B profit, which is basically equal to the rest of the car industry combined. \n\nThere are also high expectations for them to out perform the next couple of years (Faster growth than 50% annually which is their target + growing margins).

I am ignoring robotaxi for the moment as it seems to me from the latest shareholder meeting that if they want to licence FSD to other companies, robotaxi is not a priority for the company and they will probably run and milk FSD for many years until it becomes like a commodity so that legislation is not a problem. If licensing FSD seems an absurd idea,people probably don't realize that the competition doesn't have their own tech but mostly outsourced these capabilities to auto suppliers like Continental and others and just integrate it in an Audi, Mercedes, etc it's rarely something fully developed in house."

     "It is difficult to pick stocks right now. Lots of businesses that used to perform well are closing in on capturing the entire potential market and will slow in growth. Just think of facebook, netflix, disney, google, amazon, at some point there just are no additional wealthy people to capture as customers. Lots of other businesses are stagnating due to difficult economic circumstances. Even sectors that should be expanding and making money such as windturbines are doing badly, the giant Vestas even made losses!..  \n\n At this point I personally am unwilling to invest into the broader market. I search for individual stocks that might be reasonable purchases. Just look at for example the german DAX, its near the all time high in a time with record inflation and a very incompetent german government that is hellbent on wrecking germany economically trough regulations, immigration, stangling real estate market with refugee influx and environmental burdens that hamper new construction, bad energy policies, bad demographics (though to be fair thats relevant on a very long time scale and not imminently affecting valuations now). \n\nThe EUR is in a bad position due to the need for rate hikes (that are not coming fast enough at all!) , what can they even do? with southern EU countries in debt, high rates are a big problem, they can not absorb the necessary rate increases. If the rates are not increased the EUR keeps devaluing and taking my savings down with it.\n\nAlso need I remind anyone of the UK? they have food shortages right now. Its unbelievably stupid. We have a lot of risks in the market, risks of wars, risk of too much speculation in the market (excess liquidity), debt risks, war-risks, energy risks etc. At the same time a lot of businesses have accumulated a lot of damages and debt during covid. The rates increase, the damages increase. Growth is therefore much harder to achieve because funding it when you already are in debt, is much harder. I think this means there are sector winners and losers, those who survive with cash on hand/ability to refinance can take away market shares from those who suffered more. \n\nHowever: not investing is also a bad situation. You are guaranteed to lose money that way due to inflation. At least if you own stocks, the companys earnings long term should nominally follow inflation. So even if real earnings do not improve and growth is stunted, at least the nominal numbers increase.   \nBut stocks also compete with bonds again. However bonds at this time can not result in real gains, you still make losses when accounting for inflation. So stocks offer a chance to beat inflation."

Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs. Autonation for example had a random rally in their Q4 earnings despite net income dropping, a conveniently placed share buyback and the company themselves claiming that used cars will be more expensive for them to obtain. They\u2019re now down -16% from that earning report. \n\nThere\u2019s still hard to obtain cars such as hybrids, EVs and enthusiast products but regular petrol models are widely becoming available without having to fight for MSRP."

     "It\u2019s not what we DO here to impress other people socially that matters ultimately. It\u2019s how we socialize and treat other people. Positive minds are always equal to socially. Self worth is love within and showing it off to other people, not DOING stuff to get noticed. \n\nHumor in a mind, when authentic, is about sharing emotions (thoughts, ideas, and beliefs) that honor all people. There is no authority here. Serious minds, or minds that laugh but also look down on other people socially, share ideas and beliefs that are cruel and selfish. \n\nPeople always focus on vibe. We are all connected within non-locally (quantum entanglement). When human beings present a false image socially, which means the outer persona does not match the inner persona, it insults the intelligence and awareness of others. No one likes seeing lying in others about who they are within, when we already FEEL it and know the truth.\n\nWe are all equal socially already. No one is on top, no one is on the bottom, and no one has any worth to prove to anyone. No one is an authority figure here. No one has a free pass to judge people more than others. Ideas rooted in social hierarchy are degrading, humiliating, and stupid.\n\nType A bullies / alphas are not stronger than people that are mellow and friendly socially. Type A / alphas have low feelings of self worth, mental instability, problems with manipulation & dishonesty, and emotional issues. They take their own feelings of self hate and self loathing out on other people socially, unprovoked, for no good reason at all. \n\nQuite often the reasons people judge and cut other individuals down socially without hesitation and incessantly is ONLY because of a competitive nature, not because of a serious threat due to character issues in a person. Cheating in life is knocking people down socially to build up a social life. It\u2019s a bad idea. People see head games in the minds of others. It\u2019s important to be real about this and show honesty socially as much as possible.\n\nWhen people are authentic, they never use career, talent, physical stature / brawn, education, or money as a crutch for self worth socially. There is never a reason to \u201cdominate\u201d others in any area of life when we show or believe in love and friendship. Feelings of self worth come from kindness, honesty, and humility socially, not from social images. Dominators don\u2019t believe in their own personalities or worth. They seek to tear other people down instead.\n\nVery often it\u2019s nice, warm, humble, mature personalities that are already upset and insecure from judgments of the past that are knocked down unfairly even more by status seeking social elitists. People often see gentle human beings as \u201ceasy targets\u201d to look down on so that they can attempt to build up their perceived status in an imaginary social hierarchy. Only conformists and shallow cowards think in these terms, not headstrong men and women with honesty, kindness, and respect. \n\nWhen people are unwilling to pass judgments as much as possible and want to remain friendly, level, and sincere socially, it\u2019s not out of weakness. It makes a human being mentally sharp, emotionally strong, and much more mature socially. It\u2019s a threatening attitude to people that show hatred and jealousy (judgments) socially. \n\nJudgements from status seekers usually have little actual substance or anything to do with character issues, violence in a personality, or antisocial, critical personality issues. Judgments from status seekers are hypocritical, shallow, cruel, and unfair. They ultimately cause violence and war.\n\nNo one cares about showboating or showing off. No one accepts or tolerates authority in other people - it just seems that way on the surface. Everyone is a spiritual being that sees through bullshit. The more conceited the mind, the more dishonesty there is in it.\n\nPeople remain competitive only when they care little about working through their own judgments, anger, and character issues with other people socially. People stay competitive because they are afraid, not because they are happy or calm. Being competitive doesn\u2019t make people \u201cbetter\u201d. It makes people nervous, angry, and depressed. Competitors only feel appreciated for what they look like on the outside and for what they are doing, then attack other people socially because they are in pain over not developing an honest, humble personality.\n\nIt\u2019s time for human beings to wake up and end war and human authority for good. It has no place here. Violence and social elitism is jealousy and anger resulting from the competitive nature of human beings. Human beings that do not believe in love, focus on self worth, have a desire to heal in life, or learn to respect other people socially will always remain competitive, forceful, shallow, dishonest, and aggressive.\n\nAll people appreciate personality, warmth, and humor the most - not what other people DO to show off and impress people socially. That is just being real. Men and women either believe in love, or they do not believe in themselves.\n\nWe are all spiritual beings. We are all psychic. Live the truth and heal self and others socially. It is the only way forward."

On top of that Fremont is hitting new production records, and Giga Texas and Berlin are ramping and will eventually surpass China. They're on track to delivery 500K cars in Q4, at higher ASPs and margins than the 300K in Q1.\n\nOn top of that, with the battery and EV subsidies being added on, as well as the dry battery anode being scaled, they're on track to hit 40-50% gross margins on their cars. Other OEMs are at ~18%. They'll most likely be the most profitable carmaker in the world in 2023, and more profitable than all other carmakers combined in 2024 or 2025.

The rolling stop feature allows vehicles to go through intersections with all-way stop signs at up to 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) per hour.\\n\\nThe recall shows that Tesla programmed its vehicles to violate the law in most states, where police will ticket drivers for disregarding stop signs. The Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices, said it is not aware of any state where a rolling stop is legal.\\n\\nTesla agreed to the recall after two meetings with officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to document'",

This is literally a software update that you can update within a couple of minutes.\n2. This only affects beta FSD users. Has nothing to do with Tesla vehicles in general.\n3. The program only works when the vehicle does not sense any vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclists. The vehicle will only travel 5.6 miles, max. Also, the vehicle in the intersection must also have a stop sign in that intersection and cannot be traveling more than 30 miles on that road. In short, EVERYONE does this.... Every single driver on the road, with or without this beta FSD, driving any car, has done a rolling stop. If you haven't, you're a liar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, this is a non-discussion. No injuries were reported because of this. The only reason it came to light is because Tesla met with the NHTSA to discuss whether they can have this feature on. They determined no so Tesla opted to just remove it.\n\nSorry, legacy automaker investors. But there is nothing to see here."

TSLA;s non car business is also shrinking and Musk has admitted no new models will come out this year because of supply chain shortages and becaue he is focused on other things like a robot and landing men on  Mars.  Musk also tweets a lot of kokky self center nonsense and recently touted a worthless adolf Hitler crypto coin.  Madness and also madness to accept Dogecoin as payment since tht POS isn't worth anything and may not even exist six month from now.\n\nSo what if the fair value of TSLA?  About 70% less.

Also, October is around the corner and well get to see Teslas delivery numbers. The expected wait times has shortened which could indicate a bear case and a bull case the Bear case is that there is a crazy amount of cancellations which have been the result of closing showrooms in China. The bull case is that production in the giga factories have been getting better and they are delivering cars at a much more comfortable pace. Then earnings, expected 10/18-10/24 (not official). Not sure if the currency changes will be such a big factor to the downside. But perhaps deliveries will aid that. \\n\\nAll in all, Im bullish Tesla.

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\\n\\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\\n\\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\\n\\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com\"",

Tesla cars look futuristic. Tesla\u2019s vision aligns well with what I think the future would be. To be fair over-promises are probably more due to design challenge.

     "All trading is risky. \n\nOptions are higher risk higher reward.\n\nWhy? They have a deadline. And the closer they get to it the exponentially worse their value becomes in comparison when trading the value of the contract itself. And if the trade doesn't go in your favour by the deadline you lose 100% of your investment. \n\nBut there are ways to use them that are lower risk too. For example, if I'm entering a trade with shares and decide I'm happy to risk 10% of my investment and put a stop loss there I could have instead took whatever money that 10% loss would have represented and purchased calls with it instead. Or if I buy 100 shares I can lower the risk of the trade by also buying a Put to cap my max loss instead. \n\nIn these scenarios options buy you time instead of time working against you because a stop loss just triggers. Whereas with options you get until expiry for the trade to recover.\n\nThat's barely scratching the surface of greeks and options strategies. \n\nAnd in that lies the main risk. People trading options that don't understand what they are doing, get lucky, get addicted, keep going and then eventually hit a big loss and it's all gone.\n\nLike sure that Tesla trade you provide as an example was a great trade with a decent amount of time given to it and they took profits. But if you're in certain communities you'll see people do trades like that then YOLO the entire thing into a 0 DTE SPY option for a FOMC meeting, get it wrong and goodbye money.

     "Ok I\u2019m an options trader and will clarify some misconceptions here. \n\nLike all asset classes there are riskier strategies and not. Just like stock trading there are riskier stocks and not so risky stocks. I would actually consider a buy and hold strategy of SPY (or any other stock) to be a riskier strategy than the way I trade options. \n\nThe guy bought a call on TSLA out of the money expiring in Sept. The risks are that the stock drops. It may never recover and because of time decay even if it goes back up he may still lose money (or all or most of his investment) if there isn\u2019t enough time left to hit the strike price. An option is priced according to five \u201cGreeks\u201d. Delta, theta, gamma, Vega and rho. You should have a good grasp of the Greeks before touching options. \n\nMost people who invest in stocks look for one way to profit. The stock needs to go up. (Or you can short but I gather most people don\u2019t short stocks as it\u2019s more complicated.) As a net short options trader I can profit in any market environment, bearish, slightly bearish, neutral, bullish or extremely bullish. I have strategies I can employ for whatever market environment. I also can limit my max loss on any one trade and believe it or not reduce volatility and risk as compared to a simple buy and hold strategy. I control probability of success and amount of profit and loss. There are trade offs for each of course but you just need to know what you\u2019re doing and appropriately size your positions and trades. \n\nSo the bottom line is it isn\u2019t that \u201coptions trading is risky\u201d. It\u2019s how it\u2019s employed. For example investors in SVB who have all of their money in one stock would\u2019ve lost all of their investment employing a buy and hold strategy. Similarly the investor who shorted puts would\u2019ve had their whole account wiped out and then some  if they over leveraged. The issue isn\u2019t so much with options trading as it is with position sizing. That is what gets people into trouble. \n\nThe OP thinks that this is free or easy money. Nothing is free or easy. Everything has trade offs. As a successful options trader I don\u2019t worry about how much I can make. I worry about how much I can lose. And I size my position and max loss potential to reflect that. In my years of trading stocks and options I can tell you that being a net short options trader gives you a far higher risk adjusted return than a simply indexing strategy."

The companies don't have to publicize the work these teams do because the primary focus of these companies is the production and delivery of cars, which they do far better than Tesla. Tesla has to focus on FSD because tech is their value proposition, not delivering cars. Judging by Musk's own admission the self-driving tech needs to be improved 5x-10x to be usable in a commercial sense, which means we are probably a decade or two away from it being on the streets, at which time Tesla will likely be mostly out of the auto business and auto manufacturers will have their solutions on the road."

     "Tons of misinformation going on here. \n\n1. This was Tesla's decision. The reason Tesla pulled the application is because they knew they would no longer qualify. Germany's spokeperson for the Economy Ministry said as much.\n2. The offer was that Tesla had to manufacture their 4680 cells at their Berlin factory first. Meaning, this Berlin factory had dibs. The subsidies were offered because Germany wanted to rely less on imports and turn Germany into the EV-central of Europe. If you've been paying attention to the development of their factory, the Berlin factory has been taking longer than they would like because of government approval. They are STILL waiting to be approved before they can start production. Meanwhile, their Texas factory is also capable and further along the process to produce these batteries. My guess? Tesla had planned to start their 4680 battery production in Berlin, it took longer than expected, and so Tesla is moving on with it in their Tesla factory. \n3. I don't work for Tesla nor do I have insider knowledge but there are people who make these decisions internally who have the data and skills to weigh the pros/cons. Right now, it seems Tesla believes the delay in this Berlin factory is not worth putting their 4680 battery production to a halt. This 'delay' is worth more to them than the $1.3 billion subsidy.\n4. \u201cIt has always been Tesla\u2019s view that all subsidies should be eliminated, ***but that must include the massive subsidies for oil & gas,\u201d*** Musk tweeted after the ministry\u2019s announcement. ***\u201cFor some reason, governments don\u2019t want to do that \u2026\u201d***  \nElon never stated that Tesla wouldn't take subsidies. He stated that they don't believe in subsidies but currently, the oil/gas giants being lobbied receive hundreds of billions in subsidies. It wouldn't be economically feasible for an EV maker to exist without these subsidies. Take for example, Norway. EV's are more affordable than ICE vehicles because of subsidies. If not, the adoption of EV's would take much longer. Remove subsidies for the oil/gas industry and the cost of owning an ICE would increase, rapidly. We all know why they won't do that... because the oil/gas industry is one of the most heavily lobbied industries with ties to politicians across governments."

     "In a way, it makes sense to me that this would be her new largest holding given that I see a similarity between Roku right now and how Tesla was back when she started buying it years ago. And that similarity is a large percentage of people misunderstanding the company.\r  \n\r  \nFor a long time with Tesla, people would say stuff like \"it is just a car company\" and \"the competition is coming and then it is over for Tesla\". Those people didn't understand Tesla, but as more people started to understand Tesla, the stock experienced tremendous gains.\r  \n\r  \nNow, whenever I see Roku stock get brought up, I see similar kinds of misunderstandings.\r  \n\r  \nMany people misunderstand Roku's business thinking that they are just a hardware seller, but they are much more than that. Roku is selling the shovels to the streaming gold rush. Every streaming service has to give Roku a cut of their subscription revenue just to be on their platform. So, as the overall streaming industry grows bigger which it will, it doesn't matter which individual service is the leader since Roku will be collecting a cut of the revenue from all of them. In addition, Roku has a great ad business, and they collect tons of data about customer preferences across all of the streaming services and that data is very valuable to advertisers. It is also valuable for use internally to help them deliver the content that people want as they grow their own streaming service into yet another source of revenue.\r  \n\r  \nRoku also gets the competition fears with people thinking that Apple, Google, and Amazon are going to hurt Roku. It is like people think that this competition is new. But, in fact; Apple, Google, and Amazon have been competition for Roku for many, many years (Google and Amazon since about 2014, and Apple since 2007 before Roku was even released). Yet Roku continues to beat them in owning the most market share year after year after year with no signs of that changing.\r  \n\r  \nI don't always agree with everything that Cathie buys (I don't believe in her 3rd largest holding for example), but I'm with her on this one. I'm very bullish on Roku at these current prices and I think that it has the potential to be a ten-bagger over the next decade."

     "What's really surprising about this is how poorly every other automaker is doing. It would seem like someone would be able to do good margins and good volume and be a profitable company. Or failing that at least be consistent and steady and unleveraged on average.\n\nBut the global auto market looks like it's cut throat, with tiny margins, and is barely scrapping by in the periods between one crisis and the next crisis. There's some brands that can charge good margins, but they have real problems scaling that up. The most reliable segment for long term profits over the last couple decades has been luxury SUVs, but even there over investing in that segment caused serious problems for major players when there was an economic downturn and consumer preferences shifted in the short term.\n\nAt first glance, it would seem like EVs are a godsend for the incumbents, they get to sell a whole new kind of car to all their existing customers. And would hopefully be able to get some subsidies to do it, or at the very least get out from underneath increasingly stringent emissions regulations. \n\nBut basically no major incumbent is embracing EVs as an answer to their long term problems. For a long time they barely made any, just enough to meet minimum compliance needs. And even now they're not investing nearly enough to capture decent market share, while still relying heavily on segments that are going to be problematic long term (mostly SUVs).\n\nAnd when you dig in to their balance sheets, it starts to make sense. They make a huge amount of money selling parts for the existing fleet of installed vehicles. If they push out new cars, that are much less complicated and much more reliable, to replace the aging installed base, their parts sales profits are going to disappear. It will be incredibly hard to fund a transition to new products if they're losing short term profits from high margin vehicles, and also cutting off a steady supply of long term profits from parts. The only real option is to dive in completely and commit to the new market, and it doesn't seem like anyone is willing to make that jump?\n\nPart of the issue might be that most automakers also rely on financing to make money. They're basically banks that also sell cars, and I'm sure that creates a very difficult management structure, especially if you need to convince everyone to make a huge commitment to new a new engineering and manufacturing model.\n\nIt's kind of like how [airlines basically became banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4) and rely on loyalty programs to make any real profit. It creates a really perverse structure for anyone that's trying to make big changes to the \"core\" (or what should be the core) business."

     "So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.\n\nThe truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?\n\nThe answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.\n\nIn the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.\n\nWhich brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.\n\nIn 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s..."

The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play."

Their capital will be quite costly in this interest rate environment so at this point, I'm not sure how they can deliver above market returns. But I'm sticking with it because I'm already in the green since I bought post-dividend cut and perhaps they will surprise us with something strategically special. If not, I'll just keep collecting the half-decent divvy and hope for slow gains.\n\nBrookfield has a narrow but solid strategy. They have a decent asset growth plan and have access to relatively cheap capital through Brookfield parent. They know how to manage merchant power assets and with the knowledge they are building on the renewable side, I think they will provide decent long term returns (but no crazy beta) over other merchant generators.\n\nI'm also in MSFT and AMZN but don't have any special insights/theses that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere."

Not only do we have instant access to information, but we also have instant access to discussions regarding that information.

The biggest problem I have with this is that many will dismiss Tesla as a bubble and overvalued without digging into the company themselves. \\n\\nI want to make one thing clear with my post: Im not saying that you cant be bearish on Tesla.

     "What most people don't get about Tesla is actually really simple in my opinion.\n\nWhen Tesla sells a car, it's not the same as Ford or GM selling a car (whether that is ICE or an EV).\n\nSo when you say Ford sells 5,000,000 cars and Tesla only sells 900,000 how can it be worth 10x more?\n\nActually pretty simple.\n\nTesla makes a hell of a lot more profit than Ford when they sell a car.\n\nYou only need to look at the most recent financial statement to see this being true. Ford has an operating margin of 3.76% vs Tesla which has 14.56%.\n\nWait till Q4 it's only going up. For Tesla, they haven't even managed to benefit from true economies of scale like the other OEMs have. \n\nSee when Tesla sells more and more cars, they not only make more revenue, they will actually make more contributing margin as well. \n\nAll the while eating into the other competitor's 'car' market share. This is a zero sum game.\n\n**That's the key difference**.\n\nSo ask yourself what happens when Tesla sells 5,000,000 cars? Heck, 20,000,000 cars is what they are going for.\n\nThen you might think that Ford and all the others will be able to catch up and suppress the operating margin.\n\nWell, not so quick.\n\nIs Ford going to stop marketing and advertising costs, like Tesla?\n\nAre they going to be deeply vertically integrated, like Tesla?\n\nWill they be able to sell just online and not through dealerships?\n\nDo they plan on building out the same charging infrastructure and charging other brands for using it as well?\n\nDo they plan on selling $12k software?\n\nHow do they get the battery cost advantage?\n\n[https://twitter.com/p\\_ferragu/status/1395756307081203719/photo/1](https://twitter.com/p_ferragu/status/1395756307081203719/photo/1)\n\nAll these things add up into an Apple iPhone moment. Where although Tesla market share might get hampered (like the iPhone) they will retain the vast majority of the profits.\n\nTesla is the next Apple, except instead of selling $1000 products, they are selling $50,000 products and instead of Apple Music etc. It's FSD.\n\nThis is not financial advice."

You can now watch movies, study, play games, and even trade stocks while traveling like on a train. \n\nIt\u2019s the future man I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll look exactly how we think, but the autonomy *is* the value to me."

     "Also, please don\u2019t sleep on Tesla AI.\n\nYes, I\u2019m aware this is in some ways a moonshot within a moonshot (Tesla AI starts with FSD) but look at what they are doing. Not only do they have their own designed inference computer with their own chip design. They have their own C compilers and data formats. They have their own fully custom training computer with a revolutionary custom chip design. \n\nThis is rivaling companies like Nvidia, but kept internally at Tesla (for now) and thus without the need to stay compatible with any customers. Tesla Dojo is an extremely specialized AI training system.\n\nFeel free to cue x-files theme music here, but (especially combined with Elons ventures with OpenAI and the pushbacks experienced there etc) this is Tesla taking the first steps towards the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\n\nStarting with a car that understand the surrounding world and navigates through it, continuing with a humanoid robot that uses the learnings from that to navigate the same environment. Use that to enable the humanoid robot to replace certain basic human tasks and carry on to more advanced tasks etc and eventually (likely many decades from now) replace anything a human can do and more.\n\nIt\u2019s the moon shot of all moon shots, but even if the ultimate goal of AGI is never achieved there is sure to be a shit ton of revenue-creating opportunities spawned on the journey.\n\nAnd like OP said, even if none of this happens and everything mentioned in this comment explodes in a giant dumpster fire, the all you\u2019re stuck with is a really good company disrupting car manufacturing and sales."

     "I do not have a horse in this race. No shares or intention to buy any. However the automotive industry is my job working product support for a large German brand. Also have friends that work for Tesla (in the UK) so have done quite a lot of digging into there cars for personal curiosity and to see how they compare with our product. \nI like the look of them and the range specs are great from what I can see Teslas are a far from being the best car on market. This is not referring to their EV tech which is decent but the car as a whole and build quality. Small things that other brands do not suffer with such as panel gapping issues, wind noises, rattles, wiring problems. \n\nThats not to say all these things can not be easily fixed and probably will be in time but to me does not scream quality. I think a lot also discount what other brands are doing, they are hot on the tail not just with Bevs they currently have but what they have planned, behind the scenes that nobody sees. Over the next few years the more and more Bevs will hit the market and the choice of budget and high end EVs will be a plenty. \n\nAgain I have no issue with Tesla, in general like their cars but not blown away. They will continue to sell cars for years to come but will not dominate the market by any means."

Like the OP says, there indeed is a huge growth potential *even if Tesla\u2019s market share declines*. But if your assumption is that the EV economy will be about the same size as the current combustion engine economy and not significantly larger, *not even a 100% market share would justify Tesla current valuation*. And I think the OP\u2018s assumption that Tesla won\u2018t come close to 100% is absolutely correct. So something else has to give. And as far as I can see, that something can only be a massive rise in the EV economy size, perhaps by no less than an order of magnitude. But even with sector coupling and Tesla (and other OEMs) becoming a player in the power system of the future by expanding into smart grid and smart homes, I can\u2018t see that happening. Actually, there\u2018s reason to believe individual motorised mobility as a sector might decline over the next decades, since most rich-country governments will try to enhance public transport, and young people and (the growing number of) city dwellers are buying less and less cars.\n\nedit: some styling"

     "I think there are several reasons to it.\n\n1. Moat. Amazon has a well-established moat in several of its core businesses. Tesla is said by some to have one of the strongest moats ever: data, software and hardware for FSD. This will give them a massive edge in the FSD segment which is huge. Others say they have no moat and their millions of miles of data is rivalled very well by billions of virtually driven miles; their software and NPUs are rivalled by e.g. NVDA's DRIVE suit. For Amazon, there is no real debate on whether they will dominate their given business segments.\n2. History. Amazon has arguably a longer history as a company which has gone through several boom-bust cycles, hence they have \"proven\" they are able to navigate rough waters. History is extremely important in the stock market and a long-lasting company with a stable management is worth a lot. And then you have Elon Musk.\n3. China. Tesla sold 1/3 of their cars in China (of the last quarter). China is the biggest car market in the world and its plans to include EVs into their everyday life are set in stone (5-year plans). It is, however, a little risky to have such huge business in China nowadays. On the contrary, it is a big benefit to have revenue streams in different currencies and be diversified geographically; not only does it increase the TAM you can capture but it also helps vs currency devaluations. Amazons business is concentrated to US and EU mostly. Highly regulated markets, which is a benefit also.\n4. Debt interest. This is related to many other indicators and shows how \"trusted\" corporations are by big banks. Amazon's effective interest rate (latest twelve months) is \\~1.4%, for Tesla it is more than double that with \\~3.3%. Hence, Amazon is not only able to refinance debt for lower levels, the market is trusting Amazon more than Tesla if it comes to lending money. If you want to compare two companies, first thing to do is compare the interest they pay on the debt they issue. According to this, the valuation must be higher for Amazon, because they are less likely to default.In other words, Tesla incorporates much higher levels of risk into your portfolio than Amazon, even though you pay roughly the same for their earnings. From a risk-perspective, Tesla is the worse deal here.\n\nOfc there are many reasons besides the metrics you and I discuss here that are important. I should clarify that I own shares of both companies."

Which leads to...\n\nThird, you're saying because they only have 1% of the auto market, their future growth prospects are bigger, but many analysts are saying that Tesla is starting face much higher competition in the EV market. Some are better cars at lower prices without a 6-12 month wait.\n\nVW, Ford, Audi, Kia and Hyundai are putting out some great EVs now. Even Musk has acknowledged Hyundai's progress on the market.\n\nTheir future growth always depended on going beyond cars. Their market cap wouldn't be justifiable if they are just a car company. Self-insurance of their cars, autopilot tech (which seems to be failing), and information gathering, battery tech, charger network, are areas they need to grow and monetize."

     "Quite a few things to unpack here:\n\n> So what other company and stock can we compare that is as at the same size as Tesla with very high growth prospects and is widely considered a good business AND a good investment? Amazon!\n\nThese are in completely different industries, with different characteristics, capital requirements etc. It makes zero sense to compare them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So to sum it up, Tesla is actually less richly valued than Amazon based on current and 2023 earnings multiples, the analysts have consistently underestimated Tesla despite revising earnings estimates up while analysts have consistently overestimated Amazon despite revising earning estimates down, and Tesla earnings are more certain than Amazon's. As a reminder, Tesla has much more room to grow with only 1.5% of the car market compared to Amazon's 40% share of online retail.\n\nTesla's estimation if you look at them use a high multiple growth combined with the same margin as it has now. Given that the cheapest Tesla is 46k, there is a limit to how far you can grow (which would be around 2-3m cars for Tesla with their current lineup). Additionally while Tesla does have room to grow, they are valued as though they would have 10m sold cars with twice the margin, ASP and valuation as Toyota. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Based on my own estimate, I believe Tesla will actually accomplish 2023 earnings of $23.81 per share (compare to analyst consensus of $14.51) by expanding revenue over 50% in 2023 with new factories ramped up in Berlin and Austin, gross margins well in excess of 30% due to economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies at their new factories as well as near 100% margin software sales, while operating expenses grow slower than revenue growth. I\n\nWhy do you think they will grow by 50%. Berlin and Austins have problems ramping up. Gross Margins (which are meaningless in car manufracturing due to the labor cost) will go lower as most commodities have increased significantly. Furthmore, the Tesla Model 3's growth profile is slowing by a significant margin in the last quarter. I think it is actually more likely for Tesla to have no growth in 2023, than to have 50% given their struggles with the factory ramp ups outside of China. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In other words, the trend of analysts underestimating Tesla combined with Tesla's relatively reasonable valuation multiple (as discussed above) could provide a tailwind to the stock over the next 12-16 months and take it to new highs.\n\nTesla's valuation looks reasonable, but are not if you include the costs that are associated with being a car manufacturer. Given the headwinds of the economy, inflation (rents and food are still rising), an aging line-up without any refreshes and the FED hiking interest rates (making car loans more expensive), I don't think that Tesla will grow in 2023. \n\nI also think that Tesla is similar to Cisco. A great company, that was just too promising. Here is my prediction. Tesla will not see ATH for the next decade."

A lot US stocks are flat / down despite the run up in USD terms since the USD has weakened quite a lot over the past few months.\n\nAs a EUR investor, the only thing that\u2019s really ballooned again is tech when factoring in FX rates movements, and it seems to more based of potential changes in interest rate policy rather than fundamentals, because the fundamentals (both individual company & macro) aren\u2019t trending amazingly well. My personal view is certain parts of the tech sector: APPL, MSFT etc\u2026have taken in a lot of sideline cash in anticipation of rate pauses (or even cuts) and are currently overvalued. Great companies but not at a fair price. I had a big bag of MSFT, sold 60% this week.

     "Lots of differences to consider here, but at the end of the day whether one or the other is overvalued or undervalued really depends on your projections. Personally I like AMZN, but I don't like TSLA, so let me try to explain why...\n\nArguably AMZN's revs are higher quality because the segment that makes all the money (AWS) is recurring, business essential and operating in a sector of the economy with secular growth tailwinds. TSLA's revs on the other hand aren't recurring, largely tied to consumer health and vehicle sales trends and not in a sector with similar secular growth tailwinds (personal vehicle sales). You could argue EVs have growth tailwinds which I agree with, but in years to come when all automobiles sold are EV that distinction will disappear and then TSLA will just be a regular car company like all the others.\n\nI think many investors would also argue that AMZN has significant room for margin expansion and that today's earnings don't fairly represent AMZN's earning potential. TSLA however already has sector-leading margins and those will almost certainly come under pressure with increased competition.\n\nMy issue with TSLA's valuation is that unlike tech the automobile industry has always been a very competitive place to operate and the consumer is highly segmented. You can't expect TSLA to dominate the automobile industry in the same way we might expect AMZN to dominate ecommerce and cloud services. TSLA's brand isn't going to appeal to every demographic and TSLA isn't going to capture a disproportionately large percentage of the market.\n\nBut if you don't think TSLA is going to face significant competition then it's probably a good buy honestly, but that's not because of the growth potential, but because of the margins. The reason big tech can sustain such large valuations isn't their revs, but their insanely high margins which are due to a lack of competition. Toyota has similar revs to GOOG for example but their valuation is no where near GOOG's because they can't demand the same margins. This is the fundamental risk with TSLA and why I don't care about growth projections. If TSLA is fairly valued it will have much more to do with competition and margins. I worry about both."

Given the current growth rates Tesla won't hit that 50% annual growth, and the more cars they make the harder it will get. \n\nAdditionally their car lineup is aging rapidly and the growth rates currently are very similar to that of the S a few years ago. Chances are high, that unless they introduce a new refresh that they growth will stall at around 2m cars -  making them overall overvalued."

They spent a crazy percent of earnings trying to either get ahead in existing industries or expand into new ones. Now consider tesla, who has excellent pricing power, revenue growth and innovative edge on things like self-driving tech. VW and other legacy car manufacturers are expanding into the EV space. VW in particular seems like a candidate to eat into tesla\u2019s EV market dominance. VW is aggressively ramping up EV production and has more than 4X the revenue of tesla. I think tesla will remain in the lead for EVs but will lose some dominance in the next few years. Tesla\u2019s PE is currently 20X higher than VW, so im more optimistic on amazon over tesla."

However, getting \u201ccrushed\u201d with blue chip stock usually looks like capping your gain and selling CSEPs until it corrects back down, which could be next week, I could be never\u2026"

     "Tesla is not the first mover of EVs. It's just the most popular and overhyped one. The Tesla Hype will EVENTUALLY die down. But I cannot really predict when. It might reach 100 trillion (random number generator) market cap before that, who knows? But, if it's a market that anyone can get in, and there are already a huge bunch of players in it then competition will be strong. Unlike Netflix that created a market on its own, Tesla is just trying to enter an existing market with something new and different. VW group, Toyota group and others that are already in the group, will just switch to electric (or Hydrogen Fuel cells which probably is more environmentally friendly ) and capitalize on user loyalty For example I personally am not buying any car that is not Toyota. I own a Toyota Corrola from 2006. Quite often I forget to change the engine oil, neglect taking it for service and maintenance, take it off road, to mountains, to gravel, to rocks, hit it a few times here and there, scratches everywhere, and I it has 300 000 km on it.\n\nThe service cost is around 100 euros, which I'm supposed to do every 10k km but I usually go at 15k because I forget. Other brands cars would have been dead by now (my friends all switched cars because their previous ones died) or the service cost will be triple, or both (friend of mine, owns a golf, bought it 3 years ago, does the same amount of km as me per year, but obviously a lot less in total, and so far has paid around 10k euros in repairs).\n\nSo yeah, Tesla might be the \"first\" but it will not be alone, it's not even alone now. Netflix started something new, it was alone and capitalized on that. Tesla is just Elon Musk hype.\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\* When I said Hydrogen cars, I meant Hydrogen Fuel cells which still an EV but does not have the environmental impact of disposing batteries when they are done.  \nhttps://ams-composites.com/hydrogen-fuel-cell-vs-lithium-ion-the-future-of-transport/#:\\~:text=Hydrogen%20fuel%20cells%20have%20an,greater%20than%20lithium%2Dion%20batteries.&text=In%20addition%2C%20whereas%20lithium%20batteries,degrade%20in%20the%20same%20way."

Disney will do well in the streaming space, but they're not just going to compete Netflix out of the market, and legacy automakers are most certainly not going to compete Tesla out of the market. So far, none of the legacy automakers have shown to be capable of converting their production to EVs fast enough, let alone keeping up with Tesla's rate of innovation.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that you suggested Toyota makes the whole question even more ridiculous. Toyota is one of the few legacy automakers who's actively working AGAINST the transition to EVs and hardly making the transition themselves. Their target is to sell 1 million EVs by 2030, which means they'll sell at most 1/10th the cars per year they do today. Their automotive branch will no longer exist or be just a ghost of their former self in 10-15 years.\n\nThe future of EVs (and cars in general) will be largely be Tesla and a bunch of Chinese brands, with maybe about 20-30% left for brands like Mercedes, VW and some Korean/Japenese brands that are not Toyota."

That silent majority is wondering whether EVs are really OK to have as a single option. But they think its the trend so'",

As someone who is frugal, I don't like the idea of buying a car, then after 5 years (talking out of my ass here, because after 5 years, full charge of phone last me 2 hours, instead of a full day) I have to fork out tremendous amount of money to get new batteries when the car itself is still usable (or would they do it like phone ?

     "He's right. Pursuing EV only might be a viable solution for some European and North American countries because they have the infrastructure and light enough population density to pull it off. For those countries they can go ahead and set their sights on an all electric future, but that strategy is no where near realistic or feasible in other markets. \n\nToyota's sales figures are gigantic in South and East Asian countries like China, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Indonesia where you have a rising Middle class that is able to afford family cars for the first time in greater numbers. You also have huge population centers where people tend to live in high rise apartment buildings so charging at home isn't an option and providing enough public charging stations for everyone to charge even an hour a day is practically impossible. \n\nFor those markets efficient hydrocarbon and hybrid is the only viable solution for the foreseeable future. Pretending that all electric in 20 or 30 years should be a universal goal is a fool's errand.  \n\nWhat GM, VW and others are doing by declaring all electric lineups is essentially killing their share in these emerging markets in the near future. The Japanese manufacturers on the other hand, are taking the more pragmatic approach."

     "It\u2019s really astonishing looking at the comments on this thread. I mean we are still in r/stocks right ? A place were investors should be a bit more savvy. \n\n1) Being first does not mean you will be the only one or the best in what you do. At this point yes Microsoft came first but we have no clue what Google or even Apple or Meta is planning. MSFT seems to be winning for now until the next player launches something in the search space which could be even bigger or better than what MSFT did. Remember the most notable examples in this are Facebook and Google who both dethroned their competitors almost overnight and they were not even the big companies they are now. \n\n\n2) It\u2019s not about the idea but the execution. And I cannot stress that enough. Say Google comes back with a much better AI, returns much better results, has found a smart way to monetize it and is years ahead of OpenAI in terms of engineering. Unless they find a nice way to present it and market it to customers they are doomed to fail. Launching a product is not just about the engineering of the product. There is so much more to it. From marketing to business model to public perception to privacy to customer support and to the product itself of course. Remember Google waves ? An internal tool Google used, much like slack-before slack to communicate? They launched it to public but figured their UX and product execution sucked so they killed it. Later on slack came along and showed them that they had the right idea but the execution was poor.  Do I also need to remind you Betamax vs VHS? One was an engineer marvel the other just had better partnerships and was ticking more boxes for the users. \n\n3) Google is never going all-in in a product. So far Google is known for killing projects if they see they cannot monetize in the short term. Google\u2019s product cemetery is quite huge . They still work like a VC betting on 100 products to get 1 right so their successful product/cemetery ratio is not that promising. \n\n\nAll in all, we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end but it\u2019s really weird looking comments like Google has already something or MSFT was there first. No Google does not have anything unless they decide to launch a proper product to the market and find a better product-market fit than the competition.  And yes  MSFT was there first but that does not mean anything as Google might have a very strong comeback. It all depends on each company\u2019s ability to launch a product and not just the product itself"

It\u2019s probably either coming starting with the Fed this week (as much as I HATE this because it\u2019s simply way too simple), or we probably wind up managing to tag the 4300\u2019s, then reverse around Feb OPEX\u2026but to me at the very least, the secular/long-term bear-nista believer is going to be greatly disappointed unless the S&P loses the March 2021 local lows again."

This is market share and when the profits start this stock is going through the roof\u201d.  So I wanted to use my 401k and talked about buying 10s of thousands (dollars). but my acct was only set up for mutual funds.  I went down to the woman who is in charge of this stuff for our company...she was nasty. Gave me a bunch of shit. I walked out saying \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll just call the xx401kxx company\u201d.  I never did.   We archive our chat client and years later I searched and found the chat versions of the conversation where I said I was going to buy at $110 or something \n * TSLA:  have some fancy people in my work.  Company put chargers in.  The Tesla\u2019s start appearing. A LOT.  Could see the chargers and Teslas from the windows where my team worked and we talked about them all the time.  We literally watched the growth of the company.  Never bought \n\nI did buy 3 bitcoin at $400 each and sold @ $11,000 (sold while sitting on the toilet in bathroom stall).  I get that it\u2019s much higher now but I am ok with 2500% returns in 2 or 3 years\n\nEDIT: What I DID buy was a large cap growth mutual fund.

Gigafactory Berlin, a critical new factory for Teslas plans to expand in Europe and improve its manufacturing and distribution efficiency, has been in limbo for months.\\n\\nThe automaker has yet to secure the needed environmental permit to start producing vehicles for customer deliveries. Last month, Tesla confirmed that it built the first few Model Ys at Gigafactory Berlin at the end of 2021.\\n\\nThe automaker also received approval to build 2,000 Model Y bodies at Gigafactory Berlin ahead of the final approval by the state of Brandenburg. Tesla said it needed to conduct more tests of its production process, and it hasnt been approved to deliver those vehicles. However, it looks like the factory is up and running with hundreds of new Model Y vehicles spotted coming out of the factory last week.\\n\\n[https://electrek.co/2022/02/28/tesla-gigafactory-berlin-exp'",

     "If you're gonna buy it based on some Reddit comments, you're just gonna make the same mistake and sell out at the wrong time again.\n\nIf you want to know if you should own the stock, do your own projections. Personally, I would focus on two things with Tesla: automotive and FSD.\n\n**Automotive**\n\nFor automotive, I would go the traditional route and look at revenue, earnings and a PE value. If you annualize Q3, Tesla is at a PE of 190. In 2021 and 2022 I expect them to grow around 80% in unit sales, revenue by 70%. In terms of net income, I expect 1,100% in 2021 and at least another 100% in 2022. If this indeed happens, they'd be at a trailing PE of 52 by the end of 2022, which makes them a screaming buy in my eyes.\n\nBut perhaps your numbers are different, so do your own projections and make your own thesis.\n\n**FSD**\n\nFor FSD, I would go through the following metrics to create your own projection:\n\n* How many cars will they sell roughly each year throughout this decade?\n* Add those together, add 1 million cars that are already sold, and multiple that by .9 to get total cars on the road in 2030 (roughly 5-10% of cars will be taken out of commission before then).\n* Estimate the FSD subscription cost per month in 2030. Currently it's $200, Elon has already said FSD price will increase significantly in the future, supposedly this goes for both subscription and full purchases.\n* Estimate the FSD take rate. Currently it's around 10% in the US, where it works best. Obviously this will go up significantly if your car could fully drive itself and earn you money by serving as a robotaxi.\n* Multiply total vehicles on the road by FSD take rate and multiple that by monthly subscription price to get revenue per month.\n* Multiply that by 12 to get FSD revenue per year.\n* Estimate the expected margin percentage. This is a software service, so probably somewhere between 70 and 90%.\n* Multiply yearly FSD revenue by the margin percentage to get the operating income.\n* Multiply that by 0.8 to get a rough estimation of Net Income per year.\n* Estimate what you think Tesla's PE ratio will be by 2030. Lower than 20 is unrealistic, higher than 90 probably is too.\n* Multiply the annual net income by the PE multiple to get Tesla's market cap by 2030.\n\nWhen you've done all that, put % on the chance you think Tesla has of solving full autonomy this decade, to determine how likely you think that valuation is to come true. No matter which numbers I use, I believe Tesla is a clear buy if they solve FSD this decade, but perhaps you come to a different conclusion.\n\n**The rest**\n\nFinally, there's everything else... Supercharger revenue, solar/energy sales, energy software revenue (autobidder), AI, HVAC, and any new products/services Tesla is yet to release. All of these are too difficult to project right now in my opinion, and they're just a bonus to Tesla's market cap that could range from a negligible part to a significant part of their business in 10 years' time."

I don\u2019t usually touch a stock during a run up like this, let it run is all I do if there is a pullback I add but what is a reasonable pullback for Tesla?  Will it continue to run up to 1000?"

I believe that they have unseen value due to their assembly line improvements and the brand itself. I'd love a Tesla, don't care much for other EVs. I'm sure more would agree with that than disagree. (I also like gm, but it's more of a value reason than a EV hot take.)\n\nWhen you look at this companies valuation, it doesn't make sense. But the management is extremely intelligent and continues to innovate. Also, the p/e has almost cut in half, that doesn't make it cheap, but it makes it the cheapest it's been in a while. I think this rally will last. I bought calls for earnings and made out well, but even though I think it could keep rolling, I sold all my options and put the profit into shares, which I view as safer.\n\nI plan on going long.

The other auto manufacturers have had 6 years to come up with a meaningful competitor to the model 3, and the closest they've got are the Chevy Bolt (sucks) and Porsche Taycan (way too expensive). If that's the best the competitors have managed to do in 6 years, I'm starting to give up on them. As long as Tesla doesn't drop the ball, by the time the other competitors \"catch up\", Tesla should be comfortably another 10 years ahead of them.\n\nI know making cars is hard.

It will even take longer because IC engine is more efficient than ever. \n\nAnother consideration is high cost of Lithium and limited availability. There are just 14M tonnes mines discovered on earth making \\~200M eV cars. We have 1,400M vehicles on earth. The cost of raw material has quaded in 1 year at $40,000 a tonne in early 2022. Its price was 1/10 ten years ago. Li cost will reach $54,000 later this year.  Tesla consumed $19K tonnes of Li 4 years ago. The process of refining Li has not got caught up with strong demand. That goes for lithiunm.  There are also nickel, manganese, cobalt and graphite involved. Each raw material, extraction, and sourcing can be a momumental challenge."

Its just a matter of who can get supplies to make them and how fast they can get them to a customer.\n\nIn other words you cannot conclude anything from current environment. Even my brother ended up buying a Tesla only because it was the only thing available. He wanted a Mach-E but the wait is likely over a year. He did order a Lightning in the 2nd wave but he probably wont see that till year end. He is hoping to just sell the Tesla once the truck arrives.\n\nTold him this is a horrible idea and to wait but he has cash to burn so he just went for it since the Tesla was ready now and his car was on its last leg.\n\nI will say however, he is very unhappy with his Model-Y. Aside from being electric and fast charging, it feels very cheap. The interior is cheesy, the seats are not comfortable, the AC circulation sucks and the self driving is absolutely worthless. Literally there is no point to it at all except maybe self parking for someone who doesnt know how to park a car...\n\nBut worst of all, he had it about 3 weeks when there was some sort of recall and the car has been in the shop for 4 weeks since... its literally been in the shop longer than he had possession and what did they give him as a loaner? A tiny M3... He is not happy at all and they keep pushing back the return date due to supply problems. He has already talked to a lawyer though was told there is nothing they can do yet.\n\nAll anecdotal of course, but I used it too and was underwhelmed as well. The interior is indeed cheesy. It feels like a budget 70s car with major kick of course."

Its stock chart looks like a high flying tech stock, not like an insurance stock. Here\u2019s why this is so good and any health insurance stock for that matter. When Obama came into office he created Obamacare.  Obama care basically allowed the health insurance companies to write alot of the current government regulations.  One thing they actually created as a result of all this new legislation is technically \u201cprice fixing\u201d. While they will never admit to this, this is the reality. Price fixing is illegal in every industry and companies get fined for it all the time. In this case, basically the government is signing off on this so called price fixing although they will never call it that.\nHow do I know this you might ask. Well I spent over 20 years in the investment industry and was self employed for most of that time and a lot of my clients were some of the biggest brands in the investment industry.  But that\u2019s not really why I know this. I know this because I was and still am a business owner and I have had to buy a lot of health insurance over the years.  Prior to Obamacare the health insurance market was competitive, you could shop around to get the best deal. When my existing health insurer would jack up our rate on the renewal, we would just switch carriers and it would bring the rate back down. Obamacare eliminated that competition among insurers. So now when my health insurer jacks my rate every year and I go look for another insurance carrier, they are oddly at the same jacked up rate my current insurer is at. So no longer a cost saving benefit to switching carriers and we\u2019re forced into annual increases no matter what.\nThe health insurance companies have been claiming they struggle financially but if you look at the chart. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case. Their charts are more like high flying tech companies but with a couple of main differences\u2026 low to cheap P/E ratios and a government backed price fixing theme with recurring locked in revenues that grow on top of themselves year after year. \nJust food for thought and sorry for the long dissertation\u2026 lol"

Tesla shares are down more than 15% over the last five sessions. \\n\\nIt seem Elon will keep selling Telsa stocks this week to finish his 10% goal. Investors can start a small position this week under 1k as tesla is still the industry leader and very far ahead for many competitors. If the stock really drop back to $900, then it could consider to add more position.'",

After Model 3, it continually missed production targets and wavered in pricing. When it started hitting production targets late 2019 and after it increased 800%. Now, it is recognized as a low margin business (by Musk himself) similar to other car manufacturers. I've been one of the biggest Tesla bulls I've ever known going back to when I had to debate Tesla vs. Ford to an experienced alternative investment manager, a partner at a small fund, during a job interview. But, I need to say at this point, something is not right or I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid right. It doesn't make sense that a low margin and almost fully matured business is growing the way Tesla does. This looks like a massive bubble and I would advise people take some or a majority of earnings before the pin drops."

After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.\\n\\nBeing a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' \\n\\nHowever, there has been a change. Things\"",

     "Not even considering your point about changing customer sentiment in the West (with which I entirely agree) and the growing number of EV alternatives, I think it\u2019s also worth looking at where Tesla sees its growth now. There is a clear bet on China which I personally think is becoming increasingly risky: China has its own EV producers and supply chains, it doesn\u2019t need Tesla (or selling in the West), while Tesla desperately needs China. \n\n\nFurthermore, the confrontation with the West and the economic competition is becoming more intense, there are talks of decoupling, multinational firms are starting to establish alternative supply chains, there are already some strategic bans on technology transfers on the us side (semiconductors) and import bans (xianjiang), I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if within the next 5 years China retaliates and Tesla gets trapped. Of course, all automotive OEMs have a footprint in China, but mostly in their supply chains, i don\u2019t think any of them have that much China exposure to their top line."

There\u2019s a very weird paradox that has developed in the past year and it does not fair well for Tesla at all in my opinion:\n\nLast year, all of my younger coworkers (myself included) loved Elon, and also loved Tesla. All of my older coworkers didn\u2019t care about Elon, but hated Tesla.\n\nNow in the present, all of my younger coworkers hate Elon and also hate Tesla. Some of these folks have traded in their Teslas lol. All of my older coworkers love Elon, but they still hate Tesla.\n\nOverall, now EVERYONE I work with hates Tesla. Now my workplace could be a bad representation of the country as a whole, but in my personal experience the future does not look bright."

I imagine those who can afford a 100+k car are more sensitive to exactly what you described. These are likely orders placed months ago that the customer decided to cancel. Of course the recession is playing a role but it looks more than that. On the other hand, Model 3 inventories are gone, likely the $7,500 incentive helped.\n\nI\u2019ve been in and out of TSLA since IPO.

Elon said it will be fully functional in a couple years around 8 years ago at this point.  I don\u2019t think people will continue to add the feature considering they haven\u2019t delivered.  Cybertruk and the semi also seem to be having problems delivering.  Elon has also indicated they are building a robot now?  I can only assume it\u2019s to work on Mars prior to the arrival of people?  Long story short - Tesla has lost focus.  Supporters would often stand in line and put deposits on their vehicles because they believe in the mission (as you said).  As they fail to deliver, this fan base will continue to dwindle.  Add these points to the amazing point in your post and I think Tesla is in trouble.  There\u2019s also the fact that they clearly haven\u2019t figured out full self driving.  How many cars will they need to retrofit because they were sold as full self driving capable?"

His beliefs roughly map out exactly the same as before.\n\nThe only difference is that the left has been attacking him relentlessly for the last 5 years, and him calling out corruption on the left that has singled him out has made people on the left very angry despite Elon being correct to point out injustice and corruption in the first place.\n\nOH, Biden was the only president to not mention successful space missions because it was with SpaceX? Biden didn't invite Tesla or ever mention it when talking about EVs? Despite the fact that Trump had no interest in EVs or global warming, he still reached out to Elon with open arms, who was a very prominent and public Democrat at the time. Biden turning Elon into public enemy #1 when he has done more to advance green energy, job creation and manufacturing in the US, AI dominance, and space and energy independence/leadership is just straight up corruption because we all know who donates to Democratic politicians. \n\nAlameda County tried to literally bankrupt Tesla by being the only place to prevent manufacturing in the US indefinitely when Tesla only had one real factory producing at scale? Warren and Sanders and AOC and Reich tried to call Elon evil for the last 5 years just so they could take his Tesla shares as taxes? The media called Elon a MAGA Republican despite him never previously voting for a Republican (including Trump)? The media making up lies about his Twitter takeover and covering up the Biden laptop, government collusion, speech suppression and censorship, and blatant 1st amendment violations, and the SBF fraud while making Elon look like some evil dictator? Let it be known that the left deliberately tried to destroy Twitter before Elon even tried to do anything to fix it by forcing an advertiser boycott, causing him to fire 75% of the staff to reach cash flow neutral, which then the left used to call him a monster.\n\nYou can't repeatedly punch a guy who fixed your house and put your kid through college and expect him to keep his mouth shut. And then to call him some sort of racist/homophobe/evil capitalist trying to destroy America as some fascist when literally the definition of fascism is government control of private companies by groups of people fascinated and preoccupied with notions of racial supremacy and authoritarian rule that has restricted free speech (literally the current Democratic platform), is just insult to injury. The fact that people give friends of Esptein a pass like Clinton and Bill Gates, and support companies like Apple that build phones in sweatshops with suicide nets just to call Elon Musk a crazy person who is immoral and losing his grip on reality is just rich."

He *did* have a knack for getting into exciting future sectors. But that's it. He is actually a shit manager and decision maker. And he is not an engineer, but a poser. \n\nAll of that has been more and more apparent for a while. And the Twitter acquisition was just the culmination of bad judgement and big ego."

     "I'm honestly also one of those people you're talking about OP. A very long time ago even before Tesla started gaining any traction & before it was in the news all the time, I discovered Tesla and told a lot of people about this amazing car I really wanted.\n\nThen I started to follow Musk on Twitter and realised for myself what a POS he was even before the sub incident so stopped following him. Then the sub incident happened and Musk started to slowly snowball into an even bigger POS and as he grew bigger my interest in wanting a Tesla became smaller and eventually I no longer wanted one.\n\nThen a good friend invested in them and very quickly turned into an obsessed cultists just because of how much money it made him, and eventually convinced me invest too. I managed to put my morality a side for a while, but whenever I was going to sell at the top he convinced to hold on, and I did not because I believed in Tesla, but because I believed dumbasses like him would continue to pump it and I was in it for the ride.\n\nThen at the beginning of the year the markets started coming down and I finally managed to pull out entirely while taking some profit, and kept contemplating whether I should invest back into Tesla alongside the others, but my morality just taking even bigger hits as Musk had turned into one of the biggest c**ts on the planet.\n\nNow just like with Facebook I longer want anything to do with Elon & Tesla. I got rid of Twitter because of him too (though I physically can't log back in to delete my account) and I just hope my friend's sake he'll wake up before he loses everything.\n\nThere's only one small thing I disagree with though in your view, and that's that Tesla can never shake its association with Musk. I believe it could eventually but it would take a very long time after he's no longer involved. As you said now when you mention Bill Gates a lot of people do still think \"Microsoft\", however when you say \"Microsoft\" most people no longer think \"Bill Gates\" (aside from maybe those who still believe he's the richest man in the world)."

     "Has Been Real for me for the last year. It was fun to learn about the future and have faith in a company with such big ideas and opportunity, but it hasn't been real fun. It has gone up since I bought it. That is not why I invested; I did it because I believe in their mission and product. The bad news is that Elon Musk will continue to damage the brand because of his personal opinion on things, including climate change. Right now, this is not a big deal to me because I do think they will get through this difficult time and will have solid growth going forward, but my confidence could very easily be hurt if they are unable to execute well or if they cannot execute at all. Tesla's stock price hinged on the self-driving car market. I'm not sure what the prospects are of them building a monopoly in this space, but that was a major reason why I was comfortable investing. If they cannot execute well and they lose some time to competitors they will have trouble growing as quickly as they need to. To answer your second point, yes Elon Musk is a big advertising asset for TSLA. He is an amazing leader that has made incredible strides in the development of battery technology and has improved the efficiency of cars incredibly through Tesla's design. However, Elon Musk is also a big liability for TSLA. He is the face of the brand, which means that the people who are considering the purchase of a Tesla and those that already have one will be influenced by his antics, including his expensive tweets."

Tesla will continue its shift in to perfecting the supply chain and mass producing cars, investing in its solar business, and expanding battery products. It would make sense for Tesla to insert a more operations focused CEO instead of a product visionary. This will let Elon focus more of his time his other ventures such as SpaceX. Tesla needs to be a boring company focused on execution, iteration, and delivering massive shareholder value. \n\nApple set the playbook as Tim Cook took over and brought his rigid operations experience to scaling Apple. While apple has gotten significantly more boring, the economics of the company have never been better. Tesla could do well from the same treatment."

Since everyone is talking about an upcoming recession in the late 2023 would it be wise to wait off to buy back in assuming the market will crash.\\n\\nI am aware that in a long run the stocks Im looking to buy will most likely thrive in a long run such as Apple, google, Microsoft, Tesla. Im just looking for the best opportunity considering the circumstances.'",

Often times we have certain safeguards in place, whether that is conscious or not.\\n\\nThink of the time you were taught that before passing on the other side of a street, you need to take a look left and right (or right and left, depending on the country you live in). If we dissect this simple event, the risk comes from all the vehicles on the street and the safeguard is taking a look to make sure it is safe.\\n\\nNow, in the world of investing, there are plenty of risks, but not that many articles when it comes to safeguards.

This does not apply to indexes but it does to individual securities commodities or other investments. \n\nThe second one is thinking about where you're going to get out. Both of these go through my head before I ever put on a trade. It took me about 7 years before I became profitable. Realizing where I'm wrong has probably been the single best skill along with not taking advice from people online.
