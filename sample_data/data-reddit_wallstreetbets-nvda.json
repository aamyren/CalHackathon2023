If you want to run AI on your GPU, you're limited to smaller models or you must spend a lot for the larger ones. But it's not *that* far off. Current  higher end GPUs have 12-20GB of VRAM. The smallest model for I think GPT-2 is like 40GB. Once these become available, it's more feasible that you can run this technology locally. Give it another <10 years and you can run these models on your smartphone. There is plenty of room to grow with AI. Nvidia still needs to actually make use of this investment money if they want to succeed here though because big companies are entering the GPU market and may become less dependent on Nvidia."

     "The problem is not that NVDA doesn't have a viable product, or that NVDA doesn't have one of the biggest moats in the history of technomoats. The issue is that their valuation leaves them precariously overexposed to a market drop.\n\nLook at Intel in the years 1999 - 2000. We would need a big market catalyst to drop the price quite a bit, but in such a case, they would slough like crazy.\n\nIntel actually had a significantly (and relatively over time) lower PE ratio is 1999, https://www.fool.com/archive/dripport/1999/06/04/intel-ligent-valuation-drip-port-june-4-1999.aspx, but doubled in 2000 on the bubble, and then popped back down to 20 after the crash.\n\nAll the while, they had a solid tech moat. Making CPU chips that others couldn't make, and while all the other companies that were buying Intel chips either went bankrupt, or otherwise decreased demand, Intel survived due to incredible footwork in fast shifting winds. Well, and again, because they had the same moat that NVDA has now.\n\nThis isn't a call to stock up on NVDA puts. No clue how this market will go. Anyways, NVDA is a mature growth company. \n\nFor all intents and purposes, NVDA is a company with its feet firmly planted, yet they have a barely realized market and 20 years of a head start. Nobody (in the business world at least) thought that graphics cards would ever be used by anyone besides glorified dungeons and dragons fans.\n\nI'm not sure Nvidia even knew about the potential. You could say they were quite lucky, because they've developed these cards with one competitor who targeted cheap cards, while they targeted advancement while nobody was watching, which put them in the perfect position to dominate AI (again, who knew a GPU would be used for AI in 2000?). \n\nSpurred by crypto miners, they fleshed out the number systems they could use for computations. It's almost this perfect storm, and an insatiable desire to be the very best that has put them in the position they are in. I'm not talking about the market. I'm talking about them as a company which makes a product. They just keep coming up with the best solutions, that put them into positions to capitalize on unforeseen opportunity. \n\nSomebody must've had a good fortune cookie.\n\nIt's not necessarily the same thing as Intel.\n\nBut nonetheless, if the market turns, you better believe NVDA puts will print and somebody out there will probably gobble up a literal fortune.\n\nBecause anyways, Intel's AI processing is not that terrible compared to Nvidia. In fact, it's marginally cheaper to run a full AI training set as far as energy goes, just so... unbelievably slooooow compared.\n\nBut do we genuinely see a big drop happening? Do we actually have an incorrectly leveraged market right now? Or maybe, could investor choices change rapidly? For example, if war broke out and America was directly involved, would big time investors still want to keep as much money in this stock?\n\nHonestly, what I see happening is a huge surprise on the earnings to come from here, so that the price to earnings ratio will be quickly justifi- well... less unjustifiable - back in the orbit of our solar system at least.\n\nI don't care if I'm wrong either way prediction wise, other than to say, I like the tech, bro.\n\nWill the price go down in the meantime? I wouldn't be surprised, but remember, the market can remain irrational far longer than you can remain solvent. Maybe some of that extrinsic rationale will become a bit more of a rational valuation. \n\nOr at least, AI AI AI AI AI AI AI"

They were genuinely as important to society as people believed - they still ate shit during the dot com bubble.\n\nImportant product/company does not equate to being properly valued. There's a reason a company like Nvidia is riding this hype train, and the hype being there in the first place is deserving in some capacity, but that does not mean it should be worth over a trillion dollars. Such an obscene amount of money! Arguably no company should, but if you look at the other companies in the club, at least they make sense.\n\nEven if you would counter with the fact that our ideas of what proper valuations are may be outdated (a P/E > 25 being the benchmark is extremely outdated and myopic) this is obviously a hype train. If you invested right now, you're probably betting more so on the idea that more people will keep buying than you are that it will continue to accumulate value, even if those are \"technically\" the same idea.\n\nThe only rebuttal I would accept is a comparison to Tesla, in the sense that people will be so bought into the idea of Nvidia being valuable that the actual valuation won't matter, even though it's absurd by every metric out there, and that people will just keep buying regardless of the valuations. It feels like bad odds to bet that the company will remain detached from the actual finances though."

The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.\n\nAnd the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.\n\nI take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. \n\nShould it be this way? No.\n\nDoes it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely. It's an apples and oranges comparison."

     "Nvidia has been riding on the crypto boom since 2016.  The market did crash in 2017 and Nvidia coasted on their RTX 20 series which weren't well received.  Then COVID19 happened and everyone got government checks and stayed home to play games, but more importantly another crypto boom happened.  The crypto market went proof of stake, which means you won't be using Nvidia GPU's to mine crypto.  To the day the #2 GPU used on Steam is the GTX 1060, a 2016 graphics card.  The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.  Also these bulls are looking for anything that goes up and their collective mind has settled on Nvidia."

After seeing it rally another 20% after earnings today one has to ask themselves, is it time to short the chip manufacturing giant NVDA. With a whopping 750B Market cap is it really worth the price we see on our brokerages. \\nIf you ask me Id say maybe its time to take some profits and flip a little bit bearish but who am I?'",

The second one is if you watch the movements of the markets long enough you begin to anticipate what's going to happen. \n\nAt no point have I ever found financial news helpful in what they are saying.

I know AI AI AI AI.... but be specific? Who is footing a data center expansion this large... or is this direct to consumer sales and there is a return to the local systems for AI?\n- These are on existing products / chip sets and no RD costs or moves/cost in production shift to move to AI or its specialty chip-sets?\n\nI find the turnaround interesting to say the least. \n\nIf you want to fire the flame throwers be my guest,,, but be specific and don't throw rocks.

     "Beautiful. You spend a significant portion of your life working on something that you believe is going to be impactful in the future, and you toil away driven by that inner core conviction that it will be impactful some day. When you see this come to fruition, and the rest of us normies finally see what you were seeing and believing all along, and us normies start piling on the Buy orders to grab shares in your company, damn right you should sell a lot of shares and enjoy the fruits of years of time and effort poured into that wild adventure. Because you might have been 100% convinced that what you were working on would be big someday, but you weren\u2019t a complete idiot and knew that it might not exactly turn out as a resounding success. So, yes, when you get to a successful outcome, go ahead and sell a bunch of shares. Go give your loved ones a hug, let them know that you love them, and that this is what you felt compelled to work towards all this time, and celebrate hard with them. You deserve it!"

You may need to speak to the margins or options desk to make this work smoothly (because you may not have enough cash available to make a massive trade in NVDA), but it allows you to get 99.9% of intrinsic value rather than feeling trapped into hitting a crummy bid.\n\nIf you want to be super-cautious, you can even do it 100 shares at a time and, once you cover/sell, repeat as often as desired.

A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via\u00a0Bloomberg):\n\nAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?"

I don\u2019t ever wish anyone harm, but every failure she or anyone has is a chance for a wake up call, so have no problems in enjoying this catastrophe. Very pleasant and soothing indeed. The consistency and magnitude of these L\u2019s are almost meditative.\n\nThe days come and go. My life is happening, things are always changing. Yet with all this constant motion, Cathie Woods consistently drops the worst trades like clockwork. A steady, colossal, drip of Ls. Every loss she takes is so big it\u2019s scale is lost on my simple mind. Yet there they go. One by one. Each loss and failure measured on a celestial scale that is beyond my grasp. Bigger Ls than I can understand with dollar amounts bigger than what I\u2019ve ever seen or may ever see. I know that no matter what happens in my small little life, Cathie is out there, in the ether, losing more money than I could ever even know.\n\nCathie\u2019s Ls loom over us all in the aether, dripping so mightily. How could us, such small beings, be bound by the same force of time as such colossal and awe inspiring losses? Yet here we are. If time is a big enough place for Cathie\u2019s losses to exist, then how small must we be\u2026 in the grand scheme of time.\n\nThese posts bring me true bliss and contentment."

It looks like there were a bunch of people buying, and no one selling and that pumped the price due to artificial scarcity. When the profit taking begins, the share price will fall rapidly. It will probably hold on to most of its gains as there will also be more buyers and not just more sellers in a higher volume environment.\\n\\nIf you won your NVDA, it will be a max dash to take your profits tomorrow morning. I suggest liquidating during pre market.\\n\\nAll yall with huge unrealized gains on your options, hopefully youre still ITM after pre market price action. Expect huge slippage when youre selling your calls if youre not deep ITM when options trading resumes. \\n\\n\\nWhat happens after the pre market and opening sell off? FOMO dip buyers, scalpers, and passive funds rebalancing will help stem the losses to a degree. Or, the market will see a falling knife and steer clear. \\n\\n!banbet NVDA $350 in 12h\\n\\n\\nPo'",

Both were the major market leaders back in 2012-2016, and at times Samsung was > Apple in people's opinion. But, in the end Apple is still basically the market leader in the smart phone market to this date. So it's going to be hard to knock NVDA off it's podium, the only way AMD could get ahead is NVDA's CEO steps down or god forbid passes on and the new CEO goes down the path of Intel. Where they focus on investor returns and compensation package and forget about development/growth. And AMD manages to continue down its path of development/growth. People have to remember NVDA only managed to get to where it was because they refused to give up on development and focus on growth. It took years, I remember when I first learned of NVDA as a stock/company  when it was about $60-70 range and now look at it. Post stock split 400+, but it took NVDA 4-5 years to reach it."

A majority of their money is still made in Graphical computing, not just data centers and AI. With the 4000 series cards coming after a flooded 3000 series market combined with additional new cloud gaming and console gaming options in the last 2 years, combined with a cooling of the general market I would expect to see profitability drop in the next 3-6 months. Once NVDA shows a decreased earnings expectation (and people realize that AI takes a lot of time to develop and won\u2019t show returns for a few years) the market will flee and the price will reset. \n\nMark my words though, NVDA long term will be one of the top 20 companies on the market in the next 10 years though."

     "I asked ChatGPT-4 this\\^ prompt:  \n\n\n\"While I cannot predict future market movements or specific events, there are several factors that could potentially trigger a repricing of a stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) if it is considered overvalued:\n\n1. Earnings reports: If the company releases earnings reports that fall short of market expectations, investors may reevaluate their positions, leading to a decline in the stock price.\n2. Market sentiment: Shifts in market sentiment, driven by factors such as macroeconomic data, geopolitical tensions, or changes in the industry landscape, can affect stock prices. A negative sentiment shift could lead to a repricing of an overvalued stock.\n3. Changes in the competitive landscape: If new competitors emerge or existing competitors gain a significant advantage, it may impact NVIDIA's market position, triggering a repricing of its stock.\n4. Regulatory changes: Changes in regulations or government policies that negatively affect the company's business prospects can lead to a decline in its stock price.\n5. Analyst downgrades: If prominent market analysts downgrade the stock or lower their price targets, it could lead to a selloff.\n6. Sector rotation: If investors start moving their funds from the technology sector to other sectors (due to changing market conditions or a perception that other sectors offer better growth opportunities), it could negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.\n7. Profit-taking: If a significant number of investors decide to lock in their gains and sell the stock, it may cause a decline in the stock price.\n\nIt's essential to remember that predicting specific triggers for a repricing is difficult, as market dynamics are complex and constantly changing. It is always a good idea to do thorough research, stay informed about market developments, and consult with a financial advisor when making investment decisions.\""

     "Here\u2019s the English version brought to you by our lord and savior chatgpt\n \u201cThis is a fanciful tale about a character named Rizzly, who is a stock market bear - meaning he anticipates a decrease in market prices, and profits by short-selling stocks. He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.\n\nIn this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in \"puts\", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.\n\nTo fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.\n\nThe story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths. The narrator of the story then reveals their position: they hold 30 Nvidia put options, meaning they too are betting on Nvidia's stock price to decrease.\n\nThe TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of this post is: \"Buy NVDA puts\", meaning the author is advising to purchase put options for Nvidia's stock, betting that the price will drop. The meteor emojis \u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f are used to symbolize a dramatic fall.\u201d"

The market has already priced this in. \n* AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI (see my previous post). However, I believe that GOOGL and MSFT have more downside than upside potential due to antitrust concerns. This leaves NVDA as the best pick in the space. Additionally, since a large portion of its revenue is derived from data center sales, it is less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn compared to other tech companies. Therefore, I believe that NVDA will outperform the market in both good and bad times which makes it a great long term investment. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time \n* FOMO - All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon eventually pushing prices even higher .This could add another 60%+to today's value giving us a target price of around $700"

The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. \\n\\nI also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF.

     "Scott McNeely was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of the year 2000 tech bubble. At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via Bloomberg):\n\nAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?"

     "So, what was your original game plan?\n\n**Trading Plan: Rules of the trade**\n\n***What Is a Trading Plan?***\n\nA trading plan is a systematic method for identifying and trading securities that takes into consideration a number of variables including time, risk and price objectives. A trading plan outlines how a trader will find and execute trades, including under what conditions they will buy securities, and then exit or sell those securities. A trader will also consider how large of a position they will take, how they will manage positions while in them, what securities can be traded, and other rules for when to trade and when not to. Ideally a trader should also have a watch list of around 10 securities that they are familiar with, and follow regularly.\n\nMost trading experts recommend that no capital is risked until a trading plan is made. A trading plan is based on personal stock market research that guides a trader's decisions. A trading plan is a roadmap for how to trade, and no trades should be placed without a basic plan in hand. The plan should be written down and followed. And it is not altered unless it is found not to work (make money) or the trader finds a way to improve it.\n\nTrading plans can be built in a variety of different ways. Investors will typically customize their own trading plan based on their personal goals and objectives. Trading plans can be lengthy and detailed, or as simple as one or two sentences. Active traders, especially, should have a simple written plan for day trades or swing trades. They should have very simple plans that are easy enough for a 6th grader to follow.\n\nThe trading plan outlines not only what to do to get into positions, but also states when to get out. The Active trader needs to come up with rules for exactly when they will enter a trade. This could be based on a chart pattern, the price reaching a certain level, a technical indicator signal, a statistical bias, or other factors.\n\nThe trading plan must also state how to exit positions. This includes exiting with a profit, or how and when to get out with a loss. Active traders will often utilize limit orders to take profits and stop loss orders to exit their losses. The trading plan also outlines how much capital is risked on each trade, and how position size is determined.\n\nAdditional rules may also be added which specify when it is acceptable to trade and when it isn't. A day trader, for example, may have a rule where they don't trade if volatility is extremely high. If volatility is too high, they don't trade, even if their entry criteria is triggered."

Will money flow into NDX funds and create a positive feedback loop for tech mega caps?\n\n\nI threw about 25% of my portfolio at NVDS (inverse leveraged NVDA ETF) after hours at the first significant resistance level (when NVDA hit $350). But then NVDA kept on going up and NVDS kept on going down. Oh well, I think I\u2019ll be able to break even on it, maybe I\u2019ll sell some covered calls to counter the inverse-leveraged decay.\n\nI sold some $13 strike 6/16 NVDS puts earlier today.

Now, before you downvote me to oblivion, hear me out because I believe we might be witnessing a potential bubble about to burst.\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\nNVDA has been on an absolute tear in recent years.

I withdrew $23k around the time my account got to $30k from some TSLA puts (when it dropped from $220 to $200 in one day). The majority of my gains this month are from NVDA. I bought 15 12/30 177.5 puts when it was around 178 and sold for a 10k gain when it dropped to 154. Then I bought 30 1/6 NVDA 165 puts and sold for $48k gain when it dropped to $142 yesterday.

I know it might sound counterintuitive, but having an overvalued stock with an extremely high P/E ratio could actually be a fantastic opportunity for us.  \\n\\nFirst things first, let\\'s address the elephant in the room: the valuation. NVDA has been soaring to the moon lately, and some might argue that it has become overpriced. But hey, remember what we always say: \"The stonk market can remain irrational longer than we can stay solvent.\" And boy, have we seen that happen time and time again!  \\n\\n1 Dominance in the GPU Market: NVDA has established itself as a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market.

This dominance provides a strong foundation for their growth prospects, enabling them to capitalize '",

     "NVDA undervalued? More like NVDA overhyped!\nNVDA is not a leader in anything, it\u2019s a follower that relies on other companies\u2019 innovations. It has a weak competitive advantage with its commoditized GPUs and software platforms. It has a fickle customer base and a shrinking market share. It has consistently delivered inflated earnings and revenue growth, thanks to accounting tricks and stock buybacks.\nNVDA\u2019s P/E ratio is absurd, it reflects its hype and speculation. NVDA is a cyclical stock that depends on the economy and consumer demand. It\u2019s a bubble stock that bursts when reality hits and competition intensifies. NVDA is not undervalued, it\u2019s a risky gamble.\nHow can you justify NVDA\u2019s valuation? Do you have any logic to support your claim?

This versatility will help them continue to grow even if one market declines.\n2. AI is definitely the future and NVDA is well-positioned to benefit from its adoption. Their GPUs are essential for training and running AI models, making them a key player in this ecosystem.\n3. The high P/E ratio suggests that investors have high expectations for NVDA's earnings potential going forward. And with all of the exciting developments taking place at the company, these expectations may not be unrealistic after all!"

I\u2019d expect it to trade flattish on Monday and similar today on Tuesday to wait for AMD\u2019s report. If AMD misses you should be close to ITM at that point. You might look at selling the June 16th 140 puts to hedge the down move with 142 being a resistance level you could use to short on the break to cover if needed. That just gives you an option so you wouldn\u2019t have to take a loss and possible miss the move down."

NVDA earnings release was at 2:00 PM\\n\\nIn theory is a bullish tweet if you assume that he loves his dog. But algos (AI) may have interpreted it like \"NVDA is like a dog\" so it will \"underperform\".\\n\\nMaybe that sparked a signal on the algos and they started to bid NVDA shares helping to drive it to ATHs (I bet advanced algos support the inverseCramer signal)\\n\\nSome hours later Cramer started tweeting clearly unambiguous bullish tweets about NVDA. The thing is that he tweeted those after trading was closed. After hours trading ends at 8:00 PM ET (which is 5:00 PM PDT) and he did that tweet at 5:13 PM PDT\\n\\nWow! Will the Algos reverse and sell tomorrow?\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see what happens'",

The new specification they are working with have the first generation of data cable pins on the power connectors:  and they fucking suck cuz they are so flimsy that they released a liability statement saying you are only guaranteed so many plugs/unplugs before failure.  The crypto mining crash has crippled their whales that they nurtured at the expense of the rest of us, likely will not recover any time soon.  They also mistreated EVGA business partners to the point of EVGA reorganising so they never have to work with nVidia ever again.  Finally, they were just an unethical company to begin with:  they patented so much code and applications of the technology that other brands aren't allowed to make even remotely similar rendering techniques without being sued up the ass.  They singlehandedly held the gaming industry back 10 years and almost successfully monopolized the global market."

What's to stop a CEO/CFO that gets stock options in the future from announcing a 15 billion buyback since buybacks don't have a time frame it doesn't matter how long it takes them to complete it say this in itself causes the stock to pump 20%. Then they start to do a very small portion of the buyback say 3 billion over 2 quarters which at an average of 150 per share is around 20 million shares and reporting those buybacks along with pumping causes another 25% raise you're now up 45% in 180 days. After those 180 day and being up 45% you do a mixed shelf for say 10 billion and with the increased priced you selling at an average of 200 now increasing the shares buy 50 million. So from the start you now have increased the outstanding shares by 30 million with raising 6 billion in capital. Well this a\"",

This is because each company's situation is unique, and the SEC would likely only allow such a move if it believed that it was in the best interests of shareholders. Additionally, even if the SEC did set a precedent with Nvidia, there is no guarantee that other companies would follow suit. Each company must make its own decisions about what actions are in its best interests, and many factors would need to be considered before deciding whether or not to pursue a similar strategy."

That's fear inducing.\n\nWatch the DMI and look for bears to take control on the 4hr and greater time frames. We are either in a topping process or bears are starting to enter. Most likely the big hitters are waiting for FOMC so they don't get blown out. I'd expect some jitters before the meeting. \n\nShort term is up, but I don't think it can go much farther.

The expectation that all these AI companies will somehow needs alot of new chips doesnt make sense. The services are live now and everyone that needed chips to launch their bots(Chat GPT; Google; Microsoft etc) already have what they need. This reminds me of the time when everyone thought broadband was going to be huge and super expensive. Same hype was around crypto. This is just another boom cycle. The time to buy NVDA was 3 months ago.\\n\\nAlso there is still AI regulation and laws to be created. If you think AI will write your resume, cover letter, college essay or do your work for you, it wont.

Buckle up, because it's time to talk about a stock that's primed for some explosive gains. \\n\\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the unstoppable GPU powerhouse that's about to see gaming revenues skyrocket, despite the hurting crypto industry.\\n\\nCrypto Who? \\nWhile it's true that NVIDIA has dipped its toes into the crypto waters with their Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line, don't let the current crypto slump fool you. In Q1 2021, CMP sales accounted for only $155 million, about 2.74% of NVIDIA's total revenue of $5.66 billion. That's peanuts compared to their gaming segment, which brought in a whopping $2.76 billion or 49% of the total revenue.

Covid juiced up game revenue for a year or two but it is reverted back to the mean now. \n\nWhat I am excited about and not on many people\u2019s radar is their datacenter virtual GPU offerings. Rich content and digital assets are being created at an unprecedented rate. Older computers are being replaced with light-spec laptops and workloads are shifted to data centers with virtual GPUs. This is currently not a huge market yet, but it could develop into a major profit center if the trend continues. I used to demand a physical beefy machine under my desk, but now I only want a 16-inch laptop and 2 32-inch monitors and a good-spec VM that fits my need."

AI will require more graphic, data centers and cloud computing, and u can get those also from AMD. at this point NVDA  is a scam that is selling them self as the only AI resource, while diluit share holder with a 10b offering and  insiders are selling their stocks. Open Ai and some other Ai tools were here since 2020. tiktok and youtube content creator are given so much attention and is ok  AI will defently going to be important in the near future but not for that reason u will justify a company at 21x Ev/sales, we havent learn anything from 2021.

So nowadays 90% of ML code infrastructure uses CUDA which only works with NVIDIA hardware. You can see that if a new hardware wants to compete with them has a giant hill to climb.

     "I hold puts on NVDA. And buy more puts on each bear market rally. So, obviously biased, but here's an important point you did not mention.\n\nData center sales for expensive GPUs is a very lagging indicator. These GPUs are great, essential for ML training workloads and nVidia has a monopolistic position in the market. Their APIs and frameworks are unmatched, although Intel and AMD are slowly creeping in.\n\nEveryone will tell you how great data center sales are, how they are growing and that this matters the most, and thus you can ignore poor retail sales.\n\nHowever, data center sales by large cloud providers are planned at least a year ahead. I'm talking about AWS, AZURE, and GCP.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, large clouds were caught off guard and did not have enough capacity to meet the demand. As everyone else in the economy, they over reacted and over provisioned. Chip shortage made situation much worse, as they couldn't fullfil their orders for a year.\n\nNow, those orders are coming in and the demand isn't there anymore. Again, like everyone else, large clouds now have more capacity than there's demand in the market. \n\nAnd all tech CEOs are confident recession is coming. They all almost froze hiring, many top companies went through at least one round of layoffs, reduced budgets, spending and capital investments. Cost optimizations are everywhere.\n\nAnd what those large clouds will cut first when they believe recession is around the corner, and they are already over provisioned and expect demand to fall further? New and expensive chips will be the first to go.\n\nAs tech over reacted on the up side they will now over react on the down side. Nvidia sales reflect orders from 2020-2021, that's like housing demand from May 2021. Those sales have already cratered, but are not reflected in the quarterly reports yet. Once they do you will see a sharp drop, surprised analytics, huge earnings miss and confused dip buyers.\n\nOnce everyone starts talking how bad data centers sales are, I'll close my puts.\n\nFor nvidia to become a buy again I'll need to see some leaks about their new generation of chips with better cost/efficiency ratio. This is what market wants and nvidia can't deliver. \n\nCurrently nvidia is trapped overpaying for the best TSMC node to produce expensive energy hungry products with falling demand. That will drag their profit margins down even further until they improve efficiency and negotiate a better deal with foundries."

When it dips, people will buy it, and at some point, we\u2019re going to get a bullish tech market again and the shares will achieve an even greater premium. Their growth prospects in the ~10 year span are better than most mega cap companies, yet they are also one of the safest growth investments out there. \n\nNo doubt, you might make money playing NVDA, but I would watch out how long you\u2019re short."

I guess she expects them to drop significantly and will likely rebuy shares after earnings or wait longer until market crashes. This is a great opportunity to buy puts. She did this right before Q2 earnings before a massive drop. Sorry I just Dont believe in coincidences. The CEO and director also continue to unload their shares of NVDA.'",

Nvidia is heading into tough economic conditions where they are selling gas guzzling Lambos and everyone wants fuel efficient Teslas.\n\nAMD's Navi 31 is the first step into chiplet based GPU's.  AMD has been doing it for years now with  Zen  and I would imagine they now have the ability to take the performance crown away from Nvidia in the next generation (or sooner if they respin the Navi 31 silicon).\n\n7900 XTX is within 15% of the 4090 based on preliminary benchmarks.  The 4090 is also priced 60% higher than the 7900 XTX ($1,600 vs $999) and the 4080 is priced 20% more than the 7900 XTX ($1,200 vs $999).  In short I don't believe Nvidia can hold their prices long term if they expect the same volumes as the last generation which included massive crypto mining.\n\nNvidia trading at a 40x multiple.  I expect earnings to take a major hit in the next fiscal year.  I could see that pulling back to a 30x and and earnings halved.  i.e..  Major downside potential."

Something like over 80% of all S and P 500 companies will beat expected earnings.  I'll repeat it again.  A beat is.not.special. In fact, a beat is pretty much expected and the bare minimum required to pass an ER.  The only way an earnings beat will pump a stock is if it is truly a gigantar beat that is way, way, wayyyyy over expectations.  NVDA's beat was not 'massive'.  \n\nSecondly, learn kindergarten fundamentals.  NVDA was trading almost at 80 P/E.  Do you not understand what that means?  It means NVDA is massively overvalued and priced for absolute perfection.  Growth going forward has already been priced in.  When growth stocks reach such extreme valuations, it leaves absolutely zero room for error.  Any signs of weakness will tank the stock while the upside is extremely limited because so much of it has been priced in.  Forward guidance for such an extremely expensive stock needs to be a WOW YOU BLEW MY MIND WITH SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED.  NVDA did not provide that. They projected higher, but it was nothing truly, stupendously amazing.  That's the problem with chasing shit with such extreme valuations.  Companies just cannot keep up with expectations to make stock prices grow.  Expectations need to fall back down to reality and need to reset."

It's just not worth it because it's like Whose Line where the points don't matter.  It's why I dumped every option I have in team green 2 days ago to get out of the way of earnings and said I would be back in next week no matter what up or down.  I knew the company was going to crush it, but I also knew the computers saw the social sentiment was bullish and the way to make the most money was to kill it.\n\nMeanwhile, $DASH missed badly on the top line and announced they were blowing more money than ever.  But everybody was bearish, so it shot up 25%.  Because everybody was bearish.\n\nInverse WSB isn't a meme, and it's not because the ideas here are generally bad.

Sky's the limit and expansions are free money.\n\nSo that's why revenue beats themselves don't mean shit.

The simultaneous action, the highest volume sales, the contrariness to strong earnings, cannot come from retail investors, and can only come from coordinated action by institutional funds that lent, hedge funds that borrowed, and brokerages that brokered the borrowing.\n\nIf anyone thinks the market is free and fair, after so many instances similar to NVDA, for no other plausible reason, the seller of the Brooklyn Bridge is waiting eagerly for you.\n\nIt is time to reinstate the uptick rule established by the SEC on 1938 under Rule 10a-1 that prohibits short selling unless the preceding trade was an uptick.  This rule was revoked in 2007, and in one year or less, we had the market meltdown of 2008, due perhaps to a mere over-extended 250 billion bad mortgages that accelerated into a collapse of trillions of dollars of CDS, and the failure of Lehman and AIG.  The hole in the dike could have been plugged with a finger, but the finger, Rule 10a-1 was the one that was banned.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/110614/why-short-selling-legal-brief-history.asp\n\nIn 2010, Rule 201 was instituted to reinstate the uptick rule but only if the price had fallen more than 10% in one day, and requiring only that the offer to sell be above the highest bid (which is easy to work around).  In name it supposedly allows the real owners of the shares to sell before the shorts, but in reality, the shorts had liberty to sell down the stock by 10%, whether or not the real share owners had already sold their shares at all.  \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/uptickrule.asp"

The selling prices right now are >$2200, above the $1600 MSRP and are currently unavailable for purchase anywhere for less than $2200. Furthermore from source [1], the 4090 was retailing at around $2000 US in the Asian markets but since launch, the price has started to hike up and currently sits at around $3000 US. At the same time, the demand for NVIDIA's H100 GPUs has shot up due to the upcoming China ban. The H100 PCIe accelerator which was available for $11,000 US is now selling for over $33,000$. The SXM version of the same GPU sells for even more but is much harder to come by. \\n\\nAlthough NVIDIA has suspended sales of their high-end AI GPUs in China, they have up till September 2023 to fulfill all current orders. Nvidia says that they are applying for expo\"",

     "I just bought parts to build a new computer yesterday. A new 3060 ti for $450 is what I went with. I have plenty of money, but I can't justify spending more than ~$800+ on a GPU. I think the prices are insane for Nvidia's cards and think they shot themselves in the foot. A 3060 ti is usually more than enough for 99% of games at 1080p, which is what most people are still on. \n\nI'll be surprised if they beat earnings. Very few people are buying 4090 GPUs, and people overall have less disposable income. \n\nThe only CPU/GPU company I think we will see clearly beat earnings is Intel. Their new 13th generation CPUs are arguably better for most use cases than AMD chips, and they cost quite a bit less than the AMD chips competing at each price point. \n\nAlso, apparently Intel Arc GPUs are selling fairly well, based on rumors. \n\nI'm biased against Nvidia right now though. They took advantage of the market when crypto was still gobbling up GPUs. Then the CEO says that \"Moore's law is dead\" to try to justify their 4000 series price gouging while they hold back lower tier 4000 series cards.\n\nFuck Nvidia."

Wall Street has become obsessed over its perceived exponential growth which will soon grind to a halt. You can only scale a model so much before you start to see diminishing returns. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has even stated that this is a huge problem and why a GPT 5 isnt being worked on at the moment. These LLMs also steal data and tend to hallucinate constantly. This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management.

Last time, I checked with their team, the bill was reduced to $300/month. \nSix years ago, at another startup, we published a podcast and we had a junior marketing guy who handled the audio files, upload it to all the platforms, create snippets for promotional purposes and handle the SEO for the podcast, it was pretty much his full time job. Now, you pay $50/month to a podcast platform and it does all that job and the junior marketing guys only spends a couple hours once every week promoting podcasts to increase the audience.

You know how many people put their minds together to analyze data and create micro services for management, sales reps and the like. There\u2019s plenty of other use such as in-house training courses, AI assistants to new hires and seniors. Basically fuck searching through 10 000 pages of knowledge-bases and courses. AI can standardize, it can correct and it can easily apply corporate governance. It can analyze performance based on metric data from Microsoft Viva, phone calls and sales etc. I guess my point is the data is already accessible and some poor soul probably goes through this shit on monthly reports showing KPI\u2019s and sales performances etc.. but why not have one corporate AI that just swings this all the time and constantly keep track, give feedback, proposals etc. \n\nThen I think there will be companies manufacturing employee AI\u2019s, basically training them for a specific role, could be a nurse, could be an IT operations person, could be a support agent, or any type of service job really. Now incorporate a bit of PAM & IAM for regulation purposes and to give the AI ways of executing tasks.

     "I can't really argue that there are some overvaluations happening as a result of the hype. \n\nBut it's pretty clear you don't understand the power of LLMs even a little. I can't say if the net jobs lost/gained will be positive or negative, but 300 million jobs totally changed, enhanced, or degraded by LLMs is very conservative.\n\nThe legal field will be one of the first to change. Just because some idiot asked chatGPT (a model trained for very general purposes, with no guarantee that any legal code or case law are even in the training set) about legal stuff and blindly trusted it means exactly nothing. I know of at least one company currently building an attributive LLM, ie a model trained on general purpose language, and then provide sources either from it's training set or database that support what it says. Imagine a legal assistant that can take a verbal description of a case or any situation, and spit out advice and information, for any jurisdiction, footnoted perfectly with sections of the law, relevant cases, sections of the contract being disputed, whatever helps make the case. Imagine this legal assistant can do this for any legal question every 5 seconds. \n\nThe job of lawyer is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but it will allow each lawyer to do 10 times the amount of work they did previously, at least. If the demand for legal services doesn't rise at the same pace as the cost to provide services tanks, many of the jobs will disappear and the wealth will concentrate upward to the few, lucky lawyers still operating with the help of LLMs.\n\nThat is just one example. Slight modifications and wrappers around the engine that is LLM technology will soon popup specialized to a variety of fields. What is possible with the technology we have even today, with no further advancements, will only be known when people start putting different components together in creative ways, but is obviously great.\n\nThat being said, it is difficult to know which company will strike the first huge success here and become the next Google of LLMs. It is possible that company has not even been founded yet, and likely they aren't available for the public to invest in. NVDA will do well selling shovels, but they aren't going to strike gold like a small number of software companies will.\n\nTLDR: Puts on tech"

     "People act as if AI is something new. Computer scientists have been working on this for decades. \n\nGenerative AI is sort of a phenomenon of a critical mass in hardware finally being achieved that is for the first time making generative AI doable at a reasonable cost and scale. It\u2019s a cool new application that people can experience first hand.\n\nBut what do you call facial recognition that Facebook has had for like ten years? How about credit card software that knows based on your spending history whether with 98% likelihood it is you making a purchase? Is that not also AI?\n\nThe reason every company is talking AI on earnings calls and in marketing materials is simply because they have to appear as if they are on the cutting edge. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is, they all follow each other. There\u2019s nothing new about it and it\u2019s a pattern that repeats over and over and over again.\n\nThis is what I think is getting lost in the debate about whether there\u2019s an AI bubble. The more compelling hardware and applications become the greater the investment in it will be. It\u2019s not a coincidence that nvda chips were used for video games then crypto mining and now for generative AI- as a new development progresses more and more applications of it take hold. I expect new and better application of generative AI to be developed. But I also expect additional uses of GPUs to be developed. We\u2019re seeing this now with AR/VR, autonomous vehicles, and much more. And it\u2019s only getting started.\n\nThink back to when Intel chips reached a similar tipping point around the mid nineties. What happened? You saw all sorts of unrelated applications of the technology- gaming, productivity, learning, communication, etc. What we are seeing now with Nvidia and a couple other chip makers is a similar tipping point that is going to usher in a sea change. I think it\u2019s very likely development of applications that tap into this power is going to ramp up exponentially and it\u2019s very possible Nvidia will eventually become the most valuable company in the world. Yes, others are also producing compelling hardware- Apple, AMD, Google, but each of those are at a disadvantage to Nvidia. But there will be lots of winners in this new field and I think a lot of amazing research is going to come over the next decade.\n\nTo me it\u2019s a lot like when they finally figured out the Bessemer process and then in ensuing years all sorts of unrelated things took off- railroads, bridges, high rise buildings, etc. which themselves were transformative. People aren\u2019t realizing that a lot of the crazes we\u2019ve seen recently are directly related to GPU development enabling them.\n\nBut labeling it all as AI is very misleading. It\u2019s probably more accurate to call the overall phenomenon something else. It\u2019d be like calling the Industrial Revolution \u201ca rail bubble\u201d."

     "Point taken and yes AI really needs better controls. Recall when the first Intel Pentium came out it had a bug that caused it to incorrectly calculate. This was in the field for months before anyone actually noticed the erroneous results in their spreadsheets and databases. Companies lost money because of the error.   I feel the same will happen with AI. The expectations are so high an not  too many people understand how to validate results. \n\nThat said AI is not new - its over 60 years in development. What is new is the hardware (Tensocores) that accelerate it and the ability to use many of them to create large models became commoditized and not lab experiments.  It will make the average PC user a power user. It will take repetitive tasks, learn how you do them, and create much faster workflows. It will make all data available to all programs by being able to translate, merge and clean heterogenous datasets on the fly.   This is HUGE.  With the Internet over 80% of a companies data comes from external sources. For home users it is over 93%.  \n\nStated another way - The Macintosh was revered for making computing easy to use. AI is the next step - making computing fully adaptive to the user.   And of course AI is the core of robotics and automation advances."

Trying to find light through the darkness is difficult, but it's such a powerful trait.\n\nI had a drug problem growing up. I got clean when my kids were born in 2001. I built two businesses and sold them and had more money than I knew what to do with (and had zero skills to manage it). I relapsed in 2005 during a divorce and went to prison in 2008. I lost the last quarter of my 20s, several years of my life, all my money, everyone forgot about me, and I felt like my life was over.\n\nI was 31 when I got out, and I had $800 to my name. It took my several years to rebuild, but I did. I not only rebuilt, but I rebuilt to levels well beyond where I was in my 20s. In the end though, what I am grateful for every day is the fact that I have a roof over my head, food to eat, and my freedom.\n\nBeing grateful for the things you have and learning from mistakes instead of feeling sorry for yourself about the things you've lost is powerful, and a key to future success. I wish you the best of luck, and I am confident with that mentality you will succeed."

  "Text": "b\"Nvidia launched new GPUs on Oct 12 and the top model 4090 is literally (!) melting cables because the adapter or connector can't handle the power draw. It's currently all over the nvidia subreddit and you can see some pictures of burned adapters. It does seem to be a systemic issue. Sometimes the GPUs is also damaged, sometimes it's fine. Anyone's guess if it's just the pci-e power adapter or the connector too. I'm seeing lots of angry customers that bought $1600 GPUs that might now go up in flames. Seems there was abysmal quality control and they rushed the launch.\\n\\nMore importantly, there isn't any official news or statement from nvidia yet (as far as I can see, please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm sure some nvidia engineers are shitting their pants right now though.\\n\\nAnyway I'm thinking this can't be good for their stock price, so be prepared for a green dildo out of nowhere.\\n\\nThoughts?\"",

The reason GPU's were used in the first place is somebody noticed they can do mindless repetitive calculations without expensive CPU's. Last year, using GPU's for bitcoin 'mining' became unprofitable. The way bitcoin 'mining' works is the 'nuggets' get more scarce as more are mined. The GPU initial price plus the electricity and cooling costs were more than the bitcoins mined. All the cryptocurrency 'farms' were switching to banks of ASIC's this year. The GPU consumer market is going to go back to gamers and AI supercomputers. The one growing market is computer graphics requiring CUDA is growing fast in multiple areas beyond digital video studios.

Look for a local business you get 3 ads, then 1 or 2 map ads, then organics. Which is all I care about. What actually ranks for a search, not who paid the most. Google got greedy and is hurting their product. Breaking ads away would a) make a hugely profitable company that could be laser focused on improving the search/ad experience and b) let google be the cloud/AI/communications company it is set up to be."

     "In the financial world what you just posted is actually illegal according to both SEC and NASAA rules. \n\nThe reason being is because it gives the illusion of success. \n\nHowever, we must list all performance not in the last year and all winners and losers, net gains, and for a specific time frame. \n\nThe entirety of the stock market has traded flat for the first 6 months of the year barring 6-8 high moving stocks that make up all growth across all sectors and markets. These stocks now hold weight of some 30-40% in all of the indexs. The whole point of an index is for it be equal weight so that if apple posts a missed revenue and weak guidance and drops 30% that it doesn't tank growth for the next 3 years on your index fund investments. \n\nAlmost every other stock in the market including real money makers that have solid balance sheets and recession proof products or services are trading 40% lower than they were a year ago. \n\nSo there are two big points to make here. \n\n1. You cherry picked data and used recent massive run ups in the last 3-4 weeks as your primary data source to say we are going to continue to go up. Which is stupid but also would be illegal if you were in finance. \n\n2. It's ironic that you don't realize the statement you just made is the perfect illustration as to why we will crash a good 20-30% and it's going to be almost entirely the stocks you just mentioned. \n\nNvidia is trading at 200 times its earnings. In a normal market with the absolute highest potential growth a PE ratio should never exceed 80-90. 80 quarters is 20 years. That's fucking insane. A normal PE ratio for a good growth company and solid balance sheet is normally 24. \n\nTesla at 64\nMicrosoft at 36\nApple at 30\nGoogle at 28 \n\n\nSo you can see how Google, apple and Microsoft are way closer to that normal PE ratio and have huge fortresses of a balance sheet. If they take a haircut of 10% each they'll be at market value. Because those 3 have a weight of close to 15% of the spy, the spy will take a haircut to about 385. When Tesla and Nvidia come back to earth, that's what you're gonna see spy hit 350s. This all assumes the rest of the market stays flat. Which of course it won't. \n\n\nWe are in the fomo greed cycle at the very end before a big hit. Stay cash and get ready to play the ups and downs for the next year."

If the vote passes stocks go up if the vote doesnt pass stocks will go down because everyone is going to sell their bets. \\n\\nNancis husband has already bought a ton of NVDA stock. That means that the vote will most likely pass. \\n\\nNow this is some crystal clear shit. Any boomer looking at the news can see this this trade which means that we will probably see a gap up on Monday for NVDA. \\n\\nHowever a lot of traders especially retirement fund institutions will probably wait until the vote comes through to buy into this stock which means that we arent technically too late to the party. \\n\\nSo my question is whats the move on Monday. Do I keep it basic and buy shares. Full send with some OTM calls. Keep it lax with ATM calls or keep is conservative with some 2 month out debit spreads ?'",

If you didn't listen to the earnings call, you can absolutely hear the fear in their voices. That bullshit about not knowing how many GPUs are being used for mining vs gaming is a lie. GPUs used for gaming require gaming drivers. These drivers have to be updated. GPUs sold - Drivers = Mining GPUs. While this may not be dead balls accurate, it is accurate enough to know whether you have a problem or not. They have that data, they just won't share it. Nvidia has problems that they are not being transparent about. Their flagship GPU is selling for 50% of MSRP and its replacement will require a 1200 watt power supply and likely have a $2500-$3000 MSRP, maybe more.  While I do not think that Nvidia is going to collapse, I do think we will see two more quarters of fucked up earnings calls. Nvidia is a $150 stock."

Or, if you can day trade, go with the momentum first, then consider swinging. Check around 30 min after market opens and wait for a Hammer (bullish), Rejection of a good resistance level (bearish), or wedges. Remember to use QQQ for reference \n\nI mostly missed it today, but if you check QQQ around 10:01 AM (or 7:01 if you live in the west coast like me), QQQ began creating a falling wedge pattern. The hammer candle followed by the green candle at 10:27, and then the breakout of the wedge was super bullish. Most of my funds didn't clear, but I got a super cheap contract and still made around 120% profit.\n\n\n___\n\nTomorrow, look for premarket levels, chart them on tradingview or webull, and just watch for what happens. The goal is to daytrade the momentum first, then if you want to take a chance, try swinging a contract or open up a straddle/strangle\n\nI want to swing a call, but... Well, I got burned on Tesla earnings pretty badly, so I'm not very confident in what the outcome will be\n\nSorry for the long explanation, but Godspeed \ud83d\udc4d"

     "Let me clarify a few things.  Heading into 2023 the bull case = earnings will exceed estimates and stocks outperform, base case= earnings meet or modestly undershoot estimates stock remains range bound and bear case= earnings estimates undershoot estimates massively and stocks re-rate with a lower multiple.  Through q1 bull case played out to a T.  And if you look at earnings estimates across the board for 2024, base case estimates are for earnings to be up 15% vs 2023.  Stocks will front run this by 6-9 months and the bear case has imploded due to earnings coming in much stronger than expected and avoiding the dreaded double dip.  Tech stocks driving the markets is not a new narrative and 70% of s and p 500 return over last 10 years is from less than 10 stocks.  So this isn\u2019t new, it isn\u2019t abnormal and due to market cap weighting stronger earnings from megacap tech has an outsized impact on overall s and p 500 earnings.  So your point about lack of breadth is really it relevant in the context of the market.  Buybacks from big cap, Google, meta, apple and Microsoft also create a strong buoy of buying pressure that is limiting volatility and create a low volume rally year to date.  As it relates to interest rates, you don\u2019t really understand what rates the market is focused on when determining equity risk premium, aka premium stocks trade to bond vs cash.  That multiple is driven by interest rates but also by earnings growth not just trailing multiples and if you look at longer term rates ten year, 30 year, they are off from high at 4.4% to 3.5% currently and 4.3% to 3.8%.  The myopic view you are looking at is the remedial optic someone who isn\u2019t in the business looks at which is fed funds rate.  We have an inverted yield curve and longer term rates peaked last fall and heading lower as inflation forecasts continue to weaken in tandem with macro economic weakness being priced in to future cuts in fed funds rate.  Market is front running this, and stocks aren\u2019t expensive, they are very reasonably priced and will re-rate higher as we head into a cutting and easing cycle.

That means that the sales will be higher then when I would not have bought the gpu. Now people dont know i bought the gpu before this post, so the sales will be higher, and the revenue will be higher then when i did not buy the gpu. Hence, the stock will go up after earnings report cause i bought said gpu. \\n\\nTLDR: I bought rx 6700 gpu so i think stock will go up. Trust me.'",
