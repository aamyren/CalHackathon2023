The company is negotiating with Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Dish Network Corp. to get the lowest possible wholesale prices. That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.\\n\\nThe talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said. Dish shares jumped 14% Friday in New York since a deal with the retail giant could help the struggling satellite-TV company as it transitions to become a national wireles'",

After the revenue sharing agreement was signed around 2004, Yahoo put a bunch of crap on their news pages making them almost impossible to view with deal-up internet access. Users complained that Yahoo was too slow but the complaints were ignored by everyone.  People in the know positioned their investments to make money from growth in telecoms that provide DSL and growth in better web sites such as Google or Facebook.\n\nI really doubt Amazon is going to cave and share a big part of their revenue with the big telecoms."

It means that if you are maker of the base stations, you won't know who/what the clients are talking about.\n\nHowever, as a core network, the visibility is much higher. For example, core network can issue measurement request to get user's GPS coordinates. It can also read your DNS requests, which means they know what site you were trying to access and so on. The rest of the traffic is likely to be encrypted anyway.\n\nThe thing is, the legacy providers were sitting on top of those data for years without the capability to analyze those data as it's not what they are good at doing. But Amazon is a tech giant with real capabilities to understand and analyze it. And it's not a particular good company to share private information like this with. \n\nIt's also the reason why I don't want to sign up for Google Fi. But in my opinion, google is far less evil than Amazon. \n\nSo, yeah, if you are concern with your privacy, maybe stick with Ryan Reynolds a bit longer.

Additionally, they will gradually acquire additional market share, even venturing into industries such as automotive, as seen with Apple and Google. They will eagerly invest in promising startups, employing any means necessary to eliminate competition and establish dominance. With abundant financial resources and exceptional intellect, they possess the ability to expand continuously. And they will be overvalued too if not already.\\n\\nYet I'm slowly moving my portfolio to have more and more these stocks. I'm curious what percentages of your portfolio are allocated in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT? \\nIgnore the portions in your ETFs.\\n(I understand index fund is the way but may be that's not for me)\"",

     "Buying the biggest companies in the world has historically not been a winning strategy over the long term, no matter how impenetrable their moats are at the moment. (I'm sure someone will share that graphic of the top market cap companies over time) The amount of runway for $1T, $2T companies just doesn't compare to what is possible with $500M, $10B market cap companies. I don't want to just buy the past winners, but buy the future ones. This is why the core strategy of my portfolio are large tilts to small cap (value) stocks, which is both riskier but also has higher rewards in the long run. They are also a hedge when big tech hits a wall, like happened post-Dot Com. [Take a look at 2000-1](https://i.imgur.com/xIpUKyL.png) in this table of small cap value versus the broader market in down years.\n\nI like buying big tech 'tactically', as they do have rock solid balance sheets and moats, so when they do dip (irrationally), I buy them. This rewarded me greatly in 2022, as I doubled down on \n\n- GOOG (+25%, 2% of port.)\n- META (+60%, 2.6% of port.)\n- MSFT (+17%, 2.8% of port.)\n- AAPL (+19%, 1.9% of port.)\n- SMH (+24%, 1.4% of port)\n- AMD (+12%, 2.5% of port.)\n\nYes I didn't time the bottom perfectly or I'd be much richer. I had opened up positions on these in 2021-2, and either averaged down from expensive levels or bought when I felt was too cheap. AMD/MSFT were among my worst timed purchases. But these are not necessarily long term holds since I already have exposure through index funds and I think they are fairly to over-valued now."

This is a tiny acquisition at $1.7 Billion of a company that was already in decline due to competition. Sure Amazon already has an arsenal of at-home appliances collecting data, but specifically the smart vacuum space was already a race to the bottom. iRobot has no prospects outside of this deal. Compare that to the $70 Billion acquisition of Activision, which would be in the top 10 largest acquisitions of all time, and Microsoft is already a massive player in digital entertainment. This would be a huge consolidation. I don't understand how people thought the Activision deal would be a safer bet than the iRobot deal. That's not to say that the Activision deal won't go through, maybe the U.K. decision gets appealed or something. I was heavily buying IRBT in the mid and low $30s. It was a fat pitch IMO."

     "The memo (also included in the article):\n\nAs we\u2019ve just concluded the second phase of our operating plan (\u201cOP2\u201d) this past week, I\u2019m writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks\u2014mostly in AWS, PXT, Advertising, and Twitch. This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.\nLet me share some additional context.\nAs part of our annual planning process, leaders across the company work with their teams to decide what investments they want to make for the future, prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. For several years leading up to this one, most of our businesses added a significant amount of headcount. This made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole. However, given the uncertain economy in which we reside, and the uncertainty that exists in the near future, we have chosen to be more streamlined in our costs and headcount. The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers\u2019 lives and Amazon as a whole. \nAs our internal businesses evaluated what customers most care about, they made re-prioritization decisions that sometimes led to role reductions, sometimes led to moving people from one initiative to another, and sometimes led to new openings where we don\u2019t have the right skills match from our existing team members. This initially led us to eliminate 18,000 positions (which we shared in January); and, as we completed the second phase of our planning this month, it led us to these additional 9,000 role reductions (though you will see limited hiring in some of our businesses in strategic areas where we\u2019ve prioritized allocating more resources).\nSome may ask why we didn\u2019t announce these role reductions with the ones we announced a couple months ago. The short answer is that not all of the teams were done with their analyses in the late fall; and rather than rush through these assessments without the appropriate diligence, we chose to share these decisions as we\u2019ve made them so people had the information as soon as possible. The same is true for this note as the impacted teams are not yet finished making final decisions on precisely which roles will be impacted. Once those decisions have been made (our goal is to have this complete by mid to late April), we will communicate with the impacted employees (or where applicable in Europe, with employee representative bodies). We will, of course, support those we have to let go, and will provide packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, and external job placement support.\nIf I go back to our tenet\u2014being leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers\u2019 lives and Amazon as a whole\u2014I believe the result of this year\u2019s planning cycle is a plan that accomplishes this objective. I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have, both in our largest businesses, Stores and AWS, and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we\u2019re investing.\nTo those ultimately impacted by these reductions, I want to thank you for the work you have done on behalf of customers and the company. It\u2019s never easy to say goodbye to our teammates, and you will be missed. To those who will continue with us, I look forward to partnering with you as we make life easier for customers every day and relentlessly inventing to do so.\nAndy"

     "America's strength is in being able to hire and fire people. Amazon hired an immense amount of people during Corona crisis when my Nordic country was shut down and massive unemployment and issues. That is the true \"trickle down\" that keeps working, but many lazy people think it always meant free money for doing nothing... It's the opportunities that assist people in rising up in the economy.\n\nIn my country, worker protection is so absurd that hiring the first person for your company is an absurd gamble.\n\nYou can not get rid of a bad hire, you can be on the hook for years if the worker is a real asshole. They can claim sickness constantly after passing recruitment, and milk the company dry. \n\nYou can fake sickness for years and the company can not fire you anywhere near a reported sickness, or you can take them to court or complain to a union which is more than happy to bankrupt small companies on legal costs... Even if you are in the right, you need huge amounts of money to get justice.\n\nThere's many cases of small startups being bankrupted by essentially welfare trolls. It's horrible and I would never employ anyone personally, despite starting my career as such a first hire. That's why we have a growing subcontracting culture now to avoid the socialism.\n\nYouth unemployment in the 20% range is normal and accepted here, young people with lacking experience can't find work because of the extreme risk involved."

     "eBay was for the longest time an auction site. People that liked it, loved it. Everyone else, hated it. The buy it now and offer it options later helped, but I\u2019ve had 4 friends between the ages of 25-35 ask me to buy something for them still in recent years as they don\u2019t get it. Sure all the random basement crap from my folks, grandma, Sears catalogs, kids stuff and new old stock floppy disks sell well on there but folks don\u2019t think new and current stuff. I buy lawn carburetor kits, bags, guards, belts, shop vac bags, knockoff batteries, extra drills, parts all the time on there. Most folks don\u2019t. Sometimes the prices are nuts, you have to filter off outside the US sometimes, doing math on free shipping or paying for shipping plus good price is hard for folks. Amazon makes it idiot proof. They pulled away with the 2 day shipping (eBay it\u2019s on the seller and they\u2019re (even me) picking the cheapest snail mail for whichever party is paying. Folks get off on instant gratification. They can\u2019t wait for a week. My buddy loves Amazon and I\u2019ve seen him pay more for grocery/Target stuff than what other stores sell it for. He doesn\u2019t know better nor care. eBay folks still want a deal. Also, I\u2019m not buying food and household staples there, it would be Amazon. Powersports and auto people love eBay, that\u2019s not Amazon\u2019s strong suit. eBay doesn\u2019t cater well to the volume stuff either. I really hate Amazon as I find it confusing with too many options, eBay has a much better search feature (Amazon does Oz voodoo crap making it impossible to see more than a few hits and filter/sort). eBay moved from auctions too late and Amazon revolutionized retail and expectations with 2 day shipping. Add in you\u2019re not comparing seller ratings, Amazon won long term."

     "As someone who uses both the products and is invested in both the stocks, the 2 e-commerce platforms are fundamentally different. Ebay operates more like an independent platform without their own skin in the game, which has its pros and cons. \nWhereas amazon controls all parts of its e commerce experience: platform, warehousing, supply chain, and logistics. \n\nOne of the major cons for eBay is inconsistent user experience when buying from different sellers. Whereas a main pro is they don\u2019t have added cost of maintaining logistics services and warehouses all over the country. \n\nAmazon is a huge huge company with lots of other businesses (AWS being their main cash cow). So they have the freedom to afford lower profit margins in their e-commerce business. Ebay on the other hand is only an e-commerce marketplace. I have not checked the recent numbers, but if you compare just their e-commerce platforms, eBay\u2019s percentage profit will come up higher than amazon e-commerce.\n\nAddition after reading other comments: contrary to the popular belief, you can find great first hand products on eBay as well. Ensure you check the seller\u2019s past ratings to see if they are good. And similar to prime, ebay has ebay money back guarantee, for cases when you don\u2019t like the product and the seller is not listening to your concern. In such cases, after a few days, ebay will step in and refund the buyer and ding the seller later."

I mean, Amazon was always the big dog in the e-commerce game, but I remember when eBay was giving them a run for their money. It's just kind of sad to see how far behind they fell.\n\nI think part of the problem was that eBay just didn't have the same level of ambition as Amazon. Amazon was always looking to expand and take over the world, while eBay seemed content with just being a smaller player in the game. And, you know, when you're playing against someone who's trying to be the biggest and the best, it's hard to keep up.\n\nBut, you know, it's not like eBay didn't have the chance to be a big player. They just didn't take it. I mean, they had the platform and the user base, but they just didn't have the same drive as Amazon. And that's really what it comes down to, I think.\n\nAnyway, it's definitely interesting to see how these two companies grew so far apart. I guess it just goes to show that ambition and drive are really important in the business world."

     "People overestimate Amazon. This isn't the same Amazon from five years ago when they looked like they were on the verge of total domination.\n\n1. They have their hands on too many projects. Good/bad thing. Good if you can scale it. Bad if it's taking forever and you're losing money in the hopes of it one day reaching the market.\n2. People have been talking about Amazon's R&D eventually coming to fruition for years now. Sorry, but some of their shit have been absolute failures. Drone delivery, how's that going? They tried to get into video game development and failed miserably with a long-term project losing money and not having enough players. I can't remember the other projects they had that ultimately were scrapped but there are many of them.\n3. E-commerce is highly competitive and low margins. That's why Amazon has had trouble with it lately. Walmart and other retailers have become very competitive in improving shipping times, prices, and item availability. I used to make Amazon orders like twice a week. I'm barely even touching my Amazon account these days. If I didn't have it for free, I would never pay. Increased labor costs, increased transportation costs, supply constraints... all have reduced Amazon's margins.\n4. AWS is a positive but cloud is highly competitive with large players willing to spend billions to compete here and growth has slowed. I think AWS is like 15% of Amazon's revenue but represented 75% of their profit. That is more negative than positive. It's unlike Apple where services is high margins but at the heart of the company, their hardware is still insanely profitable. Again, e-commerce is tough business and Amazon is finding that out now. It's too late for them to ditch it so can they find a way to be more profitable with huge retailers capable of giving them a battle?\n5. Internationally, they haven't had too much success. Difficult to replicate in foreign countries because the logistics is far more challenging when you're competing against domestic companies.\n\nPositives, services revenue is bigger than sales revenue so higher margins and less dependability on their e-commerce. Operating margins have been increasing after a terrible two years so that's a good sign. Ad services have been huge for Amazon. They should really take advantage of that. Huge growth and they have the means to scale. Large consumer base, easy target.\n\nBig issue is: Too much money being used up on projects that haven't really made any money and investors want results now. Especially when cash is hard to come by because of the rates, you can't be burning cash flow on projects that may or may not work. That's why Apple is still the cream of the crop. They are printing money whether anyone likes it or not."

They are far from 100% of the phone/pc/device market, and there are still ways they can capture more revenue from its users from the app store, fintech, streaming media, and so on.

     "Out of those three I would say Microsoft. Best diversification, best moat, and has segments that are crucial to government operations meaning it\u2019s backed by the government to the extent of they won\u2019t let Microsoft fail. Apple is very dependent on hardware sales since that is how they get users into their ecosystem. And as for their hardware comparable alternatives are available creating some risk there. All it takes is a few missteps on the hardware side for Apple to crack. Amazon e-commerce is low margin but they do have AWS which is high margin.  Overall amazons success weighs heavy on AWS. Amazon does have data on users like shopping habits and previous purchases to help drive ad sales. Microsoft products are heavily integrated into most people lives to the point where there is no real comparable alternative and these offerings are through so many different segments. This is why I would say Microsoft is the strongest of the three. As for the mega cap with the biggest upside I would say alphabet as of right now. They have multiple growth segments like cloud, AI, driverless tech, healthcare, search, YouTube, and so much more. On top of it they are trading at the lowest valuation of all the mega caps right now. But to the original question Microsoft for sure in my opinion."

Earnings will be a big decider of that and since MSFT has announced a layoff, I'm pretty sure their quarter announcement will be bad since I've never heard of a company announcing positive earnings and a layoff at the same time.  I'm avoiding Amazon until Jassey can finish cutting all the costs that Besos implemented. AMZN needs to go to at least $60 for the valuation to make sense.\n\nAll of these numbers might take forever and I'm willing to wait.\n\nThe one that is the closest on a valuation level, for me, is actually GOOGL at a 19/20 PE.  Fair value is only about $10 lower than it's at right now, and again, another great company.  I think I'll be investing in GOOGL before the others solely based on valuation and how fast the stocks get to fair value."

Advertising is one of their most recent venture in 2019, not much information was given on it but seems like cash for basically no additional costs. \n\nWord of caution for AMZN though, AMZN has been in negative free cash flows for the past 2 years. Reason given by management is because they\u2019ve doubled their network focusing more on growth, profits later. If you like their mantra you could consider digging more into AMZN\n\nAs for GOOG, 80% of their revenue comes from advertising. Advertising is a cyclical business. Meaning when the economy tanks, GOOG goes down with it as well.\n\nThe good thing about GOOG is that it\u2019s a software company so the main bulk of cost should come from R&D there shouldn\u2019t be very high costs required to maintain the servers, so once products get through GOOG just has to wait on cash to flow in, their margins have been consistently 20+% for the past 5-6 years compared to AMZN\u2019s 2-5% iirc.\n\nThe most exciting thing for GOOG is that it\u2019s looking to break into different modal for search. If tech is more of your thing GOOG would probably be your best bet.\n\nI know you asked about AAPL, MSFT and AMZN but I haven\u2019t had a look at AAPL and MSFT so Iwouldn\u2019t want to feed you misinformation."

Titans like MSFT and AMZN laying off employees looks embarrassing to me. \n\nFull disclosure - I own all three companies, however I own about 10 times as much apple as I do the others."

     "Consider this an assessment more of how these stock tickers will do, not how good the companies are, or their businesses are...\n\nAAPL is not down that much, nor is MSFT.\n\nBut AMZN stock certainly has been pummelled.  They've been recently hated as a company and a stock.  That typically is a setup for a strong bounce.\n\nWe've seen it over and over.  Facebook was getting daily coverage for their evils, their idiot owner tripled down on \"metaverse\" and then the stock cratered.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.  They didn't change or fix anything.  They just waited for the spotlight to move.\n\nTesla was ludicrously overvalued, and has a psychotic fascism cheerleader and Russian puppet owner.  Product quality tanked along with reputation, and there's strong competition everywhere.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.\n\nNvidia hit a chip glut and people realized a lot of their business was from selling wildly overpriced silicon for unsustainable crypo.  Yet it's had a 100% rebound on... nothing, really.\n\nNetflix was mismanaged and hid the fact they hit customer saturation years ago and price saturation too.  Their desperate response was to call customers thieves for doing password sharing NFLX had always encouraged, then an incompetent money-losing ad-tier launch which, at best, cannibalizes themselves for low value customers and negative revenue.  Shady execs now pledging to hide the subscriber numbers.  Stock is up 150%.\n\nSo while I don't have confidence in Amazon to fix their business problems (like how most of their site and experience is just displaying datafeed entries of third party offshore knockoff junk and counterfeit product inserted into their broken fulfillment structure) I would say that if it's anything like how the other floundering large \"tech\" companies have seen their stock price go parabolic without reason, they're in the best position for senseless rebound."

AWS is stamped as a backbone of the internet but that is only alleviating the mess that their biggest operating cost which is eCommerce is doing.

     "yes I do I bought last week at the \"current lows\", expecting a short term rallye (worked), but also for longterm. \n\nMain points for me: AMZN as a business is just one of those giants that are a giant for a reason, and the need for that will stay for a prolonged time. They have all the infrastructure and network behind it, etc. Also we can add AWS which is still early and a sector that might has a tougher time right now as businesses cannot spend as much, but longterm it\u00b4s a huge thing as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow for the overall situation, I also bought other stuff, for 2 key reasons:\n\n1) Contrarian approach: Crowd was insanley bearish recently, when many tickers were at their absolut lowest point in quite a long time, people went and sold their shares after bagholding and started to buy puts, banks called for recession and doom, etc. Basically they all were behind before the rate hikes / inflation , now they almost certainly will be again.\n\n2) A lot of data tells me that a soft landing after being a bit of a meme, might be what we will get, or at least, we most certainly will not see a crazy recession or crash, as businesses adapted, the market also adapted and the overall economy is really strong right now (given the circumstances).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHence why for a stock like AMZN, I think we got an asymmetric situation, chances that it bottoms here/ has bottomed, and has high returns going forward are much higher, than us dropping a lot lower. And as any smart investor would do, if you have interest in it but just wanna take a little less risk, buy 50% of your position, if we get this \"recession scenario\", you can adjust."

Over time, smaller, more agile competitors start to break off parts of your business that they can do more efficiently with less bloat, or to serve segments of your market with specialized services that a generalized player can't profitably offer. Amazon has been brilliant in defending this eventuality so far, but eventually, it catches up with every company. I see a lot more opportunities for incremental erosion in their business than exponential growth."

The share of US ad revenues held by Facebooks parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024.

     "Probably not a lot of marketers chiming in here, I have over 20 years in the digital marketing space so I'll add some clarity. \n\n1.) Google will NEVER lose search market share, not in the traditional sense. The way you search today, if still applicable in 100 years, will belong to Google. The caveat, of course, is that people stop searching (googling) and start asking AI questions instead, BUT Google actually has the edge there as well with internal AI (not yet public)   \n\n\nSince search ads are the #1 driver of revenue you might be concerned that TikTok or Amazon or Apple are going to take away search market share, and that's just not going to happen...  \n\n\nUnless. Apple bundles an AI search solution on iOS that rivals or beats Google. Think the buzz that Siri had years ago, but actually helpful. That would MURDER Google's marketshare. \n\n...but, as we've seen (with Maps & Email) just bundling a solution doesn't mean users won't gravitate towards the better Google solution. \n\nWhich brings up one last point. Google owning Android gives them 50% automatic marketshare. So, it's really that last 50% of mobile (iOS) that they have to protect. \n\nAll that needs to be said about Google vs. anyone else is that Google has search, and as long as Google has search they have the absolute highest intent ad clicks on Earth. Why? People are searching for a solution and able to find it. \n\nFacebook doesn't allow this. \n\nApple allows this in an app setting (such as finding apps) but you can't just get an insurance quote or a loan. \n\nTikTok doesn't allow this. \n\nAmazon doesn't allow offsite traffic.\n\nDesktop search is going nowhere, either. Computer users will still use Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) TikTok. Here's the thing. It's a terrible advertising platform for us marketers. Creative (i.e. ad assets) are almost ephemeral in the sense the little twats using TikTok have about 3.5 second attention span. Ads go stale in days, not months. \n\nThis means advertisers will use it, but lose more often than win. It's kind of like 15+ years ago when Google rolled out the Google Display Network (GDN) which Adsense is based on. Everyone thought it was this massive new ad platform that will offset high search ad costs. Nope, it was just trash traffic for the most part. \n\nThat's TikTok. There's money to be made, but you're basically doing drive-by's on bored young adults that want to see someone with no bra jumping rope. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) Amazon. They are a very real threat to retail ad budgets. That's for sure. That's not going to stop people from advertising on Google or FB (especially for ad retargeting outside of the Amazon platform); but ad dollars and ad dollars, right? If you allocate more to Amazon because you sell on Amazon, it makes sense. \n\nWhich brings up another point. To use it you need to sell on Amazon! That cuts out a lot of Fortune 500 advertisers and doesn't really scoop up much high-CPC marketshare of industries like financial products, which make up the majority of Google's search ad revenue. \n\nUnfortunately, Amazon DOES have AWS (vs. Google Cloud) so if you're looking at this holistically as a business, Amazon has a LOT more going for them across multiple fronts. \n\n...but again, this shouldn't impact native search marketshare and Amazon does not drive traffic offsite, so that's a big no to 3rd party ads. \n\n4.) Then there's Apple. This company represents the #1 threat to Google's ad marketshare. As I stated earlier, simply bundling an AI search solution and selling ads would drastically cut into Google's search ad revenue IF Google didn't have a competing product. \n\nApple has something like 50% marketshare on mobile, so you can't discount what they have the ability to do with their device base (same with Google's Android) \n\nAs an advertiser do I care about Apple right now? Yes and no. \n\nNo because it only matters if you offer an app as a primary product, and a lot of the companies I work with don't (though, 1 does and we almost exclusively use Apple) and for obvious reasons, the Android version of apps aren't allowed to be advertised. \n\nApple's ad system is also pretty terrible. You can't drive traffic to a landing page offsite, everything goes straight to the download page. Great if you want app downloads, but also not that great if you want to tailor your message. \n\nI see a future where Apple certainly controls a lot of overall ad budgets since they have the mobile ecosystem (just like Google does) + higher quality users; but this shouldn't cut into Google's current revenue stream by much. \n\nThese are 2 very different products with VERY different intent as explained previously. Google traffic is super high intent and that's because people are looking for a solution across endless topics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.) Lastly, there's Facebook. As an advertiser I've given up on them. All is not well with FB. I would NOT purchase stock in their company unless I believe in their version of the Metaverse, because ads are no longer a consideration. \n\nThat says a lot. I've made millions advertising on Facebook. I would absolutely love nothing more than to continue advertising on FB for the rest of my life. There's no point. Apple killed them when they eliminated the ability to get attribution, and then FB killed themselves with Cambridge and FTC issues to the point they had to basically eliminate all of their great targeting options. \n\nFacebook has 3 massive problems. \n\n1.) It's too expensive. Costs on par with Google. \n\n2.) It has far lower quality and intent. People aren't searching, they're interrupted with an ad. \n\n3.) Attribution is basically gone. Who clicked what and who converted? Fuck if I know!\n\nFacebook in its current iteration stands absolutely no chance at taking Google's marketshare for anything but consumer lawsuits. IF the metaverse becomes of a thing and FB controls that, well, then, they're the biggest thing in the world, right? Can't refute that. \n\nBut, think about it. There's a reason Zuck pivoted so hard. He knows he lost the ad game and it's just a matter of time. Thanks to Apple, they can't fix their attribution problems so he has to create his own fucking world to monetize. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nIn closing. Will Google lose marketshare? Probably not. Maybe to Apple. Still probably not."

Amazon's growth stalled out in the middle of 2021, and it posted its first loss in seven years at the beginning of 2022.

Estimates in new reports range from **10,000 to 20,000 people who will lose their Amazon jobs in the coming months,** but that's just the most recent glimpse of trouble.

     "A few counter points (I don\u2019t own any shares of amazon yet). \n\n\nAmazons posted loss is highly due to reinvestment into R&D and their projects. They invest a lot into new projects and don\u2019t mind admitting when it fails. You stated an example of a failure later with amazon brick and mortar stores. But they can afford multiple failures, because the winners will make way more than the losers. Example here AWS.\n\n\n\nAmazon still has 38% market share in e-commerce (Walmart has 6.5%). AWS had 32% market share and that\u2019s still a growing industry. The market share is important. In tough economic times this will help them stay ahead of competitors. They\u2019ll only end up more ahead when the economy rights itself. \n\n\nThey\u2019re laying off 10-20000 employees? Out of the 1,544,000 that\u2019s only 0.65-1.3% of the workforce. To be fair only about 330,000 employees are in corporate/tech that the fore mentioned lay offs talks about. So that\u2019s closer to 3%, which is still a nothing burger. They\u2019re still actively hiring in some of their up and coming investments. If anything it\u2019s a good thing because they\u2019re cutting costs in areas that it won\u2019t really affect. \n\n\n\nAmazon has its hands in so many pies that a lot of people are unaware of. Personally I\u2019m interested in their dive into healthcare, my wife recently started working on the pharmacy team. She\u2019s worked for many other large pharmacies (think CVS and some hospitals). She\u2019s constantly telling me how much better Amazons process is, primarily just being more efficient and less demanding to work at. I also hear similar reviews from me engineer and CS friends who work there. \n\n\nThey also recently announced the launch of drone delivery. Which they got FAA approval for in 2020. This could also be interesting since it may allow for more rural deliveries and potential long term cost cutting on labor. Also I doubt the FAA will allow everyone and their mother to have their own drone delivery, so could be some potential high market share in that space in the long term. \n\n\n\nOverall I\u2019m not invested because my wife will be getting a lot of RSU and I don\u2019t want too much weight in Amazon. But before she got the job I was seriously eyeing them at this price point."

Our family does almost all our non-grocery shopping from Amazon or Costco. Its also what most internet services runs on. They've also grown to be one of the top digital advertising platforms. I have no Amazon stock as my large cap ETFs already hold enough of them. They've crushed mom and pop stores that will never recover from the pandemic and now they can increase prices to meet whatever requirements the finance pundits or stock holders desire. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid they really have a loss or was it accounting practices for their Rivian stock?"

     "Amazon is not one entity.  They have among other lines\n\n1. The retail side of the house (Whole foods for example).  Small but there.\n2. The eCommerce side of the house (the warehouses, systems, aircraft, delivery trucks).  \n3. They have the AWS side of the house (the dominant cloud provider), and a gigantic pwoerhouse\n4. The content creation and delivery ( including original and distributed content in films, music, and delivery devices Alexa, Kindle).  \n5. The have hands in other pies (EV's through Rivian, though they took a loss on that).\n6. Many other business that the are in even today being worked through the incubator\n7. Data and profiles.  Every time you buy something on Amazon, it is recorded, I can find every order of mine since the 90's.  Personal data is a gold mine\n\nThey have a supply chain (designing goods, getting them manufactured in China, transporting, warehousing, and getting it to your door).  Other parts (the distributing, they offer to others as a service, the middleman).  AWS is now actually designing their own chips and selling/leasing hardware including networking gear.  They provide a variety of Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings.  They are not afraid to go where others don't (Rekognition the facial recognition software to the police and others, Google is more hesitant about that)\n\nSo I am not as concerned about that some segments are growing less than others, but more about the ability of the management to run disparate business profitably.   Warren Buffet puts professional managers and manages at the portfolio level.  Amazon on the other hand is more tightly coupled.  Bezos was capable of holding everything together.  Can his successor do the same?\n\nAmazon may be an good example of where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, that they should become more a holding company (like Berkshire Hathway or even Alphabet) and spin of some entities keeping a small interest."

     "Asking this question is kind of useless on Reddit. People on Reddit hate Meta and hate numbers. \n\n1. Which company made more money last quarter - Meta did (4.4B versus 2.9B)\n2. Which company has a better current ratio - Meta does (2.6 versus 0.9)\n3. Which company has better free cash flow\\* - Meta does (300M versus -5B)\n4. Which company has a better gross margin - Meta does (79% versus 45%)\n\nBoth companies spent a ton on capex in the quarter which I assume is money well spent. I assume Amazon dumps a ton into AWS but also dumps a ton into their logistics network (trucks, warehouses etc, all necessary to keep growing the retail side of the business). Meta dumped most of their capex into their AI supercomputer. \n\nI love both companies but don't let this echo chamber of hate towards Meta distract you from the numbers. Even though they lost 3.7B on reality labs in the quarter (their money furnace), they still made more than Amazon. Also, the users of their apps grew in the quarter, so the argument that the family of apps side of the business is dying is unfounded.\n\nPersonally, I would buy a share of each. One is valued at like $250B and the other at $1T. If you want more upside buy Meta, if you want more safety, buy Amazon. I am buying both right now."

For instance, if we're talking VR meetings vs. Microsoft Teams or Zoom or whatever, if I'm in a VR headset I can't do anything else but that meeting. I can't be working on something else in another window listening for my name, I can't look at my phone, I can't google something real quick to add to the meeting. Nope, I'm stuck in the headset. Same with watching movies. If I'm watching netflix, I want to be able to use a phone and a web browser at the same time. If I watch in VR, I get a huge screen and great sound, but at the cost of losing all contact with the outside world. To me, that's a net loss."

     "Hey there, fellow primate! This sounds like a pretty sticky situation, let's peel it back with Monkey Banana language.\r  \n\r  \nYour mother found a bunch of SQQQ bananas (bought shares in SQQQ), and those bananas have been rotting (losing value) over the past four months. It sounds like she may have been attracted to the shininess of these bananas without understanding that they don't stay fresh for long (the concept of decay in leveraged inverse ETFs).\r  \n\r  \nFirst, remember that each monkey has to choose their own bananas. Even though you introduced your mother to the jungle, she makes her own decisions about which bananas to pick up.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, it's always tough to see someone we care about keep holding onto rotten bananas. You might try sharing with her stories of other monkeys who've had similar experiences, or pointing her to resources that explain in simple terms why these particular bananas aren't good for long-term holding.\r  \n\r  \nPerhaps she would be open to talking with a wise old monkey (financial advisor) who can help her understand the risks and strategies involved in picking bananas in the jungle (investing in the stock market). Sometimes hearing it from a third party can make a big difference.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, don't forget to look after your own bananas. It's great that you want to help, but remember that every monkey has to learn their own lessons.\r  \n\r  \nNeed more tips on how to navigate the banana jungle?

I started when I was 18, in 2020, I am 21 now. During those first couple of years, market went wild. I missed seemingly every opportunity.\n\nBut one thing I realized. The opportunities kept coming, and will keep coming. First next gen tech, then EV, then crypto, then rotation out of tech, now back to tech, and AI. \n\nThere is no shortage of opportunities in this world. If you keep your eyes open for the next opportunity, instead of reflecting on the past and what you missed, you will find it. This is a mistake people often make. They chase after trains that have already departed not seeing the new one arrive at the station. \n\n\nArtificial Intelligence is just getting started. I always was bummed I wasn\u2019t alive or old enough during the early days of the internet, because that seemed like a generational wealth creation opportunity I missed. \n\nAnd then came ChatGPT. I now know a second wealth creation opportunity has arrived. \n\nI believe the best companies in the AI space have yet to even form! People forget Amazon IPO\u2019d late into the tech bubble, 1997 I believe. Maybe the next great AI company is still under construction. But keep your eyes out instead of reflecting on the past. \n\n\nOne final word about Nvidia- nothing intrisntic about the business changed, the arrival of ChatGPT changed the company\u2019s outlook. It was getting (unfairly) beat down in 2022 , no one saw ChatGPT coming unless you worked in the space. \n\n\nGood luck investing."

     "Tech will continue to outperform all other sectors.\n\nI've heard people call tech a bubble in the entirety of the past decade and more. (You have encountered them).\n\nThe people who always try to convince you that the fall of tech is just around the corner, that perhaps another - unknown stock - will lead the next decade. (You have encountered them).\n\nThese people are the same people who hate on people who buy Nvidia 4090 GPUs. They know what's the best of class product or stock, but don't want other people to enjoy the gains if they don't have it (crabs in a bucket).\n\nBeware these people, as they can sound convincing and once you accept their (tech bubble) ideas, you may also become one of these people after you miss out on gains.\n\nIt's better to **keep it simple.** Tech revenue is growing at high double digits, that means their outperformance is still intact as no other sector is growing so. Debating over whether the stock should be 25 or 35 PE is meaningless, because double digit growth changes PE ratios quickly.\n\nFor example, MSFT's EPS is 2.5x higher than it was just 4 years ago. It might be hard to appreciate 20% in one year, but it adds up. That means 35 PE becomes 14 PE in just 4 years.\n\nIf you buy tech at a local peak and it goes down, like it did in 2020 and 2022, you're supposed to average down. MSFT Azure was growing at 46% this time last year despite the falling share price. They are opportunities and not \"aha tech bubble\" moments."

     "They do really need to clean house in HR. I got an offer from them with a total compensation package near $700k a year. I, of course, had a lot of questions. I met with five different people in HR. I didn't really mind the number of trips since I live near their HQ in South Lake Union and work a couple of blocks from the one HR person I met with in Bellevue, WA. None of the five could answer even basic questions. They were all not only stupid, which is fine, not everyone is smart, but they were extremely lazy. They wouldn't even ask someone higher up for the answers, much less do their own research. After I think it was seven months total from scheduling the first interview to back and forth meetings with HR, I found out the average person on that job had been there less than nine months and new hires lasted less than five months on average. So, I'd be working with guys that mostly didn't have that much experience, and I wasn't even sure I'd have the job for five months. So, the hiring process would have probably taken longer than the job lasted. I joked about that with one of their HR directors, and he didn't think that was funny. He thought it was normal. To make it worse, the vesting was only 5% the first year, so if I left in less than a year, I would have made less than I make on my current job! No thanks.\n\nAside: I worked on an LMS (learning management system) for human resources about 15 years ago. Our goal was to provide training for certifications like SHRM. The vast majority of HR employees failed miserably, and they just weren't trainable."

When it reports full results for 2022 later this month, Amazon is expected to show its first-ever year of percentage revenue growth in the single digits, while operating margins have fallen by more than half from the previous year.\\n\\nWall Street hasnt been kind; Amazons share price fell 50% in 2022its worst year since the dot-com bubble burst and notably worse than its mega-tech peers, save for Facebook-parent Meta Platforms. Amazon has shed more than $1 trillion in market value since the stock peaked in July of 2021, during Mr. Jassys first week on the job. \\n\\nBut unlike the woes of Facebooks parent, Amazons troubles cant really be blamed on a massive strategic misstep by its current boss.

     "Analysts are funny. The retail expansion wasn't a mistake in timing. It was to take as much of the market as fast as possible, to better leverage scale down the line. As long as the losses aren't an existential threat, its perfectly fine to expand till things slow. Thats where they are now. Time to adjust and prepare for the next growth cycle.\n\nThe end goal for Amazon is extreme efficiency and when it comes to that as well as logistics and warehouse automation, Amazon is the world leader and no one is even close. This is precisely because they are tech savvy unlike most other retailers.\n\nSo the long term picture is that Amazon wants to be a vertical retailer. From manufacturing products, to shipping them, warehousing them, and selling them. In time this will result in a significant pricing advantage over competitors.\n\nOf course nothing goes perfectly smooth. You will get some lucky years and some unlucky but you still need to push forward or be left behind.\n\nAll that said, Amazon still has tons of room to grow in retail. Grocery is still a small piece of the pie and you can see that they are trying to push into it. But grocery is hard due to shelf life. And Amazon doesnt want more traditional retail stores so its sort of a pickle. Enter the check-out-less stores. Those just stared a few years ago. Obviously they have a long way to expand once they nail it down.\n\nThey are also making a huge push with in house products. The number of in house stuff has expanded greatly the last few years. Its really impressive actually and the products are not bad. Not like the early days of generic brands."

  "Text": "b'Amazon.com Inc. is the worlds first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year. \\n\\nShares in the e-commerce and cloud company fell 4.3% on Wednesday, pushing its market value to about $879 billion from a record close at $1.88 trillion on July 2021. Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. \\n\\nWhile technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. \\nThe e-commerce giant has shed $1 trillion in market value\\n  \\nThe worlds largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting'",

Stock price up 5%.\n- CLFD: Big rise on great guidance and information about government spending tailwinds.

     "It's just dumb to short NVDA because at best it's a great company that's overvalued. TSLA was literally going bankrupt a few years back, so it's not really a fair comparison.\n\nAnd while I'd argue it's massively overvalued relative to other tech valuations, it's probably not that overvalued if you believe they can achieve 50% growth rates for several years while maintaining 30-40% net profit margins. In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.\n\nI think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.\n\nPersonally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price. With lots of companies now beginning to build their own AI-optimised chips I worry whether NVDA can defend their margins. If they execute well I think they probably can, but when you have a stretched valuation that's not really good enough."

After seeing success stories like Mercado Libre and Sea Limited I couldnt help but buy a few shares of Jumia around $20. The problem is that you sort of have to believe in the African growth story for the thesis to work out long term. \\n\\nIt seems like Africa lacks the infrastructure to handle logistics, like there are not even street addresses in some areas of Africa. Many countries have weaker financial institutions including a large unbanked population without checking accounts. And the internet penetration rates can be really low in some countries. \\n\\nI feel like at certain inflection point of development in emerging markets there will most likely not be a country or region that will be an exception to increasing e-commerce adoption. But even though Jumia as a first mover advantage, Im not sure if theyll be the company to revolutionize e-commerce in Africa if wide e-comme'",

     "Longtime Jumia bag holder here.  My opinion:\n\nOverall, they had poor growth the first couple years after IPO.  They were changing their model from direct sales of big ticket items to third party sales and high volume consumer staples.  \n\nSo as the volume of sales went up, they lost the highest profit margin business so that hurt their sales growth.  But even with that they underdelivered.\n\nBut this is a good decision long term and the last earnings report was actually really good (imo).  Large increase in revenue, net loss stayed about same, so improving margin.  They are basically breaking even minus advertising - which isn\u2019t great but def improving.  Their net loss stayed steady despite something like 45 percent more sales.  So they aren\u2019t just losing more to get more sales.\n\nSo high revenue growth, improving margins, some of the advertising should be coming off books to be matched with new sales mean they may break even in next year or so.  But if I\u2019m being honest, I think their path is to grow sales at the fastest clip they can without losing money so i don\u2019t expect any earnings any time soon - but if they can keep growth over 25 percent while breaking even I think that\u2019s a win\u2026 or even lose money for 45 percent growth is fine in a bull market not now.\n\nSo Financing will be hurt by market rates and exchange, but by my estimates they can survive a couple years even at status quo.  \n\nI also think the share price is crushed because the best companies to buy them were Chinese, and China has been crushed.\n\nAmazon is coming NOW, and that is scaring everyone but I think that\u2019s actually good.  Amazon will bring a lot of infrastructure and demand for online which should raise all the ships.  There is room for several online companies.  I also think if Amazon has any brains they\u2019ll just buy 25 percent of one of these dirt cheap front runners and build their network out from there instead of starting from scratch.  That should boost all of their values.\n\nIt\u2019s Africa - you knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy.  But I still think what they got is worth way more than 4 per share and I bet they\u2019ll hit 20 in a year or two when everything recovers\u2026. But it\u2019s gonna be a white knuckle sorta investment, maybe 25 percent it goes to 20, 50 percent it limps around forever and and 25 percent it craps out.  It\u2019s not a BAD expected return, but just super risky and you can find some better bets out there if you look hard enough, but this isn\u2019t totally terrible for high risk profiles.\n\nBeyond that it comes down to can africa become a world economic engine.  Honestly the news of the last year strongly points to no.  Nationalization of mines, labor strikes, currency collapse, corruption all seem to be so imbedded it can\u2019t be solved in the next decade, and this Russian war is gonna make food scarce\u2026. But africa is resilient, so perhaps it can rise!  But a lot of jumia\u2019s potential value is in Africa\u2019s ability to have massive exponential growth which it has been really unable to deliver much in terms of positive signs.  But things change!  I wouldn\u2019t bet against africa to grow a ton in our lifetime, but you might not want to put all your eggs in Africa, in fact maybe just put one or two you can afford to lose cuz it\u2019s kinda obviously a bad idea on face.\n\nI also think the payout here is extreme.  If Jumia is the front runner, and africa becomes an economic engine either on its own or because of  some US/Chinese/India fallout\u2026 you might have that generational stock.  \n\nAs others have said, you might be better off with AFK or something if you aren\u2019t going to follow it close."

     "Mostly a scam. It really exists but it is not used much and is not very profitable. It just doesn't really fill a practical niche, except perhaps for a small number of affluent urban people.\n\nThe issue is actually not internet penetration. Africa has actually been a leader in internet banking because mobile phone usage exploded and it solved huge issues in areas where you could get mobile coverage but where transportation was poor. Like, for instance, let's say you work in Lagos but your family still lives in a rural area with poor roads. Twenty years ago maybe the only way to support them was to come home a couple times a year and leave a chunk of money, or else send it with friends and hope it gets there. Now you can just do it with your phone. Even in a rural area if you had banking needs maybe it would take a day and you would spend 1/10th of your money in transport to get there. \n\nSo, if you want to invest in something in this general area I'd recommend mobile phone providers, for instance Africa Airtel."

     "In my limited experience as a customer they seem to have figured some things out, I'm in a somewhat rural place but JMIA delivers to a store in a medium sized city near me and the store works as a pick-up place that they pay per the transaction, so JMIA isn't delivering themselves nor paying staff to stand there waiting for you. \n\nIn the last earnings report it sounded like they got the founders out and they were bringing in some people to really concentrate on making it profitable instead of being fixated on growth. Including ending some offerings that were leading to losses. But I'd give it a few quarters and want the turnaround to materialize before I consider buying. I see the food delivery drivers everywhere in Kampala but that might still be a money loser overall, stuff like that could definitely be on the chopping block. I think their free delivery membership or something was already getting cut and they were pulling out of some smaller markets. \n\nIt could definitely be an acquisition target for someone like AMZN or even BABA. The market cap is less than half a billion, so you could justify buying it in large part for the existing familiarity. I think it was Jamie Dimon who said during the initial covid crash that spending on market share in an economic downturn is a lot more effective than spending when the economy is hot."

In villages there are places where packages are delivered which will be further distributed in the village or picked up. Yes transportation is less efficient in rural areas but also there is more and cheaper labor to compensate for that.\n\nThe picture you painted that in Africa its mainly starving poor people who need to be developed by the global north is racist and not a fact. Have you been to any major city there? They also have airports and infrastructure and comparably rich persons. Yes, it will not be a one to one copy of amazon with huge fullfillment centers in every region, but neither will it be like this in other major regions like in the ASEAN countries. \n\nEven in the global north, many products are coming directly from China and will just be delivered by airplane and then with the carrier. You can also have a large product storage facility and processing center near the major airports and products can be sent in many countries and regions.\n\nBy the way, even if large package carriers don't send to certain rural areas, private persons and small companies do that, for example through buses and bus companies. Stuff ordered online in a big city and the transported by another company to the rural areas. Win and no risk for the e-commerce company...."

Before Peloton it was parallel rollers (yikes) or slightly raised rear fans. The former you had to be very conscious of your training line. The latter you needed to put extra wear on the rear tire, clip the front brake and raise the front axle to comp for the rear. Both solutions had risks, but the rollers did seem most natural for the bike to behave.\n\nHindsight 20/20 here I admit. But any stationary bike is going to have huge training forces put on the frame and rider supporting elements. If I rode Peleton like any bike daily before ride inspect the gear. Weekly, I'd take a penlight and go over all the welds and seams. I wish the company well and hope they recover. \n\nBests all, speedy recovery to those injuired. I myself had a bad wrist fracture from a different source, no fun."

     "Home exercise equipment that many purchased during the pandemic has gone through all sorts of horror.\n\nPeloton and NordicTrack/ iFIT are the two main companies that sell home bikes/treadmill equipment to home users. They sued each other in 2021/2022 and settled by separating feature sets (for example, peloton has leaderboards and live classes, while NordicTrack does not anymore).\n\nNow if you bought a Peloton bike between 2020-2022 as many people did during the pandemic, you have to deal with the fact that your bike seat will likely fail and you\u2019ll find yourself with a metal pole up your bum mid-workout. If you bought a Peloton treadmill, your small child or pet may have been swept underneath and crushed.\n\nIf you purchased a bike or treadmill from the Peloton competitor NordicTrack as of October 2022, your equipment may not have physically assaulted you, but it will have auto-updated and removed the bootloader from the OS sometime between October 2022-now (it still auto-updates to this today as we experienced). Hard resetting the machine results in the same issue, because as soon as you update, you can no longer boot the device and you\u2019ll see a \u201cSupported API: 3\u201d error code.\n\nThe resolution for the issue has prompted a separate lawsuit. Many folks have been asked to spend $600-800 on a replacement console if they are out of warranty (illegal). The lead time for this part is 4+ months because it impacted ALL devices purchased within the 2020-early 2022 timeframe.\n\nI now have a very expensive 300lb paperweight. The best part is that at this rate, both companies will go under for selling their faulty equipment which cost users thousands."

Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZNs IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself wouldve been an impressive feat but it wouldnt be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time.

     "Two things.\n\nFirst. You expect me to read all of this? Seriously? It's all over the place and includes a lot of fluff. In addition, Amazon's financials are very consolidated and don't provide much value at a deep level. Unless you have access to management and spend a lot of time following them and building up financial models over years, there really isn't much that can be done at a detailed level. And I personally wouldn't spend the time to build up detailed financials myself on a company like this because you could probably get 80% of what you need to know about valuation with some very high level assumptions and cursory look at their financial metrics over time. (This isn't the case for all companies however.)\n\nSecond. $115 vs $85 is a terrible margin of safety on a company like Amazon. Especially in a rising rate environment and the significant risks that you are missing. I would personally want something above 2x to consider betting on the company in this environment. \n\nAs you get older you'll realize that Amazon isn't really cheap right now and there are probably a lot better plays. Probably someplace in MicroCaps where you can get an advantage and actually understand the components of the business at a more detailed level. It would require a good amount of research, but the exercise would probably be more valuable and illuminating than trying to roll the dice on consolidated financials on a company as large as this one with so many moving pieces and conflicting priorities.\n\nIn addition, while you write a lot of stuff on here, you don't really understand their strategy or the major issues facing the company. While it is nice to analyze the financials, I think you need to spend more time learning about the business and other business disciplines. Because a lot of the \"analysis\" is cutting and pasting quotes from management. Many of which aren't really that critical and don't tell you much about the organization.\n\nGood luck on your journey."

I think they invested about $2.5b and its currently worth well north of $3.5b. Not exactly a big deal to Amazon regardless but you need to consider that its not easy for big companies to take big stakes like this in public companies. This was a success.

If that\u2019s the case, your parents would have seen their investment fall from $6000 to roughly $1200 after September 11th. If your dad\u2019s assessment \u201cwe lost it all\u201d is correct, it\u2019s possible they sold at or near the bottom for fear of it going to zero. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that they held on because that $6000 would have turned into more than ~$24,000 by 2013, and would have been a somewhat significant marital asset when they divorced. Hard to imagine missing that. It\u2019s possible the stock was sold at that time and the money divided based on how they agreed to split their assets."

As a fellow trader, Amazon is probably not a bad buy here, but you should be eyeing Google if you're looking to trade off big tech because Google is likely very oversold here. I would buy Google here and once it corrects, I would take some profits off and perhaps look at Amazon then.\n\nEven if you think Google isn't oversold from this past week and you expect it to drop further, you should hold your cash and wait for when you do think it's oversold. It's a great opportunity for a nice trade here. I only mention Google because it's big tech like Amazon.\n\nDisclosure, I have a huge stake in both Amazon and Google as of right now.

If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS & not their retail side. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nUber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence & its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable & likely never will be.\\n\\nTSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking & getting closer to all other car manufacturers.\\n\\nNVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications.

Imagine that was a fruitless money sink, Tesla has more chance of creating that service, given that is a pipe-dream now, any justification for tech sector prices left with it)\n\nFood delivery services on the other hand have inserted themselves into a system and take significant margin from take-out services, under pay their staff and triple charge customers (increased menu prices vs. phoning an order in, platform service charge and increasing tip need to even get it delivered).  Beyond a joke they can\u2019t make money despite screwing every party of the transaction over.\n\nWhat room do they have to grow to make profitability? The service is already falling apart.\n\nCouldn\u2019t even make money during the pandemic\u2026 smh. \n\nThat\u2019s a sector crying out for AI, just put delivery costs out to bid based on live demand vs supply (let the drivers pick the pay rate they\u2019ll take) run a delivery support service only, \nintegrate with existing delivery services (Uber etc) \n\n/rant over, fuck doordash"

The reason why wasn't some fundamental breakthrough in computer science, it was because we finally had enough compute to make these large scale networks learn and interpolate without it taking forever. Deep learning impacted the economy because HARDWARE got better. We've had the \"recipe\" for deep learning since like the 50s.\n\nSimilarly, LLMs aren't really all that different from deep learning and the idea has been \"around\" for a while. The most impactful breakthrough was the discovery of something called \"attention\" and \"transformers\" but this is really just an interation in the something called a recurrent neural network, which again is something that's been around since the 1970s. So again, the reason for this compute is HARDWARE related.\n\nIf data is the new oil, then GPUs (or better yet TPUs or other ML focused architectures) are the pump jack."

     "- Marvel hasn't been the same after Endgame. Comic book shows/movies fatigue is real.\n\n- It's evident Disney is clearly running out of new ideas with all these live-action adaptation that the majority of their subs don't really ask for. \n\n- Star Wars only caters to its ardent fanbase which I imagine is smaller Marvel's and Disney's. I gather the die hard fans from the 80s arent that enthusiastic about the spin-offs. \n\n- Honest question. What about Anime? Maybe they can add this to their lineup? Anime is still growing in the West and is watched by many adults as well. Netflix got it right adding a lot of Anime in their already gigantic catalog."

     "The D+ customer base was always questionable because of all the free and discounted accounts. I want to see where they land once its no longer such. Im honestly am not a fan of D+ content either. Tbh, I havent enjoyed a Marvel movie since the original Spiderman and XMen movies. I also liked the old Punisher show and to a lesser extend, Luke Cage and Daredevil. The X-Men needed a TV show (rather than all the copy cat teams). But point is content is a bit sparse for adults though I will admit they are doing a decent job with SW shows... though the movies were major suck.\n\nThe other issue I have with them is I dont like Iger and never did in the old days either. To me he is responsible for that terrible fox deal and the low margins now.\n\nNot worried about Disney overall. Their margins are still under pressure due to inflation and spending but its just a matter of time to figure them out. Once they have adjusted I expect to see $13b net in short order, maybe in 2025. Basically back to 2018/19 level plus another $1b. That would put us at about 13 PE and I think those numbers are rather conservative at that. The upside potential is much higher.\n\nDebt is a concern but again... thats was due to the bad Iger deal before he bolted. Its being paid down rather quickly so thats good. Hopefully Iger doesnt screw the pooch on managing that.\n\nIll keep my shares. Small position in my case but I like their long term outlook."

That additional cash should flow nicely in the second half of year earnings.\n\nStill going to hold as the thesis has not changed."

After recent releases from the US Census Bureau, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Institute for Supply Management, the nowcasts of second-quarter real personal consumption expenditures growth and second-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth increased from 1.3 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, to 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, while the nowcast of the contribution of the change in real net exports to second-quarter real GDP growth decreased from 0.38 percentage points to 0.31 percentage points.\n\nIt's true jobs got revised down in the earlier parts of the quarter. I'm not sure how much that matters for forward-looking stocks. Market is not going to care if Q1 gets revised down to 0.5% growth or something, and Q2 comes in strong. In any case, even if jobs growth slowed down in February/March, the unemployment rate *decreased* and wages came in hot, so it didn't appear to have much of an impact.\n\n----\n\nIrrelevant portfolio comments: Nice strong day. Coal names benefited from the rising market, with AMR rising nearly 6% and wiping out my losses. Very excited for Monday's earnings. If I had to pick the stock I was most bullish on in my entire portfolio right now (at current prices), it would be AMR.\n\nBTU + 3.6%, FCX (copper) +3.6%.

I feel like this completely debunks the whole credit crunch by regional and small banks thesis.\n\nEven if deposits went down I wouldn't actually be worried as long as credit was flowing heartily like it is.  We expect that deposits might shrink and that just means bank profits shrink a bit due to more expensive funding costs like brokered CDs.  But even then, excluding foreign institutions deposits, US actually went up \ud83d\ude02!\n\nI actually have had many long back and forth arguments with CRE doomers about office loans.  While class D properties have really taken a hit in values, many banks actually have pretty conservative LTVs and can absorb losses.  Moreover, it doesn't matter as long as banks are willing to renew loans or borrowers can refi elsewhere...  \"It isn't a loss until you sell\" actually applies to debt too.  It isn't a default as long as coverage ratios look healthy and the debt can be serviced (even with reduced occupancy), with loans extended or renewed.  Vacancies are slowly improving and eventually they will catch up."

Miners are going to drop like flies with lower rewards, and transaction fees MUST increase to account for the hash demand. Coinbase already has the highest fees of any exchange that their customers don't necessarily appreciate. They're going to need to cut some pretty big deals with their corporate partnerships if they want to keep business. As for retail traders, I don't know what they can do.

I won't go into all the details, but basically its a court case which has the potential to send an earthquake through the cryptosphere. If Ripple wins there will a big upshoot on the value of all crypto and the opposite if they lose - summary judgement should happen over the coming weeks/next couple of months. \n\nFinally, Bitcoin has doubled in value since the last earnings and COIN have made staffing cuts I could be wrong, but I think they'll post a nice PES in the next Q."

Disney said last month it plans to cut $5.5 billion in costs, including $3 billion in content spend.\\n\\nThis week, we begin notifying employees whose positions are impacted by the companys workforce reductions, Iger wrote in the memo, which was obtained by CNBC. Leaders will be communicating the news directly to the first group of impacted employees over the next four days. A second, larger round of notifications will happen in April with several thousand more staff reductions, and we expect to commence the final round of notifications before the beginning of the summer to reach our 7,000-job target.\\n\\nThe layoffs were initially announced i'",

But I still don't know what to do with them.\n\nAs someone who runs a small mostly online e-comm business, I think it's a great platform, probably the best option for most small and medium size businesses. But I still don't know how valuable a company it is.\n\nAs I see it there's 3 categories of e-comm companies\n\n1. Small startups or mom n pop stores that want an online presence\n2. Established or Mid-size e-comm companies\n3. Large e-comm companies and established brands or B&M stores\n\nI think that group 1 seems to be Shopify's biggest target market, but I see that as being doomed to fail, as 90% of those companies won't be able to make money online when they realise that the biggest challenge and cost online isn't the platform/ website design, it's marketing and getting people on to your site.\n\nGroup 2 - this is where Shopify may succeed long term - BUT those companies will be looking for better pricing as they grow. Shopify isn't cheap on payment processing fees for example, even on their expensive tiers. As other platforms improve (e.g. BigCommerce), I suspect Shopify will become engaged in a race to the bottom\n\nGroup 3 - These companies care less about Shopify's ease of set up etc.. and they probably don't like being tied in with a company with less flexibility, who will have all their own policies etc.. They have more options available to them (Magento, Drupal, Bigcommerce). Larger companies will be more heavily focused on price, flexibility etc.. which aren't Shopify's biggest strong points.\n\nShopify has been doing a big marketing push bragging about how easy it is to set up a store with them. However, most of those startup store owners will discover how little benefit that really is in the highly competitive online world, where it's all about visibility and marketing. **Having a nice looking website is no longer the hard part.** I suspect long term, more and more traffice (and revenue) will go through the big stores and marketplaces. As soon as a small startup succeeeds - they'll start looking to migrate from Shopify to save money and have more flexibility"

I put a little fun money in a startup that focused on clean energy fuel sources. I only gave it about $100 but thankfully that was all I lost. Bought in on what turned out to be a high of like $6 a share, when predictions were saying it would likely triple that in a year. Covid stalled out the company's projects, it dropped to penny stocks barely hitting 10 cents a share by the end of it. They ended up doing some crazy reverse split to try and get themselves back over a dollar in share price and I got cashed out for everything I had for like $2.

     "Worst: dumped about 9k into BSV at the very height of the crypto boom 2021. Had no knowledge of investing, trading, crypto, BTC, nothing - thought if you buy something that has increased a lot in price historically, just hold it until it's increased more before you sell, you're golden. I was deeply wrong and learned the hard way. I was also really into the idea of saving on taxes by holding for at least a year before selling anything. This led to my first mistake of not getting out of that horrible investment the 1 single time BSV experienced a peak high enough for me to have broken even.  Second mistake, became discouraged by BSV's pretty contstant trajectory downward from there (plus learning more and more about the total scam and lie that was BSV) and missed plenty of opportunities to average down and get out. After a couple of years, RH (my broker for that trade) delisted BSV and due to restrictions in my state, I had no option to transfer coins out off the platform so was forced to sell at a massive loss of about 90%. \nLearnings: a ton, but top learnings - DO THE RESEARCH. DD is non-negotioable. Read the charts for entries, don't just jump in. Understand the context before taking risk. Understand the risk itself - examine every possible scenario regarding the fundamentals of the asset & the contract you are entering with the trade. Understand the very real risks of delisting and what your backup plan will be. Understand the full scope of entry/exit plans before you put your capital on the line. Learned a lot from this deeply expensive lesson, and it hurt bad. Still does.\n\nBest: Have been keeping my sizable savings in t-bills and t-bill ETFs to take advantage of current high rates on short termers. Doesn't yield a whole lot but it's like a tax-advantaged savings account for me until I feel ready to jump into riskier assets. Feel great about this decision as it was extremely well-informed and I understand exactly what I'm doing with it. From worst to best, I see myself on a great trajectory towards future success."

     "This kind of comment is usually down voted, but still worth saying IMO.\n\nWhat you did is called gambling. You bet that if you bought stock about a company you know little about, it would increase in price. It didn't.\n\nInvesting, on the other hand, is usually long term. And even then, it's not guaranteed to be safe. You find a company with good fundamentals and potential and put your money in it. \n\nNow, is Apple that company? It really depends on what YOU want. Apple's the biggest strength (and weakness) is that it's almost a cult. Just like Coke VS Pepsi, people decide that Apple is better and are willing to spend much more than they would otherwise for a comparable product.\n\nAnd there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. All brands based on luxury and upscaling do it. Starbucks, Tesla, Dom Perignon, Armani, Rolex, Bose.. they are all good, some really good, but not as good as the price reflects. There are comparable products for a fraction of the price.\n\nSo that strategy is great. While people have extra money to spend. In times when the economy isn't doing so well, people are concerned about rent, gas and groceries and not about the phone that will make you look wealthy. \n\nSo Apple doesn't have the brightest near future but it still is a very solid company. A  recession is looming and inflation is starting to take a toll. Any company that offers over-inflated products won't do well for a while.\n\nSo if you want to consider it an investment that in the short-term isn't doing well, it's your choice. But you're going to have to hand in there until the market changes. Think years. And embrace the risk. It might never go back to where it was (personally I think it will, in a few years).\n\nOn the other hand,  you can just call it a bad gamble, sell the position and go home, just like you would at a casino. No shame in that."

Their CEO has constantly harped on this idea that the company was working to automate the home and rid us of the burdens of house chores, yet, after 30 years of existence, they only offer products for one.\n\nFor years they teased their lawnmower, just to cancel its launch at the last moment. I should have sold then, but held hoping that once they got to the other side of supply chain issues they'd use their cash and years of R&D investment to finally launch a new product. I guess not. Looks like this grand idea of home automation was lip service to investors looking for a growth stock. The sale to amazon pretty much confirms this."

They are literally unicorns and they come around very rarely...also most people wouldn't recognize them early on. It only becomes evident in hindsight after the stock blows up and then you kick yourself for not buying earlier."

     "I mean it's possible you will have a company rise from the grave like Apple. You have to remember what a big piece of shit that was until the first iPod and iPhone. Steve reinvigorated that company. I mean it was dead weight even through the 90s and into the early 2000s. So the first option is a company that rebuilds itself into something like that. Like if intel just magically got their act together or who knows? So that's option one the second one is some disruptive business. People are looking at EV charging stations as a potential boom cycle but I kind of wonder how much growth and valuation you can really put in a gas station? I don't think we really have any clear leadership yet because we don't even know what the leadership sector is going to be for the next bull market. Right now it's commodities, but commodity cycles never last that long. I think 2005 to 2008 was probably one of the longer ones"

Maybe they get over their hurdles of being an expensive geek toy, and take over the world, like computers did.  Trouble is computers started out being useful, and then became a toy.  What started as a toy and became useful?  Phones maybe?\n\nTrouble with investing in this space is Meta is just a hard nope.    Their hugeness and their history, mean it won't be them, they had their time in the son, and made a mess of it.\n\nMSFT is kind of a secret player here.  Could be what they were thinking when buying Activision.  They have branded goggles.  They have Teams.   They have a gaming ecosystem.  They are well positioned, but, they are big name, last wave's news.     Same with AAPL, like they made pocket computers cool, and desperately need something new to continue to justify their price.  If anyone can bring this stuff to the masses, it's them.  This next thing though is already priced in, everyone has AAPL because they think AAPL is going to do something cool again, like with the Mac and then the iPhone.\n\n\nWhat you'd want though, which I don't see or know about, is the scrappy little company that hasn't made it yet that becomes the dominant player in this space, like TSLA or Spotify did.     That might be the next thing to watch for.  On the other hand, has that company already been bought by a big player?   Has the world changed so we don't get a new whatever, it's at best the brand of a big player?\n\nAs for something else, I wish I knew.

While these are small applications that won\u2019t convince most investors, NVIDIA has pivoted in recent years to completely embrace artificial intelligence and deep learning and are moving the company in that direction.

     "Like you said in your edit, it's most likely not already a big 500b+ company like the ones in your title.\n\nMy call is it will be NIO. [Here](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-chinas-electric-drive-swappable-car-batteries-2022-03-24/) is an article that reflects my thinking. The whole EV industry acts as if fast charging is going to \"improve\" and that battery swapping is irrelevant. Those who make those claims completely miss the point and ignore reality. Charging speed could improve, but it could also get worse. \"How is that possible?\" you and every moron Telsa Boi might ask. Well, it's simple. There are already batteries in existence that can allow a Tesla to go over 750 miles on a single charge. Why hasn't Tesla implemented these? Longer charge times and faster degradation. The \"longest range\" batteries require materials that only last for a few recharge cycles so putting them in a Tesla would mean the car would only last a couple years before the battery was completely wiped out. NIO will never have that problem. They will always be able to use the latest and greatest battery technology - even if that means single-use batteries (which do exist btw) that have some crazy 2500 mile range. Tesla does not have that flexibility. Tesla has to worry about how many recharge cycles the battery can withstand without significant degradation and so they are forced to forgo certain battery configurations that would allow them to achieve 750 mile range. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM are not researching battery swap tech because they believe that is not what the market wants, because the market leader (Tesla) says so. Everyone is just following Papa Elon's lead like he's Einstein. Newsflash: Even Einstein was wrong sometimes. The fact that the whole industry is blindly playing follow the leader should tell you something.\n\nAlso, Tesla's P/S is about 30x, while NIO's P/S is less than 10x even though Tesla is a megacap company and NIO is only $25B (normally, growth stage companies have much higher P/S because their sales are expect to \"grow\" while larger companies have lower P/S because their sales are approaching maturity)..\n\nIn the next 5 years, NIO is going to flood the US market with premium quality low cost EVs and everyone's going to say \"I missed NIO but at least I didn't invest in Tesla\""

GME stock is believed to be over shorted but even without the potential for a short squeeze I see this stock 10x in the coming years throughout its transformation.. all just my opinion, do your own research"

Recently I thought of dividing the last 20% differently and giving 10-15% to 1 company that I believe in instead of dividing it between them \"randomly\" as I did until now, and I thought of Google for the following reasons:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\* AI - I use AI technologies and ChatGPT daily.

     "You should recognise that although Google represents itself as a technology company, by revenue, it's an advertising company. About 80% of its revenue. I can't find what percentage of that is from paid search, but I imagine it's quite large.\n\nThe search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.\n\nNow go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.\n\nGoogle can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.\n\nSo I think google is going to face serious headwinds in terms of their core revenue drivers. They will survive, but its going to be painful. They got complacent. The tortoise overtook the hare while he was resting on his laurels."

This was responsible for about 80% of Amazon's net income for their 4th Q but their operating profits fell by half. Their advertising and cloud business is booming but advertising is likely not yet profitable. Their retail business hasn't looked good lately with higher costs surging and unlikely to stop any time soon.\n\nWith Rivian prices dropping from their recorded $103 price at Dec 31 to now $45, they are sitting at an $8.2 billion net loss that will have to be reported on their 1Q 2022 earnings. I'm curious to see how it will play out but the stock buyback is a scheduled buyback. The last time there was a stock purchase authorization was in 2016 for $5 billion. They only managed to purchase $2 billion worth of shares in that five year span with those buybacks actually only happening at the start of this year. This new $10 billion share buyback means they will only buy back about $8 billion but seeing as how they rarely even actually buyback their shares, it's possible they expect the stock price to go through some headwinds and want the opportunity to buyback. Seems like it was a great way for a temp stock boost for people to cash out but I would be wary going forward."

     "Frankly I'm truly surprised by the comments here and how people completely miss the mark on Peloton. This Amazon deal is huge, it will increase shipping time, save on shipping costs and more importantly, utilize Amazons 3rd party network of home installers to set up bikes. Peloton's greatest cost driver was their \"white glove\" service. As far as the product being a fad? Everyone that uses the service, rants and raves about it, it generates over 1.5 billion dollars in revenue just from their subscriptions with a 90% retention rate. It's successful because it plays into a human condition, we often chose the path of least resistance. If waking up, joining an ONLINE class before work from the comfort of your own home gets you to work out. Then 44 dollars a month cost is cheap price to pay for your health. How much do you spend on going out to eat every month? My wife lost 12 lbs during the pandemic using her Peloton. I agree that the business model needs to be revamped, but to trash on the product without actually using it, that just being silly. Recently soul cycle launched a marketing campaign against Peloton and basically got laughed out of the room, then it turned into a viral meme. Something about turning in a Peloton for a years worth of Soul Cycle classes. The public said, thanks but no thanks, it totally backfired. They have a cult following."

Youve seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when theres a threat of serious harm to the economy or to the financial system, and were prepared to use those tools, Powell said Wednesday during a news conference that followed the Feds decision to hike benchmark interest rates another quarter percentage point. And I think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe. Powell noted that deposit flows have stabilized over the past week following what he called powerful actions from the Fed to backstop the system.'",

     "AI will kill Fiverr\n\nBut presumably won't kill shopify.\n\nMy only issue with Shopify is that I don't know where there target market is really.  As I see it, as someone whose worked in ecommerce for 10 years,  Shopify have 3 types of customer\n\n1. Startup types dropshipping from their bedrooms. Shopify did very well out of this type of customer during the pandemic. My concern with this type is that 90% will fail and then cancel their shopify. The ones that are very successful may want to migrate to a different platform, as even Shopifys top tier plan isn't as cheap as some alternatives. \n\n2. Small mom n pop companies who want an online presence. I believe many of these will discover that selling online is extremely expensive when you try marketing. So they'll either sell very little or will give up online entirely \n\n3. Medium size or established small businesses. Many of these won't want to migrate to another platform to save $, but some will.  Shopifys continued success depends on these type of companies not wanting to switch\n\nSo, in summary,  my worry about shopify targeting small companies is that most of those companies will fail as they discover that the biggest impediment to selling online isn't having a nice looking store, but nstead huge marketing costs. \nOf the ones that are successful - how many will stay? The difficulty and cost in changing platform is perhaps Shopifys Moat"

     "Anecdotal, but lately I have been trying to stock up/prep on items I know I will need for the next 12 months and wont go bad in that time if I store them.  One of the first things I ordered from Walmart. com this way was 12 bars of Sure Unscented Deodorant (very hard to find).  Within about 2 hours a random unmarked, older sketchy car pulls up to my house.  Old dude gets out and opens his trunk...my office is at the front of my house so I see everyone.  He opens the trunk and pulls out a single Walmart bag and it dawns on me its my delivery already.  Holy shit, that's impressive right?  So I go get the bag and realize....there is ONE FUCKING DEODORANT IN THERE!   I was like \"wtf is going on?\".   2 hours later another dude shows up and drops off 2 more....  FINALLY, the next day FedEX dropped off the final 9 from the Warehouse itself.  Finally realized the local store fulfills what they can and then the Warehouse does the rest.  I paid 1.97 per deodorant.  So literally the first and second guy most likely spent more in gas than the deodorant cost me.  Walmart needs to get a handle on how to do this if they are going to take the mantle from Amazon.  In the meantime, I will pay whoever offers me the cheapest rates."

I just sat with all the other waiting customers staring as just a few employees slowly went back and forth from the store to the next waiting car.\n\nWal-Mart simply doesn't have the employee staffing level/skills to pull something like this off.  I watched an order-picker once grab a loaf of bread off the shelf and tuck it (squeeze it) under her arm so she could grab the next item.    The staff aren't paid enough to care.

I told the guy on the phone that my 30 days was about to expire so would I still be able to return the item after 30 days if I still hadnt gotten my shipping label? He assured me it was ok.

     "**General macro comments**:\n\nAtlanta GDPNow still at 3.2% for Q1 2023 real quarterly annualized growth, unchanged from yesterday. Next update is Friday, March 24th.\n\nAlso, apparently the housing starts was way bigger than expected. I'll just add that it seems that particular statistic is extremely noisy. \n\n> Privately-owned housing starts in February 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,450,000. This is 9.8 percent (+/- 15.5%)* above the revised January 2023 estimate of 1,321,000\n\nThat is a 90% confidence interval of [-5.7, 25.3], or statistically indistinguishable from 0.\n\nIf you look at the other indicators reported by the [Census Bureau Index of Economic Activity](https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/), housing start estimates have much larger confidence intervals / high uncertainty compared to the other ones.\n\n---\n\n**Useless comments on my portfolio + BTU Update**:\n\nWhat a great day for my big tech holdings. AMD up 7.7%, GOOG up 4.7%, MSFT up 4%, SMH up 4%, META up 3.6%. I will soon be using these opportunities to trim (slightly) MSFT/AAPL/AMD as they are too big of an individual position. I'll move the cash into my small cap value ETFs, or from AMD to SMH.\n\nMeanwhile, on the commodity side, yesterday I had went pretty hard on BTU/AMR/XOM/PSCE. Today I added to CF (fertilizer). Some exciting news on BTU is that Investor Relations told some folks that they are working hard to get the surety bond covenants taken care of before March 31st, and at the worst, a little bit into April. A blackout period will start pretty soon (between quarter end and the next earnings report), so they might not get time to start capital returns. But at least an announcement about it will soon occur. Follow @8750Capital and @tradedollarnut on Twitter for more news (you won't find it anywhere else).\n\nAMR remains highly undervalued if you want an entry point. It tends to zoom up to $170 then come right back down. Eventually, the math of high met coal prices and buying out 30% of your float will win."

     "Could someone please explain the second paragraph about delta hedging in simple terms:\n\n> Some might wonder why a banking crisis is hitting oil so hard, as it is unlikely to impact crude demand and production. But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.\n\n> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.\n\nSo financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.\n\nThe firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works? (What would be the price of the sale? Would it be higher or lower than the current market price? Who gets the right to buy/sell?)"

For every $1 of revenue, $PLUG spend >$1 while Amazon basically gets free stuff from those $PLUG deals.\n\nThe only way that $PLUG stay afloat is either issuing more shares or raising capital from bonds which is pretty expensive now. Both mean $PLUG shareholders will be fucked."

Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have all slashed their ranks.

It appears half the team (20 odd people) have early meetings scheduled at intervals and the other half the same meeting time late morning. All virtual since they are full remote. Early meetings are getting canned meetings so far. Effective immediately, yes to severance, and equipment to be returned by mail. Team lead didn't know until an hour before meetings started. My friend is in the later group meeting time which he presumes are the leftovers being kept on.\n\nCan't say I'm surprised as from what I've heard he does maybe a few hours of actual work and the rest of the day just passing time logged in."

The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  \\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to \"",

I remember being a manager at Walmart around 6 years ago when they made huge efforts in increasing pay and employee on job training to lower turnover and it worked and they wound up saving money on labor despite having higher wages. \n\nExecutives at this big companies can be very short sighted and stupid. Unions aren't that big of a deal, last I checked UPS is more profitable than FedEx but UPS has a union and FedEx doesn't. \n\nTreating your workforce with respect and paying a decent wage goes a long way towards morale and employee engagement. If you treat them like shit they'll give you much less effort and that will effect the company's bottom line."

I know that many of you probably FOMO'd in the last year on some risky bets that are now tanking. My guess is that this rotation will continue out of tech and growth for the next few months so expect more pain. The bright side is, consumer demand remains strong and inflation should subside.

At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. Tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles. The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.\\n\\nWitnesses '",

     "**Mastercard has the same fees in the UK as Visa does**, raised even before Visa did it. So, either Amazon wants to set an example or there is a strategic move (compensating for rising inflation/supply chain costs) in play there. Have the feeling this will be fought in court, while customers can continue paying with Visa. If Amazon doesn't apply this rule equally on all payment contractors, there is good leverage for Visa in court.\n\nbelow some additional tidbits from other news reports, which go more into detail...\n\n\"Amazon is blocking UK credit cards from Visa as part of an ongoing battle over \u201cinterchange\u201d fees \u2014 levies charged by card issuers to a merchant\u2019s bank for each transaction. Visa\u2019s interchange fees for transactions between the UK and the European Union (where Amazon UK processes payments) were previously capped at 0.3 percent by EU law. But since the UK left the EU, Visa has been able to hike that fee to 1.5 percent.\n\nHowever, Visa isn\u2019t the only company to make such a change. MasterCard made an identical increase to its interchange fees before Visa, but it hasn\u2019t been blocked by Amazon. It\u2019s not entirely clear why Visa has been singled out. It may simply be a strategic decision on Amazon\u2019s part \u2014 to hurt one company instead of taking on an entire industry. Or there may be specific complications in Visa\u2019s payment policies. For example, Bloomberg notes that the company has increased interchange fees for e-commerce sites, while reducing fees in other areas, like education and real estate purchases. It\u2019s not clear if policies from MasterCard or other card issuers make similar distinctions.\"\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786966/amazon-visa-credit-card-ban-alternatives-fees"

Read this explanation first:**\\n\\n>ARM licenses its [ISA](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets) and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.  \\nApple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.  \\nYes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.  \\nStock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them \"",

Family of Apps:\n\nRevenue:\n\n2021: 32.8 billion\n\n2022: 31.4 billion (-4%)\n\nNet Income:\n\n2021: 15.9 billion\n\n2022: 10.7 billion (-33%)\n\n2. Reality Labs ( this is the one of they are supposed to be growing and are sinking a ton of money into)\n\nRevenue:\n\n2021: 877 million\n\n2022: 727 million (-17%)\n\nNet income:\n\n2021: -3.3 billion\n\n2022: -4.3 billion (-23%)\n\nThe losses from their Reality segments has really accelerated and they currently spent around 9 billion dollars of Capex compared to last years quarter which was around 5.4 billion.\n\nOverall looking at the fundamentals its still pretty ugly. The balance sheet also got a bit uglier from their current assets taking a big dip due to the cash they\u2019re burning on this Reality Labs investment. Both current liabilities and total liabilities took a sizable increase. The good news is that they can afford these hits due to the balance sheet being clean. \n\nThe stock is still down over 50% from its highs even after this after hours jump. My guess is that either the stock has already so much bad news priced into it that people just really don\u2019t care about these losses. Most likely its the 40 billion stock buyback that causing the stock to balloon after hours which is a buyback that will eliminate 10% of their total shares. There could have also been guidance that I did not see as I did not listen to the earnings call.\n\nOverall very ugly quarter from a fundamental standpoint. Not interested in the stock and especially not interested after the after hours move lol. Just going to continue to stay away and continue to let Zuckerberg bleed money on these ridiculous goggles that nobody is buying."

On Wednesday, the Amazon founder tweeted a photo of the November 2006 magazines cover, which featured a photo of Bezos at age 42 behind the text, Amazons Risky Bet. The cover story was about why Wall Street executives doubted that Amazon Web Services, then a brand-new on-demand cloud computing service, would ever succeed. I have this old 2006 BusinessWeek framed as a reminder, Bezos, now 58, wrote in the tweet. The risky bet that Wall Street disliked was AWS, which generated revenue of more than $62 billion last year.\\n\\n\\nIn 2006, Amazon was only worth a mere $10 billion, according to Businessweek  and investors and analysts were losing confidence in Bezos promises. The article called out Bezos for going on an ill-timed spending binge, noting that his investments in new technologies like cloud computing were up 52% since January '",

I dunno.\n\nI also saw a story yesterday about some Amazon retail stores attempting unionization and $25/hr was one of their demands. I didn't have time to read it though so I don't know if that is the case or if the author just didn't know that retail and fulfillment are not the same thing. If retail was accurate they could be related. Amazon is not going to tolerate unions. If a warehouse or retail store unionizes today, tomorrow they will begin the process of closing that fulfillment center. There are already plans in place to be able to redistribute work to other FC's due to weather. We can close a warehouse immediately and indefinitely and not skip a beat."

I know local hardware stores are able to stay in business because sometimes you pay for their expertise and experience (the kind of shit 5000 fake Amazon reviews and 3 real ones dont show you)...\n\nI also don't think it's traditionally capitalism to have a monopoly like Amazon given free reign, it never ends well for the consumer.... The amount Amazon and their warehouses even contribute to societies is also questionable, are the just moving the goal posts out further since Amazon doesn't pay fair taxes, cost of living goes up but the pay is average at best and working conditions are brutal...\n\nI had the idea of a delivery/logistics company that caters solely to small businesses for convenience (which is sort of like doordash for retail shit I guess)? That's about all we can hope for to match Amazon convenience, which seems to be their biggest advantage."

Something like half of businesses in a mall arent \"real.\" They are actually loss leaders designed to boost traffic for the mall itself so they can make money from the other retailers in rent. The amounts vary per mall. \n\nI bring this up to point out that Amazon is probably using these spaces for marketing... seriously doubt they expected them to make money on their own. If they made a buck then great, but I doubt that was the driving theory. \n\nBrick and mortar dying has nothing to do with Amazon. They would have been in the same position if Amazon didnt exist. It would have been Target or Walmart or myleftshoe.com who took the market and we would still be in the same place they are today.\n\nIf you want to blame anyone for success of Amazon, blame whoever gave us the laws of thermodynamics.

When it does split in May, I do anticipate a bit of tailwinds, so I look forward to the coming months. \n\nAnd yes, I think Apple and Microsoft are sound investments for the same reasons.

You asked above if dividend stocks are \u201cbetter for long term\u201d but again this depends on your investment strategy.  If you\u2019re looking for income, yes, dividend stocks will give this to you.\n\nJust beware and take with a grain of salt what you read on here and most importantly, do your own due diligence on the stocks recommended here rather than dumping your money in blindly.  Yes, Amazon and Google are great companies for long-term portfolios, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019re the right companies for you, nor are they going to provide quick solutions to counteract the losses on your 401k.  In this downtrendjng market, I consider it a success if you can at least have your losses match those of the indexes (I.e.

But because Amazon has their fingerprints on everything, one bad segment could really hurt their projected outlook.\n\nFrom a company perspective, Amazon is stronger than ever. Don't mistake stock price with the company's outlook. Amazon will continue dominating and growing. Earnings report don't determine the direction of a company. It's just if you have been investing into Amazon the past year, your money has basically earned you a negative return considering that index funds would have pushed your portfolio much higher. \n\nThe way I see it, long-term investors have nothing to worry about. Amazon/Apple aren't going away. Short-term, there are much better opportunities elsewhere for your money to grow. \n\nPersonally, best blue chipper IMO is MSFT. Focused on what they know, continuously growing at high rates with their cloud services being a strong focus. Profit margins are absolute bananas. Last year, $60 billion profit on $155 billion revenue. With many companies using their services more than ever at an alarming rate, I like MSFT's lack of dependency in supply chain issues that Apple and Amazon has to deal with and rely on heavily."

     "These numbers don't do the company justice --- frankly.\n\nThey didn't miss on the EPS because of a lack of execution --- they missed, specifically, because of: wage increases, doubling down on fulfillment, supply constraints, etc...\n\nBeyond that, Advertising revenue continued to grow (around $8.1 Billion for the quarter) and AWS continues to be a market leader, with around 41% share of the global cloud business. \n\nPrime Video continues to show signs of solid adoption as well. \n\nBottom line on the Q3 earnings, from my perspective: Yes, it was a miss on EPS, no question, but the company is executing on all fronts --- the out of control items (wage increases, supply constraints, trucker shortages) those will be resolved with time, and when they are, Amazon will be positioned phenomenally well for the future as they are re-investing now.\n\nNOTE: In the 4th quarter guidance, the company is anticipating spending about $4-6 Billion (Around $11.50 per share) on wage increases, fulfillment, delivery and delivery expansion.\n\nIf you figure that the company, on average, has spent --- since covid began --- about $2-4 billion per quarter, over six quarters, to position themselves for the future --- that is about $23 EPS on the low end and $46 EPS on the high end that the company has reinvested into itself rather than the bottom line (not including the $4-6 billion they are expecting to reinvest into themselves in Q4 2021). Where I am going with this comment is that this is where you cannot miss the forest for the trees with Amazon. They could have easily focused on EPS, which would have certainly grown share price in the short term, rather than reinvesting and taking some pain now to position themselves and their stock growth for the long term!\n\nFacts don't lie --- eventually they will get thru the pandemic issues and related costs and the profit spicket will be turned on....\n\nMY view doesn't change, for the long term, in that Amazon and Google should absolutely be a central part of everyone's portfolio, in my opinion. I see nothing that is going to change my mind!\n\nGood luck investing to all."

Long term holds that I don't plan on looking at or touching too often.  The question I have is - what is the reason do to do this rather than just put it all in some index fund like VTI?  Am I better off just throwing all of these funds in an index fund like that? Realistically the chances of these stocks beating the overall market seem to be slim. Pardon my ignorance if this is an obvious question!\\n\\n  \\nFor transperancy, I was planning on putting \\\\~70% of my funds into index funds (VTI and SCHD) anyway, and using the other 30% for specific stocks.  Is it better to just put 100% into ETFs?\"",

You simply cannot ship fast and reliably elsewhere.  They cannot penetrate Asia plus now physical stores are re opened so they have a lot more competition.  Apple has no such competition, really.  Amazon I consider the #4 best mega cap after AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL.  Meta and Netflix are kicked out of FAANG so now it is GAAM, AMAG, MAAG or MAGA (oh no, not that!)\n\nI admit though I alm ost always pnly buy stocks that pay dividends. To me that shows management isn't so selfish and greedy.  Giving back to shareholders including buybacks, which AAPL does in a major way, secures my trust.   \n\nAs for META we will see if the Metaverse ever works for them. In the meantime they have major problems though Instagram is still very strong. But for how long? Instagram is already starting to annoy me."

     "So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.\n\nThe truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?\n\nThe answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.\n\nIn the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.\n\nWhich brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.\n\nIn 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s..."

Mostly so to create an AI that can understand the user\u2019s surroundings and can be used in both AR glasses and autonomous vehicles. Tim Cook himself has mentioned they see this as their hardest problem, but one they intent to solve. Other than that AAPL in general is a great stock to own.\n\nW.r.t. green energy I\u2019d recommend Fluence (FLNC), which is a global leader in utility battery energy storage. The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play."

But I'm sticking with it because I'm already in the green since I bought post-dividend cut and perhaps they will surprise us with something strategically special. If not, I'll just keep collecting the half-decent divvy and hope for slow gains.\n\nBrookfield has a narrow but solid strategy. They have a decent asset growth plan and have access to relatively cheap capital through Brookfield parent. They know how to manage merchant power assets and with the knowledge they are building on the renewable side, I think they will provide decent long term returns (but no crazy beta) over other merchant generators.\n\nI'm also in MSFT and AMZN but don't have any special insights/theses that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere."

  "Text": "b'I left a job last year and rolled over both my Traditional & Roth IRAs.  Ive since bought Amazon,  Apple, Tesla, Visa, Norvo Nordisk (NVO) stocks (among others) and have been able to write covered calls averaging about $300 a week in premium.  \\n\\nI look for CCs with at least one standard deviation from the current price or 85% likelihood of profit with a ~.2 Delta.  I then buy 1-3 stock shares per week with the premium.  \\n\\nIve had a couple of CCs redeemed and I usually just re-buy the same stock and sell new CCs. \\n\\nIs this a viable strategy long term?'",

     "As long as the strike is at a price where you would be comfortable selling your position, I think CC's are hard to argue against. Traditionally your enemy is taxes but in an IRA that is irrelevant.\n\nI also really don't see a reason not to write very far otm CCs on your heavier positions if you're at all concerned with the capped upside that others on this post have highlighted. I look at something like NVDA where an EOM 350C is $60 as a good example of this. Seems like free money to me.\n\nCash secured puts, which are more or less the inverse of a covered call, could also be worth looking into for you. They require some more meticulous planning as you really need to be comfortable with the entry price should you get exercised but if you're using the amount of cash required to make strategies like this worthwhile there is no excuse for not doing your homework."

Losses are mostly due to greed and to less extent because of bad entry.After every session i manage to finish with at least 30% profit. \\n\\nQuestion is:Am I missing something in the great scheme of things?

Speaking of Amazon, their chart moved quite differently in 2016 than it does now.\n\nMarket moves up and down on news, news that you can't predict accurately without insider information.

     "In my opinion theyre all expensive companies. They trade with high multiples of market to book value and price/earnings/CF metrics. Not to say it isnt justified given their performances are phenomenal but all upside predictions are pricing in growth using assumptions and it is very possible they can drop a significant amount still. Although they are cheaper than before i wouldnt compare to previous levels as it wouldnt mean much.\n\n I prefer to pick my investment without using as little assumptions as possible: I picked META at $92 (250B cap at the time, 180B assets,  $105b tangible, 60B cash and marketable securities, strong FCF on a TTM, strong rev and margins close to peak) but im getting ready to sell incase things go south since things seem to be going to well for my liking.  I also chose to invest in DIS (got in at $90ish) instead of NFLX although retrospectively i would have done much better doing the opposite, but i still think it is better from a risk/reward perspective."

All three of those are still going on, but I don't know if it's quite enough to maintain the massive growth of the past. Users have such high expectations of Netflix, so Netflix has to spend so much money to keep up, especially when there are competitors."

     "I have a great degree of respect for Netflix as a tech company because they have been a legitimate innovator in terms of building a very intelligent SoA system, tons of microservices, their architecture and blogs are very fascinating reads to see how a world class organization handles it's data and systems. They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.\n\nHowever today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.\n\nMiddle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.\n\nNetflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. \n\nI think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience. A true event that they have to capture at the designated time because otherwise they feel left out when their peers are talking about it."

Their clueless execs have pledged to keep increasing content spend, which they can't afford, and soon, won't be able to finance either.  And content costs will be bid up by their much richer competitors.  \n\nThey hit customer saturation several years ago, and hid it with their silly metrics.  They hit price saturation at covid re-opening.  So they can't grow subs, and they can't charge them more... but they have to.  Their funky and false way of claiming \"profitability\" won't hold up to tougher scrutiny.\n\nThey're doing their usual shell game of pretending there's growth with the shiny object of ad-tier.  But you don't make an ad-service that requires customers to sign up and pay.  That's why they had to refund all their advertisers.  And the ad-tier will cannibalize their existing subs/pricing anyway."

     ">It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers.\n\nIt's not a vicious cycle, it's theoretically a virtuous cycle when done correctly. In fact, it is the bedrock of Netflix's business model. [Check out Netflix's flywheel](https://jenvandermeer.org/2020/06/09/netflix-business-model-teardown/)\n\nYou cannot compare Google and Netflix. They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)\n\nAlso, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).\n\nTheir gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. \n\nTLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't. Very different companies."

For one people are holding to their cars for longer. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/americans-holding-onto-their-cars-longer-than-ever.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/28/americans-holding-onto-their-cars-longer-than-ever.html)\n\nThis means the need for autoparts will be higher. \n\nSince in theory a new car will not need as much maintaince. \n\nIn fact, that article came out in 2015, if you look at their revenue growth:\n\n[https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/orly/financials/](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/orly/financials/)\n\nIt's pretty solid. Nothing crazy, but they are still growing like 7%ish a year. \n\nYou'll notice another import factor, the number in 2020. \n\nDuring the pandemic, the supply chain wrecked the new car market. This has a ripple effect. It means people will continue to hold onto used cars, but also this impacts the car rental market. Since they were holding onto used cars for longer, there as more demand for autoparts. \n\nThis is because of the way warranties work on cars. You usually get 3 years or X amount of miles for full coverage. So it's in the advantage of rental car companies to buy new and sell used."

Morgan analysts wrote in a note published Friday.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s U.S. retail business is the \"fastest growing at scale,\" the analysts wrote.\\n\\nAfter 9 months of consolidation, amazon should be finally able to break out. AWS and advertising keep growing, and amazon shipping operation can now challenge UPS, Fedex and USPS. For e-commerce, it is still a leader that none of the any other company can match or catch up. For the past 2 weeks investors were slowly rotating back to the established growth big tech stocks, so amazon should be able to break ath this month.\\n\\nThanks for the awards.'",

Retailers will bear the burden of this lobbying, and Amazon will have an increased cost advantage when their workforce is automated and competing against a wage earning workforce."

Walmart has a history as a company that forces employees to work without overtime, pays them little enough or limits hours intentionally for employees to rely on government programs, and works to undercut brands by driving them out of business  after striking some deal of being their primary if only source of their product. That\u2019s why I prefer target. They may not be 100% right but there\u2019s a reason why target cost a bit more than Walmart\u2019s very cheap prices."

     "Loads of good comments here but I think what a lot of folks are missing is that Walmart isn't a store for middle income + earners, it's a bargain based retailer that targets primarily the lower income brackets. These are the individuals who cannot afford the higher cost of goods sold by Amazon. Also, these lower wage earners typically purchase in person rather than online. Many don't have credit cards or even bank accounts and strictly deal in cash. \\~20% of the population only deal in, or specifically prefer, cash.\n\nAs we've seen over the last few decades, the middle income earning bracket is shrinking from over 60% to under 50% while the low and high income brackets are expanding. What this means is that companies who typically benefited from middle and higher income earners will not experience the growth of customer base that a lower income targeting company would. Obviously the margins are greater the higher up you go on the wage ladder but Walmart isn't in exactly the same retail space that Amazon is. \n\nI think Walmart will continue to see growth for quite some time, especially during a recession. And they will also have arguments that supporting Walmart over Amazon benefits the working class because they won't swap their employees for robotic machinery (at least yet). We all saw the impact of the 'Made in America' campaigns."

  "Text": "b'https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/andy-jassy-on-inflation-surcharge-amazon-cant-keep-absorbing-costs.html\\n\\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company needed to add a fuel and inflation surcharge to deal with rising costs tied to inflation, the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine. At a certain point, you cant keep absorbing all those costs and run a business thats economic, Jassy told CNBCs Andrew Ross Sorkin in a Squawk Box interview on Thursday. Amazon has tried to assume all those costs wherever possible, Jassy said, but it became increasingly untenable as the pandemic continued and after Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year. On Wednesday, Amazon imposed a 5% fee to U.S. third-party sellers who use its shipping and storage services. The surcharge will go into effect in about two weeks for sellers who use Amazons Fulfillment by Amazon program. Merchants pay to have their inventory stored in Amazons warehouses and to make use of the companys supply chain and shipping op'",

     "It depends what you mean. As others have said, its unlikely Amazon will exist as it does indefinitely.\n\nIt is likely that others will continue to try and cut-in on its territory just as is happening to Netflix with streaming. No advantage is indefinite. Though size and capital do secure a certain amount of future proofing as far as tech advancements go, it doesn't prevent against competitors for market share. It it pretty easy to imagine AWS being spun off into a separate company, or any number of other Amazon's divisions for that matter. Look at the history of companies like Westinghouse or Paramount. Even if those companies, in some form exist, or even have the same name as they did, they often change, or take on other business as acquisitions or simply the development of continuing to deploy capital effectively to different opportunities. \n\nThere is a limit to what consumer markets amazon can serve based on its cost-benefit ratios(consumer, employee, owner). Which is why other companies are able to stake out their own claims in different regions with what we perceive as copycat or derivative business models faster than Amazon can grow there. (Coupang, Jumia, BABA, JM, Pindoduo, OZON, Flipkart). Some like Walmart(with Flipkart experience) and Target have a pretty good chance of broad competition in the US market down the line, and other companies have their own chances in their respective niche. Think Williams-Sonoma.  I do think anti-trust regulation is unlikely the way politics in USA work and with how anti-worker pro-business most politicians are. I would love unionization for all Amazon workers. I do think that is maybe the only legitimate threat to the fundamental business model in the USA, which as you may be aware is dependent on low-cost labor both domestically and abroad. I don't see Amazon's dominance declining significantly for the next 8 years or so, possibly even 15. Though there any many more unknown unknowns than known unknowns, so i could always be wrong."

Sears just went out of business in the last 5 years. Its business model wasn\u2019t current for the last 30 years or so, but entrenched market positions can stay alive for a long time. \n\nBy the time Sears failed, the economy had changed radically around it. (Several times!) My sense is that Amazon won\u2019t ever fail *in this economy*\u2014 it will take some big changes in the economy that we can only guess at now. \n\nWhat changes might come? \n\nNanotechnology and active assemblers would make the \u201cshipping manufactured goods\u201d business a dinosaur. \n\nAI-driven autonomous corporations that could manage their own logistics might decentralize the things that Amazon has done so well for us so far. \n\nNearer-term, a congressionally mandated split-up separating the AWS cash cow from the steady smaller margins of Amazon proper might change its velocity, but probably not its market advantages. AWS is a F powerhouse.\n\nI\u2019m curious what anybody else has to say!"

With a recent tech spike I ended up selling my position in Meta(135-240), Amazon(94-122), and Microsoft(240-305). Since everyone is talking about an upcoming recession in the late 2023 would it be wise to wait off to buy back in assuming the market will crash.\\n\\nI am aware that in a long run the stocks Im looking to buy will most likely thrive in a long run such as Apple, google, Microsoft, Tesla. Im just looking for the best opportunity considering the circumstances.'",

     "I think there are several reasons to it.\n\n1. Moat. Amazon has a well-established moat in several of its core businesses. Tesla is said by some to have one of the strongest moats ever: data, software and hardware for FSD. This will give them a massive edge in the FSD segment which is huge. Others say they have no moat and their millions of miles of data is rivalled very well by billions of virtually driven miles; their software and NPUs are rivalled by e.g. NVDA's DRIVE suit. For Amazon, there is no real debate on whether they will dominate their given business segments.\n2. History. Amazon has arguably a longer history as a company which has gone through several boom-bust cycles, hence they have \"proven\" they are able to navigate rough waters. History is extremely important in the stock market and a long-lasting company with a stable management is worth a lot. And then you have Elon Musk.\n3. China. Tesla sold 1/3 of their cars in China (of the last quarter). China is the biggest car market in the world and its plans to include EVs into their everyday life are set in stone (5-year plans). It is, however, a little risky to have such huge business in China nowadays. On the contrary, it is a big benefit to have revenue streams in different currencies and be diversified geographically; not only does it increase the TAM you can capture but it also helps vs currency devaluations. Amazons business is concentrated to US and EU mostly. Highly regulated markets, which is a benefit also.\n4. Debt interest. This is related to many other indicators and shows how \"trusted\" corporations are by big banks. Amazon's effective interest rate (latest twelve months) is \\~1.4%, for Tesla it is more than double that with \\~3.3%. Hence, Amazon is not only able to refinance debt for lower levels, the market is trusting Amazon more than Tesla if it comes to lending money. If you want to compare two companies, first thing to do is compare the interest they pay on the debt they issue. According to this, the valuation must be higher for Amazon, because they are less likely to default.In other words, Tesla incorporates much higher levels of risk into your portfolio than Amazon, even though you pay roughly the same for their earnings. From a risk-perspective, Tesla is the worse deal here.\n\nOfc there are many reasons besides the metrics you and I discuss here that are important. I should clarify that I own shares of both companies."

     "Wow. There's a lot to unpack here. \n\nFirst, you're comparing a company with over 400b in revenue (Amazon) to a company with around 14b in revenue (Tesla)\n\nSecond, the only reason the price of Tesla is this high would be future earnings, it's definitely not worth this market cap on current earnings. Which leads to...\n\nThird, you're saying because they only have 1% of the auto market, their future growth prospects are bigger, but many analysts are saying that Tesla is starting face much higher competition in the EV market. Some are better cars at lower prices without a 6-12 month wait.\n\nVW, Ford, Audi, Kia and Hyundai are putting out some great EVs now. Even Musk has acknowledged Hyundai's progress on the market.\n\nTheir future growth always depended on going beyond cars. Their market cap wouldn't be justifiable if they are just a car company. Self-insurance of their cars, autopilot tech (which seems to be failing), and information gathering, battery tech, charger network, are areas they need to grow and monetize."

     "Quite a few things to unpack here:\n\n> So what other company and stock can we compare that is as at the same size as Tesla with very high growth prospects and is widely considered a good business AND a good investment? Amazon!\n\nThese are in completely different industries, with different characteristics, capital requirements etc. It makes zero sense to compare them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So to sum it up, Tesla is actually less richly valued than Amazon based on current and 2023 earnings multiples, the analysts have consistently underestimated Tesla despite revising earnings estimates up while analysts have consistently overestimated Amazon despite revising earning estimates down, and Tesla earnings are more certain than Amazon's. As a reminder, Tesla has much more room to grow with only 1.5% of the car market compared to Amazon's 40% share of online retail.\n\nTesla's estimation if you look at them use a high multiple growth combined with the same margin as it has now. Given that the cheapest Tesla is 46k, there is a limit to how far you can grow (which would be around 2-3m cars for Tesla with their current lineup). Additionally while Tesla does have room to grow, they are valued as though they would have 10m sold cars with twice the margin, ASP and valuation as Toyota. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Based on my own estimate, I believe Tesla will actually accomplish 2023 earnings of $23.81 per share (compare to analyst consensus of $14.51) by expanding revenue over 50% in 2023 with new factories ramped up in Berlin and Austin, gross margins well in excess of 30% due to economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies at their new factories as well as near 100% margin software sales, while operating expenses grow slower than revenue growth. I\n\nWhy do you think they will grow by 50%. Berlin and Austins have problems ramping up. Gross Margins (which are meaningless in car manufracturing due to the labor cost) will go lower as most commodities have increased significantly. Furthmore, the Tesla Model 3's growth profile is slowing by a significant margin in the last quarter. I think it is actually more likely for Tesla to have no growth in 2023, than to have 50% given their struggles with the factory ramp ups outside of China. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In other words, the trend of analysts underestimating Tesla combined with Tesla's relatively reasonable valuation multiple (as discussed above) could provide a tailwind to the stock over the next 12-16 months and take it to new highs.\n\nTesla's valuation looks reasonable, but are not if you include the costs that are associated with being a car manufacturer. Given the headwinds of the economy, inflation (rents and food are still rising), an aging line-up without any refreshes and the FED hiking interest rates (making car loans more expensive), I don't think that Tesla will grow in 2023. \n\nI also think that Tesla is similar to Cisco. A great company, that was just too promising. Here is my prediction. Tesla will not see ATH for the next decade."

     "Lots of differences to consider here, but at the end of the day whether one or the other is overvalued or undervalued really depends on your projections. Personally I like AMZN, but I don't like TSLA, so let me try to explain why...\n\nArguably AMZN's revs are higher quality because the segment that makes all the money (AWS) is recurring, business essential and operating in a sector of the economy with secular growth tailwinds. TSLA's revs on the other hand aren't recurring, largely tied to consumer health and vehicle sales trends and not in a sector with similar secular growth tailwinds (personal vehicle sales). You could argue EVs have growth tailwinds which I agree with, but in years to come when all automobiles sold are EV that distinction will disappear and then TSLA will just be a regular car company like all the others.\n\nI think many investors would also argue that AMZN has significant room for margin expansion and that today's earnings don't fairly represent AMZN's earning potential. TSLA however already has sector-leading margins and those will almost certainly come under pressure with increased competition.\n\nMy issue with TSLA's valuation is that unlike tech the automobile industry has always been a very competitive place to operate and the consumer is highly segmented. You can't expect TSLA to dominate the automobile industry in the same way we might expect AMZN to dominate ecommerce and cloud services. TSLA's brand isn't going to appeal to every demographic and TSLA isn't going to capture a disproportionately large percentage of the market.\n\nBut if you don't think TSLA is going to face significant competition then it's probably a good buy honestly, but that's not because of the growth potential, but because of the margins. The reason big tech can sustain such large valuations isn't their revs, but their insanely high margins which are due to a lack of competition. Toyota has similar revs to GOOG for example but their valuation is no where near GOOG's because they can't demand the same margins. This is the fundamental risk with TSLA and why I don't care about growth projections. If TSLA is fairly valued it will have much more to do with competition and margins. I worry about both."

Given the current growth rates Tesla won't hit that 50% annual growth, and the more cars they make the harder it will get. \n\nAdditionally their car lineup is aging rapidly and the growth rates currently are very similar to that of the S a few years ago. Chances are high, that unless they introduce a new refresh that they growth will stall at around 2m cars -  making them overall overvalued."

They spent a crazy percent of earnings trying to either get ahead in existing industries or expand into new ones. Now consider tesla, who has excellent pricing power, revenue growth and innovative edge on things like self-driving tech. VW and other legacy car manufacturers are expanding into the EV space. VW in particular seems like a candidate to eat into tesla\u2019s EV market dominance. VW is aggressively ramping up EV production and has more than 4X the revenue of tesla. I think tesla will remain in the lead for EVs but will lose some dominance in the next few years. Tesla\u2019s PE is currently 20X higher than VW, so im more optimistic on amazon over tesla."

And so I think it is just a matter of time before phones and laptops get replaced with glasses.\n\nThe question isn't whether AR/VR is the future, it is whether or not Facebook will be able to beat Apple in introducing this disruptive technology at a smartphone scale."

They had one big day post-split and then got killed initially. It was Tesla's addition to the S&P that re-sparked it.\n\nDisclosure: I was very little when dot.com was going on. It's possible there were times back then where you had a split and stocks continued running for a while after them. \n\nI just don't think that'd be the deal here. If Amazon can continue and have a big month this month, it's probably mostly due to something else (and the S&P and Nasdaq likely had a month similar to March this year then)."

Aside from running the servers, the company has almost no costs, because anything not part of the corporate skeleton staff is based off the independent contractor model, where there is no accountability, no protection, minimal legal recourse, yet through a loophole, THEY, not ME as a driver determine the pay for services rendered, even though in almost any other sector, and any other case, the person performing the services sets their rates/does their billing.\n\nThey completely exploited every aspect of the order-a-ride system, and they're still at a loss.\n\nAvoid at all costs.\n\nedit: (obviously, a minimal level of functionality is there.

     "Firstly, PE and PB don't \"determine which stocks to buy\". At best they should be seen as metrics to better understand how other market participants are valuing a stock.\n\nThe way you might use PE and PB to help determine which stock to buy would be to compare your valuation with the market's. Eg, if you think paying 20x earnings (20 PE) for a company today is a fair price, but the market is valuing that same company at 15x earnings (15 PE) then it might suggest that it's underpriced \u2013\u00a0at least based on your analysis. But there is no simple rule like if a stock trades for 10 PE you should buy.\n\nPE and PB are also extremely fuzzy metrics. There are lots of reasons why a company might have very high or very low PE & PB without it being a reflection of mispricing. And for a lot of stocks PE and PB are basically useless.\n\nYour understanding of PE and PB is correct, but I suspect you're lacking the depth of understanding to use these metrics productively. I'm happy to try to answer any specific questions you might have, but keep in mind this stuff is really difficult and takes a long time to understand. Even when you've been doing this for years there are still things you learn all the time which can help you value companies better.\n\nHowever, if you're just looking to make a few casual investments you're generally fine to use PE as a sanity check. Eg, if you're buying a solid company and it's trading around a market PE then even if you're not getting the best deal, it's also unlikely you're making a massive mistake."

No, you need to figure out which parts aren\u2019t implemented yet by using the services, discovering something isn\u2019t working, searching for it, and finding a 2 year old thread promising that specific thing you were going to depend on will be implemented soon.

Forget about hiking interest rates, staying the same for \"high and longer\" will continue to cause massive deposit outflow from banks. You are at the mercy of an unhinged Fed if you own bank stocks. The Fed's actions for the past 2 months were wrong and excessive. J Pow's most recent testimony is highly destabilizing.

     "Everything you said makes makes sense and is all technically sound, but 2 things that need to be said about Costco are:\n\n\u2022 Brand affinity & love: Costco has earned consumer trust through many years and deliberate strategy. This can\u2019t be replicated (easily) and underpins all of its retention/stickiness/recurring membership model factors. Personally, it will be a cold day in hell before I cancel my membership and not spend hundreds there per month, and is the first place I shop for many consumer durables categories\n\n\u2022 Private Label success: Related to point above, they\u2019ve excelled at their PL business with Kirkland that\u2019s really strong reputation, quality and also they\u2019re able to drive enough volume to be cost competitive too"

With other retailers creeping up on Costco\u2019s wages, this is no longer the case and Costco\u2019s quality does diminish here. Managers at Costco also have had increasingly high turnover, so the best and the brightest are also not becoming managers internally. This may take years to play out, but it will no doubt have an effect on the company culture as a whole. Many companies have lost their way but continually rewarding the shareholders and squeezing their staff year over year has been Costco\u2019s go to since going public."

     "Fantastic summary, though I will say I disagree on one point: I think technology WILL serve costco in the future. I work in robotics and spent years on automation for logistics and material movement. Automated fork trucks that can service high bay rack storage while operating in non-human exclusion zones are JUST starting to be launched in the market. With costscos healthy margin and cash reserves, in the next 1-3 years, I believe they will begin using these technologies which will bring down their operational costs of logistics by some degree, and significantly increase labor stability (as the skilled labor of a fork truck operator is becoming significantly more difficult to find, train and retain). Additionally, warehouse management software companies are starting to shift towards integration with autonomous mobbile robots, automated picking and transit systems, etc. Essentially there are three or four technologies that are going to be unlocked in the next 1-3 years, AND the centralized management systems for material movement and logistics are becoming more integrated.\n\nTLDR: the one thing I disagree about is Costco will not be served by new tech. Technology developments and advanced in material movement and logistics are coming to real widespread commercial applications in the next 1-5 years that will decrease costs and increase predictability, Costco is uniquely positioned to be served by this."

Their eyes go wide when I tell them that my tire blow out was taken care of by prorating the wear and tear for a new one.\n\nBut it comes down to this, my single friends do not salivate at the appeal. They don't want to \"buy their clothes where they buy their groceries.\" They would rather pay at a Chevron than wait in a Costco gas line. Would rather have their products shipped via amazon or buy groceries at a hip store like Trader Joes rather than have to deal with hoard of families on a Sunday or food spoiling due to their enormous size.\n\nI think Costco has a great 20 - 40 years, but they need to start pivoting and I don't know if they can."

     "Great write up. I do think you have maybe undersold. Walmart/Sams club. Now I know that most people who read that will be coming with pitchforks, so let me clarify. Costco usually beats Sams head to head on most products and thier stores are nicer. However Sams offers a lot of products costco doesn't and when your a plus member at sams you get free curbside deliver with the app, which costco doesnt offer at all. Also Sams is investing heavily in having self checkouts and app based checkouts. Site to store is a thing for Sams and you can order things off the website to be picked up in store. Costco really doesnt have anything like it. Thats said I see cashiers as faster and more efficient, but Sams has some benefits. You might pay a small amount more than costco for head to heads (think like 0.30 on a box of cereal) but in exchange you get a larger variety of products and sizes that are just not available at costco. I wouldn't drop my Sams membership anymore just cause a costco is in the area/came to the area(my prior policy). \n\nWhat I would ding Sams for is there store loc/environment (generally in worse areas than costco), costco does a great job at replicating thier exp at every store. Sams can vary quite a bit, and some of them are bad enough that I would drop Sams based on local stores. \n\nAnyway thats two cents from someone who does both."

Last year their ceo had this to say:\n\n\u201cOn July 26, 2022, L\u00fctke announced immediate layoffs totalling roughly 10 percent of its workforce. In a message to employees, the CEO said the company's planning on growth rates continuing on the trajectory of the past two years \"didn\u2019t pay off\" and forced the company to downsize.\u201d\n\nThis was followed by another round of major layoffs this month, totally 20% of its workforce. \n\nI imagine that huge expense reduction is helping the quarterly profitability numbers but it\u2019s just hard to see why a company who has successfully deployed their software and brings in sizable revenue is bleeding so much money. The words from the ceo make it seem like the glided on Covid excitement for two years but didn\u2019t build out anything too sustainable \n\n[wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopify)"

     "Look at it this way.\n\n\n>seems like I've committed financial suicide but others suggest I've gotten in at the perfect moment when thinking long term?\n\n\nIf you aren't planning on selling any of your investments for about 10 years or so, yes. Keep on adding. It has to get bad before it gets good. \n\nTiming the market is borderline impossible, keep adding, do  not even check your portfolio. \n\nEventually, it may not be this year, but eventually, I'd assume most of your holdings will rebound. \n\nThe main problem is, at the moment, there's a lot of fear in the markets. People are worried about bank collapsing, inflation, stagnation, energy prices, food and more (depending on location), so until the fears subside, the market will go down.\n\nDon't try and time it, just set up an auto-buy, or lower your DCA amount, as long as you're NOT putting in more than you can afford to lose, you'll be fine in the long term. Not next week, or by May. LONG term. Think years ahead."

If you fancy yourself passive, that job is fairly simple. If you fancy yourself a gambler, that's a lot of TA, etc. etc. If you fancy yourself an long term investor, read Aswath Damodaran's work and watch his YouTube content.\n\nThe idea of invested capital, is that it's your excess capital. What else would you do with the excess capital? You'd blow it, so at least you can risk it on an investment to grow into your future. \n\nAnd maybe it never does grow, but again, what else are you going to do with the capital?\n\nYou shouldn't put up the down payment for something you need, it shouldn't be your emergency funds, your bill money, etc. What you invest should be money that if you did not invest, all it would do would sit there needlessly and have time erode it, and/or get wasted.\n\nYour decisions can not be made by another person. It's your money to profit or loose over the duration of your bet. You need to know why you're willing to risk it, and how you're willing to risk it. If you're doing anything beyond a passive bet on positive drift, get ready to make financial literacy and self directing your education towards that your life, at least for the next couple years."

I don't see a 'company' behind SNAP. I just see an optional product that isn't going to change anyone's quality of life.

Fresh stores are substantially larger, ranging from from 25,000 square feet to 45,000 square feet.\\n\\nAmazon is always looking for a way to defend from walmart and target, amazon fresh store is the perfect answer. Amazon keep improving the logistic warehouses and expanding the delivery network, the fresh store will be easily managed and capturing the low margin market share.

     "To give y'all an idea of what it's like in one, they converted a Whole Foods near me into an Amazon Fresh. Has the same atmosphere as a Whole Foods, but at competitive grocery prices. \n\nThere are plenty of workers on the floor fulfilling orders to be delivered and picked up. \nThey offer 2hr same day delivery FREE to prime members.  There are regular checkouts, but I like using their contactless checkout using these tech carts with built in sensors, cameras, a tablet, and scale. You scan in your Amazon account on your phone. As you add items to the cart, the sensors and cameras detect the items and add it to your grocery list on the tablet. Taking things out of the cart queues a prompt on the tablet asking if you're putting it back. Easy. Scales in the cart also pickup weighted items like produce. Once you're ready to checkout, you go to the designated checkout lane for these carts, which queues the tablet to total your items, you review the items, then checkout and it's billed to your Amazon account. Downsides, the cart is heavy because of all the tech, there's only room for two paper bags that they supply, and you can't leave with the cart so you carry your bags from the store to your car. But I love the tech, it's pretty cool."

Kind of at the point where just having this cash in an online savings is enough to cover all my expenses sans rent.\n\nMy income is just about maximized as I have a great paying tech job with good work/life balance, although I think increasing your income is something 90% of this subreddit should be concentrating on instead of trading."

     "The defined outcome strategies I've been using since the beginning of this market downturn are particularly geared towards wealth preservation and reducing risk. \n\nIt's generally a good idea for investors to have a diverse portfolio, regardless of their age. However, the specific mix of investments that is appropriate for you will depend on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here are some general guidelines to consider:\n\n\\- If you are in your 20s or 30s: You have a long time horizon, which means you can afford to take on more risk. It may be a good idea to allocate a higher portion of your portfolio to stocks, which have the potential to generate higher returns over the long term, but also come with more volatility.\n\n\\- If you are in your 40s or 50s: You may be nearing retirement or have other near-term financial goals, so it may be a good idea to start thinking about preserving your wealth. You may want to consider reducing your exposure to stocks and increasing your allocation to more stable investments, such as bonds.\n\n\\- If you are over 60: You may be in retirement or approaching it, so preserving your wealth and generating income will likely be your top priorities. It may be a good idea to allocate a larger portion of your portfolio to less risky investments, such as bonds and cash.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and every investor's situation is unique. It's a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional to determine an investment strategy that is appropriate for you (vs all the 'experts' on Reddit)."

So what I mean is that if I build my model, my goals (longterm for example), my risk tolerance, my future planned income and expenses , stuff like that, + x amount of uncertain things I come to a certain conclusion and plan based of that.\n\nSo that concludes to me starting my buys here (I bought a tiny fraction on Dec 28th), I basically do a simple \"split\" and have my scenarios, I expect good buying opportunities for the future here in 23, but I am also ready to benefit from unexpected outcomes like: It drops a bit more than I expect (which longterm benefits me more anyways), it just chops around for more months even years ( prob the overall worst situation for most guys, no major new ATH or lows, so a lot of +- and patience and patience = time which is the most valuable thing we have , or if it would turn and just go nuts from here, which means I won\u00b4t chase the pump, but the part I invested will be making me money so it\u00b4s a win as well."

     "HOG - Harley-Davidson reported interesting numbers in that their shipments are up as a whole across 2022 from 2021... but behind the curtain we see the real truth. The reason for my post is that motorcycles are a luxury item for most and Harley is one of the most expensive based on cost of entry.   \n  \nInventory at dealers rose by thirteen thousand units from the same time in 2021 after they had spent years trying to knock down those numbers. Sales in the US are down nearly nine thousand units. HDFS, their financial services arm, set aside 51m in Q4 for losses which brought 2022 up to 145m in total.\n  \nFor a brand whose point of entry is over sixteen thousand and typically is in the high twenty thousand range these are continuing to be not good signs. Sales is not be helped by the fact they are continuing their supply chain surcharge which is a thousand or more on their most popular units.\n  \nhttps://investor.harley-davidson.com/news/news-details/2023/Harley-Davidson-Delivers-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results-Successfully-Completing-Second-Year-of-Hardwire-Strategic-Plan/default.aspx   \nhttps://s201.q4cdn.com/697889289/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/HOG-Q4-YE-2022-Earnings-Slides-2.02.23-FINAL.pdf    \n  \nI have no position in their stock, I am just a former owner of their motorcycles and likely a future customer should they choose to remove the surcharge. Dealers are going to be struggling this year and seeing sales decline in the US yet again while inventories are up will put pressure on the dealer network even more. \n  \nOh, on top of all that they will be importing a motorcycle (X350) designed and built in China with only their emblem added to the bike for their riding academy. Harley is no longer able to economically produce bikes they can use for their own riding academy"

     "It seems to me there\u2019s a strong misunderstanding of what a \u2018recession\u2019 really is and what it means for the average person. In simple terms, a recession is a decline in economic activity (GDP), period. It has nothing to do with inflation, and it has nothing to do with the stock market. Obviously there is some correlation between those, as markets *usually* decline during a recession. Recessions can also vary drastically in severity. There\u2019s been many recessions over the last century and most people probably didn\u2019t notice some of them. If your job is stable and you\u2019re not heavily invested in the stock market, does a recession really impact you much directly? Not really. I do not understand all the doom and gloom hype over an impending recession. It\u2019s a normal part of the economic cycle, if one doesn\u2019t come in the next year or two we\u2019ll surely see another on eventually. Stop worrying about it."

Job layoffs are isolated to relatively small industries. Here's a quote from the Wallstreet journal:\n\n \"Employers in healthcare, education, leisure and hospitality and other services such as dry cleaning and automotive repair account for about 36% of all private-sector payrolls. Together, those service industries added 1.19 million jobs over the past six months... By comparison, the tech-heavy information sector, which shed jobs for two straight months, makes up 2% of all private-sector jobs.\""

That doesn't bode well for a difficult recession if one does hit. The other problem lies in that there is still a backlog of product in manufacturing. Lead times are still long to get parts, etc. Companies are mostly doing well in their earnings and profits are flowing in. Tech companies are laying off you say, they also added 1,000's of jobs during COVID. The boom they saw in business was not sustainable. They must cycle down on head count. There is also a strong correlation to cutting jobs and the stock market looking at that move positively.

     "I\u2019d suggest DCA investing in index funds until you understand how to pick stocks. Stick picking is not as simple as buying the stock of a brand you enjoy. It means valuing a company, analyzing financial statements, studying fundamentals, etc. Until you have a strong understanding of stock picking, I\u2019d avoid individual stocks. \n\nThat said, if you really want to study how to pick stocks, read The Intelligent Investor; it\u2019s a fantastic book that should I still a healthy mindset in you. Study the styles of successful investors such as Buffett, Graham, Lynch, Greenblatt, Munger, and so on. Find a strategy that works for you and stick with it. People like to claim it\u2019s impossible to beat the market, but all the people I mentioned above demolished the index over many years. Research shows which strategies work and which don\u2019t. Rather than reinvent the wheel, implement strategies that have a proven track record of performing well (preferably outperforming indices) and providing a safety of principal."

     "Investing is the business of dreams. Nobody wants to own x shares of blank, people just want to get rich so they can live their dream life. \n\nWith that being said, your first investment should be yourself. Grind down any debt with a bad rate, invest in your education and skills, and lastly establish a 6-15 month emergency fund. \n\nOnce that is done I recommend your first $15-20K go into a S&P 500 index (ticker VOO or SPY). This will give you exposure to the top 500 American companies. I have my entire 401K in VFIAX which is a similar fund through Vanguard. \n\nNow comes the fun part. You have skills giving you income and you have a little bite of every delicious apple on the money tree. Now is where you differentiate. Create an investing thesis. That is something you think will drive growth for years to come. I recommend something in your field of expertise, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. \n\nOnce you established a thesis, go through the stocks that are doing business adjacent to that thesis. Look at what they are priced at (P/E), market cap, free cash flow, revenue, net profit, insider buys/sells, general trends/sentiment, investor ratings, and I could go on. Try to find stocks that fit your appetite for risk, and match your temperament. \n\nI was buying GameStop at $7-16/share. But I wasn\u2019t emotionally ready to sell when it peaked at over $400/share. I ended up selling around $60, over 4x my money, but I could have had so much more. You have to learn from your mistakes. \n\nGood luck!"

     "I have been a Schwab customer for over 35 years. Great company with great representatives and excellent free research tools. I suggest you buy a Schwab mutual fund or ETF tied to the S&P 500. That way you will have a nicely diversified holding that tracks the major companies in America. After you learn how to research individual stocks and decide what kind of investor you want to be, ie. Growth oriented, value oriented, both, etc., you can start adding individual companies to your portfolio. Investing can be rewarding and educational as well as fun as long as you understand there will never be guarantees with your purchases. While it is not gambling, there is risk. Doing research and carefully choosing your companies will minimize that risk. The key is to keep adding to your portfolio on a regualr and consistent basis no matter what the market is doing. That is called dollar cost averaging. Hope this helps, getting started can be overwhelming. Mark"

     "\\*Not financial advice\\*\n\n1 - You need to get experience.  Find some trustworthy mentors who have a similar trading style as yourself. I can DM you who I follow if you like.  Search You Tube, talk to some financial advisors near where you live, read some articles, etc\n\nI, personally, would buy XYLD and use the dividend to purchase additional shares each month.  It's dividend is currently at 13% (If I could go back and invest $50-$100 per check)\n\nNext, I would learn how to sell covered calls, and paper trade stocks like TSLA, AAPL, META, GOOG.  In about a year or two you will have a good Idea on how the process works and how you can make money if the stock is going up, going down, or sideways. \n\n I don't believe the stock market outpaces inflation and taxes, so my strategy may be very different than your thinking.\n\nHere is some good advice I received, through various learning sources, over the past year:\n\n\\- Don't trust any advice or advisor.  Take in what they say, learn how to do a fundamental analysis of a company for it's future cash flow, and make your own decision.  You are the one taking all the risk\n\n\\- There isn't a big pool of money waiting for you to get your portion.  A very large number of companies will fail each year, and a large number of companies cannot outpace inflation and taxes.  learn how to be market neutral.\n\n\\- if you aren't willing to put in a lot of time understanding the market and companies, you will most likely fail.  May get lucky from time to time, but over the long term, doomed.  If you don't want to put in the time, stick to what makes you money and focus on that.  Learn to save, and find a financial advisor."

     "dont just blindly buy amazon or apple or google or even VOO or VTI as people here are saying. Learn how ETFs work first before you buy one so you know about how the indexes move the market before you buy some of these bigger companies. Learn to look at valuations and ask yourself a simple question: Why am I investing? Are you wanting additional income stream, multiply your money, insulate yourself until retirement from inflation, make a living on it, or all of the above? If you let us know what you want, people can maybe point you in the right direction. Some of those things are harder than others but at least you can know what kind of strategies people employ. \n\nex: People who tell you to just buy VOO or VTI are not doing you a favor if you want additional income streams.\n\nPersonally, the biggest companies and even monopolies will always be unable to hold their edge into perpetuity. Just look at the East India Trading company or the railroads of the past. Therefore, google, microsoft, amazon etc aren\u2019t great investments to me bc they will neither give me stable dividends, 2-3x my money, nor are they guaranteed to stay as mega corporations until I retire. I would rather focus on speculation and dividend generation. But I know that is an unpopular take here."

If you\u2019re older, you want to be safe and buy the spy or qqq cause it\u2019s a really safe equity. \n\nIf you\u2019re making that little amount of money, no offense, but that\u2019s not really going to compound or do anything sognificant to help reach financial freedom. This is what young people don\u2019t get. They\u2019re investing 1200 a year for 5 years.. that\u2019s only 5-6k. One bad accident happens and you have to tap into that bag and now you\u2019re back to 0\u2026\n\nImagine if you had taken risk and bet $1000 or even more on one bet, and it pays of 100x an snow you have 100k. Compared to the 100 a month into a low yield low risk asset. Yeah, that\u2019s okay if you have a million dollars. Most millionaires and billionaires do that. They buy low risk (or even no risk stuff like bonds) which yield 2-3-4% and they\u2019re happy with that. Cause they\u2019re so rich. But you\u2019re not rich my friend. You can be if you make the right financial decisions. Don\u2019t do what all the young people do and not really take risk. Right now there\u2019s a lot of opportunities. Just be patient and know that it won\u2019t happen in a day. Must be patient. That\u2019s the most important thing in investments. There\u2019s some people that have been doing this for a very long time. They know patience. Young people don\u2019t and blow up their accounts cause they want to get rich tomorrow. No. That\u2019s not how investing works. Then they say everything is a scam and capitalism is a scam. No. That person was just foolish. Don\u2019t be foolish like the majority of young people, and don\u2019t buy $100 of a etf every month, cause you\u2019re not investing millions of dollars. When you have millions of dollars or even a good paying salary, okay start, but right now with your lower wage job, research hot sectors, ask people that seem like they have insider info, and speculate into a company with a lot of potential. Like Tesla 10 years ago. Or Amazon 20 yrs ago. Or apple. Or Bitcoin 10 years ago. Those all 1000x +"

So, yea it\u2019s a fair value\u2026. That said I think the market is due for a correction as it seems the fed is going to get more aggressive,the market by my math is overpriced 14%, and the same math says Amazon should trade flat. If it\u2019s a buy and hold forever it\u2019s about as good a place to put your money as any right now.\n\nObvi, my math means nothing, but it\u2019s how i sanity check pricing and get relative info, actual hard numbers are meaningless and my assumptions can be (and probably are) entirely off. \n\nAnd as always, not to be taken as financial advice and make up your mind as you see fit."

Sell VIAC at 20x. \n\nMeanwhile, who knows what happens to AMZN. If all goes well, buy AMZN at 20x for AWS. Can't happen? It's happened before."

     "I'm not particularly bullish on Amazon right now, due to concerns about their new CEO and their diworsification, but I used to be. For the sake of debate a few bullish arguments could be:\n\n1. Amazon has a history of aggressive re-investment, which artificially inflates their P/E but has proven great for their long-term growth. They used to have a P/E in the thousands, and for quite a while had only negative earnings. They've been investing a lot into infrastructure recently, which may bear fruit over the next few years.\n2. Amazon has AWS, widely acknowledged to be a powerhouse in cloud computing, and growing. It might deserve a trillion-dollar market cap just on its own. Cloud computing may very well define the next decade.\n3. Although their e-commerce arm is not particularly profitable, the plan seems to be to leverage it for digital ads--which have shown to be insanely profitable when pulled off correctly.  They've only just started this.\n4. Amazon has a track record (admittedly, under different leadership) of successfully moving into new markets. Who knows where they'll go next, but I'd hate to be in any market that gets in their crosshairs."

Not only do they make great content but they also had the foresight to create a means to deliver other content via their channels.  Why sub to 10 different streaming services when you can get them all through Amazon?  \n\nAnd that's only part of it.  AWS is killer.  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) is killer.  When it comes to long-term buy and hold I put more weight on where I think the company will be in 10 years vs current fundamentals.

The debt they do have is mostly long term and at a fixed rate, so raising interest rates are not a concern.

Very tempting.\n\nMy concern is that the split occurs as this bear market continues.\n\nSo the killer questions are:\n\n- Does the stock price go down further post split given that the bear market continues for at least a few months if not a year.\n\n- Does the stock price post split stay even until the bear market is over.\n\n- Does the stock price moon and continue to moon through the bear market as investors would be  psychologically drawn to the low price and pile in blindly.\n\nThoughts? Are you buying pre or post split?\n\nAssuming AMZN and GOOG are $100 post split. Can you see that price going down even further IF you were sure the bear market was going to continue for at least 12 months?"

AWS is a great profit center but it's becoming a ultra competitive market with some of the best of the best, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, IBM all competing for business. Whenever you have a competitive market, profit margins erode - which is what will happen with Amazon. \n\n3.) Trees don't grow to the sky. Amazon is such a large market cap of the overall market, and so many desperate parts, that it has become a digital conglomerate, which like the bricks and mortar type, usually don't do well long term. \n\n4.) Their retail business is a low margin, almost loss leader, business. \n\n5.) Streaming business - super competitive and as we have seen with the recent collapse of Netflix and the entire streaming subsector, the profit margin outlook for this subsector is expected to go nowhere but down. \n\n6.) Labor issues - they have one of the largest workforces in the USA. Big problems on this front (unions, etc) and it could become a GM-esque type of problem."

[...] Although IBM refuses to disclose exact numbers, outsiders estimate that it employs well under 100,000 people at its American offices now, down from 130,000 in 2007.\" \n\nInterestingly, \"Depending on the job, the salaries paid to Indian workers are one-half to one-fifth those paid to Americans, according to data posted by the research firm Glassdoor.\"\n\nAre these layoffs happening in the US? It makes a huge difference because are they firing people with average salaries of $80K ($312M in annual cost savings on around $60B in annual revenue) in the US or more like $20K ($78M)? Are we talking a few hundred employees in the US? Seems like a completely non-news headcount change unless we're talking execs being fired. Neither bullish nor bearish."

Apparently Amazon has either not been forthcoming with its proposed construction schedule or Amazon has expanded its growth rate beyond previously disclosed levels.  Regardless of reason (I think both are true), Amazon is unilaterally cratering the largest tile manufacturer in the worlds insane tile production capabilities.  There are literally millions of square feet of tile being made as fast as possible to accommodate Amazons facility expansion needs.\n\nCalls on Amazon."

Funny to see how my examples aged, but my core question is still valid so I post again.\\n\\nI know this kind of a question has been recently often asked on this sub, but the more I read and the more I get confused.\\n\\nThe main counter argument that Ive read is that as a shareholder you actually own a part of the company, which includes its assets but also its cash. Thats true yes, but what can you do from it in reality ? Nothing. We cannot request to trade our stock directly with the company for the asset/cash equivalent. \\nThe only options to get money from your stock are :\\n- company is bought by another one\\n- dividend is distributed \\n- you sell higher than you bought.\\n\\nIf none of the two first options happens, then it seems to be like speculation. You sell higher to someone that expects to also sell higher.\\nAlso lets not forget that companies keep a big part of stocks on their side so the'",

     "There are several ways a company can return value to shareholders other than pay a dividend. \n\nThey can also buyback stock or invest in the business. All of these options are done from cash flows generated by the business. \n\nSomething like snap doesn't generate free cash. So if you own it, you're speculating on it generating cash flows in the future. Since no one knows for sure when or how much this will be, the stock can be volatile. \n\nIn contrast, a company with a regular, consistent cash flow will be less volatile (in theory). Look at CACI for example. No dividend, but does generate very regular cash flows which it reinvests."

     "Not necessarily. Everything is speculation to a degree that is accompanied by different levels of risk. Dividends are typically paid out by company profits and cash flows. Paying out dividends by a company with stable profit and strong retained earnings is desirable, whereas incurring debt to pay those dividends or paying them when in a negative cashflow or profit position is usually a poor choice (giving out more money when youre losing cash). Companies that dont payout their shareholders are adding more to their book value and assets, assuming they profit. Since your shares represent ownership the book value of your investment will increase, but it doesnt necessarily entail the market value of your shares will increase."

     "It's not pure speculation.\n\nAs an investor, you are a part owner of the business. A share represents a claim on the net assets and all future cash earnings of the business. The value of a share is the price you're willing to pay in exchange for all this cash from now till judgment day discounted at an appropriate rate.\n\nIn other words, the value of a share is an expectation of all future cash distributions aka dividends you will receive.\n\nBut value is not price. For any publicly traded company, the price is determined by an auction with a variety of participants. Some participants calculate this expectation and assign an intrinsic value that they bid against, others expect the expectation of others and try to profit from it.\n\nSo the market price is a combination of the *expectation* and *expectation of expectations* (and if you take options, *expectation of expectations of expectations*).\n\nNow you mentioned the price drop of SNAP. This could mean one of two things:\n\n1. People expected others to pay a higher price (the bigger fool), which didn't happen or\n2. People's expectation of future dividends changed\n\nUsually it's a combination of both.\n\nYou also mention cash on balance sheet. It's true that you cannot access this cash as a minority shareholder. So you have an added burden of determining how the management is going to use this cash (reinvestment vs distribution) and when (now, after 5 years, or never) and assign an appropriate discount to that as well. This is equivalent to having your box of gold in Canada (which you can easily access) vs North Korea (good luck with that).\n\nSo while there is an element of speculation involved (with both dividend-paying and non-dividend stocks), there's also an element of aggregate expected business value.\n\nThe challenge for a true investor is to separate these out. Two easy ways to do this are to buy at a significant discount and to hold for a long time."

You are then investing because you feel the revenue they are putting towards company growth will increase the share value faster than the dilution and be a better use of that money than paying it out via dividends.\n\n If you don't think that they are making good use of the money and will increase the value, don't invest.

A dividend changes nothing about the value of a company. \n\nSuppose 2 stocks have identical fundamentals. If one issues a 5% dividend, then that stock will immediately fall 5% while the other won\u2019t. You\u2019re not getting a better deal by receiving the dividend. In many cases you\u2019re getting a worse deal as dividends are often taxed more harshly. You can sell either stock and you\u2019ll end up with the same amount of dollars in the bank.

     "See there are various angles to it, like you mentioned that if you\u2019re just waiting to someone to buy it at higher price than you bought it that\u2019s a speculation . But otherwise let\u2019s say a good company with good investment skills in regards to capital allocation which is different, for example let\u2019s take Berkshire Hathaway the chairman Warren Buffett is a very good capital allocator as compared to someone like me plus he\u2019s a good custodian of my capital as he doesn\u2019t take hefty salaries. So for 100$ in invest in Berkshire I get 22% of compounded returns( his average is 22% since the last 50 years) , now if I invest it in a dividend yielding company where let\u2019s say i get 7% pa of cash first of all I dont get 7$ for my 100$ Uncle sam takes his cut of 30% so the cash i get is 4.90$ which i reinvest in the same company . In this way you can see that I\u2019m losing out on a lot of capital where as Berkshire is reinvesting that same capital without paying me out , we\u2019re just cutting down on alot of steps. So this way the book value of Berkshire increases yearly so my piece of cake/ business is getting biggger and bigger. \n\nSecond example would be something like uber or snap , these companies are really good for the consumer but not for the investors as the capital employed by them has always given -ve returns. So we are just holding onto it for another sucker to buy it at a higher price."

Next year, you might take home $15 billion or $19 billion. \n\nAs the owner, you can choose to pay yourself that $17.6B as a dividend to yourself or reinvest some of it back into the business or pay down some of the outstanding debt. The current owners - all the shareholders - as represented by the Board of Directors decided to pay $7.9 billion in dividends last year.\n\nIt really does not matter to what extent a company does or does not pay dividends.

     "Simple answer is no. Unprofitable companies are speculation. Dividend stocks are just profitable companies with enough cash flow to pay a percentage to their shareholders.  Other companies may choose to put all positive cash into growing the company or buying back shares. Speculation stocks, from my opinion, are specifically stocks that do not generate sufficient cash or even any sales but may do so in future. All companies have risk and an ability to trade at higher prices but a company with strong enough cash flow to pay a Dividend has significantly less risk than a profitable company that does not yet have the income to pay a Dividend.  Even more risk is one who posts losses or no revenue at all. Catch is, sometimes the higher the risk the bigger the rewards.  A rapidly growing company will have the share price make larger percentage moves than an older well established company. Some up and some down. For long-term safe investments, go with dividends. For higher potential reward,  consider the ones that are still developing. Personally I have both, high risk speculative stock I trade and Dividend and ETFs I hold for retirement."

Companies buy the shares back from the general market based off of the goals of the managing committee, but generally with the goal of buying back as many shares as possible at or below a certain multiple, though bad management will sometimes approve share buybacks at inflated multiples just to say they initiated a share buyback (see META).\n\nThe only time you are speculating on a stock is when a stock is unable to generate profits at current margins and are promising better margins once economies of scale kick in.

Not sure about VIG/SCHD: should I combine them? Or just simplify and go 100% TDF? \n\nSecond priority for my taxable portfolio is to continue increasing the weight of my index funds, in particular my small cap value tilts. \n\nOf my index funds: my goal is 40% VTI + 25% VXUS + 20% AVUV (US SCV) + 15% AVDV (ex-US developed SCV) I'm nearly there. But these indices currently make up only 66% of my taxable portfolio, and the rest are individual stocks/sector ETFs. I'd like to make the index fund portion much higher, say 75% by end of year, and 80% end of next year. But I will continue to buy occasional dips in stocks I like, and take profits where needed and redeploy back into index funds.\n\nMy goal is not to preserve my portfolio but growth, so I'm willing to take an extra aggressive approach by tilting the deepest value of the market: small cap value. I bought too many individual stocks, but I'm performing right in line with VT and the S&P 500 so unless I start dramatically underperforming, I'll be okay with it.\n\nIndividual stocks I would like to build bigger positions into:\n\n- MSFT/GOOG for big tech, but only on even bigger discounts from now (< 200 for MSFT or < 80 for GOOG, for instance) to really justify it\n- XOM/PSCE for energy. XOM only if it drops into the 80s/90s.\n- AMD in 50s or lower\n- SBUX in 80s\n- JPM sub 110\n- Possible new position in UNP/DE/CAT only if there is a large downturn\n- New position in a copper play (FCX?)\n\nExit it out if price action turns bullish:\n\n- DIS\n- TGT \n- Trim AMD if it skyrockets irrationally"

All three have been absolutely destroyed because they are small caps, but represent good opportunities. \n\nSkylight is a health clinic M&A company, it jumped yesterday due to the acquisition of One Medical. \n\nCloudMD is an enterprise healthcare service provider, it trades less than 1x revenue and will be profitable in the near term. It also has a very healthy balance sheet.\n\nDiagnos Inc is an AI healthcare company that scans retinas to detect for diabetes. It has deals with Essilor and New Look for service and it is currently building out the network. It should also be nearing profitability by the end of this year. \n\nNot investment advice, do your own research."

The fact that they're messing around with a company that barely crests half a billion in yearly revenue is ignoring it's biggest problem: it's retail operation is getting old and they need to meaningfully derive more value out of it, and/or find a way to make AWS even bigger and more meaningful.   \n\n\nIf they are going to go the Berkshire/Microsoft route and grow by acquisition, they should start acting like a trillion-dollar-plus company and buy Target or Lowes or something meaningful and stop messing around with small caps."

There is still government money pouring into rural broadband. \n\nAIT - Boring company that deals with like transmission fluids and bearings. They raised full year guidance and will do well as more company spend to reshore back in the US. Plus the fact with the labor shortage, they deal with automation machinery and we will see more companies spend in this space. \n\nANET - Still expensive stock, but their return on capital has been amazing for a while. It's really well ran company and the thing about cloud, companies will always need more space. Whenever a company comes up with a new feature, this usually requires new api's/db's etc. In this down market, the forward PE has come down to be a really solid pickup."

     "TMO, DHR, MEDP.  The first two are exceptional businesses, long-term holdings and don't require much mental energy - I don't think about them day-to-day, don't have to think about micromanaging the holdings, etc. MEDP has been a solid performer over the years and their CEO did one of the better insider buys I've ever seen, hoovering up tens of millions of dollars worth of shares in September before the company had an exceptional quarter about a month later and the stock soared about 30%+ in a day.\n\n\"Google & Amazon are very close to their 52 week lows this morning and continue to look like an appealing long term buy\"\n\nWhy does it seem like people are focused on AMZN/GOOG instead of MSFT? If I had to buy a mega cap tech co at this point I'd rather MSFT. Google is almost entirely reliant on advertising, which is a lousy place to be every time there is a downturn - it's still disappointing that several years later the Alphabet conglomerate structure has gone largely wasted as the company never really diversified in the manner that was talked up when it acted like it was going to become a tech Berkshire several years ago. \n\nI think people should consider not just sticking to the playbook of owning tech household names (there's a good chance people won't be able to rely on the same playbook they've relied upon for the last decade in the years ahead); own *some* tech (requiring focusing on best choices rather than \"all the tech\") and have at least moderate diversification to other sectors - there's growth stories outside of tech. What is an appropriate % allocated to tech is going to be different for everyone but I think the sort of 75%+ tech portfolios that may have worked over the last decade aren't going to be appropriate over the next few years, at least."

I don't think Apple is a bad choice but I have always had some skepticism about it being the Oldsmobile or Cadillac of tech. A huge part of its value comes from high end consumer loyalty and if that loyalty fades it would end up very overvalued. Mind you, I'm not saying this will happen, just that it is a risk. With Google I am quite confident that they will stay at the center of innovation for the foreseeable future. My concern there is that the way they are monetized (ads) doesn't have a lot to do with innovation. So, if ad revenue takes a big and lasting hit (which is a known risk) then you could end up with a much bigger version of our well known Not Incredibly Profitable Really Cool Disruptor type of company.\n\nThe other way I could go is just very basic basic products, like food (ADM, Bunge), liquor (MGPI), or electrical utilities (e.g ED, BKH, etc.)."

Inflation is decreasing, unemployment is crazy low, a dollar that\u2019s getting stronger every day, the insane bubbles that never made sense have already done most of their popping (speculative tech stocks, Crypto), and America\u2019s light jog into industrial policy (CHIPS act, infrastructure spending, tons of clean energy incentives) is driving a lot of domestic investment into the real economy.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be the best time for the stock market necessarily, but it\u2019s a very debated topic amongst economists if we are even going to enter a minor recession at all."

They have government contracts as their anchor to get through recessions and limitless growth for commercial. Ranks #1 (above Microsoft and AWS) for worldwide AI software. Robinhood gets a lot of hate but breaks so many barriers in the finance industry. Offering 3% on cash?! I think FTX going down and not being regulated will bring FTX and Binance users over to Robinhood.

     "Just to give my rationale on why I\u2019m so bullish on Amazon.\n\nOn the fundamentals side, Amazon has a market cap of ~1.68T, which is lower than Google\u2019s 1.8T, even though their revenue (390m) and net income (22m) are both higher. On the growth side, Google has most of it\u2019s revenue from ads (147 of the 182b) same as Facebook. Amazon is just getting into building this income stream out! And they have much better data for targeted retail advertising, so the potential is incredibly huge. On top of this, they lead the cloud market, prime video is becoming more popular than netflix, they own Twitch TV (e-sports are getting huge) and they are innovating and entering new sectors like crazy!\n\nIf you consider this, Amazon has a reliable, recession proof (but low margin) stream of income from e-commerce and a huge growth potential in high margin cloud and advertising. And it\u2019s still valued lower than other tech companies today!\n\nOn the technical side, even the cautious wall street price estimates are about $4500, but some go as high as $6000! And I think even that is too cautious. Moreover, there is a clear support line at around $3000, meaning that something horrible would need to happen to have a lower downside than that. So the upside is huge with limited downside.\n\nOn the antitrust issues: Amazon has no monopoly in any single industry. They are large because they have their hands in many things, but if you consider one industry, there is no monopoly, clear as day. And they have a team of lawyers and unlimited money to fight these allegations.\n\nAlso, the end of covid will not affect sales as much as people expect. Not many people who got used to next day delivery will go back to waisting half a Saturday just to get their stuff from a brick and mortar store.\n\nI could keep going on about why the Amazon share price is clearly undervalued today, but I won\u2019t because if you can\u2019t see it yourself I\u2019m not gonna be the on who should convince you."

AMZN Prime members (52%) had an annual membership, up from 49% just three months earlier.\\n\\nFor the first time in four years, the percentage of annual memberships increased in the holiday shopping quarter. In other words, in the December quarter new and renewing members took advantage of the lower annualized cost of a yearly membership, and with that made a longer commitment to Amazon Prime. These new members will be around well into 2021.\\n\\nAccording to a January report, eMarketer estimates global e-commerce sales of $4.28 trillion in 2020, up 27.6% from 2019. Experts expect 14.3% growth in 2021 to $4.89 trillion.\\n\\nThanks for the awards.'",

Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think.\\n\\n20% S&P index fund,\\nXLK - 5%,\\nXLI - 5%,\\nXLP - 20.25%,\\nXLU - 10%,\\nXLB - 2.5%,\\nXLV - 18%,\\nXLC - 5%,\\nXLE - 5.5%,\\n5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM.\\n\\nEssentially were leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.\\n\\nRemaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.\\n\\nEdit: Just so we are all clear, the bottom 23.75% is for us to DCA into A'",

Most of the time, the winner of the last decade are not the winners of the next one, and by removing sectors you are taking away diversification and thus risk. \n\nFor example Financials do better than during high interest rates as they can offer better spreads to their customer (the difference between the fed interest rate and what they offer the customers). In contrast technology does worse, as their ability to generate loses declines. In high interest rate environments, the hurdle rate for investment increases -  so people are less likely to own companies that start to make money in 10 years. \n\nReal Estate protects against inflation better than tech for examples.\n\nBy reducing sector exposure and buying single companies that are in a single correlated sector, you increase your risk.\n\nIf you want to decrease your risk, you would add emerging markets or other developed markets (Europe, Australia, Japan etc) to your portfolio. You can also add bonds for example."

You intend to hold this company until retirement, if thats the case why do people care when the company rallies 8% in a day or something similar in the short term. Do they hope that there wont be a pull back? They wouldnt (in most cases) be able to sell and buy back at a lower price if theyve been holding for a while, so I dont really get it. \\n\\nThanks!'",

Companies that aren\u2019t pulling a profit and rely on massive amounts of debt to grow their business will start being bought out for pennies on the dollar or eventually facing bankruptcy. \n\nOthers will \u201cbe around\u201d but never reach the bubble prices we saw during Covid. \u201cBeing around\u201d is a low bar for an investment. Blackberry gained 500% from 2005-2007. Look at what it did since then. It is \u201cstill around\u201d too. \n\n> These stocks are all down like 80% or more from ATHs and a lot of these stocks are trading well below pre-pandemic levels \n\nQE and low interest rates started way before the pandemic. \n\nThe companies you go on and list are companies that survived those downturns. This is called \u201csurvivorship bias\u201d. If Cathie was investing back then she\u2019d be owning Pets.co, boo.com, and Palm inc.\n\n- I see nothing special or revolutionary about Teledoc. It is Zoom for telehealth appointments. I think anyone who had to do a telehealth consultation during Covid will agree that they are at best annoying, and at worst a total scam. I had to do one and waited a half hour past my time just for the nurse to tell me the problem I was having couldn\u2019t be diagnosed over the phone. They still charged me $60 of course. I also did a handful of these during Covid and none of them were Teledoc. How are they special? I see dozens of competitors. \n\n- Zoom, what is special about them either? Microsoft and Google both have competing products. Why on earth did they ever deserve to be $500/share? \n\n- Roku: Maybe it\u2019s because I tend to buy Samsung, but I haven\u2019t had a tv that used anything Roku related in about a decade. How were they ever worth $400/share when again, they are a company that does nothing disruptive and there are bigger competitors who already do what they do and more? They made sense when smart TVs weren\u2019t as prolific and streaming was just taking off, as you could buy a box for your dumb TV. \n\nThose are just some of the companies you posted that I think make zero sense to me. I actually like Shopify as a concept, as well as block. But it\u2019s all about how things were over-valued."

Companies that are basically nothing but software are always in danger of suddenly becoming obsolete or superceded by someone else over night. There is little in the way of 'brand loyalty' or 'sunken cost for customers'  that can keep such a company alive long enough to restructure and try to regain a foothold in the event.\n\nI also think she's in over her head with her stance on genomics/molecular diagnostics and some of her pharma bets."

They also just developed a process to break down forever chemicals, so that's nice. \n\nDAR- collecting waste and processing it into ingredients. Durable business, but I really like their green diesel business. There's a diesel crunch in America and they have new diesel refinery capacity coming online next year.

     "They have more exposure to fuel prices and labour costs when compared to other big tech companies. They've also just seen very strong cloud and ecommerce numbers from the pandemic so this year comps will likely be harder and we may be seeing some investors rotating out for that reason.\n\nI like AMZN. They have so many great products... Ecommerce, cloud, streaming, etc... I don't really understand why it's struggled so much the last few years. I think investors might be a little worried about what the change in CEO means for AMZN's future. I know people love to hate on Bezos but the dude build AMZN from the ground up and has continuously expanded the business into new areas for years. I worry that same drive for endless grow might not be there anymore, but even if it's not I don't think it's reason to be bearish. If AMZN just continues to dominate in ecommerce and cloud they'll do fine. AAPL underperformed when Tim Cook took over too, it took the market some time to feel sure the company was in good hands. Arguably you could point to MSFT and Ballmer as a reason to be a little cautious when a founder steps down as CEO.\n\nWho knows what's going to happen short-term, but they've got years of strong growth ahead of them with AWS (a product now CEO, Andy Jassy created alongside Bezos) and the stock is currently trading at it's lowest valuation in years. If there is a recession coming they'll be able to weather it and if the economy picks back up later this year the stock should start to recover along with it.\n\nAs a shareholder I'm very comfortable with the price right now. I think the underperformance is just short-term macro-ecommerce concerns as you say."

This is what I've been loading up on lately.\n\nCVRX: they have the only FDA approved device for a particular heart condition. They're just now accelerating their sales which was hampered down by Covid. I have more in this than with GDRX but if it ever gets to all time lows again, I'll load up some more.\n\nAPPS: single tap mobile ads with growing partnerships. Cyclical industry but as cycles go, it'll come back around. Bought a small position hoping to accumulate more.\n\nPATH: I was skeptical about how much they could actually automate for a while but growth has been surprisingly robust. They're having trouble now due to revenue from countries with depreciating currencies and lost business in Russia. Those have nothing to do with the soundness of their business though so I'm looking to buy more on further dips.\n\nSOFI: I was skeptical about this one too for a while but that growth is real. I have a small position but I'll be buying on the dips.\n\nMaybe PLTR if it goes below $7 and bet on them getting more government contracts in the future because of conflicts that won't be resolved any time soon. Bought a ton of CBLT at current prices for a similar reason but with the spike in domestic crimes."

Considering the shift towards electric cars in coming years and the astronomical time and cost it would take to make a network of charging stations on the grid, would take years of digging and zoning, etc. These are a substantially cheaper alternative since they can run totally off grid, and it's a unique product in a growing EV market, with a huge economical upside when considering mass grid overhaul.

     "AI works as follows. Firstly you need a huge amount of data, then you build a model, then you train the model. The model is then deployed and acts like it is intelligent.\n\nThe 'tools' you refer to are usually free. Massive open source tools like tensorflow are commonly used by most AI developers. Cloud providers like amazon can enhance this process by helping you... but even these companies will be using tensorflow etc.\n\nThe data side is the barrier to entry. This is why any large company with lots of data can add value from AI. It is also why small companies and some new companies struggle to make an impact. Google, amazon, Microsoft, crowdstrike etc.\n\nThen you have training the model... and this is where Nvidia comes in. Its graphics cards are essential. They are basically the only player in town. I can't stress how essential their cards are.\n\nFrom the deployment perspective... I think some specific semiconductor companies provide chips (like lattice semiconductor) to help deployment.\n\nSo.. thats why you end up with large cap tech... nvidia, Google, Microsoft, tesla etc."

Is it fixed rate or variable?\n\nSimply saying a business carries a ton of debt means nothing.\n\nBerkshire is in the insurance reinsurance business and they carry a ton of debt, but it's very cheap debt and they earn a return on it.\n\nCharter (now Spectrum) is in the telecommunications business and they carry an astounding amount of debt. But it's almost all fixed cost, and they took it on when rates were much nearer to zero. At this point with interest rate hikes, a lot of the debt they own is, in practice, *paying them*. It's better than free.\n\nI don't know anything particular about Wayfair. Maybe everything you've said is right. But context is important."

     "I for one own 100 shares and just wrote 2 contracts for 85p on April 6. What does this mean? I took advantage or am hoping to take advantage of the pessimism and negative price movement on Amazon. I sold these contracts for $130 credit each, thus I received $260 to leverage 17,000 to Amazon until April 6. This is ~1.5% return on investment should Amazon not be under $85 on April 6.\n\nIf Amazon goes under $85 then on April 6 I will be buying 200 shares for $85. However, if I subtract the $260 credit I got, it\u2019s like I\u2019m getting the shares for $83.70. Why am I doing this risk, I\u2019m already comfortable holding shares here in the low 90s but I\u2019ll gladly take more if it falls to 85. I\u2019ll just decide to take some credit now instead of holding onto my money because I still think it won\u2019t get that low.\n\nAll of this to tell you just hold those 5 shares you have. Sure, it could drop another 7-10 and you may lose another $35-50 but Amazon is a longer term play. I\u2019d look at it as a solid play in an account which may average around 5-10% per year gain but you could make some extra if you\u2019re savvy writing options if you have enough $"

     "I was early on AMZN stock.  As in back before anyone had it or thought it would be viable.  Also had business relationship that meant direct contact with Bezos staff.  Lots of product to and from.  Told many people of it.  \n\nWell, I saw standards slipping a decade ago and gradually scaled completely away probably 5-6 years ago.  In recent years, customers are noticing the cracks and problems.  It's now an ad-laden, unusable flea market for counterfeit and offshore suppliers.  Delivery and customer service standards have imploded.  \n\nIt's been forever since I heard a consumer-based positive, and it seems there's just one negative story after another.  I think pandemic spared and slowed their decline, but they're back on that same trajectory\n\nPeople used to check out products locally and then order from Amazon.  That has almost flipped.  Businesses used to fear Amazon announcing a move into their space.  Now, they almost welcome it, because they'll be able to show how they're doing it better than bad big Amazon.  \n\nAll of that said, the counter case is that most of the big bombed out stocks that have had huge rallies in the last year have had similar horrible narratives and sick prognoses.  So maybe AMZN will copy what's happened with NVDA, TSLA, META, CRM, NFLX.  All of those were considered walking dead, and frankly none of them has actually made any kind of significant change or announcement to deserve their 60 to 100+% rebounds.  \n\nThese names and others just had to string two or even one tempting tale and the bulls took it from there.  \n\nNetflix \"customers hate us but now we're going to sell ads and don't look too closely at our plans because we have none and oops we had to refund the advertisers and next our plan to to bug our customers and call them thieves\"\n\nTesla - our pathological owner maybe be getting more pascistic by the day, but he now says he's going to stop dumping stock (maybe) and we're slashing prices because we're the only car company somehow building up inventory right now.\"\n\nNvidia - we can't gouge on the price of our videogame chips by calling them crypppt products anymore, so now we'll call them AI chips.\n\nMeta - we'll stop talking about our silly avatar world vision so much, and we'll fire a bunch of the people who had nothing to do with it.  \n\nAnd so on.  \n\nSo all AMZN really needs to do is say one or two things the market wants to hear.  They don't even have to be necessarily great or even true.  Announce big layoffs or say they're cutting back on lord of the rings spending, maybe announce a new CEO that's not like an NPC.  Say they're turning delivery logistics over to AI.  Or possibly the biggest thing, say they're segmenting the Chinese/counterfeit goods off to a separate website and \"consulting\" with Bezos to bring the web store back to something more trustworthy and customer friendly.  The stock wouldn't even wait for them to actually do these things.  Just the whiff of them maybe happening would spark it up.  Even just someone there admitting they've lost their their way and that the pizza tastes like cardboard, that alone could revive the stock."

The stock almost doubled after March 2020 due to higher expectations for e-commerce. \\n\\nHowever, Amazon hasn't really managed to turn that extra revenue into profit. Quite the opposite. They've continuously had worse and worse cash flows as they had to invest a lot of money in fulfillment. Now e-commerce is slowing down and they have all these extra resources/workers that have to work their way through the Amazon system. It seems like maybe profitability is going to be even more unpredictable in their retail section. So compared to pre-covid, their retail operations seem a bit less predictable and profitable. \\n\\nPlus, this is anecdotal, but I feel like I've been hearing more and more complaints about Amazon. Delivery times were really long during Covid, and there are more and more advertisements and knockoff goods pushed to the top of the page. Seems\"",

     "I wonder how easy it is to set up a new warehouse. Not just for Amazon, in general. Warehouses in this area of Alabama seem to have entry wages start much lower than Amazon, even unionized warehouses. However they also seem more selective at a glance. Amazon seems to recruit more from other fields. Retail, recent high school graduates, and so on. Their point of comparisons and expectations might be different from the usual warehouse industry of their locality and thus have different expectations in multiple ways, or desire for reform. Though I've heard Amazon also expects harder work for a higher salary. Not sure if that's true or not, other people who work at warehouses sometimes claim Amazon's no different from the average warehouse, but maybe they came from the lower end warehouses.\n\nIt's hard to balance limited resources and expected motivation. Motivation is especially tricky. Some people want to be motivated, focused and driven. But wanting it and actually being it to a mild or even high degree is different.\n\nI think unions offer benefits, but also potential risks. Best case it helps the worker and potentially the business, higher salary, easier work, better hours, and maybe more efficient work.  Worst case its another layer of bureaucracy, and the union heads like any leadership position has risk of abuse of power, corruption, nepotism, etc. Some unions charge heavy fees or dues to work any job or even hold a title in the industry, and the bad ones might not give a tangible benefit for those monetary costs and physical restrictions on individual freedom to choose jobs/work. Plus promotion paths. Some dislike promotion paths weighing more on years worked, instead of quality of work. Someone with 20 years experience doing poor work gets more promotions and higher pay/control/leadership posts than someone with 5 years experience who works hard in some systems. That's worst case for it."
