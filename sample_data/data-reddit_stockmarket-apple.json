     "What a meme.\n\nA lot of people in this thread are forgetting that they might not be the target audience. \"It's too expensive for me\". Okay. It's not too expensive for any of the companies I'm working with and they're frothing at the bit to get their hands on a bunch. It'll change the way they'll demo their products. It'll change the way they'll design the layouts of their systems inside of buildings. They tried it with the hololens and that kinda worked, but this is so much better already.\n\nPeople here seem to forget that Apple didn't use to focus on the consumer market at all, that kinda came when Jobs introduced the iPod. Before that, Apple was known for making expensive but quality business hardware and software with consumer products being less of a priority for most generations. And they kinda never really stopped. The Mac Pro is not meant for regular consumers (although I'm sure some got one). Let alone things like the Pro Display XDR that was memed on heavily for being an expensive display, but is considered by professionals one of the best displays in the field for its purpose and price.\n\nIt's a useful skill to realize that if you're not the target audience for something, that doesn't mean there is none."

To get a shiny new iPhone you need easy access to credit or lots of money. China had a huge problem making their iphones in China when the U.S. is not\n\n exactly on the best of terms politically.  At best here comes a temporary pump and dump. They fire employees revenues temporary increase and stock goes up temporarily and then stock falls back down to a real price.\n\nI hate layoffs it almost means that it is a temporary solution and at best they can just fire people and then ask for more loans from banks  or more credit from creditors who supply material etc. \n\nThey didn't improve the company they just shuffled money around."

Just not selling enough macs or ipads is not a huge red flag. But this will force them to launch the next big thing(MR headset) before its mature for sure. I am expect tepid reactions though Apple is playing the long game  here in getting software ecosystem getting built for future releases. \n\nThat said beyond all the above I see flight to safety for companies which have huge moat.

Big faang stocks are keeping the broad market from dropping another 20% and as soon as those stocks dump again on bad numbers(assuming this even happens) the market will dump again. \n\nAt this point my guess is we have a soft landing in the economy and the stock market has already bottomed or is close to it and we will more or less consolidate for a while until economic indicators get better.\n\nOrrrrrr\n\nWe keep raising interest rates blindly until we see the whites of inflations eyes and then theres some sort of unforeseen event(possible credit driven) that tanks the US economy and takes the big faang stocks with it:)\n\nEdit: obviously there\u2019s a million different ways this could play out but it seems like there\u2019s really only a few ways this is likely to go.

     "I\u2019m not sure how familiar you are with tech and large software companies but all the big tech companies have had AI for years in all sorts of places that you may or may not noticed or seen. Microsoft made a bet on a smaller company which created a way for normal people to engage directly with their latest and greatest AI and packaged it up real nice. People are excited about this, but I don\u2019t think it fundamentally changes the direction of these businesses. Rather than trying to make something up or rush something out, I think Apple has correctly calculated that while AI is on the top of everyone\u2019s mind, they do not need to change the course of their business or rush some product to market just because it\u2019s hot. It sort of reminds me of blockchain or metaverse from the last few years. The difference is that AI already exists and is being put to use all around us in a lot of ways that you probably just never directly interacted with the way that you can with ChatGPT. \n\nThat said, as long as there is consumer appetite and money to be made then I\u2019m sure you will see some kind of interactive AI start to be incorporated more and more into some of the software you already use. \n\nSo to answer your question, they\u2019re probably just as far along as everyone else, but you just don\u2019t directly interact with and at this point it doesn\u2019t seem like Apple is going to change their business plans to create something new just because it is the new hot thing."

Their hardware is shitty as it gets, but their software is made to use 100% of those shitty hardware resources and be less vulnerable as possible.

This is a thing the play store doesnt have.

  "Text": "b'Apple is cutting Tim Cooks compensation by over 40% to $49 million in 2023. This $49 million pay consists of $3 million base salary, $6 million bonus, and $40 million stock awards. Within that $40 million stock awards, $30 million will be dependent on AAPL share performance. If AAPL share hits performance thresholds, the $30 million will be doubled to at least $60 million. Therefore, in the best scenario, Cook could get over $79 million pay in 2023.\\n\\nDespite the poor performance of AAPL, the compensation Cook received in 2022 was $99.4 million which includes $3 million base salary and over $83 million stock awards and bonus. The pay in 2022 was higher than the $98.7 million pay in 2021.\\n\\nComparing with other executives, Cooks compensation is way higher. CFO Luca Maestri, General Counsel Kate Adams, retail chief Deidre OBrien and COO Jeff Williams are all paid about $27 million total in 2022.\\n\\nThis is incredible, why Cook could get such a high pay even after AAPL sucked for the whole'",

     "Honestly, at this point, I feel like they missed their chance and that type of tech is no longer necessary and wouldn\u2019t be the number one choice for me anyway (I\u2019m a T1D). I guess the one advantage it has is that users wouldn\u2019t need to keep paying for sensors or would require insurance or prescriptions which I guess would be good for folks that are borderline diabetic or just want to monitor their blood glucose out of caution but don\u2019t medically need to and so don\u2019t want to be forking out extra money.\n\nI wear a Libre 3 sensor. It\u2019s the size of a nickel and barely noticeable on my upper arm. It\u2019s on me 24/7 (for 2 weeks before needing to be replaced). Doesn\u2019t need to be charged in those two weeks and is continuously sending information to my phone (and i think it can also send the info to your smartwatch). My phone rings if my sugar is too high or too low (which is great for diabetics scared of not waking up by themselves during a hypoglycaemic event in the middle of the night). The \u201cinvasiveness\u201d of it needing to a have a little wire in my skin is not even noticeable (apart from a little pinch that lasts 10 seconds upon application). Of course if it could be even smaller, that would always be nicer but I really can\u2019t complain.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to rely on an Apple Watch for my glucose monitoring. An Apple Watch needs to be charged regularly. It\u2019s way bulkier than the sensor on my arm. I\u2019d have to wear it all the time (playing sports or sleeping or when showering) to get to the same level of monitoring coverage."

Now Apple still sees it as one of the companys most critical projects. Apple spent about $26 billion on research and development in fiscal 2022 and devoted several billion dollars so far to the effort. The company operates a 62,000-square-foot facility in Santa Clara, California to conduct test manufacturing of the screens.\\n\\nAlthough the determination is real, this 2024 target could potentially slip until 2025, some people involved in the project said. But the company also could just offer a limited supply of the new devices to get the transition started. In near term, Apple Watch could be the first product to install the new displays.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gn'",

There must be some reasons for Apple to team up with Globalstar and it looks like that it's a long lasting partnership (e.g. new satellites scheduled for 2025).                  \\nSo why Apple didn't acquired Globalstar in the first place, it would have been a good deal (in 2020 Gsat had a marketcap of about 400-500 Mio $) or do you think that Apple wants to keep it that way?\\n\\n\\nApple has already spend tons of millions into Globalstar - around 600 Million $. What are your guesses about Apples plans? Apple Link (data package) for iPhone 16?\\n\\nIm curious about your thoughts!\"",

As a world traveler, I\u2019d love nothing more than having one company handle all my wireless needs. It starts with emergencies and short connectivity until a network of low orbiting satellites with high speeds can be built out. That would be the dream."

     "Chapter 8: The Investor and Market Fluctuations\r  \n\r  \nIn this chapter, Graham discusses the importance of staying calm and rational in the face of market fluctuations. He argues that investors should focus on the long-term and not be swayed by short-term market movements. He also introduces the concept of \"Mr. Market,\" who represents the market's irrational behavior. Graham advises investors to treat Mr. Market like a manic-depressive uncle, and to only buy stocks when he is offering them at a bargain price.\r  \n\r  \nChapter 20: The Defensive Investor and the Speculator\r  \n\r  \nIn this chapter, Graham discusses the difference between an investor and a speculator. He defines an investor as someone who buys a stock because they believe it is a good value, and a speculator as someone who buys a stock because they believe the price will go up. Graham argues that investors should focus on buying stocks that are undervalued, and that speculators should only speculate with money they can afford to lose."

This is worrisome because apple had already announced they would be seeing some delays. This way about 3 weeks ago. So now we\u2019re seeing more issues in capacity over at Foxconn right around the holidays.\n\nKeep in mind Apple is a large weight in ETF like QQQ and SPY\n\nQQQ: 12.51%\n\nSPY: 7.07%\n\nNow to make this entire covid situation worse, we have these protest in xinjiang after a deadly fire in an apartment building killed 10 people. To elaborate on this, firefighters took longer to arrive to the scene because of covid 19 barricades and parked electric vehicles in narrow pathways that had lost power.\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the crayon drawing.\n\nSupport: 138ish\n\nResistance: 150ish\n\n50 day moving average: 146.53\n\n200 day moving average: 154.60\n\nDemand zone (green box): 127 to around 138, this is where you see people buying\n\nSupply zone(red box) : around 158 to 150, this is where you see people selling\n\nRight now, we\u2019re sandwiched between the 50 day and the 200 day and if we lose the 50 day, we risk hitting the bottom support trend line. The first chart is showing a 10-year 1 day time frame.\n\nThe top and bottom trendlines \u201cthicker red crayon lines\u201d create a pennant. On the second chart, I show a shorter time frame. 30-day 30-minute time frame. You can see the rejections off the top trend line a little clearer. We had 3 rejections more recently. Also if we fall out of the pennant, we risk closing the gap we made a few days ago."

A COVID outbreak at the facility has lead to a mass evacuation of personnel.  Video has appeared online for several days showing thousands of Foxconn workers walking along highways to return to their home towns.  They are not allowed on buses or trains because they are designated as \"close contacts\" under China's strict anti-pandemic health code system.  It is the largest industrial plant shut down in human history.  The impact on Apple will be enormous, but the financial news media does not seem to realize it yet."

Who else remembers went the hand controllers showed up and all the people went on with the hand gesture humour. Facial expressions are the next level! Maybe I'm seeing it wrong and people are a bunch of uncharismatic NPCs and and rather be expressionless avatars that spam air emojis or whatever emojis become rather than having IRL expressions crossover to the \"metaverse\". But for me, it is the next level, the death of the emojis, a revolution in online chatting.\n\nI was watching LTT video and when he said \"Oh right, there is facial tracking, I probably shouldn't be making this face.\" that was when I realised the revolution inbound.\n\nI understand they have spent more money than NASA spent to send men to the moon. \n\n(disclaimer, I had no share in META prior to earnings, I'm not holding bags)"

As for Microsoft now I\u2019m interested hmmmm\u2026 as long they can keep up with the selling momentum of their products and services..

Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. \n\nIn comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That\u2019s per company. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a company that can produce at Tesla\u2019s speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it\u2019s going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That\u2019s 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that\u2019s a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. \n\nI know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. \n\nTesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years.

     "It doesn't seem like mutch. I have to wonder how the tresury auctions next week will affect behavior going forward. It seems like the FEDs new window prevents rug pull withdrawal. I still haven't heard anything on the closed door meetings, and we started the weekend with crazy bear stories from nukes in Belarus (Zerohedge sucks) to the dominos hitting DB and maybe C Schwab (TDAmeritrade). All this after a seller exhaustion induced rip to recovery over the course of Friday. \n\nThis is maybe strange, but I'm going to have confidence in the market if we break down to spy386 over the first half of next week with tresuries losing a quarter. However, we could rip sooner if the fed announces cheap financing to the government to cover the cost of fallout that has taken place. However, if they announce something like that early, that rip will pull money out of treasuries and possibly exacerbate the situation.\n\nSo I suppose I will position myself for what I think will be wise choices by our leaders while preparing myself to be wrong and quick to acknowledge it.

     "Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share.\n\nHowever, Apple came up short versus revenue expectations in core product categories including the company\u2019s iPhone business and services.\n\nApple shares fell over 4% at one point in extended trading before recovering.\n\nHere is how Apple did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates:\n\n* EPS $1.29 vs. $1.27 est.\n* Revenue. $90.15 billion vs. $88.90 billion estimated, up 8.1% year-over-year\n* iPhone revenue: $42.63 billion vs. $43.21 billion estimated, up 9.67% year-over-year\n* Mac revenue: $11.51 billion vs. $9.36 billion estimated, up 25.39% year-over-year\n* iPad revenue: $7.17 billion vs. $7.94 billion estimated, down 13.06% year-over-year\n* Other Products revenue: $9.65 billion vs. $9.17 billion estimated, up 9.85% year-over-year\n* Services revenue: $19.19 billion vs. $20.10 billion estimated, up 4.98% year-over-year\n* Gross margin: 42.3% vs. 42.1% estimated\n\nApple did not provide official guidance for its first fiscal quarter, which ends in December and contains Apple\u2019s biggest sales season of the year. It hasn\u2019t provided guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty.\n\nApple increased revenue by 8% during the quarter, and Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that it would\u2019ve grown \u201cdouble-digits\u201d if not for the strong dollar. Total sales in Apple\u2019s fiscal 2022 were up 8% to $394.3 billion.\n\n\u201cThe foreign exchange headwinds were over 600 basis points for the quarter,\u201d Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach. \u201cSo it was significant. We would have grown in double digits without the foreign exchange headwinds.\u201d\n\nCook told CNBC that Apple had slowed the pace of its hiring. Other tech companies are looking to make cuts ahead of a possible recession and as interest rates rise.\n\n\u201cWe are hiring deliberately. And so we we\u2019ve slowed the pace of hiring,\u201d Cook said.\n\nAlthough Apple\u2019s iPhone business increased sales by over 9% on an annual basis, it came up short versus analyst expectations. Apple\u2019s September quarter had 8 days of iPhone 14 sales, and analysts are closely looking for details about if Apple customers are trading up for more expensive models or if the new devices are poised to sustain higher sales through Apple\u2019s fiscal 2023.\n\nCook indicated that Apple\u2019s performance in phone sales was strong despite signs that other smartphone companies are struggling with a recent decrease in demand and said the company grew \u201cswitchers,\u201d or people who bought an Apple phone after having an Android device. He added that the company\u2019s high-end phones, the iPhone 14 Pro, were supply constrained.\n\n\u201cWe clearly countered the industry trends on the on the phone if you look at third party estimates of what the smartphone industry did,\u201d Cook said.\n\nApple\u2019s services business also missed estimates.\n\nApple\u2019s services business reported just under 5% growth during the quarter, a significant slowdown for the investor-favorite and profitable business line versus last quarter, which was 12%.\n\nFor the fiscal year, Apple services grew just over 14% to $78.13 billion, a slower rate of growth than 2021\u2032s 16% annual increase, and much slower than 2020\u2032s 27% services growth.\n\nThe business includes several different lines, including Apple\u2019s online services like Apple Music and Apple TV+, revenue from the App Store, hardware warranties, and search deals with companies like Google.\n\nApple recently increased prices for Apple Music and Apple TV+, but the increases started during the December quarter.\n\nCook said the price increases were \u201cdisconnected\u201d from Apple\u2019s services performance.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re in the if you look at the price increases as an example, music, the licensing cost has increased,\u201d Cook said.\n\nHe added that Apple TV+ has more shows now, so Apple feels that the product is more valuable.\n\nInvestors generally like Apple\u2019s move into services because the products are more profitable than Apple\u2019s hardware and often bring in recurring revenue.\n\nThere were a few bright spots in Apple\u2019s report. Mac sales were up over 25% to $11.51 billion, even as data points from parts suppliers, chipmakers, and competing PC firms were pointing during the quarter to a significant slowdown in laptop and desktop sales after two boom years during the pandemic.\n\nApple\u2019s Other Products category, which includes Apple Watch and AirPods, also saw an annual increase and beat Wall Street expectations. Some analysts believed that Apple\u2019s wearables were most likely to be hurt if recessionary fears slowed discretionary spending. That business increased nearly 10% year-over-year to $9.65 billion.\n\nApple\u2019s iPad, which had been hampered by supply issues, decreased nearly 10% year-over-year and is Apple\u2019s smallest individual line of business. The company recently released new models in October, which could boost sales just after the September quarter finished. Cook said that it was a difficult comparison because last year, Apple released new iPads in September."

     "Search is not that one dimensional.     There are cases you really want Google search as you are doing something that is more transactional.\n\nSo for example I need to find a flight from the US to BKK (Bangkok).  I go to Google and type it in and it gives me some fares.  Or I need to book a hotel.\n\nBut then there are times I really want to dig into something and a large language model makes a lot more sense.\n\nSo for example I was watching a movie and really wanted to know where I specific scene was filmed.    Doing this with a regular search engine is just not optimal.\n\nI started with just regular Google and then decided to bring up Bard instead.  That worked so much better and I was able to find the location.\n\nI did then use the answer in a Google search to verify it was not made up.   But with the answer it is very easy to do that.\n\nThe ideal search engine is a combination of regular Google search with Bard also available at the same time.\n\nGoogle has over 96% mobile search market share and that is not going to go away quickly.   So Google has plenty of time to integrate the two.\n\nhttps://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/worldwide\n\nOne huge advantage for Google is the TPUs.  Large language models take a ton more resources than traditional search.  This article is dated but so much more true today.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/\n\nThis was the original TPUs.  Google has the fourth generation in production and working on the fifth generation.  They came out with this paper recently and it is pretty good.   Basically Google found a way to save a lot of electricity by not converting back and forth from optical.  Instead switch as optical using mirrors.\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433"

  "Text": "b'Apple shares are at great risk of a major pullback in case the economic slowdown proves to be greater-than-expected, Goldman Sachs analysts told clients.\\n\\nAnalyst Rod Hall sees a downside risk of 42% for Apple shares if the bear-case scenario is materialized.\\n\\nHis new base-case scenario has Apple shares trading at $130.00 per share, which is a new price target (down from the prior $157.00). The lowered price target reflects decreased revenue forecasts by \\\\~2% in both FY23 and FY24.\\n\\nIn our Base case forecast for Apple, we model a revenue CAGR of 10% from CY19A - CY23E which we note is an acceleration from the 3% growth the company delivered between CY15A - CY19A. We model the companys EBIT margin and EPS to expand to 28.1% and $5.81 respectively in CY23 from 24.7% and $3.17 in CY19 Our Bear case revenue and EPS estimates imply the potential for 22% and 33% downside risk vs. consensus, respectively, Hall wrote.\\n\\nRead the full article: [https://ph.investing.com/news/stock-mark'",

As a result, the company's shares gapped up on Thursday's open to the tune of 15%. It was both a remarkable result and a remarkable response, which bodes well for the tech company as a whole.\\n\\nHow both Google and Apple had done just enough to keep the tech industry buoyant with their earnings beats, but this from Meta is a whole other story.

It's a similar gap to what they experienced at the end of Jan, and it could be looking at the start of another fresh multi-month rally.\\n\\n## Smashing Expectations\\n\\nDigging into the numbers, the company's GAAP EPS came in at $2.20, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.97. Meanwhile, the company's revenue of $28.6 billion also beat expectations and showed growth\"",

Google is going to start doing what Apple started a few years ago and would expect similar results.\n\nGoogle market cap is about $1.4 trillion and $70 billion buyback is 5%.   Will not get a full 5% in reduced shares.  But should get close to 4%.   Then this will happen year after year and compound.  But with Google you will get a faster growth rate.

     "Actually the Santa rally is when everyone goes away for the holiday and the only ones left are the small traders and die hards without families. Similar to Thanksgiving. Last Thanksgiving showed what home traders can do online as well as the first few days in January. There isn\u2019t any such thing as a Santa rally although two days before Xmas and the days afterwards will be very interesting. I\u2019ve also noticed there isn\u2019t a tax selling abundance unless it happened after the Fed meeting. Either way with the flip of a switch anyone can get online and see what the markets are doing and make a trade. I believe that the psychology of the markets controls todays up or down movements. That also means that the markets are not usually right these days since most people still have the \u201cbuy the dips\u201d mentality."

  "Text": "b' Last week, big U.S. tech companies began reporting their earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The results were generally ahead of estimates; for example, Alphabet revealed that its revenue grew, and that its rate of decline in earnings slowed down. Meta Platforms and others also put out earnings that were well ahead of expectations.\\n\\nThe results seen from U.S. tech companies last week call into question the narrative that we are in the midst of an earnings recession. This year, analysts have been busy cutting corporate earnings estimates because of a belief that earnings will decline due to a poor economy. The actual results posted suggest otherwise. Most of the U.S. tech companies are posting positive revenue growth; a few are even growing their earnings.\\n\\n## Microsoft beats earnings\\n\\n**Microsoft ($MSFT)** was a big winner in last weeks U.S. earnings bonanza. It not only beat expectations but also delivered positive growth in net income, which most of its peers were not able to'",

     "I wouldn't put a dollar in to AMD given its absurd valuation but there's an interresting road ahead.\n\nIt looks like Intel will need to hold back on dividends going forward but they didnt say so yet(?).  That's what I believe given how much they are spending on new foundries and R&D. When it comes to competing with AMD, they will probably not catch up until H2 next year if they release their new generations in time.\n\nWhat to look forward to, will they release next gen chips in time? Granite rapid being the most important since it is the one that is supposed to catch up with AMD. If they succeed with that and keeps releasing according to plan their coming Diamond rapids follows, this has basically only been rumored and leaked, but it would, if it releases in time get ahead of AMD (according to rumors).\n\nIn essence its a turn around case, if it works it works. Otherwise they could just adopt the businessmodel of TSMC. Let others produce their chips in their foundries.\n\nIf anyone will make this happen it is their current CEO, but they can't screw up on timelines anymore, that'll bury them. \n\nThere might be errors in my analysis, I'm open to discussions"

That would put AAPL's market cap at, what, 1.2 Trillion? They spend nearly $100 billion per year on buybacks, and growing. They'd buy back the entire company if it ever got that low again. AAPL is my one holding that I actually get excited for dips, because it means Luca can buy back more. The only way AAPL will ever get that low is if 1) China geopolitical issues/war 2) Antitrust wipes their service revenue off the face of the earth."

     "If you are building a solid diversified portfolio in equities only, you should own some income stocks as well. Their dividends give you exposure to payments similar to holding a bond that pays a coupon payment on certain dates until maturity. An income stock does not have the direct current market value if you need to sell in reverse (negative correlation) to interest rate movements/levels.\n\nThe 60/40  equity/bond build is back in favor since the QE mania from The Fed has ended which only goosed up the equity returns over the past 13 years. A 2-year treasury bond gives you a 4.8% yield right now until maturity, with zero risk.\n\nThe Rule of thumb is the older you get, and having less working/income earnings years left until retirement, the heavier you weigh on the bond side. Bonds have much less risk, especially Treasuries.\n\nOne portfolio I built had tech (MSFT - small dividend), banks (JP morgan - smal dividend), retail (DLTR - retail), defense (LMT - small dividend), energy (XOM - 8% dividend) and consumer products (MO - 8% dividend) in the mix. Built that one in the fall of 2020 and has worked quite well. (those 8%s were at time of buying. XOMs is lower now).\n\nWell diversified. Your portfolio gets an income payment every quarter from dividends with which you can use to reinvest and buy a few more shares of the stock. Some stocks went up, some went down. Overall, the SP500 is down, and that portfolio is up.\n\nHere is one of the better links I found on sector rotation.\n\n[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market\\_analysis:sector\\_rotation\\_analysis](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:sector_rotation_analysis)\n\nNotice the 6 stocks I put in that portfolio fall in different sectors on the rotation map, which further diversifies your portfolio and also against market fluctuations. To size balance to start, you can use $s into each stock and not the nominal stock prices.\n\nThat portfolio got a little lucky as I picked DLTR in the fall of 2020 after the March covid blip down and then popped back up as I expected coming inflation with The Fed buying over $4T in bonds. Then, after Joe won, I figured DC spending was going to ramp up. It did not hurt that the war propped up LMT and energy prices as well.\n\nBest of luck.\n\ngoing forward long term, I really like cyber security stocks."

Worst case I could see someone like Gates taking it private and expand to countries which are desperately short of food."

     "There are some interesting and valuable ideas here; I encourage you to keep thinking about and developing these ideas. However, I think there may be some fundamental flaws in your thinking that are leading to erroneous conclusions.\n\nThe core of the problem is that your writing seems to assume that governments are dependent on currency holders voluntarily agreeing to buy debt. But this is not really the case for many countries - specifically, for sovereign currency issuers, which as it happens, includes most of the major advanced nations, who are the ones mostly responsible for wars. So you have the least leverage over those whose behaviors you most need to change.\n\nYou might think that a government wishing to spend more than it collects in taxes, and thus must borrow, is at the whims of the its creditors. But it's not really the case. You'll forgive me for using America as an example, as it is the monetary system whose mechanics I am most familiar with, but the end result is the same for all sovereign currency issuers.\n\nWhen the United States Treasury issues debt, it does so at auction. Participating in this auction are the \"primary dealers\" - major domestic and foreign banks. I don't see the primary dealers curbing the government's wars, for two reasons. First, they are literally required by law to participate in Treasury auctions. Putting conditions on the purchase of treasuries would be flatly illegal, and it would mean those primary dealers lose their coveted position of privilege within the financial infrastructure.\n\nBut frankly the problem is even deeper than that. I mean why does the US wage wars in the first place? Why does it overthrow democratically elected leaders to install authoritarian dictators? To put it simply, because it is in the interests of American multinational companies. Banks have no incentive to stop the American government from going to war. Quite the opposite. They profit from war. Obviously they make money financing the military industrial complex - but there are also tremendous opportunities to make money when foreign countries are opened up for investment. Such trade liberalization has been a key pillar of US foreign policy since WWII, and it has often happened at the barrel of a gun - just like the Brits and their \"gunboat diplomacy\" when it was their turn to be the world economic hegemons.\n\nJust to play the idea out though, what might happen if all the primary dealers suddenly and unanimously decided to stop buying debt? What would the government's options be? It could raise taxes to make up the difference. It could instruct the Treasury to buy government debt directly, rather than purchasing it in the open market. Or perhaps the Fed would simply let the treasury overdraft permanently.\n\nThere are other possible technical solutions, like the issuing of a trillion dollar platinum coin. But the point is, at the end of the day, the money is a tool of the government. The legal authority to issue money comes from the Constitution, and is vested in Congress, who has outsourced it to the Fed. Congress can self-impose some constraints - it can write a budget to say exactly how much money can be spent on what, and it can set a limit on how much debt it can issue. But if it decides that it wants to spend or issue debt, there is really no entity that can stop it - at least under the current rules of the game. It would take a dramatic legal sea change, a foreign invasion, or some other extreme and radical event for Congress to wind up in a place where it couldn't spend or borrow exactly as much as it wishes. This is broadly true for any sovereign currency issuing government, which includes the uk, canada, australia, china, Japan, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and others."

He turned his $184K invested into $1.6M \u2192 an annualized return of 9%. The simple secret behind Bob\u2019s success is that he never sold his investments.

The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, lets understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be too high. For example, in [Tesla](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=TSLA) 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.\\n\\nA stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split.

Tech titan Apple stock is closing in on its latest buy point, as it heads for a six-week win streak. \\n\\nOn Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average trimmed a 1% gain to just 0.1%, while the S&P 500 reversed slightly lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended down 0.6%, after an early 1.3% rally found stout resistance around the 13,000 level. The Nasdaq remains higher for the week, and on track for a four-week win streak.'",

Powell said higher for longer. It takes 6-12 months for any rate hike to have an effect so that it should start to have an effect in the 4th quarter and thereafter. He will keep rates at a high level for longer. There is no need to raise 100 BPS at the next meeting. Also, QT at the higher, final level starts 9/15. Younger people who invest and those on Wall Street are often inexperienced and over-react to things. I lived in the 70\u2019s with gas lines, stagflation, and VERY high rates. We need to expect what Powell said, increase economic growth, and increase productivity. Immigration reform at the high level and lower levels would reduce inflation as well."

The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?\\n\\n# Operations\\n\\nFirst of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.\\n\\n* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts\\n* 16% increase in number of tran\"",

And another part of the death sentence Ebay appear to have judged themselves as worthy... Sounds like they use the same PR firm as Nike and Bud!\n\nHowever, to many folk, Paypal and Ebay are synonymous and there shall be a perception of severe harm to Paypal which bothers me."

Because in 2010 Google decided to mass ban \u201clow quality \u201c advertisers. And yes, that meant even if you spent millions like I did. \n\nThey wanted Fortune 500 brand dollars. And they got it. \n\nSo we all moved to FB to advertise. 10 years later. The same thing. Banned. \n\nIn 10 years, TikTok will do the same. \n\nIt\u2019s a cycle that monopolies exploit before they reach that stage. \n\nSo, yes. Google is most definitely a search advertising monopoly like FB is a paid social advertising monopoly. \n\nTikTok might help make FB\u2019s case they aren\u2019t a monopoly in paid social, but that\u2019s just smoke and mirrors. Those platforms are VERY different. You could actually pit YouTube against TikTok for a better comparison. \n\nSpeaking of which, YouTube starts to bolster the case for Google being a monopoly of advertising networks. \n\nDid you know the 2 largest traffic sources in the world are owned by Google? That\u2019s a problem."

     "You think we can have bull run with no QE and highest rates in 15 years? With most people barely able to afford to keep up with cost of living increase and energy prices likely driving inflation further? \n\nNone of this is possible. The bull run of the past 20 years was created with low rates and free $. We now pay the consequences. There is NO WAY to stop inflation without deep recession as we have to destroy labor market to stop wage inflation. Recession should last through 2024 (just like in Europe ). Housing, coins, all stocks which don\u2019t make $ should crash as people with no jobs will be forced to liquidate. The fed will eventually cut rates due to recession but it\u2019s too late. 2025 we start over and rebuild. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we hit bottom sometime end of next year at around s and p 2700, which would be in line with other bear markets."

     "In response to the first picture, it\u2019s going to take something strange or significant occurring for the S&P to trade 4600 in the next 12-13 months honestly. The closest we got to it making sense was in August where it looked like rates were going to wind up back in the multi-decade downtrend, then the massive jawboning by the Fed started, which caused some major whiplash there (I didn\u2019t expect 4600 to come in a straight line at that point, but in the remote world where it did occur it\u2019d have been near the end of the year or early next).\n\nThe best case is likely 4300 unless the long-end winds up back under 3 and I feel like there\u2019s essentially a 0% chance of this occurring without some bad crap going down, and if the bad crap takes it under, the S&P is not trading 4600 in that scenario.\n\nIf October was it for a few months, I think 4100 can trade again before EoY, but it\u2019s just as likely that October was just like July and the S&P ends up at 3400 or something on December 31st. In a world where we\u2019re at 4100 or at the very least, 3490ish sticks as the low for 2022, I think Q1 next year marks the low.\n\nBut if 3490ish doesn\u2019t stick, the odds of a secular bear get pretty high, so all of the averages double bottom with their COVID lows in the first half of 2023."

     "I actually just went long this last week on the Q's/beat up tech because I believe something similar. I just .don't think the market can crash right now (without a black swan event) because we just have too much liquidity... I also think that rates have topped for the rest of the year before they move higher in '23. Then I believe the Dollar is about to cool off as well and all of this will allow tech room to rally and breath, before it's clear that the recession is actually here and earnings are negative. So I think somewhere in between Q1/Q2 of '23 is when the market actually bottoms. \n\nAs a side note: Markets usually make new highs after yield curve inversions but before the recession hits... So I could see this playing out similarly where we go on a crazy strong rally into EOY... I just don't see new highs... but perhaps the Dow could make a new high, while SPY and Q's underperform... just like what we have seen recently"

     "Great research! Provides some nice  insights onthe current market. \n\nFrom Powell's transcript,  there are still billions of spending awaiting to be injected into the economy. ( Chips act, bipartisan , ) Powell been slow playing the game, easing investors into high rate environment.  Inflation is around 6.6% in September.(this is excluding food and energy data as well, otherwise would be higher) Even if Powell increase rate by 75 basis pts in december, fed rate is still much much too low. \nPowell emphasized again on how firm they are in maintaining 2% inflation. The expectation of rate increase during this round was 4.4% next year, now after this latest update, market is expecting 5+ %. \n\nNotice how they are slowly raising the expectation? \n\nHow does this impact our economy? Aside from what op said about liquid and dealers holding the bag.... All sorts of debts we are seeing.  30 year housing rate is at 7% right now  (highest since 2002) and mortgage application have crashed to the bottom.(lowest since 1997)  This directly translates to housing crisis in the making. (Those who does Airbnb arbitrage will probably suffer the most.). Moreover, the housing sales so far ONLY dropped by 25% comparing to last year.  (This is not even shown on the government's inflation data.) \n\nPowell have been dodging all the serious questions about these impact not being captured on the CPI/PCE data. The housing data they have collects only rent and etc.... Doesn't even touch the housing price. (Supporting data is from Bureau of labor statistics using their shelter index to measure the cost of housing for both renters and the homeowners. \"Focuses on the rent tenant pays and how much the rent equivalent would be if home owner rented a party similar to their own.\"  This is ridiculous method as it would experience huge delay and cannot capture the REAL housing data in real time. .....to put it into perspective, if housing price crashes but not to the point it impacts the rental price, their data will not even acknowledge of the housing crash. \n\nPowell is not done yet. All these cover ups or purposely NOT mentioning/excluding critical data leads me to believe ..... It's still too early to dca into \"value companies.\" There may very well be some fake rallies done by these so called \"dealers\" so they can find bag holders (retail investors) then they'll find positions to take advantage again. \n\nOh right. Midterm election. Lol I dunno if that's not market manipulation , what is.  Anyway, fake rallies, then at least one or two more big drop in the market. \n\nPs Volker back in the days curbed their inflation of like 14% or something by raising rate to 20%. If Powell is so adament on curbing the inflation this time, I'm pretty sure interest rate will have to be much higher than current rate."
