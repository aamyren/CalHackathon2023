  "Text": "b'Hi all. Im newish to options. I bought some Jan 2023 PFE calls ATM that in the past few days are decently ITM and my original 4K is now 6K. Im a couple weeks into this LEAP and was just curious what others here do when there is an early and decent rise in a LEAP.. sell and move on or is it way too early? I know theres a lot about setting up an exit strategy and estimating value etc but Ive never had such a large gain so early. If I was 6 months in I feel I would sell but not sure how I feel this far out. What do you guys do in general?'",

     "Ask yourself a few questions \n\nDo you have an opinion on what\u2019s going to happen?\n\nDid you buy some options and they just worked out? \n\nAre you feeling, I\u2019d be pissed if these went to zero and I lost the money I was up\u2026 buuutt if they keep going I\u2019m going to be pissed I sold? (Thats completely normal)\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about trading you have to take your winners, especially when it comes to Vega heavy options.\n\nIf there is an announcement pending and you happen to get long before and are benefiting from the Vega pop, keep in mind the options can lose value quickly even without a delta move after the announcement.\n\nCouple things I would do \n\n1.  Sell out all of them go into the weekend happy with a 50% winner and enjoy myself and take pfe off my screen for a while and move on to something else\n\n2.  Sell out some of my position and lock in a winner or at least a scratch so I still have a shot at the upside if it really explodes \n\n3.  Sell a call a few handles above the strike I own to spread off some of the Greek risk\n\n4.  Fuck it, it\u2019s just money PFE going to the moon and just hold it\n\nRemember this is a miserable game, you aren\u2019t going to bottom tick/top tick trades\u2026 when you trade a winner you kick yourself for not doing more\u2026 when you trade a loser you kick yourself for doing it\u2026 when you trade out of a winning position you have a feeling of emptiness because the ride is over\u2026 when you puke a loser it\u2019s same emptiness because there\u2019s no more hope of it coming back.\n\nIf your looking for satisfaction or gratification this is the wrong business, the only thing you can do is lock in your winners and move on.\n\nRemember there are 4 scenarios in trading and 3 of them are ok\n\n1. Big wins\n2. Little wins\n3. Little losses\n4. Big losses"

If it works as it is supposed to, this could mean [billions of dollars in revenue] (https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/pfizer-to-exceed-100b-revenue-2022-thanks-to-covid-19-drug-and-vaccine-analyst) for them. It could also go the other way. But Pfizer seems to be doing a good job thus far. Plus they plan to reinvest much of these billions into new drug development, and have narrative going for them. But as others say, you have to make a decision. The nice thing about LEAPS is you have a bit of luxury of time to decide. The price doesn't change crazily from day to day barring massive spikes or drops, and honestly, at this point, your downside isn't that much. The only other question is: what else might you do with the capital?"

     "Any actively managed strategy should have a few things\n\n1. Entrance criteria\n2. Exit Criteria\n3. Management Criteria (at least for options)\n\nYou're going to make hundreds if not thousands of trades. What happens on one trade is almost irrelevant in the long term performance of your strategy. A good trade is defined by whether or not you had a strategy and whether or not you followed it. If you have a strategy and you're following it, that's the right decision.\n\nSo for me, I'm basically a buy and hold investor that uses diagonal spreads to grow my portfolio as if I was holding the underlying equities while I try to mitigate risk. So for my strategy I would answer those questions like this:\n\n1. Entrance criteria: an underlying I think is undervalued and growing, has liquid options, and I can buy a long call 6 months out at a strike roughly equal to the current price \\* 0.8 and can sell a call 1 month out and get enough to offset much of the extrinsic cost of the long call and at a high enough strike to give reasonable room for profit.\n2. Exit criteria: I believe the underlying equity is overvalued either because the fundamentals have changed or because it has grown past a reasonable valuation.\n3. Management criteria: I can adjust my long call to a higher strike that is roughly equal to the new price of the underlying \\* 0.8 and capture some of the gains and reduce my risk. (Plus a lot more here)\n\nThere's other rules for my strategy but you can get the idea. My trades are good if they follow my strategy. My strategy is good if it accomplishes my objectives, for me personally that's to use options to hold positions in equities I like while outperforming someone that held a similar position using stock over the long term.\n\nYou shouldn't be asking us for advice on what to do right now. You should be following your strategy. Anything else won't be consistent, it'll just be lucky."

No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia.

     ">Gain comparison. Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%.\n\nYou can't look at two entities who happen to produce similar products, disregard everything else they're doing, and simply compare market cap growth.\n\nThe COVID vaccine accounts for a vast majority of Moderna's revenue - [in Q2 2021, it accounted for $4.2 billion of its $4.4 billion revenue](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2021-financial).\n\nIn contrast, during the same period, [Pfizer's vaccine accounted for $8 billion of its $19 billion revenue.](https://s21.q4cdn.com/317678438/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-2021-PFE-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nSo you're comparing the 253% growth of Moderna, which has very little revenue if it weren't for the COVID vaccine, to 31% growth of Pfizer, which would've done just fine with all its other revenue streams. In other words, Moderna stock exploded because they went from having some $60 millions in quarterly revenue to $4.4 billion, while Pfizer's went from some $9 billion to $19 billion, and the stock price growth reflects that.\n\nNot saying any of your other points are wrong, just that this comparison isn't valid."

That would require almost a 10-11% move in 14 trading days. A double top on the chart usually indicates a bearish move. Now, with all the vaccine rumors running rampant who knows what could happen with the market in general. I haven\u2019t heard much coming out of PFE but that could just be me. The implied volatility is also low so don\u2019t expect much movement on it. I would look up \u201cthe Greeks\u201d as well, Delta and Theta is what I mainly look at. It\u2019s important to understand those. Would prefer a much larger difference on something that far out.

     "(Copied from dupe)\n\n> Question: Given where I'm sitting, is it reasonable to continue to sit on these calls and wait for the stock to rise more? Do you agree that the stock is likely to continue to rise, at least for the next few weeks? Do you think the QE report, even if it contains mostly good news, could cause the stock price to pull back some?\n\nThe good news is you have a forecast you have conviction about. That's most of the battle. The rest is optimization.\n\nIf it were me (and full disclosure, I Wheel on PFE) I would take the profit now and re-enter a new trade at a lower point of entry (more OTM) AFTER the earnings report, to capture any additional upside. This is particularly true with an earning report coming. You can take advantage of any inflation in IV prior to the ER, and by bailing before the ER, exploiting any IV crush that happens after, reducing your cost basis. You could go for the same expiration or one further out by the same amount as you current hold time."

What's happened recently, these are giant moves for it.  Yes, it's the first name on Trump's lips and retail is sure to pile in further.  I think it could go higher and if I wanted to hold it for more vaccine hope, I'd like it better if it retraced some.  You have to consider what further good news will come and when.  The next bit of great news for the stock would ostensibly be results of a wildly successful phase 2 trial.  We'd estimate that to be what, late August?

Most say there is no info, but this one says there is some slight predictability under the right circumstances using special data not available to the public.\n\nBasically, the answer is \"sorta maybe\", but it's not really tradeable and the actual information you need is not present in the volume alone.  Even with the right data it's not a long term indicator whatsoever, more like minutes.\n\nThis question gets asked a lot here, I normally just say no, but some people swear by put-call ratio or whatever and there just really isn't any evidence for it.

EV investment, debt pay down, etc. Ford indeed is positioning itself well to remain competitive into the future. Margins have been good because of high demand and low inventory.\n\nThe issue is, most of the good news about Ford has them been merely doing whats necessary to compete in the new EV future. Thise EV cars they sell won't be a new source of revenue, but merely a replacement for the lost revenue from gasoline cars that won't be sold. Ford is a car company still. One that probably won't fall behind in the new era, but not one that justifies the high growth stock metrics it has right now. \n\nFords price as of this writing is pretty close to the consensus 12 month price targets that have updated since earnings. All that good news caused a lot of buyers quick, leaving very little room for error. \n\nTake your gains, reevaluate Ford and decide what to do when the price gets back down around 17."

If regular energy goes down in price alternative energy usually takes it, just or not.\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't sound like you can consider selling the call far enough out that you could have the stock sale count as Long Term Capital Gains.

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper.

I rarely ever held through any earnings because despite personal bias, there could be surprise from earning reports that make me want to reevaluate my thesis (I.e. snap). You can make more than 1.5% but that requires more work and good risk management. You might be lucky and hit 5% in one month but could lose it in another if you slip on your stock and strike selections and left bag holding worthless stocks. If you want more than 2% a month, that usually meant giving up something - either riskier strike, shorter dte, higher IV, more active management, leveraging, etc. There is no free lunch. \n\nWheeling is slow and boring. Most do not have the discipline, patience, and ended up giving up or worst, yoloed onto buying options because they made good gain from months of selling options. I think you should give it another go. Anyways, if you do, we have a small discord focuses on selling. Feel free to dm if you\u2019re interested."

     "The underlying assumption of wheeling is no different from buying and holding stocks or buying call options. They are all bullish strategies which rely on stocks going up. How is wheeling different then? It is more mechanical, gives you more control (e.g. point of entry, strike selection, capital requirements, cost basis reduction etc.) and it gives you two fold advantage over buying stocks out right - IV crush and time (theta) decay. Again your basic assumption in all of these cases is same. \n\nSince it's a bullish strategy, it might not give consistent profits if we see a period of relentless bear market. We seem to see new traders making a great return beating S&P because we have had more than a year of bull market and high IV environments. \n\nIn a nutshell, consistent high returns are possible but it does not come from one or two strategies. You might see a year with 40% return and another with -10% but on a long term you will come out as a winner if you stick to basics of options trading, deploy different strategies depending on market conditions, diversify and trade often enough."

     "I'll try to help you out.  If you are willing to put that entire $25k into one basket each week, I would suggest selling iron condors on an index, like $SPX.  SPX uses European style options, meaning there is no early assignment risk and it is cash settled, so no shares.  They have expiry 3x a week as well, so you could run this strategy 3x per week to be a bit riskier and make a bit more but have to deal with tighter wings.\n\nIf you follow the typical iron condor strategy I have heard of 1 Standard deviation shorts then you are looking at approximately 0.15 delta short calls and puts and then buy your protection leg at the immediate preceding strike.  Just an example for this week (Oct 29 expiry), you are selling a $4475 put, buying a $4470 put, selling a $4595 call and buying a $4600 call.  Assuming you get filled exactly at the mid price means you will see approximately $130 in returns while risking $370 in max loss.  This is much better than seeing $40 in returns and risking $4000 Wheeling something like PFE (even though PFE is safe).\n\nIs this a perfect strategy? No, it does require some maintenance to make sure it isn't blowing through your strike.  This would cost you about $20,000 - $25,000 in maintenance each week but would get you to your goal of approx. $500 a month in income from your living room.  With an iron condor, you are betting on the price staying within the two short wings.  This is typically a much easier bet on an index that isn't going to see huge parabolic moves up or down one day to the next.  \n\nAnother option is the iron butterfly, where you will actually see a good risk to reward (usually 3-4x) if you plan your strikes well.  Just be aware that you very rarely, if ever, going to see your max gain on these.  The goal is for price to stay within your breakevens.  However, if price does see a large move up or down, you are risking far more than the iron condor and could see upwards of a $2000 loss.  With the butterflies you can play them as a dead-neutral strategy where you aim to sell the calls and puts ATM, or you can play them a bit more directional where you are limiting your loss exponentially while still keeping those huge risk to reward returns, but your chance of profitability (expiring within the strikes) drops considerably.  \n\nNone of these are easy money like you think but they are easier money than trying to pick a stock that isn't going to fall apart or is going to continue trending higher over the coming weeks/months."

The wings carry extremely significant tail risk that will materialize eventually.\n\nThe problem with having such low probability trades is you have to increase your contract sizes to increase your premium, in turn increasing your delta and by extension your delta expansion risk. Every single professional or retail trader that relies on a tail heavy strategy and leverage goes under unless they hedge and decrease their already small relative return per risk. Their hedge becomes an extremely large portion of their overall return drag. Karen the Super Trader is famous for it.\n\nYour best risk adjusted returns always come from ATM. From there you can naturally increase your probability by managing optimally. 25% profit or same strike roll when appropriate will net 90+% win rates and give you many advantages such as margin expansion safety and more return per contract even after adjusting for success probability."

I started the acct with $500 and got lucky with debit call spread with CSCO, PFE, and F along with a short strangle 1SD of PTON that finally brought me to $1000. Then I used this BP to buy ATVI because IV rank is so high.\\n\\nI use tastyworks and I learned from their free classes, so I sold a 1 SD strangle at 55 and 72.5 because IV was high. Held for about a week and don't see IV coming down, instead it kept going up. Set closing position at 50% max profit like tasty taught.\\n\\nThis morning after the 25% increase my short call is now ITM, negative $850 loss if i were to close the strangle, and in negative BP. I have 31 days to expiration. \\n\\nShould I close right now and take the loss, or wait until like 21 days to close hoping it would drop below 72.5? or should I put some money into the acct and roll the 55 to current 1SD?\\n\\nThanks\"",

Example companies are AAPL, MCD, AXP, PFE, CSCO, INTC, etc... \\n\\nI aim to make about 15% per year with this strategy, and have been successful at doing this for the past few years.

     "My quoted 15% figure is my aim per trade. I havent been perfect about tracking it across my entire portfolio though. I will go through periods of heavier trading, and periods without any trades, like when all my capital is tied up. My goal here is to establish a track record with some level of accountability, to determine if my strategies outperform the market, and to gauge community interest in following this type of strategy. \n\nIf my results are strong, I could see this becoming  a business I develop one day. Like a weekly options newsletter, or subscription site, or something like that. I don't have the web design nor the tech skills to do this myself, but it's an idea that could take shape in theory. Right now I just want to see how I do though. I could easily go down in flames and conclude what I'm doing is less effective than just buying the SPY or something. In which case I'll gladly change up my investing strategy and swap my options research time for fishing. \n\nSkeptics and challenges are all welcomed. I know the market has been in a tear lately, so I'm not claiming to be doing something ultra special here. I just know it works for me, and I like the idea pf collecting cash premiums, and occasionally dividends, as a steady stock just treads water. \n\nI do trade for income for the most part, but ideally I don't pull all the income out each month. The more I can keep in there the more I have to trade with. I don't make enough for a full time living from trading, but I'd like to one day, so I try to let the portfolio total build as much as I can.\n\nI use interactive brokers exclusively, so commissions are kind of negligible as far as I'm concerned.  \n\nI'm also not too familiar with reddit and the established comment etiquette. I likely wont take the time to respond to each comment individually, but I will read them as I can and answer things in bulk. \n\nAlso, as I establish a track record, should I edit the original post to list positions as they are picked, and just make a running list of opened, closed, profit/loss, etc... Or should each trade be it's own new post?"

     "One reason we can speculate the volatility of Hershey's might go up, is that they were caught buying cocoa beans on options exchanges, trying to avoid buying from the facility set up with anti-child labor protections.\n\n1. Hershey's options purchases of cocoa beans send beans up higher 6 days ago: https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2020/11/22/cocoa-futures-skyrocket-thanks-reported-hersheys-trade\n\n2. None of this gets much notice, including when West African countries busted Hershey & threatened reprisal, except after the dispute is \"settled\" and Hershey's stock price actually ROSE for that reason 3 days ago: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/07/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-iac/interactive-ford-eastman-kodak-more.html. So far, Hershey's just sees net gains due to its bad behavior.\n\n3. But in the past couple of days, Hershey's child-labor cocoa beans buys is starting to get some attention. See this NBC article yesterday: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/national-international/the-war-on-cocoa-hershey-co-accused-of-not-upholding-sustainability-efforts-in-west-africa/2421880/\n\nPersonally, I think Hershey's needs to be called out for its child labor cocoa beans buys, because it's not the first time it's been caught trying to undercut basic price controls in what is already one of the lowest-wage regions of the world, with or without child labor.  They also were called out for child labor chocolate in 2019:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/hershey-nestle-mars-chocolate-child-labor-west-africa/\n\nThis is literally just brutally greedy behavior, because it's practically impossible to find labor that is cheaper than what these workers already make with the price controls. \n\nI'm seriously considering attacking Hershey stock on one of Reddit's forums, because they have been continuing to engage in this behavior. Stockholder activism is sometimes the only way these companies change abuses. \n\ntldr; Hershey's has been secret-buying child labor cocoa beans on options exchanges this year, and has been a problem behind child labor cocoa for years, in fact. It stock deserves some volatility right about now. This is a heads up I might post a rant about Hershey's behavior, asking for stockholder activism next week."

The tool is inclusive of almost 1,000 tickers now.\\n\\n**What is this tool good for**\\n\\nI posted in ThetaGang the list with HIGH IV options which is great for running the wheel or selling options. This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher. Do your DD before entering any positions!\\n\\n# Low IV Tickers List\\n\\n\\\\*Some of the market cap data is off, so always double check before entering any plays!\\n\\nPlease note this list is only inclusive of the more popular tickers mentioned around Reddit.

I don't have the capital to hold that many shares and don't know if I can sell them AH. \n\nNormally you would request exercise (you have between 60 and 90 min after the close to do this) and hedge with short stock to lock in a profit. Since you don't have the capital there's nothing you can do. You can request exercise and if you have a margin account it might go through, putting you in a margin call which you need to get out of monday morning. Not to mention that you would take weekend risk which could be catastrophic and where you could lose more than the original cost of your calls."

     "If i understand you correctly, you own several hundred shares of the stocks you listed and you want to figure out how to sell covered calls on them?\n\nThe easiest way to ballpark this strategy is to define at what point you are 100% okay having your shares called away from you. I'll use AAPL as an example.\n\nAAPL closed today at $99.96. For simplicity, lets assume you purchased the stock at $94 a while back. \n\nHow much more potential upside do you think AAPL has in the next 30 days? $5? $10? Let's say $5.\n\nRight now, the Aug 26 $105 strike calls have a bid price of .78. That means for every 100 shares of AAPL you own, you can sell 1 call for $78 (.78*100 shares in 1 options contract). If you own 300 shares of AAPL, you can sell 3 covered calls for a total credit of $234. \n\nI'm selecting the August 26 expiration date because Theta (time decay) begins to accelerate in your favor during the last 4 weeks of the contract's life.\n\nNow lets say AAPL misses earnings on Tuesday. The stock goes down to $96 and the calls you sold go down in value to .36 per contract (random number).\n\nYou have 2 options. \n\nOption 1: If you think AAPL will either stay still or trade within a channel, you can wait until the August 26 expiration and the options you sold expire worthless and you can keep the full premium.\n\nOption 2: You can buy back the 3 calls you sold for $36 each, pocketing the spread between the $78 credit you received and the $36 current value of the calls. This nets out to $42 per contract or $126 profit of the total $234 potential profit. \n\nNow let's say AAPL rallies and surges to $110. The calls you sold are now ITM and your 300 shares are liable to be \"called away from you\". This means that you are forced to sell your shares at $105 each even tho the current share price is $110. You miss out on an addition $5 of profit but since you're already profitable on the shares, this might not bother you.\n\nHope this helps/answers your question. Let me know if i can clarify anything. Best of luck."

Now I have purchased stock at $60, so I am fine with selling at 90 with the 10 premium, thus $100.

In both cases, you will make money if the stocks stay flat. \n\nWith the put strategy though, you'll be on the hook to purchase shares at the put strike prices if these stocks tank. You better have the capital to back up these purchases (enough to buy 100 shares per contract), otherwise you'll be in for a world of hurt.\n\nWith the call strategy, you'll make money if the stock stays flat, if it goes down a little, and even if the stock increases in price above the strikes and you're forced to sell your shares. You'll also make money on the dividends in the meanwhile. This is why I love covered calls--three ways to win money."

  "Text": "b'Im having trouble wrapping my head around writing covered calls. From the basic knowledge I have, you would write a covered call if your sentiment is neutral to negative  meaning you would youre your stock price to remain at the money or below. However, when I look at option chains and I see the premiums, etc. Im not understanding why anyone would do ITM/ATM calls. Below is a situation of what Im not understanding:\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIll use Pfizer (PFE) as the stock. Today is 7/8/2016 and currently, the stock price is trading at $35.85. The Jul 15, 2016 (7 days to expiration) option call chain is priced as such:\\n\\nMoney | Premium | Strike\\n------|---------|-------\\nITM | $1.41 | 34.50\\nITM | $0.93 | 35.00\\nATM | $0.51 | 35.50\\nOTM | $0.20 | 36.00\\nOTM | $0.06 | 36.60\\n\\nWhy would anyone write an ITM or ATM covered call? Wouldnt you basically be assigned right away and you basically lose money?\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nIf I wrote a 35.00 Strike, I would make the premium, right? So in this instance I would make $0.9'",

     "I think you have a couple of misunderstandings.  A covered call is a bullish strategy.  You want tot he stock to go up.  You will still make money if it stays the same or goes down a little collecting the time decay of the short option, but it is a long delta position.\n\nSecond, even if you sell an ATM or ITM strike, there is still time value left in that option and the person on the other side of the trade isn't going to exercise it since they'd instantly lose that premium.  In your example, of you sold the ATM strike for $0.51, and the counter party immediately exercised it, they's but the stock from you at $35.50, they would have effectively paid $35.50 + $0.51 for it when they could have bought it in the open market for $35.50.  The same logic holds for ITM strikes as long as there is still time value left in the option.\n\nAnother way to think about it is a covered cal is identical to a naked put at the same strike.  Selling an ITM call against long stock is he same as selling a put at the same strike which by definition is OTM.  Why would someone exercise an OTM put when the stock is trading at a higher price?"

     "You will never get assigned right away if you do not open completely ridiculous positions.\n\nIf you write a covered call you want to sell the stocks, you can do that ATM and get the most cash for the option, but you will probably get assigned to deliver once the stock is higher than strike price+premium, I'm more a fan of put options but you can combine those two well to get rid of stocks you never really wanted."
