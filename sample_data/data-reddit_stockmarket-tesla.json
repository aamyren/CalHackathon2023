This works because AI is a set of algorithms that use data pattern recognition and the sensors on the Movella suits provide generated and aggregated data.

It feels like they are soooo close to nailing it, but that's been the case for a year now... they just can't cross the finish line. \n\nBut, they are close enough that it's almost unthinkable that they won't achieve it at some point in the near future (ie. a couple years max).

Yes, opening up their network to others will help, but this is also another revenue stream for Tesla too. \n\nTesla has building EVs at scale in a profitable manner down very well & have battery supply issues solved more than anyone. They have a lot of pricing flexibility.\n\nTheir buying process is more appealing to anyone under 60.\n\nThe bad:\n\nEV competition is heating up, with more options, people no longer have to buy a Tesla if they want an EV. The overall EV pie may continue to grow, but I see their piece shrinking.\n\nMusk\u2019s association is a turn off to some potential buyers\n\nUnless the cyber truck has something spectacular that\u2019s been kept under wraps, they\u2019ve waited too long to enter the truck market segment with an odd design that lacks mass appeal\n\nActual full self driving remains a pipe dream \n\nTheir lead in tech in general is rapidly shrinking as they\u2019ve basically not innovated much of anything for years. \n\nLastly, yes, while I believe they will continue to do well as a car company, there\u2019s no reason for the stock to ballon back to previous levels either as their is no \u2018wow\u2019 factor there anymore nor any on the horizon."

More than double. \n\nThey are opening new plants/factories in multiple locations all over the world. Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. \n\nIn comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That\u2019s per company. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a company that can produce at Tesla\u2019s speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it\u2019s going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That\u2019s 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that\u2019s a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. \n\nI know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. \n\nTesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years. That\u2019s 14 years. \n\nThat\u2019s millions of teslas and counting on the road for years to come before any other company comes even close to producing cars as fast as Tesla.

Even in the most absurdly bullish case possible Tesla was never going to maintain a 72.7% share of the EV market in California.\n\nThe better metrics to look at are 1) how many vehicles are Tesla selling in California, and 2) what's their market share in the total California Auto Market?\n\nThink of it this way,  Apple was the first company to sell smartphones, so they once controlled 100% of that market segment. Does the fact that Apple now only controls a fraction of the global smartphone sales today because other companies jumped into the smartphone market mean that Apple was a terrible investment? No of course not, Apple is selling more smartphones then they ever were back when they controlled 100% of the smartphone market."

     "\"Tesla vehicles are so bad.\"\n\nModel Y is the best selling vehicle by revenue for year 2022.\n\nIt will be the best selling vehicle by unit sales for year 2023. I'll repeat: The Model Y will be the best selling vehicle in year 2023, outselling the Rav4 and Corolla, while having luxury vehicle prices.\n\nYou guys are here to complain about the 1% of vehicles that have a slight issue that can be fixed easily.\n\n\"The interior is cheap.\"\n\nIt's a minimalist design. If that doesn't suit you and you want thousands of parts in your vehicle, go for it. Have fun paying to get it fixed eventually down the line.\n\n\"It's not safe to drive.\"\n\nLiterally one of the safest vehicles you CAN drive because there is no engine, the battery sits on the bottom meaning you have a low center of gravity, and the steel framing of the vehicle absorbs a crap ton of the damage during a crash. You may have heard the story of someone who intentionally drove their Tesla down a cliff to commit suicide with his family inside and they survived with quite minimal injuries. In fact, Tesla has probably the safest vehicle scores tested in their Model S, Y, and E.\n\n\"Their interior is cheap. That's how they are able to make high margins.\"\n\nThe interior isn't luxury but that's not what you're buying a Tesla for. You're buying it for the technology they offer, supercharging network, more reliable EV, and the fact that other EV makers just aren't capable of producing a similar EV product. When you can play Steam games, have OTA updates to improve the cameras of your vehicle without replacing them, increase the efficiency of vehicle range, etc., let me know. No one comes close to Tesla in software and tech capabilities. If the tech isn't for you, don't buy a Tesla. It's really that simple. You're wasting your money.\n\nThe reason Tesla's margins are higher has to do with lower battery costs, lack of a dealership network, way more efficient manufacturing processes, and they are a master at saving money because they worked at the company since the inception and know every part that isn't required. Current legacy automakers leadership took over when those car companies have been constructing vehicles for nearly a century. They're more concerned with the financials than the engineering within the company which is why they allowed some random guy who owned PayPal to come in and dominate the EV industry despite having no experience in vehicles. Musk was in Tesla before they even had a vehicle out so they had to start from point A and thus, everything was designed for maximum efficiency and lower cost.\n\nAgain, if the tech isn't for you, please do NOT buy a Tesla. There are better vehicles at that price you can buy. But if the tech is something that you enjoy using, it's one of the best vehicles to drive."

     "Apparently, this seems to be a popular post on Reddit as I have seen it in 3 subs already. I am posting what I have already posted in another sub here.\n\nThis is one of those articles that presents selective data to highlight a narrative. To be honest, even that is not done very well. :) Don\u2019t get me wrong. I understand that Tesla has a significant advantage at the moment given its manufacturing muscle. However, the situation is not as dire for other companies as the article tries to portray. Remember, Tesla was in the same state as others just a few years ago.\n\nAnyway, first things first. Despite the article\u2019s intention, the authors had to present some kind of comparison data to appear fair. Unfortunately, they cherry pricked reporting data for different timeframes for different companies. Even then, it is not difficult to see numbers that matter by paying attention.\n\nFor example, Nio\u2019s net loss(not gross) per vehicle was -$19k per vehicle in q4 2020 and it was estimated around -$13 k in Q3 2022.  It\u2019s gross profit was actually around +$10k in q4 of 2020 and Tesla\u2019s was around $10.5 k. Of course, the article doesn\u2019t show the gross profit for q3 22 for Nio.. :) Same applies to most other car companies data in their \u2018analysis\u2019 if we can call it.\n\nWhen one is ramping up production and other costs, it is expected to eat into net profits. All in all, this is a very misleading article focusing on selective facts without providing proper context."

He was granted options and, back in December he put a 10b5-1 plan in place to exercise and monetize those options over time.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what 10b5 is, Google it.  The rule was just expanded (requiring more information from sellers and increasing the conditions that must be met in order to qualify) by the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler in December 2022.\n\nHad this not been a 10b5-1 sale he would not have been allowed to sell the exercised shares so close to earnings. \n\nNot only does the timing mean nothing, it\u2019s existence would have been disclosed in Tesla\u2019s last quarterly report, so this shouldn\u2019t be news at all to anyone who is particularly worried about this sort of thing.\n\nYahoo!

And since this is a stock sub that\u2019s good news for Tesla STOCK. Y\u2019all thought buying Tesla cars when they were super high was some sort of elite club you were forming, reality was supply, and demand, and all you did was all in FOMO. Tons of people said wait until prices readjusted, but nooo, you wanted to be first, and you paid the price. Nothing to be salty about. You wanted, you got, now you regret it, and somehow that too is Elon\u2019s fault. \nI\u2019m glad to see the price come down, I hope they sell even more, because I own stock in the company, and I\u2019m not trying to be in some kindergarten exclusive club.

Otherwise, Tesla may become a niche EV manufacturer with maybe 15% market share in the already tiny EV sector just 6% or so of all automobiles sold are electric.  And Tesla / Elon Musk apparently did not foresee the big picture, involving infrastructure, supply chain materials problems including access to rare earth metals and regulatory issues on autonomous vehicle technology, a feature that weighs heavily in Tesla's valuation. Further, the lack of lithium reserves worldwide are now driving the development of alternatives like sodium ion battery technology.  So, examining Elon Musk's shift to buy Twitter indicates he either wanted to diversify money out of the EV market purposely because he recognized the limitations coming, which essentially left investors holding the bag ... or he made a bad choice, given Twitter adds no short-term value to Tesla. Elon could just as well have bought a sodium ion battery company which would have made a lot more sense adding significant value to Tesla, enriching investors."

In segments where Tesla and BYD compete head to head, Tesla outsells BYD - the Model 3 and Y way outsell the BYD Seal, Han, and Tang in the \u00a5200-\u00a5300k price range (and this is on BUD\u2019s home turf, it barely exists outside of China and Tesla dominates in US and even Europe). Once Tesla releases a model under \u00a5200k, BYD might not be the leader in China anymore, and Tesla\u2019s margin advantage and lower prices recently will put pressure on BYD\u2019s profits in the meantime."

In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.\\n\\nTesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Teslas NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.\\n\\nGMs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w6kuajo6x5b1.png?width=732&fo\"",

     "Would think so. \n\nHAving done some sums, I don't think the truck is actually all that special. For example, Volvo's Class 8 EV truck the VNR, it its top form has a 565 kWh battery and a claimed 275 mi range. So it's about 2 kWh/mi or thereabouts. Tesla are claiming 500 mi? 2 kWh/mi?  So I think they're not really ahead in terms of efficiency or anything, but would seem to have a lead on packaging. For their claim they need about twice the battery and I guess a clean-sheet design would allow them to package that in better than the old guard.\n\nThe real meat is whether they've made something that, in 500,000 miles, still works great. They're not known for building particularly high quality cars are they. That kind of performance will not wash in the heavy duty market. It just won't.\n\nAs an aside, I didn't realise, but it seem Volvo have quite the range of applications for their EV trucks. They have a pretty wide offering!"

The stock is very overpriced and this information is irrelevant as it fails to justify the high market cap and and high multiples. The share value is based on both the actual growth and innovation as a company as well as \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d for future prospects that are difficult to justify. It often seems that the stock, itself, is more acting as a catch- all for electric vehicle investment.\n\n2. Regardless of the intrinsic value of the stock, positive news like this will cause positive investor sentiment. The price is already wildly high so it\u2019s very possible that any bit of optimistic view will continue to push it up (at least, to a point.)\n\nNot knowing the future the company could be undervalued for all I know. I tend to think the high price isn\u2019t justified, but again, we\u2019re all just going off our best estimates. I tend to think that the price is unreasonable and unsustainable, but regardless of that news and sentiment can keep stock prices unreasonable for unreasonable periods of time."

Ford and GM are not. I\u2019ll be happy to see more EVs on the road in general and this move does that. Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. They\u2019re staying true to that."

I don\u2019t know if Tesla has anything in place for price drops on purchased vehicles or not, but to give an example on how they could correct this in good faith, give a refund back to their customers who purchased a Tesla in a given timeframe for the difference in price.\n\nI\u2019ll rip a page from the Apple playbook:\nhttps://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/sales-policies/retail_us.html\n\n\u201cPricing and Price Reductions/Corrections\n\u2026\n\nShould Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to visit an Apple Retail Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events, such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday.\u201d\n\nSo if I bought a MacBook Pro 5 days ago and Apple dropped the price today, I could call Apple and get a refund for the difference in price. Tesla could do the same thing with their vehicles if they wanted to. Again, I don\u2019t know what kind, if any, price guarantee Tesla has."

Had it for 6 months, deployed for a year, get home & was walking thru Wal Mart when I saw my TV on sale for $175. I was still paying off the store card I bought it with. \n\nTwo things didn't happen after that day: I never bought brand new premium electronics from the store ever again. I also didn't write the CEO of Panasonic or LG or the Walton family crying about how the price change makes my stuff more affordable for the poors, or demand the difference. What reality do these spoiled entitled fckwads live in??"

I personally like the Jaguar I-PACE and Mustang Mach-E over the Tesla (brid car) Model X\u2026\n\nPlus Tesla doesn\u2019t even feel exclusive or luxurious anymore bc you\u2019ll notice every mofo looking douchey as fuck in their Tesla\u2026 (I am Asian in the Chicago suburbs) and legit every brown motherfucker has that car here and they just look so full of themselves, I did a test drive at a dealership once in the model X and I just felt awkward and grossed out driving it\u2026 (I could just feel the douchynes vibes flowing off of me)\u2026 I\u2019m glad in the end we opted out to get Audi Q4 E-Tron"

It's not too expensive for any of the companies I'm working with and they're frothing at the bit to get their hands on a bunch. It'll change the way they'll demo their products. It'll change the way they'll design the layouts of their systems inside of buildings. They tried it with the hololens and that kinda worked, but this is so much better already.\n\nPeople here seem to forget that Apple didn't use to focus on the consumer market at all, that kinda came when Jobs introduced the iPod. Before that, Apple was known for making expensive but quality business hardware and software with consumer products being less of a priority for most generations. And they kinda never really stopped. The Mac Pro is not meant for regular consumers (although I'm sure some got one). Let alone things like the Pro Display XDR that was memed on heavily for being an expensive display, but is considered by professionals one of the best displays in the field for its purpose and price.\n\nIt's a useful skill to realize that if you're not the target audience for something, that doesn't mean there is none."

Somebody asks me if I\u2019m going to get Covid next year and I reply with \u201cnot planning on it\u201d. If I do end up getting Covid the next year does it mean that I was lying? Obviously not."

It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).\r  \n\r  \nIt operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).\r  \n\r  \nIt does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.\r  \n\r  \nDespite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).\r  \n\r\r  \nAll this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history.\n\nAnd that's just the auto business.\n\nI am adding at these levels."

Companies are really the present value of discounted future cash flows.\n\nThis year, Tesla will post ~$10B free cash flow (up 100% from last year, 258% from 2 years ago, and 827% from 3 years ago). Now let\u2019s do a simple and conservative 10 year discounted cash flow with the following assumptions:\n\n1.\t\u2060\u2060\u206012% discount rate in the 10 year period\n2.\t\u2060\u2060\u20608% terminal discount rate\n3.\t\u2060\u2060\u20603% terminal growth rate inline with GDP growth, and less than half S&P 500 long term earnings growth rate.\n4.\t\u2060\u2060\u206040% free cash flow growth in the first year that glides down linearly to 3% over the 10 years. This averages out to a compound annual growth rate of 23%, which is similar to Apple/Google over the 10 years after they first reached ~$10b FCF.\n\nThe result of such a DCF is a present value of $190 per share with quite conservative assumptions. There is plenty of upside: increase the growth rate in the 10 year period or the terminal period, decrease the discount rate to be more inline with S&P 500 returns, and you can make bull cases several times higher than today\u2019s Tesla price."

It also funds research and grants among other things, but for this discussion we are focusing on \"charity\" because that is what the headlines claim. \n\nOf course it will be pointed out that this is how all rich people arrange their charitable giving...and that is fine, if those foundations are actually then passing those funds on to actual charities. \n\nLast year, after his widely publicized _\"charitable donation\"_ of $5.7b, the Musk Foundation was valued at approximately $9.4b. \n\nOf that amount, approx $160m was donated to _actual charitable causes_. \n\nThis represented approximately 1.7% of the Musk Foundation assets. \n\nA more informative and accurate headline would read...\n\nOne of the worlds richest billionaires gives only a minuscule percentage of his net worth to charitable causes.\n\nMy Mom gives a higher percentage of her net worth to charity than he does."

     "I guess stock manipulation is perfectly legal now, if you have a team of lawyers. Y\u2019all remember that HUGE Russian hack in December 2020? Where many many governments & corporation secrets where stolen. That hack was obviously coordinated with China/Russia. And China is now giving that stolen IP to Elon to break into various sectors of the US market. There\u2019s nothing genius about Elon, except he\u2019s willing to betray the US. The betrayal likely started in 2018 when China awarded him the 1st \u201cindependently owned\u201d factory in China owned by a foreigner. You think he got this special status factory because the CCP loves him? You don\u2019t get to do business in China without being required to partner with a Chinese company OR the Chinese GOVERNMENT. Elon is not a genius, he\u2019s a rich kid with a engineering & marketing degree. He\u2019s been buying ads & paying influencers to market himself as a genius. Is all smoke & mirrors. The stupid purchase of Twitter was not his choice. He was ordered by Xi to own it or destroy it in the process, because China saw Twitter as a threat. \n\nAlso, Elon is not the only person that China is giving stolen IP to. There are many others. I also suspect China gave stolen IP to OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, which Elon & Peter Thiel are investors. There are way too many coincidences & it\u2019s becoming clear to me that Russia/China have been using stolen IP in plain sight. But the thing is, every major government is aware of this. That\u2019s why Russia is so dependent on China. India has been buying Russian oil at a discount too, but the jury is still out if the people of India will be a Chinese puppet & do China\u2019s bidding. In the meantime we will all act stupid like we don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on because we need China to cooperate in lowering green house emissions. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t keep the best chips out of Chinas hands by coordinating with major chip makers. Europe has recently agreed to keep cutting-edge chip factory equipment out of China. China is screwed. The longer they take to make a FAIR trade deal, the worse it\u2019s going to be for them in the long run, because the world will find new supply chains outside of China & Russia. For example the Biden administration has already partnered with northern Africa to supply Europe with natural gas. Taiwan & S Korea are making chip factories in the US to be completed in 2025. \n\nThe sad thing is, there are a large number of US voters that have fallen for crazy Qanon conspiracies spread by Russia & China. Promoting Trump as some messiah, very similar to Elon. The Republican Party knows this & instead of splitting the party are acting stupid & hoping Trump dies soon. The Dems can\u2019t do anything about it because anything they say is always label fake news. And frankly Trump or any extreme GOP candidate getting the nomination is good news for Dems but dangerous for democracy. As we saw in the midterms, the US voters are tired of the extremist Republican Party, but the GOP doesn\u2019t seem to care what voters want. I have no loyalty to the Dems but Biden had done a great job against China/Russia & the Republican Party has a long way to go before it can get me to support them. It\u2019s looking like splitting the party is the only way out of this mess. A short term loss, but a HUGE win in the long run.  \n\nI welcome any comment on my analysis. Btw, Peter Thiel is a major investor in Reddit. Peter Thiel, who went on a tour promoting Bitcoin in 2022, while his firm SOLD $1.8 BILLION of their Bitcoin as he was pumping it. Bitcoin was always a Chinese weapon against the US dollar. The world is in a permanent state of cyberwar. People are just oblivious to that fact, & are too addicted to their phone to do anything about how negatively it\u2019s affecting their mental health. The best thing one can do is probably delete the Twitter & Facebook app from your phone IMHO. I did it & have no regrets. These are many alternatives to wean off the addiction to social media. \n\nhttps://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/18/peter-thiels-founders-fund-sold-crypto-just-before-markets-soured/"

     "You only have to be super alert in city blocks and weird intersections. In highways, it is practically flawless. \n\nIt's $15k for the lifetime of the vehicle. I don't know where you are getting the per year amount. Please do the appropriate basic research next time.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOcSEX-8rTg&ab\\_channel=VehicleVirgins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOcSEX-8rTg&ab_channel=VehicleVirgins)\n\nGo watch the video above. It's not perfect, obviously, but if it can shave 80% of your driving for you and you're someone who commutes every day, if you own that vehicle for 8 years, it would only cost you around $2k per year. \n\nOther companies can't charge you for it because they have geofenced technology. Meaning, companies like Waymo and other self-driving technology only work for a certain area (a small town here or there in various areas). Tesla FSD is designed to work everywhere. Again, yes, it's still got ways to go but please look at the data. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport#:\\~:text=Q1%202019-,In%20the%201st%20quarter%2C%20we%20recorded%20one%20crash%20for%20every,every%201.24%20million%20miles%20driven](https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport#:~:text=Q1%202019-,In%20the%201st%20quarter%2C%20we%20recorded%20one%20crash%20for%20every,every%201.24%20million%20miles%20driven).\n\nTesla FSD+AP has fewer accidents than a Tesla vehicle that isn't using FSD+AP. In fact, it has 8x fewer accidents than your average person driving a vehicle. \n\nIt's high margins because it's mainly an operating cost concern involving data centers and employees working on FSD. The gross cost to add FSD is slim depending on how much you want to add the value based on the cameras and hardware they have already with the vehicle. High operating leverage = more profit when scaled.\n\nI'll tell you right now: Any company that solves full-self driving capabilities will instantaneously become the most valuable company in the world. That is why FSD is intriguing. The ability to get from point A to point B without having to control the steering is priceless. $15k is a bargain if Tesla is able to achieve that. Currently, yes, I wouldn't pay $15k because I rarely drive here in NYC with my Tesla and because with the way I drive, I probably wouldn't have access to FSD (you need to reach a certain safety score to have access to FSD. This is how Tesla prevents, to the best of their ability, reckless drivers). The application of this is also in semi-trucks. That's a huge aspect of this you are missing. Companies operating semi-trucks will pay hundreds of thousands for this type of technology per truck, EASILY. My guess is it will be around 2030-early 2030 when FSD becomes fully operational as intended. As of now, people are paying for it because it's mostly wealthier people who can afford it and also, if your driving route includes a highway with lots of traffic during peak time, it's only $2k per year (assuming you keep your vehicle for 8 years). Not exactly a huge cost."

     "$7500 tax credit moved forward, which has already drawn down existing inventory in the US.\n\nFurthermore, Tesla has fallen below 400B in market cap, P/E has dropped below 40, forward P/E  at 23, PEG at .78 (undervalued in traditional terms). It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).\r  \n\r  \nIt operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).\r  \n\r  \nIt does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.\r  \n\r  \nDespite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).\r  \n\r\r  \n\rAll this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history."

     "So many comments here don\u2019t understand what ESG is the the methodology used to develop the score and annual list. Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance aka ESG. Three prongs taken at equal weights. Most companies can get an easy score on the Social aspect but not always, same with Governance. Environment is different because the way it\u2019s calculated is kind of antiquated. \n\nThere\u2019s really two main parts to a company\u2019s score, the company\u2019s own response to S&P to about 100 or so questions and 500-1000 data points collected. Then take into account that S&P regularly changes the methodology for calculation as well. \n\n\nSome companies know how to answer the questions better than some, which is why they stay on the list. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s Tesla\u2019s issues, just pointing it out. We all know the oil and gas industry has some powerhouse PR as proven every time the have an oil spill. \n\n\nThe data points include things like social and environmental campaigns run by the companies. Like when Exxon says they\u2019re developing cleaner technologies to drill oil, we all know that it can never be clean but it\u2019s \u201ccleaner\u201d (take that with a big grain of salt) so they get good marks for it. We all know it\u2019s BS but we turn a blind eye because we need gas. \n\n\nI read Tesla had racial bias and sexual harassment claims, all companies do, but being a tech company in the Bay Area will generally lead to more than one in Houston. Not that Tesla has more, but from my wife and MIL\u2019s years in HR, people at tech companies feel more empowered to report compared to companies run by and with the \u201cgood ol boy\u201d culture. There\u2019s actually a big push in the oil & gas industry to change that, same for my industry - Supply chain & Logistics. \n\n\nSaying all that to say, this isn\u2019t blow back against Elon for the twitter deal or crap like that, these were calculated weeks/months ago.\n\n\nEdit: if you want to know more than some click bait articles you can read up about it here: [S&P methodolgy](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/products-benefits/products/esg-evaluation)"

     "Best advice I could give you is to not beat yourself up too much. Everyone gets carried away with the market at some point.\n\nIf I was you, and I wasn't trading on borrowed money, I would take the hit on the chin and accept that you fucked up but it cant really get much worse than it is at present. Hell, some of the stocks are at levels that could be pretty good buy points. But some also aren't. I would just stop looking at them for a couple of months.\n\nUse the break to invest in yourself. Learn some basic TA, which can help you to not step on so many landmines. Look at a simple Bollinger band. 20 period. If the monthly close price isn't above the center line and the line isn't trending up then the stock isn't something you should be investing in. Simple momentum. There's plenty of other TA if you want to get a bit trickier. Just remember to KISS. And don't take advice on individual stocks from anyone. How do you know they aren't looking to unload their stocks onto you....  Best of luck."

Before the pandemic, a number of these stocks were great medium to long term performers while Tesla\u2019s balance sheet issues were sufficient enough to cause people to cast doubt on its future as a public company. \n\nYou have 2 major issues. One is understanding why you own certain names. For example, relative to 2020-21 when nearly everyone was wfh, will there be more usage of zoom\u2019s core product in 2023? How can online dating grow on top of pandemic numbers as people continue to go out in person? The second issue is duplication. There\u2019s no reason to own tsm and intc, bmbl and mtch, cloudflare and crowdstrike, etc at the same time. Pick one and keep it moving. \n\nImo some of these names will come back in 5 years. Others won\u2019t. Therefore do a whittling down process to eliminate duplication, get rid of 1/2-2/3 of the portfolio, and keep ko and tsla."

Dollar-cost averaging that to a lower cost basis is going to take ages with little certainty for the future or reward. \n\nIf you really want to pick individual stocks some tips: check if companies actually make money, check if they are in a hype bubble (like AI now the new big thing is, but Blockchain had that spot a few years ago), and switch up your choices of industry. \n\nOr just yolo it all on 0DTE option gambles and become a prized member of the WSB wall of shame.\n\nAlso do your own research and don't follow what Reddit says too much."

A lot of other names recently have been making the similar structural moves higher like AMZN for example, and TSLA will likely follow. Longer term, who knows!"

  "Text": "b\"Here's a quick take on Tesla's Q4 results. $81.5B is the FY2022 revenue, a growth of 51.4% year over year from FY2021. The gross margin increased for the year from 25.3% to 26.2%. Net income increased 128% from $5.5B to $12.5B. Expect EBITDA to be at least $17.6B this year, an increase of 9% or so from FY2021.\\n\\nGiven these results, the valuations are as follows: the invested capital of Tesla is 5.1x LTM or FY2022 revenue -- remember, this multiple includes Tesla's huge cash balance of over $21b. The EBITDA multiple is about 25x while the earnings multiple (over market cap) is around 30.0x. Based on 2023E results, the earnings multiple should be around 26.0x. In other words, they're coming down like many growth companies that turn the corner and report positive earnings. Tesla was EBITDA positive starting in 2016 and earnings positive starting in 2020. The revenue growth year over year is 51.4% from FY2022. Plus these multiples would be somewhat lower if you took out the cash Tesla has:\"",

TSLA is obviously a very unique stock and has more retail participation than a lot of them. But we did about 100 analyses to try to explain the rally after the first split to the TSLA board and historically, there was no data to support the \"makes it easier for retail to participate\" point. And you would think there is even less of a chance this is true now with fractional shares. However, it does get the stock back into headlines, which can bring retail interest as people speculate whether it will lift the stock."

Pre-market tends to be more volatile due to significantly lower volume as most investors only trade between standard trading hours. TSLA has a roughly average overall score of 43 meaning the stock holds a better value than 43% of stocks at its current price. InvestorsObserver's overall ranking system is a comprehensive evaluation and considers both technical and fundamental factors when evaluating a stock. The overall score is a great starting point for investors that are beginning to evaluate a stock.

But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the companys share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?\\n\\nOne bright spot has been the companys increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivians future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% in'",

     "> Who the hell buys Tesla stock?\n\nGood investors. Why you ask?\n\n> Tesla is about to announce 2Q deliveries around 250K at best, most analysts have, with the usual delay (what is up with these 'professionals') dropped their expectations to 275K, with little idea what they are doing (there are some very good Tesla fanboi's out there with far better accuracy).\n\nSo, despite components shortages and reappearance of COVID in China they will have similar quarter to previous one?\n\n> Tesla has over 800,000 cars under investigation bythe NHTSA:\n\nAnd? NHTSA investigates various cars all the time, most often without finding any issues. Don't try to spread FUD.\n\nPlus, it's autopilot, if there is issue, it will be patched without any noticable cost for Tesla.\n\n> Its CEO has just declared Texas and Berlin (sic) are losing billions:\n\nNo he didn't. He said they are very capital intensive and that Tesla is spending bilions in very short time frame to build them rapidly. Which is normal when you build factories. Also, factories don't make money, products from them do.\n\n> 2 years after promises of robo-taxis that are dead\n\nHow is beta in hands of hundreds of thousands \"dead in the water\" with progress being made and visible every few months?\n\nSure, timeline slipped, but so it did for literally every single one autonomus cars company.\n\n> Cybertruck and the Tesla semi delayed time and time again, whilst Daimler, BYD and others already sell BEV semis' in US and other markets and Ford moving ahead with the electric F150:\n\nDaimler, BYD and rest are not production constrained and overflown with orders. Opening additional product lines (with rises operating costs) would only decrease profit for Tesla. Seriously, Tesla is so in demand that orders are so backlogged people buys used Teslas for more than new ones.\n\nAlso, so far, Tesla is only one actually making money on EVs.\n\n> Whilst Tesla is about to announce 250K deliveries for April, May and June, BYD announced 114,000 plug-ion sales in May alone, in locked down China\n\nHybrids are not EVs. Might as well compare Tesla to tractors.\n\n> Whilst Tesla remains the leader in Europe in terms of model sales in 2022 (in part because the other companies offer multiple EV's), it is only in third place by brand, by virtue of the underperformence of Hyundai and VW, who guess what, also have massive demand for EV's they cannot meet due to supply issues\n\nTesla has no operational factory in EU (yet). This comparison will only make sense when they do.\n\nWant fair comparison? Compare globaly.\n\n> The list of competitive and regulatory hurdles for Tesla goes on and on and on...\n\nWhat list of hurdles? The FUD above?"

     "A lot of this has come recently, I don't think this is long term. It seems Musk is just trying to push all the bad into this quarter and drop expectations. Next quarter they'll meet expectations, than start surpassing them again afterwards. With Shanghai being locked down due to COVID outbreak as well with Berlin and Texas just opening they're gonna be at pretty big lows for production which is their biggest problem. They're also throwing quite a bit of lay offs (from what I've heard it's been almost entirely management very few actual workers have been laid off). \n\nA lot of the announcements don't make much sense or just seem odd to announce at the time. It seems they're trying to just move all their upcoming bad stuff into this quarter so when they don't meet targets they can blame the recession. They take the time to fix the issues during the quarter and essentially use the recession to restructure for something more long term sustainable than the growth they've been pushing for the last decade. They meet expectations next quarter as they exit the restructuring phase. Then they start running afterwards and get back on track. \n\nTesla has a good mission and makes pretty nice cars while making a nice profit (good for shareholders). The main issue I've heard people take with Tesla's is either small errors in quality (panel gaps and stuff, they can take it to the local dealership/service center and it will get fixed under warranty), or issues with Musk himself (general doucheness and politics). One of the biggest issues with the stock itself in my opinion and opinion of many I know is the dividends, a lot of people like stocks with small dividend yields that still get good growth but have a bit of passive income to compound back onto their investments."

     "Recognized Innovation.\n\nI\u2019d love to see a study of how many Tesla customers also own Tesla stock.\n\nCuriosity. If Apple made a house, most people would be intrigued. If Hewlett Packard made a house, I think most people would be confused. \n\nReliability isn\u2019t the only selling point. I owned a Honda for 11 years, liked the reliability, and never once bought its stock. I dont own a Tesla now, but I have bought TSLA. I wasn\u2019t interested in the reliability of my Honda. I\u2019m interested in what a Tesla can do.\n\nBrand tribalism. History is replete with examples of \u201chype\u201d building recognition. Just look at IBM. Innovation may begin as hype, but we know that positive customer sentiment among recognized innovators (or designer brands) often commands higher prices and higher customer retention, which can be leveraged for product growth.\n\nProductization. When it becomes Tesla vs. Other Company, you realize there\u2019s a product future. Will you buy the Tesla motorcycle, Tesla drone, Tesla RV, Tesla Yacht, Tesla Jet Ski, Tesla Jet Pack\u2026 or the other?\n\nInnovative Distribution. A higher profit model doesn\u2019t always lead to competitive distribution. A culture of innovation can drive benefits in distribution. \n\nMultiple Winners. There wasn\u2019t just one winner among Microsoft, Apple, and HP. We know that markets have room for multiple players. Tesla co-exists.\n\nCompetitiveness. On the other hand, unrecognized innovation could just create higher R&D costs required to compete... \u201cSaturn had an electric vehicle, I think?\u201d\n\nSimply put, I recognize Tesla as the innovator in electric vehicles and associate it with what\u2019s coming next.

I want to try and advance humanity, and I think that\u2019s worth more to a lot of people than giving coca-cola another dollar.\u201d - Now I would argue that so far musk hasn\u2019t really \u201cdone\u201d anything to advance humanity. EVs existed before him, as did rockets, but things are moving quicker because of him, and I could see how it\u2019s possible in 10 years we are better off as a society with tesla around and money to spend on new ideas than not. So I\u2019m actually ok with tesla trading at a ridiculous multiple, it allows them to do more interesting things. It\u2019s a lot better than giving that multiple to coca-cola or JP Morgan, or Berkshire that\u2019s for sure. And I think cause of that, I\u2019ll just go buy a little tesla and join the party and hope they invent something really cool one day that changes our lives a lot for the better."

It will likely be just 13% of 2022 final global EV sales (and 18% of BEV's from 21% in 2021 and 23% in 2020).\\n\\nIts growth in sales has been impressive, but still below that of the broader EV market, be it by new entrants, or existing competitors.  Whilst Tesla dominates the US mkt still (albeit falling slightly recently) recent sales figures in China show 1 in 3 cars sold is a plug-in and 1 in 4 cars in Europe.  These are huge mkts, bigger than the US, that Tesla's rivals, be they legacy makers or newer EV entrants, have happily supplied with EV models, be they BEV's or hybrids.\\n\\nBYD taking over Tesla in EV sales in 2022 has been well reported, but Tesla remains in top spot in pure BEV's.

     "I believe the EV market captures 3% of all vehicles in the United States currently. Its projected to capture 30% by 2030. It will likely be a quicker transition to EVs then that. Tesla will inevitably lose market share to competition, especially if Elon continues to neglect his crown jewel of companies. I see Tesla as more of a energy company then a automobile company. Sure the autos will allow for scale but I\u2019m really interested in the ability of Tesla to innovate on its batteries, charger network, manufacturing, and AI. Combining these technologies will create for some very interesting synergies that can bring the world into a new age."

     "Pointless argument here. Your market share can decline but your total vehicle sales can increase. At the end of the day, Tesla was never going to be the sole EV seller in the world. That is why they are also focused on self-driving capabilities and have improved their supercharging network to offer ancillary benefits.\n\nTesla had near 100% market share a decade ago. Do you think they would rather be where they are a decade ago or today? Market share is more pronounce in a mature industry. When you're in the early stages, of course your market share will decrease."

     "For newcommers in stock market investments, the common recommendations is to start with a ETF - one large enough (Vanguard)  - check on your broker account if there is a core list with zero fees (I found it for me and I buy monthly with 25% of income on same ETF again and again).  One with dividend distribution is great, as you can reinvest the dividends now or to access the dividends. This is lower risk than picking stocks.\n\nI would study the idea to buy with mortgages. I know the interests are big now but are still smaller than inflation, and think there is the possibility to refinance once the interests are going down (I did this during the covid and I have a such a small interest). The idea is the rent to cover the mortgage and if you have any extra savings and no other idea what to do with money, pay faster the mortgage.  I have a few properties (smaller than you, far away smaller than you, my income is like 10% from Rentals but one day loans will finish one after the other ...) and my only regret is to not start using this tool earlier. You already have 100k in savings, you can use a part for a pay down and closing costs for a new home and add a mortgage now.  In the next year you can save another 100k and do it again etc.\n\nI know you are focused in rentals as you are good on it, but I would not totally dismiss the idea to invest in 401K + ROTH as are taxed deductible money - but postpone it. Until then read or maybe speak with a tax advisor, there are some tricks to access this money earlier without fees, learn how to  rollover from a 401(k) plan to Roth Ira, how much money from Roth you can access, how much taxes you will pay on the dividends, but definitely you have to split your saving monthly money into your a big Emergency Fund (as you have 4 big properties and things can go broken /vacancy / renovations between tenants) , the brokerage account, money for a new real estate and the pension plans.\n\nIn the meantime, read some books on how to pick a Company that match your vision: how to interpret the graphics of the stock price, to look at their vision and investments, understand the P/E, volatility, read their financial periodically reports, how much loans they have, exposure, their competitors etc etc -  and definitely build a  strategy, asset allocations, diversification of the portfolio in different industries, how much of portfolio to put in one stock, how much of portfolio to put in one industry, how much of portfolio to put in a country etc etc.  This takes time so I finally add to my portfolio   a new stock each 2-3 months."

They will make at least 15 billion in revenue this quarter alone.  For comparison, that is about half of what General motors makes with 88 factories versus Tesla checking in with 2.  2 factories made 15 billion.  Crazy."

Tax breaks, no red tape, apparently only limited exposure to Covid by his employees. \nIf I remember correctly, China refused to import any more teslas because of the camera security issues. \nI was just wondering, what had to be given up or not done that allows Elon to walk freely. \nI thought Alibaba had done quite well. Why wouldn\u2019t Elon be concerned of the same time off that jack ma was given. A forced vacation of sorts. \nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m an old guy. Just worried."

     "If the thesis is that Tesla is the future of the auto industry, then there's possibly some upside. But other auto makers are making significant improvements to their electric vehicle fleet like Ford, and Volkswagen. I'm still not sure how Tesla is being considered a software company, although they're probably the closest thing to automated driving out there now."
