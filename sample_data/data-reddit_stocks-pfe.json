However, earnings have been skyrocketing only over the last 2-3 years. Historically revenue, gross profit and operating income as well as net income has been either very volatile and pretty much flat since 2002-2005. \n\nI would argue that it's not cheap enough at the moment."

For some reason the market penalizes it for having had a Covid windfall; yeah the comparables won't look great, but that's a plus not a negative at today's near pre-Covid prices.\n\nThe only thing is I don't think Pfizer is going to prioritize the shareholder with its cash. Their management makes clear they want to acquire companies, which while good for future growth is bad for someone looking for share buybacks/dividends. The best bull case is a very anti-trust inclined federal government. Still, probably a decent boring investment to hold. Not sure if will outperform SPY though."

[+8% YoY]\n- The results came in above an analyst consensus of \u20ac1.17 billion. \n- Pretax profit was the highest since 2013. \n- Revenue rose 5%, including an increase of 35% in its corporate banking division.\n- The bank said deposits declined 4.7% in the quarter, driven by competition and market volatility at the end of the period.\n-  1% [in deposits] left the bank in the last two weeks of March, and by end-April deposits had risen again \n- A key liquidity ratio increased in the first three months of the year despite the stress faced by regional American lenders and Credit Suisse. The liquidity coverage ratio measures how many easy-to-sell assets a bank has versus its deposits, an important metric for banks that face deposit outflows. It stood at 143% in the first quarter, above the 100% minimum requirement. \n- The German lender said revenue at its corporate-banking and retail business rose 35% and 10%, respectively, in the first quarter. At its investment bank, it fell 19%\n- \u201cThings have stabilized in April essentially completely,\u201d he said, adding Deutsche Bank saw no counterparties doing business with it stepping away.\n\nSeems important given that we were dooming about Deutsche Bank a month ago."

     "**Intro:** I would like to share some interesting tweets about $AMR from one of the most prominent coal experts on Twitter, Bruce Morelan. If you would like to see future comments/posts and wish to be tagged on posts about $AMR, let me know. I may put them in a child/old comment/separate post to avoid clogging up the Daily threads. I promise I'm just trying to share DD, not shill. So far I only know /u/creemeeseason is interested in $AMR.\n\n*Disclaimer*: I'm going to edit all Tweets for clarity/grammar/conciseness (go to the Tweet to see original wording).\n\n[Tweet 1](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652356806319153152):\n\n> During June and July 2022, Aussie Met fell from $500 to $200 and AMR fell from $180 to $104.  The day of earnings, AMR was $126.  Adjusting for 15% share reduction, that would be $145. Current share price $146.  Earnings in a week so [on an adjusted basis] we are exactly where we were a year ago: Same market cap $2.2B, and same met price $200+.\n\n[Tweet 2:](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652347351967866883)\n\n> \n> $AMR at 2024 average metallurgical coal futures price of $270. Earnings of 16x[270-27-43-110] = $1.44B. [16M tons is the production figure, then he calculates revenue - production costs]\n> -$240M o/h - $240M tax = $960M/13M = $74 EPS. \n\nThis is a 1.97 P/E ratio on 2024 earnings using today's futures pricing for met--and met has been falling pretty hard recently. And no shares repurchased. O/H is... overhead?\n\n[Tweet 3.](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652035970370527232) As he states in another thread, this assumes NO shares repurchased.\n\nHe projects for 2023:\n\n- $BTU: $1.70 + $2.00 + $1.50 + $2.80 = $8 EPS [forward 3.0 P/E]\n- $ARCH $10 + $6 + $6 + $12 = $24 EPS [3.6 forward P/E]\n- $AMR: $17 + $11 + $11 + $19 = $58 EPS [2.5 forward P/E]\n\n[Tweet 4](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1647238028283478021): As he pointed out in his 'bull case,' if Met falls for 3 years (280, 240, then 200 average), and then we consider 3 scenarios for 2026: $180 met (103% upside), $250 met (202% upside), and $320 met (314% upside).\n\n[Tweet 5](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1647245289068331010) continuation: If Met *doesn't* fall for 3 years  (Stays at 280), the 3 listed scenarios for 2026 become +144%, +272%, +393%.\n\n[Tweet 6](https://twitter.com/tradedollarnut/status/1652335223877828610): In his extreme downside scenario ($22 EPS for AMR), we're trading at 6.5x earnings. He think we get 2.6x  that EPS in 2023 ($58).\n\nBruce's estimates are pretty good generally. He called the weak BTU earnings for Q1 despite being one of the biggest bulls on Twitter about it. He also called the much stronger Q4 earnings that analysts were much much more pessimistic about. He grew a bit bearish about AMR recently thanks to falling met, but we'll see how that shapes up. Coal Twitter is predicting a very strong $AMR quarter."

     "My conclusions after making another post that made it to the top of /r/stocks, along with conclusions from past posts I have made (I actually have quite a few in this sub). It is a mixture of observations and notes to self and even recommendations to others if you are someone that dislikes arguing with people on the Internet:\n\n- Responding to everyone is exhausting. Better to simply stop replying / disable inbox notifications (when you see someone say something you think is wrong and go to the top, it's tempting to always want to respond)--let others do the work for you.\n- You attract a lot more toxicity than in the Daily Discussion thread due to the higher number of people commenting. \n- A very diverse selection of responses that include:\n    - Conspiracy theorists (everything is manipulated by the Big Guys)\n    - Retail vs. Institution Class Warriors (every aspect of the stock market is designed to suppress us from rising up)\n    - Mr. I have an Anecdote that disagrees with your data\n    - Guy who gets angry that your post has an agenda (even before you posted any opinions and simply copy/pasted an article)\n    - High quality push back from very knowledgeable commenters that I very much value (please continue)\n    - The person who ties politics into every post\n    - Person who doesn't really follow the stock market and is just very confused but tries to learn\n- Never directly state things are looking up or good unless you wish to anger the hornets nest and obtain angry responses from people whose worldview is centered on being aggrieved about something. It also comes across as tone-deaf.  It doesn't matter how good or bad the economy or stock market--they will *never* be happy, and arguing with them will never make you look good.\n- Instead, when it comes to positive developments, sound as neutral as possible. Frame things as a question rather than an assertion. No need for neutrality when talking about negative developments. \n- If you enjoy arguments, disregard the previous two points.\n\nAnd finally, a word of appreciation to the Daily Discussion bros and gals: Ignoring the noise/trolls, there is a lot of high quality discussion every now and then, and pleasant exchanges to be had. I shall continue poasting data/graphs, glorifying coal stocks, and linking to Unhedged columns from the FT. And I may even post more memes of PutsRNotDaWae arguing with SeanK11 and InternationalTop2405."

The merger is all cash and concerns about anti-trust regulation seem to have been quelled by recent divestments. There is a huge multibillion dollar penalty if it were to not go through, so it seems good motivation to get it done. Shareholders still have to approve, but seeing as it was bought at quite a premium, I can't imagine that will be an issue. The biotech realm may be a little spooked about regulation blowing deals up, as was done with Illumina's acquisition of Grail, but this feels more solid. Many ADC companies in the same space are being snapped up, so I would expect this will go through. Money isn't cheap anymore and likely isn't getting cheaper, so I could see how this may not be as attractive a play as other parts of the market for a longer hold.

You also have to consider that in order for them to maintain profitability they have to constantly invest in brand name drugs which is very expensive and does not guarantee a blockbuster hit like viagra for example. They also are in direct competition with generic drug companies. There is also potential risk with regulation in the future which is a REAL risk. As such 11pe 4.5% dividend yield sounds fairly valued to me from just a broad view glance.\n\nBut yea, considering in this market everything is overpriced fairly valued is undervalued."

Over the past two weeks, they've closed negative almost every day. But as we approach earning, their volatility has decreased, and indicators suggest what seems to be a soon increase in price. I plan on purchasing a call option with a strike price of 35$ with an expiration of 2/12. EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.48. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $0.55. Despite this, I believe that because of the massive amounts of vaccinations ordered by countries worldwide, they will crush last year's earnings. Please supply me with feedback. This is my first time trading with options. I've tried to do my homework but I'm sure there are still things that I don't know and Id greatly appreciate the feedback.:)\\n\\nEdit: 2/12 in Title\"",

BUT they are correctly valued for today.  They trick is the value in the future and no one knows 100%.  It is easy to picture a company returning to its 1 or two year high (many are 50, 60 or more % off).  Two months ago I would have said SWK and VFC were my two favorites.  GSK has a P/E of 4.  INTC seems pretty cheap.  MMM is cheap but maybe for a reason (litigation) -- but I have still bought it.  Bottom line I guess is be careful about looking at 2 to 5 year charts and assuming a stock will get back to where it way.  Just go back to 2000 and see how long it took the NASDAQ to recover.  It will again, but how long?  I owned MSFT and Oracle back then but gave up on them after a few years.... Mistake!  Best of luck."

Whats on your watchlist?\\n\\nMy recent buys are: INTC, ZAL, GOOG, META, SONO, WBD, ILMN.\\n\\nSome stocks that Im most interested in picking up in the near future (looking for a final leg down): AMD, NVDA, BABA, TCEHY.

     "A deal isn't a deal when the price is still dropping.  There is no reason to buy into something right now.  It's not like you're going to \"miss out\" if you wait for the market and these stocks to truly settle.\n\nI took a look at every single one of those stocks.  Not one is a good buy right now.  They will be good buys, certainly, but every single one is dropping, some worse than others.\n\nWait, there's one that sort of ok, GILD.  You might be okish with LOW too.  \n\nI'm also a fan of NFLX. I think a deliberate bad marketing ploy pushed their prices down to stupidly low levels.  Their metrics are rock solid and among the best they've ever been at.  Despite this, they're priced like it's 2017 which is nuts.  I honestly expected them to recover fast.  Surprisingly, the marketing seemed to work, and they've stayed unusually low.  I made a little on their initial ramp back up, but they stagnated.  Long term, they're still a solid bet.  When you actually compare them against every other streaming service, they are basically a titan in comparison, not just in raw subscriptions, but their growth has constantly been better.  They should have been back up to $600 by June, frankly.  I'm expecting their October financials to be well above estimates.\n\nI don't mind deals.  There's a lot of stuff that are deals.  I just think most of these will see better sales.  Nearly everything you mentioned is still going down and there is neither confidence nor investment momentum in any of them.  The only outlier looks to be GILD, but that's it.\n\nThere's a few things that are green right now and that will make you money right now.  But a lot of what's paying out right now is Bear indexes/ETFs.  You're betting against nations, real estate, various markets, or commodities like gold (which oddly should be good in a down trend...but isn't right now).  Think YANG, DRV, DUST, or EDZ.  Yeah, it's not long term buys, but this is a garbage market, and if you're looking to make or keep money, you're betting right for garbage.  For example YANG made 86% over the last 3 months.  Sure, going bear on China is kind of a sucky thing to think about, but this is the kind of stuff that's paying out right now.  When the recession hit late last December, it was oil paying out.  While the market tanked, you could have bet into oil and made 2x to 4x over just a few months.  At that time, that was about the only thing green.  Right now, green is betting on failure.  It's definitely a bear market, and (some) leveraged bears are making serious cash.\n\nBut if you want safe and stagnant, you can easily just shove your cash in SPY or any equivalent, and it will sit flat for a good while.  This was a reasonable choice to ride the down trend early in the year.  You didn't really lose all that much versus a lot of other choices.  And it's still a good buy to just sit on and forget for 20 years.\n\nAs for single companies, I tend to favor someone that's changing the world as we know it.  There's not a lot out there that I look at and think \"wow, they're really doing something amazing and pioneering the next decade, the next century.\"  Tesla's about the only one that stands out to me.  People want to say that it's overpriced still, but there really aren't many companies comparable.  However, it's a stock that's dead flat right now.  I'm also curious how hard other automakers are going to encroach into the EV space.  Tesla's kind of had the luxury of being solo in the space for about a decade.  That's going away.  But the company is well run, and they're the only company self producing batteries and have enough batteries to actually build their cars.  No other automaker is doing this.  Others can make EVs, but battery production for them is limited.  Plus very few are in the market at any real volume outside of a couple brands like Ford are pushing real volume numbers into this space.  While Tesla's producing a million cars, brands like Rivian are targeting like 15,000.  There is no comparison to the shear volume Tesla has in that space.  They simply dominate it.  And it's not just cars."

A relatively  stable stock to see me through relatively unstable times.\n\n\\- Facebook: the cool kids prefer TikTok, but I expect they will grow out of it, start wearing cardigans, and turn to Facebook just like the \"OK, Boomer!\" crowd they mock. Plus, the company is a money fountain.\n\n\\- GOOGLE: probably the most solid FAANG company, but shockwaves from Netflix and the Fed ripped into an insane discount yesterday: so I loaded up\n\n\\- A Vanguard Whole Market Index ETF: because this should be the basis of any portfolio in an emerging bear market: sure, you take all the hits, but you also take all the gains, as money flies around through the rollercoaster ride.\n\n\\- Alibaba: the most discounted stock I own. Probably a bigger risk than anything else in my portfolio, but I don't have paper hands, so am willing to see this rise or fall long term."

RIP calls \n\nPuts and calls on Tesla.  We're trading around the midpoint of the bull flag.  Could go to top or bottom resistance lines.  Top resistance is break even.  Breaking top is $.  Bottom is $$$$.\n\nPuts on AMZN, sold at Friday close, may grab one next week in hopes for a disastrous earnings report on Thursday.\n\nPuts on ENPH, sold most of them Friday.  Could go lower, just trying to simplify my portfolio and see what the market is doing next week after such a huge drop.\n\nLong term calls on TTWO, mid term puts.  I mean, GTA VI...  Been waiting for a major pullback for awhile.  Love this gaming company.  We're on the bottom diagonal resistance line.  Could break it next week,or could retrace back up.  Hoping we see a short term breakdown and big bounce by September.\n\nMid term Calls on NFLX after it tanked...big bet...but added some short term puts just in case.  Probably should have added short term puts earlier, already lost half on this one because of that.  A bounce to 300 would be interesting for my portfolio.\n\nLong term calls on AMRS, because ya neva know.  Probably a dumb bet tbh.\n\nPuts on AMD, sold Friday.\n\nPuts and Calls on BITO.  There is a case for BTC dropping to 20000-23000 before running back up to all time highs.  The short term calls are to play the bear flag band... We're at the bottom resistance line.  Long term puts if the bear flag confirms.  I'll be buying all the calls if the bear flag confirms down to 23000.\n\nI'm a SPY buyer if S&P drops to 3900-4000 and begins consolidating against strong resistance to the downside.  4300 was where I expected a bounce if we were confirming a reverse head and shoulders, but it broke through that and I had already taken profits on most of my puts.  Blah.  If it gets to lower bull flag resistance line at 3900-4000, I'll be big on calls with a put for protection.  There is a weak case for S&P breaking the lower bull flag resistance and dropping back 3600.  Not a high chance, but it's there.\n\nOnce it bottoms, I'm hoping to see another run up to all time highs, before we move into recession / bear market either late this year or early next year."

And 6x more than tesla and tesla has been on the list for a year.  It only targets short low quality posts & comments.\n\n**update3** c'mon, it's not that bad, at least I removed amc, nok, bb, and a bunch of other stocks off the meme list since barely no one talks about them anylonger :D"

When you have emerging tech like 3D printing or hydrogen engines that technology already exists. Sure maybe its primitive and it sucks in its current state and its not economically viable right now, nonetheless it does exist. MV does not exist right now and it's supposed to be the next big thing for FB. It's a bit iffy to say the least.\n\nAnyway, if you have read the MV manifesto you will know that MV is not VR, it's not AR, it's not living in a video game. That's like saying that my iPhone is the Internet. Ok, so the thing about MV is that it's completely open and interoperable platform. So how will that square up with FB's goal to make MV into a walled garden? It just cannot be by definition. There cannot be \"Facebook's MV\" like there cannot be \"Google Internet\". Internet is internet, if one website is polluted by annoying immutable ads you will leave that website and go to another one. But (and I've just checked this) FB revenue is 98% advertising and 2% other. So how will FB monetise this MV? People will simply flee away if is littered by BS ads. Well maybe they hope that if they build the first big MV platform people will stick around even if it sucks (just like Facebook...) I suppose if they are first to the game and they get the network effect going then maybe. Still that's a big IF.\n\nIve spend some time figuring out what MV really is supposed to be and I just cannot see how FB will win in it."

With fundamental analysis you could find stocks that could not make money with the oil price but had cash to survive many years.

The same fundamentals can produce vastly different market reactions based on overall sentiment, influenced by politics, natural catastrophes or even just big sports events. \n\nBottom line: Fundamentals do most of the time set \"boundaries\" for price movements and p/e-ranges relative to a given general sentiment.

Any ticker symbols in particular that you have loaded up from these recent dips?\\n\\nHere are my thoughts:\\n\\nI am hoping that NVDA continues its growth next year as its online services and the metaverse gain traction. AMD too obviously from their recent partnership with Tesla and Meta. Both of these companies had an amazing year that I believe will continue their growth for the next few years at least.\\n\\nSoFi and IONQ are also two stocks that I believe will be good bets for 2022, especially as the BC gets approved for SoFi. IONQ has strong fundaments and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\\n\\nIm also DCAing into Paypal, as I believe that it just got hammered this year. In 2022, venmo, owned by paypal, is coming to amazon which is exciting news!\\n\\nWhat are your thought'",

Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.

     "Problem is the market crash was due to the reaction to covid, not the disease itself. Market won't crash cause you are sick. It crashes cause the business shut down after the government made them. The U.S. has too many vaccinations now for the government to react to covid with a shutdown. Biden already said there will be no more lockdowns. Not that he's in charge of it, but the main reason they did so easily before was to get rid of fat guy. There's about no chance they shutdown anything now that they are in power. Just like the country didn't shutdown under Obama with H1N1 with 61 million infected and 274,000 hospitalizations. Anyway, if covid comes back it will mostly impact other countries that don't have the vaccines and protections in place. This might hurt the world economy, but problem is when there is a world crisis the money will flow into the United States market as a safe haven. No, the risk to the market is actually after covid goes away and things return to normal. Covid is and has always propped up the market to new highs. The only thing that hurt the market was forced business shutdown which causes a liquidity crisis cause businesses had their reserve capital in corporate bonds which they couldn't sell to anyone during a panic. That's why the Fed has to step in to be the buyer. That's why currently we are in a \"Goldilocks\" environment, cause we are right in in-between covid reduction and reopening. So you get the best of both worlds, massive spending from covid stimulus spending and companies open for business. It's basically a planned economy with massive central bank spending that guarantees an outcome. Once covid is gone and stimulus is gone, whenever or if ever, then the market will be in some hurt."

     "OP, I respect this analysis a lot since it has been on my mind for quite some time.  \n\n\nHowever, instead of completely pulling out of the market. I invest in assets that will thrive in volatile market and some even have crash insurance such as NUSI. If you worry about a crash, you might want to look into these assets: NUSI, ETJ, SWAN, ISWN, etc... These assets won't go up as fast as SP500 but they allows you to participate partially in the upside and protect you against the downside. That's to me is win-win.  \n\n\nI also started diversifying International as much as possible. I noticed that recently International has a drop so good chance to buy in. Crisis normally hits other countries first before it comes crashing down our shores. US situation right now is similar to a kid stuffing toys down the toilet and once something is stuck, all the shits gonna come out and you gonna get owned.  \n\n\nHowever, with some skepticism, I still recommend to hedge your bets and stay invested rather than completely pull out. The reason why pulling out might be even more foolish is because of all these money printing and trillion dollars of stimulus causing your money to lose value faster than you think.  \n\n\nThere are also nothing else to invest in, let's see:  \n\n\nCash: worthless  \n\n\nReal Estates: an even bigger bubble than the stock market  \n\n\nVirtual Currency: look into tether scandal, it gonna blow up this speculative market  \n\n\nGold & Silver: the price movements look heavily manipulated. Inflation shoots through the roof and price of these metals go down or flat  \n\n\nBond: with 0.00001% interest rate ? Fuck that  \n\n\nThe only thing left is stock market.

It's being allowed to circulate in some countries with vaccination (UK, US, EU) which means it will be continually probing and prodding at people with vaccines till it finds a way round.\n\nThis nightmare may go on for years and years.

     "Here is some research I have compiled.\n\n- Pfizer is working not only on more mRNA treatments, but many other kinds. You can see here the number of Phase 3 trials [in their pipeline document](https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/product-pipeline/Pipeline_Update_08FEB2022.pdf?1LyL7HgKeLza5jVNXvCDNKZhykNz2IGT). They have between 25-30 drugs in each of the Phases (1, 2, and 3), and then 10 in the final 'registration' step. This adds up to a total of 89 drugs in some type of late stage clinical trial. Merck has about 30 drugs as well in Phase 3, but a much larger 79 in Phase 2. But Merck also didn't successfully benefit from Covid-19 like Pfizer. Both have similar P/E ratios.\n- Their P/E ratio is extremely cheap: 7.7 trailing, 12 forward; the sector median is 21.\n- They are constantly coming up with new collaborations, like using genetic editing to treat diseases. For example, there is a recent collaboration with BEAM pharmaceuticals [(Source)](https://www.biospace.com/article/pfizer-triple-partners-for-future-mrna-vaccines-and-genetic-medicines-/). Moreover, \"PFE has bolstered its pipeline by multiple acquisitions such as Arena Pharmaceuticals, Array BioPharma, Therachon, and Trillium Therapeutics Inc since 2019.\" Source: a SA link I cannot post.\n- Free Cash Flow (FCF) is substantial, yielding more money to spend in R&D, share buybacks, dividends, and investments. \"Sales of its COVID-19 vaccine have provided a windfall of cash for Pfizer over the past 12 months. In 2020 and 2019, the healthcare giant accumulated $11.6 billion and $10 billion in free cash flow, respectively. But over the past four quarters, its free cash flow surged to $29.2 billion.\"  The FCF figure of 29.2 billion is a third of Apple's FCF of 93 billion, for comparison. [Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/12/3-growth-stocks-that-have-generated-179-billion-in/)\n- Moderna, by comparison: \"Moderna had 14 non-Covid drugs in its pipeline as of a few months ago, one of which is late-stage. Pfizer has 100, 25 of which are late stage. Moderna is too Covid-dependent.\" [This is quoting a comment I made a long time ago, but I don't remember where I sourced that statistic.]\n\nMy takeaways are: It's a very cheap stock; there is a lot more to it than Covid, although it will continue to reap benefits from it; it has tons of cash to spend; Covid demonstrated their innovative ability, not to mention their past history of success.\n\nRisk: they seem to have a patent cliff in 2024, but their robust pipeline makes this less worrisome. Also, mRNA vaccines may not be successful, since I believe a fundamental problem with this type of technology is poor longevity, compared to traditional DNA vaccines. [I need to recheck this again.]"

     ">Do you think Pfizer is undervalued right now due to incorrect interpretation of future vaccine and anti-viral drug sale projections?\n\nI believe Pfizer is trading at a very slight premium due to an incorrect interpretation from the market of COVID related sales going into late 2022 and, more importantly, 2023-2025. I expect such a revenue to actually taper off, not grow, sharply.\n\n>More a more general level, do you think Pfizer is going to wisely invest its covid windfall and develop great revenue streams?\n\nI think Pfizer already has invested some of the COVID related profits wisely, though they remain behind the industry average for R&D investments if I'm remembering right. Pfizer sports 89 products on their pipeline, ten of which in the process of being registered (5 COVID related).\n\n>Do you consider Pfizer a great buy or not? Is this a long term hold? The pe ratio is 13. Is that considered normal for drug companies?\n\n1. I think, despite saying earlier it's trading at a premium, it's still a decent *investment.* I'd wait before pulling the trigger though.\n2. Yes, Pfzier is a long term hold. Aside from sporting a healthy dividend TTM 3.04% yield (39.69% payout ratio), which is already attractive to me, Pfizer has a substantial stable moat in the Healthcare space. A diversified product catalogue and no patents expiring till 2028 (Eliquis comes to mind) alongside a strong distribution network all help to keep it's pricing power for drugs in the company's favor.\n3. Pfizer's p/e ratio of 15.83 (where did you get 13?) is fairly competitive with other companies in the industry. Similar to other companies like $NVS and $MRK that I'd recommend to others for due diligence research."

Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines result in far fewer serious symptoms of infection (i.e. reduced need for this drug). Other drugs are currently available to help suppress the cytokine storm. OP doesn't mention any of this. Is there big upside? Possibly. Is it already factored into share price? Probably to some extent but I doubt there's 5x-10x upside.

     "Right on. You can think that CRISPR is gonna cure all ailments and diseases in 15 years (which is an ambitious claim - if something sounds like science fiction the reality is often much much more nuanced and has a long way to go), but even if that was true, that doesn\u2019t mean the small companies looking into it now will be around forever. Biotech companies are notoriously difficult to start, don\u2019t return profits for a long time, and are dependent on the FDA, and I\u2019m sure the owners are just hoping to sell to Merck, Pfiszer, etc. once the time is right. Trying to commercialize something that is intrinsically out of your control and left to nature (scientific results) is extremely stressful cause you can do everything completely right for 2 decades and wind up with absolutely nothing. If I started a company like that and it wound up becoming profitable, I wouldn\u2019t start calling myself the new Bill Gates and stick with it. I\u2019d sell to the highest bidder ASAP.\n\nAlso love what you said about TMO. If there is one constant in my life as a graduate researcher, it is absolutely Thermo Fisher. If there is an option to buy something with Thermo, I will, even if it\u2019s 50% more expensive. Their partnerships with research institutions like mine just make it easier to order from them than from competitors. Don\u2019t even need to use a purchasing card - it\u2019s all in the system. And they sell almost everything. They\u2019re not going anywhere and if biotech grows, a small biotech company might not, but Thermo sure will. Cause almost every single item that went into conducting every experiment was probably purchased through Thermo or Sigma. And they are the masters of upchargjng for items, but have a customer base that cares less about being upcharged because \u201cthat\u2019s just how it is in science.\u201d"

     "You're hugely simplifying the supply chain side of things. VWR and Fisher (owned by TMO) are the most commonly used catalog services for consumables, but that doesn't mean they make all of them. Corning and BD, as well as brands owned by Thermo like Pyrex and Nalgene, are big in lab plastics and glassware. For chemicals, in addition to Fisher and J.T. Baker (owned by TMO and AVTR respectively), MilliporeSigma (Merck KGaA outside the US) is huge and there are a lot of smaller brands. For things like gloves and paper products, it's mostly KimTech (a Kimberly-Clark brand). For more specialized things there's always a variety of providers. Eppendorf is synonymous with microcentrifuge tubes. Cytiva (Danaher), MiliporeSigma, and BioRad are big providers of chromatography resins and Repligen has kind of cornered the market on prepacked columns. Filters vary based on types with the workhorse ones mostly provided by MilliporeSigma or Sartorius in my experience. I've mostly seen depth filters from 3M, viral filters from MilliporeSigma or Asahi Kasei, and TFF filters from Pall (also Danaher).  \n\nI'd also say that you're simplifying the equipment space, particularly downplaying how big Danaher is (especially since the Cytiva acquisition). Mettler Toledo definitely deserves a mention for scales, pipets (Rainin is one of their brands), and pH meters. Sartorius also makes equipment of larger scale for manufacturing. There's also a ton of more niche equipment made by more specialized brands."

     "I did some of my own DD. This is posted in other threads but here..\n\nEUA expected in 1-4 weeks. Shorts are trying to silence this company. Please do your own DD. I\u2019ve been following this company for 6 months and I am in it for the long haul. \n\nthis drug is immune to mutations of COVID-19, simply because it does not target COVID-19. This \u201cin the weeds\u201d company is called Humanigen and their therapeutic drug is called Lenzilumab.\n \nLenzilumab, with other treatments including steroids and/or remdesivir, help prevent and treat an immune hyper-response, (cytokine storm). GM-CSF is responsible for activating macrophages and monocytes that contribute to disease severity, Mapping Severe COVID-19 in the Lungs at Single-Cell Resolution \u2013 NIH Director's Blog .[mapping severe covid](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/04/13/mapping-severe-covid-19-in-the-lungs-at-single-cell-resolution/)\n \nFully administered in one day, Lenzilumab improves patient SpO2 levels within the first 24 hours as shown by mayo clinic study and can prevent progression to invasive mandatory ventilation by 54%. It helps get patients out of the ICU/ hospital sooner, making more room for other critical patients in need. Humanigen Inc. - Humanigen Reports Positive Phase 3 Topline Results Demonstrating That Lenzilumab\u2122 Improves Survival Without Need for Mechanical Ventilation in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19[phase 3 results](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2021/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Phase-3Topline-Results-Demonstrating-That-Lenzilumab-Improves-Survival-Without-Need-for-Mechanical-Ventilation-in-Hospitalized-Patients-With-COVID-19/default.aspx)\n \nOne item that may be a concern is the cost of the drug. However, the need for mechanical ventilation significantly increases the costs of COVID-19 care, as well as having a prolonged stay in the ICU. I\u2019m not sure on Canada\u2019s numbers in our healthcare, but in the States, it\u2019s 5x the cost Mechanical Ventilation Adds 5X the Cost to COVID-19 Care | Premier (premierinc.com)[5x cost ](https://www.premierinc.com/newsroom/blog/mechanical-ventilation-adds-5x-the-cost-to-covid-19-care)\n \nThe FDA has revoked EUA for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab because of its ineffectiveness against newer strains while being used for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms , FDA Revokes Emergency Use Authorization for Monoclonal Antibody Bamlanivimab (govdelivery.com)[bam is bad](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/bulletins/2cd68e3)\n\nOf the currently available vaccines with mutations on the rise and reduced efficacy against them, I believe that Lenzilumab can help save lives and solve multiple problems that we are currently facing. Such as, reduce need for invasive mandatory ventilation, immune to mutant strains, reduce hospital stay ie. More bed availability, fast reoxygenation response, fully administered in 1 day, cost savings on healthcare, etc. I want to put eyes on this because it seems that it\u2019s getting silenced from HF shorts. So much amazing news. \n\nAgain please do your own DD but I think this is a diamond in the rough."

The more complicated one is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model which adds up all the company's future earnings based on various assumptions and compares to what the market prices the company at today based on the stock price.\n\nA simpler, more approachable model you could use for your assignment is the Dividend Growth model - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp\n\nYou could also compare various valuation metrics of PFE (the P/E ratio, Price/Sales, etc) against other companies in its industry and use that to make an argument that its over or undervalued."

     "The below is an almost first copy pasta from my last comment, edited slightly to assist for your particulars\n\nWrong allocation. Check the ETF holdings and you'll see they cross hold many of the same names already so why punt on them again individually? Try some Real Estate is another good asset allocation choice. \n\nThink of David Swensen and his key lessons:\n\n1/ asset allocation\n\n2/ security selection\n\n3/ market timing\n\nSo, you're young and want to be mostly in equities. Fine, but think of 1/ above, so pick some long dated inflation protected bond ETF (for example) and tuck 10% there\n\nDiversification brings benefits, but it has to be meaningful, so if you want that real estate ETF make it 10% too\n\nSo now you know you're going to be 80% equities. But always? Perhaps some years (some big life events make you more conservative) you will lower that target allocation by X% and allocate it to other assets you discover: private equity, high yield credits, etc. Or to your bond and/or real estate allocation on a permanent basis. \n\nThe market timing of the advice from Swensen will be taken care of by saying to yourself at each annual rebalance, when you reduce equities to the new target (80 - X next year), \"are equities over valued\" and if the easy answer is yes you simply rebalance so the target is missed by 5% and you put half of the dollar value in bonds and half in real estate over and above what you had to do to bring them to 10% each\n\nNow for security selecting... the 2/ above. There are so many interesting ETFs that deal with the problems the S&P 500 has which are almost as cheap as Vanguard's flagships. You can find one that looks at value with momentum overlay in emerging markets. There are ones that go long/ short. Basically you can easily target some key factors: small size, high growth, high quality, high value. You pick funds that give you access to that globally, you'll be doing okay. Look at ETF screening websites for ideas.\n\nAnd you want to punt on names? Take half your dividend each year and have a punt. Break it up into 12 parts and pick a name (pick a guru to follow, but a system to trade with, do your own DCF on some screener output) or an option or an altcoin or a future on a commodity or a currency each month and have a dabble. And if you have fun and do well perhaps parlay those profits into something more in that field. And if you lose, think of it as play money. The rest of the dividends, plug back in to the portfolio at the next rebalance\n\nDM me if you need more of a walk through"

It will all be tax free (except when extreme leftists come into power and take away all your money).\n\nYou could have more than that if you can grow your money faster. You can have a fancy car now, or a decent used car and more contributions to the Roth IRA.\n\nGood start. I am hoping my son will be able to see your wisdom."

     "Well you're doing it all wrong IN MY OPINON (not financial advice fyck you SEC)\n\n1) Lease a car or buy under $4k (probably $5k now after inflation). Buying a car is the biggest waste of money you'll ever make. Always add debt before using capital. That's the best motto in life. Doesn't mean go consume all your income on credit card interest. But leverage the shjt out of your income. It's harder to save than it is to make payments.\n\n2) Putting money into any kind of investment account is a waste. Only do it if you're set on never investing. Investing implies active management whether you're trading or investing in the literal sense. If you're no good at it, sure, create an IRA and throw money into that black hole and forget about it.\n\n3) Too many funds, not enough concentration. Pick 3 stocks/ETFs you like and focus on those. Probably something like: FNILX, TSLA, swap AAPL for a bank (JPM, BAC, GS) and then consolidate all the rest into those.\n\nThat would put you on a much stronger footing than where you're currently at.\n\nYou then manage those 3 positions as you branch into opportunities, treating those 3 positions as a kind of keel or ballast to your ship at sea."

I have always invested in hyper growth/growth companies with a good business. It always worked until it did not. I have only been in the market 4-5 years and I am never experienced current macro environment. I ended up buying dips on my holding which dipped another 30-40 percent and it devastated my portfolio. I started the year around 225k now I am down to 60k. I am still holding some companies I truly believe in but realized losses to free some cash.\\n\\nNow I am looking to pick some stocks that suits current macro environment and can offer some upsides. I am starting to look at some low valuation companies. So far I like some bio tech companies i.e. MRK PFE CCXI & other stocks like VALE VIAC. What will be your suggestion? Thank you'",

     "Based on your post I think you need a lot more consideration then hopping on the next hot thing. Losing 75% of the value of your investment means either you need to just hold strong through a dip in growth stocks (assuming your picks are strong and this is the nature of high growth), or you need a new strategy. \n\nI would take a serious look at your current portfolio before just sinking more in. \n\nWith that said I think if you like growth and have a high risk tolerance this is actually a great year to get into clean energy"

     "Just the list you posted there says a lot about your current holdings. In short, you\u2019re trying too hard. I would die to have 225k disposable money. Anyway, to your question: when inflation goes up, some business are able to forward the cost and the consumer purchases regardless as it is a necessity. When people have to scale back spending, they can scale back on everything except food, inexpensive clothing and housing/roof over their head. So companies that make necessities will weather the storm. PG JNJ are good ones. Banks also tend to do well because of short term lending. Some health care also does well, but more like UNH than biotech. Search for inflation resistance stocks and you\u2019ll get a few good lists. Aim to create a dividend portfolio first. You have a lot of money it seems like and loosing it, shouldn\u2019t be your goal. Most companies that are goods based also give decent dividends."

     "Hi fellow eurobro, Italian living in Norway here!\n\nFrom what I read, you've little confidence in many of your picks, which is not a good sign. Do you know what Crayon does? Do you know 70% of their business is from a single client? (Microsoft, which is good, but still a single client). To know everything about a company you own will increase conviction and will be easy to stick with it in downturns. \n\nIf you're a beginner, I would advise you to invest first in ETF such as VOO, VTI, QQQ or even SMH if you know the Semiconductors market. There are EU alternatives as well to those ones. I would allocate 90% to ETF, and 10% to stock picking while learning. In the meantime learn how to evaluate a company, to read financial statements or at the very least the concepts of PE, PS, PB, PEG, cash flow etc. Once you get more skilled in picking stocks, I'd increase my single stock %.\n\nAlways keep something like 15% cash for good opportunities like last month. By studying and identifying the company you like you'll be ready when everyone panics to buy them at a discount, because you've done your homework before.\n\nAnd remember that 99% of traders don't beat the market. Index investing and dollar cost averaging is boring but it works, especially because it removes the worst enemies of an investor: fear, greed and emotions in general."

     "\\-Is your portfolio messed up?  \nNo it's better than 90% of the portfolios you see here, at least you thought a little about why you bought what and didn't just go 100% US-Tech. That said I wouldn't recommend buying something just because \"people are talking about it\" that isn't a good strategy. If yo ain't 100% confident in your stock picks, you might also want to include some index funds. You could do something like 20% Total US market, 20 developed markets, ex US, 20% emerging market and 40% individual stocks. you can also do a 30/30/30/10 split and just follow two stocks closely, to really learn what it's like to invest in individual stocks.\n\n\\-Is it okay to discuss EU stocks  \nYes. We have a lot of people from the US here, and US stocks have done great in the past, so naturally, you get a lot of people thinking that US stocks are the only stocks that make sense to invest in, which is false. People also somehow got the idea that \"they know US stocks better\" something I can't exclude, but I highly doubt they know them better than any other stocks, at least to any meaningful extent. That said accounting regulation differs between countries, and you need to be aware of this if you invest in individual stocks around the world.\n\n\\-Are prices too high?  \nToo high? I don' know, but prices are very high, which has a negative impact on future returns.  \nTo quote every financial article ever written. \"If things go well stocks might go up, but if things go poorly they might also go down\"  \nIn any case, it's better to be invested than not. If you are very worried and are sitting on a lump sum, you can divide that sum by 12, and invest it over 12 months.\n\n\\-How did I get started.  \nYoutube inspired me at first.  \nI would start by watching the lectures Aswath Damodaran got on his channel. That should get you started with the basics. When you're done with that I can provide you with a reading list if you are interested.\n\n\\-Have you ever doubted your trades  \nYes I think that's true for everyone. Back in September when the market was setting all-time highs I was down 16% for the year. I was not happy. Today I am up 24% vs the markets 22% since 01/012020. every single person that invests in individual stocks will have periods of underperformance, in some cases, they will underperform massively.  \nFor me two things really help. The first is just knowing what you are doing. If you know the companies you are buying are solid, you know it's stupid to sell when they are down. In fact doing anything other than buying more would be stupid. After all, if the price is down 16%, but the fundamentals are the same, my return must be 16% higher now..  \nAnother trick I use is to only look at my portfolio when I buy and sell stocks. Not much is going to change in a company in a month, and the only time you get enough information to truly act is with the quarterly report, so unless you find a new company you want to invest in, you can't make a lot of meaningful changes outside of earnings season anyway, so just don't bother looking, or in the case of most people. Just fight the urge to look. It gets easier with time.\n\n\\-Any suggestions  \nI already suggested the 20/20/20/40 or the 30/30/30/10 split between indexes and individual stocks, and I stand by that.  \nNext time ask one question at a time. I'm not even going to proofread this that's how long it is, so I'm sorry about all the errors."

     "Not going to respond to the whole thing but I\u2019ll give you one advice regarding Apple. If you\u2019re buying today because you think they will remain a dominant player in the phone market, how much do you think is the market going to grow to justify any further share price increase?\n\nHint: not much. Most people in the world already own a phone or two and they simply won\u2019t start buying more phones. The adoption S curve is flattening.\n\nWhat Apple needs to do to grow further is find other sources of revenue. If you look at their product line (or earnings), you\u2019ll see a huge portion of their income is from other products (accessories, Apple Watch, etc.) and digital (App Store, subscriptions). In fact, Apple Store is where a lot of the revenue increase has been coming from for years. They\u2019re already diversifying and been doing so for a long time.\n\nIn conclusion, I don\u2019t have anything against Apple, but be careful about why you pick stocks and how you justify their growth potential."

     "Here\u2019s an idea. Come up with a list of sectors that make sense to you. Let\u2019s say (for me) it might be tech, healthcare, banking, real estate and retailers. Think about things that are diverse and yet you interact with them in some way. We all go to Walmart & target, right? There are \u201cofficial\u201d sectors out there - you could choose from those. Making up your own might be more fun though\n\nNow, split your money between those sectors. Doesn\u2019t have to be equal - you can be \u201coverweight\u201d in a sector if you want. That\u2019s the essence of rotation - if you feel tech has ended it\u2019s tear, and it\u2019s time for retail to take off, put more in retail than tech \n\nNow, in each of your sectors choose two companies. I like number 1 and an aggressive challenger, but you could look for an undervalued player, a fast follower, clear leader, etc. that gives you that fun of picking winners - at the same time as reducing the risk be peanut-buttering your money\n\nUpside? Diversification should make you a lot less susceptible to sudden moves within a sector\n\nDownside? If you screw up the weighting, growth j  one sector will be offset by a loss in another\n\nThis isn\u2019t \u201cset and forget\u201d, though. If you do have the sector winner as one of your picks, that won\u2019t change that often, but sometimes second place or undervalued player can change over time\n\nFull disclosure - I had a system like this at one point, but got bored with the upkeep and also felt I wasn\u2019t really beating some of the broader funds so I switched to \u201cset and forget\u201d with a few fidelity funds - mainly focused on small / mid caps"

You have Apple so I would add more to Disney to balance it out. I don\u2019t think Disney will go back to dividends but those were nice and the only reason I held on to Disney at $85/share for so many years. It had done literally nothing until it added Disney plus. That recurring revenue stream is going to be a key business driver. I think the movie distribution industry is going to change a lot post COVID and Disney is poised to win here with their platform. \n\nAside from movies, they have amazing content that they could spin off from just the marvel universe alone (eg Wanda Vision, etc).

(yes, i realize they probably won't \"make\" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)\n\nas far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)"

Basically (if I am remember the claim correctly--I'm not an expert myself, but have heard the beef more than a few times) all the leading \"experts\" were stuck on the theory that the symptoms were caused by the plaque from garbage proteins accumulating in the brain. He said that there really wasn't good evidence that this was actual the root cause, but rather a secondary effect of the root cause (sorry I don't remember exactly what he posited the cause to be) that caused both the plaque build up AND the dementia. However, all the leading Alzheimer scientists were/are absolutely invested in the plaque theory, would basically trash any research proposals that did not follow that dogma (that the experts held, who were also the most influential reviewers despite a conflict of interest)--basically if you had alternative theories it was extremely difficult to get funding, either from federal agencies (because the experts thought you were an idiot if you didn't tow their line) or from drug companies that wanted to follow a \"safe\" strategy even though none of the therapies based on this safe strategy had much effect on the disease (even if they reduced plaque).\n\nSo, tl;dr would not recommend investing in companies involved in Alzheimer's drug development, because they are stuck on \"safe\" paths even those these safe paths have been shown repeatedly to be fruitless."

I wanna tell you something I\u2019ve learned since graduating with a degree in molecular neurobiology.  \n\nAlz is an EXTREMELY tough cookie to crack.  We can\u2019t even figure out what causes it, let alone treatments and cures for it.  There are theories like alpha/beta proteins, prions, etc. The tough part for big pharma companies is that they invest millions of dollars into promising compounds, only for them to fail in testing.  Companies are getting burned by it so they don\u2019t wanna particularly spend money only to fail.  \n\nNow maybe a company like pfe or someone might get it, knock it outta the park.  I hope they do. That will be amazing.  The scientist and philanthropist side of me wants to pile money into companies so they can do this, but the realistic scientist and investor side of me sees it is a gamble.  I believe that you should invest your money in companies that match your values, so if you wanna see alz go away, do it.  It will be a long run position is all I want to say. \n\nJust my perspective.  I only have a ba in neurobiology and a few years of pharma experience, so take what you will.

In fact, she has gotten to the point that we will be putting her in an Alzheimer's unit in a nursing home as soon as I can get all of the arrangements made. (probably later this month or early next month).\n\nHer neurologist is most optimistic about one currently undergoing FDA studies from Biogen (**BIIB**).  I believe this is the drug he's looking at:\n\n[https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/08/08/biogen-alzheimers-treatment-fda-review](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/08/08/biogen-alzheimers-treatment-fda-review)\n\nI see that a couple of people have already mentioned this company, but I'll just add my voice to those.  I don't personally know anything about the treatments (even though I work full time in the health care field, that's not my area of study); but if the neurologist who spends most of his time treating this disease thinks this one shows promise, then I'd say this one is the one to look at."

     "The sad truth about AD is that no real breakthroughs have been made in decades. Like others have mentioned, research was fixated on the amyloid thesis (protein plaques in the brain). \n\nThis was the main hypothesis for last 20+ years and all they have to show for it is Biogen's NDA that has 2 Phase 3 trials which show inconclusive results. Even if Biogen's drug aducanumab is approved, it won't materially change much for patients. At best, it will be used more in future combination therapies with other approaches. This is the biggest benefit I can take from potential FDA approval of aducanumab. \n\nThe industry also started looking at another protein called tau, which was found in AD brains. The first big Phase 2 (Roche/AC Immune) also flopped. No statistically significant improvement in cognitive/behavioral measures. \n\nNew methods are needed and DNLI seems promising. But I would hold back on investing. All AD early stage trials seem promising when looking at biomarkers. The big roadblock is being able to show improvement in larger sample of patients. This generally happens in Phase2b. \n\nSo I would play early stage AD catalysts (biomarker data, small sample sizes, etc), but would stay away from mid-stage trials looking for improvement in patients. Historically, they have had a VERY LOW success rate."

I know it\u2019s a WSB meme, but you can make a buck doing that and it\u2019s not much crazier than throwing half your portfolio into a single asset. You can scale $10k pretty well if you are decent at option trading (re: not greedy)."

     "Moderna is leading the STOCK PRICE race, but you're forgetting some of the critical success factors for \"winning\" the vaccine race.  \n\n1. Even if you have successful vaccine trials, you still need to be able to MASS produce the vaccine, which Moderna's small (by comparison) size cannot do.  Therefore, they'd have to either contract out or sell out to be profitable.\n   1. 1 Point for PFE, JNJ, AZN    0 Points for MRNA\n2. Moderna has virtually no vertical integration, meaning they will pay out the ass for raw materials and APIs, plus this will lengthen their lead times as they will have to rely on outside vendors to make their product, and the other big boys won't.  They'll crush Moderna in regards to speed and cost. \n   1. 2 Points for PFE & JNJ     0 Pints for MRNA\n3. If by some wild chance Moderna \"wins\" then they are likely lacking a VERY key part of mass producing the vaccine: Glass.  Big pharma probably bought up virtually all of the world's glass from Schott/Gerrsheimer in anticipation for producing billions of vials.  Moderna was late to the party, so they're either screwed on glass or they'll have to try and buy from one of the bigger (wiser) pharma companies...again killing their margins.\n   1. 3 Points PFE, JNJ, AZN  Still 0 Points for MRNA\n4. In case you haven't noticed, Moderna's shady CEO has sold a CRAP LOAD of MRNA stock recently...which doesn't bode well for investors.  Meanwhile, insiders at companies such as PFE have been BUYING stock.\n   1. 4 Points PFE (not sure about JNJ or AZN here) and still 0 Points for MRNA\n5. The most important aspect of a successful Pump & Dump Scheme is the pump, and to be the most successful at this you'd need to be in bed with Trump and his cronies.  In this category Modera is CRUSHING the competition.  Their CEO has spent more time pumping the vaccine than working on it, so kudos to the shareholders so far because nobody pumps like MRNA pumps. \n   1. 4 Points PFE, 3 Points JNJ & AZN and 1 Point for MRNA\n\nIn conclusion, MRNA is not leading the race, they are leading the pump.  The winner will be able to mass produce with the best margins.  If you got into MRNA early then good for you, the stock is booming.  But if you're on the fence, I wouldn't chase the stock from here; I'd focus on the beaten down big pharma stocks that are likely to be the long term winners of this race, like PFE, JNJ, or AZN.    \n\nModerna is a GREAT swing trade stock, but I wouldn't count on them winning in the long run, so it depends what kind of investor you are."

     "tl;dr - early earnings reports and price multiples could also shine a light on what to expect as earnings season shifts into high gear.\n\nThis is a great post, thanks for sharing! I have set aside literally this entire day to assess my biggest holdings (anything above 3% of my portfolio, to include AMZN, BABA, CWEN, GOOGL, MSFT, NFLX, NIO, NXPI, TSLA) and figure out what to expect with earnings, because there appears to be a trend emerging that inflated price multiples could be using this quarter's earnings announcements to dial back some inflated share prices. I believe that's what we've seen with companies like CYBE, INTC, and HYLN making significant shifts downward, and I believe it's also why NFLX owners shouldn't panic (I had my finger on the panic sell trigger this week, but thankfully backed away from the ledge). I'm worried NIO could be on the danger list.\n\nI'm working on putting together better data, and if my ideas are worth sharing, I may start a thread and post them, but just wanted to throw the price multiples drop into the bucket and remind people to continue to keep an eye out for lessons learned from the earnings reports that have already come in."

     "Probably Waste Management (WM). They still took a decent beating in 2008 (down about 30%) but did better than a lot of other major companies during that time (that were down 30-50%, some more). The early 2000s weren\u2019t bad for them when a lot of companies suffered significant drops with the dot.com bubble as well. They did suffer a significant drop in 1999/2000 but I\u2019m not sure from looking at the chart quickly if that was a split or something else that occurred. They deal with trash collection, dumps, and dumpster rentals which I feel is somewhat shielded from the harsh effects of a recession.\n\nIt\u2019s really hard finding companies that remain stable and perform decent during a recession. Basically everything gets hit, often hard, regardless of who they are and what sector they\u2019re in. Stocks, by nature, are one of the more riskier means of investing out there. If you\u2019re concerned about an upcoming recession or market crash but wish to remain in the market then your best bet is looking for companies with strong MOATs, little debt, experienced leadership, and good financials."
