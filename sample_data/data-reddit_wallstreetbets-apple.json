This headset is absolutely insane if the specs that are being written in the news articles are correct. It has a 4K screen per Eye at least. It is Micro-OLED which is the pinnacle of display technology especially important in VR headsets. It reaches up to 5000 nits and has 4000 Pixels per Inch (PPI). These specs are absolutely groundbreaking to say the least. This headset is at least 5 years ahead of its competition. The downside is, that it also costs 8x more than the competion. 3500$."

Like all things Apple, they won't be the first or have the most features, and it will be overpriced, but they'll be the ones who make the thing real people actually adopt.\n\nThey'll steal it all from Humane or something, sure, but it will be the Apple version that wins.\n\nThat's my bet anyway. \n\nRemind me in 5 years. We'll see if I went wrong by buying Apple stock right before the next biggest revolution in personal computing.\n\nI don't think many people have said that, but there's always a first. \n\nWow, I really messed up buying apple stock right before GUIs took over. Wow, I really messed up buying Apple stock before laptops outpaced desktops. Wow I really messed up buying Apple stock right before personal mp3 players took off.

     "Lmao people who bash VR (note not AR) as a bad investment are so short sighted. As someone using it everyday it\u2019s like reading comments about the internet in 1992 where the news segments are laughing at notion the infant WWW would result in anything significant. \n\nIf you know someone with a meta quest go ask to play thrill of the fight (a $10 game) and experience getting your fucking ass kicked in a single 3 round fight in less than 10 minutes. You will be dripping with sweat throwing haymakers in an immersive simulated boxing match, and the best part is it\u2019s insanely FUN. I\u2019ve lost 20 pounds literally because of a video game lmao, with 0 changes to my diet. \n\nEvery person I have shown my VR headset two are amazed by it. Once the triple AAA companies start making games it will the future vr will play a major role in video games. It\u2019s is the ultimate immersive \n experience for games. \n\nAnd video games are only a fraction of the potential revenue streams. In the next 10 years the NFL and NBA will be selling monthly subscription options to watch games in VR from a court side seats perspective. The nfl I promise you, will put cameras on qb helmets to give you in the moment feel of a game from the qbs perspective. VR has so many potential options for revenue, sports and video games are just the obvious start.\n\nTLDR you are being a dumb dumb if you think VR is a fad. It\u2019s new, it\u2019s not perfect, but holy shit go use one and you will understand. It\u2019s like the first time you used an iPhone and got that \u201cyeah\u2026 this is the future\u201d feeling. I promise you, two of the 7 biggest companies in the world are not investing billions in the space without the due diligence, and more importantly foresight, to see where VR is 5 to 10 years from now. It has the potential to be their flagship product."

I do think that at a price point of (starting at?!) $3,500 it\u2019s not gonna sell a lot and Apple might take a bath on it. Not even mentioning the inherent problems that will arise when reality sets in for the early adopters who buy the stuff and find flaws or limitations. \n\n\u201cThe cord sticks out of one side and it\u2019s too short. The battery gets too hot. The lens gets foggy when I sweat. I got drunk when I was wearing it and passed out in it and now the widget thing is broken. I dropped it and now xyz doesn\u2019t work. My boss FaceTimed me while I was watching porn.\u201d\n\nI have a feeling there\u2019s gonna be some interesting things that come out of its rollout. Idk if average people are going to save up 3 months rent to shell out on a potentially fragile AF device. \n\nThey\u2019re gonna have to sell 1m units to make back the costs and they\u2019re gonna have to rely on other divisions of devices to float them for a while."

A decade of waiting and riding this ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 15 CENTS is about to pay off huge. 10x AINT NOTHIN when this one hits. I've bought a crap load more along the way.

Book value is primarily impacted by three things: net income, share issuance, and capital return.\n\nApple's BVPS keeps falling because of the buyback. \n\nJust look at their Common Stock line item and their retained earnings. When Apple repurchases shares, that common stock falls by (0.00001 + issuance price) * shares repurchased. The retained earnings falls by the (price paid per share repurchased - issuance price - 0.00001) * shares repurchased. Retained earnings also falls due to Apple's dividend.\n\nRetained earnings = Previous period RE + Net Income - Dividends - Preferred Dividends - Share repurchases. \n\nApple does $100 bn in net income, buys back $90 bn in stock, and pays out $15 bn in dividends. If they didn't return capital to shareholders, you would see their book value skyrocket by $100 bn. \n\nApple will have a negative book value if they keep returning all cash generated to shareholders."

They took the vertically developed iPadOS and seemingly tried to squish it into a horizontal space. \n\nThe settings app is by far the worse thing on the Mac I\u2019ve seen in forever. It\u2019s buggy and everything is everywhere. \n\nWe went from 1 phone to 3, plus previous models still available. We went from 1 Apple Watch to 3. We went from 1 iPad to\u2026.3?"

     "Here\u2019s something to think about:\n\nThe M2 Processor is just absolute gold. I have a 17 inch M1 Max based MacBook Pro and holy shit it\u2019s just a monster. Absolutely FLIES with Premiere Pro / Adobe CC, FL Studio is amazing, the battery life is astoundingly good, and the processor is ARM based so scaling down and up was the core design philosophy.\n\nMacBook Air\u2019s are insanely OP for their form factor now, the GPU cores and hardware support for rendering media files makes my Threadripper setup so underpowered\u2026 Oh, and iPad Pro\u2019s with M1\u2019s are the damn same. All day battery but super smooth graphics at 120fps, crazy thin form factors\u2026 Mark my words, the AR headset is coming simply because Apple realized they could with the ARM efficiency their new processor design offers. Latency and CPU/GPU handoffs are crazy optimized and every single store in my area recommends Apple Mx-based laptops and tablets for like practically anyone shopping nowadays. I\u2019m a very big fan of Ryzen\u2019s competition but Apple quietly nuked Intel and AMD in the areas that matter most: Laptops.\n\nSales are ALWAYS slow for PC\u2019s post Christmas and Black Friday / Cyber Monday. Anyone who didn\u2019t upgrade then is most likely happy where they are since PC\u2019s aren\u2019t that much faster YoY compared to the 2000\u2019s and late 90\u2019s. My 1080Ti still kicks absolute ass with a mild OC but I barely use it anymore because MacBook M1 Max absolutely demolishes it, taking less than 5 minutes on average for a render job that can take an hour easily on my desktop.\n\nConsidering how long most Apple users keep their laptops, plus Rosetta 2 barely even making a dent for x64-86 non-native software support, Apple would be king of these numbers excluding the fact that HP / Dell MINT money on lazy businesses that don\u2019t want or need to have premium devices for their wage sla-\u2026 err, workers.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Apple is basically worth more than bank stocks for long term YoY growth because they don\u2019t need to \u201cinnovate\u201d by cramming half baked features. They refine ideas into products that people get tangible results from.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll bet my hat that Apple\u2019s VR / AR goggles will use cut down versions of their M-Line processors with more GPU cores and less CPU cores for thermal headroom, reliable frame time and frame rate, as well as processing all the data into a wireless, self computing setup. Basically, do what HoloLens promised but better."

One of the things they spent the most time showing off is how it's great to just sit back and watch a movie. If it's not comfortable enough to wear for a long time and the battery is less than 90% of movies being release now days then the primary entertainment use case is gone. Using it as a a multi monitor office is also not practical...other VR products have tried it. There are definitely some cool concepts in it but it's not there yet...and 90% of the cool stuff is available in other VR products."

     "TL;DR AAPL is getting hyped for the wrong reasons despite raising the bar on VR technologies. They're instead a strong company backed by major financial institutions and have continued to build a robust and exclusive technology ecosystem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs AAPL bullish? Yes.\n\nIs it entirely because of VR? No.\n\nThere's too much information and history pointing to VR being a flop. It's a technology that is worth developing but it's just *not quite there yet*. Again, AAPL hasn't cracked the code on this... yet.\n\nI say yet, because they actually have a strong shot at taking this technology to the next level, and the reason why is because of their steady focus on size reduction, aesthetic and face tracking technology. We use our faces to express ourselves, this is a major stumbling block in VR where while it may be entertaining, there's still the ever-present feeling that you're either in costume or hanging out with a bunch of puppets. Size and aesthetic are just a given, the current headsets on the market look ridiculous and uncool.\n\nApple is also arguably better at monetization than Facebook has been, and I strongly believe that metaverse developers will step up their game to meet any extra demand brought on by AAPL products, which will increase competition and enrich the community. If you look at the situation as an economist, we all know monopolies aren't efficient in the long run. We need more players in the game like AAPL to spur on further innovation.\n\nDespite all that, that's still not the reason AAPL is bullish in my book. Apple has continued to deepen its ties to financial technology and offers a card backed by Goldman Sachs, the second largest bank *in the world.* Goldman Sachs is a titan in the financial industry and has backing from some of the most elite supporters such as Blackrock and Vanguard.\n\nThe apple card that I mentioned above is made all the more useful with its integration through apple pay, this might not sound like a major innovation but it's a strong addition to the Apple ecosystem of technology from a business standpoint. Apple earns money on interest paid on these cards, which will likely provide small but stable profit for years to come.\n\nDoes this lead me to believe that AAPL is a rocket? No. But I do still have confidence in them to stay in some sort of weird area between being a value and a growth stock."

Well immediately after that a whale at JP was seen selling 500,000 shares on the whale watcher app. This whale selling out seems reasonable correct?

     "So calmly stepping back from the noise, what do we see?\n\nThe KRE direction is obvious. Almost too obvious in the short term. XLE, XLF down are similarly too obvious.\n\nThe defensive sectors were a mixed bag today.\n\nIf you loooked in the squirrelly corners of XLF the REITs were fighting back hard.  So was BTC and thus crypto stocks.\n\nConclusion.\n\nThe market is not fully yet terrified of risk, and the weak areas are due for relief.\n\nSo we could bounce on hard-hammered sectors where shorts are overweight. Crypto goes up until we hit or even slightly surpass the recent highs.\n\nAfter that, we go down. CTAs are nearly max out on buys. They won't add liquidity. I really don't see the logic and liquidity for a rapid wave of corp share  buybacks. Even the Treasury is nearing the end of pouring liquidity into markets. Any big player scared by the bitcoin slamming recently, and wanting dry powder for what comes next, sells into that rally.\n\n\nThere really is only one source of liquidity left, other than the last dregs of retail money. And that would be if big money becomes scared enough of the debt battle that they decide money would be safer in high-grade corp bonds and securities than agency paper... and for the latter, frankly, they would do better internationally which weakens the dollar and adds pressure on the Fed to maintain rates.\n\nSo faced with two questions:\n\n1. What will the market do in 1-3 days?\n2. What will the market do in 1-3 weeks?\n\nthe first is always hard to answer. The second though, we're running out of ways for the swan song not to sound. Once either the CTAs start to sell, and doubly so when the debt ceiling is resolved/deferred and Treasury reduces liquidity by restoring its usual asset positioning, this market is effed with a razor-wired baseball bat inserted sideways and rotated.\n\nAnd yeah, tough market today. Picked up 1% on an options play for XLE that I held a little too long (could have been closer to 3%). But I wasn't willing to let it sag and risk the overnight, I just wasn't in it deep enough to have any margin of safety."

I\u2019m feeling a bit nervous about the play though, with the current price and 3x leverage, we\u2019re potentially looking at an ETF crashing moment if more bad news rolls in. Maybe I\u2019m too optimistic about regulators and the administration, but I cannot make myself believe Treasury department will not make market rocking moves like insuring all deposits, suspending short selling, immediately buying back all treasuries at par. I think I\u2019m just going to say \u201cfuck it\u201d and let my gambling portfolio blow up if the market moves against me. Or who knows, maybe my long volatility plays will make up for the regional bank plays. \n\nI know there was some bad news about PARA streaming and insurers are looking risky right now. But I was surprised how little AAPL earnings moved BRK.B. Maybe it was \u201cpriced in\u201d.\n\n\nWell, I\u2019m going to lose a chunk if UVXY doesn\u2019t hit $5 tomorrow. \n\nWith all the posturing out of Russia yesterday, this debt ceiling stalemate is concerning. The prospect of US default is minuscule, but it\u2019s not 0% and that is concerning. \n\nEnough of my rambling. Good luck tomorrow."

     "I work in electronics manufacturing, surface mount to be specific. Currently we have components (1206-09 caps) which previously were a fraction of a cent being purchased for $0.50 each! We have a huge amount of integrated circuits we are now purchasing for 500%+ of their price last year, and we literally can not source enough of many more specialized components even still with the current supply chain situation vastly improving. As an example there is a specific component I recall noticing this week. It\u2019s only a simple fine pitch S08, we have purchased it 3 times. The first two times it cost us between $1-2 per unit, our most recent PO was $53 per unit. That is more than a 2,500% increase in cost. It is currently available with a 16 week lead time  on Digikey (retailer) for less than 2 dollars, however if we ended up needed some sooner than 4-8 months we would again pay out the ass for it.\n\nThere is one particular component we use, this is a prefabricated small PCBA. It\u2019s actually a substitution for a different pcba which we have not been able to source. This particular alternate we have had immense difficulty sourcing, and often the supplier will have some in stock but deliver it to a different customer even though we had placed our order earlier.\n\nIn the current supply chain/manufacturing system there are immense difficulties sourcing more specialized components, however this is pay to play meaning something which may be essentially not available at a moderately inflated price is likely going to be able to be sourced for a huge price tag. If you do successfully place an order you may have an ETA of 1-24 months out which will often be repeatedly delayed, many times a PO will only be partially delivered piecemeal over the course of weeks or months\n\nApple is likely trying very hard to meet this project deadline, it doesn\u2019t matter if the initial production runs are losing them money because they would lose much more by not bringing it to market in an acceptable time scale.\n\nOnce they build up their stock of the components used and have less of an urgent need to absolutely get their orders in on time they will likely be able to produce this product for exponentially less cost for the materials. And keep in mind for a surface mount line as Apple uses a huge amount of the expense is in the equipment not the material, and this equipment has a usable lifespan of ~5-10 years maximum.\n\nGiven the immensely inflated cost to get components in a timely manner you can likely expect this assembly to cost less than $200 in materials within the next 2 years once Apple\u2019s stock is adequately built up and their suppliers have acclimated to the demand.\n\nTl;dr the total cost of the BOM is $2k or whatever now, but only because they need it all right now. On a more relaxed timeline it could be much much less."

Making overnight, Apple one of the biggest most integrated and well accepted fintech payments processor.\n\nthat is some heavy stuff looking long from here, not to be overhype, but it could be a 2-7yr multiX price vs share with forward splits expected, potential spinoff and massive uptick in cash volume plus user/fee base. It's crazy enough for a movie plot.\n\nIRL, I use android because I don't like having a phone master i have to pay for my own shit. Trade wise, fk it, near term volatility is profit, and obvious growth long is easy value.\n\n\\*\\*edit, derped out and forgot extended context\n\nGoldman Sachs is doing the banking for Apple, Goldman just announced step back from retail/consumer banking. It is almost conspiracy good timing for the perfect bridge to shadow bank it. Which could lead to customer and holdings increase beyond the massive volume and fees implied on all sides.\n\nInteresting times. \\*\\*endedit \n\nJust my 2 crayons."

While I know that Apple completely acquiring DIS is out of the question, but the launch of the vision pro gives apple a huge opportunity in the entertainment sector. I can see a huge upside for both companies if Apple and Disney reach some sort of deal with Disneys media portfolio and Apple TV+ to leverage the new headset. Since Disney is so down bad, I think it would make sense for Disney to be champing at the bit to enter some sort of symbiotic deal with Apple. Thoughts?'",

We have seen Google, Nvidia, Microsoft etc reap the rewards of positive AI innovation, and now its Apples Turn.\\n\\nThey should make an AIos.

Without even considering the other top 99 companies, Apple alone is worth more than the entire FTSE100 companies combined. Your economy is a powerhouse of innovation, determination and worth ethic.\\n\\nYou enjoy globally dominated companies like Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Mastercard, Nvidia just to name a few. Mean while the UK has dog shit oil companies and banking companies on the verge of bankruptcy. I cannot remember the last time the UK produced a multi billon pound company. I think it was ARM Holdings, way back in 1990?\\n\\nSo my question is simply why can't the UK produce technological juggernauts like the US can? We have some of the best universities in the world yet we don't produce hardly any good companies.\\n\\nI just want to know why...\"",

I suspect it has more to do with the regulatory environment.  \n\nThe US is far more tolerant of monopolies than they really should be (compare how the US and the EU treated Microsoft's browser shenanigans, the UK was in the EU at the time).  They also let them get away with more legal damage for much longer... to the point where it runs away from them and they couldn't put the cat back in the bag even if they wanted to.  Often by exploiting seemingly grey areas like Uber does with whether someone is a contractor or an employee.  This is something that I was seeing rulings on in the UK maybe even a decade earlier and those rulings were generally coming down on the side of them being employees.  And as far as I can tell from a quick search, that was upheld when it came to Uber as well: \n\n\"**Uber now treats all 70,000 of its drivers in Britain as \u201cworkers\u201d**  entitled to a minimum wage, holiday pay and pension plans. It comes  weeks after the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling that its drivers  were workers, not independent contractors.Mar 18, 2021\" --quoted from my Google search results, Google implies it comes from this article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html)\n\nIt's probably for the best that the UK doesn't produce mega companies (at least in the interest of the average UK citizen).  In the US, people still suffer heavily even from monopolies that were supposedly broken up at the time.  Even after Bell System was smashed in 1984, the separated companies operated regionally, effectively leaving local monopolies.  And to this day the US appears to be fairly unique in the cooperation between device manufacturers and retailers with phone companies to lock customers into long term phone contracts at purchase with strange financing options.  E.g. you cannot buy an iPhone at Best Buy without signing a cell phone contract.  You have to go direct to the Apple store to get one without contract in the US (or slightly shady methods, unlocked imports on Amazon, eBay phones that who knows..., etc.).  This level of anti-competitive operation is mostly not legal in the UK and EU.    \n\n\nLikewise, when these companies go overseas, they often have US government support even when they operate in ways that aren't normally locally legal.  Less egregiously (maybe?) these days, but the term Banana Republic refers to governments beholden to US firms operating in South America (Honduras, Costa Rica,...).  Of course British companies were able to operate that way back in the days of the British Empire, but these days the UK has less political and economic weight to throw around in that respect.  The British and Dutch East India companies started as local monopolies and again, benefited from the projection of power globally.  Mega companies require political buy in to have favorable policies and procedures through regulatory capture.  More robust political involvement and stronger regulatory authority and independence would be expected to put a damper on such massive enterprises."

     "Remember they were competitors. The Atari home computer (400 and 800) were their game console with a keyboard added.  Atari was the first to sell their computer in a retail chain - Sears. Sears, not knowing what the thing was, sold it in its home appliance department along with the Kenmore vacuum cleaners, blenders, Little Mac hamburger cookers, and ironing boards.  The sales people had no training and not a clue how it worked. They could not demo them.  So they sat there with lovely cardboard signage turned off.\n\nBushnell would have been dumb to support a competitor. Atari was bought by Waner Communications in 1976. They sold it to Jack Tramiel of Commodore fame in 1984. \n\nPeople look at personal computers as something that has always been around and has clear value. Not so at all. In the beginning you could not give them away. No one had a clue why you would want one. Hell the handheld calculator had just come out and people struggled adopting it.  The learning curve was steep; the software buggy.  The memory was so small you couldn't do much.  Then came the Visicalc spreadsheet. The first \"killer app\".  It allowed middle management to do REAL work every day and being middle management could sign off on the expense - which was SUBSTANTIAL for a real computer, keyboard, printer, terminal (or monitor) and floppy disk drives."

So far, it's working out. I have a strong thesis and think the risk to reward ratio is worth it. I hope my conviction pays off.\\n\\nAll this AI money is going to rotate into computer vision. MVIS has a patent moat for LASER BEAM SCANNING (LBS). They use this technology to offer lidar products but also have other verticals.\\n\\nThe next step for AI is giving machines perception. Check out the Garter hype cycle for AI and pay attention to the date/timelines. You can also see that computer vision is outpacing all other forms of AI (even ahead of generative AI). MVIS is computer vision. \\n\\nhttps://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/articles/images/hype-cycle-for-artificial-intelligence-2022.png\\n\\nMVIS also offers a NEAR EYE DISPLAY (NED) solution using their LBS tech.

     "Started with Mavis around the same time you did. Lowered my average to just under 2.50 when it tanked hard and increased my share count 5 fold. Also grabbed 80 calls spread between Jan 24 and Jan 25 that are now mostly in the money. Short version is Microvision had specialized in development of LBS (laser beam scanning) tech for decades. Shoot a laser at a mirror, mirror vibrates creating a scan. This can be used to create ultra efficient, high brightness near eye displays (Microsoft uses the Microvision display engine currently in Hololens,) and more importantly it can be used to create ultra efficient, cost effective LiDAR. After it became clear a couple years ago that the market for augmented reality and the display technologies that support it would not be mature for some time Microvision pivoted to being purely LiDAR focused. Specifically automotive LiDAR. They created their flagship automotive LiDAR sensor Mavin and aside from being cost efficient it is the highest performing sensor available (combination of points per second captured, operating distance, refresh rate and a few other goodies for good measure.) Management has continued to clearly communicate a timeline with milestones that they regularly deliver on. They don\u2019t BS about financials, have cash on hand and appear to have ended the insane dilution that was the hallmark of previous CEOs. I believe in the tech, I believe in the timing and I believe in management. The gamble lies in who is winning the production contracts for the next few years at major automotive manufacturers that most LiDAR companies are projecting to be awarded this year (MVIS management have reiterated that this summer is what they are shooting for.) That\u2019s basically what MVIS and every automotive LiDAR competitor is waiting on. If Im right and sweet baby Mavis captures a significant share of the automotive LiDAR market in the next couple years I get to retire early. If I\u2019m wrong I probably break even or at worst leave with bags as heavy as they were a month ago. Either way it will be decided this year. MVIS has the best subreddit of investors I\u2019ve seen so far and the best, most detailed info is over there. There are some short squeeze mechanics at play but after the last one most of the people on that sub (including myself) are much more interested in the steady climb that\u2019s been playing out over the past month."

So, when he buys, he buys permanently - unless he changes his mind. But it's very unusual for him to change his mind.\n2. Buffett is an arb. He's been arbing takeovers since the 1950s. That's Activision. He's not an insider at MSFT, but he is an arb. He knows MSFT has plenty of cash to get the deal done.\n3. To gain insight about what he's thinking, it's best to consider his new positions and adds. This year he's been buying some major oil companies and Paramount Global, HP, and Citibank. When Buffett buys he moves billions of dollars. His co-managers move much smaller amounts."

NVDA could be around 20 years from now, still in business, making a great product and have 0 stock return over the entire period.\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=2000&firstMonth=4&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&benchmark=VFINX&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=CSCO&allocation1_1=100"

The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.\n\nAnd the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.\n\nI take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. \n\nShould it be this way? No.\n\nDoes it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely.

     "How to make money off AI pump: take big positions in other sectors so that when institutions rotate gains out of tech, you benefit from the shift. Look for high volume buying or accumulation in sectors that are beaten down. but these types of plays mean you might have to sit a while b4 you experience any gains. for lottos you can see which other sectors have high volume buying pressure and take lottos (weeklies) early on those if you wanna gamble. But LEAPS is what I'm mostly talking about. I wouldn't short tech unless you have a good thesis or see heavy institutional selling. Institutions will let the pump go as far as retail is willing to pay. Then they entering distribution phase and dumping shares. Shorting pullbacks on a rally isn't smart because it takes many small pumps for institutions to unload bags on retail. Sell offs can bounce back easily because institutional selling will stop and let retail run the price back up off the dip. That way institutions can keep unloading at their target price.  \n\n\nImagine institutions dump 1/4 of their positions. Tech sells off. Bears think it's crash. Institutions stop selling and selling pressure goes away (they drive the selling pressure). Then with institutional selling pressure gone, retail dip buyers bring the price back up to institution's price target where they dump another 1/4 of their shares. So on and so forth before they finally unload the last of their position and then tech goes into freefall."

My take - irrespective of the other factors, peeps are getting less interested in 30-day options and more interested in 0TDE, 1DTE, etc. This naturally drives the 30-day premiums down - less demand for them.

It\u2019s been upsetting as on oil and gas investor to watch this fucking absolute ass clown in office fuck this up so bad. The rubber band affect is going to play out soon. Rig count is already dropping substantially again like in 2020. This will further decrease supply. The oil companies and investors like me are relatively pissed about how they haven\u2019t let the natural functions of the market play out how they should have all for an election coming up.

I absolutely don\u2019t see the case for Jpow cutting rates to address the debt ceiling fallout. JPow was bullied into not raising rates in 2018 and it is clear that was a massive mistake. I don\u2019t think he will make the mistake of using the Fed to fix political economic crisis again. He even said in the FOMC meeting that the debt ceiling is not the responsibility of the Fed. In this case, I believe him. He\u2019s not going to risk his image/legacy to fix the fallout of a MAGA political stunt. The capitulation will have to be political. \n3. A ban on short selling just isn\u2019t going to happen unless a 2008 level event occurs. It won\u2019t be a trigger but a reaction to an already occurring crisis. I don\u2019t think a temporary sell off due to the debt ceiling stunt will qualify. To get political capitulation on the debt ceiling, politicians have to let the stock market suffer in the short term so they can blame the other party for \u2018holding our economy hostage\u2019\n4.

Its a giant con job where u think youve figured out the con but its actually a double con and what you think is the con is actually the decoy and what ends up happening is the opposite. Think about this: inflating dollar is bearish for the dollar in the long run, which in turn is bearish for bonds. Blue chip stocks especially tech have an inverse correlation so they are probably bullish. Ive had this thesis since late last year and the markets reacted as I was suspecting. Remember this whole thing is a zero-sum game. If the news outlets (who are in bed with the banks and fed and treasury and everyone thats corrupt) are selling bearish news - that's like a sports book offering you a recommended bet. I don't think they want you to win in the long run so in general I would do the opposite of what they're saying is going to happen because they have no repercussions from being \"wrong\" (with their public predictions) and there's nothing stopping jamie from having his traders inverse what he's saying."

FTSE 100 companies have some pension money invested but around 2008 pensions were forced to March to liabilities so had to sell stocks for bonds, BREXIT, the U.K. Government is a mess, the island will soon be flooded by global warming, the currency has crashed from 1.60 to the dollar to 1.15 to the dollar in 6 years. The country has a persistent current account deficit, all Brits with shares invest in the US or Asia. The constantly changing tax and spend policies in the U.K. with no clear vision and instead going from one crisis to another. And finally\u2026. Boris Johnson May be the next PM (again)!

Massive red days on both CPI and FOMC that cycle...\n\nI see the same happening this month. Everyone thinks inflation is defeated, but we aren't even close. And will likely break through 10% later this year. Core hasn't really moved down, only volatile food and energy and a quick jump in energy will send us through the roof. Wouldn't be surprised to see a .3%+ higher inflation than expected this release and a very hawkish Fed pulling a 50 bps rate hike. Just what is needed to send the markets back to the lows of the cycle. Very big opportunities on puts! Don't be a sucker and get sucked into going long like all the sucker face bulls will!"

     "*\"Are they poised to rise from the ashes of the current shit show with a freshly trimmed bottom line on costs and* ***a timeless brand****?\"*\n\nIt has taken more than half a century to build the brand equity of a \"timeless brand.\" That brand equity is the wholesome family entertainment brand. For decades Disney and Pixar have been incorporating positive lessons on REAL inclusion, acceptance and tolerance in their films. The question is, will they have the confidence to keep true to what build that brand, or will they go chasing after fool's golf of the fashionable social trends of the day.\n\nBob Iger wasn't brought back just come back to get the cost structure under control, the Board brought him back to reel in the disastrous lurch into wokism and divisive extremist identity politics, as that threatens to tarnish and impair that brand equity. Ironically, it is only Disney that can destroy the priceless Disney brand. The jury is out on whether they will.\n\nWhen they bought ESPN, it was the most powerful franchise in broadcast. But it lurched so far off the rails into racism and wokism that a huge part of its brand equity has been vaporized, and its viewership numbers have been massively flushed. I can't begin to tell you how many people I know who were huge ESPN \"addicts,\" who are apolitical, middle of the road type people who eventually gave up and have gone elsewhere, they found it so unwatchable. Can Disney purge the extremist wokism from the ESPN brand before it tails into irrelevance? Warner Brothers Discovery faces a similar challenge with CNN. WBD has done a major purge, but they may have waited too late. It may never recover. I don't think it's too late for ESPN, but they're going to have to make a move.\n\nIronically, a lot this depends on whether Iger has the mettle and good sense to rise above the button-punching divisiveness of the artificial political \"battles.\" He has a big ego. It's in Disney's long term interest that he not take the DeSantis bait and stoop to engaging with him. DeSantis is not going to stop trying to suck him into a fight, so that Disney can become a prop for political divisiveness. Iger needs to ignore him, rather than knee-jerk in the opposite direction.\n\nIf Disney can stick to the timeless themes that built the brand, it's going to do just fine over the long haul. If not, the jury's out.\n\nI'd add one other thing ... there's an unanswered question as to whether Iger really understands that old media companies are going to have to transition to new platforms. They've got to get their content ported to the world of gaming, and to the world of new world social media, including Tik Tok and YouTube."

     "Last week we saw workers clash with police over at Foxconn over delayed bonus payments and working conditions related to covid 19\r And on Thursday employees began an exodus\r  \nFoxconn essentially said they had an input error in the computer system where they were giving new hires contracts for existing workers and that new recruits would be paid what was promised to them\r  \n\r  \nSo Foxconn offered up these disgruntled protesting employees 10,000 yuan or about $1,400 in two installment payments to anyone who wanted to leave to ease tensions. \r  \n\r  \nSo now they have to replace the workers who decided to take the severance pay. This is worrisome because apple had already announced they would be seeing some delays. This way about 3 weeks ago. So now we\u2019re seeing more issues in capacity over at Foxconn right around the holidays. \n\n\r  \nKeep in mind Apple is a large weight in ETF like QQQ and SPY\r  \nQQQ: 12.51%\r  \nSPY: 7.07%\n\n\r  \nNow to make this entire covid situation worse, we have these protest in xinjiang after a deadly fire in an apartment building killed 10 people. To elaborate on this, firefighters took longer to arrive to the scene because of covid 19 barricades and parked electric vehicles in narrow pathways that had lost power.\r  \n\r  \nNow let\u2019s talk about the crayon drawing.\r  \nSupport: 138ish\r  \nResistance: 150ish\r  \n50 day moving average: 146.53\r  \n200 day moving average: 154.60\r  \nDemand zone (green box): 127 to around 138, this is where you see people buying\r  \nSupply zone(red box) : around 158 to 150, this is where you see people selling\r  \n\r  \nRight now, we\u2019re sandwiched between the 50 day and the 200 day and if we lose the 50 day, we risk hitting the bottom support trend line. The first chart is showing a 10-year 1 day time frame.\n\n\r  \nThe top and bottom trendlines \u201cthicker red crayon lines\u201d create a pennant. On the second chart, I show a shorter time frame. 30-day 30-minute time frame. You can see the rejections off the top trend line a little clearer. We had 3 rejections more recently.

     "Article text for those of you who are too poor to afford a subscription (I assume most of you degens):\n\n> Hundreds of workers at Apple Inc.\u2019s main iPhone-making plant in China clashed with security personnel, as tensions boiled over after almost a month under tough restrictions intended to quash a Covid outbreak.\n> \n> Workers at the Foxconn Technology Group plant streamed out of dormitories in the early hours of Wednesday, jostling and pushing past the white-clad guards they vastly outnumbered, according to videos sent by a witness to portions of the protest. Several white-suited people pummeled a person lying on the ground with sticks in another clip. Onlookers yelled \u201cfight, fight!\u201d as throngs of people forced their way past barricades. At one point, several surrounded an occupied police car and began rocking the vehicle while screaming incoherently.\n> \n> The protest started overnight over unpaid wages and fears of spreading infection, according to the witness, asking to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. Several workers were injured and anti-riot police arrived on the scene Wednesday to restore order, the person added.\n> \n> In one video, irate workers surrounded a silent, downcast manager in a conference room to voice grievances and question their Covid test results. It wasn\u2019t clear when the meeting took place.\n> \n> \u201cI\u2019m really scared about this place, we all could be Covid positive now,\u201d a male worker said. \u201cYou are sending us to death,\u201d another person said.\n> \n> A Foxconn representative declined to comment on the incident.\n> \n> The rare instances of violence at the plant in the central city of Zhengzhou reflects a build-up of tensions since the lockdown began in October. Many among the vast workforce of more than 200,000 at \u201ciPhone City\u201d have been plunged into isolation, forced to subsist on spartan meals and scrounge for medication. \n> \n> Many eventually fled the plant on foot last month. Foxconn and the local government appeared to have gotten the situation under control in recent weeks, promising unusually high wages to attract new staff and promising better working conditions.\n> \n> Wednesday morning\u2019s protests suggest that is no longer the case. It underscores how Xi Jinping\u2019s Covid Zero policy, which relies on swift lockdowns to stamp out the disease wherever it pops up, is increasingly weighing on the economy and throwing swathes of the global supply chain into disarray. Beijing recently issued new directives ordering officials to minimize disruption and use more targeted Covid controls, but surging outbreaks in major cities have forced local authorities to reach for strict curbs again.\n> \n> Violence has erupted sporadically across China over Covid restrictions. In May, hundreds of workers clashed with security personnel at Quanta Computer Inc.\u2019s factory in Shanghai after they were barred for months from contact with the outside world, while protests have emerged in locked-down areas of Guangdong, the southern manufacturing hub.\n> \n> The Foxconn situation serves up another reminder of the dangers for Apple of relying on a vast production machine centered on China at a time of unpredictable policy and uncertain trade relations.\n> \n> Zhengzhou is the site of Apple\u2019s most critical production, churning out an estimated four in five of its latest-generation handsets and the vast majority of the highest-end iPhone 14 Pro units. Apple warned this month that shipments of its newest premium iPhones will be lower than previously expected -- just ahead of the peak holiday season shopping.\n> \n> The sprawling compound has operated for weeks within a \u201cclosed loop,\u201d or a self-contained bubble that limits contact with the outside world. That is keeping some production going. Apple and Foxconn have said they\u2019re working to replace staff who\u2019ve left and resume full production as soon as possible."

I think there could be a tipping point and a cascading effect going into recession and nobody knows if it already happened or is in the future. \n\nHaving said that, I think Burry was on to something when he said it was a BTFD generation wherein people and investors just have more risk appetite and are able to tolerate higher PEs.

(\u201cGlobalstar\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) will be the satellite operator for the Services pursuant to the terms agreement (the \u201cTerms Agreement\u201d) first disclosed in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and certain related ancillary agreements (such agreements, together with the Terms Agreement, the \u201cPartnership Agreements\u201d). The Services constitute the potential service described in the Company\u2019s previous disclosure about the Terms Agreement.\n\nSince execution of the Terms Agreement, the parties have completed several milestones including (i) a feasibility phase, (ii) material upgrades to Globalstar\u2019s ground network to enhance redundancy and coverage, (iii) construction of 10 new gateways around the world, (iv) the successful launch of the ground spare satellite, and (v) rigorous in-field system testing.\n\nThe Partnership Agreements generally require Globalstar to allocate network capacity (as described below) to support the Services and provide for the inclusion of Globalstar\u2019s Band 53/n53 in Partner\u2019s cellular-enabled devices that use the Services, for use by third parties, subject to certain terms and conditions.\n\nBUY IT MFS https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1366868/000136686822000059/gsat-20220907.htm"

     "more bearish stuff, they have high forex exposure and strong dollar will fuck them over. Last ER they blames exchange rate, they can do the same again. It\u2019s definitely not the apple product price cuts and sales they are doing in China that\u2019s hurting margins. the average Chinese citizen needs no incentive and is flocking to buy an inferior spec phone in comparison to the Chinese phones with dual fucking chips is what apple is trying to convince US share holders. Heck they haven\u2019t even provided guidance since covid yet people still view it as a \u201csafe\u201d company. The only reason the stock hadn\u2019t collapse is share buy backs which is also why EPS is still strong because there\u2019s less shares on the market\u2026. Apple is a ticking time bomb the way they are burning their cash reserves to prop up stock price. If they run out of cash it dooms the company, if they stop buy backs it\u2019ll doom the share price. One is short term demolition but survival at the end the other is permanent demolition."

When people actually try they are dumbfounded they didn't do it earlier. \n\nBut I suppose they can become a company like ibm over time."

And, I'm sure apple will negotiate down the service cost substantially since most people will not use the service. Apple sells \\~200 million iphones/year, which will increase globalstars potential subscriber base by 250x, this will probably take a few years to realize as people upgrade to newer phones. Apple is also taking most of the cost of increasing service capacity (95% of new capital expenses)."

     "Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. \n\nHad people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; \n\nhttps://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/\n\nIf anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask.

As of Q4 2022, the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, and Dow are all outperforming Apple dramatically as you can see from the charts below.\\n\\nTo put the current drawdown in context, below is a chart showing past declines of 30% or more.

A swing high is the first step needed for a downtrend to form. Once you observe a swing high has happened, the odds are greatly increased that a new downtrend has started so you want to be cautious.

They let the Taiwanese surpass them using technology that Intel itself was a primary player in developing/funding (EUV machines via ASML). Intel has recently hired a new CEO that while on the surface seems brain dead, is actually a legendary engineer who has Intel on the path to take back leadership in process nodes with 18A. Essentially, they will likely have the fastest/most energy efficient chips in the world in 2024 or 2025.\\n\\n2) AI - A lot of mouth breathers out there believe that Nvidia will be the only player in AI. They dont understand that Intel will be a major player as well. Not only because the CPU still plays a role, but because Intel is finishing a supercomputer capable of training an AI model with a trillion parameters (way bigger than chat gpt).

However, your second point I believe is way off.\n\nNvidia and its CUDA software stack are far better than anything out there on offer. AMD, Intel, and others dropped the ball years ago when they didn't properly support and push for OpenCL. It doesn't help that Nvidia never fully supported it and actively made it the poorer choice performance wise for their cards. It's so bad that OpenCL 3 is actually a rollback to OpenCL 1.2 and makes everything from OpenCL 2 optional.\n\nSo now, with the failure of OpenCL AMD and Intel have decided on their own proprietary implementations. These will take longer than 2 years to catch up to Nvidia, if they ever do.\n\nJust my two cents."

Drive 200 miles for like $9 charge that takes 15 minutes while watching Netflix or TikTok, no issues there.   Fun to drive, and yes self driving is pretty great, just got the update to Tesla vision.  Funny how statistics can be made up.  Just compare margins w ford or gm or Toyota or anyone else.  And no Tesla not just an automaker, energy storage and solar still ramping huge, more factories being built and planned.

I am a huge Ford fan (over 7,ooo shares)Musk can price them out and that is exactly what he is doing. It is simple math he wants to control  market share. All the majors are in their infancy as far as EVs go. Tesla is 10x more mature Battery wise charging wise ETC, Musk wants to grab it now and will pay up to do it. We shall see ?? but one thing I know show me an emotional investor and 90% of the time I will show you someone who lets his emotions steal his money. I could give a fuck less what Musk says . He is going to drive the model 3 price down to Chevy volt range and then watch what happens :)"

Pakistan is in the shit and so is the UK, global recession is virtually here now and China has just downgraded its GDP growth too, expect a rejection this week back under 4000 points on the SPY... sales are still on the decline, I see the rally as a classic BUY THE DIP move and positive optimism from the FED with another 25 point raise and not a 50 point raise this month, I think they should go 50 to speed up this recession... the whole go hard and go early strategy, they are taking a more controlled approach going slow and steady monitoring the effects of the raises in slower increments.... Everyone's watching the inflation rate when they should just be watching the price of oil instead... if oil gers back over $100 per barrel, inflation will raise back to around 6% and this will cause a drawn out recession until oil returns to $50-60 per barrel.... I think market sentiment right now has everyone a little to optimistic with AI in tech, until it can be monetized which is at least a year or two away I don't think it will do much, it's a hype train right now and will lose momentum, Company's everywhere are slashing jobs and slashing Dividends to cover debt and hold share prices, ultimately that over the long term drives an economy down so I don't really see a recovery in the stock market at March 2023 just because we had some stupid golden cross and you think that's an indicator to invest in because some moving averages passed each other, yes it would be a positive sign but don't confuse a bear market rally with an actual bull market rally."

Futures came within 15 dollars of hitting that 3580 price target of the collar which expired today. Does that mean SPX will see 3870+ and 3425 at some point over the next 3 months? Possibly yes but remember this is just a protective collar this isnt their prediction. The JPM collar is amessy thing to track. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ec6qs83ic2r91.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=56a3c5159924a2090f2ce1f6dbe95583dc30543f\\n\\nIt appears the trend of a red open and a red close is holding true now for 4 quarters in a row.

I think that we are entering the panic piece of the cycle next week and I do believe next week is the beginning of capitulation. Bloomberg will be mongering that we just closed at new lows and below the 200 weeklies and there is no good news to cause it to go up. Your average investor that only tracks headlines is likely feeling extreme fear right now. 2008 here we come, just my opinion. Of course I\u2019m biased cause I\u2019ve been holding QQQ $250 march 2023 puts since may.

Other vendors are years behind nvidia.**\\n\\n* The market for HPC AI cards is currently $10B. Overall HPC market is $35B. Market projections are 20%-40% growth in AI HPC buys over the next 5 years. In the worst case projection that market becomes $25B, best case is $54B. Add in all HPC buys, and the projection for 2028 sits around $50B-$80B.\\n* Nvidia's current revenue is $24B split into gaming, embedded, HPC, and other markets, so there is a good case for it tripling revenue in 5 years just based on AI growth.\\n\\nhttp\"",

     ">Why $700 next year:\n* Nasdaq-100 will go up at least 30%. This gives a baseline of $400 for NVDA next year. The market has already priced this in. \n* AI gold rush won't stop for another three years. NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI (see my previous post). However, I believe that GOOGL and MSFT have more downside than upside potential due to antitrust concerns. This leaves NVDA as the best pick in the space. Additionally, since a large portion of its revenue is derived from data center sales, it is less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn compared to other tech companies. Therefore, I believe that NVDA will outperform the market in both good and bad times which makes it a great long term investment. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time \n* FOMO - All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon eventually pushing prices even higher .This could add another 60%+to today's value giving us a target price of around $700"

  "Text": "b'The Dot Com bubble burst because the internet and the infrastructure were not ready and capable of supporting the companies going public at a rapid pace. During the Dot Com era dial up was the primary internet. Most homes didnt have a computer or cell phones and Robinhood didnt exist. Today we have fiber optic internet. More information on the internet than a person can read in one lifetime. You can order food to your doorstep or be the driver delivering the food. Get anything you want, when you want it. If the internet at the time was faster and the infrastructure was in place, the bust may never have happened.\\n\\nA primary driving factor of the bubble bursting was low interest rates from 199899 allowing LOTS of startups to open with cheap money/borrowing. We dont have that now and AI is still thriving.\\n\\nMost companies that did go public had zero earnings or value just hoping to capitalize on the boom.\\n\\nThis isnt the same. AI has been around for a while, for example IBMs Watson, A'",

     "In general, this is good position. At least once a month we have OPEX, so you have at least one profit-taking or hedging sell-off. Meanwhile, you will probably be looking at these dates for disasters.\n\n* On Monday Jim Cramer is opening NYSE and I've a comment that max paint level for Monday is SPY 377 :)\n* On July 20th you have Tesla earnings and every Wednesday is a expiration for VIX options, so big players have to buy new puts to re-hedge.\n* July 28th is AMZN and AAPL earnings. The thesis is that besides inflation that already hit, high oil prices will affect any delivery service, including FDX, UPS, AMZN, this is why you saw Bezos winning on Twitter that Biden doesn't understand the economy. Also, saudis can't increase oil production like Biden wanted, so oil is going up again.\n* Having said above, there is still a chance for SPY to bounce to 390 or even 400 before sell-off, so ideally you'd need to have some cash to average down.\n\nDisclaimer: I'm holding monthly UVXY for August @ 13"

The VIX is magneted to 34 and cant quite break over it but cant quite hold under 33. Once CPI drops on Thursday we are either 1. About to start the 10-20% capitulation move JPM is calling for with VIX hitting 45-50 by next week and we see markets hit 300-320 OR 2.

     "It is possible to create a Python app that communicates with the Robinhood API and the Apple Watch via SMS.

The app could then send SMS messages to the user's Apple Watch, which would display the information and allow the user to execute trades by sending SMS commands back to the app.\n\nHere's a possible workflow for this approach:\n\n1. The user launches the Python app on their computer and logs in to their Robinhood account.\n2. The app retrieves information about the user's account, including their available cash and the options they have available to trade.\n3. The app sends an SMS message to the user's Apple Watch, which displays the account information and a list of available options.\n4. The user selects an option to trade by sending an SMS command back to the app, such as \"Buy XYZ\" or \"Sell ABC.\"\n5. The app executes the trade and sends an SMS confirmation to the user's Apple Watch.\n\nIt's important to note that this approach would require the user to have a Robinhood account and also a python environment set up on their computer to run the app."

Now SPY could not break out and break away from 385 level. The thoughts are we either watched markets be held up by volume or there was just some weird stuff going on today. There was some dark pool prints hitting the tapes again today. \\n\\nThe other interesting thing that I noted today is that this is the first time that the day before FOMC the VIX has been red (and especially didnt spike) since the June FOMCs.

As I had stated the previous 3 peaks were 65, 62 and 68. \\n\\nI wanted to take a look at from when the FG index peaks +/- how many days till SPY actually peaks. \\n\\nJanuary the FG hit peak of 65 on January 4th and the top was actually exactly January 4th.  \\n April the FG hit peak of 62 on April 4th and the top was actually in on March 29th.   \\n August the FG hit its highest level of 68 on /august 12th and the top was actually on 16th.\\n\\nThat means on average there is about a 3-4 day variance from FG peak to actual peak on SPY before the next leg down starts. Remember I had say the average drop from the FG peak is 15.5% over 26 days. Assuming the FG could actually hit 68 maybe even 70 on Monday we could see SPY hit the daily 200ema at'",

So, I'm not really subscribing to your theory that the current \"peak\" is signaling an incoming local top before the next leg down.

We could possibly rally all of November similar to how we did in March and July of this year after \"better\" news\n\nI do think there are some considerable curveballs between now and December FOMC though. Things like midterm results (which are still being counted; really close race in the senate) and the whole FTX fiasco (who knows what the full effects of the \"crip toe\" crash will be).

I did some research on presidential deaths in office and how the stock market performed. We will be ok if it's a Kennedy move. Down 2% on first day Market was open but lbj did one heck of a job and market rallied another 20% over the next 6 months. Nixon back in 1974 scares the heck out of me. Dropped 6% on day he resigned continued down another 30% over next 18 months before bear market broke. Lots of similarities between 1974 and 2022. Almost de ja vu. Hope kamala does a good job. As far as the call collar for jpm isn't terribly positioned. It's going to be interesting to see if they will have to roll it. Just as the market goes down when they sell it. The Market will rip if they roll."

Inflation had peaked per CPI as I expected coming in a 8.3% vs. 8.5% previous, however, market honed in on year over year and month over month core. Year over year core had not gone up since April this year. I took a calculated risk with the information I had and honestly with what I knew then I woulda made the same play. Win some you lose some this is why plays like that should be small in size. \\n\\nThe worst part is prior to the bullish pop last week in the market I was bearish going into the CPI meeting and was expecting a dump. Got shaken out and bull trapped with the lower then expected consensus and forecast the psyops continue. \\n\\nAnyways moving on!

     "Thanks man, I have read your post this time and sorry for your lost and i apologize if i was being a di$k. \n\nI suspect that this week is basically going to be nothing but bloodbath because there is literally nothing to be bullish about. No one expect oil prices to be lower than what it is rn and still inflation is at 8.3% which is really really large if you account for the very low oil prices. Adding that what the fed cares about is the Core and core didn't peaked at all, and therefore, it is very highly that the fed is gonna announce 100 bp which could also be for the next time i think in November. \n\nAn important note as well, is that Jpow himself said these times are gonna be hard on Americans, basically \"hey guys your fucked\". I do believe strongly that this time the situation is worse than that in June when SPY tanked to 360 in 4 days. \n\nI'm planning to go all in on puts and especially on the 21 st that would be ana amazing day to buy 0DTE puts, I think we could easily reach to 360s, but I would love to hear your opinion (not financial advice of course). \n\nIf this works I'll recover all my loses and stop trading for good."

I think the smartest play after seeing the 6+ Vix might\u2019ve been straddles or 2% OTM spreads (condor). But it\u2019s a hit and miss with events. End of day goes down to personal bias. A coin flip dare I say.  You\u2019ve had a great track record on prior CPI trading and this one was just nasty, an outlier dare I say. I guess the only solid and reliable indicator to sell short would have been Cramer pumping the fuck out of it yesterday.

Lost about 80% of my call hedge due to not being able to close out at open (damn job). Closed my 400p position today to see how everything settles the rest of this week.

     "Up and down cycles are inevitable, just as Issac Newton once said, \"What goes up must come down\". Now, I don't mean that stocks are like gravity where it'll plummet back down to earth or to the core. But, stocks will inevitably come down, because people will want to pocket profits and reallocate assets as wise investors should (definitely doesn't extend to many of us here). That being said, for Aapl here's a list of bearish news I could list right now:\n\n* **Recession fears:** EU nations (ie: Germany) and some other wealthier nation(s) are entering a technical recession (New Zealand). Thereby, demand for discretionary goods (iphones/macs/ipads) traditionally will go down. As lending/credit will inevitably tighten, government bailouts or supports can only go so far before they can't lend any further (Not sure about this argument tho...)\n* **Sales Decline:** Certain segment of Apple products have been on the decline for the past few quarters, showing potential slowdown and worsening sales overall in the future\n* **Inflation**, while people are pointing out that inflation is declining people have to remember, we are talking about 4% inflation rate on top of a 8%+ inflation rate last year during the month of May alone. Wages have not caught up with it, and this discrepancy seems to be only widening. Yes, were not having a wage death spiral like the 70's, but we're also seeing a bigger gap in wealth. People nowadays are now more selective in their spending, giving a feedback loop to potential increase of recession. As spending slows so will profits and revenues decline for companies across all discretionary markets (Apple falls into this).\n* **Innovation**, Apple honestly, haven't really brought out any revolutionary products nor any new product(s) that can shake the whole market. Yes, they recently brought out that vision pro thing. But, at $3,500 how many people could really afford it just to \"try it out\"? Furthermore, we've seen how META, MSFT, Google all have given their shot at this eyewear market. Realistically none of them have had much success, yes maybe Apple could actually change it. But, unlikely just cause of the rich history of failures with this attempt of a product. I remember back in the 2000's seeing a teacher showing us similar 1990's version of these visual digital eyewear that was to simulate \"a new world\". Doesn't work well and haven't even after 3 decades... It'll probably take 3-4 generations before it could take off, which means cash burn. Remember Meta was confident they could pull it off, but now they're clawing back on their spending on Metaverse, that's one of the main driver in why META rebounded.\n* **Shareholders**, one of the least thought rationale why stocks decline. When a company such as Apple who have one of the largest or if not is the largest company in the world, shareholders will demand more and more out of it. This leads Aapl to one day face the same dilemma that oil companies now face. Oil companies in order to retain investors, have to return 50%+ on average of their gains back to their investors in the form of stock buybacks/dividends. While, there are a lot of reasons that differentiate between Aapl & oil companies in terms of industry demands (oil is a capital intensive market). It also acts as a good reminder that some of these oil titans of the 50-80's ended up having to return more and more over time to their shareholders in order to retain investors capital. These dividends/stock buybacks were things that Steven Jobs didn't really like overall, because he thought capital could be better/efficiently used by the company themselves. But, now Apple has gone down this road and gave out dividends and have increased their stock buybacks. When shareholders gets used to this, they won't take it kindly if Apple suddenly decreases it when it runs into a recession etc. So stock prices will come down significantly once Apple starts or slowdown stock repurchases/dividends.\n   * Look at Disney for example, yes Disney too have a lot of other reasons that Apple doesn't share commonality of why their stock prices declined from the heights of the pandemic. But, one of the things I see common when reading articles and opinions by investors is the lack of dividends or stock repurchases. Hedge funds/fund managers who want safe and stable returns looks to purchase these cash cow companies because they give a good or relatively fair return in the form of dividends/stock buy backs. Once, Disney went down this road of no longer giving dividends. They started to waver after the height of the pandemic and with more and more disappointing earnings report compounding it. Shareholders patience have only so much before they decide to drop the stock, that once gave dividends or stock buy backs. It's the fallacy of *\"once given, it's hard to go back\"*.\n\nOverall, these are my rationale why Apple could come down in the future, now these are just my opinions and shouldn't be used for any financial decisions. Also these are just the cons, I haven't listed any pros or any reasons why Apple could keep going up. There's both sides of the coins and honestly **Apple is a strong company**. I don't expect it to suddenly drop 20% in the span of a month. If that were to happen it'd have to be a recession on the scale of the GFC of 2008 or the great depression. But, just keep your toes on point and be mindful when making an investment/purchase. Do research and DD and hopefully it works out in the end.\n\n**TLDR:** Why I think a decline in Apple stock prices is cause of the following: Overbought, recession fears, inflation, sales decline in certain segments of apple products, lack of innovations that can be used/afforded by a lot of consumers, and shareholders demand. Overall, Apple is a strong company, but must be wary of this overly positive market when there's a lot of downside risk to it."

Additionally, Apple has a strong financial position with lots of cash on hand to invest in new initiatives or weather any storms that come its way.

On one hand, the muskrat has claimed that they have a multi year backlog and just can't produce those cars fast enough. On another, there are lingering quality issues, China weakness, supply chain issues, and the car is expensive as fuck, in a context where people are trying to save every dime.\nOne catalyst I can see for tesla going down is the investors smell that their pre-orders start to get canceled.

Your puts are green, that's great, basically puts on anything the past couple of months are up big time though.\n\nMusk does not draw a salary he only gets paid in Tesla stock. Therefore, he's highly motivated to stop it from falling too far and to prop it up when need be. Tesla's volatility makes it seem OK to short any rips upward but take your profits quickly or else face losing all your gains and then end up impotently hating Musk even more."

Wish i wouldve played SPY instead. Will probably gap down tomorrow morning to spite me but i didnt want to hold 3 dte with $110 theta overnight. I took your advice and switched to cash account. Much easier to cut losses now. I have a feeling we could be flat for a while, like theres no reason to keep going up but i dont see the reason to sell off either.

Right now the fear and greed index is near 62 again. The highest it has been all year before the rally ended was 68. So we are getting close.. however, now that CPI came down we have to deal with yet again the fed pivot/ slowing news media cycles hitting the tapes. \\n\\nOverall the hardest part about right now is that there actually (as far as I can tell) no bearish events or even big new events to really smack SPY back down until December 13th CPI and December 14th FOMC/ Rate hike. That is a VERY long time for this market to basically be allowed to go into rally mode. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/me0yb'",

I want to be bullish but I think we are extremely overvalued right now. Earnings are still shit and money is still expensive. I also had a coworker point out that the DOW is almost back to ATH and after I checked I realized that he was right. Absolutely crazy"

     "Hello again, I'm glad I exited my SPY puts yesterday with a nice profit even if I gave it back trying to call the reversal today lol. By the looks of it spy shot up a bit too much I would have thought we go to 380 and then dump but hey YoY is still down even if MoM is still higher. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWondering if you also saw the rising wedge on SPY today and in futes it looks to be forming a triple top. Looks like a complete reverse of yesterday might happen tomorrow where we gap down to 385-282. I doubt we go much higher than 395(heavy resistance)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nnice job on the strangle as well <3."

Vix is one of those things that ALWAYS fill their gaps with a wick but that gap wasn\u2019t filled and it\u2019s on a weekly candle. Very odd.

On the other hand I am seeing a soft rejection of the black bear channel, a rejection of the daily 20ema for the 3rd day in a row and a triple top at 378. We are pretty much stuck between 372.4 and 378 right now. With 370.6 being key support and clearly 378 being key resistance right now the risk to reward of playing anything right now especially wit'",

Going into this week and going into Thursday we had no forecast and we had no consensus on CPI.

Monday might still be green, we might even touch 410.

If im wrong, I'll close them and money lost is minimal, if im right, I'll make good money.\n\nAnd personally, even if we come in at 8.1, I don't think the market is gonna be happy because that has been a lot of rate hikes and the results have been minimal. I also think if we come in to hot.. 8.5 or greater, I think the market will price in a 100bp hike which will tank it further.. \n\nClearly, I am more bearish.

The general selling that occurred was due to the 10yr yield going to 4.2. We saw the dollar rise midday as well. However this is probably the result of the shit flinging going on at England.

     "In my opinion, market doesn't need a reason to sell off. Just like it had no reason to rally from July over 17% on nothing new. \n\nBack in March this year, the market rallied hard the first day of the ukraine war. And it continued to rally hard until one day it just stopped. Then it started to dump very hard based on nothing new.\n\nIn 2018, Powell raised interest rates, and all of these actions were known before October, they had announced their plans and began the QT and rate hikes a year before. Yet, it took a whole year for the market to finally wake up and react. The market didn't immediately drop, it was not forward looking, it just started to drill gradually based on nothing new until Powell pivoted.\n\nAnd all the reasons exist for the market to sell off right now. The recession has not been priced in, EPS and bad earnings/forward guidance have not been priced in, effects of QT and interest rate hikes still yet to be felt. Housing market is in shambles. Notice how bonds didn't change today, but stocks did, because bond market already priced this stuff in, but stocks have not. All the more reason for us to drop as stock market finally wakes up and volume picks up as the big boys come back from vacation. \n\nIf one doesn't go long on short positions here, one will not be able to go long on them at all, we will hit the bottom by the time and the opportunity will have passed. The top of the bear market rally has been confirmed, and this is the best place to enter them shorts fresh off the beginning of the descent of the next leg down to ride. Just my opinion, of course."

Monday seems like it might end up being deep red unless the media decides to pump but those fucks have flipped bearish as far as I can tell and are creating FUD.

     "I\u2019ll tell you why you should buy Tesla.   The US Federal government thanks to the inflation reduction act will literally be raining federal tax credits (cash) to hedge funds, private equity, and other companies that invest into EV sustainability.  30 cents for every dollar spent on these initiatives will be given back to be exact in the form of a tax credit that can be sold.   \n\nDo you understand what this means and the amount of companies that will become the next EV pioneers to get back 30% for everything they spend?  These types of tax credits (cash back) will even have companies like Chevron scratching their heads thinking should we open another rig or take that money and become EV charging station manufacturers and be guaranteed to get 30% of the investment back.  \n\nWhat does this all mean?  It means the company selling EV cars and most established in EV (Tesla) will have most to gain as a result of all this investment from the tax credit hungry venture capitalist looking for a 30% guaranteed return from an investment.  There will be close to $500 billion worth of federal credits printed over the next 10 years.  It will not be abnormal for even small time people to be able to buy a federal credit on the resale market for 90 cents on the dollar from one of these venture capital offices that has a shit ton of them to sell.  If you owe 100k in federal liability in the years to come you will be able to buy your federal liability from a VC for 90k cash and save yourself 10k in liability to the federal government for buying your liability instead of paying it.  Large businesses will do this also to a huge scale.  Owe 10 million in liability hit up VC office that invested in EV initiatives and buy $10 million worth for $9 million cash."

Brainard wasn't exactly dovish or hawkish in her interview today, but she did caution that CPI data that came out is not enough to stop raising rates. But, the fact that she reiterated that size of rates could be smaller was a welcomed sign by markets. Though, inflation expectation numbers today, and consumer confidence last Friday are headwinds for markets. So, if PPI is lower than expected that might be the catalyst to push us over that 400 wall. That would make it a second data point that is \"confirming\" that the fight against inflation is working."

Thing is- once that profit is spent on buybacks IT IS GONE. It is paper. Let\u2019s take this balance sheet of green ink and buy our own shar.. oops it\u2019s gone. \n\nThey can sell it sure, but are they going to *waste* it on workers again? Fuck no. Golden parachutes or get out of jail free card when their PE is so bearish it powerbottoms out.\n\nTL;DR about 99.9% of you should hate stock buybacks as you don\u2019t have extra money to blow on your own self funded share buyback program/gambling addiction/ ability to afford your own home in your late 20\u2019s, 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s. Look at real wage growth, look at share buyback programs- motherfucking DD is SPICY.\n\nFuck you ancient boomer Buffet, suck my balls!"

     "From a very fundamental market standpoint buybacks are a very reasonable activity.  Here is your 5th grade education if you happen to be in a double digit iq career like day trader or congress.\n\n1. Companies without enough $ to grow sell stocks to get $.\n\n2. If a company needs more money later on the only options they have are:\n\nA. Print more stocks which makes all stocks less valuable\n\nB. Buy back stocks when you believe they are undervalued (e.g. recent market lows) so you can sell them again later.\n\nIf you are in a situation where you have a lot of cash and can't reasonably handle major expansion (e.g. adding a new building isn't feasible because you don't have enough skilled staff to handle a launch on top of the other expansions you already have in process) then buying stocks back makes sense.   It is investing in your own company to help set up funds for future growth.  \n\nThe problem is not stock buy backs existing as concept.  Even in cases where people are angry about buy backs they are generally pointing to areas where employers cut corners on things safety, quality, infrastructure or staffing."

We still need to see closer to 380 to test that. The biggest thing I am seeing right now is that SPY is holding 356.5 to 378.3 range for the last 19 trading days. We are in consolidation mode. The closer we get to 378.3 the more we should be eyeing a retest of 356. However, if we can truly breakout over 378.3 and retake 380 (50%'",

Not only that but the VIX was rising most of the day (which to be expected with CPI tomorrow) and Apple hit 4.3%+ at one point and while Apple was going for ATH it seemed like SPY struggled almost all day. Definitely an interesting disconnected day. I traded until about 1130 and after that I refused to touch it. I didnt really see any of my idea trade setups today either with the chop and random little dumps SPY would have. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6gm9s8oohn91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8643011ba69e21499a67b0c99ec5a026f38a7927\\n\\nI am going to keep this TA super short and simple and to the point.. why?

For the amount that oil has declined if there\u2019s not a significant beat it could be seen as inflation being very sticky at a high level."

     "With apple as the biggest stock in the market and the biggest share of SPY. If there was some catalyst to come out against apple in a bad way. How much would a 5% drop to apple mean to the rest of the market? that would be 120 billion wiped from apples value. \n\nOne of the ways I look at it is apple is the number 1 stock to store cash. Not gonna see massive volatility and holds its own. But with the rest of the market getting demolished and apple holding its own you would have to think some of that big money would sell out of apple and go into different stocks that are down 70% on the year. Basically when the market starts to rally you might see someone people take their cash out of apple to switch over to more volatile stocks. Basically I believe we either see apple hold its own in the 150-160 range for quite sometime or we see a downtrend in the 15% range in the next month. Overall it just seems to me apple is holding the market together and if it we\u2019re to drop big time we\u2019re looking at some all across the board serious drops. My 2 cents"
