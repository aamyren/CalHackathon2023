The company must refund the full purchase price to the plaintiff.\nJune 15, 2023 - 5:11 pm Now share\nThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had \"actual severe defects\". Source: AP\nTesla Model S\nThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had \"actual severe defects\".\n\nBerlin, D\u00fcsseldorf The electric car manufacturer Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered on Monday that Tesla must refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The reason is \"serious defects in driving comfort and safety\", including unwanted braking.\n\nAs far as is known, there is no higher court judgment against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The decision of June 12 has 14 pages and reads like a reckoning with the statements that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making about the quality of his driver assistance systems for years, often under the term \"Autopilot\"."

     "I think tesla is in trouble. They got so big in their early years because the tech in their cars was better than other brands, their electric range was higher than anyone else, and they were the only brand capable of mass producing electric cars to meet demand. This was the reason so many people were overlooking the very clear quality control issues that they have. The most important thing they had to do was solve their QC issues before other brands caught up. However, other brands caught up and tesla still faces terrible QC concerns. This may affect them a lot in the future. \n\nNow, other brands have similar or better technology and driving assistance. Everybody has a big screen, a trend that Tesla started.\n\nOther brands have developed better autonomous systems than Tesla. Mercedes, GM, and Ford are the top now.\n\nOther brands have electric cars that equal or beat Tesla's range and charging speeds.\n\nOther brands are able to produce and develop electric cars at a good rate. It can be argued that brands are still catching up in this sense, but they are most definitely catching up at rapid speed.\n\nThe last current saviour for Tesla is their far superior charging network. This was something that was planned to take ***years*** for other brands to catch up to. However, they are catching up fast. Furthermore, other brands are now gaining access to tesla charging network. This is another nail in the coffin for tesla.\n\nTesla is running out of time to solve their issues. They need to address the issues in their cars before the other brands leave them in the dust. When the other brands have better electric cars that are readily available and affordable, along with good charging networks, tesla will struggle to sell units."

I allow it to range 25-30% (just turned 40yo) but would be much heavier if I were younger. It's allowed me to buy heavily (2018, 2020, 1/2023) and trim accordingly.

This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nLopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.\\n\\nThis investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist.

     "Nice job.  I was also a Tesla fan and can\u2019t help but wonder if full self driving is significantly impacting their credibility.  Elon said it will be fully functional in a couple years around 8 years ago at this point.  I don\u2019t think people will continue to add the feature considering they haven\u2019t delivered.  Cybertruk and the semi also seem to be having problems delivering.  Elon has also indicated they are building a robot now?  I can only assume it\u2019s to work on Mars prior to the arrival of people?  Long story short - Tesla has lost focus.  Supporters would often stand in line and put deposits on their vehicles because they believe in the mission (as you said).  As they fail to deliver, this fan base will continue to dwindle.  Add these points to the amazing point in your post and I think Tesla is in trouble.  There\u2019s also the fact that they clearly haven\u2019t figured out full self driving.  How many cars will they need to retrofit because they were sold as full self driving capable?"

Biden didn't invite Tesla or ever mention it when talking about EVs? Despite the fact that Trump had no interest in EVs or global warming, he still reached out to Elon with open arms, who was a very prominent and public Democrat at the time. Biden turning Elon into public enemy #1 when he has done more to advance green energy, job creation and manufacturing in the US, AI dominance, and space and energy independence/leadership is just straight up corruption because we all know who donates to Democratic politicians. \n\nAlameda County tried to literally bankrupt Tesla by being the only place to prevent manufacturing in the US indefinitely when Tesla only had one real factory producing at scale? Warren and Sanders and AOC and Reich tried to call Elon evil for the last 5 years just so they could take his Tesla shares as taxes? The media called Elon a MAGA Republican despite him never previously voting for a Republican (including Trump)? The media making up lies about his Twitter takeover and covering up the Biden laptop, government collusion, speech suppression and censorship, and blatant 1st amendment violations, and the SBF fraud while making Elon look like some evil dictator? Let it be known that the left deliberately tried to destroy Twitter before Elon even tried to do anything to fix it by forcing an advertiser boycott, causing him to fire 75% of the staff to reach cash flow neutral, which then the left used to call him a monster.\n\nYou can't repeatedly punch a guy who fixed your house and put your kid through college and expect him to keep his mouth shut. And then to call him some sort of racist/homophobe/evil capitalist trying to destroy America as some fascist when literally the definition of fascism is government control of private companies by groups of people fascinated and preoccupied with notions of racial supremacy and authoritarian rule that has restricted free speech (literally the current Democratic platform), is just insult to injury. The fact that people give friends of Esptein a pass like Clinton and Bill Gates, and support companies like Apple that build phones in sweatshops with suicide nets just to call Elon Musk a crazy person who is immoral and losing his grip on reality is just rich."

He *did* have a knack for getting into exciting future sectors. But that's it. He is actually a shit manager and decision maker.

A very long time ago even before Tesla started gaining any traction & before it was in the news all the time, I discovered Tesla and told a lot of people about this amazing car I really wanted.\n\nThen I started to follow Musk on Twitter and realised for myself what a POS he was even before the sub incident so stopped following him. Then the sub incident happened and Musk started to slowly snowball into an even bigger POS and as he grew bigger my interest in wanting a Tesla became smaller and eventually I no longer wanted one.\n\nThen a good friend invested in them and very quickly turned into an obsessed cultists just because of how much money it made him, and eventually convinced me invest too. I managed to put my morality a side for a while, but whenever I was going to sell at the top he convinced to hold on, and I did not because I believed in Tesla, but because I believed dumbasses like him would continue to pump it and I was in it for the ride.\n\nThen at the beginning of the year the markets started coming down and I finally managed to pull out entirely while taking some profit, and kept contemplating whether I should invest back into Tesla alongside the others, but my morality just taking even bigger hits as Musk had turned into one of the biggest c**ts on the planet.\n\nNow just like with Facebook I longer want anything to do with Elon & Tesla. I got rid of Twitter because of him too (though I physically can't log back in to delete my account) and I just hope my friend's sake he'll wake up before he loses everything.\n\nThere's only one small thing I disagree with though in your view, and that's that Tesla can never shake its association with Musk. I believe it could eventually but it would take a very long time after he's no longer involved. As you said now when you mention Bill Gates a lot of people do still think \"Microsoft\", however when you say \"Microsoft\" most people no longer think \"Bill Gates\" (aside from maybe those who still believe he's the richest man in the world)."

It has gone up since I bought it. That is not why I invested; I did it because I believe in their mission and product. The bad news is that Elon Musk will continue to damage the brand because of his personal opinion on things, including climate change. Right now, this is not a big deal to me because I do think they will get through this difficult time and will have solid growth going forward, but my confidence could very easily be hurt if they are unable to execute well or if they cannot execute at all. Tesla's stock price hinged on the self-driving car market. I'm not sure what the prospects are of them building a monopoly in this space, but that was a major reason why I was comfortable investing. If they cannot execute well and they lose some time to competitors they will have trouble growing as quickly as they need to. To answer your second point, yes Elon Musk is a big advertising asset for TSLA. He is an amazing leader that has made incredible strides in the development of battery technology and has improved the efficiency of cars incredibly through Tesla's design. However, Elon Musk is also a big liability for TSLA. He is the face of the brand, which means that the people who are considering the purchase of a Tesla and those that already have one will be influenced by his antics, including his expensive tweets."

     "As margins compress valuation has to come down. Makes sense that the stock has sold off after the earnings report. However, for those longer term investors this should come at no surprise and make you more bullish. Why? Tesla has been following Ford's early 1900s playbook and will continue to do so as they move down the cost curve to capture market share.\n\n>The real breakthrough came in 1913 with a proprietary innovation, designed by his production managers: the move from batch production to a continuously moving assembly line. The effect of simplification and scale was to move the price of a Model T down to $550 by 1914, when 248,307 of them were sold. By 1917, the price had fallen even further, to $360, with the result that sales soared to 785,432. In 1920, Ford sold 1.25 million Model T's. Compared to 1909, a price reduction of 63 percent -- to almost a third of the original price of the Model T, which was itself a good fifth cheaper than comparable cars -- had resulted in a sixty-sevenfold increase in the number of cars Ford sold.\n\n>Simplifying made the company's cars both easier and cheaper to make. And the price reduction was enormously effective in boosting the whole market as well as Ford's share of it. By 1920, his share had soared to 56 percent, three times larger than that of his nearest rival, General Motors, which was an agglomeration of five different car brands. Ford was by far the most profitable car company in the world, both absolutely -- relative to sales -- and relative to capital employed.\n\n>Even Henry Ford himself was surprised by how much demand responded to the lower price. A price reduction to 35-40 percent of the original price boosted sales by more than 700 times. **The fact is, the relationship between price reduction and demand expansion is asymmetrical. If you cut price by half or more, demand rises exponentially -- by tens or hundreds or thousands of times.**\n\nAny of this look familiar? Tesla is moving from the continuous assembly line to a [deconstructed process as shown here](https://images.app.goo.gl/Mehurhib5Yhr1Ckf6) which will further reduce the cost and time to manufacture. Yes there will be short term pain but the long term story looks bright"

     "At the risk of sounding arrogant I'm gonna call you out a little bit and say this really has nothing to do with Musk. Sure he's unhinged but if you felt comfortable about the fundamentals of the company it really wouldnt matter. You're being too influnced by the price of tesla all together and you need to take the emotion out of this. \n\nThe only way to do this is via a grounds up valuation for the company. A basic rule I think you should use is to assign a reasonable estimation as to what true value of the company. If you can't do this for Tesla then I think that in it of itself says something about your position.\n\n If you have a rational argument built on basic facts and numbers then you'll know what to do. Do you think Tesla is worth $5 trillion? That's what's required for you to 10x from here. Do you think it is worth $1 trillion? That's what's required to double your money. If you don't know then you're certainly taking a big risk without knowing your odds. \n\nIt's a matter of working backwords, how much would a company have to make to be a $1 trillion company? How long would you be willing to wait? Personally I'm more interested in opportunities that are likely going to 5-10x. Since I think 5 trillion is a bit of a stretch barring some more market mania (which is unpredictable) I'm going to other opportunities where my confidence level is significantly higher."

And let me tell you something, the rates won\u2019t stop going up for a while and they will stay there for a hot minute. \n\nNow ask yourself, if you are holding at a monstrous gain, one of the most nonsensical valued investments and the macro backdrop is literally going back to the good ole high interest rate times, shouldn\u2019t you be locking in most of those gains? I certainly would; unless you know something we don\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s a fantastic company but it\u2019s not the best time to hold it. This market is unforgiving and cares about margin stability and shareholder yield flow through - it will largely punish any negative news and will have strong resistance on the short term uptrends. \n\nThis is what I would do. If I added this at a weight of 5% on my portfolio, I would rebalance the position back to 5%. If the stock continues to fall, invest back in at a relatively sensible valuation. \n\nAt this moment, it\u2019s trading about 4x the SP500s forward P/E.

Usually it was not his erratic behaviour (though that came up) but for example some medical stuff that would render him unable to lead. \n\nI didn\u2019t go into Tesla because I was unsure about the stock, especially with a very high seeming valuation and unclear metrics in the future.\n\nNow I\u2019m asking myself if I would not invest if Musk wasn\u2019t CEO and majority shareholder and at below 200 that is probably a yes but I still most likely won\u2019t because I don\u2019t TRUST MUSK. \n\nIt isn\u2019t so much that I don\u2019t like him (though I think there are ample reasons to dislike him - at least politically), but I try to not make investment decision on personal issues. However his approach to selling Tesla shares he got as options for his ventures, him alienating a lot of potential customers, the lack of new developments in the company (not unlikely because of success with already existing models paired with distractions by other projects)\u2026 just don\u2019t make it feel right to me.\n\nTherefore I could understand you, OP, if you cashed in your gains."

     "Well, Elon was saying for years that FSD is around the corner, so very few people expect FSD to be anywhere near now, but I think that we might be really getting close to FSD in the near term. 10.69.3 is a big improvement, just compare it to what was 1 year ago. I'm not saying it is ready as is but there are now 3 million Tesla's driving on the streets and sending data from their cameras and Dojo is really around the corner to give Tesla the power to process all this data. And really FSD doesn't need to be perfect to be legalized (I mean legalized to drive without the driver, just passengers) - it just needs to be safe enough. That means that taking suboptimal route, going to slow, stopping on the street (given its safe) or even scratching a parked car is not a no-go for FSD as these doesn't endanger anyone, they are just inconveniences, suboptimal comfort or damages that needs to be payed. If the trade-off for them is saved lives, and Tesla would be able to prove it, then I think FSD legalization might be quite close."

Reduced margin, reduced volume in all markets.\n\nIf that's true is that built as a bear case of this model?\n\nYou have not speculated on the fallout of brand destruction due to becoming increasingly unhinged on Twitter, and specifically toxic to liberals with money, his primary sales demographic. Let's say 1 in 10, 2 in 10, or 5 in 10 customers are now compelled to choose a competitor; how does this affect Tesla's ability to generate revenue and profit?\n\nYour bear case is very mild. If even 2 in 10 customers are turned away and gross margin drops by 50%, this is starting to become a calamity. There is potentially far more risk that this post assumes.\n\nThere are many anecdotal reports of people embarrassed to drive Tesla's or are no longer interested in buying. The evidence will be in the next 2-3 quarterly reports."

Regardless of where YOU stand on the political landscape, it's about the consumers buying the product and if half of them aren't buying it because they don't support extreme right ideology means you split the market in half. \n\nIMO, TSLA is the worst investment to have, to be holding, to get into. I rather invest in a company that caters to everyone. Also, the clock is ticking. Manufacturers are catching up to EV. TSLA is no longer the only manufacturer anymore and it's hilarious to think otherwise.\n\nIn addition to manufacturers catching up, battery power and infrastructure isn't catching up to speed. I highly doubt the EV shift is happening at the designated time frames they desired it to be here at. It'll prolong ICE and make TSLA harder to invest in."

This breezes over the fact commodities required to produce these cars at a scale of their growth with more competition in their space is going to drastically reduce profit. This is before you factor in the actual cost of ownership for consumers as ESG policies are showing cracks with pressures on grids and consumers being asked not to charge cars. Honestly, I think Elon knows the game is over. Maybe he thought it would go on a little longer but with interest rates high and inflation still a problem I\u2019m very skeptical we will see Teslas or it as an individual company in the long term. I think Elons twitter acquisition was a way to stay relevant and move into a space which isn\u2019t levered on low interest rates. Something which could still help his passion with space exploration. Whether he will cut his losses and sell or it will be forced to close is something I can\u2019t predict. I think recently you\u2019ve seen his interest is not in Tesla anymore."

     "I got in at 48, I got out at 82.  To say the entire market has been a volatile shit show since 3/20 is the understatement of all-time.\n\nI will say this though, since I started viewing the SPX as the U.S.'s capital account, things do make more logical sense.  The reason TSLA hasn't gone down more than it has (and likely should if traditional TA matters at all) is AAPL.  VOO and SPY and all other SPX derivative funds have not seen marked outflows to the level commiserate to what the Bond market has to say about liquidity.  TSLA is in the SPX.  AAPL is being used internationally as an inflation hedge and as a defensive domestically.  Ditto the other top 9% of the SPX weight (look at how it breaks down).  But not to the level of AAPL.\n\nIf I told you the SPX was a derivative of its top 5 companies and that they made up the vast majority of exposure of almost any investor in the stock market would you believe me?  If the SPX is the US capital account, then the derivatives are all just planets around the highest weighted corporate suns.\n\nAs such, TSLA is a riskier derivative of the same pot.  I would be a buyer under $90, but I am out of it at $99.  Unless there is substantial adjustment to the SPX between the time I buy and the time I hit my limit.\n\nThe only stocks I have real determination on right now are auto parts stores AZO and ORLY precisely because of the increasing complexity and interest rate sensitivity of new car sales.  Plus so many people are underwater after overpaying for used cars that they will all end up on the road until they are beyond dead.\n\nEven then, I won't grow my existing positions in my taxable account unless I get assigned on puts.  There's far more money to be made in CSP's right now than actual ownership.  The volatility range is tight.  GEX and VEX have been pretty reliable indicators on setting your prices.  SKEW ticked higher before this upcoming dead week.  And I wouldn't mess with TSLA on options anyway, even though there is a MOUNTAIN of puts right now.  The SPX is volatile enough."

If sentiment towards the stock turns negative then it could easily trade below fair value which could price it around $70-80 imo.\n\nTSLA was the first stock I ever brought in 2012. I invested largely because I admired Elon, but a couple of days ago I realised I don't really like him anymore. And it's not even the political stuff, it's the arrogance and the constant lying that I can't respect.\n\nI've said for a long-time that if TSLA ever drops back down to my price target I'd buy back in (sold in 2020), but I don't think I would now. The company isn't doing anything interesting and I'm not sure I like the CEO anyway.\n\nIf I owned it I'd at least be selling a chunk of it because there are plenty of great deals out there right now.

So that is a factor as is margin compression.\n\nBut to your concern that the Elon storm will pass I am not so sure.  38 percent or more of Tesla buyers are registered Democrats.  Taking just the liberal or anti-Trump label that increases.   The EV market overall is 41% Democrat to 27% Republican.  Also most Tesla and EV buyers identify as Miilenials and Gen-Z.    He is systematically destroying demand from the groups who buy them most.   \n\nHe is seen as the Kanye of cars.   Kanye album sales since September are down 17.5% worldwide, radio play dropped 13%.  But really his popularity has been declining steadily since switching into a blatantly political position that is the opposite of his fan base.  \n\nElon doing what he is doing is like Garth Brooks going Chris Gaines and this moment really is a Howard Hughes or probably more accurate Gerald Ratner moment for Musk and Tesla and I think the damage he is doing is being grossly underestimated."

I went against the purchase because Tesla and others were not willing to give me my fair value for trade in. \n\nTesla has several big problems. They are a premium car without premium features.\n\n1) Self-driving:  There is a lawsuit about this and Tesla's response has been that self driving is a goal and aspiration. Meaning they really have thought on how to bring this out as a product. As they are re-introducing the radar it means their vision basis is not working. How long till they have to get lidar and map? Who knows, but one can say that their self-driving is not something that will set them apart.\n\n2) The Tesla system is an OS all on its own. Carplay? Autoplay? Not a chance meaning either I get Spotify or I have to use old bluetooth audio, which truly sucks. I rely on Google Maps for all of the information and there is none of that. Meaning a premium car system is not premium.\n\n3) Their cars all look alike. My wife can't tell the difference at all. The models are also getting long in the tooth. Meaning they will need to do a massive reinvestment in tooling, etc for the next product line. As there is no future plans to redo their cars people will look at their cars and go meh...\n\n4) The styling has nothing special. If you look at the various car makers they have little gizmos and extras that attract people. With EV's turning into the smart phone you will need special features to distinguish yourself, and there is nothing there.\n\nTesla had an early competitive advantage, and that is it. There is no second round. Heck I am surprised so little is talking about the Tesla Semi. This all tells me that TSLA (if it survives as a stand long company) will have a valuation compression. I can't see this going up.\n\nI also would like to highlight I have not commented on the shite show that is called Twitter. If you look at the stats there the \"woke\" crowd that has rejected Musk and Tesla, but the \"MAGA\" crowd have not decided to buy Tesla's."

And that\u2019s based on analyst estimates for revenue and earnings, which have consistently underestimated Tesla basically every quarter for the last 2 years. Analyst estimates for Tesla\u2019s 2023 earnings are up 46% over the last year, and I estimate it is still 20-30% too low of an estimate (unless there is a very harsh recession in 2023).\n\nThis has happened before - Tesla grew their business extremely fast and manifold while investing heavily, yet the stock price was basically flat between 2014-2019 before it finally exploded in 2020/2021 to account for the massive growth that hadn\u2019t been priced in. Now Tesla stock is flat for over 2 years despite growing revenue 164% and profit 17x. The hive mind consensus in r/stocks that Tesla is still overvalued is wrong, and the people who say that either haven\u2019t paid attention to Tesla\u2019s growth trajectory, are way underestimating Tesla\u2019s future growth trajectory, or don\u2019t understand how to value growth companies.\n\nHold through the noise, and in the long run, the market weighing machine will determine TSLA stock price to be much higher than where short term voting machine values the stock."

It might not collapse tomorrow but it'll be soon.\\n\\nI had a few thoughts, twitter going bankrupt and becoming worth nothing means Elon will need to pay back loans him self? He'll need to sell more of TSLA to do this, which should bring the price down?\\n\\nI think hes showing himself to be a bit insane and a terrible leader and the cult of elon that contributed to propping up tsla might disappear. A lack of confidence in the CEO could cause the stock price to drop in the future? \\n\\nThe market in general still isnt that great, stocks might just go down anyway.\\n\\nThinking of taking a gamble and maybe buying puts or shorting tsla.

     "Honestly, I'd be more worried about the Chancery court case that is going on right now. All of the Twitter fire is working perfectly as a diversion\n\nIf you have a chance to read into Musk's testimony on Wednesday, cross in particular, oh boy. Also Antonio Gracias's testimony.\n\nIt gives the impression that Tesla has a completely nonfunctional board that is pampered by Musk and does his bid. That things are either Musk's way or the highway. And even more worrying, the testimony of the other people close to Musk has been quite eye-opening in the fact that they cannot clearly state what even Musk's contributions to the company are. They all state he sleeps on the factory floor, and amazing management style and so on, but the plaintiff's lawyer on cross has been pointy and specifically asking for specific contributions of Musk to the company, and no one can give a straight answer. The whole \"genius engineer\" meme is falling apart badly.\n\nSo yeah, Twitter is a distraction to another fire, from which TSLA will sure suffer. Twitter itself is being salvaged now by more private endeavors, there is a reason why it was SpaceX buying ad space in Twitter and not Tesla (where Tesla would have made much more sense)\n\nThen again, don't short cult stocks"

     "Twitter is probably going to be done at some point soon at this rate and it's too bad.\n\nElon thought that he could demand people be \"hardcore\" and that they'd all fall in line; it's one thing to sell people on a mission of saving the planet (Tesla), it's another when it's Twitter and demanding \"hardcore or leave\" works out about as well as it would if this was a \"Silicon Valley\" episode. \n\n Additionally, they apparently offered a few months of pay and benefits. If people in the company thought that the company was heading for disaster and they could get benefits now and leave or get nothing when the company implodes, a lot of them took the offer.\n\nApparently, a number of them just hung up during a video conference when the deadline for choosing to stay or leave rolled around. Elon was still talking - https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1593405187745619975\n\nI think the Twitter fiasco takes attention away from Tesla and should give people who worship him some pause. Eddie Lampert took over a decade to destroy Sears and literally slow walked through trying to tear the company apart piece-by-piece in order to try and benefit himself. Elon is basically speedrunning his attempt to destroy Twitter and how that is to his benefit I'm still not entirely sure.\n\nJohn Legere - the guy who turned around T-mobile and did a pretty spectacular job at it - tweeted at Musk that he would run Twitter. Musk's reply? No. Why in the world wouldn't Musk want someone like that ASAP?\n\nIMO, the Tesla-related concern is also the politics. Telling people who to vote for when you're running two consumer facing companies is an absolutely insane thing to do in this day and age.\n\nAs for Twitter, I've thought for a long time that it would be better off in someone else's hands - 1) apparently not Musk's and 2) maybe that time has already passed; this is a much more unforgiving environment and you've now saddled the company with more debt and seem to have no plan, even tweeting that the company will do lots of dumb stuff in the coming months and will keep what works and drop what doesn't. That...doesn't sound like there was a clear plan in mind to begin with and given the state of the company, \"try some stuff and see what works\" is not going to work in this environment for very long. \n\nMusk basically came into Twitter acting like he was going to make things up as he went along. He's already spooked brands, which isn't great when your business is primarily ad space. Subscriptions? Apple gets a big part of that. With what Apple did with advertising and iOS, it feels like the social media business was impaired to some degree before Musk bought. Facebook's attempted Metaverse pivot is because they have to.\n\nIf the easy monetary policy of the last decade or so is truly over for many years to come it will be interesting to see how Musk fares.\n\nTLDR: Nothing about the Twitter fiasco has been positive for Musk, from the distraction of it, the lack of a clear vision for Twitter, the speed in which it seems to be falling apart under his leadership and there's nothing good about it for Musk \"the brand.\" Also, for someone who has something like half a dozen companies, he has a lot of time to tweet - he's Tweeted so much more since buying it. Buying the company at all was not a good idea but there was no reason Musk needed to be the face of the company - he should have had someone else as CEO from day one."

Just saying that it's a good price to get in now, and DCA if needed. Even if you're not long TSLA, this is a good short term swing trade.

He's BULLYING the Twitter board to accept a low-ball when it should sell for in the mid-$60s AT LEAST. Watch Google/FB come in and out-bid Elon to buy the company!!!\"\n\n\"There's a poison pill? Elon WANTED that to happen so now he can announce he'll dump all his stock at a PROFIT and create a Twitter competitor! What gimmick PR.\"\n\n\"He actually bought it??? Well...Elon and Jack Dorsey colluded to force a gun to Twitter's head and agree to acquisition of $54.20. Billionaires play by their own rules. Elon's evil.\"\n\n\"Elon's trying to get out of the deal?

Who cares if he lost some money from his ownership of Twitter stock?\"\n\nSeriously.\n\nKeep hating on the man behind two companies that are fundamentally changing the world in some of the most significant, societally important ways.

He starts talking about backing out, and creates a frenzy.\n\nAnd then he backs out. He knows what\u2019s next - they\u2019ll start squeaking about suing. But does the board want to? Are they dumb enough? And even then, what\u2019s the fallout if they don\u2019t?\n\nIf they sue he gets to force them to disclose real users vs bots and fake accounts. In public.

He could walk out into the middle of 5th avenue, pull out his finger guns and go pew pew pew and secure 5 Billion tomorrow. In other news his stake in TSLA and Twitter are matters of public record which may or may not mean anything if there's swaps and loans are involved. As for the other auto manufactures, sure the ones from China will wreck shop however Sandy Munro doesnt give good odds on just about everyone else. TSLA does have the advantage of being first however they also figured out how to build the cars the most efficiently. Other manufacturers will have to emulate printing out the front and rear of the body in white going from hundreds of parts to 2 to match. The chip shortage will be on going for at least another year, likely 2 and not many auto manufacturers have adapted well to the challenge. The rate of physical recalls is also rather 'burn the house down' obscene."

So of course they are going to be discussed.\n\n2. We got speculative plays that blew up and are growing market share like AMD, TSLA, and NVDA. I would personally argue that the valuations make me not want to touch them. However I can see why these stocks would appeal to people as they are growing earnings like crazy and have the potential of being big blue chip companies.\n\n3. You got risky plays like META, and INTC. Me personally I am not touching them. However once again I can see why they would appeal to some people and be discussed as they are already established companies that make money but are trading at a low valuation due to big earnings loss and short term risk.\n\n4. We got just your standard blue chip dividend companies like JNJ, TGT, KO, PG, PEP, WM, etc. there is nothing really to discuss about these cause they are kind of universal buy and hold companies. They have been around for decades and have been growing stock price and dividends. So I don\u2019t know what is there to discuss except buy and hold. \n\n5. We got penny stocks and I feel like nobody discusses those cause of how much risk is involved in them. Most people on here lets be real have no idea what they are doing. So discussing penny stocks is not really a process and is just mindless speculation.\n\nSo my question to you is which stocks should be discussed?

And mid level companies in China. \nThere will a lot more Tencent and baba coming around but it\u2019s really hard to research them.\n\nAnd the issue with robotics is that the big tech companies are all over this field.

Divide 26B by the number of shares outstanding, 3.468B, and you get an eps of $7.5.\n\nA lot of Tesla's operating margin is a bit illusionary like days payable outstaning being very high for a car maker. Also given the price cuts in China and Europe -  why do you assume they increase their margins. Let's assume 15% operating margins, so 19.5b in operating profits. They can carry some tax from previous years forward, so at a 20% tax rate that is 15.6b in profits, so that is $4.5 EPS -  and that is still assuming they can sell 2.2M cars at 59k (although I still believe they won't). \n\nIf we take my still very opportunistic scenario we have a forward PE of 31. If we take a bit lower selling price or 1.7M cars, that quickly shifts. \n\n>Apple has a forward PE ratio of 19.55. If you are excited to buy Apple at these prices when their -25% off ath, but won't touch Tesla why not?\n\nIT'S A CAR MAKER. They have the expenses of a car maker, they sell cars and make all their money from cars. They are not a technology company. Toyota has a PE of 10 and sells 10m cars a year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla is grossly undervalued, and the market is providing a huge opportunity for those able to keep a level head.\n\nEven at the opportunistic scenario Tesla is overvalued. If we assume 1.7m sold cars and 55k average selling price at 15% operating margin. the valuation becomes a disaster. (deliveries have been flat the last three quarters now)"

By writing such nonsense you are only fueling the thesis of overvalued Tesla.\n\nWhich I don't think is reasonable either. But not while valuing Tesla like that. Rather, I do think the FSD is getting nearer - yes, I know Elon was saying for years \"next year\" or even \"this year\" but let's just ignore that for a moment and focus on the state of FSD beta right now and on the fact that they are going to have very soon a lot more computation resources for neural networks training (DOJO clusters coming up). They were obviously limited in computational power to be able to utilize their vast dataset collected from their growing fleet and now they are going to grow the power by several times. 2023 looks really good in my view when it comes to visible FSD improvements. They should be able to get it to a point where people start to believe it is coming soon. And this should drive the TSLA price way up. I don't know when that will happen but it does look like they are planning an unveiling event for Q1, probably the new robitaxi, without the steering wheel.\n\nObviously now almost no investors price in any of the FSD, which can be seen for example in this thread. I think it's a mistake, FSD should be partially priced in today while valuing Tesla."

     "While there are some natural concerns with any public figure being controversial while owning one of the most talked-about public companies in the world, there is a lot of pessimistic sentiments being made here that are just impossible to predict until there is a clearer picture.\n\n1. Tesla investors can be pissed but the operations of the business is all that matters and right now, it's operating beautifully with/without Musk. Long-term, this is all noise. Literally, no one who is investing in Tesla long-term sees an issue with Twitter because the operations of Tesla will soon be impossible to ignore. Firstly, they are already going to be the most profitable U.S. automaker this year. By the end of next year, they will be the most profitable automaker in the world with a projected $18 billion in net income. Is Twitter really going to come into play here?\n2. Elon didn't cut 'half' of Twitter's engineering staff. Namely, a large % of them were already planned to be laid off before Elon took over. Hence, why Meta is also planning on laying off thousands of workers. It's an industry layoff. In Twitter's case, these workers were not needed because the projects that they had been working on were scrapped, thus, they aren't going to be working on Twitter's future plans. Most people in the tech community will tell you that they haven't been working much while at home. There's a reason... they really aren't adding much value to the overall company. The reason these tech companies hired en masse was to prevent them from going to their competitors in what they expected was going to be an economy largely dominated by people WFH and thus, using their platform more. When that didn't happen, they all started laying off these workers. \n3. Going to your Twitter cash burn, it's true that they lose over $1.3 billion every year. And removing those Twitter employees will cut that amount to $900 million. His initiatives that he plans on pushing out is largely designed to create an alternative source of revenue which in all likelihood, is TBD. He literally took over two weeks ago. I don't see how you can accurately presume that it won't work.\n4. Those people making names to imposter people is going to get fixed real quick. Either way, they are paying $8 just to get banned shortly after. They are trying new methods and there are ways to correct them.\n\nWas Twitter a mistake for Mr. Musk? Yes, probably so. But the verdict on whether he can turn Twitter around is going to require more than two weeks to decide. IMO, there are lots of ideas that are going to be implemented that will positively turn Twitter around. Either way, Tesla on its own is more than capable of operating with or without Musk. I highly doubt Musk's presence is even needed with Tesla right now. There are people who are put in charge who are familiar with how Tesla operates by now."

But that\u2019s overall supply chain.\n\nTo answer your original question. It may very well go down to 620 tomorrow."

Margins get better every year. \n\nCompetitors are coming - VW are the only car company that seems to be taking the EV race seriously. The rest or not making them at a profit or at mass production. \n\nNo demand - Sells every car they can produce. Do not currently advertise. \n\nToo expensive - Already selling as many as the higher cost models they can produce. Will likely introduce more affordable models and reduce current prices once production increases. \n\nRocket man bad - The current administration cares more about swing state votes that climate change which is insulting. \n\nWill not capture the market - The EV pie is growing, especially with these gas prices. Even if Tesla ramps up and competitors make the very expensive transition from ICE to EVs there will still be greater demand than they can meet for years to come. \n\nOvervalued - If a risk or plausible bear case comes up that suggests Tesla cannot continue to ramp then the stock price will respond accordingly. The fact that it\u2019s holding above $600 in this market is very bullish. A company like Toyota isn\u2019t valued as Tesla is because they wont be selling 10m ICE cars in the future. \n\nSo bring on the downvotes.

TSLA is a fine stock at $300-$450 depending on how well things go this coming year.  Even at $620 it is grossly overvalued.   Also, Musk seems to have incited a mutiny amongst many of his employees and a possible boycott amongst his liberal democrat customers.  He is also losing a lot on cryptos and is the target of two shareholder lawsuits for stock and Dogecoin manipulation.  Plus the Twitter deal is not going to happen unless he coughs up the full price which will likely weigh on TSLA shares because he will need to sell more of them or use them as high-risk collateral."

At worst they'll be doing $32B in net income in 2024, at best about $67B. With their current market cap, that would give them a PE between 9 and 20, despite growing earnings around 50% per year.

     "In what world are either of these companies comparable??\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but tesla was trading at something like 25x sales at its peak. To think the stock collapse was not justified reminds me about one of my favorite quotes about valuation \n\n>What were you thinking?!\nScott McNealy was the CEO of Sun Microsystems, one of the darlings of the dot com bubble. At its peak his stock hit valuation of ten-times revenues. A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time:\n\n>At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don\u2019t need any transparency. You don\u2019t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?\n\n\nEven at 5x sales its relatively expensive. These two companies are not comparable"

A car gets you to point a to point b yet people will pay x3 for a BMW or Benz when they could have a reliable Toyota or Honda at a more reasonable price.\n\nThese companies sell an aspiration/lifestyle and have a dedicated customer base. Please don't assume all customers want to buy the cheapest apparel or discount brand. Louis Vuitton has built a financially profitable luxury brand. Apple essentially sells luxury phones.\n\nYou can call these consumers financially irresponsible or dumb but ask yourself, will consumer behavior change anytime soon?"

     "Your point 2 is where all the issue with Tesla is. Human mind will love a product or service based on a holistic image e.g.,  Electric vision. At the same time, the human mind will dissociate with a product or service that is a butt of all jokes. I used to recommend Tesla but don\u2019t anymore to my colleagues. The product has not changed. My attitude has. Tesla is no longer a great car. Too many flaws: build quality, FSD, making them unsafe by removing sensors, Musk only cares for short-term profits, etc. It\u2019s in my mind that I vocalize to others. Humans are not entirely data driven. \n\nPoint 8 (vertical integration) is a strength. \n\nYou missed: Tesla is the most American made car. \n\nDoes it deserve a market cap that\u2019s 1/4th of all auto industry market cap.

     ">I sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again.\n\nThey do. Elon Musk is Tesla. People associate him with them. If he insults the left, which is the primary market of EVs and spouts right wing opinions, those will leave. There is a reason why nearly all CEOs try to be in the shadows and only present a curated version of themselves (Jobs)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn\u2019t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)\n\nHere is where you are wrong. Consumer report has them among the lowest ranking cars in terms of reliability. It is similar to Jeeps and Aston Martin. A specific group loves the car with the flaws - but once they go mainstream they don't. Tesla has now just gone mainstream and you have loads of complaints now. A car is a transportation vehicle. Technology might be cool for the group that used to buy Tesla's (and that now Musk is alienating), but not for the majority of people. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 that has faster charging, cheaper, very close in range (nobody could reproduce Tesla's EPA rating, but from other brands they could) and is more comfortable with better interiors. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!\n\nFirst they do spend on advertising, they literally shot a Tesla into space. In fact they have the most expensive ad department in the world with Elon Musk. Musk cashed out 12b this year alone in stocks. No other company has the insane compensation package for the CEO. Tesla spends the most on advertising of any car company. They just call it compensation package for the CEO. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something \u201cfrivolous\u201d like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly.\n\nThey pay their suppliers 60 days later than most other car companies (Tesla around 82 days DPO - most other are max 30 days). Yes they are profitable now, but they are ramping factories quickly. If demand falls (and we are seeing that - why else would they have discounts in EU, US, China, Canada and Mexico) - then that profitability can quickly turn. Furthermore, FSD is smokes and mirrors and did not deliver what they promised. It could very quickly become a liability, if they have to refund them - and could seriously harm their cash cycle \n\n>Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions.\n\nTesla's cars are priced, because they were the first ones and people tolerated cheap materials for an EV that has high range. Now there are alternatives. There is inventory in the US and Europe now already. Yes they are probably cutting production and are already cutting staff, but they are still valued like the biggest car companies combined. If you stop the growth, they will go back to a more car company like valuation (especially as margins will compress with the discount and less sales). Most car companies trade at 5-8 PE. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes \u201cfat\u201d (ask any body builder). The \u201crecession\u201d is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!\n\nTesla still has not ramped production in two factories. That are huge costs without any proper gain yet. I don't think GE is the example you want to give, given that they had fraudulent numbers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Tesla is more than a car company\u201d. This is a polarizing statement! But let\u2019s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do.\n\nThey don't produce the solar panels - Samsung and Panasonic does. Insurance is a low margin business and I don't see any SaaS (FSD is not a product yet). The company loses money on everything except cars. So they are a car company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple\u2019s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!\n\nWhat? Apple is hugely dependent on Foxconn. That Tesla controls most aspects of production is a positive and a negative. It comes with great margins in good times, but it also comes with worse ones when there is a recession. If a car part maker of VW goes down, they find a new one - but in recessions Tesla will weather all the cost. The dealerships are the same thing. you get the money, but in bad times the price cuts of other car makers influence the dealer margins - not their own, and dealers can make it up in service. \n\nIf you think that Tesla's decision are consumer centric, I advise you to read all the complaints about the service. People don't even get loaners. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Important point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution. Every challenge has been met with bold strategy and then executed to critical success. The team is the same, so why should the results be any different 10 years from now? Elon is one man and sure he may have brain fart from now and then, but the team and culture (results oriented) he has developed for the last 10 years will be the difference maker!\n\nThey literally nearly went bankrupt in 2018 (by Elon's own worlds)and the only reason they did not is because of hype man Elon and a capital raise. Furthermore they sold a huge amount of carbon credits. I give them credit, they managed to make EVs cool, but you can not give them an A for excectuion here.  Regarding culture, I advise you to look at all the racism lawsuits. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest. I\u2019m confident that even in the absence of Elon, there will be a competent leader who take the reins and extract greatness.\n\nWe'll see. \n\n>I\u2019m not going to call Elon a genius yet. But he is operating at much higher scale when compared to everyone else. Setting aside his success with PayPal. To gestate Tesla and at the same time expand into solar & rockets and compete successfully should show you that the man is not normal. And with this, you should expect some level of eccentricity. If not for this eccentricity (his downfall) he would likely rule the world. Be glad that Twitter is the channel for his eccentricities vs Tesla.\n\nElon's x com merged with Confinity  only because they were both losing money. They completely scraped everything Elon did and ousted him as CEO. He literally lucked his way into Paypal. Yes he used government subsidies to create his companies. I give him credit to make EVs cool, but nothing more. \n\nGood luck with your investment. Just for your information. Tesla is still worth more than VW+Toyota+Ford+GM."

     "Point 1 - Starting before Twitter, Elon launched an effort to piss off liberals and progressives while trying to appeal to the \"Fox News is too liberal\" crowd. How many of his new demographic are trading in their F150 for a Model Y? vs how many liberals and progressives now don't want to be seen driving something associated with Elon?\n\nPoint 2 is simply wrong. I drove a P100D ($160k car) for 9 months while my car was getting a new battery, new AC compressor, and new tire sensors. A day after it rained I got in the car drove up my driveway, put my foot on the brake, and water dumped all over my feet (inside the car). I drove to work with wet socks. That was one of a long list of quirks and issues. I ended up asking myself \"if this car was $50k would I buy it\"... I concluded no,\n\nOn the plus side they do make money on servicing. After quoting ~$600 to replace the 4 tire pressure sensors they billed me nearly $2000 for that line item."

     "Let\u2019s take this another way and look at the competition. I feel like most bears here aren\u2019t in tune with the current state of the EV market. I encourage bears to read some threads in r/electricvehicles. \n\nLots of people want a different option than a Tesla but end up going with a Tesla anyway. Why? The lack of charging infrastructure and the dealership model are the two huge factors that has kept the competition behind Tesla.\n\nSo far, the competition\u2019s biggest plus is being able to offer a lower cost vehicle with stats that got somewhat close to Teslas. Particularly with the $7,500 credit for foreign manufacturers such as Kia/Hyundai while Tesla got none for the past few years However that will change in 2023. Another downside is they don\u2019t produce enough volume which means large wait times and being priced above MSRP by dealers.\n\nIn 2023, if you\u2019re buying from a competitor, you\u2019re:\n\n\u2022\t\u2060not getting the $7,500 credit (unless GM/Ford)\n\n\u2022\t\u2060not getting access to a reliable charging network\n\n\u2022\t\u2060going to have to endure the dealership experience\n\n\u2022\t\u2060paying above MSRP\n\n\u2022\t\u2060having to wait a long time for delivery\n\nOnce these things become evident to EV shoppers, it\u2019s gonna be really tough to not buy a Tesla. Even if it\u2019s not your top choice. Even if you don\u2019t like Elon. Virtue signaling is easy when it\u2019s free (online opinions) but it\u2019s hard when you gotta pay for it.\n\nEdit: for US market only."

     "1. Whiney pathetic liberal sheep ARE shying away from Elon because he is leaning Republican and their sheepish feelings have been bruised.\n\n2. Tesla does make great cars, but so do Mercedes, BMW, and Porsche\n\n3. Tesla will need to start advertising now that they are no longer the only lectric car on the market. This will eat into their margins.\n\n4. Other car companies are also profitable especially companies like Stelantis which has really solid financial fundementals.\n\n5. The supply of electric cars is being increased by other entrants into the lectric car market and companies like Ford, BMW, and Mercedes also have their respective fan boys\n\n6. At some point companies must transition from high growth to long term value. Exponential growth is not sustainable.\n\n7. The narrower the focus, the stronger the brand. Tesla may be better served by spinning off some of the other business units from the car company.\n\n8. Vertical integration has its pros and cons. Steve Jobs said if you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far go as a team.\n\n9. The rise has certainly been meteoric.\n\n10. That remains to be seen. Elon is the single most critical point of failure. He will be hard to replace. Tesla as a company does not yet have the track record of a company like Ford that has survived the great depression, two world wars, foreign competition, the financial collapse, etc.\n\n11. He never struck me as a genius just very logical and practical. Fossil fuels are the rarest, dirtiest, most dangerous form of solar energy in the universe.\n\nElon understood that it takes energy about 8 minutes to reach the earth from the sun and it can be captured and used almost immediately without the need to wait millennia for it to be converted into oil, coal, or natural gas. That's not genius that's just being practical."

Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).\r  \n\r  \nIt operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).\r  \n\r  \nIt does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.\r  \n\r  \nDespite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).\r  \n\r\r  \n\rAll this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history."

     "I am a software engineer and lately I\u2019ve been doing data science things. My employer says I\u2019m a data scientist but I don\u2019t really agree. But I do do a little bit of that as part of my job. In my relatively short time (1 year) doing ML/AI/data science things for my job, it seems to me that while all theoretically possible, the tools to get to things like self-driving cars don\u2019t exist in the same way that tools for making an iOS app exist. Also, you can Google how to make an iOS app all day long, but in my day to day work I find it\u2019s common to just not find anything on the internet about what I\u2019m trying to build or do with ML/AI. \n\nI think it\u2019s only a matter of time before Teslas really do drive themselves without any sort of disclaimer or asterisk attached. \n\nPart of it is in software as much as we try, we can\u2019t always find all the bugs before going to production and releasing code to the users\u2026 and that\u2019s for web apps. To thoroughly test Autopilot\u2026 I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s realistic. I think there will be more Autopilot crashes/cases where it didn\u2019t do what it was expected or supposed to do. Is what it is. Airplanes took a few decades of disaster before all the kinks were worked out. At this point, if a commercial plane crashes it\u2019s almost certainly pilot error. Pilots (people) fly planes, and people write software like Autopilot. We aren\u2019t perfect so Autopilot won\u2019t be either, for a time anyway.\n\nAlso, people like to wax about how TSLA is worth X because they have the largest network of charging stations in the US. That\u2019s definitely worth something, but even more so is the IP that is Autopilot. Ford and others will spend TRILLIONS building their own self-driving hardware and software, and those will all have accidents too, unless Tesla decides to sell the Autopilot tech, but that doesn\u2019t seem likely."

     "Maybe a bad press week, but the reality is this company is light years ahead of the competition.  The charging network is the strategic advantage - just as iTunes was (and now the App Store) is Apples strategic advantage.  Prior to iPod there were dozens (maybe hundreds) of MP3 players, but grandma wasn\u2019t about to go to a Russian website for free music and then figure out how to get it on the device.  iTunes made it easy to get tunes and apps in one place and it just works with iPod/iPhone/iPad.  If you haven\u2019t got an EV today, you have no idea what the difference is finding charging for an non-Tesla EV vs a Tesla.  With Tesla, I show up and plug in.  With other networks, I need a special app to find a charger, another app to start /pay for the charging, and (assuming the station actually works) I likely have to have an adapter.  It\u2019s a major pain in the ass that Ford/GM/Toyota/etc won\u2019t invest in until it\u2019s much too late/expense to catch up anytime soon."

Musk is too smart to believe that Trump is innocent so he has started becoming a fascist, not just a republican. He is down with Bolsonaro in Brazil now, and it is NOT to save the rain forest it is to confab with a fellow fascist.

Just a simple investor.\n\nThis has nothing to do with investing. Sounds like you're either a trader, or more likely a gambler.\n\nAs for what Tesla should be worth, price targets are difficult right now, both because of changing market conditions and the fact that Tesla is still growing extremely fast, making fair PE and PEG ratios difficult to determine. But I'm expecting Tesla to do ~$4.7B in Q3 and $5-6B in Q3, which would put the full year's earnings at $14.2B-15.2B or\n\nLet's say a fair PE on that would be between the current 72 and 50, and a fair PEG would be between 0.5 and 1. That would put the valuation between $710B and $1,094B, or between $1,121B and $2,640 respectively.\n\nSo a price target for FY 2022  would probably be somewhere in the $900B-$1,200B range after Q4 earnings are announced (February).

     "Comments like this show a clear misunderstanding of what the market is and what stocks are and how they function. During Nov 2021 google was a $150 stock. It then lost about 40% of its valuation over a period of about 1.5 years because of a combination of many macro economic factors with inflation being the biggest one. There were serious fears of runaway inflation during that time. Russia invaded Ukraine causing oil price shocks. Did you forget about all these MACRO events that occurred during that time? \n\nBut what actually changed for Google? Not much. Was the 40% drop warranted? It depended on what happened. If inflation would have gotten worse and the economy tipped into a serious recession then yes. But it didn\u2019t. The job market held strong. Inflation is now cooling off so we are seeing a resurgence of buying in large cap stocks. \n\nSee the problem is that you forget your history already.

Google started up Google Brain (Their internal AI division) in 2011.\n2. Google acquired DeepMind in 2014. At this time, DeepMind was their No.1 competitor in AI.\n3. Google announced they are an \"AI First\" company in 2017, even though they'd been AI first since at least 2014 (year of the DeepMind acquisition)\n4. Google Brain publishes a whitepaper on \"transformer networks\". This is the underlying technology that's powering ChatGPT4. In fact, ask Sam Altman about it. He'll tell you that ChatGPT4, or ChatGPT anything, wouldn't actually exist if it wasn't for Google's in-house ML engineers that released that whitepaper.\n5. Microsoft has been an \"AI First\" company for maybe two years tops? I know their investment in OpenAI was July 2019, but that was more of a dipping their toes in the water moment than anything.\n6. Google employed thousands of ML/AI engineers across all their divisions as far back as 2014. Microsoft maybe had a hundred (if even that) ML/AI engineers in 2014?\n7. Sergey Brin and Larry Page have recently come out of \"retirement\" to help steward the merger of Google Brain and DeepMind into a singular unit within Google. The ultimate AI brain trust.\n8. LLM's (Large Language Models) aren't the alpha and omega of AI advancement. It's just one small aspect of the overall AI field.\n9. Bard might be FAR behind ChatGPT4 as a LLM, but we don't know with any certainty that Google doesn't have something far more advanced than Bard that they simply don't intend to reveal to the public anytime soon. Remember, Google Brain has been banging away since 2011 and DeepMind has been banging away as a member of Google since 2014."

It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and its causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, its short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. \\n\\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe its stress maybe hes actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, Ill leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if thats actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm.

     "What you said about luxury goods performing well in recessions is pretty inaccurate particularly at scale. The 50k car purchase is exactly the kind of thing a upper middle class person would postpone if they\u2019re concerned with the economy and potentially getting laid off. Additionally how many more rich people can buy a new Tesla every year that\u2019s inherently diminishing year after year. I would also argue that the upper class is more likely to stockpile cash and buy appreciating assets during a recession than buy a depreciating one. Making financially smart decisions is probably somewhat correlational with being upper class.\n\nFurthermore with higher interest rates auto loans are more of a risk and with potential defaults lenders will have stricter standards with lending which would reduce the pool of buyers. In short there\u2019s a lot of macro reasons why growth will not be 100% this year and Elon himself has alluded to that in recent earnings which is a big reason the stock has fallen."

It's pure shit and even if market goes up and tesla along with it's probably just breaking the fall. \nSo Tesla is just like a good stock with some leverage that makes it untradable trash.

But with the stock having fallen for 8 of the last 10 weeks and now trading at 2-year lows, is all the negative news is priced in? \\n\\nDespite briefly dipping below, TSLA did close above support coming from the August 2020 highs at 167.50. This level may have added significance from a technical standpoint, as the breakout in November 2020 is what took the stock into \"new-high\" territory. Buyers may therefore eye this level as a good area for accumulation which could help the stock form a base, or even begin a rebound if longer-term investors also look to add to their positions. \\n\\nOf course, all trading carries risk, and TSLA could continue to struggle as the fundamental backdrop for the company, as well as the broader market, remain relatively bearish.'",

But all in all, the stock is up 15x from when I first bought it, and TSLA has brought me financial security. So many people thought it was over-priced then, and so many people think it\u2019s over-priced now. Downvote me all you want, bears \ud83d\udc3b \n\nI totally agree those saying that if it\u2019s important to you for to be profitable on TSLA within the next 1-3 years, then don\u2019t trade it. Only invest what you can in TSLA, hoping it will rocket soon, but be willing to wait several years if your money temporarily gets cut in half. I\u2019ve had my money cut in half again & again on the TSLA ride.\n\nI\u2019d recommend watching some [Tesla Daily](https://m.youtube.com/c/TeslaDaily). It\u2019s a very well-researched look at the company, and has shown itself to be quite accurate over the years."

     "Everything these days are idiotic and it's because of runaway money printing. Valuations are ridiculous for everything from stocks, to housing, to doge coins. Tax paying no longer matters because the government can simply print more money when they run out. Who is dumb enough to buy treasury bonds when you know 10 years later they hold half the value and pay shit in dividends. So people are taking more risk to buy stocks and who cares if it's a company that generates 1/10th the revenue but have 10x the market cap. Stocks are now valued based on popularity or something else. \n\nCryptocurrencies are idiotic as well. They're only used as a mean for the rich to hedge the money they conned off of the middle and lower class. There is no incentives for the average person to be miners because your chance of being awarded a bitcoin or any coin is practically 0. So much for decentralizing money. The mining rigs consume more energy than two refrigerators and loud  AF. It's expensive as hell to buy and if you get fished or forgot your password or broke your wallet, it is lost to the ether. An idiotic way to hedge inflation but there's fewer alternatives. \n\nThen you have a fundamental investor like Warren Buffet saying gold, which has been used for millenniums, has little use. \n\nThen you have over priced housing thanks to Trump unemployment money. A $300 grand house get you a new home with basic cheap everything. Then they drive up the demand because investors are just putting down 5% on a house and buying 5 of them to rent out. \n\nF the idiotic money printing. F the idiocy in the world. It's just people conning other people to get rich."

     "My take on TSLA\u2026 first and foremost, I honestly believe it\u2019s not going anywhere and in 10 years it will remain a top 5 US company. All of this being said, I don\u2019t know that it will stay Top 5 on the way there. Yeah I know\u2026 it\u2019s not just a car company, it\u2019s AI, solar, energy, robotaxis, robots, insurance, you name it. The fact remains that today it\u2019s 95% a car company that sells only 2 real cars, plus a handful of S and X vehicles. All other aspects of their business are either pipe dreams, years away from solo profitability, or regulatory nightmares. The long game is probably quite strong for Tesla but the short game is tough. The way I look at it, it\u2019s about a $900B company today, let\u2019s ask what needs to happen to get it to $2T? I think a lot needs to go right over the next 5 years to get there. I think it does get to $2T or even $3T over time, but what is that time and risk worth for 2-3x upside that isn\u2019t guaranteed. Let me give you a real world example. I\u2019ve been heavy in Apple for a very long time. When they were a $1T company I sold a solid chunk of shares and diversified out into a lot of safer bets. Today Apple is a $3T company and those investments are up about 75% being diversified out. Would I have made more staying put? Sure but the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Not sure how much of your portfolio is in Tesla at $1100, but if it\u2019s more than 20%, maybe consider why."

Stock price is not solely based on intrinsic value of course but in the highly volatile (dare I say bearish) market that we are bound to be in for the first half of this year it is a good indicator of how a stock price might perform. If you can hold for the long term (1+ years) then I would say go for it, you will probably make money (especially if Tesla does a split which will certainly drive up the stock price).  If you can\u2019t buckle up and hold for over a year then you might as well sell. We are not in a good market for growth stock right now and it\u2019s a total gamble trying to predict if things will get better or worse in the near future with everything going on. Good luck!"

I was in that situation once and sold shares in my winners to cover a margin call due to a stock that was getting hammered. It was touch and go for a week but the hammered stock came back and I'm glad I held it. My winners I sold to cover margin call also dropped after I sold and I was able to buy back for about 10% less.  This was during the covid drop. I was down to $189k from $750k and on margin call. By shuffling stocks I got through it and up to $890k now.  Lesson learned. I never go that deep in margin now. About 50% cash now waiting for Russia war crash to play out and get back in.     As far As TSLA I stay away at these prices. I feel TSLA is priced like they are the only EV play there is. All car companies going EV and theri share prices are all too high due to the EV bubble. As far as I see they are all double where they should be. Several small EV companies are in play too now. Due to the competition and low profit on EVs I have no doubt sales of EVs will be high but profits will be low. If TSLA thinks they have the market to themselves they are mistaken. GM and Ford are coming up strong.  When I buy my first EV it will be GM or Ford. My fun EV will be a corvette or mustang. At some point TSLA will crash like FB. Right now TSLA is priced like they are the only EV maker in the world and all other car makers will do gas cars forever."

Tesla has never, not even back when it was $100 just before it shot up to $900, looked this appealing. The risk/reward at the current valuation is insane. Imo the risk it goes down throughout this decade is close to 0, the chance it goes at least 3x is extremely large, there's still a very fair chance it goes 10x and if all the crazy AI stuff (FSD/Tesla bot/Autobidder/Dojo) works out the upside is unimaginable.\n\nAll of that said, this is the risk of using margin. Your decision is not whether you should sell Tesla, but whether you should continue to be on margin. That has nothing to do with the company and everything to do with the meta and your mental wellbeing, and is exactly the reason why you should never use margin for (long term) investing."

The question now is whether the price reflects a fair value that you should pay for that business.\n\nDespite the YoY revenue declines, I think once the economy emerges the other side of this inflation battle, that downtrend will have been temporary. However I do think this stock is being priced to perfection, and the expected growth argument I've seen from multiple bulls is that this price action brings it into line with other big Tech (P/E in the 25 region or so). This growth argument is expecting all of the chips falling Nvidia's way (excuse the pun) over the medium term which in my view is highly optimistic. I can see this stock pulling back back but I think the days of this being a below $200 stock may be over unless economic shit hits the fan."

     "I've been buying Nvidia pretty consistently from 2020 till end of 2022.  I haven't bought more this year.  I view it as 10 year investment horizon, and I didn't really care what financials looked like.  I believe in the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/5-stages-of-the-hype-cycle) idea.  During that time period, I also worked for a VC growth accelerator program; so I'm biased to ideas that I've seen pitched.  But the new markets created that benefits Nvidia:\n\n* Generative AI (current hype wave), AND I also think there will 'Models-As-A-Service' that will likely emerge that will disrupt current SAAS businesses (future hype train)\n* Metaverse (current Trough of Disillusion).  As generative AI gets easier and better (art then video then 3D objects); then Metaverse can happen.  It's no secret even way back then, that Apple was also looking into the space.\n* Crypto-Blockchain -  (current Trough of Disillusion); another big bull run will eventually happen within the next 10 years.\n* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.\n* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.\n* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    \n\nI don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen."

More AI developers use their GPUs and software toolkits than any other, by a wide margin.\n\nThe dominant leader in a market tends to support inflated valuations for extended periods of time.\n\nUntil recently we would never imagine Google losing its dominance in the search market. The lead that Amazon has in being a global marketplace is practically insurmountable. Say what you want about Tesla and competition, but they have an insurmountable lead in software development and the vast amounts of data required to cement their leadership.\n\nThese \"cream of the crop\" companies are rare and every institution wants to hold them.\n\nIs Nvidia \"overvalued?\" Sure. It was probably overvalued at $300. And it will be overvalued at $500 later this year.\n\nThe market decides the value of a stock. The more we get hung up on questioning the rationality of the market, the more we miss opportunities. History shows again and again, long-term market leaders had inflated valuations *before* they made their big runs."

We will be seeing lot of upgrades from analysts in coming days. I am still puzzled as to how this was already not priced on with almost 100% run in last 6 months alone. Now stock is up another 26%.\\n\\nAmazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.\\n\\nCan someone help me understand how NVDA has such a low short interest at these level? And literally everyone thinks this all makes sense? (Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time. At least for TSLA when it went on this insane run, there was lot of short interest, then S&P 500 inclusion hype, stock split, EV demand surge and 0% interest rate. \\n\\nTrying to figure ou'",

     "It's just dumb to short NVDA because at best it's a great company that's overvalued. TSLA was literally going bankrupt a few years back, so it's not really a fair comparison.\n\nAnd while I'd argue it's massively overvalued relative to other tech valuations, it's probably not that overvalued if you believe they can achieve 50% growth rates for several years while maintaining 30-40% net profit margins. In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.\n\nI think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.\n\nPersonally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price. With lots of companies now beginning to build their own AI-optimised chips I worry whether NVDA can defend their margins. If they execute well I think they probably can, but when you have a stretched valuation that's not really good enough."

Crazy because the vacuum powered train concept is about 100 years old but he was going around acting like he came up with the concept.

It'll be a while before we need it, so I thought- what the hell- I should be able to make a quick buck instead of just leaving it in savings.  I deposited it to my brokerage account and I tried to buy 225 shares of TSLA at $1,115 or so thinking it would go back to $1200 in no time.  My broker blocked the sale because of the waiting period before I could use the funds.  I watched as the price went up a little bit so I was pissed.. then I watched it go down and down and down.. so even thought I could trade, I waited instead.  \\n\\nTLTR: My broker saved me from at least a $60k error because I couldn't use the funds when I wanted to.\"",

I have my rules for buying/selling Tesla and I'm never put in a situation where I must give up my shares. \n\nBottom line, I look at everything from a rules-based and LONG term perspective and work within that framework. Looking at month to month, or in this case day to day movement of an inherently irrational market won't do you or anyone any favors."

That's why he took several gambles along the way to scale up fixed costs (Austin, Berlin, Shanghai) in order to enable much higher production.  He has famously spent almost nothing on advertising, and they have not refreshed their vehicle models very much which keeps fixed investments very low.\n\nRegarding \"AI\" (or more specifically LLM AI), the thought is that with enough capex in LLM's, there will be new markets opened for generative AI to displace existing services (search and advertising) or human workers."

He said something to the effect of despite all the hype, he forgot that at the end of the day, it's still retail which has terrible margins.\n\nI think that's the main issue with businesses like uber, you can slap the tech label on it but In the end the base business (a taxi/delivery service) is not an infinitely scalable high margin business"

They don't only have the most popular web site there ever has been in history by a lot.\n\nBut then Google has the second most popular web site in history.    That is almost unfair.\n\nThen Google has 16 different services that have over a billion active users.   That is just insane.\n\nIt does not leave much for the newer companies.   Take OTT in the US.  Google entered the market and took the lead pretty quickly and is now pulling away."

It is now cheaper to take a cab, although the Ubers are usually nicer than the cabs, and ordering an Uber is easier than getting a cab. \nSince I quit drinking, the only time I use Uber is when I travel out of town, like when I went to Chicago in February. We took 5 rides that weekend. Really no other reason for me to use it. I went from using it couple times a month, to a few times a year. As to the cost, my special needs adult son had a job that was less than 4 miles from our house. Earlier this year, I got him an uber to come home on a Thursday at 8 pm, and it was $38 dollars, more than he made working that day. A few years ago, I took an Uber over 40 miles to Nashville for less than $50 at 5 pm on a Thursday."

     "No worries, it was all completely fake.  MAGMA Tech stocks are boomer stocks and only the dying boomers are pumping them for the sake of exit liquidity.  Wait for the crash and I assure you you'll find great companies that become innovative with truly new ideas that can replace the productivity of millions of workers.  It happens when stock prices are challenged quite considerably, which is not right now.  The current line up of tech companies are just gimmicks that on the contrary have technology that is quite old at this point.  Since these old blue chip tech stocks haven't brought anything new to the table they are no different at this point then a common crypto shit coin, essentially they are just stores of value, favorites of investors maybe, but nothing more.  To be fair the value is backed by profits, but the growth forecasts are all unrealistic and they will all fail or be replaced by foreign competitors before they will grow enough to pay back current lofty share prices which in some of these companies cases mean they would need to make profits for 60 years straight just to justify current share prices. (they are quite lofty and the world would in no universe grow that fast) The world isn't growing fast enough for their growth to justify their prices and it's that simple, and the next decade will likely be a continuation of highly competitive asset classes that will pull money from these companies market caps as higher interest rates become impossible to be put back into the box.  That's the thesis and I'm sticking to it."

     "Assuming Tesla grows EPS 15% q/q from Q421-Q322, which I think is very conservative (Q421 should land around $2.5) their current forward P/E at the time of me posting this is around 74. Still very expensive relative to its tech peers, but also growing faster than any of them objectively. Could be another bargain if Tesla delivers on its promise of \"50% growth for years to come\" or could be a disaster if they are unable to scale due to sanctions/china relations, continued chip shortage leading to lower growth than promised, Elon retiring which would all undoubtedly crash the stock back to \"normal\" valuations. I bought in at 900 on December 20th and am only adding from here.   \n\n\n2020 taught me a valuable lesson to follow the fundamentals instead of following short term macroeconomics. I sold everything that March and bought everything back at higher prices later. I think Tesla continues to dominate scale and efficiency over the foreseeable future while expanding margins HEAVILY. Even if level 5 autonomy never work out, 15% of Tesla owners will absolutely pay $200/month for level 4 autonomy. How soon that comes is TBD, but having followed it very closely since Beta released, the software improvements are translating to better real world results at what should be an alarming pace to other FSD competitors. The second it comes to wide release for $200/month, its immediate and substantial impact to EPS will be felt in a sharp move upward imo.  \n\n\nTLDR - Tesla is printing money while expanding revenues faster than any of its tech peers. If you don't like volatility don't get in on it, but if you want to long it, do it now and don't think twice."

     "This sub hates Tesla. Don't expect anything but negative comments towards TSLA. I'm all in TSLA + 25% margin. I used more margin to buy 10 shares today.  \n\nIf I told you there was a company who sold 1 million \"things\" for an average price of 50k with 30% margins and growing 50% a year. That's an amazing business. \n\nTesla operating income is fixed. As they build more factories - each additional car they sell will grow their margins even more. With FSD + new factories, I can see TSLA hitting 35%+ margins (iphones are like 40% margins) by 2024. \n\nTheres no doubt that TSLA will be the most valuable company. Apple doesn't even manufacturer their own phones. \n\nPeople will always be critical of what they dont understand. \n\nHere's a CNBC clip from today \n\nhttps://youtu.be/6GCJ0CHY268"

     "Here's the issue. Their earnings do not justify their stock price. Period. \n\nIf the fan brand effect were to disappear Tesla stock would be worth significantly less. Been a while since I did my analysis but I would have to compare them to their nearest direct competitors, ie Ford, Toyota, etc. Start there for value.\n\nWhat's their earnings per share vs stock price add in value for anticipated growth in market share for TSLA vs their competitors, ie. New products coming out, performance of exiting products vs competitors,  And subtract any supply issues anticipated that might stymie growth or market factors that they have no control over. Ie changing government regulations that remove some of their ability to sell fuel credits to competitors. \n\nThen arrive at the approximate market vale of a stock for said company. It's probably similar to Toyotas value but possibly slightly higher due to anticipation if them stealing future market share. But since they don't have a truck or a cargo van and there's no reason to expect they will anytime soon. It places TSLA at an extreme disadvantage currently in the vehicle marketplace. \n\nWant me to like them better, com out with a cargo van to replace the Mercedes sprinter for Amazon's fleet. Come out with a pragmatic pickup truck. Come out with a semi. TSLA has big dreams but moves so slowly at achieving them that all of their competitors are bringing electric vehicles to market faster than TSLA can just produce the couple cars they currently make. By the time they do come out with a semi Mercedes will own the electric semi space making competition more difficult. They'll have to fight for market share. The cybertruck is DOA. TSLA doesn't seem to understand the truck marketplace. Or the need for modular customizability of truck beds to fit multiple purposes or the need for various engine sizes. Yes they have multiple motors but they're the wrong sizes. They need direct competitors with ford f150, f250,f350,f450,etc. \n\nBut what they have is a hermaphrodite 150/250. Completely ignoring the workplace setting for these trucks by preventing the truck bed from being removed so that trailers can be hauled or work toolbox or flatbeds can be used. \n\nTSLA thinks they're a consumer product. That wrong idea is making them waste time producing a consumer product. \n\nTrucks are b2b products that many people also use as personal vehicles for economic reasons. If they're not modular tsla will give away truck marketshare to everyone else because tslas leader has never used a truck to work he didn't really \"get\" why they were used or what they're used for. \n\nFord lives or dies by the F150. TSLA could have given them a run for their money. But TSLAs vision is flawed. It's wrong. I anticipate a complete failure for the cybertruck. \n\nHe's a decade away from being a competitive vehicle company with a product in each category. Longer still for the truck category because Elon musk doesn't seem to understand the consumer base. I would subtract estimated future value from TSLA because of how much nonsense the cybertruck design showed. Elon musk needs to stop trying to make something flashy and instead make something thats so pragmatic the world asks why we haven't done it this way yet. Rivian gets it way more. Their modular skateboard design is a masterclass in efficiency of manufacturing. Where's this genius at in TSLA? It's all being used to make flashy TED talks. Rivian has their own problems and areoiced too high for it to become a mainstream product. But they clearly understand the truck consumer better than TSLA. \n\nTSLA didn't even seem to ask what people want from a truck. They just recreated the Dilorean and put i a lift kit. When why they needed was stock tool beds or flat bed configurations. Motor assemblies / chassis that made them direct competitors with the f150s, 259s, 350s, etc. \n\nIs he doing well so far? Yeah, does TSLA deserve to be the world's exponentially most expensive car stock?  Fuck no. Ten years from now if their stock price isn't aooixmiately equal to Toyotas I still will think it's overvalued. \n\n$197.00 per share is Toyotas current stock price. Let's start with TSLA at around this. Now attribute the approximate percentage of that that they earn from sedans and minivans. This is tslas approximate value starting point. \n\nWhen they grow into a full sized vehicle not car company a vehicle company. Will reassess."

They are doing too many great things with robotics and manufacturing, taking risks that seem to be paying off so far, and really could be a very different company in 5 years.

In 2022 they will be growing their profits by ~100% and by over 50% for the forceable future (without Robotaxis and Robots).\n\nPeter Lynch, who I am sure you are familiar with, used the PEG to identify if a company was undervalued. Any stock with a PEG (PE/G) less than 1 is undervalued in his mind. Things have changed a fair bit since then as we are in a low interest rate environment. \n\nThe S&P 500 PEG was around 2 last I checked. Companies like Apple were above that. If you were to calculate Tesla PEG (80/100) it is <1. Again, without any of the Robotaxis and Robot value built in.\n\nSo when you invest in Tesla at these prices you are getting a company that is undervalued in relation to the S&P500 and other tech giants and you get a free call option on Robotaxis and Robots if they occur in the future."

How many times have we heard that in the last 10 years? \n\nLet's look at the numbers. \n\nTesla sold over 900,000 Model 3 and Model Y in 2021. They will probably make 1,600,000 Model 3 and Y this year. \n\nHere is how the competition did in 2021:\n\nUS EV leader GM sold 26.00.000 EV in Q4. Bolt is discontinued. \n\nFord sold 27k Mach E in US despite its released around the same time as Model Y. Worldwide, Ford produced 60,000 Mach E (Ford doesn't breakdown how many are sold, which is quite suspicious).\n\nOh how about Europe? I heard VW is the absolute leader. Well, worldwide, VW sold 200,000 ID 3 and ID4 in 2021. It's a respectable number but nowhere close to what Tesla did. For the whole VW group, they sold around 400,000 EV. Again, pretty good. But not close. \n\nHow about the Chinese? Isn't Tesla being destroyed by China's big 3? \n\nNo. Tesla sold over 450,000 cars in China in 2021. Nio, Li Auto and Xpeng sold less than 100k each. Tesla outsold China's big three combined. \n\nThe competition is coming. They did come. But it doesn't make a difference."

Competition does not have this manufacturing advantage. They don't have in house 4680 battery cells or structural battery pack. They are so far behind right now and they don't have the engineers to catch up. They can MAYBE start to catch up in sales as a group, but margin? No way.

     "First of all, I\u2019d like to point out there\u2019s only one Wall Street analyst with a price target as low as yours, and they all do much more extensive modeling and plenty of them are bearish and/or dislike Tesla and the hype surrounding it. \n\nNow, let\u2019s get specific. Your problem is that you assumed that Tesla would grow revenue 26% per year and profit 29% per year (much lower than what they are guiding for, but ok) through 2030 and still get a P/E of 15? That\u2019s ridiculously low for that level of growth. AMZN P/E is around 74 ($3,100 divided by $41.91 EPS excluding one time Rivian stock gain) for lower levels of growth. And before you pull the \u201cbut it\u2019s an automotive company\u201d bullshit, think for a second. Tesla already has the highest net income margin in the automotive business and still expanding, has virtually no debt, and has been able to grow faster than any other automotive company. Nothing about Tesla\u2019s business fundamentals says it\u2019s a traditional auto, and it should not be valued as such. You will never see Tesla at 15 P/E this decade.\n\nYour other problem is assuming flat net income margin through 2030. Tesla has shown incredible and consistent operating leverage (meaning operating expenses grow more slowly than revenue/gross profit) hence their constant margin expansion over the last couple years. This is probably your most bearish assumption. \n\nOverall, your assumptions are just very, very bearish relative to the current reality right now.\n\nBy the way, your $287 price target represents a trailing 12 month P/E of only 59, and a forward P/E of <24. It\u2019s stupid low for a company that will grow revenue >50% this year and earnings by ~150%."

     "Interesting analysis, but there are a lot of logical fallacies clouding the conclusion. Just to name a few:\n\n* You pretended like a PE of 15 would rich for Tesla's automotive department because its peers are averaging around a PE of 10, but all these other automotive companies have much lower margins and significant bankruptcy risks, and they haven't shown a capability to produce EVs profitably yet. A PE of 15 for a company with Tesla's margins is quite low.\n* You're using margins comparable to today for 2030, despite Tesla heavily investing in new factories without utilizing their economies of scale yet. I believe 13% is an extreme bear case for Tesla's margins in 2030, not a bull case.\n* You're forecasting the automotive market based on numbers during a pandemic and loads of supply chain issues. It's not reasonable to expect a 25% drop in annual sales just because the last two years have been troubled by lockdowns, logistical and supply chain issues. Especially with EVs becoming cheaper than comparable ICE vehicles, it's much more realistic to forecast a slight increase in sales compared to pre-COVID, to around 90-100M a year.\n* You're forecasting Tesla's market share based on a time period where they are building two new factories that will each build more cars than their two current factories combined. You say their market share probably peaked, but it very easily could be going up again once Berlin and Texas open up, as these factories will bring Tesla's installed capacity to somewhere in the 5M a year range as they ramp up.\n* You're comparing ASP's of ICE cars with EVs. That makes no sense, as EVs have much lower cost of ownership and people are willing to pay a bit more today to save a lot in the future. Especially when taking into account car leasing where you don't pay that extra amount up front but do enjoy the lower recurring costs. Factoring in inflation, I think $50K ASPs may be a little on the low end.\n\nTaking just these five points, if we forecast the automotive market to increase to 100M, with Tesla having a 18% market share with ASP's of $55K, margins of 20% and a PE of 20 (remember you said you were talking about the bull case, not a base case), we're already at 100M * 0.18 * 55,000 * * 0.2 * 20 = $3,960,000,000,000 or roughly $4T or about $4,000 per share.\n\nSo to say that $287 is a BULL target in 2030, even if you're just looking purely at the automotive business and ignoring everything else including their car software, is simply not realistic."

Humanoid AI robot - Tesla can already navigate the real world with a car, doing so with two legs will take only a little effort from here. Other robotics efforts have not had this before and ultimately are in perpetual model making mode. This slowly replaces all human labor. Then ai software as a service - this could start making more and more business decisions and slowly start running all companies. This stuff won't fit well into your charts which is why you came up with a obsurdly low PT. Financials will be insane and if your not in, you will miss the best investment opportunity of a century."

They are still happening but FSD will be solved it's only a matter of time. Certainly before 2025. Once it is complete majority of cars they've already made will be able to use it. Some might require upgrade to chips but if the car has cameras it will be able to use it. That's a huge potential fleet.

There is no more room in big business to rest on your laurels, and the companies who have done that for decades without improving margins, making significant technological improvements, or taking big risks are getting left in the dust.\n\nTesla may not hit all the targets expected. But there will be new targets we can't foresee at the moment. A company like Tesla only comes around once in a while, where creativity and risk-taking is promoted. That is worth a hell of a lot."

     "This is much better analysis than Tesla critics typically do, so well done at making things precise. As a gesture of recognition from the dark side, I want to point out two broad points that I think you're missing.\n\nOne, you're not recognizing the category difference between a Tesla vehicle and other vehicles. This leads you to putting Tesla vehicles into buckets where they don't belong. People that would normally buy nothing more than a used Prius are paying $30k-$40k more for a Tesla, without hesitation. Tesla's cars are in a different category the way the iPhone was in a different category from feature phones. But making this precise is like trying to pin down the difference between the food at two different restaurants. There's no real proper language for doing such a thing. If it's not obvious to you from just visiting Tesla's website, then you should regard it as a blind spot that you have. This blind spot is by far the biggest reason short sellers have lost so much money in the company's history.\n\nAnd to be clear, this doesn't have anything to do with the EV component. A car such as the Mach e, which is a great first generation EV by Ford, is not in the same category as a Tesla. Ford's next generation products will be better, and eventually Tesla's competitors will make something in roughly the same category as a Tesla, but it may take until 2025 or beyond. The timeline to watch is how long it takes the industry's software systems to shift away from the decentralized, outsourced, difficult-to-coordinate model to one which is more centralized and vertically integrated, something which is currently completely unnatural to the industry. As someone with an understanding of software, you probably understand the advantage Tesla has as a company which develops their entire software stack, vs an industry which regards components as impenetrable black boxes. Consider the implications of this for over-the-air updates, for example. Of course there are pros and cons to these different approaches, but the pros go to Tesla at this stage in the game.\n\nSecond, you're looking at Tesla in isolation and not taking into account large-scale issues that will affect the automotive industry as a whole. The current ICE industry sells cars at certain prices. These prices are based on a gigantic global machine called the auto industry. This machine requires certain volumes to function properly. If the ICE industry permanently loses say 20% or 30% of demand, this high-scale machine will have to down-shift to a lower scale, and it will do so catastrophically. The end result is higher prices. ICEs will become even more expensive than EVs, in a more rapid fashion than people expect. Automakers which have not leapt far enough into the EV world as the weight of their ICE assets drags them into the abyss will not survive. This is just one major problem facing competitors.\n\nAgain, kudos for laying things down in writing. I think you're way ahead of the game just by doing that. Despite the supposed financial literacy of short sellers, in reality many of them have just jumped from one piece of confirmation bias to the next, so it's good to see someone bringing clarity to their thought process. Good luck."

     "My 2 Cents as a Noob.\n\nI\u2019ve said this before, and I\u2019ll say it again: \n\nNo offense, but it stumps me when, even Tesla owners, continue to compare a Tesla with other EVs. To me, it is like you are comparing Apples and stones (or was I supposed to say Oranges here?)\n\nEvery Tesla Auto is an EV, but not every EV is a Tesla. Do cars have 4 wheels? Yes. Do cars have a way to run? Yes, they do. But that does not make any EV Manufacturer a competitor to Tesla. Tesla is a Computer on Wheels that is going to further blow any competition out of the water with FSD (doesn\u2019t matter when it releases to the Public). \n\nTesla has been, is, and will always be ahead of 99% of the Competition. IMHO. \n\nIn my mind, Tesla is spelled like this \u201c**S**-**Y**-**N**-**E**-**R**-**G**-**Y**\u201d.\n\nThe Competition: \n\n(1) Is late in the race by at least a decade;\n\n(2) Is still focused on ICE Cars, for most part, since it is their bread and butter - they cannot just abandon suddenly, what they have been good at doing for close to 100 years (and is still earning them $$$$$$$) and run a race on a totally different track that would add to their Revenues several years/decades (?) down the line to match what they have been making for so long. Most of their resources are still focused on keeping these Revenue streams flowing - and while they continue to do this, Tesla will, as usual, continue to focus all it\u2019s energies to moving forward in the EV-space.\n\n(3) Will be spending their time, effort and money trying to bring down Tesla or to slowing Tesla down - again a distraction from their goal to accomplish FSD.\n\n(4) will be aiming at where Tesla is right now, and by the time years roll by and the competition reaches Tesla\u2019s capabilities, in terms of Range, driving technology etc., Tesla would already have moved further up in these and other new capabilities.\n\n(5) Will continue to sell through their Dealers-with lesser maintenance being required on EVs (compared to ICE), the middleman will try to make more money on each Sale, adding no value  as such, but, at the same time, adding and passing the additional cost to the Buyer. The last time we bought an ICE Car (tho it was also fun at some level, and a good learning experience for my son who was buying it), I hated having to spend 5 hours at the Dealership haggling the price down from $35,000 to $24,000 (which is  68% of the price that was first quoted - I\u2019m really amazed that the ICE Dealerships have that kind of power and those kind of margins!) No wonder the Dealership Association have been up in arms against the Tesla sell-direct-to-Customer model. And this campaign by them has been supported full-heartedly by the ICE Companies and their Unions, since their individual and combined existence is in peril, and they would be willing do anything to stop Tesla\u2019s continued progress.\n\nIt is going to be a very steep uphill journey for the behemoths to overcome the inertia (or the lack thereof) to reach where Tesla is at, and also keep up with the innovation that Tesla has been, and will continue to drive, for it\u2019s \u201cFan Boys\u201d and \u201cFan Gals\u201d - we are (almost?) a cult now \ud83d\ude09. You will not be able to move the needle for me from my love for Tesla.\n\nMy prediction: While all the other Auto Companies continue to struggle to play-catch-up with Tesla, by 2035, I think the Tesla Stock has the potential to rise to $6,000 from where it is now (and, of course, we can expect it to have split further by then)."

Yes the tech stuff is nice and all, but FSD will come from a lot of companies, and tbh I still believe that Waymo is the best option as they can literally supply anyone and still make cash. If Tesla hands out the FSD tech, they might as well kill their own car business. Battery tech is where the Chinese (CATL, BYD) and Koreans are going to lead (Samsung). \n\nAlso it's ridiculous that same people believe they can keep up that growth factors until they sell like 15+ million cars a year. First of all you gotta find the double amount of buyers each year. 100-200k per year isn't that hard, especially when you have a lot of hype and fanboys. The main problem is getting the average buyer to get one of these instead of an VW or Toyota. It's getting harder from now on."

If i ever need money for a property deal ill just take out a loan against my shares & use the cash flow to payback the loan + interest.\n\nWith giga berlin & austin up & running, tesla is no longer facing serious capex hits & can begin farming profits. 6 people i personally know have traded in their ice cars for brand new teslas with gas prices so elevated. My hope is that this is going on with the mass populace as well. Many new construction homes & custom home builds that i\u2019ve walked recently have built-in ev chargers in the garage. There is a shift to ev its just a matter of where all the market share goes & if tesla can retain its lead within that share.\n\nBut for me personally, i only invest whatever im willing to lose & make sure i save a large enough cash pile to dca if need be. Everyone\u2019s strategy is different so i\u2019m sure regardless what anyone says in this thread you\u2019ll do whatever you think is the best decision for you.

Obviously TSLA is $1 trillion, but the point of the question is, how much are you willing to pay for control of the company. How much are you willing to pay to buy enough of TSLA to be able to walk in there and tell some manager there to kick rocks - again, assuming you had enough money to do this. Frankly, there are very few other companies I would be willing to gain control of before TSLA (MSFT, NIO, and IBM -yes I kno it's an odd choice).... Tesla is one of those companies that is massive and yet is also poised to grow significantly. I personally would want to know more about the viability of Optimus. \n\nBut ultimately, I would pay $100b for 10% of Tesla (so $1T market cap). I would think for most things, 10% wouldn't be enough to get what I want in terms of strategy/direction, but it would definitely buy me a say. However, anything over about $1200 per share would mean I wouldn't be able to buy enough shares to have an impact, so I would probably lose interest. However, if I had some rich friends, we could pool our billions together, so $1200 is reasonable given expectations of growth."

As much as we enjoy being school teachers it's not all bags of cash and rock star fame so doing our best to set up that nest (egg).

With their agile processes they continue to improve margins. And will be the company that sells the $25k EV for the masses.  \n\\- Is the only company that has the data to solve Self driving cars on a large scale, because of their datalead. Waymo has a much smaller dataset. To upside potential here is huge.  \n\n\nI like google, but i have more knowledge about Tesla.  \nCheck out this video if you want to start learning about investing into companies:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dslAFZsXvLs"

Those are just the things at the top of my mind, I could come up with more. \n\nBtw I have never once held gold anytime before so I\u2019m not a long term gold bull just trying to sell the idea. I\u2019ve only just recently started a position in this asset class. Some would say in this case you should get bitcoin instead but i personally have doubt about bitcoin and would rather go with gold that has historically proven itself."

If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS & not their retail side. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nUber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence & its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable & likely never will be.\\n\\nTSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking & getting closer to all other car manufacturers.\\n\\nNVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications.

Imagine that was a fruitless money sink, Tesla has more chance of creating that service, given that is a pipe-dream now, any justification for tech sector prices left with it)\n\nFood delivery services on the other hand have inserted themselves into a system and take significant margin from take-out services, under pay their staff and triple charge customers (increased menu prices vs. phoning an order in, platform service charge and increasing tip need to even get it delivered).  Beyond a joke they can\u2019t make money despite screwing every party of the transaction over.\n\nWhat room do they have to grow to make profitability? The service is already falling apart.\n\nCouldn\u2019t even make money during the pandemic\u2026 smh. \n\nThat\u2019s a sector crying out for AI, just put delivery costs out to bid based on live demand vs supply (let the drivers pick the pay rate they\u2019ll take) run a delivery support service only, \nintegrate with existing delivery services (Uber etc) \n\n/rant over, fuck doordash"

The reason why wasn't some fundamental breakthrough in computer science, it was because we finally had enough compute to make these large scale networks learn and interpolate without it taking forever. Deep learning impacted the economy because HARDWARE got better. We've had the \"recipe\" for deep learning since like the 50s.\n\nSimilarly, LLMs aren't really all that different from deep learning and the idea has been \"around\" for a while. The most impactful breakthrough was the discovery of something called \"attention\" and \"transformers\" but this is really just an interation in the something called a recurrent neural network, which again is something that's been around since the 1970s. So again, the reason for this compute is HARDWARE related.\n\nIf data is the new oil, then GPUs (or better yet TPUs or other ML focused architectures) are the pump jack."

     "I'm concerned about the next quarterly report, so yeah, the shorts are likely right. \n\nThere is a longer term argument about whether Tesla is close to a plateau as car business. There are only so many vehicles they can build in a given quarter and while they have significant demand now, I don't know if you can say the same once the other car manufacturers (VW, Hyundai, KIA, Ford, GM, BMW, XPENG, NIO, etc.) are all online and expanding capacity and deliveries. Same goes with the self driving tech and charging tech, which Tesla leads right now, but are being challenged on all sides by significant players.\n\nEach year that passes, Tesla will find in more challenging (ie. expensive) to keep its lead. They're still benefiting from first mover advantage, but in today's tech/economic climate, their lead margin will be very difficult to defend and expand. \n\nNow you've got Elon distracted by Twitter and his other side projects (not to mention SpaceX, which is obviously not a side project). He's got a strong leadership team to keep Telsa in top spot for a while longer, but Elon is Tesla's best salesman and they need him to keep focused on selling Tesla and less on his other side gigs. \n\nTeslavangelists will keep pumping because they believe Tesla is about more than just cars. While this may be true in 10+ years, at the moment, their current business is about cars and should be judged on their car-related revenue. When they start making money from their data, software, androids, solar, battery storage, or whatever, I'll consider it then.\n\nFor now, the shorts are well aware of the current market conditions and will take advantage. There are more headwinds than tailwinds for 2022. I expect the stock price will consolidate in a range or head lower, but a significant bullish reversal is unlikely for this year. Hope I'm wrong because I do hold a long position in Tesla myself."

As long as Bill isn't conspiring with others to generate fake news/FUD to drive the price down I don't see this being a 'weighty anchor'.  Seeing it hit $2k in 2024 and knowing it is screwing Bill will be nice.\n\nre: the eventual \"competition is coming\" circle jerk here.  There were a bunch of 'tesla killer' articles in 2015.  That's a buy signal -- as more people look into EVs, and actually start comparing features, prices and when it can actually be delivered... Tesla sells more.  The competition may eventually catch up in 5-10 years on features and production capacity, but they still won't be able to match on profit margin.   This is an Apple situation - in 5-10 years they will only have ~20% of the market, but the lions share of the profits.\n\nedit: macro environment is not great for any tech stock.  TSLA above $1100 in the next 3 months could be a good shorting opportunity.  Shorting TSLA above $1100 in 3-6 months could be unwise."

My $20,000 Tesla investment has become over a quarter of my net worth. When I spoke to a financial advisor they said I should limit any one investment to either 5 to 10 percent of my portfolio, which would mean selling at least half of my 400 shares.\n\nIf I do sell it'll probably be 50 to 100 shares, with perhaps more being sold at a later date."

Are you willing to buy an overvalued stock or not? Because Tesla will ALWAYS trade at a huge multiple. If you are comfortable with the risk and believe the fundamentals of the business will continue to grow then buy the stock, if not then don't, it's that simple."

Meanwhile legacy auto makes uncompetitive units that have a negative gross margin.\n\nThe demand for EVs is a one way street and currently people would rather wait 6 months for a Tesla than to buy a cheaper ice, largely because it is a terrible purchase to buy a completely obsolete car for $40K vs a $60K Tesla which has realized virtually zero depreciation over last 3 years.\n\nThe manufacturing prowess and brand leadership of Tesla auto alone justifies price.

Imo, Teslas probability of getting 100% more gain from here is limited due to its current size. However, i might be totally wrong. Tesla is like crypto, you can\u2019t know what it\u2019s gonna happen to it. My advice is look for other opportunities where there is more upside potential."

I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is.

     "I can't speak to whether cashing out is good or bad.  I can think of a couple cash outs I did that would have netted millions, but at the time I did it, I would have been defying all financial sense not to.\n\nOn the other hand, I know of times I should have taken gains, and suffered substantial losses by the false dogma of \"buy and hold\".\n\nThe tie breaker in your case is the tax situation.  If you're indeed right, then yes it's best to take gains during a low tax window.  \n\nSome will say that selling half is wrong.  They said if you are deciding to keep half invested, then that's your decision, and cutting it goes against your own decision.  \n\nI tend to disagree, because I've learned that for individual stock investors, emotion and psyche are relevant factors.  I track mine in a journal, including worries, ideas, any thoughts I have pertaining to current or future market moves.  Then I go back review the old ones during weekends and closed market days.  It's interesting to track how beliefs and emotions can drive good and bad decisions, and knowing yourself plus that track record and help you calibrate and improve.\n\nTherefore, taking out half for peace of mind could very well be beneficial to your investing, if you apply it in a similar way."

What Elon does this month doesn't matter. It is what Tesla does over the next decade that matters. And don't press your luck by trying to time a sell-off and then buy-back as you might end up getting screwed like the people who sold after Musk made his \"price is too high\" tweet last year.\n\nAnd if this dip is significant enough, maybe think about taking advantage of that to buy some more if you were looking to increase your position. From experience, I can bet that many people are going to ignore that last bit of advice about buying the dip and then FOMO once this short-term noise is over and Tesla rockets up to new all-time highs again because that is what people always do with Tesla stock time and time again."

That risk, and SMB focus, has also kept entries fairly reasonable since the 2021 bubble.\n\nAt the right price I like nearly any of the highly touted cloud peripherals. DDOG & NET near the top of my regret list of not having bought in when they have been at more reasonable valuations, will probably not get them \u201ccheap\u201d anytime soon. I thought the ZS dump a month back was a gift and dove in. CFLT & HCP a couple others I monitor.\n\nI like GTLB & FROG for DevOps exposure outside of the megas. GTLB probably has more upside, and Google backing, but FROG probably the safer/better run company right now IMO.\n\nSWAV - med tech, not buying is my #1 regret the last several years, will probably never see an entry I like.\n\nFintech in general has been cast aside by the market if you want to explore \u201ccheap but not profitable\u201d tech.

When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear."

     "Lately it is $AMR. They are a US-based producer of metallurgical (abbreviated 'met') coal that exports to over 25 countries. Met coal is a key input used for steel production--don't get confused with thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity and whose use is generally more controversial.\n\nThe company is highly undervalued, even for a cyclical coal mining company. It is in the process of reducing its share count by about 30%. To quote some statistics from mid-March: \"It has a market cap of 2.6B and has 300M in net cash. Its 2022 FCF was $1.3B. They have $1.2B remaining in share buybacks authorized, having already done $560M in buybacks since first authorization (beginning 2022 I believe). I'm seeing FCF/EV yields of 30-40%.\" [Read that once more: it generated half its entire market cap in FCF last year]\n\nIt's roughly fairly priced if met coal prices were at $200 a ton, which is the average from 2010-2020. However, actual met prices are currently much higher thanks to surging demand from India/China, as well as bullish sentiment about steel usage in the US thanks to recent fiscal stimulus. [By contrast, thermal coal prices have less of a runway ahead of them barring a terribly cold winter in 2023/4]. We can't replace met coal just yet to produce steel, unlike thermal coal for power generation. Thermal coal can be phased out provided we make the right investments in nuclear/solar/wind/geothermal/hydro/natural gas/crude oil/..., all of which are better for the environment than thermal coal. I believe scientists are still experimenting ways to find cleaner ways of producing steel, like using hydrogen or other new materials. But that's a few decades away.\n\n2023 hasn't posed much of a slowdown at all for AMR, and it locks in contracts at great prices well in advance. Management has made clear they have *no* plans of expansion or M&A and are focused on share buybacks.\n\nI own shares at $153 a share, and it's roughly 1.5% of my portfolio (and will likely become close to 2%). I've been slowly buying in since January of this year.\n\nA similar company to AMR is ARCH, which is also met coal + thermal coal, or CEIX. (BTU is another company I'm excited about but it's a much riskier play than AMR. I'm equally bullish on AMR/BTU and can say more if people want)"

     "$414 billion in 2032 is a bit of a joke. Even if my worst case scenario Tesla is doing $350B in 2030, and that's with just 7.5M car sales compared to their target of 20M.\n\n16% operating margin is also a bit of a joke. That's only 2% higher than their current operating margin while they're not leveraging any of their economies of scale yet. Single piece casting has just started on a low scale in China, and both of their new factories in Berlin and Austin will produce more cars per year than their two current factories combined in due time. It's ridiculous to assume they will only increase their operating margins from 14% to 16% with all that. And then we're not even talking about their ever increasing software sales.\n\nSo while I'm absolutely sure this guy knows his shit from a finance perspective, he's letting reasoning by analogy cloud his view on what Tesla will be doing in the future. \"Other companies can't do it so neither can Tesla\" is the easiest way to get to a faulty conclusion."

As less people want to buy new houses, less building permits are applied for to build new houses. As less building permits are applied for, new units under construction then start to fall. As new units under construction starts to fall, you see U.S. construction and manufacturing payrolls start to fall and an increase in unemployment in the cyclical economy, which leads to a recession. Historically, looking at past recessions, job losses in the cyclical economy almost always pre-empt the recession. Again, why not this time?\n\nWell, if you look at the graphs, building permits peaked in late 2021 and started falling with rising interest rates. New units under construction typically lag building permits by several months, as such, new units under construction peaked in October 2022 and started to decline. US manufacturing payrolls then started to decline after October 2022 as well. So why have we not seen an uptick in unemployment in the cyclical economy as of yet?\n\nWell, we just had a once in a century global pandemic, and a lot of pre-planned construction during that time had to get delayed. As such, we recently had a small uptick in building permits in January 2023, which coincidentally resulted in a minor uptick in units under construction in March 2023, which resulted in an uptick in manufacturing payrolls.\n\nBut guess what, building permits has once again started to go down again as of February 2023 and I believe with interest rates set to remain above 5% for the foreseeable future, we have hit a clear peak in building permit applications and the broad national momentum remains to the downside. This will result in further degradation in new units under construction moving forward, and increased job losses in the cyclical economy, which has nearly always historically pre-empted a recession.\n\nI do not believe the fed is taking these lags in their data into account properly. The fed cannot control the lags, they can only control interest rates and continue to raise interest rates higher and higher until they see a crack in services employment. This does not make any sense though because unemployment in the services sector rarely ever pre-empts a recession.\n\nI believe, based off looking at the data, the fed should have stopped increasing rates awhile ago and waited for these lag effects to play out. In my opinion, in the coming months, the cyclical economy is going to get hit hard with job losses in the construction and manufacturing industry which will inevitably result in a recession later this year.\n\nI know this is completely 100% against current reddit sentiment and that most people believe we are just going to trot merrily off into the next major bull market with SPY at 5000 by EOY. So I will wait patiently for my downvotes and to be called a degen pajama ber. \n\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/building-permits\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNDCONTSA\n\nhttps://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/manufacturing-payrolls"

It costs $66 less to get copper delivered in two days (spot price) as opposed to in 3 months. It reflects a smaller desire to buy copper right now, and that buyers are less desperate to get copper into storage. [If the 2 day and 3 month price was the same, investors are indifferent to buying it now and storing it for 3 months or just buying it in 3 months; if the anticipated need for copper starts to fall or storages are sufficient, then investors demand a discount to hold even more in storage]\n- Chinese [inventories fall](https://i.imgur.com/LhxaqKw.png) as Western ones rise, indicating relative weakness in Western demand. Still, Chinese demand has been much weaker than predicted.\n\nThis is all a short-term story, of course: [here is a post of mine with the longer term bull case](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1288qre/copper_investors_are_demonstrating_the_bystander/), though slightly out of date. I'll give a small sample of the key graphs:\n\n- [Global mining capex extremely muted](https://i.imgur.com/vHaQpT8.png) relative to earnings (Mining.com)\n- [Record low base metal inventories, including copper.](https://i.imgur.com/lGLE1Xl.png) (Goehring & Rozencwajg)\n- [Copper shortages might even be imminent](https://i.imgur.com/XsY4Ucr.png) (FT)\n- [Fewer copper mining discoveries are being made](https://i.imgur.com/KEEb7WE.png)\n- [Bringing mines online is an arduous process](https://i.imgur.com/S3kcXqC.png) (S&P Global)\n- [Chile, one of the biggest producers, seeing production at lowest level in 6 years](https://i.imgur.com/diZAhqN.png). (Bloomberg) Chile represents \"a quarter of the world's mined copper.\"\n\nMarkets have been anticipating a possible near term glut, but the medium/long term story is unchanged: it's hard to get miners to dig more, and the substitutes (aluminum) have their own issues. What can happen when inventories draw down so much?\n\n> In 2006 exchange inventories fell to briefly 1 mm tonnes, and when adjusted by days of consump- tion, inventories had fallen to less than five days of consumption\u2014the lowest levels since 1990. And just like in the late 1980s, base metals prices experienced a massive surge. From the end of 2004 to the beginning of 2006, copper, nickel, lead, and zinc prices surged between 300% and 400%.\n\nFor context: in mid-January of this year, \"The London Metal Exchange's (LME) global warehouse network held 654,345 tonnes of metal at the end of December, less than half the tonnage registered at the close of 2021\". Another source I found says today's total base metals inventory for the LME is 768K. Reuters: \"Total registered stocks in the ShFE warehouse network stood at 228,797 tonnes at the end of December\" (LME + Shanghai Exchange are the two key sources of inventory)\n\nRight now, commodities are the real contrarian trade in my view. The outlook in the near term is very bearish, until suddenly it won't be."

     "Obviously the standard answer is index funds, with some bonds at his age, and keeping everything in one stock is crazy. But here are some other things to think about.\n\n- If he's behind on his retirement funding, then that's probably not going to work out for him. Various measures of market valuation still say the overall market is valued pretty highly, and companies like Vanguard are projecting low returns over the next decade. Depending on how far behind he is, that might not be viable.\n\n- Volatile stocks are horrible for people prone to buying high and selling low, but apparently your dad has the cojones to hold on for the long term. TSLA still has to do well but at least he'll reap the benefits if it does.\n\n- TSLA's prospects don't entirely depend on self-driving. Watch the recent Investors Day presentation, most of it was about radically reducing costs while increasing quality and scale. Also check out Sandy Munro's videos, he's an engineer who consults with automobile manufacturers. He's famous for taking apart an early Model 3 and heavily criticizing it; now he raves about how far Tesla is ahead of other manufacturers. And it's not just the car business; they make as many battery cells as they can and sell the extras to power grids. They're even starting up their own lithium refinery.\n\n- Finally, if you talk him out of his TSLA and TSLA goes to the moon then he's going to blame you for keeping him poor, move in with you, and complain about might-have-beens every day."

The practicality alone would make me not bank on it happening, but then you got the troubles brewing with China relations, and all the boomers retiring with their capital fleeing from risky bets, and the increase competition, amongst the 10 other more speculative possible issues that I won\u2019t get into. I haven\u2019t looked into Teslas financials lately but you could def attempt a discounted cash flow or look at bullish projections of earnings and reverse engineer stock price based on if it maintains the PE or whatever. But while I wouldn\u2019t tell him to not invest in Tesla, I definitely would tell him to diversify most of it. Oh also if he averaged up from 130$ it looks like he\u2019s close to break even if not down, but either way just show the math on how quickly it could fall apart if the rug is pulled like a China factory close or calculate what happens when Elon has to use all his billions on Twitter and has to borrow with Tesla at these higher rates when they Barely escaped bankruptcy at low rates."

     "If he plans to hold on until 2030 he will most likely be totally fine. This year is going to be maximum volatility for the immediate future. It's still incredibly risky at his age though. \n\nI rolled over my 401k in 2020 and went heavy into Tesla before the S&P inclusion and still had cash available when they announced the inclusion. Due to that I doubled it instead of just buying index funds since index funds had to buy Tesla. I was up over 250% in about a year, but due to my strategy of not trying to time the market, I went lower than my original investment once it dropped. It's now back above that, but it may be a rough year for Tesla meeting the growth targets. \n\nThe current bear market has hit growth stocks hard. If we get out of the recession, than Tesla will easily rise above it's previous all time high if they keep growth and profitability in line. It's definitely no certain outcome, but their ambitions are sky high and with the vertical integration and extremely low debt overall, they have huge potential for growth this decade. \n\nGrid scale energy storage having endless growth potential, a Tesla compact vehicle, mass production of batteries internally, robotaxis and robotics are all in work for the decade which some of those projects could easily push Tesla into the multi trillion dollar range. \n\nReally, Elon has been the main issue lately for Tesla headwinds, but he was the guy who directed ship to the current valuation."

     "You are thinking about this correctly. It's risky as hell.\n\nI made really good gains betting on Tesla prior to the pandemic. It became a pretty big part of my portfolio but it didn't start that way. Gains got it there. When the pandemic hit I got out, thinking the economy was going to crash. I delayed getting back in when it was clear that it wasn't, because Musk started acting very erratic (or showing his true self) turning off his primary customer base. The cars were getting more and more expensive and the promise of fully self-driving cars and robotaxis seemed further and further away. \n\nI'm back in to some degree because I see some positives in where Tesla is heading now (except the self-driving progress is still unclear) but I'm cautious. I'm in my 50's and I believe in preserving the gains I have and trying to grow them in a balanced way, not being overly aggressive.\n\nTesla has a lot of strengths and advantages in their market, but there is also a shitton of risk. Musk is one of them. Everything relies on him and he is a loose cannon. What if something happens to him tomorrow? The competing car companies are working hard to catch up. Even if everything goes well, their PE does not nearly justify the stock price. They have a long way to go to make that equation work. \n\nYour dad may be right that the stock will shoot up dramatically over the next 3-5 years. Then again, it may not. Who knows? It's a bet, like any other bet. Bets like this should be hedged. Being really greedy tends to bite you in the ass. \n\nI used to work with a guy that was past retirement age but had to still work full time. This was after selling a company he owned. In his case it was because he lost everything to Bernie Madoff. He made a bet and it completely failed. I felt bad for him."

     "The hard truth is that it\u2019s his money and he can invest however he wants with it. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not a fan of Tesla as a company nor am I a fan of Elon. That aside, I would recommend reviewing the company financials (10-K and 10-Q for example), the company leadership, their \u201cmoats\u201d, risks, and their long term strategy amongst other things. I would then recommend he do his own financial analysis looking at free cash flow over his time horizon. If your dad has done this and understands what he\u2019s reading and is still on board for Tesla, then so be it. \n\nBut what you as an individual need to do is to understand how his decisions impact you. You then need to understand what his worst case scenario is and determine what your boundaries are. If the stock crashes and he cannot live off Tesla, are you going to support him? Provide him housing? Elderly care? Pay his bills? Call me heartless but I would not if my parents invested like this without a backup assets to generate cash flow in retirement.  Either way, you need to set your boundaries and expectations with your father. He may be relying on you as his fall back. \n\nOn the flip side, investing in just one company is not inherently bad. If you understand the risks and the company then you can probably get away with it. But, you really really need to understand the business, it\u2019s leadership, risks, the competition, the industry, and all the other ins and outs.

     "Unfortunately this is more common than you think. And most of the time this behavior is coming from a normally functioning adult, who tends to act rationally about anything else. I've heard this story n number of times either from a friend or a friend of a friend and whether its $TSLA or $NVDA, the rationale tends to be the same. \"I'm financially behind my peers, I need to take on bigger risk to compensate.\"\n\nWhat's even more unfortunate is that these are the people (especially in his life stage) who've probably been fiscally responsible up until this point. The funny thing about investing is that you only truly understand your risk tolerance once you've blown up. Most successful investors and traders advocate this as a necessary learning experience. In the case of your dad, I don't blame him if this is his situation but the fallout will be brutal. \n\nThe only thing I can suggest is for him to reduce his overall exposure by selling half of his shares, and putting 10% into leaps. That way, if he's ultra-bullish he can capitalize on the upside.\n\nThis is an extreme opinion, but if you're up for the challenge maybe this will change his mind.\n\nYour dad probably knows this, but tell him how in every bubble the vast majority of investors lose money. That's basically what makes it a bubble, right? If a lot of people didn't lose a lot of money than it wouldn't be a bubble. Conversely, there are always the few people who make it out with their shirts and they're most likely either 1. connected 2. rich 3. an expert (someone who was an industry expert before the bubble happened) 4. an institution, or 5. extremely lucky. Now ask your dad, is he any of these? No. He is exactly the prototype of the \"retail\" investor who loses their shirt from this bubble. It's not the well-connected VC folks who invested in $TSLA back in 2009. It's not the wealthy ultra high-net worth individuals who's money is managed by a family office. It's not the battery scientist who's been tinkering with EV technology since 2012. It's not BlackRock who sees and hears everything. And it's not the lucky guy who bought $TSLA in 2014 because he thought the cars looked cool.\n\nYou can't just think of the wealth destruction of a bubble popping when $TSLA goes from $400 to $100. Look at the recent reports, the amount of $$$ retail is plowing directly into $TSLA the past 3 months is staggering. THESE are the \"chumps\" who become the bag-holders. The true wealth destruction is when $TSLA goes from $100 to $200, sucks in as many retail investors as it can so the folks from #1 - #5 can offload their positions, then goes down to $50. Right now is exactly when retail is left holding the bag. There's a really good reason why most bubble charts look the same. Whether it's $TSLA, $CSCO back in the dot-com bubble, Bitcoin, or the Dutch East India in the 1700s. At the end of the day, speculation and bubbles are driven by human greed that never changes. What also never changes is that that only the minority end up winning big (category #1-#5) and they're the ones cashing out during the initial plunge and the initial bull trap recovery. It's always the normal investors who missed out on the initial gravy train that jump in too late with eager eyes and end up getting hurt the most."

     "Tesla is not SpaceX. The two are distinct. They only happen to have the same CEO.\n\nCurrently automotive is by far the biggest money maker wrt Tesla. The other business lines do play a part in the valuation but currently only a very small one. That may change (personally I think energy will eventually rival automotive when it comes to revenue). So to qiualify your initial statement: No. Tesla is not a car company. Even if you were to reduce it to the automotive business line its approach to delivering mobility products is so much different than what legacy car companies do that it's misleading to apply the same term.\n\nSpaceX will not be public. The aim for SpaceX is to get to Mars. This is not a profit oriented venture. Going public would eliminate the possibility of reaching that goal as investors want to see return on investments and would force SpaceX to abandon this in favor of more mundane operations."

     "The answer is sort of. SpaceX is completely and likely always will be completely privately owned. That is musk's baby, he wants no one having authority of any kind outside of the company. So that one is a no. However to answer the rest of your question, the reason Tesla is worth more than any other automotive company is because they are not an automotive company. They are a convenience based electronic powerhouse. The solar products, the battery back ups, starlink(a future ipo for starlink is possible but unlikely until mass saturation) and the merchandise are  all part of the business, however just like the cars, they are not the true value in the business. Tesla is first and foremost a technology company (think apple Microsoft or google) who specialize in their own hardware(much like apple) due to their need to control the parameters of those pieces (much like apple). Personally I do think they are worth more than their valuation. I'd say they are currently about 30% overweight and within the next 5 years could easily see their valuation double again as they continue to evolve and expand."

     "Pltr. They are forming long term customers with big contracts, and the military still believes there is literally no other company or product that does what palantir can do. Way better moat and amazing sales growth that can be sustained, as software is a reliable well scaling business model.\n\nAnd smaller market cap.  A 50 B software company like pltr can easily grow to 300 B without even becoming a top ten software company.  So a 6x increase isn't that crazy over a reasonable time line.  Tesla is 800 B, for them to double once would make them more valuable than Nvidia, and on the same level as Microsoft, amazon and apple. The actual biggest producer of cars right now is worth less than 300 B, by contrast. \n\nIf tsla were priced better, I'd say it's a tough call, but they're not. Tesla fan boys are in here talking like scaling a car company is like Apple.  That's idiotic. Supply chains get harder, and managing repeat annual sales and high quality is very hard.  \n\nEvery single large car company could produce more than they do, but they limit production to manage sales (excluding the current chip shortage). In fact, tesla is still small enough they can manage a chip shortage.  They wouldn't be able to do that if they were building 1 million cars this quarter, like their major competitors. \n\nAnd there might be a natural limit to how many cars are demanded from a single label. Nobody makes more than 6-7 million cars per year. Once there are so many on the road, consumers get bored and want something different. They are also fighting brand loyalty. They are a lot of Mercedes benz drivers that might be in a tsla now that will switch back when they can. In a few years, tesla will no longer command novelty. \n\nLastly, the used market. This is the first year tsla will make over 1 million cars. The thing about big growth is that the demand for teslas are being met by new production right now.  In about 3 years, there will be a million used teslas on the market. Which means a large part of tesla demand can be fulfilled in the market without tsla making money. That doesn't really exist right now, with only thousands of used vehicles available now. This is why car companies like Toyota have to carefully plan and limit how much they produce, they know if 10 million people are buying Toyota this year,  half of them are buying used."

Their issue is making money, but their product and their ability to deliver it, as far as I know, has not been brought into question. \n\nTSLA relies far too much on Elon Musk's quasi personnality cult for my taste. He has been a successful trailblazer in some ways, but he's also got a track record of making many pie-in-the-sky promises and predictions that fall completely flat. As a CEO he's somewhat erratic, and I could see him crashing and burning, taking the company and stock down with him. \n\nNot only that but TSLA's products are far more complex and difficult to deliver, there are just a lot more ways that projects can be delayed and fall apart."

If they don't, their automotive and solar/energy storage alone should already be somewhere between $2T and $3T by that time.

If they somehow get spend and compensation hemorrhage to stop, their multiple fixes itself and the stock can justify $40+.  I'm reminded of when Amazon used to spend every dollar and pundits said the stock will never move because of P/E.  When E started moving, P was happy to go parabolic.\n\nShort term?  TSLA has some good sentiment coming its way.  Pundits seem to have forgotten who/what Musk is, and they're back to santiizing and normalizing him and building him up to be some \"genius\".  That plus some imminent news headline wins with factories opening and EV adoption getting hyped and all the rest means TSLA could certainly go up 25% before PLTR can."

We are currently guaranteed 30 years of warming. We are also guaranteed to hit the 2.0 degrees if we hit 1.5 in sub 10 years. At that point in time I expect the world to hit the panic button.

How many million pre orders for the cybertruck that starts production next year? How many pre-orders for the roadster with production starting next year? How many pre orders for the big rigs with production (potentially) starting next year? \n \nFactor in the constantly evolving Tesla power wall & solar panels/solar roofs, and 2-3 more products that haven't been announced yet by Tesla, yes- there is huge potential. New factories being built across the world, the potential of buying out other EV companies, and expanding on their super charger system is also on the horizon. \n\nAnd believe me, the second SpaceX (starlink) goes public, I'm in on them as well."

     "> Extreme growth: They have a 51% revenue CAGR starting with the realease of the model s in 2013 up until last year. This year they will probably have another 50% growth and <<probably>> another 50% in 2023. The point is that so far over the long run TSLA has grown extremely quickly and consistently. They will also have new models such as Semi, cybertruck and roadster arriving <<probably>> next year. AND they sell their cars with excellent margins. So their growth is very sustainable.\n\nThey will not grow 50% this year. Inflation forces people to lower their luxury choices. With the cheapest Model 3 now being over 46k, the market is smaller. \n\nRegarding the growth, you seem to miss that competition is already there with the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Porsche Taycan. VW is also pushing hard. The Semi, Cybertruck and Roadster 2 have been announced years (Roadster 2 in 2017) and we have not seen any progress. \n\nThe high margins are worrying, not a positive. Car companies generally have terrible margins as it is a high capex business. EVs don't change that. So if you have high margins, that means you have a technology advantage - which Tesla did have for years. But that is changing. Nearly all car companies work together with the same batteries suppliers as well.\nI would say that that growth is not sustainable. If the growth is just 20% (which would still be huge in a recession/inflationary environment), the stock would go down 60%+. \n\n\n> Diverse and unique side businesses: As of this moment tesla gets the vast majority of its revenue and profit from selling cars, thats undeniable. But they have a lot of aspirations. Firstly, energy storage is going to be cruicial in transitioning the world to sustainable energy and tesla is at the forefront of this industry and are therefore in a prime position to capitalize on that. \n\nAspirations are cool, but results matter. Tesla is not at the forefront of battery storage and they don't have a technology advantage here. It will also be a low margin business.\n\n\n> Secondly tesla is dabbling with insurance and juding by their lates report that business unit seems to be breaking even and soon will become profitable. It has only launched in a few states so far and there is a lot of room to grow. \n\nInsurance is a highly regulated area and just 1 year of Tesla insurance does not mean, that they can become profitable. Insurance go through good and bad times and those often come unexpetec. \n\n\n> Solar shignles and solar in general is also another potential area for growth although tesla doesn't seem to be prioritizing it.\n\nThe solar shingles where Elon did not represent a working unit at the presentation, very trustworthy. \n\n\n> Autonomy: Elon has many times over estimated his own timelines so this point is a little weak BUT if tesla does indeed manage to actually get FSD working properly (im guessing 2025 is the year where they start driving tens of thousands of kilometers without any issues) then tesla is poised to make a ridiculous amount of money. \n\nAnd if my grandmother has wheels, she would be a bike. THere is no indication that Tesla is any closer to true FSD than back in 2017. Mercedes was the first to get L3 regulatory approval. \n\n\n> Since the vast majority of teslas by that time will have the hardware necessary to become autonomous, teslas will turn from depreciating cars to profit producing assets. This will have a massive effect on the whole auto industry and no doubt make tesla a lot of money. This is of course very risky but even if they have a 10% chance of pulling it off, id say its worth it.\n\nI would say they have 0% of pulling it off. Any how many people will really share their cars with strangers?\n\n\n> With all the infrastructure tesla is developing for AI, they could conceivably rent it out to other companies such as AWS but for AI training. Tesla hasn't spoken about this to my knowledge but once FSD is fully trained and has incredibly low failure rates, this would be a great use for all that hardware.\n\nAgain where is the proof that they have anything tangible? I see Waymo driving driverless, I don't see Tesla. \n\n\n> Tesla bot? Similar to point 3 but 1% chance of succeeding. But again if they do succeed, trillions of dollars could be made.\n\n0% chance that they pull it off. Boston Dynamics is the leader here. Look at the R&D Budget of Tesla and with letting people go - how should that be accomplished?\n\n\n> they need to fix vehicle quality and service. It doesn't seem to be a problem right now since demand is so much higher than supply but in the future it could become a problem.\n\nIt is already a problem in Germany, in that they probably fail the T\u00dcV after 3 years. I guess there might be potential lawsuits.\n\n\n\n> There seems to be a massive minerals shortage (lithium) coming. Not sure how tesla will handle this but even if they do secure all the materials they need, their price will be extremely high.\n\nAnd margins will compress, thus reducing the implied valuation.\n\n\n> With all of this being said tesla right now has a PE ratio of about 90. To give some context back in 2017-18 amazon had a similar PE while growing slower. They were already maxing out all their business lines. Tesla on the other hand is just getting started. They seems to have all the core technologies nailed and with a very solid roadmap ahead. So all in all, at this point in time, tesla seems to be a solid buy, just like amazon was 5 years ago, probably even better.\n\nAmazon is mostly a tech company, while Tesla is a car company with huge capex. Tesla is valued as though they would sell 10m cars, have twice the margin of Toyota with twice the Average Selling Price and twice the valuation. One misstep and they fall 80%+\n\n\n> Im curious to hear counter arguments to this. I keep seeing posts about how tesla is incredibly overpriced and that was true a year or two ago but imo not anymore.\n\nStill true and even more so given the high inflation of materials. Lithium was around 77k in 2019, it is now at 477k. Tesla is the Cisco of our era. Look at the stock price of Cisco and news from the dotcom time. Very similar."

     "All of this talk and almost no discussion about how a $700B+ valuation is justified.  PE is currently 92.  They warrant a high PE no doubt, but the question is whether \"high\" should mean 40 or 70 or 90 or 110.  That's the discussion I'd like to see.\n\nI don't think Tesla will continue 50% growth for long.  Yes, they've averaged that and probably still have some of that left.  But it's not clear to me that the timeline on that is indefinite.\n\nThe big question is when Tesla's sales will become demand-ristricted rather than supply-restricted.  With competition increasing, that might not be too far into the future.  A lot of people erroneously think the question is whether Tesla can make more money than Ford or VW.  That's not the question.  It's how much market share VW and Ford (and others) end up with and where that leaves Tesla.  Also, will Tesla's margins survive increased competition and a demand-restricted environment?  My guess is no.\n\nTo pre-empt the same arguments I see everytime this stock comes up: Yes, I get the whole \"The EV pie is getting bigger, so even reduced market share is still more EVs sold\" thing.  I also get that Tesla is currently supply-restricted rather than demand-restricted.  And I get that many legacy automakers have a capital and debt weight around their necks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add: Also, why is the Cybertruck also \"about to come out\"?  I've been hearing this for years.\n\nEdit to add #2: The future telling of Tesla folks reminds me of Enron's accounting.  Let's take all the future profit we expect to make from an idea we had today and count it as revenue right now!"

     ">Elon started acquiring Twitter stock, before he sold large chunk of TSLA shares, which was done for tax purposes according to him.\n\nThis is wrong. He sold the Tesla shares in November 2021 and the 13G indicated that he surpassed the threshold of 5% ownership from Twitter on 14.March 2022\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Elon acquired the largest portion of the capital needed for the acquisition of Twitter by getting loans against his shares and attracting numerous high-profile outside investors like Larry Ellison and the Qatar state investment fund. He did not need to actually sell his shares to raise money.\n\nBut he did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Buying a company like Twitter requires extensive research and the use of a lot of resources (mainly financial). This was probably planned at least a year in advance, so the great oracle Elon probably did not have the chance to perfectly time his TSLA selling to maximise his profits.\n\nLooking at his actions, he did not do any proper research on Twitter. It is clear that from his action and the \"tax-excuse\" (which he could have paid selling less shares than he did, or borrowing against his shares) -  that he is trying to sell Tesla stock. He does not want to crash the stock price tho. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you actually think that a guy who tweeted that the TSLA share price is too high cares so much about his shareholders opinion, so he will orchestrate a very expensive and time consuming operation that could potentially greatly harm his public and business persona, just so he will have an excuse to sell his TSLA shares? Musk has stated numerous times that the sole purpose for his accumulation of wealth is to secure the funding for the dream of his life, which is making humans interplanetary species. Couldn't he just have said that he is going to sell a small portion of his TSLA holdings for that reason?\n\nThere is only one thing that he visible cares about, and that is his fortune. Everything from the stock options to how he lives shows that. Nah if he would sold for \"interplanetary\" reasons, I doubt many would believe him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>No, TSLA stock probably would not have crashed even if he did not state any reason for the reduction of his stake in the company. It is not like he sold 50 percent. Also, have you seen how devoted are the teslabros?\n\nIt is exactly why it would have crashed the stock if he did not give any reasons. They are very devoted, so they would question his leadership if he sold and probably would do the same. \n\n  \n\n\n>I obviously can't say for certain why Elon decided to back out of the deal. My personal opinion is that he probably just changed his mind in part due to miner setbacks like the number of bots on the site. As we all know , he is not very stable as a person and it is probably not as deep as many people think it is.\n\nThe bots are just an excuse. What many forget is also that the company talks about monetised accounts are 5% bots. Meaning that Elon would have to prove, that more than 10% of Twitter's revenue would come from bots. If that would be true, there would be another bunch of lawsuits against the board and Jack Dorsey. \n\nYes it is not as deep as many think. He knows Tesla is overvalued, so he tries to sell as many shares as possible, without imploding the stock -  as he has many loans collatarized against them."

Stocks like that don't happen in rapid succession (and certainly not in the same space, so looking to other EV companies is a fool's errand)\n\nThey disrupted the entire car space (and more) that encompasses a huge capitalization which went their way.\n\nSo if you want to look to similar stocks (as, I guess, most of us are doing)  then I would suggest the following things to look for in a company:\n\n\\- it is investing heavily in R&D and expansion - even before profitability\n\n\\- (it has an idea for an ecosystem and not just a singular/niche solution)\n\n\\- it is gearing up to attack a GLOBAL market with its investments (not just local to one country)\n\n\\- it is either going to disrupt a market that is already hugely valued (e.g. food, energy, medical, transport, internet/social media) or is going to solve a problem that will hit the entire world in short order (e.g. water shortages due to climate change) or is addressing an issue that will come up in the near future (e.g. large scale battery, solar panel or wind turbine recycling)\n\n\\- there are no other players doing the same (at least not to that order of magnitude)\n\nBe prepared to wait (i.e. invest and then just let it sit for a couple years - even if the stock doesn't move). With disruption it is pretty much impossible to predict that point in time when such a business will take off.\n\nSectors I'm currently looking into that fit the bill: Virtual power plants (if possible including thermal energy storage); Water desalination; Vertical farming; Artificially grown meat; Electric/battery powered shipping and aviation; Battery recycling; Agriphotovoltaics"

     "Google is already up 6% and it was less than a week ago we found out about the split.\n\nI would expect Google share price to continue to appreciate faster than the overall market going in to the split.\n\nThe split will mean Google can join the DJIA which is a nice tailwind.\n\nBut just overall Google is just killing and you want to own.\n\nI thought Apple had a great quarter. Google put up over 3 times the growth rate of Apple!!\n\nout of all the FANGs you have Google growing by far the fastest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow.\n\nGoogle still has tons of assets that the have yet to monetize or fully monetized.\n\nTake Android. Over a billion devices activated per year and Google does not charge a cent. They could do a nominal license fee of $10 and add over $10 billion of revenue which really would be profit as it would not add any new expense.\n\nBut Android is just one example. Google has so many others which just make a massive runway for Google. So if growth starts to slow Google has plenty of levers to pull to keep it going for a very long time. Plus Google keeps adding new ones.\n\nPeople forget that Google is half the age of Microsoft and Apple. It is only a matter of time until Google passes Apple. They already blew past Microsoft. Google has more revenue and makes a lot more than Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook or Netflix. FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\n\nGoogle is also going to do a 20:1 stock split which means they can now join the DJIA. Probably replacing IBM but it could be CSCO (Cisco). That will also give an additional strong tailwind.\n\nBut the other thing really going for Google is the financial engineering. Google bought back over $50 billion in their own shares in 2021. That means less outstanding shares which then just increases EPS as there are less shares.\n\nGoogle had over $65 billion in free cash flow in 2021. They also have over $140 billion in cash just doing basically nothing. Google could really increase their buyback and that significantly decreases shares. So share price appreciations with Google basically doing nothing. Why they call it financial engineering.\n\nBTW, in the past people would say there is this law of large numbers. Which was such a croc. It was the reason given for Apple growth slowing. Well Google has finally put that to rest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow. They are now an over $250 billion dollar business. Will be well over $300 billion next year.\n\nI am old but I have never seen a more amazing company. The fastest in history to get to 1 trillion market cap. Then the fastest to $2 trillion. Amazon is actually three years older than Google and why the records are with Google.\n\nPeople think Google genius is with their technology. But actually the most genius thing they did was using the dutch auction for search. That was just brilliant. It will also help them with the government as Google does not set price."

Still it is true that if you got into ARKK a couple years or so again, your timing hasn't been the best.\n\nAlso, ARKK specifically has TSLA in it and TSLA has been rocking it compared to their portfolio average, so they need to keep selling it off to avoid being too heavy into it, which isn't helping. Sadly, everything else is doing poorly too when TSLA is down, so they don't get a chance to buy the dip a while back either."

All they have to do is provide a service equal to or greater than any human and they'll replace 3/4 of every call center team. I suspect most organizations will require a few humans to learn from but the vast majority of calls will be replaced. In Canada, what would be a 50k role MSFT might collect 10k. This is assuming MSFT is the company that drives that optimization. It's also possible that a Startup provides that service. In which case they pay open AI for the access and MSFT gets there cut from the server utilization.

The asset (stuff) itself has value, and the rent money has value. How to determine that value is the trick. And reasonable people can disagree on that methodology. Using Tesla as an example, there are people who think that due to their sales growth that a 70 P/E ratio is a reasonable multiple to pay for that kind of growth. Others think that\u2019s nuts.

  "Text": "b'Discussed in recent LinkedIn post:\\n\\n>In January the bubble indicator showed that a) the US equity market as a whole was at the edge of a bubble but not in an extreme bubble (i.e., 70% of the way toward the highest bubble, which happened in late 1990s and late 1920s) and b) **the emerging tech companies (e.g., Tesla and Roku) were clearly in an extreme bubble**. I also noted that other bubbly behavior (e.g., SPACs, the IPO boom, the big pickup in options activity) financed by the unprecedented flood of liquidity post-COVID had found its way into the asset markets, making things bubbly. **I showed which stocks were in bubbles and created an index of those stocks, which I call bubble stocks.**  \\nSince then, those bubble stocks popped. They declined by about a third over the last yearwhile the S&P 500 is about flat.'",

CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his Master Plan 3, and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.\\n\\nThe presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.\\n\\nNear the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, There is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesnt require destroying natural habitats. It doesnt require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything. He added, In fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.\\n\\nMusk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Eng'",

No real info on how fast they are ramping up 4680 cells (back in 2020 they were talking as if it will be mass production mode in 2022 changing the battery landscape). Plus continuous delay of their products launched previously. Biggest of all the small car launch is also delayed big time. they will have to get the Mexico GF built before that can be started and I am not convinced they will directly jump to new platform with new GF. Probably 2026 or later. Plus I dont even have to mention so called \"FSD\". its a L2 system that is no where close to being called FSD. \n\nIts already valued like a tech company. Let us see how they navigate various issues as they sell more and more cars. They had to reduce price big time to get demand and I am not convinced even that is long term sustainable as even after discount, its still an expensive car. They need a cheaper car for next level of growth and that is not happening in the near future. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would rather bet on BYD than TSLA at this point."

I mean, good lord, a market cap of 500B on 24b annual revenue?  You're basically buying into the stock at a price that MIGHT be fair if they had like 80% of the global auto market share.  Even worse, look at the price to book value.  It's unreal. Yea, yea, I get it, they are a tech company and not a car company, but fundamentals matter and it seems like if TSLA ever has anything that doesn't 'blow away earnings estimates' the stock will be in free fall.  If you're young, you should gamble with a small amount of your portfolio, but please realize that buying TSLA at their current valuation is exactly that, gambling, big time, and not a sound investment for long term buy and hold strategies."

And those share prices mean nothing without an oustanding shares amount. Nio is still far from priced \"fairly\" just like Tesla is an overpriced EV stock.. worse is that its a Chinese stock with no actual inhouse production and its growing at a slower rate than Tesla while being horribly unprofitable. Stock can go easily -50% from this point. With Tesla thats less of a risk actually even with how stupidly overpriced they are now. They are making good profits have incredible efficient factories of which an additonal 2 opened and it seems like unlimited demand.. Before 2023 end they will approach 3 million cars sold annualy and thats not even accounting for their energy segment. WIth current pricing their PE would be somewhere 80-100 range.  While still providing a signifcant growth story. so yeah.. Bit basic but even at this point i would put my money on Tesla instead of Nio."

Best thing about Tesla is high end consumer market share and circumventing decades of lawsuits about right to repair and aftermarket parts products, but volume sales is tricky business.  Imagine if your own personal car could only be repaired by the dealer and could only be fixed using dealer parts? If they went full subscription/lease long term maybe it would hold, but without subsidies and this legal loophole they currently enjoy they are screwed IMO"

How will these legacy automakers transition to EV, while forgoing their current cash cow which is already at a laughable margin, ICE quickly becoming obsolete. How will Ford and GMs of the world carry on their union and dealership structure that just eats away their margins? These guys are already carrying a massive debt, and it will only get worse as they try to scale into EV.  \n\nEV and ICE are mutually exclusive imo, you can\u2019t just apply the logic that the current market share of ICE will transition into EV and eat away Tesla\u2019s shares.

     "People who decry valuations based on cars sold have a pretty thick blind spot for debt, margins, and regulatory requirements.\n\nFord\u2019s debt is equal to $900 dollars for every man woman and child in the US. Most other legacy companies are in a similar position. I read today that Volkswagen has a $40 billion dollar shortfall in their pension system. Tesla has paid of its small debts early, and largely finances its projects from sales rather then debt.\n\nTesla\u2019s new factory is projected to make a car three times faster, cheaper, with higher specs, and a higher sales price than Volkswagen\u2019s model factories in Wolfsburg and Saxony.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the Ford CEO\u2019s recent admission that Tesla was the leader in terms of manufacturing, profit, and product mentioned specifically that they were unencumbered by the franchise dealer network. Car dealers have been very activist lobbyists since Tesla committed to the direct sales model. The result is that all large manufacturers are legally trapped in a dealer model that turns of customers and sucks profit from their already razor thin margins. The law only applies to legacy companies, and start ups, such as rivian, are free to sell directly.\n\nWould I buy Rivian? No, you\u2019re correct that they are over valued, but I am expecting one of their trucks in my driveway in the coming months. comparing GM or Honda, etc to Rivian and/or Tesla is not a direct comparison. One business controls their entire distribution network, the other doesn\u2019t. One business can build enough cars to meet demand, the other regularly has to cut shifts or push incentives due to overcapacity. One has pricing power, the other regularly sells cars at a loss. Volume is not a good indicator of health in the auto sector."

Right now TSLA is about the value of J&J (surprised?).  J&J has 1.3% of the index.  23,000 bil x 0.013 = 299 billion.  The current market cap of TSLA is 461 Bil.  \\[(461+299)/461\\]x$499\\_per\\_share = price rise to $823/share due to new buying demand.. if volumes of sellers remained the same.  However, if TSLA ever went to $823, for sure (opinion) everyone holding the stock outside the index funds would sell.  So there is a balance here.  A company can be added to an index and have $299 bil of new demand, but all that needs to happen is they find a price where people will sell them the $299 bil 's worth.  In the end, nothing about the company changes.  A price to sales that is 16x the other significant auto makers (taking Toyota for example which is price to sales of about 1.0)  is still defying adjectives.  A book by Shaughnessy studied 40 years of stock market data and found that a price to sales of <1.5 is considered a good deal.  TSLA price to sales is 16.4 at least check at Reuters."

This is a lot more than avg cc sellers earned with other stocks.\n\nIf I sell an index like SPY for same week or fraction a week, I often lose more than gained simply I can not anticipate future.  Stocks I sell cc my cost basis price has to be  below the trading range.  If I sell your TSLA at 160 and get reassigned I  lose more than the intend use the premium for a source of income.   Not sure about you, I often forget to check cc such as having stocks exercised.  If trade in a taxable account one has to pay capital gain tax."

As you aren't selling naked/poor man's why not do the full thing?\n\nIf you get called and you still like the stock to play with but you aren't happy with the current price just sell a cash secured put instead to where you are happy with an appropriate delta. \n\nPlenty of examples and tutorials on wheeling out there."

     "If allowed in your account sell cash secured puts fir a strike below the call strike and if hit you buy at that strike - this will put hold on funds aqualling the put strike so you would need in this case 18000 for share buy and sell covered call + 18000 for additional on hold (tied up) for assignment if hit. The call wouldn't be excersized if put strike is hit so it is possible that you would end up with 200 shares unless you buy the put back for a loss - this is a full wheel turning strategy - also there is nothing wrong with allowing your calls to be pulled away and with tsla uts easy to sell above your input cost instead of base cost this makes a profit most times"

     "Personally, if your not looking to hold your stocks long term.  You said your focusing on high volatility stocks. So it sounds like your trading them and not investing them.  I would not do this strategy. The risk is the stock you pick tanks.  Personally if I were selling calls, I would still pick stocks that pay a dividend and sell 1 month out. Sell the call and then hold even if it goes past your strike and your option gets exercised. You still make a profit on your shares plus keep all the premium.  And if the stock drops, you keep your premium and if you hold longer term as you wait for the stock to rise, you get dividends. \n\nExample. A stock is $100. Pays 2% dividends.  You sell a 105C for 1.00. If it goes to 110, you still make $5 a share plus keep the $100 from your 1.00 credit. And if the stock falls to $90 you keep your 100 for your 1.00 and you get 2% dividend if it stays low for long enough.  And just keep doing that. Yes, if the stock keeps falling the 105 strike will be less, say 0.80. But after a few months you could then lower your strike to the 100 where you originally bought in. If it hits, then your still in profit because you would have collected a few months of expired credit and maybe some dividend funds also.  Just pick a company your comfortable holding long term if needed."

For now they're currently impossible with today's battery technology (the batteries are just too heavy and don't have enough juice), but that doesn't mean that new technology & improvements to existing technology won't make it viable overtime.\n\nI suppose a short position could explain why Gates made such an obviously wrong comment on electric trucks, but I'm not sure I really buy that."

Got a factory in Tennessee that is starting cell production this year to fulfill a $330m order for a 1.2GWh BESS order. Also will qualify for the IRA stipend of $45k/kWh since we do both cells (35k) + packs (10k). We expect over $1.5-2 Billion long term from the IRA just with the one USA factory. Oh and the DOE gave us a $200m grant to build a separator factory in partnership with G fucking M (General Motors). To help them fulfill their performance and safety goals, especially in their Ultium line of cells (think premium). We also are the sole cell supplier for Iveco\u2019s new eDaily van\u2026 an electric version of Iveco\u2019s normal (gas powered) eDaily\u2026 the most popular ($$$) commercial van in all of Europe.

We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think \"gambling\" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.\n\nIf you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.\n\nI think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important."

There is much speculation what Tesla could bring in the future which drives the price up, innovative batteries, the driving AI which is miles ahead of the rest could lead to automated taxis etc. \n\nAlso the cult behind Tesla and the belief in Elon is really driving this, although his memeish behaviour he tends to deliver on his goals i.e spaceX success is huge PR for them. I don't see this popping unless their r&d slows down or other EV start ups like Nio can challenge them, or the big boy manufacturers start to catch them up. I think the latter is likely as the majority of western countries and some Asian are banning the production of petrol powered cars in the next couple of decades.\n\nJust my opinion..

Right now wealthy people are putting their money in the market like they would a bank or CD because of the rapid inflation that is on the horizon. It is because of this that right now things aren't paying high interest on money held, as well as the government. So what these wealthy people can make in the market is much higher then if they just stored their money like usual. But they are going for the companies that are good but cheaper rather than excellent and expensive driving that pretty up on these companies. So not a bubble because there won't be a pop and crash. More of a quick depreciation to actually value which will be higher but not as high. Not to mention the wealthy most likely have 100k or more shares per portfolio. So when the actual economy turns up the stock market will dip as those people will move money back to the interest baring accounts. Basically when good interest rates return to government and private banks you pull out of the market and reposition on the fall."

They are at the very least half a decade ahead of any other EV maker out there in terms of the product they offer. Call me an optimist or a fanboy, but I wouldnt be shocked if Tesla paves the way to a driver-less world taking out the many risks involved with human drivers."

But it does mean that it's likely going to fall, and it'll fall hard, and some unfortunate people will be left holding the bag. When a stock makes a run like this and then crashes, it rarely recovers and when it does it can take a decade or more.\n\nFor example, look at Cisco during the dotcom bubble. It hit $80 in March 2000 but still hasn't regained those highs after the crash. Of course, there are other examples of companies that blew away their 2000 highs long ago. AMZN, AAPL. MSFT, etc."

They do not appraise the intrinsic value of the stocks before buying or selling them, but rather follow their whims and biases. They will twist or disregard any factor to make the stocks appear cheap or expensive, such as using a higher or lower interest rate, projecting a faster or slower growth rate, or anything else that justifies their wish to buy or sell the stock.

When news about Teslas crashing because of distracted drivers came out, my dad and I talked about how completely misleading it was to market their vehicles as being \"self-driving\" or having an \"autopilot\" feature. Sure, [from an engineering perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot) \"autopilot\" technically means some level of human piloting is still occurring...but to the average layperson, the word colloquially implies that the machine doesn't need to be supervised (i.e. saying that someone is \"operating on autopilot\" means that they're distracted).\n\nEven if the engineers had wanted to call it an \"autopilot\" feature, the marketers and lawyers should have stepped in and overridden them. I normally argue that consumers should be responsible for understanding what they're buying, but I can absolutely understand why someone would purchase a car and assume that the car was totally autonomous. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them assumed that the instructions that did warn them to pay attention to the road were just legalese to cover Tesla's ass instead of serious warnings."

For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. \\n\\nIts times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. \\n\\n- Ask yourself what youve learned about your risk tolerance. \\n\\n- Ask yourself what lessons youve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. \\n\\nWhen the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people dont know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of yall. Yall bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; yall dont know what to do, so you panic and then sell. \\n\\nAbout a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai \\n\\nhttps://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-'",

     "It is a lot easier when you\u2019ve held a stock for years and are up big versus a short term holding that has tanked. I bought TSLA around 6 years ago, have recouped my initial investment 8x over and the shares I do currently have are at a $50 cost basis. It would take a massive collapse for me to be in the red on the TSLA shares I have and even if that happens, I\u2019ve profited so much that I wouldn\u2019t care. I\u2019m playing with house money at this point.\n\nIt is a completely different situation with stocks that I have purchased recently, like in the last 3 months. My thesis for getting into these positions has not had the time to play out at all and I have some FUD about whether they will or not. I believe I made good calls on all these positions, but until they have the time to mature, it is hard to stop second guessing. \n\nBasically, it\u2019s easy for an investor with substantial time in the market that has banked good profits to sit there and criticize. Being new to the market or even having new positions can be nerve wracking."

They forget it sold around $100/share in 1999 and sold for $6/share in 2002, and now sells over $3000/share.   The people buying in 1999 were spot on right about the company but grossly wrong about the price.  In fact AMZN didn't again hit a $100/sh until 2010, so they lost money for 11 years if they were foolish enough to hold that long but 99% sold in the single digits or teens."

My spreads expire in April and I am not hoping to fully recover anymore but to raise its price to at least 750. However, yesterday (March 3), another tsla exec sold some more shares. I'm fucking nervous and haven been sleeping well since all started. I feel that I'm about acknowledge the sunk cost and start over...."

I bet on a future of a Falcon heavy not this bullshit.\n\nI am waiting 5 years or 9 may be to see the returns on my philosophical and theoretical knowledge. Aristotle says we see through observations and all answers are in the natural world. Do I need math? Seriously, this fake data feed to me as propaganda by capitalists and fake communists. I have seen both. They play with  minds of the uneducated and weak people. Thus, I lost my money. Selling now will seal my loss but if I own my stock in NIO, then I have the promise of technology surpassing manipulation of some loud math Jim Crammar. I will buy TSLA soon. Tesla is diamond so it will hit 3k. Baron the Billionaire stated that he keep 75 percent but sold 25 percent. Dude. The media is pushing fake news. I am not. BA hit 89 dollars. NIO TESLA will hit rock bottom but the genious mind of Musk will surpass the idoits.  Musk is bigger than Einstein. Musk is free. Einstein was a prisoner of his society. Musk's genius is actually positive and beneficial for human existence. We will go to Mars and our cars will drive themselves. I hope I have the money to send my sons to college in self driving cars so they can be safe in 2037. Until then, I wish all of humanity good health and peace. I am calm."

Its simple, 200 EMA acts as a primary support and resistance, 50 next and 10 the last. What I am seeing is TSLA is expected to have a run-up till 900 or so, and then decline till its able to break out of the 200 EMA. I am expecting the 200 EMA to decline to create a tight trading range till there is news to break it. Thoughts? It is quite simple in its nature and I think there is validity because I think Algos are using the EMA lines to trade as well.\\n\\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/fqaohkBv/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/fqaohkBv/)'",

     "A lot of these stocks never any sense to me from an investor's perspective, and I'm saying this as someone who knows the EV industry well.\n\n* Lordstown - I have no idea why this stock ever appealed to anyone. I never even heard anyone hyped up for any of their vehicles. I doubt anyone but the most hardcore EV enthusiasts could even name one of their EV models that they've announced.\n\n* Lucid - At least it had promise with it's vehicle. But the problem is it simply entered the market too late and only sells very high end luxury vehicles. Also the Saudi backers are undermining the stock by forcing them to build a factory in Saudi Arabia, a country that's a good distance away from all 3 of the largest car markets (China, the US, & Europe) and where there's very little demand for EV's.\n\n* Nikola - The thing was clearly a scam from a mile away. And Hydrogen powered vehicles are NOT EV's, it doesn't matter to the consumer if the hydrogen is turned into electricity to run the car when there's no hydrogen refueling stations near them. IMO it's flat out false advertising to claim that Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are EVs given that it can confuse consumers.\n\n* Nio - Their battery swap stations make no sense. Tesla explored this many years ago in their early days but ditched it for good reason, it's way more expensive to scale then building out an EV charging infrastructure. And Battery-As-A-Service is a terrible idea to, which is why no one else has adopted the strategy. If it weren't for them pursuing these bad strategies then Nio would be a lot more viable IMO.\n\n* Rivian - This company simply moves WAY too slow to be successful. It took them 12 years to bring a single vehicle to market. \n\nBottom line, if you want to invest in EV's just buy Tesla stock, it'll be a lot safer then any of these other EV stocks the OP mentions (given that they're sitting on a ton of cash and are making a profit, unlike the rest of these money losing EV stocks, most of which will probably go bankrupt sooner or later)."

What you're seeing is other legacy automakers coming to maker with EVs that lack one if not all of the following TSLA moats: range, autopilot, charging network, horsepower. \n\nFor e.g. Nissan has a new EV mid size suv coming out for $50k USD. It has a max range of like 285 miles (vs 315 for Tesla Model Y) and acceleration of 7.1s which is almost twice as slow. Then you have to charge the thing and nobody has as many chargers globally than Tesla. \n\nCompetitors will come but they'll still have to play catch up in my opinion. Even if BMW, who I love, came out with a new EV tomorrow for the same price as my Model 3 (they won't), I would be hard pressed to make a change just because of the above important differentiators."

Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs. Autonation for example had a random rally in their Q4 earnings despite net income dropping, a conveniently placed share buyback and the company themselves claiming that used cars will be more expensive for them to obtain. They\u2019re now down -16% from that earning report. \n\nThere\u2019s still hard to obtain cars such as hybrids, EVs and enthusiast products but regular petrol models are widely becoming available without having to fight for MSRP."

EV's you see on the road will massively increase in the next 5 years, it's already happening with EV growth in every single industrialized country sometimes doubling every year like it is in China. So it's certainly a good thing to invest in.\n\nI have money in Tesla because they have strong financials and good growth outlook. People have been concerned about them cutting prices but theyre going to be selling more cars as the EV market gets bigger which should even things out + it really hurts the smaller EV companies as they have to compete with lower prices while having much worse financials.

I thought Id stay in Tesla for a bit longer, but now Im not too sure. I also just dont want to lose the money Ive made off of my investment, but then again, if I pull out, I could be risking not profiting off of another Tesla spike.\\n\\nAny thoughts and advice will be appreciated.'",

There\u2019s no guarantees here and I don\u2019t think many of us will want to tell you what to do.  I sold mine at the end of last week around $170.  I bought in at $112.

It also doesn't matter what they think.\n\nThe important thing when making an investment is that you have an understanding of the story of the company, its catalysts, its trajectory, and its balance sheet. Only then will you be able to stomach 50% drops in the red and still hold because you understand the true value and potential. You need to understand how the stock price is affected by all of those things, otherwise you will never know when to buy, sell, or hold. If you have a thesis, you will know when to buy or sell. If you don't, you will be filled with anxiety and doubt. It's just gambling.\n\nIf you don't feel confident in your decisions as an investor, stick to ETFs until you have a deep understanding of a company.\n\nSincerely, Tesla investor since 2015."

     "Its going to the moon, no its going to Mars eventually. Every car Tesla makes is profitable. EV is the future. Solar is just going to get more juicy as gas/electricity rates go up. Buy more, Gamble, Win big. If it goes down just keep buying more (dollar cost average) until you are ready to retire or at least close enough to avoid risk. Diversification is fine for older folks and people who are scared of gambling but look at the people who stayed in AAPL the last 10 years. Tesla will be a roller coaster but I feel its products are so so profitable compared to any other automaker with fewer long term liabilities. If you want to get rich, find a winner and stick with it, even double down on it. I know this is not popular advice here and its gambly but too many pull money out of winning stocks and invest it in safe but mediocre alternatives. If you can afford it, TESLA is a fine stock to bet the house on. It went crazy high, came back down and will probably to crazy high again at some point. Just enjoy the ride. \n\nSo Im telling you to gamble. But look at the future. The cybertruck and freight business will bring huge profits, automated cars and taxis will bring huge profits, ongoing subscriptions will bring huge profits. Tesla is not just building nice cars, its a massive robot factory too. Musk is a genius and if you can afford to gamble, he is about the best bet out there right now (in my biased but humble opinion). Disclosure:  I'm long on TSLA and will be for at least the next 10 years.\n\nSome other things to consider: if you sell and this is in a taxable account, make sure you allow for a big tax bill - preferably offset the gains against other losses if you have them."

I'm my case, yes, it did continue down, I was down about 20% which was killing me, but my son kept encouraging me and I did have ultimate faith in my charts. I sold yesterday morning. I was watching pre market for a big dump and it didn't so I held until open and after considering I felt good about the 17% overall gain, (and I'm a swing trader) and the price was dropping. There's no emotion, I hit sell. \nYou are only down 6% from there but it's your call and it should be based on your investment style. I have no doubt TSLA will be higher. But the ups and downs take time, that run was a quick gift that I wouldn't expect to continue."

Stock went down, i saw red for weeks. Took a year to get some profit again and sold right away. It was not much, but that's my own fault for beeing greedy. Lesson learned, i thought, because it happend again. But this time it wasn't a stock. It was a coin, the one with the dog on it. Again, put in thousands. It went up for several weeks, then Mr Musk went on a late night show, i was ready for it, this is the moment it will shoot up 1000%. Up to this point, i could cash out and be happy, but i was greedy. Coin went down HARD. And after a few days of seeing it go down, i just sold. Scared of the red number that will come. Took a small profit instead of a very big one. That was really when it happend. I learned from it. After that, i did not get greedy anymore. Had 2 big gains since then.\n\nTldr: Better safe than sorry. You either have profit or the unknown."

Knowing or un-knowingly people make the stock market their gambling machine. \n\nMy advise to you is to make the stock market your learning machine first and then learn to use your knowledge to make money. Without overwhelming you here are a few things you can focus on:\n1.) Learn why a stock is good for you to trade. Don't just get in because you overheard someone's opinion.\n2.) Learn some risk management. Risk management is King, and never forget that. Risk management is one of the fundamental building blocks to trading/investing/entrepreneurship that is kept regardless of how much experience you gain.\n3.) Don't be so worried about strategies. Find one strategy focus on it and then with experience, you'll learn what you like, dislike, and can improve on.\n\nGood luck on your journey."

If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, Ill try to answer everything.\\n\\nToday we will look through the basics of Teslas business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for TSLAs stock using discounted free cashflow.\\n\\nThis is not financial advice and I do not own shares in TSLA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.\\n\\nFirst lets review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **85%** of their sales comes from **Automotive Sales**. Another **3%** comes from **Automotive Leasing**. **Energy generation and storage** makes up for **5%** and the remaining **6%** are **Services and** **Other.**\\n\\nFor the valuation:\\n\\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required retur'",

Investors then use company valuation to decide buy or sell which then rebalance the whole supply and demand. TSLA shares are in excessive demand now and it will be for many years to come. EV market is just beginning to expand and in the next ten years it will take about 30-40 percent of the auto market. You can guess how much TSLA will be capturing of that market. Existing automakers are not a threat because they have a whole infrastructure built around regular cars and it will take them many years just build infrastructure to produce as many ev cars. All of you that are doing company fundamentals right now are just going to be missing out on the gain you can have by going long with TSLA. Don\u2019t forget if autonomous driving start being implemented in the next 10 years you will wish you invested in TSLA today price. There is no company like TSLA out there"

And the closer they get to it the exponentially worse their value becomes in comparison when trading the value of the contract itself. And if the trade doesn't go in your favour by the deadline you lose 100% of your investment. \n\nBut there are ways to use them that are lower risk too. For example, if I'm entering a trade with shares and decide I'm happy to risk 10% of my investment and put a stop loss there I could have instead took whatever money that 10% loss would have represented and purchased calls with it instead. Or if I buy 100 shares I can lower the risk of the trade by also buying a Put to cap my max loss instead. \n\nIn these scenarios options buy you time instead of time working against you because a stop loss just triggers. Whereas with options you get until expiry for the trade to recover.\n\nThat's barely scratching the surface of greeks and options strategies. \n\nAnd in that lies the main risk. People trading options that don't understand what they are doing, get lucky, get addicted, keep going and then eventually hit a big loss and it's all gone.\n\nLike sure that Tesla trade you provide as an example was a great trade with a decent amount of time given to it and they took profits. But if you're in certain communities you'll see people do trades like that then YOLO the entire thing into a 0 DTE SPY option for a FOMC meeting, get it wrong and goodbye money.

     "Ok I\u2019m an options trader and will clarify some misconceptions here. \n\nLike all asset classes there are riskier strategies and not. Just like stock trading there are riskier stocks and not so risky stocks. I would actually consider a buy and hold strategy of SPY (or any other stock) to be a riskier strategy than the way I trade options. \n\nThe guy bought a call on TSLA out of the money expiring in Sept. The risks are that the stock drops. It may never recover and because of time decay even if it goes back up he may still lose money (or all or most of his investment) if there isn\u2019t enough time left to hit the strike price. An option is priced according to five \u201cGreeks\u201d. Delta, theta, gamma, Vega and rho. You should have a good grasp of the Greeks before touching options. \n\nMost people who invest in stocks look for one way to profit. The stock needs to go up. (Or you can short but I gather most people don\u2019t short stocks as it\u2019s more complicated.) As a net short options trader I can profit in any market environment, bearish, slightly bearish, neutral, bullish or extremely bullish. I have strategies I can employ for whatever market environment. I also can limit my max loss on any one trade and believe it or not reduce volatility and risk as compared to a simple buy and hold strategy. I control probability of success and amount of profit and loss. There are trade offs for each of course but you just need to know what you\u2019re doing and appropriately size your positions and trades. \n\nSo the bottom line is it isn\u2019t that \u201coptions trading is risky\u201d. It\u2019s how it\u2019s employed. For example investors in SVB who have all of their money in one stock would\u2019ve lost all of their investment employing a buy and hold strategy. Similarly the investor who shorted puts would\u2019ve had their whole account wiped out and then some  if they over leveraged. The issue isn\u2019t so much with options trading as it is with position sizing. That is what gets people into trouble. \n\nThe OP thinks that this is free or easy money. Nothing is free or easy. Everything has trade offs. As a successful options trader I don\u2019t worry about how much I can make. I worry about how much I can lose. And I size my position and max loss potential to reflect that. In my years of trading stocks and options I can tell you that being a net short options trader gives you a far higher risk adjusted return than a simply indexing strategy."

     "I believe most options expire worthless. As I recall the number might be about 75% because of how the math works out. There's also some things with options you have to worry about that you don't have to with normal stocks. Time decay is one of them. As time goes on, your options get more and more worthless if they don't move the right way in price. \n\n>This week Tesla jumped to $170, and that alone netted him $7k profit.\n\nRisk $14,000 expiring as $0, and you made $7,000 (assuming he sold as soon as the 7k in profit hit, if not it will likely go to 0). Does that sound like a fair deal to you? \n\nYou can do the exact same thing by just buying the stock. The only thing options give you is more leverage, but they take the benefits away by charging you in things like time decay, implied volatility, and market expectations. \n\nWith all that said, there are some far less risky ways to play options, but just buying them is not 1 of them."

     "Its a solid company but I bet it's going to drop more. You could sell and cut your loss because it's anyone's guess which way it will go now and I suspect it's overbought significantly. That said, it could also go up. Its hard to say because Tesla is a cult stock with massive hype. If it didn't have cult status and hype most people would tell you it's going to drop, a lot. The problem with hype is that you don't know when it will end. Probably why even though people load up on Tesla shorts they keep getting burned. But it will stop eventually. The graph can't bend over back on itself. It has to correct eventually.\n\nThe problem I see with Tesla at this value is that it's not something everyone has or is looking to get. Apple and Amazon, I get it. Everyone uses prime. Everyone wants an iPhone.\n\nNot everyone wants a Tesla and when I drive I still see only a handful of them. A lot of car owners still have problems with the idea of getting a Tesla. Especially truck owners which is a huge part of the market. If they had it, maybe they would deserve this valuation. I think people are pricing in future market dominance before it's happened. It's become very speculative.\n\nYour only other option. (other than sell or hold) is to start averaging your price down. I would do it slowwwwwly. That means increasing your exposure to risk though and you're potentially in for a long time. You put in smaller amounts of money at lower prices and start averaging cost out to increase your position. I would only do this if you're leaning towards going long and you have money to burn. Do it in several price levels. Start with a small piece and increase as the dip expands. You will know when it's going back to steady and back up.\n\nBe wary of prices that are parabolic. Be sure it's going to continue or stay away from it. People like to say on reddit \"stonks go up\" and they do, but they also go down. The majority of stocks are not a straight arrow up and it's entirely possible that some levels will not be seen again. That's true for the majority of stocks. When they are exploring new prices, it's risky to buy in.\n\nOne thing you can do, is you can watch the volume indicator and check sentiments around the stock in the next few days. If they start trickling off, that's a bad sign.\n\nLearn the lesson from this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel for you and anyone I see who makes this kind of post. I've been exactly where you are and it cost me 5 figures. I waited a long time when I bought near the top and eventually sold out. 3 years later and it still hasn't retraced. It just keeps hitting lower highs. Maybe next year."

If they can iron out all their production issues, build a better infrastructure to support the practicality of mass electric car ownership (better repair and parts availability, more charging stations, faster charging, etc.), and expand their battery production capabilities into large scale battery banks I think the company could go even higher (but I don\u2019t think you can price those \u201cifs\u201d in just yet). \n\nAlso I\u2019ve seen a lot of people mention their over air updates, and that\u2019s not even their tech.

It\u2019s probably either coming starting with the Fed this week (as much as I HATE this because it\u2019s simply way too simple), or we probably wind up managing to tag the 4300\u2019s, then reverse around Feb OPEX\u2026but to me at the very least, the secular/long-term bear-nista believer is going to be greatly disappointed unless the S&P loses the March 2021 local lows again."

How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.\\n\\nEveryone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.\\n\\nWell, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $2500 pre-split).\\n\\nNow TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $2500.\\n\\nTo all those TSLA FOMO-er\\'s, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the \"company of the future\" that has a valuation potential that can\\'t be captured (ie.

     "I was invested in QCOM in 1998 and many tech stocks during the 1st DOT-COM bubble.  SEBL, NTAP, CREE...all good companie. CREE, NTAP and QCOM still exist and are doing very well.  SEBL was bought by oracl maybe 7 to 10 years ago.\n\nBut companies can do very well and still lose 90% of their stock value.  Every one of those stocks, and in fact the entire NASDAQ lost 90% of its value from its peak in the 2000 NASDAQ bubble.  Some of those companies have not seen their 2000 bubble stock prices despite running perfectly good companies and experiencing 2 more 'tech bubbles' in the preceding 20 years.\n\nNTAP has reached about half its 2000 stock price in the preceding 20 years, CREE about the same it looks like.  QCOM has done the best-- it just recently exceeded its 2000 all time high, but it took 20 years to do so, meaning if you bought the stock any time near its bubble peak and held through the crash thinking it would someday return a value, you would have been right.  After 20 years of holding,  in the last couple months you would have finally seen a small return, a much worse return than holding treasuries bonds, but not a loss I guess.\n\nThe point is valuation does matter, and a business can be a good business and run perfectly fine and in a great environment for what it sells, but if you buy at an extreme premium you may not see a return on your money, even after holding for 20 years and that company performing its business well .\n\nTSLA may very well be a great company, but it seems like it is priced like as if its going to be the only car company in the world with high margins to boot.  It feels very much like QCOM to me- in fact QCOM split 4-1 after a relentless run up and then immediately began to tank, bringing the market down with it shortly after.\n\nQCOM had a patent on a tremendous and pioneering technology that other companies had to pay (and still do) royalties on, this was challenged and won in many court battles.  A technology that would go in billions of phones eventually and was/is a very well run business.\n\n  I don't even know if the same could be said for TSLA honestly, they may be well run, but they don't have a patent that they can force other companies to use or pay on..but in any case, that's beside the point.  The point is that valuations really do matter.  The average investor in 2000 because people were so heavily weighted in technology lost 85% of their portfolio value.  That takes a long time to recover from.  You have to make 100% gain if you lose 50% of your money, then suddenly you realize you are almost 50 years old....don't waste time, it feels like you have forever, but it goes fast, I promise."

Thinking about selling out due to its clear short term momentum overbought vibe, ended up opening an extremely lucky short pos on Friday that was slightly bigger than my share position cuz the stock looked like the momentum had a clear horizontal resistance. \\n\\nThe immense sell pressure next week would truly mean the discount of a lifetime for long term bulls, would it not?\\n\\nI mean, the company is the same, fundamentals are the same.

There was a similar thread about this weeks ago, with almost all negative feedback.\n\nI think Rivian has potential for a few reasons. \n\n1. They are targeting a customer base that is largely ignored by Tesla and other EV companies.\n2. They have contracts with the off-road race industry already, along with their own race circuit.\n3. They are making specialty vehicles for outdoor type people.\n4. Rivian is a more widely known name than many of the other non-Tesla EV companies.\n5. The Amazon contract is lucrative and does not mean that UPS, USPS, and FedEx will necessarily go with competitors.\n6. Comparing them to long time companies like Ford and GM is not really a fair comparison. Ford and GM aren't going anywhere, they are expanding on an already solid product line.\n\nRivian would definitely be a long-term investment. While I do not think it will expand as much as Tesla did, I do think it will grow a lot. I am not an expert in stocks but think that there is more to choosing lucrative stocks than just the number crunching. There are real world parts that determine success and value."

Right now Apple could make an Apple branded monitor with the same design motif as its laptops and sell tons of them.  It would not even have to stock them in Apple stores, maybe just a demo model with ordering online.  It got rid of monitors because the it is a low margin product.  In fact because of low margins, Cook has basically disassembled what used to be the Apple hardware ecosystem with its printers, routers, monitors, and such.\n\nIt does not make sense for Apple to get into a business that requires huge capital outlays, is very cyclical, and often has low to no profits"

     "UNH\nUnited Health is a steady rocket ship. Check out the chart since about 2008. It\u2019s not a sexy stock but it\u2019s a true money maker especially if you want a long term position.  Its stock chart looks like a high flying tech stock, not like an insurance stock. Here\u2019s why this is so good and any health insurance stock for that matter. When Obama came into office he created Obamacare.  Obama care basically allowed the health insurance companies to write alot of the current government regulations.  One thing they actually created as a result of all this new legislation is technically \u201cprice fixing\u201d. While they will never admit to this, this is the reality. Price fixing is illegal in every industry and companies get fined for it all the time. In this case, basically the government is signing off on this so called price fixing although they will never call it that.\nHow do I know this you might ask. Well I spent over 20 years in the investment industry and was self employed for most of that time and a lot of my clients were some of the biggest brands in the investment industry.  But that\u2019s not really why I know this. I know this because I was and still am a business owner and I have had to buy a lot of health insurance over the years.  Prior to Obamacare the health insurance market was competitive, you could shop around to get the best deal. When my existing health insurer would jack up our rate on the renewal, we would just switch carriers and it would bring the rate back down. Obamacare eliminated that competition among insurers. So now when my health insurer jacks my rate every year and I go look for another insurance carrier, they are oddly at the same jacked up rate my current insurer is at. So no longer a cost saving benefit to switching carriers and we\u2019re forced into annual increases no matter what.\nThe health insurance companies have been claiming they struggle financially but if you look at the chart. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case. Their charts are more like high flying tech companies but with a couple of main differences\u2026 low to cheap P/E ratios and a government backed price fixing theme with recurring locked in revenues that grow on top of themselves year after year. \nJust food for thought and sorry for the long dissertation\u2026 lol"

While GM and Ford have been closing factories for lack of computer chips, Tesla has been racking up record sales every quarter.  In 2022, they sold double the amount of card in 2020.\n\nOne reason is the technology dominance used in Tesla manufacturing.  The other is they own their own supply chain. About the only thing not owned is the battery.  Chip issues impacted Tesla too, but they rewrote the software for the chips they could get. They also could do this because they didn't outsource their programmers, something just about every car company was doing to save money. Their future EV cars will be built on the gas powered car's manufacturing processes.  I could go on and on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Note:  I don't own a Tesla. But I am a programmer for a tech company.

You are aiming for % of total AUTO share because your largest market isn't current EV buyers but getting the guy who wants to purchase an Audi or BMW ICE vehicle.\n\nHyundai IONIQ 6 is a nice vehicle. The problem is it is an unsustainable business model. They are not profitable and sell few units. If the objective was to sell few units and lose money selling a good EV, Hyundai is winning. \n\nChevy Bolt, lol. I love how you use forecasted Chevy Bolt sales for the year versus Tesla current Q1 sales. Why do you not use the forecasted Tesla sales for the year? Instead you want to make it seem close by comparing a quarterly amount versus the yearly amount? FYI, Tesla is expected to do 1.8-1.9 million EV sales for 2023. Chevy Bolt is expected to do 70,000 for 2023. In which way is this close?\n\nTesla is cutting prices because during COVID when everyone had money, they continued to increase the prices of their vehicles. With a looming recession and economic downturn with higher rates, it was unsustainable for Tesla to sell their vehicles at that same price. It's common sense. \n\n\"Cybertruck isn't out yet.\"\n\nLiterally coming out by this year.\n\n\"Model 2 unknown date.\"  \n\n\nExpected to release within the next year or two considering Tom Zhu has said they expect Giga Monterrey to start operating quicker than Shanghai (which only took \\~year to begin manufacturing vehicles.) If they manage to do this, no other auto company will come close and be profitable selling a $25k EV outside of maybe BYD (which doesn't really report EV numbers separately so it's tough to say for sure)."

Meanwhile Tesla has been minting margins other car manufacturers haven\u2019t seen in decades with an ROE of over 30%. That massive free cash flow is largely being reinvested back into R&D and capex in order to continue to grow faster and stay technologically ahead of everyone else.\n\n2021 sales grew 70% and 2022 grew 50%. Looks like estimates are for 25-30% growth this year off an already high base. \n\nAdd on to this that unlike every other OEM they have almost no advertising or distribution help to achieve these results. So as far as I can see the numbers don\u2019t tell me that Tesla is losing anything. At most you can say they don\u2019t have a 100% monopoly on full size EVs. \n\nFull disclosure: I have no investments in TSLA or any other OEM."

     "Yes, Tesla will continue to lose market share in an industry that is growing exponentially.  It wasn't long ago that the EV market was a niche market that was dominated by Tesla.  Keep in mind that as other players, including legacy car manufacturers, increase their EV offerings, Tesla's market share will continue to erode.  Would you care to make a bet on who the top EV manufacturer will be in ten years?  I would bet the answer is Tesla, although they will likely produce a minority of EVs by then.  Also, in ten years most new cars will be EVs, so we have gone from TSLA being the only significant player in a tiny market five years ago to TSLA still being the top producer in a market that includes most retail automobiles.\n\nBoth things can be true, Tesla can lose market share while still growing at a very high rate because the industry is in its infancy."

  "Text": "b\"Hi I was reading paypal investor's update. I didn't find any thing alarming in there yes operating margins is guided down by .25% and they are having revenue growth of still 7% even in this environment. When the fed pivots and people Start spending out money they estimate will increase as gdp will grow. Yes there new active accounts going dow  but they said in before that's not their goal. And earning is going up atleast 12% for next few years. If Visa is trading  at 32 gaap earning to priceand mastercard is trading at 37 gaap earning to price and I think pay do deserve atleast 26 gaap earning to price which will take them to $90. I am heavily invested in PayPal my average is $110 and I am kinda getting worried now. Is there a hope?\"",

     "Let me give you some good advice friend.\n\nLets say you have 100k invested into a stock, say PayPal. It drops 50% in value and you're sitting at 50k. You held your 50k for awhile but the stock isn't doing much and you're worried. You obviously don't want to lose 50k, but it's already gone mate.\n\nNow you can either let that 50k sit there and maybe the stock rebounds eventually in a few years, or you can take that 50k and put it in something that is actually moving up, say, anyone who says the word AI. In a few months, that 50k could be 70k in say, Google, DraftKings, Meta, etc, or you can sit there in PayPal, with it still at 50k in a few months.\n\nHere's the thing bud. You clearly don't have faith in PayPal like you used to. You need to learn how to sell. Ask yourself this. Do you think Paypal will perform better than other stocks? Obviously your answer is no, so why are you holding PayPal? You're missing out on way better gains out there.\n\nSomething retail investors love to do. They cut their winners and hold their losers. That.. *is a losing strategy my friend.*\n\nedit: To put it in another way.. Money invested into stocks are fluid. Liquidity, right? Well.. you're playing a solid in a liquid world if you don't sell/trade out your bad investments. The only stocks you should be holding, are ones you feel *bullish* on."

     "> but I'd argue that the hyper-growth side of the market has already experienced it's 2001-style reckoning. \n\nLook at the companies. Most are still far from cheap, and a lot of them are still very expensive. Not only have the loses of many increased, growth has slowed and now you have FFR of 5%. Given those backgrounds, it is a miracle that most of them are not down even more. \n\n>There is an absolute fuck-ton of money in money-markets, T-bills, and cash. People are bearish. I know we've just experienced quite a rally through Q1 but there are still many, many growth stocks that are down very low. We've had some very bad news recently with OPEC, bad jobs numbers, SVB, but - at some point - the market will begin looking past these things and start looking ahead. You could get in when it's more clear that conditions are improving - likely the safer bet - or you could start really digging to find potential value in the broken dreams of 2022 to catch the most upside.\n\nYou know why there is a lot of money there? Because they get 4-5% risk free rate. Why would you buy some random company that has loses or dilutes the hell out of shareholders, when you get an acceptable return without any risk or work. Furthermore money doesn't have to come back. Retail participation in Japan for example is still not back after the crash in 1989.\n\n>SOFI, DDOG, ENPH, WOLF, INVZ, CRWD, are a few. I've only opened small positions in a few of these because I'm a pretty cautious investor,  \n\nDo a DCF with 5% FFR and the growth decline in those companies. They are still very expensive."

Tesla energy and probably software are going to be massive businesses for them also. \nAs a shareholder I still do have concerns, the stock is way out ahead of itself and a bunch of traders and probable weak hands have jumped in. Also Tesla really needs to invest in their service department, and quality control in manufacturing still a concern. But for all his shortcomings, Elon musk really is sort of a visionary genius and is running circles around these paper pusher traditional automotive and energy executives. Without Tesla none of these auto companies would have even planned to seriously move on EVs by now, and renewable energy plus storage wouldn\u2019t have near the same momentum.

They sell vehicles with ten year warranties, profitably.  Think about that.  Then think about the fact Tesla is constantly at the bottom of quality rankings.  \n\nSeveral years ago I had the same theory you propose: that monsters like Toyota and GM could use their auto making scale to squeeze Tesla.  Yet they sat and did nothing... for years.  They gave this huge lead role to Tesla.  Still, it feels different now.  EV is part of the public consciousness.  Older relatives are actively seeking out EV's and hybrids from their favorite old fashioned brands, even though it makes zero sense for them. \n\nTesla reminds me of how Netflix and Amazon ran up big numbers, but people overlook the fact they each were doing so against zero competitors.  Tesla has had no real competition... so far.  A buddy of my father said the test of the fighter is in the arena."

     "Yes, and this is coming from a Tesla shareholder (though one with a more recently reduced allocation to them) - people will say they are years ahead of the competition, and this is true, but the likes of Toyota, GM, Nissan, and Hyundai sell a lot more vehicles than a company like BMW, despite BMW being ahead of them on tech. It's as simple as people not always wanting to pay for tech, like in China they'll gladly take a Nio with slightly worse range for $10 grand less...and once these other manufacturers get above the low bar required to really compete on full electric, they will eat into market share. Whether Tesla can outdo them in manufacturing efficiency so they can compete on cost as well as anyone is yet to be seen, but building vehicles there are only so many places that efficiencies can be gained, and a lot of companies have gotten really good at wringing out those efficiencies.\n\nAlso, listen to Musk at the battery day, the goal of Tesla is not to generate massive profits, it's to generate just enough profits to stay in business. While this is good from a reinvestment standpoint, and thus staying ahead of the curve, it doesn't scream earnings growth. \n\nIn terms of AI, the big question is whether Tesla is really almost at level 5, and whether we will ever get to level 6. \n\nI'm still a believer but my outlook is realistic, a bit tempered, and takes risk into account. Like you have to realize that expectations for them have been set so high that if they aren't utterly dominating in coming years it will be deemed a failure. Their stock price has basically gone full No Man's Sky, so now they need to deliver on the hype. And they might, worth owning some for that. But I sure as hell wouldn't put 80% of my net worth into them."

     "No.\n\nThe market is right at the tipping point of witnessing a massive shift towards EVs. Tesla is poised to capitalize on this growth WITHOUT sacrificing declining sales of ICE vehicles (unlike every other legacy automaker).\n\nFor example, Tesla\u2019s closest competitor VW, will see its legacy business shrink as its EV business expands. This is fine for VW, as it won\u2019t hurt the bottom line as long as EV growth keeps pace with its declining ICE sales. But Tesla will experience growth from rapid EV adoption without having its core business shrink into oblivion.\n\nEven if the legacy automakers are able to make competitive EVs, the widespread and rapid adoption of EVs mean that Tesla could lose a percentage of marketshare and still increase its sales by astronomical levels. This is what happened with the iPhone. It lost marketshare to its competitors over the past ten years. How much did that hurt Apple\u2019s phone business? None. In fact, it\u2019s phone business grew significantly and made them a ton of money. The share price of Apple has risen accordingly."

Moved from a large house in North Scottsdale to a small house in a town far outside of Phoenix to regenerate some savings, but clearly he can be defined as being 'The Guy.'   I have absolutely no idea what the top will be in the SPY or TSLA, but somebody will end up being 'The Guy' there also.  This euphoria/insanity can go on for a long time or it could end tomorrow.

     "Tesla makes 9.2k on average from their cars. The discount for the Model 3 in China alone is around 6k, and even higher for their higher end models.\n\nGiven that most of their money was made in China anyway, that is a 65% margin decline on the Chinese market right here. So Tesla needs to grow 200% in China just to keep earnings even.\n\nAccording to Troy Teslike on Twitter (who is a Tesla bull), the backlog has gone down hugely. My prediction last year was that Tesla would stop growing in H1 2023, with margins declining starting in Q2 2023. I am still sticking to that. The share price correction can get really ugly here if that comes true.\n\nEdit: corrected decline"

They have a ton of headwinds and tailwinds in terms of margins recently, almost impossible to predict what will happen.\n\nTailwinds:\n\n* Bigger economies of scale\n* Negative margins from Berlin/Texas flipping positive\n* Material costs coming back down to 2019 levels\n* FSD NA-wide release one-time deferred revenue recognition\n* FSD NA-wide release probable increase in adoption and definite increase in immediate recognition on new FSD sales\n* Increasing numbers of MIC sales outside of China (more profitable than sales inside China, especially after price cuts)\n* Inventory decrease in EU/NA\n* Larger share of production coming from more efficient factories\n* Continuous cost cutting on manufacturing techniques\n* IRA incentives on ~50% of NA sold units (not technically going to Tesla, but may increase demand and allow price increases)\n* IRA incentives on battery production (may not go into effect until Q2 though)\n* Model S/X being sold outside of NA again\n* No more SBC from CEO compensation plan\n\nHeadwinds:\n\n* 60K units in transit at end of quarter, expected to grow even further for 1-3 more quarters (unlike legacy OEMs, Tesla doesn't recognize a sale until delivery)\n* Discounts during last two weeks of December worldwide\n* Price cuts in China in October and January\n* Declining regulatory credits\n* Soon to be announced new factory investments\n* COVID issues in China factory in December\n* Chinese New Year shutdown in China factory in February\n* Potentially looming recession and high interest rates may slow demand globally\n\nProbably forgot a few, but it's nearly impossible to say anything worthwhile about what the ultimate effect will be. If I had to guess, I'd expect margins to come down a bit during Q4 and even more during Q1 down to, and then start trending upwards again."

Each hour is about $10.32 so for every minute you spend asking reddit if you should buy, youve lost $0.17/share. Dont question the meme stock. It actually has a product that is in high demand and the stock went nowhere in the previous 10 years (floated around $100-400) and at the time, it was undervalued because 99% of people didnt understand it.\\n\\nEdit: this post is NOT suggesting to buy now. But its also not suggesting to sell or wait for the dip to buy either. Make your own decisions. The risk is very high. If you invest now, it could go up another 5-10% to only drop 30%. No one knows at this point. Theres a lot of catalysts coming up in September like battery day and Q3 earnings. Dont be surprised if we see a sell off before or immediately after. Theres very high expectations for the million mile battery. \\n\\nAs always, do your own research and invest based'",

     "I think we are in, how do you say, a bubble but a bubble with many smaller bubbles within in it. Sort of like a large bubble encasing many smaller ones. Anyone of these bubbles popping could cause a contagion effect. What is concerning is the fact this economy has been injected with cash from the actions due to the pandemic. Was injecting cash a good thing? Eh, hindsight is 20/20..am I right? Rhetorical of course, we simply don\u2019t 100% know. I do know many folks and businesses alike are using these funds, wages and savings to push up the market all while collecting money from these investments. Might be an explanation to where some of the missing work force went. It\u2019s very interesting using analytics and techniques to review market data but it\u2019s human behavior at the core. Right now everyone who has skin in the game are at best trying to find what will pop first. With so much fear and confusion it\u2019s like the fed thinks we need something familiar to happen in the market to know which way is up. IMO not gonna happen. This inflation is going to stick. Why? Too much money chasing too few goods. Slap the working force and unemployment goes up. Thing is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the working class with the money. So I see high unemployment and moderate inflation 4-5%, but a big demand in growth for services. So I\u2019ll call it Flowflation. Ew, how do we get out of this? Policy to detach from energy costs and dare I say it drop interest rates and some how get the rich closer to us in terms of income. I\u2019m also skeptical that something is lurking in the shadows of some heavy weight countries. That\u2019s my Ted talk thanks for reading \ud83d\ude4f"

It is a pure gambling machine based on technical analysis. \n\nhttps://talkmarkets.com/content/nasdaq-bitcoin-gold-among-beneficiaries-of-falling-rates-expectations?post=389768\n\nThis is an article that sends shivers down my spine. First this part:\n\n\"The market is thus betting that we have reached a peak in terms of rate hikes and that from here looser monetary policy should follow.\n\nThe Fed, SNB, and BoE all hikes interest rates this week, but the message from these banks was the same: more increases may be required, not will be if inflationary pressures persist.\"\n\nWhere on earth are people getting this idea? The Fed is doing something rather clever. They are providing liquidity at ever increasing rates. Meaning you can have money, but it will cost you. They are completely misunderstanding looser monetary policy.\n\nSecondly, the idea that you can read the market as an uptrend because of some technical analysis is ludicrous. Technical analysis works until it does not work, and then it does not work really badly. People have since 2008 only seen a market that goes up. That is scary as it implies we have a generation of \"investors\" that don't understand that markets can go down hard.\n\nIt will burst, but it will be death by a thousand cuts."

We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales with 150k+ deliveries in its first year out of the gates with G'",

Now that it's been another year, here are the results using the closing price Friday 1-8-21 and the closing price Tuesday (intended to make this post Wednesday but forgot).\\n\\n*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (% change uses full price).

     "Tesla isn't overvalued, it's just very optimistically valued. If a number of things go well, it could very well 10X in value over the next decade.\n\nThe risk really is that historically TSLA drops hard, stagnates and such so your return over a given time period can very a lot. Hence I use stock + theta positive strategies to help ensure that even if it isn't moving much it still does generally well. This works because IV is high since people think it could go up 4X it's current value or more while others think it could go down 4X it's current value or more. While IV isn't so high that it's far in meme stock territory.\n\nMy recommendation? Keep it at 2.9% and allow it to go up to 10% of your portfolio before you start selling (IE: The \"Cathie Woods\" way). Also DCA into it to increase it over time (IE increase it by 0.1% or something each month).\n\nDo it well and TSLA should treat you kindly even if you hold for a decade and it ends up at $1000 a share in the end."

But today I decided to cover my first investment and sold 13 shares at 912$. It feels good to have 18 free shares. I think the price will come down eventually and I will buy back at some point. I have the dame feeling as I had with Beyond Meat (bought at 69$ and sold at 151$) at the beginning (only 1.500$ initial investment, a good profit).\\n\\nI am all in Tesla and share the same vision, but the hype, and the crazy rally is... too much.\\n\\nI wish you all the best!'",

Which by the way the F150 alone has more market share that all of TSLA's vehicles combined.\n\nTSLA for absolute sure has an advantage with FSD right now - but that's almost a non factor for years to come.

Basically about the nature of structures across time in changing environments; they have to update to keep up, but also conserve most of what works. After long enough, the whole thing will be very complex, and there are going to be systems in place that are costly and outdated.\n\nThe barrier to entry for a new player boldly entering a massive and complicated market is precisely that they lack this type of infrastructure, and therefore resources and knowledge etc. However if they make it far enough there becomes a tipping point where that lack of infrastructure becomes a massive advantage. You can scale up operations in a way that makes sense in the modern environment. Basically the old dog new tricks problem.\n\nIn my opinion, Tesla is passing that tipping point. Their manufacturing is incredible. There will be a day in the not so distant future that other automakers won't be able to manufacture the number of vehicles tesla can, and certainly not as cheaply."

     "With all due respect, this type of post makes me want to go buy Tesla stock. \n\nYou\u2019re right they don\u2019t get the same amount of sales as traditional car makers. But they offer arguably the best EVs on the market. \n\nTheir fans aren\u2019t delusional. It\u2019s marketing. Same reason iPhone sales never slowed down despite Android users having all the \u201ctop features\u201d before them. The issue is here is Tesla has the marketing of Apple, and the \u201ccost\u201d of the android. \n\nWhat do you mean by \u201cno actual data\u201d? Are they supposed to release statistical results of products years before they release them? \n\nAutopilot is getting sued and rightfully so. There have been accidents and deaths. But there is a difference between their autopilot and self driving packages. And the thing is, no other car maker has an auto pilot software package that comes close to Tesla. Yes there are assisted driving packages, but Tesla also has over 5 years of data for their autopilot and self driving features. That data is the most valuable thing for them, as it will keep their software years ahead of the competition. Would I personally use autopilot? No. But is Tesla the world lead in automated driving? Yes. \n\nHonestly, you need to define what \u201ccatch up\u201d means. Are traditional car makers going to catch up in EV sales? Yes. Most carmakers have begun the process of transitioning fully electric. And have bigger portfolios. Will traditional car makers portfolios stop or slow Tesla sales? I\u2019ve come to the belief that they won\u2019t dent Teslas sales at all. Most traditional car makers are going to be fully electric between 2025-2035. Tesla has another 2 years of sales ahead before competitors get close, and 2 years to accomplish one of their many aggressive goals. \n\nI agree Tesla is overvalued by traditional metrics. But how do you value a company that forced an industry to change all of their products, is the leader in autonomous driving, and is cutting costs aggressively. I don\u2019t know how and I stopped trying to figure out how."

     "Yup. In this thread: the sentiment keeping the stock afloat.  \n\nYou will constantly be told how amazing the company is, and they are pushing the rest of the car industry to go into EV, which I agree, is great, but nobody can really explain why the price is $850, and not $600. At $600, that would still make it the most valuable car company in the world, while delivering 1/5 of the cars. \n\n I really like what the company is doing, but it's a very expensive stock. \n\nI've worked as an engineer in automotive, and I can tell you scaling is hard. People think the more cars you make, the cheaper everything gets (economies of scale) but it also gives your suppliers more leverage to negotiate prices each year. \n\nTesla is looked at both as a growth company that can grow 50% year over year for 10 years (going from 500k to 1M cars is easier than 1M to 2M) and simultaneously as this behemoth that will make 20 million cars while under-cutting on price, while some how maintaining great margins (I know, they want to sell the car for $30k, and self driving for $10k subscription). \n\nScaling is somehow considered to be easy because of their giga factories and \"they are a tech company\", but Elon musk was on TV asking for nickel for batteries. Meanwhile, every car company is rushing into EV. I guess tesla margins are immune to supply chain constraints and competition. This is where those supplier negotiations squeeze margins. \n\nOn top of all this, they haven't run into their first major recall yet.  It will happen, and without a dealer network, and long lead times on repairs now, it's anybody's guess on how they will go about doing it. \n\nThey also haven't faced a unionized work force or labor strike. \n\nPeople are also acting like the first self driving car company will be the only one, but given the rapid pace of deep learning and churn of expertise out of the company (other companies poaching tsla engineers), it's not reasonable to assume that moat is durable.  Maybe a few years advantage, at most. Many point to road data as a big moat, but training models with less data is a very active field of research. Saying that others won't figure this out is betting against the best math minds in the world, and Nvidia, amazon and Google.  \n\nThey are also acting like tesla demand is infinitely large. They haven't had to deal with inventory yet, but I promise they will eventually miss sales goals and will have unsold vehicles. When that will happen is difficult to say. \n\nTsla bulls brush all this off as \"it just won't happen, tesla will win. Just drive one, and you'll know it's different\". I had one for a while, but I can still see the business for what it is."

The VW fit and finish was great.  It drove very well. feels and looks a lot like a ICE car, and the price was great. Even more so when factoring in tax credits. This will be a great bridge vehicle for getting ICE customers into EV. A few cons with the VW was the software, but that is likely to improve with OTA.  VW partnership with battery co QS looks promising.  TSLA may be the iphone of EV, but I see VW being the Samsung.  It will be interesting how tsla responds.'",

     "I own Tesla shares, so you \\*could\\* claim that I'm biased, BUT my stock purchase/choice was based (among other factors) in my strong preference for Tesla over VW (and other competitors for now). I'm going to stick only to the car related stuff here, not the stock:\n\n1. I test drove both. They are both fine. However, VW feels chintzy to me. The reason why no one wanted an electric car for the longest time is that chintziness (edit: and low range). Tesla made people want to buy an electric car, not only for the environment, but also for their own enjoyment and the pride of ownership. I was an owner of a VW (not electric, obviously), and I can't get excited about having another. If I were to be buying Tesla, then yes.\n2. VW's weakest point has always been the software/the electric. THAT was always the glitchiest, most annoying part of their cars. So I'm a bit concerned with them going full electric when they couldn't even implement a non-glitchy software in their Jetta. In other words, I cannot even compare Tesla's software to VWs. Or I can... and Tesla wins hands down.\n3. For me, the aesthetics are incomparable. Tesla feels like a spaceship. I admit it's a different price range, but the inside is incredibly comfortable and aesthetically beautiful. And I'm still impressed that they pulled off the falcon wing doors.\n4. My four year old daughter tested both with me. She doesn't know that we are peasants who can't afford either of these at the moment:), but she told me to \"go to your computer and order Tesla right now!\""

The current economic climate leaves few places to store and increase wealth, so people are flocking to Tesla as a future-proof investment. The financials of the company may never match the stock price but the investors don't care.

Vast majority of Chinese people live in high rises, so there are benefits there vs installing EV chargers in every parking spot. Although eventually, on a long term horizon every new building will have chargers, or at least a heavy percentage of parking spots will have them.\n\n2) The car are reliable, at least according to this  [https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nio-leads-ev-quality-jd-power-finds-china](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nio-leads-ev-quality-jd-power-finds-china) \n\n3) The SUVs support the dynamics of a family + kids + one set of parents fitting into the car when going on a visit/to the mall/etc...\n\n4) Money isn't a pressing problem anylonger as it was just a few months ago\n\n5) NIO houses are an exclusivity technique, which usually turned out well if the product/service is solid.\n\nAs for potential problems:\n\nThere is competition from other Chinese EV brands. Tesla as well of course, Tesla's brand and reputation eclipses anything else in the EV world. \n\nThe cars are expensive. I doubt vast majority of NIO SUVs are purchased by single families that can easily afford them. More likely it is a family + help from extended family to buy the car, with expectation that it will be used for the benefit of all. The costs will have to trend down over time."

They just have to copy.\n\nI would imagine that Elon made a deal with China on access to insanely cheap raw materials as well, and part of that deal is that the government could steal their IP, but not steal any branding or design language."

Tesla has already made big strides in battery technology, self-dricing cars, and electric vehicles. \n\nSo it probably doesn't matter too much if China steals Tesla IP. Obviously Tesla will prefer to profit off of the technology breakthroughs themselves but this is  technology that Tesla wants to be spread worldwide anyway. I don't know is Tesla's management actually cares as that much about profitability. But if you are worried China will outcompete Tesla, no need. Buying a Tesla is a status symbol, just like how Rolex watches can be replicated for cheaper, people will still buy the actual luxury item because a knockoff doesn't provide the same status symbol."

     ">The Chinese are known for ignoring international copyrights on intellectual property\n\nChina has certainly had problems with IP protection in the past but their reputation has been improving over time.\n\nIn 2014 they started setting up [specialised IP courts](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/09/chinas-intellectual-property-courts-a-procedural-overview.html) to better enforce IP protection. So far [foreigners have won 68% of cases](https://www.chinalawblog.com/2019/11/foreigners-win-68-of-cases-in-beijing-ip-court-how-to-use-this-to-your-advantage.html) in them. You've also seen companies like [ASML win](https://www.eenewsanalog.com/news/asml-wins-punitive-damages-chinese-ip-theft-case) in Chinese IP theft cases, and Qualcomm years ago started getting paid for their licenses.\n\nSo the premise that China is some lawless land where IP theft is rampant and without consequence isn't current.\n\nOn Tesla specifically, one of the reasons Tesla sells well is because it has a great brand. If you took all of its technology and put a different label on it, I don't think it'd sell as well.\n\nChina's also quite advanced with EVs -- they've got the [biggest EV battery manufacturer in the world](https://qz.com/1585662/how-catl-became-the-worlds-biggest-electric-car-battery-company/) with CATL, along with the [biggest electric vehicle manufacturer in the world](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-04-16/the-world-s-biggest-electric-vehicle-company-looks-nothing-like-tesla) with BYD (though a lot of this is buses).\n\n---\n\nEdit: Here's a good piece from The Economist in February 2019 on China and IP: [Chinese firms are not all serial intellectual-property thieves](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/02/09/chinese-firms-are-not-all-serial-intellectual-property-thieves)\n\n>Yet among Chinese firms, the mindset is starting to change\u2014as it eventually did among Japanese firms after they robbed America blind in the 1970s and 1980s. From humble beginnings (Mr Hu applied for his first patent in a half-built bungalow), China accounted for 44% of the world\u2019s patent filings in 2017, submitting twice as many applications as America, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Companies, mostly Chinese ones, sue each other over patents in China more than in any other country.\n\n>When foreigners do litigate in China, Rouse, a law firm, says they have a higher win rate in patent cases than domestic ones, and are awarded more damages overall. Such fines are low by international standards, but are improving: Alfred Dunhill, a British luxury brand, won a $1.4m payout in October over trademark infringement by a Chinese menswear brand called Danhuoli. In January, the ip court system was bolstered by the establishment of an appeals tribunal at the Supreme People\u2019s Court in Beijing.\n\n>The more inventive it is, the more protection benefits China. Huawei was the world\u2019s biggest filer of international patents in 2017; whatever misgivings there are about its loyalties to the Chinese state, it is hard to doubt its commitment to innovation. An executive at Alibaba notes that as Chinese firms expand globally, particularly in South-East Asia, they, too, suffer from having their ideas ripped off, making them keener to protect them. As China\u2019s economy weakens, says an executive of Beiqi Foton Motor, a vehicle manufacturer, his firm will need to protect its patents from rivals even more, to guard its share of a shrinking market.\n\n>Executives admit to gaping holes in the ip system, particularly in inland regions where local tribunals are subject to heavy-handed interference by provincial governments keen to shield local copycats. That is why some ip executives in China accept the rationale behind American arm-twisting. After all, they admit, if it were not for American pressure on intellectual property, China would not have come half as far. That is not to say they approve of Mr Trump\u2019s bombastic approach, which adds to the sense that America is trying to stifle China\u2019s rise. But the desire for change is both internally and externally driven. As one executive puts it, \u201cNo one likes to be called a thief\u2014not even kids.\u201d"

     "I wrote this 1 year ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/hip0kt7/\nmarket cap was $1.1 trillion\n\nI wrote this 2 months ago:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/it3xpyf/?context=3\nmarket cap was $644 billion\n\nToday market cap is: $385 billion\nThe reasons you mentioned are valid; but you left out China demand issues. I mentioned in both of my post above.   I believe China demand has somewhat plateaued. they will sell in record numbers in china in q4; but there are some headwinds:  the subsidy is gone in 2023.  more competition: notably the byd seal: they started selling in september 2022 and in november 2022: it sold 15K. Tesla sells about 10k (edit: model 3 per month.  So there is Model Y: but the byd sea lion is coming (on top of the current competition in the Zeekr 001, BYD Yuan Plus).  I think the sea lion will put a lot of pressure on the Model Y.  Then you add subsidies on EV ends in China in 2023.  So can Tesla still grow in China? Yes, but they will have to either cut prices or come out with a lower price model: both of these will affect margins. \n\nEurope:  This market will continue to grow but there are some cracks. at the end of Q4: Tesla offered some discount on their inventories  (https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-offering-discounts-up-to-e4000-on-model-3-y-purchases-from-existing-inventory-in-europe/).  Subsidies in major markets in Europe is winding down also. UK winded down: https://www.electrive.com/2022/06/14/the-british-government-has-stopped-subsidizing-electric-cars/.  UK market is important to watch because of this.  Germany is also winding down:  by 2024 vehicles above \u20ac45K\nsource: https://www.reuters.com/technology/german-coalition-parties-agree-reduce-e-car-subsidies-handelsblatt-2022-07-26/\nI don't know about France.  ,3 most populous country in the EU are Germany, UK, and France.  Then you have more competition: not just from EV but from traditional hybrids: ie prius, civic hybrid, etc. \n\nUSA:  Tesla was given a carrot here with the IRA (I am still not 100% sure how much if any Tesla buyers will get).  but many won't be able to get this due to income limits.  Saying that I think Tesla will grow by quite a bit here.  However if the following link is accurate: (https://www.atlasevhub.com/materials/the-inflation-reduction-act-ev-provisions/), the subsidies for NEW EV is only $7.5 billion: it will run out in 2 to 5 years: depending on how much each vehicle qualifies for and how much qualified EV GM, Ford, VW produce.  \n\nAt the end of the day: Tesla is a premium/luxury cars. the market for these cars is very finite.  Without subsidies, many EV are not cost competitive with hybrids.  \n\nCurrent market cap of $385 billion: this is much more palatable than $1.1 trillion or $644 billion.  But my question is still the same. $385 market cap: at 10% market return: in 7 years: market cap will be $770 billion. And future PE of 25: earnings will have to be about $30.8 billion/year or $7.7 billion/quarter.  Again this is a lot more palatable than what I wrote 2 months ago ($13 billion/quarter)."

Then there are two other big issues. \n\nFirst, increased competition from the big boy car markers, and 2nd, everything to do with FSD. There is going to be lawsuits from customers over false advertising, and all it takes is one confirmed disaster where FSD causes an accident and kills someone. I can see how it works in YouTube videos, and how its advertised, there is a big gap between the two, and I think that's a big legal liability."

Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).\r  \n\r  \nIt operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).\r  \n\r  \nIt does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai.

It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.\r  \n\r  \nDespite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate.

Invest in only your top 3 ideas\n\n90% put it all in the Vanguard total market index fund (one holding)\n\nOver time contribute every month to both funds. Of monthly contributions: 90% monthly to vanguard and 10% to companies fund. Once you\u2019ve read and gained experience and after you\u2019ve been through \n1) a big stock boom\n2) a huge crash/recession\n3) a period of extreme low volatility\nThen you adjust your 90-10 breakdown, put more in stocks. But always invest in just your top 3 ideas. Why put money in your 4th best idea?\n\nBest of luck\n\nAlso - keep in mind when you read in the news that we\u2019re \u201cofficially\u201d (not likely or maybe) but officially in a recession - as in have gone through 2 quarters of negative GDP in the past! Then you double or triple contributions monthly.

Be that 1% and do the above and you\u2019ll make a fortune in no time."

You kinda do that by holding SPY, but it is a pretty small part of your portfolio at this point.\n\nObviously you like tech, and so do I.

You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term? It does pay great dividends but for the past several years has done nothing so although a stock like that may be good for an older investor looking for a steady dividend paying stock, at 19 it\u2019s not a good thing, you don\u2019t need dividends, you need growth.

     "Are you cool leaving this untouched for at least 10 years, ideally more? If not, you might want to think about an alternative plan, but there are plenty of broad market type ETFs to invest in where you can just set it and forget it. VOO is an S&P 500 fund which represents about 85% of the US stock market and is the most popular index being tracked. That\u2019s a perfectly fine option. You could also consider VTI which represents the total US Market, but the difference in performance will likely be very small. Most investors think at least some international exposure is a good idea, especially if your time horizon isn\u2019t very very long. You have a few basic options if you wish to include some broad international exposure. One option is to combine (VOO or VTI) with VXUS which represents the total investable stock market outside the US at some percentage you feel comfortable Witt. VT is a single ETF which represents the total global stock market at the current market cap weights (which is currently around 60/40 U.S./ex-U.S.). These are some basic options. Again, if you feel you might need the money in the next 5 years or even 10, you might want to consider other options than an all stock portfolio. Good luck."

  "Text": "b' \\n\\nTSLA is going to drop more before it rises again. \\n\\nConsider all the usual problems with growth stocks: extremely high PE and forward PE, speculative future income. After so much QE, there is simply so much space for quantitative tightening coming. Yellen has recently reiterated her commitment to controlling inflation to 2% by the end of 2022. While that is optimistic, I think that this reflects the general sentiment at the Fed that something has to be done before the inflation situation deteriorates further. While some of the recent price drops come from fear, the issue with many of these growth stocks comes from contracting PE in the foreseeable 1-2 years. When rates are higher and money is less available, the big players (and hence also the small players) are simply incentivized to hold more cash. This, in turn, will cause prices to drop, and there is a vicious cycle going on here that is the reverse of the virtuous bubble cycle that brought prices so high in the first place. \\n\\nA'",

It caused him to sell on the first big jump to $640.   He makes a great case for $427 (which is why he sold on its first rocket to $640) but has rewritten his valuation so that you can add up the parts and see what you come up with yourself.\\n\\nRather than be a crazy bull or bear, give us your thoughts on these projections and where you think they are too optimistic or to pessimistic.

Even Cathie Wood isn't that bullish (or foolish) on Tesla.\n\nFor those new to investing, good news doesn't necessarily mean the stock will go up in price. A company can report great earnings, but the stock drop 5%. Yes the Democratic party is more friendly to green companies, but that doesn't mean TSLA will go up in price.\n\nIf you believe that TSLA at the current price is a good investment then buy and hold. I feel like too many people holding TSLA are trying to convince others to buy and hold because they lack the conviction to hold the investment themselves without knowing that others are doing the same. This is why they get so angry when people sell their shares.\n\nI was buying TSLA when it crashed from 280 to 190 pre-split. At that time everyone was saying how stupid of an investment TSLA was. They were saying Tesla was going bankrupt, stock was going to zero. blah, blah blah. Man how times have changed.\n\nI sold most of my shares, with just a tiny percentage left that I will hold for at least 10 years. Yes, if the stock 2x or 3x this year I will have missed out on massive gains, but meh whatever. \n\nA great stock that you overpay for can be a bad investment."

Funds that are indexed to the S&P 500 will buy Tesla in the last 15 minutes on Friday, and brokerages and market makers will sell shares that they either bought ahead of time or will borrow to these indexed funds. Any shares that are borrowed to sell to the indexed funds will need to be bought back in the following weeks, providing support for the stock. Another source of support will be funds benchmarked to the S&P 500, 90% of which have not bought any Tesla yet, and are likely waiting until after inclusion to see if they can get a good deal on Tesla shares and avoid buying into a volatile time. Ultimately they will want to buy Tesla up to equal weight sooner rather than later because otherwise they are risking their alpha.\n\nAnyway, I think people are fearful of Tesla because of the \u201cvaluation\u201d and how it ran up so far so fast. I don\u2019t think too many people realize that Tesla\u2019s P/E is about to be cut in half from just one quarter of earnings and then in half again over 2021 (forward P/E is around 250).

But he says it will definitely be a bumpy road. If you have more money to invest i would hold and buy more if it drops. If you want to sell and buy back that depends on your tax rate. I don't think if it does drop it will go to far past 600 maybe 575.

For me the price has gotten to high for my personal comfort level so I sold my last 2 shares and I feel fine about it. Here is a story of my 1 year ride on the Tesla coaster. \\n\\nMy first purchase was 5 shares back in June of 2019 @ a price of $220 a share. I work in the solar industry and was seeing how many power walls my company was installing to pair with solar projects. I also was noticing more and more Tesla's on the road and this is what swayed my decision to jump into what at the time was considered a bad stock. By July the stock was up to $260 and I was feeling great about my investment. Earning were just around the corner so I decided to hold and see what happens. It did not go well. The stock dropped right back to my purchase price and even dipped below a few times. I stuck with it because I believed in the company and my position never got to -10% which is a rule I try to follow and cut loses\"",

I feel like his focus is shifting. \\n\\nWVAGY is taking off, Im not sure if it is a good replacement for TSLA or not. But it feels like it is  serious . Im looking long terms like 1-2 years investment. Is this german company going to take over the TSLA?

Manufacturing is difficult to scale, and it doesn't get easier as you get bigger. And the Musk temper-tantrums with California don't help, because scaling requires good relationships with state governments. And it may turn out that other carmakers are already so invested in the South that the Tesla won't find a favorable environment there just by being anti-California; his competitors might actually prefer to see him stumble, and they've already invested in the local politics.\n\nMeanwhile, VW can just convert existing plants all over the world, retrain existing workers, etc. It is questionable if Tesla was ever even noticeable competition for VW.\ud83d\udc7c"

Tulip bulb mania, roaring 20's, 1999 internet bubble, 2007 housing bubble, all this shit had the same run up before it tanked. \n\nTo get long TSLA, I would like to see what happens in a real bear market or deep correction. If TSLA reaches a low point and bottoms out before the indices, I think it's a solid buy. AAPL AMZN did the same thing during 2008 and it led to a full decade of solid returns. \n\nRight now, there are too many dreamers and likely bagholders praying TSLA will go back up. But I don't think there is enough margin and speculative fervor to do it. Not after the ramp it had and not in a world where the 10 year is widely expected to shoot up to 2.25%."

GM, Ford, BMW, Toyota, Chinese companies (like NIO), Tata Motors. There are many other car manufacturers, all of them investing in hybrids or EVs.\n\n\"  looking at the TSLA stock performance during the last 3 months I feel like people are disappointed in TSLA\" I am sorry, but how can I take you seriously after this?\n\nTesla had an insane rally in 2020, so now we have a healthy and long-time anticipated correction. Disappointed are guys, who lack fundamentals or fresh investors seeking instant gains in a bearish market. Imo a great buy, but maybe not yet.\n\nVW is like the \"Buy the Rumour, Sell the News\" stock now. It will have its momentum for some time, but who knows how it will behave. It's a solid company, so you should make a profit in the long-term eventually.\n\nPersonally, I just swing trade some NIO shares, because I like the company and their cars. Plus, some fractional shares of Tesla @$600 to avg down every >10% drop. I am cautious bout automotive industry, so it's <10% of my portfolio."

     "There are a few reasons for that: sentiment. Tesla is a very controversial and volatile stock. It is used heavily for trading and people easily FOMO in when sentiment is good or sell, when it is bad. Gains make it a fun and \"cool\" investment, while losses make Elon Musk a horrible CEO. Regardless of if those statements are true or not.\n\nAdditionally it depends heavily on interest rates. Most cash flows to shareholders are expected to come in the future, so changes in interest rates change the present value of those drastically. Distant earnings are uncertain and predictions on how high they will be can change daily, depending on small pieces of information (market share, current sales, brand loyalty, successes/failures in their investments/research/production/autonomous driving...).\n\nOverall a very risky and volatile investment and at least i am not comfortable to say to any degree of certainty what the future cash flows will be and which price might be appropriate for them."

Speculators were literally lining up to give anyone with an Internet idea their money, the sector was full of junk companies.  \n\nNow you have companies like MSFT, AMZN, etc that are incredibly solid companies that will rise and fall with the markets and independently based on their own performance... but the likelihood that one day everyone is like this 'Internet/Computer' thing is going nowhere and just pull their money out of the sector is very unlikely. \n\nBut adding an ETF that isn't tech heavy as part of a balanced portfolio is a good idea...

     "**Most important piece of advice anyone can give you:** ignore everyone who says you should buy company X. Certain ETFs, like VOO, are very low risk if you just dollar cost average over time, but every single company is risky unless you have a very good understanding of the business, products, leadership, financials, etc. You could buy the best stock in the world and still lose money on it because you didn't understand it and bought and/or sold it at a bad time.\n\nThat said, it doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in single stocks. We as retail investors have a huge advantage over institutions and money managers because we don't lose clients or targets if we underperform the market in the short term. For example, being 100% TSLA would've been a disaster for any money manager a whole bunch of times in the last 4 years, while as a retail investor you could've just held through it all and be up 10x vs the S&P's 1.5x. Besides, owning single stocks is a lot more fun than owning an index fund, which also motivates you to not spend your money on shit you don't need and invest even more.\n\nThe only downside is that it requires a lot of work, and it will take a few years before you're knowledgeable enough to analyse companies well enough to determine which ones are worth holding long term. You will unquestionably lose money on some (or all) of them along the way, but if you enjoy it and you're willing to do the work, it'll be a huge positive in your life in the long run. And you're still very young, so you got plenty of time to learn!"

     "As most have said - the safest pick is VOO. Just own the entire S&P 500 instead of trying to beat it. That said, a good way to think of rank ordering risk might be;\n\n1) VOO, it\u2019s the S&P 500.\n2) VGT/SPYG/QQQ/Similar. Broad based but more tech focused than VOO. Maybe slightly more risk but more upside too.\n3) Sector based ETFs like XLF for financials or XLI for industrials. If you like a sector you can invest in one of these funds to get broad exposure vs. picking 1 or 2 individual stocks.\n4) Individual stocks. The most upside but also the most downside. Any one stock can go bankrupt, even when you think it can\u2019t (Enron). Buy and reassess, don\u2019t buy and hold. You need to always ask the question if you had 100% cash today would you own the same holdings? If no, sell and reallocate.\n\nI\u2019d suggest mostly investing in 1-3 above until you feel comfortable enough analyzing individual companies (maybe you already do) then venturing into 4. Just make sure you never get too heavy in one individual holding and please avoid trashy, scammy \u201cmeme\u201d stocks like the plague.\n\nCongrats on getting started early. My dad got me going with a Roth IRA at the same age as you and it\u2019s true you will be a millionaire by 40 if you keep adding cash and invest wisely (don\u2019t gamble).\n\nGood luck!"

By investing in a diverse range of stocks, you're much more likely to be holding something that becomes part of the fabric of everything, rather than a big portion of crap.\r  \n\r  \nIf you're interested in learning more about this kind of investment approach, I highly recommend checking out this book I'm reading called \"The Psychology of Money\". One chapter that really stood out to me tells the story of a legendary art collector who made a fortune by buying lots and lots of art, including works by the likes of Picasso and Pollock.\n\n\rLink to book here: [https://amzn.to/3DITcRO](https://amzn.to/3DITcRO)\n\n\r  \nAt the end of his life, he sold his collection to the German government for $100m - a price that was seen as an incredible deal. People looked at the collection and wondered how one man could have possibly known 60 years ago that some of these artists would become enormous names. \n\nThe truth is, his tactic was simple: he bought lots and lots of art and just waited to see which pieces would be the biggest.\r  \n\r  \nThe same idea applies to stocks. Even if most of the stocks you buy don't perform that well, if just a few takeoffs, you'll be in a great position. \n\nAnd that's the beauty of the stock market - it's not just about capitalism, it's about how the world, and how nature works. We are the result of a long change of nature trying 1000 different things and then just running with whatever works best."

But if you are still afraid,  there's going to be a stock buy back soon.  You can wait and sell around that time.  Otherwise I advise you to stick to the reason you chose Tesla.  Everyone here is giving you their own opinions about Tesla but the question really is what do you think?  In stocks trading opinions varies and the fact that majority are saying a different thing doesn't mean you are wrong.  Mind you,  90% of stock traders lose money.  Stick to your analysis and believe in your trade. My only advice is to have a stop loss. The price at which you get out of the trade."

Is it absolutely a cop out and shit, but it is what it is...buy side analysts on the other hand, have no conflict of interest as their mandate is to generate the best investment ideas without bias, unfortunately you'll never get buy side research as its the edge for funds. \n\nThey know exactly what they are doing and playing the game."

So why are you entitled to the same benefits as the buysiders who are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to see research? \n\nThe sell side is about much more than just picking stocks and it's physically impossible to be good at everything because good analysts work 60-80 hour weeks (more during earnings) just to be good at a handful of those tasks. \n\nOf course analysts can be bad at picking stocks. You know why? Because picking stocks is hard, which is why the good stock pickers get paid so much.

     "Tesla have made the $35,000 Model 3 as soon as possible.\n\nThe market, overall, has completely mis-read the recent price drops across their vehicles. The market thinks demand is slowing and Tesla is cutting prices to increase demand.\n\nIn fact, the cost per kWh of their batteries is decreasing along an exponential cost curve, and economies of scale are coming in to play. Tesla is passing on these savings as soon as they can. The battery cost is going to CONTINUE to fall, indefinitely. This means margins will continue to climb and Tesla will continue to have the option of lowering costs (the battery is by far the largest cost item in their vehicles).\n\nMoving to an online-only sale model is a masterstroke. The market has misread this as desperation, but Tesla have done it to assist in lowering prices.\n\nThis is the tightest Tesla will be financially for their forseeable future. Q1 2019 will probably be the last month Tesla does not show a profit, period.\n\nHardly a single analyst, except for ARK's Catherine Woods understands the big play here:\n\nTesla's fleet of cars is going to become part of an autonomous, on-demand transport network like Lift/Uber. Owners will be able to add their cars to the fleet when not in use and Tesla will take a clip of all rides, AND Tesla can also produce it's own vehicles to add directly to the fleet. \n\nTHE MORE TESLAS ON THE ROAD, THE MORE THEIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN AI SELF DRIVING PULLS FURTHER AHEAD. \n\nNo one else has CLOSE to the amount of miles driven. If memory serves, Tesla has more than 30x as many miles of data than anyone else.\n\nEstimates put them about 3 years ahead of the competition in self driving AI... and their new. GPU is 2000% better than the NVIDIA chip they were using.."

     "Personally, I like what Tesla is about and the change the company is pushing broader society to adopt, like embracing electric automobiles for the masses--in my opinion, it's a noble pursuit and a fun company to watch from the sidelines. But why from the sidelines? From an investment standpoint, the fundamentals just aren't there. Tesla struggles with profitability, operates on slim margins, has high levels of debt, more speculative and hopeful investors than rational ones, and generates a negative return on assets, equity, and invested capital, for starters. Not to mention that competition is catching up; competitors with a much stronger balance sheets, resources, and experience are producing fully-electric vehicles with comparable quality. Management at Tesla has been a merry-go-round with a host of key executives contributing to the high turnover rate of employment in important positions, which is not good from a strategic standpoint. Operationally, they've historically been struggling with meeting manufacturing output, and they're notoriously difficult with processing customer returns, which is another sign that the company is still in the very early stages of its life cycle. In sum, I like what Tesla is about and want to see them succeed--but its stock just carries way too much risk and not enough sense in order to warrant my investment. There are so many better picks an investor can make over Tesla, and it doesn't necessarily mean they dislike the company--myself included."

     "Since SA articles are blacklisted, here's the plaintext from one that explains it really well. I've got no affiliation w/ this author, just thought it was a well written article and I tried to post it but the post was automatically removed. Yay censorship! Anyway, good explanation of exactly why TSLA took a dump after their \"positive\" news:\n\n------------------------------\n\nSummary\nTesla hosted a very secret conference call in conjunction with its Thursday announcement about $35,000 Model 3 and closing most of its stores.\n\nA transcript of this secret call has found its way into the public domain. I provide links to it. You were not supposed to read or hear this.\n\nTesla gave new profit and loss guidance, as well as contradicted its written $35,000 Model 3 delivery estimate - June instead of 2-4 weeks from now.\n\nAsked about the $35,000 Model 3 profit margin, CEO Elon Musk said \u201cwe\u2019re not going to answer questions like that.\u201d.\n\nHowever, the report from the Deutsche Bank report merely hours thereafter says that Tesla provided precisely this guidance to them privately.\n\nLooking for more? I update all of my investing ideas and strategies to members of Auto Insight For Wall St.. Start your free trial today \u00bb\n\nLast Thursday afternoon, news started coming across the tape about a company that was closing almost all of its stores, laying off employees, and cutting prices dramatically in what seems like a fire sale. Sears, I wondered?\n\nNot quite. It was that $50 billion market cap company, Tesla (TSLA): $35,000 Tesla Model 3 Available Now.\n\nIn order to elaborate on the matter further, Tesla organized a secret conference call to which only a few of its most loyal fans were invited. You might have thought that Tesla being in recent hot water with the SEC would have meant that Tesla should have avoided keeping the dissemination of most important new guidance to a small selected group, but no. Quoth The Raven commented as follows: Quoth the Raven on Twitter\n\n\u201cBy the way is $TSLA hosting a secret conference call where they\u2019re doling out material guidance and ducking questions on margin? And if so, sans an 8-K, how does that not violate securities laws?\u201d\n\n-- Quoth The Raven, aka Chris Irons\n\nHowever, the attempt to keep this conference call\u2019s full contents shielded from the investing public did not succeed any better than former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn\u2019s telephone call with the Russian Ambassador in January 2017. Within approximately 24 hours, Paul Huettner had transcribed an audio recording of the secret conference call:\n\nPaul Huettner, CFA on Twitter\n\nIf you prefer a Google Drive link to Paul Huettner\u2019s transcript of Tesla\u2019s secret conference call, here it is:\n\nTesla Call Transcript (2.28.19).pdf\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for The Los Angeles Times to point out one of the glaring inconsistencies in this selective disclosure from Tesla and its CEO: Tesla website and Elon Musk differ on Model 3 delivery dates. Two weeks? Four months?\n\nBasically, the Tesla web site says that you can get a $36,200 (including delivery charge) Model 3 in 2-4 weeks, but Musk said on the call that it\u2019s June - which is clearly not 2-4 weeks from now. LA Times sought clarification from Tesla on this matter, and the company said that Musk\u2019s word on the secret conference call was the accurate timeline.\n\nThis is beyond asinine. What Tesla is saying is that its 2-4 week estimated delivery time - which you can see by simply going to Tesla\u2019s web site and click to configure a Model 3 - is apparently false information. The correct information? Only provided on a secret conference call to a tiny number of Tesla\u2019s closest fans. That\u2019s what Tesla admitted to The LA Times.\n\nWhy would Tesla do this? I have absolutely no idea, but one suspects that Tesla wants people who visit its web site to be tempted to hand over $2,500 while believing that they will get a car in 2-4 weeks. Then, on the conference call, Musk forgot about that bait-and-switch and told what he knew to be the truth - that June is the correct estimate.\n\nJust think about it: How on Earth do you get a custom-made car built and delivered in 2-4 weeks? Assuming nobody is ahead of you in line, 2-4 weeks can be a typical all-in delivery time across the country. Surely Tesla isn\u2019t suggesting that demand is so low that there's almost nobody else ordering this new $36,200 vehicle?\n\nThen there\u2019s that other thing\u2026\n\nOne of the questions near the end of the secret conference call was this: \u201cWhat is that Tesla\u2019s profit margin on each and every $35,000 Model 3 sold?\u201d Musk responded: \u201cYeah. We\u2019re not going to answer questions like that. Next question.\u201d\n\nOK, so Tesla doesn\u2019t want to get into the subject of the $35,000 (plus $1,200 delivery charge) Model 3 margin, in speaking to a group - even on a secret conference call.\n\nHowever, the following day - March 1 - Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner published a report for DB\u2019s clients called \u201cSR M3 Likely Addresses Issues; Questions Now Back To Margin.\u201d In this report, DB writes as follows:\n\n\u201cIn our follow-ups with the company, management outlined a high level bridge to maintaining profitability which includes savings from higher fixed cost absorption\u2026Tesla indicated that initially, the $35k Model 3 will generate a positive cash gross margin (gross profit plus depreciation of approximately $1,500)\u2026.\u201d\n\nWait a minute! Why is Tesla providing this information selectively to Deutsche Bank? Hours before this report was published, on the secret conference call, CEO Musk said that he is not going to answer questions like that. However, apparently in an even more secret private dialogue between Tesla and Deutsche Bank, Tesla provides this highly important information in the most selective manner possible.\n\nDid any of Deutsche Bank\u2019s competitors get this information too? Did Goldman Sachs? Did Morgan Stanley? I have no idea. One thing is clear: The investing public never got to hear this information, and in this case even the secret conference call participants were told that Tesla is \u201cnot going to answer questions like that.\u201d\n\n...Except in private dialogue with Deutsche Bank, apparently.\n\nBottom line: Where is the SEC on all of this?\n\nWe are barely scraping the surface here, but immediately we find three things:\n\nOn a secret conference call with outsiders, Tesla provides new profit and loss guidance.\n\nOn the same secret conference call, Tesla massively contradicts its new Model 3 delivery times - four months instead of 2-4 weeks - and then confirms that what was said on the secret call is the accurate information. Still, as of this writing, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 order site reflects the information Tesla told LA Times is incorrect.\n\nIn a private dialogue with Deutsche Bank, Tesla provides gross margin guidance for the $35,000 Model 3 specifically, immediately after having said on the conference call that it was \u201cnot going to answer questions like that.\u201d\n\nThe only conclusion that most investors, who are not part of these privileged management conversations, can say for certain is: Tesla is the boss in the relationship with the SEC, tossing around a submissive SEC staff like a dog owner with a tiny pup on a leash."

     "It's a good time to buy TSLA ( I am buying more).  The news is full of FUD to drive the price down.  The stores closing is just streamlining and cutting costs so they can sell their cars as cheap as possible.  All of their sales have gone through the website ordering system, even if you went into the store.  So the stores were not really necessary.  The China Gigafactory will be producing cars in a few months and volume production is expected by the end of this year.  The Model Y targets the biggest auto segment in north america.  They just acquired Maxwell Technologies; their dry cell chemistry offers a 15% to 50% improvement in energy density over current Lion batteries.   Also Tesla keeps cranking out grid scale batteries and the solar roof is on the way (still testing long term durability, targeting 50yr lifetime) . "

     "It's simple. The stock was overvalued and the market is correcting itself to more accurately reflect the offering TSLA brings to consumers and, more specifically, investors. \n\nTSLA is not a stock of reason, as it is priced emotionally. Some people will hear they're closing stores and they'll want out, not knowing that most of their sales are done online, and Tesla's cars are a different field than ICE vehicles all together. Primarily, they don't appeal to everyone, as not everyone's commute can handle the limited range or charging requirements. So why have a bunch of stores for people to test drive and compare your vehicle when the vast majority of consumers are not your target market? If someone wants a Tesla, they'll find a way to test drive from Tesla. \n\n People want to believe in electric vehicles, because they believe electric vehicles are the future. They want to believe in AI for the same reason. I imagine most people who are heavy in TSLA do not believe it is a short term hold. "

If my memory serves me correctly, they've mentioned that they will not turn a profit this quarter, which is concerning - if they aren't profiting now, when will they ever? How much longer before they finally \"optimize\" their manufacturing process?\n\nStores closing is a huge red flag for me tbh - definitely not a sign of growth. It seems like in the past a lot of passive buyers were converted after a demo/test drive. Sure Tesla will save money in rent, but I feel like in the long term this will weaken the brand strength. Less casual test drivers = less buzz. Less storefronts = less presence. Sure you might still be able to test drive a Tesla where they bring one to your door, but only motivated buyers already considering Tesla as their next car would probably go through the trouble.\n\nLastly, cutting the price of the Model 3 I feel like alienated their most recent buyers. Imagine if you had just bought the car two months ago how angry you'd be that the value of your car dropped $10-20k in that measly amount of time. And new buyers would probably be hesitant to buy, wondering whether there is going to be another sudden price cut\n\nJust my two cents. I'm a Tesla fan and love the cars, but the future doesn't look too bright imo. Change my mind!"

  "Text": "b\"I've read a CNBC article some weeks ago which claimed that all the S&P 500 index funds will ultimately buy about 70bn of TSLA stock in the premarket hour tomorrow and they would have to do it at the closing price of friday, which is 695 USD.\\n\\nDuring the after market hours, we've all seen the very violent upward and downward moves of TSLA, none have surpassed 695 USD. Is that maybe a sign that the major funds have already bought into TSLA during the friday after hours or will the real buying still happen this monday premarket?\"",

     "Index funds all buy at close because they want zero tracking error. Benchmark funds can buy whenever and if TSLA dips next week relative to the S&P they would likely buy since that is free alpha to beat the market."
