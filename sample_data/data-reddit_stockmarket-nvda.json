First of all TA requires candles, because the wicks and bodies are just as important.\n\nThis is what you're looking at on the monthly: Also your \"monthly\" is just the last month. You're looking at daily price still.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/)\n\nOn the daily this is called a tower.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/)\n\nIt could signal reversal, but it could just be a pause and more upward.\n\nTech Analysis is more about target price and risk management than about predicting direction. How much risk does it have to do the opposite of what you think, and how much reward could be expected if it does what you think.\n\nBulkowski's patterns are very good for their target pricing. Most patterns are 50/50 on which direction they go, and they have 4 ways of getting there.\n\n1. Go your way\n2. Go against you.\n3. Go your way but then bust and reverse direction\n4. Go against you then bust and go your way.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/)\n\nThis gap is a significant problem for bulls, gaps are usually filled. Traders know this. So they won't be buying. Only stooges buy something that gaps like this which is why the stock stalled. Retail is buying, traders are out, institutions likely aren't involved.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/)\n\nOn a 4 hour this is a triple bottom. I am short AAPL for similar reasons. NVDA was more irrational because of the gap so I played AAPL instead.\n\nNVDA will likely fail the triple bottom and fill the gap. That's the trade I'd play if I weren't already playing it in AAPL and I'm also short SPY.\n\nI'm also long TLT and GLD so there's a bit of \"counter trend\" in my portfolio already so no need to go for NVDA."

Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.\\n\\n1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.\\n2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.\\n3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair \"",

She doesn't have time for that-she is the Speaker of the House. Way too busy for stocks. Paul Pelosi has a hedge fund since before most wall street bets guys were going peepee in pampers- Paul's best trade lately was Roblox - a video game thingy.  That's certainly can't even remotely be related to Congress.  \n\nThis Nvidia trade was -I thought it was- a call options exercise from over a year long trade by the looks of it.

Does he even beat the SPY index? \n\nJoe Biden has never owned a stock in his entire career and he's from the state with the most Fortune 500 companies. Delaware has more corporations than people.

We don't give enough support to make anything happen in the United States Senate. That's the millstone hanging from everyone's neck. \n\nThe only politicians in Congress who don't take money from corporations and corporate donors is AOC and several progressive politicians like AOC. \n\nSenator Sheldon Whitehouse.

In a bear market, when prices are declining then having a negative delta position is statistically favorable, so that\u2019s why I have that position, so to go in the opposite direction is what\u2019s bad.\n\nI was praying for Jerome Powell to come out and announce an emergency 1,000 bps hike in the fed funds rate.

Many ppl who use NVDA product they like it and buy this stock.\nYes it is truly $10T in next 5 to 10 years\u2026IMO.\nNVDA won\u2019t manufacture chips. They design high end GPUs and AI chips and give manufacturing order to TSM and Samsung. This is grate advantage on quick design change and adopt to new architecture design. This is one reason their chips are high cost. (What I remember is, they have one graphic card which price more than $30k . Still it has demand and customer are buying)\nNVDA has pricing power in the market like Apple. No other chip maker has that power.\nNVDA means speed."

However I have one thing that worries me and that is that companies are designing their own processors. Apple made their M1 chip and on the server side Amazon and Google are design and implementing their own chips specifically made for servers. For example, AWS is going to offer server space that utilizes AWS chips or NVDA chips that can use CUDA processing. In that case it's up to the customer to decide. For ongoing projects it's not easy to switch but new projects from startups could be made on processing power from a different working environment. That being said what do other people think of this. The server side has a nice profit margin, it would be a shame for both companies if they might lose future market share."

They know how to read financial statements and ask questions that allow them to fill in cell B13 on their Excel models - but often the questions they ask suggest they're focusing in the \"wrong\" area, while the answers they're given are so lacking in specificity that even if the question was spot-on, it doesn't inform an insightful answer.  \n\nDo your own research.  And if you're not willing to go deep on any one company, go broad on many - index funds or mutual funds to spread risk.   And if you do invest in singular companies/stocks just be prepared for the inevitable highs and lows that follow as you try to outsmart the market.  \n\nCramer was also hot on Theranos and we all know how that ended.

A CPU can do it faster because it's simply not doing that much. For AI art and movie creation, that's a different story. It lends itself very well to processing on GPUs, but how big a market share is that really? Any individual idiot can already download Automatic1111 and make AI art all day on his video card at home. Really no need to ugprade. Movie studios will want to use a bunch for this, but that's what, maybe 10,000 cards for every movie studio that needs AI art on the planet. Most of them will farm it out to the cloud where GPU's will be shared by multiple projects.

Most homes, cars, appliances, and whatever else you can think of, are not online. Approximately 35% of the planet is still not fully online in the way that we think of being online in the developed world. What will enable a fully connected world? For the foreseeable future it is silicon chips. They will enable functionality and intelligence in everything. Betting on chip designers and manufacturers over the long term will be a safe investment. Short term fluctuations are inevitable as are the long term gains in this sector. Something else worth mentioning is the quality of NVDA as a company. They hire the absolute best and have a culture that supports them. Try plucking an NVDA employee to go and work for another company, they will tell you thanks but no thanks. This company is like no other."

We will see another quarter of declining YOY revenue growth. The next quarter will also likely have improving margins.

     "Right path bro. I think this is a good time to buy stocks amidst the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe formation of a new ecosystem will take time. In this scenario, some years will be required before a robust economy emerges. However, the market is most likely oversold globally right now. Oil adjusted for inflation is back to levels not seen since the height of Iran-Iraq war in 1986\u201387. That world though not known by most traders, is worth revisiting, the savings from low cost energy does help the economy recover in a meaningful way.\n\nBeen trying to shift my attention in several market like crypto too since I have been seeing companies that holds a lot of potential like BTCS. Anyway, this will bring back a level of prosperity to more people than the last three recoveries. The idea of a jobless recovery will not not be the case this time. If an investor has a window period of longer than than months or even a few years, than there is nothing wrong in investing now. But, if the goals are short term, it may well be better to wait until stability returns. \n\nRecoveries often witness a traders market before stability comes once more. What is certain is that the world is not ending, and a mysterious illnesses will pass. The likely results will be fortunes which are lost and others which will be made."

Let\u2019s face it, no one cares about a POSSIBLE recession, or higher interest rates unless you are building new homes, or can\u2019t pay your rent. There\u2019s 96.6 percent of people walking around with money in their pockets, good jobs, health insurance, and wanting a vacation.  The retired are happy with their large raise in SS in January.  Food prices and building new homes have come down considerably from those detrimental high prices. \n   The headlines are not bad; those who talk about a recession and  everyone looks around and says, \u201cWhat recession?\u201d and go out to dinner or go enjoy their lives while the Fed wrings it\u2019s hands and the markets go up because after all, \u201cWhat recession.\u201d  No one will change their attitudes and stop or slow their spending until they have the pain. How do Americans get the pain?  Layoffs, plenty of layoffs so lots of Americans feel the pinch. It\u2019s not a problem if you can get another job right away. You may have to change your lifestyle but  as long as you got \u201crent money\u201d you are fine. \n     So the truth is, will the Fed cause the pain? They want unemployment at 4.6 percent ( and maybe interest rates at 6%? ) and aren\u2019t getting their way. As long as people don\u2019t feel the pain everything IS FINE."

They have a tonne of orders in for their product and they are way ahead of the competition in a massively growing field.\n\nIve seen big funds calulating that at future earnings in 5 years time their current P/E is 1.5. So if the P/E held they would make a lot of money on NVDA at the se prices.\n\nAdd to this NVDA is decoupled from the company ita a bet on AI at this point. Just like BTC and block chain. BTC didnt do anything that wasnt done better by something else. But it was the embodiment of investing in block chain technology.\n\nIn saying all that I am not buying NVDA at the current price."

     "\"NVDA is overvalued, you should buy value stocks\" isn't a good argument. Mostly because cheap stocks in relations to assets and earnings are in businesses where returns on capital are low, and it requires selling them for new cheap stocks once they've appreciated. It can be done, but I'd much rather be part of a business with good economics that can be held for a longer period of time. \n\nFun fact - the S&P growth and value index have very similar revenue growth rates. Growth has outperformed for a decade because it has vastly higher returns on capital. They are better businesses because they require less investment to grow, even if the growth is slow."

In case of abundant cheap money fundamentals don't matter, only speculation, hype and moonshots. I think the market is still in this mindset, and either 1) there will be a rude awakening and realisation that money is no longer that cheap, and reality still matters (if Fed follows through with what they say) or 2) We're back to money printing, hype bonanza, and even more inequality"

     "I sold numerous times over the last several years. I stopped messing with it once it got over $300. Though I regret it, I still think the stock is an inflated bubble.\n\nI have no clue how some people get some of these projections. NVDA needs serious growth to reach the value that people are anticipating, which it is doing. Though, I don't know how long it can continue it's projected growth. By investing in NVDA, you are investing in the fact that they stay at the forefront of developing chips for gaming, AI, cloud computing, and crypto mining - and that such markets continue to grow significantly.\n\nNVDAs dividends are at a minor 0.10% yield right now. All investors are investing in is the hope of selling it at a higher price in the future, or one day they start paying serious dividends. Paying a decent dividend would require their earnings to significantly grow. The P/E ratio is insane. For significant growth, the P/E ratio either needs to continue climbing to insane heights from all the optimism, or the company somehow expand their market presence, which is hard considering they are at the forefront of it.\n\nI love NVDA, it was my first investment, bought at $53 per share. I've missed out on some serious financial gain because I've sold it a few years back. It has been one of the fastest growing stocks for a while now. Though, that growth seems to be mostly in it's P/E ratio. Whether you hold/buy/sell is up to you, just know that there is a lot of optimism riding it's current price.\n\nCurrently, there are better soltions to crypto currency mining than GPUs, but the price for the alternative solutions are much higher. If competition prices were to drop, NVDA could face some losses. GPU prices have also significantly increased, and many are on back order. I'm curious if GPU prices will drop soon, and if new chip manufacturers will rise up to compete with NVDA because of all the silicone chip growth."

By your logic, I can just say that the GDP of Somalia (7,293 billion) is higher than that of more than 5 countries combined (Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands). While this argument is true, it fails to take into consideration the difference in size of these countries and purposefully neglects other countries who have a similar GDP to Somalia, thus presenting a distorted image that overinflates the image of Somalia."

You have provided great exit liquidity for those of us who bought last year and are now selling for 100% + gains. Thank you for your service. \\n\\nConsidering the market has been propped up by five mega cap stocks and a singular sector (semiconductors) due to AI mania, Ill be protecting capital over the summer while the regards in Washington force a default due to their own incompetence.

I drove around and waited at for the car ahead of me to get its change (that took a LONG time). Most people kept leaving the line to give up on it, but I got to the window and ordered. Except that I didn't ... \"we don't have egg biscuits\" is what I was told. What he meant was that there wasn't a button for that, or that he couldn't find one - so he was just going to charge me for bacon egg and cheese biscuits and then throw away the bacon and cheese, but of course charge me $13.XX for the privilege. He even checked with the manager, and that was the best they could come up with for one of the most common items they sell.\r  \n\r  \nSo I left, and made it to another McD's before breakfast ended. This time I walked in. I was NOT ready for what I walked in to, though. Eight of the most unhappy people - who had already ordered - were waiting for their food. Then I looked around me; the tables that had people in them ALSO had no food.\r  \n\r  \nThe service and quality of McD's has dropped off like a rock into a lake. I wasted 45 minutes across two McD's and ended up with no food to show for it.\r  \n\r  \nMcD's has to be losing clients left and right. Nobody in their right mind would wait 20 minutes for McD's food AFTER having had to wait 10 minutes, or more, to order it.\r  \n\r  \nMcD's old promise of \"If you don't get your order in five minutes or less, your order is free\" promise is gone."

     "My only concern is that you do not really break down the main technological offerings of either Intel or AMD. This may be something that you assume we know and just leave it out for simplicity sake, but a technology company needs to be analyzed by its technology.\n\nInvestors made a similar mistake to the one listed above over the last five years in Intel. Investors rely solely on the financials and ignore the underlying technologies of the business. Some things that should be considered are:\n\n1. TSMC is generations ahead of Intel in manufacturing processes\n2. Intel's main direct competitors use TSMC\n3. Intel and AMD utilize x86 chip architecture which is at a disadvantage in lower power devices such as laptops when compared to x64 ARM chips\n4. Intel's offerings are technologically inferior to AMD and Nvidia's offerings in datacenters\n5. IDM 2.0 is a massive financial risk for Intel and is utilizing billions in capital investment a year\n\nI think there is much more qualitative research that would need to be conducted to definitively make a conclusion on these businesses"

     "These are both risky because they have a lot of expectations built in. For example, the price rise that NVDA got out of the ARM acquisition announcement presumes that they intend to behave in a monopolistic way, and can squeeze that market without vendors switching to RISC-V. And that the won't receive any significant regulatory response. Otherwise, the acquisition price makes no financial sense at all, it is just tossing money out the window. \n\nINTC has similar problems. People are bullish because they're building a fab. When they tried to contract out use of their existing fabs in the past, they did very poorly at it; they were greedy, they were unwilling to offer competitive prices. And when people wouldn't pay a premium just to have the honor of being their customer, they discontinued the service instead of lowering prices. And they made a lot of excuses about what had happened.\n\nBasically none of that is going to find its way into either technical or fundamental analysis. That is why I don't touch either of these stocks, and I prefer companies like AMD, AMAT, and even IBM. (What I like about IBM is that the bear case has been very popular, everybody can say something bad about them, and yet they're doing a great job of integrating their AI tools with the cloud and providing quality APIs to developers; and they're doing that while maintaining high margins and large revenue)"

Demand for chips is continuing to outstrip supply and the car industry is longer the only one feeling the pain.

Theres a few KEY points that come to mind:\\n\\n* Most chips are produced overseas: Covid-related delays in shipping ports have effected supply coming into the United States.\\n* China has been stock-piling chips: Chinese businesses have bought an absurd amount of chip-producing equipment (roughly $32 billion) in an effort to protect themselves from further US sanctions.\\n* Demand for electronic products have soared.\\n* Often over-looked, consumers dont realize the amount of chips it takes to buil'",

As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, lets use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the companys average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\\n\\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companys shares.\\n\\nSo we have nvidias equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billio'",

     "How innovative have each of these companies been over the past few years? Intel, comfortable with its dominating market share, was stagnant essentially making minor upgrades to their product lines each cycle.

NVDA was similar to Intel in that it\u2019s 20 series GPUs was a minor upgrade from the 10 series. NVDA saw what AMD did to Intel, knew AMD was designing a new GPU, so they responded with huge upgrades in the 30 series. \n\nIntel has provided their innovation roadmap showing it\u2019ll be back to making competitive products in 2022. AMD will continue to innovate with its chip architecture; it hasn\u2019t competed with NVDA in terms of GPU value performance, but it has come pretty close. AMD\u2019s next GPU line could go toe-to-toe with NVDA\u2019s next line.\n\ntl;dr, AMD has been a catalyst for innovation by becoming a real competitor against NVDA and Intel.

However, AMD has been starting to close the gap, but they still don't have a product that can compete with Nvidia in the high end.\n\nWith that said, AMD has been destroying the CPU segment, which is what saved the company. I can only imagine them growing even more in that department.\n\nAlso, Intel is starting to jump into the GPU market, so Nvidia will have another competitor. \n\nWith AMD leading the CPU segment, and another competitor entering the GPU arena, I see more upside for AMD business-wise.\n\nNow if you're talking about the stock, even if AMD might have a better chance for better growth as a business, you could argue that that growth is already priced in the stock (which is what I believe). Intel is the one with the lowest PE ratio, and frankly the only one with a dividend (I don't count Nvidia's low yield lol), but again growth is much more important than dividend in that segment of the market. AMD is the one with the highest PE ratio, and Nvidia is in the middle.\n\nIf I had to bet on one of them for the next 5 years, I'll put my money on Intel because they are the one with the lowest PE ratio by far, plus they are entering in the GPU area, plus they have the cash to catch back to AMD. AMD has great growth, but also high risk (if Lisa Su leaves it's probably gg), and it's highly valued currently."

This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.\\n2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves.

     "I know I am coming from an uncommon niche position, but I am personally boycotting Nvidia until they make an effort to improve their Linux support.  I'll admit, their GPUs are top notch. However, the support is terrible; you either have to use reverse engineered drivers that are horrible, or use proprietary firmware blobs that are out of date and under-maintained.  This is not the case for AMD GPUs, where the open source drivers are known to work at least as well as the proprietary drivers. This is because AMD actively develops open source drivers with the community to allow for better support.\n\nAgain, this is a niche position, but I know I am not alone.  If I see a laptop I am interested and see it has an nVidia GPU, I immediately turn away.  I feel really bad for people who want to use Linux but cannot because of the needless stumbling block that comes with getting the nVidia GPUs to work.  All the while, the screen constantly tears or will not display graphics whatsoever.  This is such a disheartening experience.\n\nI just bring this up to you guys as a fellow investor enthusiast.

So instead of converting, switching, and converting back.   Google instead keep it optical and have mirrors that are physically moved to change connections.\n\nIt does need to be longer life connections as it takes almost a second to realign each time to switch the connection paths.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal.   Ultimately there is a cost to run large language models like Bard and ChatGPT, etc.     The cost is over 100x of using a traditional search engine that at the core uses Backrub/Page Rank.   \n\nThis paper is really dated but so much more true today than ever before.  Google was really smart to start preparing for today 8 years ago with the development of the TPUs.  I think this is a place Microsoft has really made a mistake in not doing the same and dependent on Nvidia.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/\n\nI do love that Google shares this stuff.

But I guess they find it is worth it because it helps them attract the best talent.    Top talent want to share things.  I think this is a big reason Apple does so poorly when it comes to AI."

I heard guys telling folks to split 50/25/25 on sector etfs, NVDA, AND this week. That's a really scary sign considering we haven't seen tech respond to much sector wide negative news yet, such as if Intel's 10nm process isn't a possibility, or if AMD EPYC chips don't actually do anything, or if Nvidia just *doesn't have* a lineup for after the 10xx series. I'm not saying there aren't other good manufacturers, and I'm not saying that we should all drink the Jonestown punch just because they did something weird around earnings--after an infinite green stretch. I'm just noting that there could be other factors, but I am not worried about it, NVDA will keep on keepin on. \n\n\n* * *\n\n[Here is an investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/04/100804.asp) article  describing the differences in technical factors, fundamental factors, and market sentiment.

I would suggest looking for reports and info on that side of its operations.

One of the most important lessons any investor can learn is to stay invested, even during market downturns.

     "My opinion is hard disagree.  I haven't seen truly bearish sentiment at all.  People who have been investing for a few years can't recognize bearishness, they seem to think anything slightly negative but true is a \"bearish talking point\" or \"doomsday conspiracy theories.\"  People cherry pick parts of earnings calls and Jerome speeches and ignore anything slightly negative.  People are complaining out one side of their mouth about not being able to afford life despite having a good job then out the other side screech at anyone who hints a recession is coming is a conspiracy theorist.\n\nI have a watch list of close to 200 stocks and none are undervalued right now.  That is almost unprecedented. During \"normal\" times, a random amount, maybe 10-20% will be in a dip for either no reason or for a made up reason (such as articles that Amazon will enter so and so industry). That's how I made money.  I would think, is there a reason this good company is cheap, not find one, buy it, and it would go up in 6 months.  Now, every darn this is overpriced. Boomer dividend low growth stocks. Tech stocks. Old falling apart used cars in the middle of nowhere.  Dumpy houses in the middle of nowhere in need of expensive repairs.  The economic situation is actually worse in 2008 in the sense that then, broke people bought houses they had no business buying. Now 6-figure earners are struggling to afford basics.\n\nI'm also seeing loads of \"Q4 earnings was bad but we're raising or keeping high guidance\" comments in earnings calls which has me scratching my head.  Do people actually believe all of this? And I'm also never lived through so much skewing of earnings calls.  Like, the market and investors used to just take lower earnings and bad guidance at face value. I also really wish people grasped the \"just because someone beat expectations doesn't mean earnings are up\" concept.\n\nBear markets end when people who buy \"real\" companies (not bankrupt companies, not 20 year old tech companies with PEs of 200) get scared and stop buying the freaking dip for two seconds.  I'm watching all of these stocks and the market won't let them drop more than a few percent points. This used to only happen in roaring bull markets."

     "We have bottomed, for now. Building up bubbles is bullish. Since we hit the bottom savings have gone down for americans but not for the China, which has gone up.\n\nSo what is really happening? A alternating series of kicking it down the road, masking of indications, and mini bubble ruptures.\n\nHowever, dollar milkshake theory and the everything bubble exists. As traders, we shouldn\u2019t be bullish or bearish. Government intervention is not only the reason for the crash but also the reason it doesn\u2019t crash. \n\nEverybody has reason to be bullish or bearish. The market \u201cpriced everything in\u201d is not real. Every bubble is bound to pop eventually so it should go down right? Since it\u2019s forward looking\u2026..Newsflash, it\u2019s forward looking to \u201ca degree\u201d. If JPOW says anything other than 25 bps, the market will react, which isn\u2019t pricing in shit. \n\nEven with 25 bps, the market will probably dip. Just because of the mechanics of strengthening the dollar and the algos selling in reaction. \n\nIf JPOW is dovish, go bullish, if he hawkish, go bearish. Mainly because the economic phenomenon is difficult for anyone to wrap their heads around completely (I\u2019m studying all the time and keep getting conflicting signals). \n\nIt is very likely JPOW will screw this up by either being too hawkish or dovish and will overshoot. Just don\u2019t fight  \u201cTHE MARKETS PERCEPTION OF FED\u201d. JPOW very commonly \u201cspooks\u201d the market, and the market moves in tandem with JPOW, only for them to, at some random point of good news, start fighting the fed and moving in the opposite directions."

     "So easy to mitigate something like this:\n\n* You and your spouse cannot purchase individual stocks or options while you are serving in Congress. Only index funds.\n* Term limits. There shouldn't be a reason for career politicians. If you can do the job, you don't need 30+ years to prove so.\n* After your term limit, you are prevented from owning individual stocks for a one-year period.\n\nThese three simple things would prevent the majority of abuse. You won't prevent them all as Nancy can easily gossip to her wealthier friends but something like that would be impossible to forcibly prevent. If you're a politician who is 'serving the public', investing in stocks shouldn't be a priority for you as it has been for Nancy."

     "The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn\u2019t fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don\u2019t realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.  \n     This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out."

I sold when the panic started \\(options trader, gotta capitalize on dips\\) and decided to wait until closer to earnings for a better entry point.  I bought around $219. The current price is as good as any going in to earnings. AMD already demonstrated that cards are selling plentiful \\(even though AMD is an after thought for most buyers if they cant find Nvidia. Like settling for a BBW when nothing better is available\\).\n\nThe other issue was the AI in self driving cars... even with the deaths that has caused panic. This is still inevitably where we are going as a society and companies will go to NVDA for powerful chips that support this tech. \\(so long term this is nothing to worry about, self driving car deaths will not compare to what drunk drivers have achieved already\\). \n\nOther than that, whats not to like?

It made huge profits in the last few years mostly thanks to the mining and ai markets, and used the chip shortage issues to try to establish higher pricing baselines. Now what it got is: currency mining market dipping, and even selling out their former, still current-gen cards. Ai market shrinking as well, with competition coming even from unexpected players such as Google and Aws. Gaming is taking advantage of stocks being sold from mining operations, or waiting for prices to get lower, or for the next gen, or trying out Amd for better value. I can see Nv value stabilising in the long term, but I fear the gold mining rush is over now."

The stock sky rockets and then once they see something is wrong, they take their massive profits and head on home. The stock plummets and goes nowhere, or goes to zero. Institutions don\u2019t believe it in anymore and likely they already see new stocks that deserve to be bought instead. So they\u2019ll be moving on. This is called a broken leader, don\u2019t be an idiot and think your somehow strategically buying a dip of something Wall Street shat in the bin. Your supposed to be buying what Wall Streets buying.

Their operating expenses were down 4% from $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion. Seeing as though they did not have successful net income in the second quarter, they were up 115%. This can be attributable to the release of the GeForce RTX 3090, the latest graphics processing unit (GPU) for gamers and crypto miners. Consistently sold out in stores, Nvidia's new product helped their net income, rising to $1.3 billion in the quarter. \\n\\n \\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cl2vzew8xaj61.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=352d6431d582f2e84fdad2d07b4da7706b7ce429\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents from the beginning of the year to October have decreased slightly by $7 million. Otherwise, current assets have increased about $1 billion from January 26, 2020 to the Q3 Report. Total assets gained about $10 billion as we see Nvidia investing more into Goodwil\"",

The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.  \\n\\nThe major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.\\n\\nBut once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.\\n\\nOthers, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.\\n\\n**Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule. \\n\\nMegacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**)\"",

Kathy Manning, D-N.C., scooped up thousands of dollars in semiconductor company stock just one day before voting to pass a bill providing massive subsidies to the sector, new disclosures show. One of the companies is already planning large-scale investments made possible due to the legislation.\\n\\nManning and her husband purchased up to $30,000 in Micron Technology stocks and up to $95,000 in Nvidia stocks on July 27, the new disclosures show. The next day, Manning voted to pass the CHIPS Act, which will help expand semiconductor manufacturing facilities in the United States while providing the industry tens of billions of dollars in subsidies.\\n\\nThe legislation received plenty of media attention prior to the vote, particularly concerning stock investments made by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\\'s husband.\\n\\n\"I\\'m proud of my vote to pass this historic investment in American CHIP manufacturing, lower costs, and creating good-paying jobs,\" Manning tweeted after the vote.\\n\\nM'",

Perhaps driven to a degree by the banks, the IWM is showing the most bearish chart with clear bear flag consolidation.  SPY could be viewed more neutrally with price stuck in a consolidation zone between two major TLs; however, when you factor the IWM and QQQ, probabilities suggest the break will go to the downside.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**SPY**:  Price remains stuck between two bearish levels: macro bear channel ceiling & the mico downsloping TL from the February 2023 pivot high.  A parralel channel upsloping TL entered the picture this week, which will eventually 'pinch' price to the upside or downside (probabilities favor the downside, look at the Weekly bearish consolidation).  385.65 is the support level to watch this week, the cross-point of the upsloping TL and bear channel TL.  On the resistance side, 401.\"",

     "My beaten up portfolio is now pretty much almost dead, my hard earned money gone. Someone told me earlier that retail investors only exist to get r\\*ped by algos and major players. I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started \"investing.\" The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  \n\n\nedit: downvoted for being a loser i already know"

With most people barely able to afford to keep up with cost of living increase and energy prices likely driving inflation further? \n\nNone of this is possible. The bull run of the past 20 years was created with low rates and free $. We now pay the consequences. There is NO WAY to stop inflation without deep recession as we have to destroy labor market to stop wage inflation. Recession should last through 2024 (just like in Europe ). Housing, coins, all stocks which don\u2019t make $ should crash as people with no jobs will be forced to liquidate. The fed will eventually cut rates due to recession but it\u2019s too late. 2025 we start over and rebuild. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we hit bottom sometime end of next year at around s and p 2700, which would be in line with other bear markets."

     "In response to the first picture, it\u2019s going to take something strange or significant occurring for the S&P to trade 4600 in the next 12-13 months honestly. The closest we got to it making sense was in August where it looked like rates were going to wind up back in the multi-decade downtrend, then the massive jawboning by the Fed started, which caused some major whiplash there (I didn\u2019t expect 4600 to come in a straight line at that point, but in the remote world where it did occur it\u2019d have been near the end of the year or early next).\n\nThe best case is likely 4300 unless the long-end winds up back under 3 and I feel like there\u2019s essentially a 0% chance of this occurring without some bad crap going down, and if the bad crap takes it under, the S&P is not trading 4600 in that scenario.\n\nIf October was it for a few months, I think 4100 can trade again before EoY, but it\u2019s just as likely that October was just like July and the S&P ends up at 3400 or something on December 31st. In a world where we\u2019re at 4100 or at the very least, 3490ish sticks as the low for 2022, I think Q1 next year marks the low.\n\nBut if 3490ish doesn\u2019t stick, the odds of a secular bear get pretty high, so all of the averages double bottom with their COVID lows in the first half of 2023."

I just .don't think the market can crash right now (without a black swan event) because we just have too much liquidity... I also think that rates have topped for the rest of the year before they move higher in '23. Then I believe the Dollar is about to cool off as well and all of this will allow tech room to rally and breath, before it's clear that the recession is actually here and earnings are negative. So I think somewhere in between Q1/Q2 of '23 is when the market actually bottoms. \n\nAs a side note: Markets usually make new highs after yield curve inversions but before the recession hits... So I could see this playing out similarly where we go on a crazy strong rally into EOY... I just don't see new highs... but perhaps the Dow could make a new high, while SPY and Q's underperform... just like what we have seen recently"

     "Great research! Provides some nice  insights onthe current market. \n\nFrom Powell's transcript,  there are still billions of spending awaiting to be injected into the economy. ( Chips act, bipartisan , ) Powell been slow playing the game, easing investors into high rate environment.  Inflation is around 6.6% in September.(this is excluding food and energy data as well, otherwise would be higher) Even if Powell increase rate by 75 basis pts in december, fed rate is still much much too low. \nPowell emphasized again on how firm they are in maintaining 2% inflation. The expectation of rate increase during this round was 4.4% next year, now after this latest update, market is expecting 5+ %. \n\nNotice how they are slowly raising the expectation? \n\nHow does this impact our economy? Aside from what op said about liquid and dealers holding the bag.... All sorts of debts we are seeing.  30 year housing rate is at 7% right now  (highest since 2002) and mortgage application have crashed to the bottom.(lowest since 1997)  This directly translates to housing crisis in the making. (Those who does Airbnb arbitrage will probably suffer the most.). Moreover, the housing sales so far ONLY dropped by 25% comparing to last year.  (This is not even shown on the government's inflation data.) \n\nPowell have been dodging all the serious questions about these impact not being captured on the CPI/PCE data. The housing data they have collects only rent and etc.... Doesn't even touch the housing price. (Supporting data is from Bureau of labor statistics using their shelter index to measure the cost of housing for both renters and the homeowners. \"Focuses on the rent tenant pays and how much the rent equivalent would be if home owner rented a party similar to their own.\"  This is ridiculous method as it would experience huge delay and cannot capture the REAL housing data in real time. .....to put it into perspective, if housing price crashes but not to the point it impacts the rental price, their data will not even acknowledge of the housing crash. \n\nPowell is not done yet. All these cover ups or purposely NOT mentioning/excluding critical data leads me to believe ..... It's still too early to dca into \"value companies.\" There may very well be some fake rallies done by these so called \"dealers\" so they can find bag holders (retail investors) then they'll find positions to take advantage again. \n\nOh right. Midterm election. Lol I dunno if that's not market manipulation , what is.  Anyway, fake rallies, then at least one or two more big drop in the market. \n\nPs Volker back in the days curbed their inflation of like 14% or something by raising rate to 20%. If Powell is so adament on curbing the inflation this time, I'm pretty sure interest rate will have to be much higher than current rate."

     "Yeah.  Warren Buffett\u2019s point is that is is next to impossible for the average investor, or even sophisticated investors, to outperform the market over a long period of time so best idea is to just buy the market hence his suggested S&P 500 (or one of the many ETFs that mirrors it).  You can go broader or pick up international via similar ETFs that each have their theoretical pluses and minuses but basically the same theory.  That 25% of the index is in 5 names is troublesome but that is unlikely to last for all sorts of reasons.    \n\n\nIf you were good enough to buy the winners (before they were winners) and sell the losers (before they became losers) you\u2019d obviously beat the market.  There are various strategies that, if implemented religiously, historically have beaten the market but once enough folks find out about them, the excess returns are arbitraged away as others pile into the strategy.  Most people can\u2019t and, as a practical matter, don\u2019t really have the time for any of this."

Too much F\u2019king money that every one has trying to make something happen. We are going lower as rates go higher. I\u2019ve mentioned before we need to see a 40 % down Nasdaq, a 28k Dow and at least a 3400 SPX where everyone will get scared shitless and get out and then the long term players can finally get back in.  The Fed is finally taking the punch bowl away and letting the gamblers lose their money.  You could see this coming a mile away. Just too many young investors never dealing that yes, you can buy the dips as long as you realize you may bloody your hand on the falling knife. I don\u2019t know what kind of holiday season we will have but the consumer may either buy because there\u2019s no tomorrow or save their money for the high priced groceries, doctor bills, high gas prices and losing their job. The only good news is \u2026 one day next year it may all be over and the sun will shine again. Se la vie."

She said that the House would take up the issue this month, before adjourning for the midterm elections. But on Thursday, Representative Steny H.

     "As usual everyone isn\u2019t looking at the big picture. Todays sell off is simply the beginning of the downturns in the markets. F Amazon. F Apple. F the fangs and look out below. Stubborn inflation will result in all stocks being downgraded until we have a 12 PE ( or worse ) and interest rates about 5 percent ( or higher) and people start getting laid off. Anecdotal stories of the housing markets are JUST starting! I suspect the October GDP will not only show another downturn but according to the third time in a row it represents a depression. There are too many people betting on a pivot, a turnaround, a sudden miracle where the markets will suddenly go up. Not happening. The VIX had to hit higher than 40 ( doesn\u2019t mean a capitulation) and can go higher still. Higher interest rates will send NASDAQ below 10k to 9500, a 40% decline ( not unusual for these stocks) and an SPX below 3400.  This is a bear market. Cash is king. Listening to those long term pundits who won\u2019t care about the pain you are suffering only means they want your assets so they can profit on your portfolios. But then again, what\u2019s going on may be too late for most of us. After all, new investors ( all you kids 40 years old and younger ) all believe in buying the dips. After your lessons this year and next you can learn what it means to be \u201cprudent\u201d."
