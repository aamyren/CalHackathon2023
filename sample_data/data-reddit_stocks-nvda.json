Is their industry becoming obsolete? If no, what is the negative selection bias? They are clearly on the bleeding edge of tech. They invented the graphics card. They have a huge moat. If AI takes off, they will profit full stop. Until there is a reason to believe they are not doing well, why shouldn\u2019t they go up? Because they are overvalued? Where in the stock market are companies equally valued when compared among sectors? Basic material stocks don\u2019t command the same prices as industrials stocks even with comparable growth trajectories and evaluations. Is Amazon trading at a reasonable multiple? What about coca-cola, McDonald\u2019s, or Walmart? Based on historical S&P 500 averages, the answer is no for all of them. But if the company isn\u2019t going to go out of business, what is the likelihood you think you will make money overtime? Unlike many sectors, semiconductors have their futures mapped out 5+ years on their expansion trajectory. Currently, NVIDIA\u2019s 10 year Avg CAGR is 20%+. What is your argument for why Nvidia is going to be dethroned, because until sentiment changes, their stock trajectory is going to continue with its growth inertia. We are going into an economic downturn that everyone believes will not last for an extended period of time. That means future projections are inconclusive, so the bet is I am getting in cheap on a 5 year retrospective scale given the businesses consistency. Additionally, keep in mind a subsection of the stock market is all short term momentum trading. It\u2019s like betting on the weather, the best indication of tomorrow\u2019s weather is what happened today."

If yes, how many?\\n\\nOr do we think NVDA is going to increase significantly more in 5-10 years?\\n\\nThe rationale for selling would be to lock in the profits and invest in other stocks that might have higher chance of going up where NVDA might not have enough growth left in it in mid term.\\n\\nWhats a good strategy?\\n\\nThanks!\\n\\nUpdate: I have decided to sell about 250 of them next week unless the price drops below $380.\\n\\nThanks everyone for taking the time to respond. Appreciate it.\\n\\nUpdate 2: If you are curious about my own opinion as someone in the deep learning industry for 5/6 years, my forecast is we are NOT in a bubble. The hype of AI is justified. NVDA might actually cross $500. But I still want to realize at least some profit.'",

You keep the shares and the premium of $3100/contract which in the above you sell 2-5 contracts. But what if it drops to $300.  You missed the chance to sell at $390 but you still got $31/share.  But you noted longer term you think it goes higher.  So you still have that. \n\nGoes over $400 maybe to $500+.  Welp you get the $400 + $31 or $431 which is 10% higher for 82 days.  Typically a nice return and is over 40% annualized.

There was almost certainly a margin call post earnings around 6pm on Wednesday. A large bid was seen chasing the ask with around 10000 lots. This however was aggressively eaten up as soon as price entered the $390-$395 range. The next morning another attempt to break $400 was aggressively shorted suggesting an institution is very happy to add/initiate shorts at this level or take profits aggressively.\n\nThe question I ask myself is, what institutions are happy and willing to buy at this current price instead of waiting for a pullback to a more reasonable level ($300-$350)? I always try to do what the institutions are doing, and right now it is more probable that they are taking profits instead of adding to their long positions."

Yes nvidia has the best performing cards but that doesn't count out companies like amd and intel yet. No one knows what tech will look like in 2030 yet. And if they do they are just making up some bs. Some companies may weigh cost verse performance and instead rely on other cards. Some companies will design their own in house hardware. So at this point it is hard to tell what nvidia will look like by then. I am sure they will be successful but not the extent of being a monopoly as people are saying. I can definitely see them being a leader for sure but as I said they are pricing in growth for a long time here and there are just better opportunity in the market for returns for over the next few years."

     "It's just dumb to short NVDA because at best it's a great company that's overvalued. TSLA was literally going bankrupt a few years back, so it's not really a fair comparison.\n\nAnd while I'd argue it's massively overvalued relative to other tech valuations, it's probably not that overvalued if you believe they can achieve 50% growth rates for several years while maintaining 30-40% net profit margins. In such a scenario you shouldn't expect huge returns, but it should at least match or slightly beat the historical returns of the S&P500.\n\nI think the other reason institutional investors love NVDA is because it's a hedge against upside AI risk. If AI stocks go crazy for the next decade then any institutional investor who doesn't have a position is going to underperform. These guys also have clients calling them non-stop right now asking them what their strategy is in regards to AI and so again to keep these clients happy you kinda need a position in companies like NVDA.\n\nPersonally my main issue with investing in NVDA is that I don't see the long-term moat. Companies buying AI chips just want to get the most compute for the lowest cost. A competitor doesn't need to beat NVDA in terms of compute, they simply need to offer a product that can compete on price. With lots of companies now beginning to build their own AI-optimised chips I worry whether NVDA can defend their margins. If they execute well I think they probably can, but when you have a stretched valuation that's not really good enough."

     "A couple reasons imho.\n\nThe first one is earnings growth can compress PE. Yeah, NVDA has a PE ratio currently of 200+. But Tesla at one point had a PE ratio of over 1000 and today sits closer to 80.\n\nIf AI truly is a highly demanded field going forward, NVDA could actually grow earnings at 50%+ yearly, which is enough to compress PE over time and make it worth more than it is today. But that\u2019s the question. Just like when TSLA was projected to grow at similar rates. TSLA ultimately slowed down when the stock came down, but AI chips are a bigger deal and way more applicable to most tech companies then EVs were. \n\nUltimately I think whether you think NVDA is a bubble or not depends highly on your view of what AI demand will be in the coming years. All it takes for a significant pullback in NVDA is one bad earnings where they report AI demand has slowed. Or a market pullback in tech in general.\n\nThe other part of the equation is delta hedging from options selling. NVDA calls are expensive right now so MMs love to sell them. But if they\u2019re selling 0.2-0.3 delta calls, they need to hedge by buying 20-30 shares, which obviously pushes the price higher when there are a lot of calls being sold. There\u2019s 200k+ volume on NVDA calls expiring tomorrow alone"

Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. \\n\\nI also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.\\n\\nI do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.\\n\\nSeems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts s'",

     "The stock has these swings in price quite often. Whenever the current hype cycle heats up / dies down investors can't decide if the company should be valued on its fundamentals or on the hype.\n\nI've argued for a while that it's massively overvalued which I think is a fairly uncontroversial view, but then again it's a one of a kind company with a very clear path for future growth. If you're willing to assume growth and profit margins remain robust then the current valuation probably makes some sense. If you believe that the growth may not be as strong as the market hopes it will be, or believe they will face more competition and lower profit margins in the future then the price becomes extremely hard to justify.\n\nThat's kind of the issue with NVDA... The valuation can be whatever you want within a range of something like $80 - $250. That said, in my opinion at these levels there's limited upside and a lot of downside risk, but I'm always surprised how high prices can go when the market gets excited about things."

They shot up like crazy when Zuck announced that Meta is basically going all in on metaverse. Because it meant that they'd be supplying the chips. Also with Omniverse NVDA has a competent solution already for digital twins. This is the surge you see when it went from $208 to $330 within 1.5 months (8th of Oct to 19th of Nov).\n\nIt helped that there was a general tech craze in the 2nd half of 2021 and that NVDA was generally doing well with selling A100s and 3000 series cards. But the actual craziness of the valuation came from the metaverse hype and NVDA being well positioned for it.\n\nAnd btw: The actual high was above $340, it was an intraday high that you're not gonna see on a chart showing daily prices only."

     "Is time to recover this gem written by Peter Lynch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You\u2019ll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*\r  \n\r  \n*A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that\u2019s been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald\u2019s was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald\u2019s could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with McDonald\u2019s. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*\r  \n\r  \n*And if McDonald\u2019s was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot\u2019s company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*\r  \n\r  \n*If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you\u2019d just be breaking even today.*\r  \n\r  \n*I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: \u201cDue to the recent bankruptcy, we\u2019re removing this stock from our buy list.\u201d In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I\u2019ve ever seen before or since.*\r  \n\r  \n*You often hear about companies whose future performance is \u201cdiscounted\u201d in the stock price. If that\u2019s the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*\r  \n\r  \n*When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64\u2014though nowhere near as extreme as EDS\u2019s. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It\u2019s a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon\u2019s earnings didn\u2019t grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18\u215d in 1974.*\r  \n\r  \n*The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*\r  \n\r  \n*The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14\u215b in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid\u2019s p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*\r  \n\r  \n*Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn\u2019t have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*"

Here's some bullet points of why:\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nCovid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.\r  \n\r  \nAI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.\r  \n\r  \nHigh Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.\r  \n\r  \nInsider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years. The worst is that the CFO is now doing it which is the one person in the company that knows best about valuations.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want more details you can watch my video on YouTube by searching 'NVDA TickerTaco'."

Therefore, I'd rather throw $10k at a gamble like this with 300-1000% upside if it works, than throw $50k at puts that expire 6-12 months from now with 50-200% upside. I know I'm simplifying the greeks drastically, but the essence is that if timing is impossible, might as well risk less capital for higher upside potential. If the first $10k position blows up, this gives me the opportunity to sit back, relax, and wait to potentially reload another position in the near future.\n\nWhereas if I got the entry price wrong for a larger, deeper put - they will have lost 30-60% of their value anyway. From a psychology perspective, it's much easier for me to dismiss a smaller position loss and cut my chasing rather than hoping for my large, bleeding position to recoup it's value. Waiting for deep OTM puts to recover is mentally exhausting and draining."

Keep DCA into your index/mutual fund, and for single stocks only buy if it looks like a great deal, ie. as you mentioned Nvidia was down to $110 at one point, which was maybe a good time to buy and DCA. \n\nRight now it looks super expensive(more than 50% market  cap of amazon), but I can be wrong on this also."

People who panic like you that sell lower than cost is when non panic people make a lot of money.  I bought a lot of stock when the SNP was 4,800. When it hit 3,600, people who panic sold sold sold.  I doubled down and bought what I could.  Now it is already past 4,000.  So, fight the urge, my friend, and you will do better."

Also want to see how their foundry business will compete with tsm. We will find out over the next few years. I like intel here in the 20\u2019s. But they have definitely dropped the ball in recent years. They are taking steps to turn the business back around but we won\u2019t see the fruits of that labor at least for a few more years. At this point it\u2019s more of a long term speculative play than a short term bet. If they can turn the business around yes they are very undervalued but if not it will just keep sinking.

That's the actual reason reddit lost faith in the company.\n\nI remember when redditors used to bash Apple for their overpriced products, at least until most of them silently caved in and bought an iPhone while Apple became the most valuable company in the world despite the redditor hate.\n\nRedditors are probably hoping competitors like Intel and AMD can force Nvidia to lower their prices so they can buy Nvidia products.\n\nThey're disingenuous when they point to Nvidia's declining financials as fundamentals when they know their long-term trajectory is growth because the crypto impact and drop from pandemic-level demand are one-off events. Therefore, using PE ratio is useless because it's distorted by the one-off events.\n\nThere's zero doubt that computing power requirements are going to go WAY up from this low point, with AI and all.

Now, the common thought is that the recession won't even happen, or it'll be extremely mild to the point where we won't even feel it.\n\nTherefore growth stocks climbed like crazy. If the recession turns out to be worse than assumed, then it will dramatically drop. On a company like Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, etc.. you're betting on the future growth of the company, and the company stock becomes much more valuable when future outlook doesn't look so grim.\n\nIt's very different than say.. a company like AT&T, or Target. Yes investors care about future outlook too with these but it won't make or break the company. They are mostly out of their growth stage and are more stable than Nvidia."

Have you done something like this before? Is it historically a bad idea? Does it make sense if I have to pay $5 per buy/sell?\\n\\n**2/23/2023 Update:** I did not sell even after today's monster run up. The reason being: 42/62 of my shares are at 249 avg and are in my TFSA. If I sell, I'll take a loss and lose the contribution room. \\n\\nHowever,  if this wasn't the case, I would have sold.

     "You really have to dive into the balance sheets and long term outlooks if you want a fundamental response. Both stocks are very highly valued which means the growth in the stock will largely need to come from revenue/profit growth. It looks like both companies are set up to do that. If you want to make an AI play I would lean towards NVDA because they have products already on the market (A100) and deals already in place (ex Lockheed Martin). \n\nBut just keep in mind there are many ways to play AI or even semis. I think NVDA or AMD could get hit hard if they don\u2019t execute perfectly. For this reason I chose a supplier of Wager Manufacturing equipment. In this way I am playing the same space without taking the same risk (IMO). The company I am in trade at an attractive valuation to the market with a small dividend. \n\nAnother way to mitigate risk is by buying the stock and selling CCs or CSPs against your position to generate income/lower cost basis. But don\u2019t do this unless you know what you are doing. A credit spread can also achieve this. \n\nBest of luck!"

     "This is gonna be lost in the late replies, but you should be aware of a major potential hit to amd stock price in the pipeline. They launched their flagship gpu the 7900 xtx with a critical design flaw that also affects third-party sellers of that gpu. They are currently downplaying this issue, but in reality, they are probably facing a major class action lawsuit or a total recall. It isn't readily apparent outside of enthusiasts yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if it dipped heavily once the news properly breaks. \n\nMight be a good idea to purchase after, but I sold my position (potentially prematurely). This launch also raises real questions about their internal QA as this was a real big miss (the cards overheat when mounted horizontally, ie normally, but operate just fine in vertical, like test rigs and mining rigs). It seems they just didn't test the card for average use case, which, to me, signals management are accountants/marketing and not engineers. \n\nIf you're curious, just Google 7900 xtx + vapor chamber for corroborating info."

Now their primary revenue source comes from data center. \n\nAnother important point is that revenues to USA was 12% 5 years ago, now it's 30% (and their largest)\n\nSo instead of selling to Asus, Gigabyte and MSI who sell Nvidia GPUs to gamers, they're now selling to US businesses.\n\nTo answer whether they are buy or sell, we need to ask whether you believe in the story of the data center?\n\nThe giants AWS, Azure and GCP are all growing at 30%+ even 40% YoY which means demand for data center requirements grow too.\n\nWe need to estimate what their data center revenue might be in 5 years.\n\nAt 30% each year for 5 years, we arrive at 56bn revenue per year. \n\nApply 30% operating margin and you arrive at massive numbers (17bn op profit from data center)\n\nOf course, it all depends on what their growth will be. Their other segments still exist too, do we assign a $0 price tag on them?"

This decreases the energy usage of the network by over 99%. Fun fact: the energy to run the network was about the same amount of energy used by the entire country of Chile.\n\nThe decrease in energy use is because the switch to proof-of-stake means those massive banks of graphics cards are no longer required to mine ETH. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think that this will impact the demand for those cards which we\u2019ve seen the last few years. I wonder wether the change in demand will have a significant impact on their top line. \n\nNoteably - this is likely priced in at this point; \u2018The Merge\u2019 has been widely known about for months now. Just worth noting it happened this week and was a success (so far) so is unlikely to be reversed. \n\nBTW - bitcoin isn\u2019t (and likely will never as I understand it) switch away from proof-of-work, \n\nEdit: removed comment about BTC miners continuing to use GPUs - they use ASICs per comment below"

Rather, I'm out of the market because macro conditions are bad and getting worse. I'm starting to look for companies that might thrive as the global economy contracts, and I'm looking for signs that we might be in undervalued territory, or even the middle of fair value.\n\nThat is, I buy and hold for about a decade at a time, and I get out when the whole economy signals big trouble. That is a scale of market timing that can work out.\n\nThe scale you're talking about is speculation. You're not basing your sell point and buy point on fundamentals. At best, you're attempting short-term technical analysis that you haven't really studied. As worst, you are playing a hunch.\n\nYou can make money playing hunches, but you are likely to lose money about about the same rate.

Use good trend analysis to your benefit.\n\nFor everyone saying buy the dip - if the VIX pops and rotates the bull flag this dip could be much much worse for all risk assets. Every stock in the QQQ will be hit hard (the higher risk the harder) and NVDA is well within this bunch of assets. My advice if you are risk averse is to watch and react rather than buy because the price seems too good to be true (don\u2019t fight the fed - they\u2019re gonna pump interest rates at least until the end of the year - there isn\u2019t going to be a \u2018soft landing\u2019)."

Raytheon is a good substitute.\n\n\n\n $DIS, so much IP along with Disney plus and Hulu. Along with parks, cruises, toys, etc. Get in now at 2019 prices but with 2022 revenue! Might go down more but might not. This company will be around in 20 years.\n\n \n\n$ ODFL, the country needs shipping and this company does it well. Recession could hurt demand but they can weather through it. Solid stock and top in the business imo. \n\n\n\n $SBUX, had a lot of headwinds with pulling. Out of Russia and China zero covid. Also getting a new ceo so price is rough. But dominating in the US. Record revenue even tho the headwinds are rough. Even in a recession the most addictive drug in the world will be there to ease your pain.\n\n\nand $CROX who doesn\u2019t love a funky shoe? You can badazelle them with $9 clip ons that get lost but your kid screams so much you keep buying more! Currently at a 9 p/e. Who knows why people love this hideous shoe, but the numbers speak for itself \ud83e\udd37\n\n\n\nImo these are each the top of what they do. Each company will be here in 10-20 years unless the business models change. They aren\u2019t tech and likely won\u2019t have tech growth, but they also won\u2019t keep you up at night holding them (usually)."

They sold way less GPU for the gaming market because these unused GPU that served the crypto mining business were re-sold on secondary markets to gamers.\n\nOnce the crypto crisis end (which btw was caused by the FED hiking rates so it won't last much longer), there is gonna be a huge increase in GPU demand. This is all temporary, nothing wrong at all with Nvidia business which is extremely strong and they are at the forefront of the AI revolution. Moreover with inflation at almost 10% the real stock price of Nvidia (in last year term) is 10% less than it's quoted today...so if it's 180$ now it's equal to roughly 162$/share last year.\n\nThis is a company that I'll never sell for 10 years. One of my highest conviction picks along with Google, AMD and Palo Alto Networks."

As a casual observer the macro for NVDA seems worse this time, but even after this recent drop NVDA has only gotten back to peak 2018 multiples. Back then it bottomed out with a PE in the low 20s, today it's trading with a 50 PE.\n\nI get why people like the stock and I've owned it a number of times over the last few years, but I can't bring myself to buy it at the moment. I might be wrong, but I still think there's a good chance this stock will be trading in the low $100s at some point over the next 12 months."

Honestly they spent more time saying \"sign up for our new managed AI service starting in q4\" than they spent talking about the consumer GPU. \n\nImo it comes down to how profitable do you believe managed AI service and the \"omniverse\" will be over the next 1-3 years."

     "I read through the financials of NVDA and this is why I'm bearish on NVDA:\n\n1. Flat Revenue growth YoY (3% growth from Aug 21). Declining Revenue growth Quarter over quarter. It went from 8.3B to 6.7B in the last earnings release. \n\n2. Spiking cost of revenue. This was 2.3B Aug 21. It's now at 3.8B in the last earnings. It's also increasing quarter over quarter. \n\n3. This leads to a huge decline to gross profit. 4.2B a year ago to 2.9B today. Same picture with Quarter over Quarter. \n\n4. Operating expenses have also ballooned. 1.8B a year ago to 2.4B today. This means they posted only 500M of operating income, compared to 2.5B a year ago.\n\n5. NVDA announced that their Q3 outlook is only 5.9B in revenue. That's another quarter of steep decline. I doubt they'll be able to reduce cost fast enough to keep up. I would expect them to lose money next quarter. BTW - I don't believe this estimate was done after the executive order to stop supplying China with their chips.\n\n6. The PE as of today's closing price is around 40. For a company to be worth 40 PE, you need to show 25%+ revenue growth IMO. So you need to see 9.5B. I am not hopeful that they can go from 5.9B next quarter to 9.5B by end of 2023. \n\n\nA company with <5% Revenue growth (and decelerating) and quickly eroding margin does not deserve 40PE. I would expect it to be around 13x-15x PE. So based on this analysis, I would think a fair market value for NVDA is around $60. Another 55%-60% decrease in price."

     "Hmm... \"losing confidence in NVDA?\" NVDA is down over 50%, so do U need more proof?\n\n**Can chip giant NVIDIA shrug off China sales ban?**\n\n***The share price for chip giant NVIDIA (NVDA) has fallen more than 53% year-to-date***\n\nAnalysts have reduced their price targets after the company revised down its earnings outlook in August, and the US government-imposed restrictions on NVIDIA selling chips to China and Russia.\n\n*Is now a good time to trade the stock?*\n\n**History of NVIDIA**\n\nNVIDIA was founded in the US in 1993 by electrical engineers Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Huang currently serves as the company\u2019s CEO, Malachowsky remains a senior executive and Priem retired from the company in 2003.\n\nNVIDIA invented the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) in 1999, a high-performance processor that generates interactive graphics for virtual reality, high performance computing and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNVIDIA reported its first $1bn-revenue quarter in 2007 and shipped its 1 billionth graphics processor in 2011.\n\nIn September 2020, the company announced plans to acquire UK chip designer Arm from Japanese investment firm SoftBank (9984) for $40bn. However, the deal collapsed under opposition from UK regulatory authorities, with NVIDIA announcing the termination of the transaction on 7 February 2022.\n\nOn 6 May, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) agreed a $5.5m settlement with NVIDIA over the company\u2019s failure to disclose in 2018 that cryptocurrency mining was a significant source of revenues from sales of its GPUs designed for gaming.\n\nNVIDIA stock slumps on as trade war compounds slowdown\n\nBased on NVDA stock historical prices, shares reached an all-time intraday high of $334.12 on 29 November 2021, with lockdowns around the world increasing demand for computing and entertainment systems. The stock had been trading around $51 in March 2020 at the start of pandemic-related restrictions.\n\nThe share price began to retreat as technology stocks sold-off heading into 2022. NVDA started the year at $301.21 a share and dropped to $219.44 on 27 January. It rebounded to $267.05 on 9 February and $286.56 on 29 March, but began to fall sharply in April as analysts started to downgrade the stock on signs of slowing consumer demand for GPUs and concerns about the impact of high inflation.\n\nTechnology stocks have borne the brunt of stock market selloffs, as central banks, including the US Federal Reserve (Fed), have begun aggressively raising interest rates and some investors have shifted from stocks to fixed-income assets.\n\nThe NVDA share price fell to the $161 level in May and despite an uptick to $195.92 in June, continued to decline, reaching $145.23 on 1 July. The stock rose to $192.15 on 4 August, but was unable to hold at that level.\n\nOn 24 August, NVIDIA reported revenue for its fiscal second quarter ended 31 July of $6.7bn, up 3% from the same period in 2021, but down 19% from the previous quarter. Earnings per share fell to $0.26, down by 72% from a year earlier and 59% lower than the previous quarter.\n\nJensen Huang said:\n\n\u201cWe are navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment and we will get through this.\u201d\n\nThe share price rose from $171.81 on 23 August to $179.13 on 25 August, but at least 14 Wall Street analysts downgraded their ratings on the stock on 25 August amid expectations of lower projected growth, weighing on the share price as investors sold the stock in response. The share price ended the month at $150.94.\n\nNVDA dropped to $139.37 on 1 September in response to an SEC filing that the US government had informed the company on 26 August of a new license requirement for exports to China and Russia for the company\u2019s A100 and H100 integrated circuits and any products that incorporate them.\n\nThe government indicated that the license is intended to \u201caddress the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a \u2018military end use\u2019 or \u2018military end user\u2019 in China and Russia.\u201d\n\nNVIDIA said that it \u201cdoes not sell products to customers in Russia,\u201d but \u201cthe new license requirement may impact the Company's ability to complete its development of H100 in a timely manner or support existing customers of A100 and may require the Company to transition certain operations out of China.\u201d\n\nBased on the outlook NVIDIA provided for its third fiscal quarter in its results on 24 August, approximately $400m in potential sales to China could be subject to the new license requirement, the company said in the filing.\n\nThe NVDA share price subsequently dropped to $134.65 on 6 September, its lowest level since March 2021. The stock then ticked higher to close at $139.90 on 8 September.\n\nWhat is the outlook for the NVIDIA share price after the selloff? Can it rebound or will it remain under pressure? Let\u2019s look at some future predictions from analysts.\n\nSeveral Wall Street analysts downgraded their stock expectations in response to the US government\u2019s licensing requirements.\n\nAnalysts at Sanford C. Bernstein lowered their price target to $180 from $210 on 1 September. On 2 September, Daiwa Capital Markets reduced its target to $133 from $215, downgrading the stock from outperform to neutral, while Needham & Company lowered its stock projection to $170 from $185.\n\nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank declined to provide a forecast until there are more details available, noting:\n\n\u201cAt a time when demand uncertainties are already rising across the semi sector, and rapidly expanding from Consumer markets to the Data Center, we expect these new trade restrictions to add additional investor angst regarding chip demand/growth prospects. We expect the impact on NVDA to be largest amongst the US processor companies, given the company\u2019s leadership position in HPC/AI.\u201d\n\nWhen evaluating any NVIDIA stock 5-year forecast, you should keep in mind that analysts\u2019 forecasts can be wrong. Forecasts shouldn\u2019t be used as a substitute for your own research. Always conduct your own due diligence before investing. And never invest or trade money you cannot afford to lose."

There's a big influx of cheaper used video cards, a decrease of miners, and no 4000 series yet.  It's really hard to say how it's going to ride out.  Right now, I'd expect this to drop farther.\n\nThe bigger negative is how low they may go with crypto cutting back.  Years ago, Nvidia was around a $2B to $3B revenue rate.  The crypto boom more than doubled that.  The biggest harm now is falling back down to that $3B level, halving their prime just a short bit ago.  They also cut dividends too which didn't help.\n\nI'd expect some rise from 4000 series release, but if their sales cut in half, I can't see the stock holding price, not even a \"low\" one of this peak time.

Not on the backend yet.  Tesla doing their own now for AI with the DOJO.   Amazon has started to do their own.  \n\nThis trend has barely even got started and should continue, IMHO.\n\nThe world has changed.  We now have these mega tech companies that have the resources to do their own chips instead of relying on others.\n\nI think the better investment is in the FAB providers and equipment for the FAB providers.  So companies like ASML and TSMC."

The p/e racio is crazy yes, but nvidia is the n1 on too many hot markets with tremendous room to grow, with no need to prove its business model or profitability.\n\nFB is mainly an add and social media company, a market that in my opinion is hard to know how much more can grow, the consumer mataverse is a dreamy proposition. Sure oculus will grow a lot. But thats not a trillion dollar business..ever..\n\nIn the end I would prefer having my money on nvidia, knowing it can fall 2/3 in a crisis, but be x10+ in 10-20 years in a business prespective."

     "On a fundamental level, FB should be good over the long term and is a better investment than Nvidia. However, on a more theoretical side there is a problem. \n\nAcross the world people are getting more serious about their privacy. Apple made some sweeping changes to privacy rules that weren\u2019t even particularly extensive and Facebook lost billions in revenue. Privacy laws in the EU and USA are slowly tightening, further squeezing potential ad profit there.\n\nFacebook has gambled wildly on the MetaVerse to sub par results. Active participation is a complete guess and AR or advanced VR is years away if it will ever exist at all. They could very well be pumping money into a pit. Even if AR and advanced VR do become available, what\u2019s to say it catches on? It\u2019s way more different than most things change wise. Bigger jump from cellphone to smartphone by a lot. This an inherent risk and the metaverse is also being developed as an online reflection of reality\u2026 not necessarily a good thing.\n\nThe use of Facebook itself is becoming less popular. While people do still use it, not enough do to justify any kind of growth. Instagram is the final piece, which is going strong for now. But is it reasonable to say eventually even instagram will phase out? It seems to be a long term trend with social media that the old dies and is replaced by the new innovative one.\n\nAll in all, I can justify a significant price increase in the short term, say 2-3 years. Beyond that, barring changes to their model as it is, they seem destined for a slow and agonizing death as they try to find a new way to innovate and continue to fail. In an even shorter term, price could be wild. Probably increases, but who knows really. Really long term, as in 5+ years, FB seems like a terrible buy. It\u2019s blue chip consistent slow growth is over and it is not a \u2018retirement stock\u2019."

They also aren't able to gather as much data about users due to the new iOS restrictions, and it isn't unlikely that Android may follow suit at some point. Because of the competition FB faces, I think it is causing investors to remember the social media platforms that once had a monopoly that FB dethroned. These platforms come and go in cycles. FB has alienated a lot of its users due to censorship, fact-checking, and the overall big brother feel with the constant COVID messaging anytime someone mentions COVID in their post. I personally don't appreciate the \"Take this survey about how you're feeling\" message that appears from FB at the top of my feed nearly every time I sign in even though I have dismissed it. My health is none of FB's business.\n\n NVDA is much more than self-driving and metaverse. They are also considered to be at the cutting edge of supercomputer development, self-driving and AI are a part of that. They are also the most common chip used for Crypto mining computers, which play an integral role in server farms (including cloud). I would suggest looking into NVDA further to get the explanation you are looking for. TSLA and NVDA trade at high forward P/E like most other tech companies. \n\nSince you mentioned TSLA, they are more than a car company. They also have an insurance and finance arm, and they are using tech developed for the cars and translating that to other future uses. There is also an unquantifiable gain to be had once self-driving and their robotaxi program goes online. I don't think self-driving is as far away as you think."

Maybe hard to accurately put a price tag on but it's certainly a very valuable brand.\n\nAlso there is so much demand for their products that you can't even get a hold of them.is it worth more than fb though, probably not right now, might be in 5-10 years though if fb starts losing market share and nvda keeps growing, remember the market is forward looking not backwards looking.  \n\n\nI do agree that the rally it went on in the fall was insane though, seems like fair value right now shouldn't really be above 200 but wtf do i know. I'm bullish on nvda as a company but the stock is trading at a premium."

I sold for $400, thought it was a smart trade. Then it went on the biggest rally ever, if I held it could have been 2000% to the peak, even with the TSLA sell-off it's still up 1000% from 2019.\n\nI took it as a lesson. \n\n\"Can't change the past. I'm never going to sell good performers again. How am I ever going to have life changing money by selling stocks before it could potentially become life changing?\"\n\nNow I'm holding NVDA which is up 600%+. While I understand very well that 963bn market cap makes the potential for future gains lower, I'm staying on the ride until the very end - after we see all the events unfold related to AI.\n\nI've already thought of the possible futures:\n\n1. AI is actually hype. NVDA goes down 50%. My life doesn't change - I go to work to pay bills.\n\n2. AI becomes a necessary tool for all of life, like smartphones. NVDA is the leading beneficiary. Life changing money - early retirement.\n\n3. Same as 2 but NVDA is not the leading beneficiary. Other companies \"win\" the AI war. Well I'm holding other tech stocks so should still be fine, and I'm staying up to date with company releases so hopefully I won't miss whatever companies \"win\". Already have companies like ASML, AMD, MSFT \n\nWhich I why 67% sell-offs don't bother me and why I don't take profits.\n\nIf stocks go down or profits are small - it doesn't change my life - I'm still working. \n\nOnly by holding these stocks all the way is there any life changing potential. \n\nHope that makes sense."

     "This literally happens to me all the time - especially when I ask my dad for advice. An example being Palantir which I had held since August 2022. As soon as I went back into profit by a couple percentage points a few weeks back my dad urged me to sell (which I did) even though I said it probably will go up by at least another 15% (which it has). So that was a stupid move and I lost out on a few hundred dollars of profit but oh well.\n\nThen, stupidly I bought AMD stock at $80 and sold at $91 a few weeks back whereas if I had held I would be up at least 40% but oh well that's life - at least I made a profit.\n\nThe truth is we are all very bad at timing the market and the lesson I NEVER seem to learn is just HOLD long term instead of short term trading. I have probably made over \u00a310k ($12.3k in USD) in short term trading however if I had kept the majority of my stocks it no doubt would be a lot higher. This is one of the reasons I'm moving away from individual stocks and holding ETFs in a brokerage account (Vanguard) that isn't so impulsive to sell and holding long term for instance an ETF which tracks the S&P 500. I'm from the UK btw so mainly invest in VUSA now although I do also dabble in individual shares but that now takes up a much smaller percentage of my Net Worth. One good example of my market timing was selling AMD back in 2021 near its all time highs although that is a rare example of successfully timing the market (most of mine are failures of timing the market)."

The art is trying to sell at the peak, and for that you have to be patient.\n\nBut be scared when everyone is excited about the stock, and be greedy when everyone is disgusted with it.\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/price-sales](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/price-sales)\n\nThis is the old price to sales chart for Nvidia. In October 2022, it was 12. It dropped there from a high high of 26 in October of 2021. Chart shows currently 35. This stock is FOMOing, and selling out is not a terrible idea. Generally you want to wait for that price to sales to crest and flatten, maybe even wait for a little crash to confirm it has crested.\n\nYou could say you sold too early. Just like the saying \"Don't catch a falling knife.\" It works in the other direction too. You want to wait for a bottom before you buy. You want to wait for a top before you sell. Easier said than done though. You made money, so good on you!\n\nIt can go higher than this. Money is rushing into anything AI right now, as the rest of the market languishes in reality. But I mean, you are paying $35 for $1 of revenue. This company has to grow at a monster pace for a long time to justify the current price. This is assuming AMD and others can't compete with AI chip designs, and I think that is a bad assumption. Good company, really pricey right now. Probably will go higher, but I am not getting in at this point, if that makes you feel any better. I don't much like timing momentum plays, which is what this has become. Good company, but weird time for the stock.\n\nSo keep in mind that this batch of AI is not AGI, and not even close. This is going to be more like the revolution we had with Google search, where encyclopedias went to die. There will be changes. This isn't the singularity.\n\nFind good companies. Buy and hold until there is a real reason to sell. Understand that the whole AI space is a good place to make or lose a lot of money quickly. Invest in a way that lets you sleep at night.\n\nGood luck to you!"

The back side of almost all big moves on securities or ETF\u2019s are proceeded by day over day falling volume AND price dropping more than before the last run up.  When you see this, it\u2019s almost always a sure sign that institutions want you to sell and are attempting to drive price in a manor in which you become emotional about your trade.\n\nWhile the volume was dropping on 5/19-5/23, the price closed down 3.1% vs. just prior to the run up (5/8-5/12) it was down 2.8%.  This is an increasing price failure on a run up.  Had volume been increasing and price moving down (less than 2.8%), this would have been your queue to exit.\n\nVolume and price analysis dictates with falling volume and falling price, the next move should be bullish.  The closing candle on 5/24 was a hammer.  All the signs were there, but you were tricked into selling early due to the SPF.\n\nThe key answer to your question is that feelings have no place in the market\u2026you don\u2019t cope with anything, you learn and you move on and get better.  Congrats on what you did make!"

They continue to diversify their revenue streams and have been delivering well on that too. \n\nPoint is, no one here can tell you how the stock will perform in the short term so if you\u2019ve high conviction, you can buy tiny recurring amounts to bring that $300 avg down.

     "No matter how great a company is, fundamentals matter and valuation matters. Paying an obscene valuation and basically banking on the company staying as ridiculously overvalued as it performs is a dangerous game, one that way too many people are playing. You know, you don't see FB, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT trading at PEs of 50, 60, 80, 100, even though they are brilliant companies.\n\nAs a company performs, it eventually matures. Naturally the P/E and other valuation metrics will come down and reflect that. Paying a P/E of 100 is basically saying \"Yeah, I expect this company to grow 30, 35, 40%, and not just for one year but for years and years and years to come. Tell me, how realistic is that for NVDA? What were your expectations when buying it at a market cap of 700 or 800 billion dollar? That this was gonna be a 2T company in 5 years?\n\nAnd, again, value moderation. Let's say NVDA starts slowing down and people expect them to grow 15 to 20% annually (which is still stellar growth for a company this size of course). Eventually that will factor into the P/E and the people might only be willing to pay a 30 P/E (note that this is obviously very superficial since I'm only using P/E to illustrate). With the expected earnings for NVDA, that would amount to a share price of roughly 195 to 225 bucks in 2025/2026.\n\nIf nothing else, I think that show to some extent that valuation matters even for brilliant companies that are here to stay and grow. Even at the absolute high end for analyst estimates that sort of P/E moderation, which would, in my opinion, be fair, the share price would be expected to be around around 260 to 270 in 2025/2026. So that would still amount to a -10% in 4-5 years if you bought at 300 and held on. Not a great performance, even though the company would be performing very well in that time."

In a way they are, and certainly the PEs paint them as such, but if it were as simple as selling stocks above a certain PE and buying stocks below a certain PE we would all be rich.\n\nDo your own research, but I like AMD's prospects the most out of the three. I think it's a matter of when, not if, Congress passes a big, fat stimulus package for chip makers like INTC and AMD. AMD's recent acquisition of Pensando makes them more competitive with Intel, which makes more than just CPUs. Intel also makes WiFi/Bluetooth modules, SSDs, I think a few other things, though I believe they gave up on the cellular modems. Dr. Su pulled off an outstanding recovery when AMD was on the brink of bankruptcy circa 2016 and I have confidence that she is choosing acquisitions very carefully and purposefully. \n\nApple has slowing iPhone sales to contend with. Their M1 SoC is neato but I am selling my M1 MacBook and buying a Surface Pro 8. Still too many growing pains for more than YouTube and Office. A lot of software engineers/companies that hire software engineers are buying up the more expensive ($2-4k) MacBook Pros, but I think it's a little early to make the jump to ARM from x86. It's like electric cars... are they the future? Yes. Does that mean there's no demand for ICE cars? No. \n\nI think it's musical chairs for all three, and it's just about not being the one holding the bag when the music stops. That said, I think AMD has steam left.\n\nYou might look at Dell. It only has a PE of 4 but obviously AMD's good fortune is Dell's good fortune and vice-versa. Analysts can shit on it all they like, but I love their laptops, monitors and PowerEdge servers."

Apple on the other hand has increased your ownership of the company by 25% over the past 5 years due to share buy backs.  Personally I would wait for Apple to hit $150/share again before buying more, but I would consider dropping NVDA and AMD for Intel.  Intel has the profit that AMD and NVDA wish they had, has an average of 8% revenue growth YoY over the last 10 years, and has issued share buybacks during the process.  \n\n\nHowever, if I had to pick between NVDA and AMD and which will net me a better return I would pick AMD.  The massive market cap of NVDA makes it hard for them to continue growing.  Also, AMD has initiated a share buyback program and is therefore beginning to offset the dilution that they caused over the past 2 years."

     "NVDA has some nice AI in house but it doesn\u2019t compare to SOTA research put out by Google/Deepmind, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Others. What NVIDA has going for it is that it it\u2019s the furthest along in GPUs for deep learning/ML training, currently maintaining its lead through pushing more power/wattage with ridiculously huge cards/racks. Their GPUs are becoming less efficient, but they have to find ways to push the envelop with the diminishing returns from smaller lithography nodes. Thus far, NVIDIA GPUs are the engine of choice for training ML models and have even brushed off challengers like Graphcore. But it\u2019s uncertain how long they\u2019ll maintain that lead given the compute wall we\u2019re facing. At that point, it\u2019ll become a more commoditized play, and my guess is 10-15 years from now Chinese semiconductor challengers will rival NVDA in $/compute. NVDA sees this reality, and you can tell from their last GTC summit they\u2019re looking to become more of a software services company to differentiate and maintain a locked in customer base as Microsoft, AWS have with cloud. \n\nI think there\u2019s a chance NVDA could innovate into new segments, but they\u2019ll have to go beyond consumer gaming GPUs, automotive, and data center HPC to remain on top when the performance gains shrink. I had money on NVDIA when the ARM acquisition was in play, and would bet more on ARM\u2019s future (despite their current sales). They seem more chiefly focused in creating efficient designs, optimized ML a workloads; and semiconductor markets are heading that way. \n\nAI is for sure here to stay, but the future is more in which AI startups can create the world\u2019s best domain-specific model. OpenAI, Google, MSFT, others have created these absurdly large pretrained models that are similarly encountering diminishing returns from brute-forcing more compute/data; but it\u2019s a race to the bottom amongst big tech in licensing those models to other smaller companies fine-tuning the big models for specific applications. \n\nThat said, just looking at the volume of AI papers and novel applications of SOTA models, my money would be on Google if we\u2019re to expand the timeline to 10-15 years. NVIDIA for sure has a great future for the next 5, but I\u2019m unsure about the next 10."

They have a myriad of high potential projects, along with self driving cars (Waymo), Android (the world's most common phone OS) and a growing hardware offering.

Cloud is growing at a breakneck pace, like 30% YoY. Azure will be the engine of growth, while M365 is the cash cow and gaming + surface are the fun consumer growth areas. \n\nNvidia is amazingly well positioned to be the shovel sellers in the new gold rush. In addition to their most important business of data centers & next gen AI, their GPUs are incredibly in demand. The gaming interest isn't going away, along with crypto mining. And as they continue to be market leaders with new chips in the 4000 series demand will continue to flourish. But!

     "If 1000 is your whole portfolio Put it all in SPHD it\u2019s a low cost ETF, with about a %4 dividend. Make sure to turn on dividend reinvesting. I also recommend dollar cost averaging, so buy maybe $100 a day for 10 days. While NVDA and Microsoft will likely continue to grow, they\u2019re value has increased sharply. You could YOLO it, and in that case, the best thing you could do is put it all in Litecoin and hold until you\u2019re ready to retire. Companies can always issue more stock, there will never be more Bitcoin/Litecoin once it is all mined. At 21, you need to open a Roth IRA (td Ameritrade is what I use, totally free) to buy these stocks in, you can take out the money you put in, but not the profit. and divide your stocks up into sections, growth (mid cap/large cap tech) and dividend. \n\nAGNC NNN O all pay high dividends (REITs) that I recommend buying. \n\nAs far as NVDA v MSFT, NVDA is effected pretty bad by the chip shortage, but has also gone up a lot.\n\nLooking forward, I think Apple is set up to do the best, and tends to go up over time historically. \n\nAs a reminder, stocks typically go down not long after you buy them. Don\u2019t sell. \n\nIf you\u2019re trying to do a yolo, I\u2019d say Apple call options. If you\u2019re starting retirement savings, make sure to do it in a Roth IRA and diversify. 1/5th APPL 1/5th MSFT 1/5th AGNC 1/5th SPHD 1/5th NVDA (if you\u2019re really bullish on them). Everyone needs some Deflationary assets (like Litecoin/Bitcoin) since their supply is limited, but to someone who is just starting out a long term portfolio the above mentioned layout is a great start. But tbh, you can literally just put all of it into SPHD or SPYD, earn dividends and probably beat most anything you tried to put together yourself, and being as young as you are, short term price fluctuations won\u2019t matter in the long term, especially with dividend stocks. So while NVDA and MSFT are both excellent companies, you are putting all of your eggs into one or two baskets, and investor sentiment tides could change, say if there was a Secuirty breach or recall or dividend reduction. You could also research out some small caps, but for your first $1000 I\u2019d say SPYD or SPHD or even all Apple. Those dividends will feel good when the price is lower. Try and always max out your Roth IRA. 6k a year, and wait to buy on red days. Two riskier plays that pay dividends are Lumen (centrylink) and T (ATT) that are both cheap right now. My .02"

     "AMD was one of the easiest convictions I've ever had.\n\nI remember back in 2012 when I was building my first crypto mining rig and I purchased some AMD graphics cards, 2nd hand. Reason why I bought 2nd hand was because there was no stock anywhere.\n\n5 months later, with the crypto rig fully paid for by the increase in prices of cryptos. I decided to sell my cards. When I checked the market, my cards that have been running overclocked and undervolted 24/7 for 8 months had appreciated in value. I sold them for more than I paid for. Some weren't even working anymore, but the person who bought off me was fine with it as they could still RMA it under warranty. The cards were so out of stock and everyone wanted to get into the hype of mining for crypto. Still is the same today. You still can't get newly released graphics cards because of miners..\n\nAMD also makes processors but back then, Intel was clearly winning. But these two companies always take turns to be the dominant chip maker, it was just Intel's turn but today, it is AMD turn to be the dominant player. It will switch again next cycle. \n\nOh.. and AMD also have a monopoly over the console markets. Both Xbox and PlayStation run on AMD chips. And back then, we already knew the new gen consoles will continue running on AMD chips. How was that not priced in, I don't truly know..\n\n\nThe price for AMD was like what? $2 usd a share in November 2012? 2 bucks a share!! The shorts are idiots.. How can a company with full monopoly over console chips and crypto mining, collapse? When they shorted AMD stock to $2, they were betting against console gamers and crypto. Idiots..\n\nHow did people not see an inevitable price rise coming, I don't quite know.\n\n\nThis is the same conviction I have for PLTR. Everyone continues to bash this stock and laugh at it but I see a company that has virtually no competition and is absolutely essential. AI combined with data analytics is THE future of our society. \n\nThere's no two ways about it and PLTR is the sole company that already has a working product in this field. The closest competitors are decades behind in development.\n\nI also think there are some commodities that are underpriced.  Namely coal as people will realise that renewables isnt sufficient to maintain energy demand and the pent up demand is about to swing back in coal favour. \n\nLithium is also going up still as more and more batteries are required to build EVs. If Tesla is going to the moon, then so is lithium stocks."

If another tech group like Google or Microsoft wanted to start making chips they'd buy out AMD so it was simple. The company turns it around with market capture or get bought out. Win-win.

Saw that if they could scale production, get the software side at least halfway decent, and got other companies to take them seriously by designing software to utilize their architecture efficiently that they could steal huge market share like they did back in the Athlon days. There were also issues Intel was dealing with like the kernel security issues in the way Intel CPUs execute tasks. Other things have reinforced my conviction like market share gains in both CPU and server segments.\n\nAll of that together gave me enough conviction to start a position and have been adding periodically since.

Not \u201cwould I buy\u201d but do I already use them in my life, or have in recent times. \n\nAnd two, how are they valued relative to competitors. \n\nBased on that, if a company I can trust and I believe offers a superior product is valued lower than their next biggest competitor, then it only makes sense that they would eventually grow past their competitor. \n\nAnd of course this isn\u2019t a perfect strategy, but it\u2019s one I\u2019ve found a ton of success with, and it\u2019s very similar to Buffet\u2019s strategy.

     "Amd and nvda are everywhere. If you ever thought about buying computer parts these are two of the main companies. Anytime you see a product constantly and spoken about positively you should check out the public company associated.    \n\nThe only issue is replicating that now is impossibly hard with how many retail investors exist and how quick people are to buy up stocks. At the time when I bought AMD it was $12. Sat on that stock for 4 years to go to $55 and 2 more years to hit what it is now. It\u2019s a slow grow and was a ticket that was frustrating to see beat earnings and still not gap up. Now look at these past earnings everything is 8% up or down. IV is never sub 40% for anything. \n\nThe only other stock that I can think of that I knew would be a sure fire winner long term was Tesla and it\u2019s not because I\u2019m a fanboy but because of how much word of mouth and product growth you saw of this company combined with how crazy the leadership was for this company. If you live in a liberal city or basically the main two New York and San Fran you saw first hand how many Of these cars month after month pop up.    \n\nIf I was to look for something like this again my bet would be a fast casual looking to grow nationally with strong infrastructure in real estate, online sales, and employee recruitment."

     "In case of AMD, it was easy for me to understand.\n\nBasically you had Intel, that was an actual monopoly without being a monopoly, telling everybody how they should work, regardless of clients needs, and charging a hefty amount of money for meager gains in CPU alone, without mentioning other expenses for arming a decent PC with pricy motherboards and heatsinks.\n\nThen you had clients (above average IT literacy and beyond), that understood their programs and workloads, that would sacrifice overall cpu speed, in favor of a less speedy CPU but capable of handling more work in parallel a more efficient manner, that was even cheaper than their available counterparts, and promised to maintain the same platform a couple of years even when their CPUs have been improved.   \n\n\nThen the rest was history, AMD improved their CPU, making it run faster, improved their CPU work in parallel, made its CPU do more with less, and even run at a lower temperature, while Intel until now, is basically pushing CPU at a higher frequency, and running a lot hotter with every iteration, with minor improvements to CPU design.  \n\n\nThen came the blows of security concerns, the last few years, patching security flows in Intel CPU had a high penalty to Intel CPUs, while AMD had a lot fewer, and with a lot lower penalty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe few advantages that Intel has over AMD are:  \n1. Intel have their own silicon foundries.\n\n2. Intel have a big check book, with a big account, and loads of money."

But both individuals and businesses will have to pay whatever price is set because GPUs and CPUs are going to continue to be integrated into every facet of life IoT related. Then with the metaverse being the new hotness just increases the need for GPUs. Not to mention crypto mining.

Huge moat having all components.\n-\tGraphics where they\u2019re by far leading innovators in rendering (RT/PT, DLSS, etc.)\n-\tOmniverse/multiverse initiatives for simulation and design work.\n-\tAutonomous vehicles with MB and JLR as committed customers for their full solution (chips and software). And they\u2019re partners with so many startups.\n-\t5G/Cellular initiatives (don\u2019t know much about this).\n-\tJetson for AI and robotics.\n\nI see people comparing them to AMD and other chip makers, usually looking at their consumer graphics cards and saying how similar they are. But the reality is that it\u2019s not even close. Nvidia isn\u2019t a chip company. They\u2019re far beyond that now. All of this info is in their quarterly summaries and GTC presentations.\n\nWith their CEO (who is also a cofounder, always a good thing) and their large array of high-growth fields that they\u2019re investing in, I have high confidence that this company is going to keep growing for several years to come."

     "I worry long term for the independent chip makers.  I think you will see the chips more and more come from the big guys like Google and Amazon.\n\nApple already makes their own chips.\n\nI think that is the future.   The market has completely changed because of cloud and smartphones for chips.\n\nIt use to be that Dell bought chips from Intel and sold their servers to zillions of different companies.\n\nBut that is not longer how things are. Today companies are not buying their own servers but instead buying the service from Google, Amazon or Microsoft.     Since it is concentrated it makes sense for these companies to create their own chips.\n\nGoogle for example has already done this with AI.   Google has now created four generations of TPUs and will continue to develop their own chips.  Google is now doing their own smartphone chip and would expect that to just grow to more areas.\n\nAmazon is doing their own chips for their cloud.   Microsoft is the lagger in this area but would expect them to do the same.\n\nYou will see the same thing happen with self driving.  It is already happening with Google/Waymo.    Waymo uses Google silicon for all the training.   Which is where the money is at.  But I would expect we will also see Google silicon used for inference in the cars.\n\nTesla is another example of the same thing.  They do their own silicon instead of using a third party.     These are the two leaders in self driving.  Waymo with robot taxi and Tesla with cars you buy and neither is going to use Nvidia long term.   Tesla is today using Nvidia for the training aspect.   With Cruise deciding on using the Google Cloud I would expect their training also to go to Google silicon.\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/how-cruise-tests-its-avs-on-a-google-cloud-platform"

     "Its a great company, but it is still expensive. \n\nLet's assume a 15% growth rate for 10 years. That would be very generous given the cyclicality of the semi-conductor market, but lets roll with it. The company currently has 3,91$ EPS TTM and paid 0,16$ in dividends. Assuming a 20% dividend growth rate for the 10 years and 20 PE in Year 10 -  the price would be 124.63$ if we want 10% return. \n\nIf you want more or a margin of safety (which should be required for a cyclical industry) or the earnings growth slows just a little, 124.63$ would be too high. \n\nI think that given the current climate, a good margin of safety is required (especially as with 4-5% inflation you lose a lot of real returns). So for 70$ a share, I think I might buy Nvidia if nothing on the growth and earnings side changes."

What are AMD's future prospects? Is it possible that, in 20 years, AMD could have a year with a revenue growth rate of 30% (not saying 30% CAGR for the next 20 years - just wondering if it has the business model to be able to pull off impressive growth at any given point of time in the future)? NVDA has a higher multiple right now so the market obviously thinks it has better future prospects. What are you thoughts on that?\"",

     "NVDA - makes GPUs and has AI platforms. Their chips have seen gaming and crypto-mining tailwinds. It is the GPU leader, bar none. Most compellingly, its chips are used in data centers which is the most attractive part of the semiconductor side of its portfolio.\n\nAMD - makes processors for computers like Intel but its absolutely destroying Intel and eating that company's market share, which makes it a big winner. It also makes GPUs like NVDA, but they're not market-leading. It's chips are also used in data centers, which has seen explosive growth.\n\nPersonally, I think both stocks look expensive. I can't pretend to understand where NVDA sits in the AI development world, so I stay away because the semiconductor side seems a bit overpriced especially as we hear gaming companies come out with less-than-stellar quarters and the recent crypto crash. I'd buy this stock for the data center story and AI story, but at lower multiples.\n\nAMD is more reasonably valued and is probably near fair value since it is such a share-taker in its space. \n\nI believe there are better chip stocks out there than these two, especially given their higher multiples, that being said there is no doubt these are best-in-breed chipmakers and companies, and I wouldn't argue passionately that you wouldn't see returns even investing at these levels but given their strong outperformance recently I personally would wait for a price correction for jumping in."

     "I've been buying Nvidia pretty consistently from 2020 till end of 2022.  I haven't bought more this year.  I view it as 10 year investment horizon, and I didn't really care what financials looked like.  I believe in the [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://www.diamandis.com/blog/5-stages-of-the-hype-cycle) idea.  During that time period, I also worked for a VC growth accelerator program; so I'm biased to ideas that I've seen pitched.  But the new markets created that benefits Nvidia:\n\n* Generative AI (current hype wave), AND I also think there will 'Models-As-A-Service' that will likely emerge that will disrupt current SAAS businesses (future hype train)\n* Metaverse (current Trough of Disillusion).  As generative AI gets easier and better (art then video then 3D objects); then Metaverse can happen.  It's no secret even way back then, that Apple was also looking into the space.\n* Crypto-Blockchain -  (current Trough of Disillusion); another big bull run will eventually happen within the next 10 years.\n* Zero-Knowledge Proofs - I think ZK will trigger a big hype train with inflated expectations.  And my intuition is that Nvidia also benefits from this.\n* Cloud-Gaming - -  (current Trough of Disillusion); Google Stadia died, but somebody is going to try again and will eventually get it right.\n* Nvidia software R&D (tech trigger) -  Their R&D have been amazing the last few years; There's potential they commercializes those efforts and those would be big businesses also.    \n\nI don't think it's 1 of those 6 things happens, I think it's likely that at least 4 of 6 of those things will be really important by 2030; and it's just impossible to gauge what type of revenues will look for Nvidia when it does happen."

The more we get hung up on questioning the rationality of the market, the more we miss opportunities. History shows again and again, long-term market leaders had inflated valuations *before* they made their big runs."

     "This hypothetical timer is an idiot. The issue with NVDA was that they had a huge pull forward of demand, coupled with a historically high valuation and historically high margins. This kind of set up was obviously not sustainable.\n\nSelling after that has played out in the price action of the stock obviously not going to work. You have to take a risk and sell while things are ridiculously good, or if you're good, when things look like they're just about to turn.\n\nThe key to buying NVDA now is anticipating when news might get better and buying before that happens. My guess is that you still have at least another quarter or two of bad news given the macro. That means you probably have some time yet and the valuation is still very high. So just wait. There's no rush to buy a stock that's priced to perfection imo. There's always going to be other times you can buy NVDA at an excessive valuation if that's how you like to play things."

They need to get their shit together and make good quality games that, yes, can have microtransactions, but shouldn't be overly greedy altogether. Like Overwatch 2 selling skins for almost $20... for a single skin.\n\n\nAnd if the acquisition goes through, SONY should bring back Socom but modernize it a bit. Many people will buy it off the bat for nostalgia alone. Hell, even remaster 1 & 2."

So there is this whole forward PE lie. The PE is actually much higher with the lower guidance. They do this to rationalize that Q3 and Q4 companies can make it up. Also the excuse gives their investment banks cover to unload saying forward PE lie is low. When Q3 earnings can\u2019t make up the difference then will come the bloodbath.\n\nSo just beware all scams\u2026 but recession like is never priced in until it actually happens"

I primarily invest by DCA into ETFs like SPY, QQQ and DIA. I've also decided to branch out by nibbling on individual stocks within the QQQ. I find NVDA interesting and hold a small position from when it was $226/share, I think it has a good business model, a good history of profitability and it has an edge over other chipmakers in the sense that they're the best at graphics technology.\\n\\nHowever, I can't understand why people continue buying into NVDA stock at current values where the PE is 95+ NVDA has the potential to grow no doubt, but does it really have the potential to grow at a rate that justifies such a rich valuation today? Or is it just that traders/WSB types are playing games with the stock?\\n\\nWouldn't a better investment be to look elsewhere in the semiconductor industry for better deals?

     "Companies that have high R&D spend with high profit margins almost always have high or even negative p/e values. Good examples are **NVDA, AMD, NET, ROKU** etc. All businesses with profit margins of 60% or more and high R&D spend. \n\nDue to their high profit margins they can scale and grow earnings faster than other businesses. A business with 70% profit margins that grows revenues by 10% is growing earnings 350% faster than a business with the same revenue but only a 20% profit margin.\n\nProfit margins are basically a multiplier on earnings growth. \n\n**MSFT** is a good example of a maturing company that has been streamlining their SG&A and R&D spend. From 2018-2021 their revenues increased by 52.5% (18% growth/year), but their EBITDA increased by 80.2% and their EPS by a whopping 377%. \n\nAs a result, despite having a PE of over 45 in 2018, their PE in 2021 is 37 despite the stock going up by 300% over that time span. \n\nImagine seeing a stock triple in price in 3 years and actually becoming **cheaper** in terms of PE ratio. That's what a maturing growth company does. This is why investors go gaga over companies that grow revenue by 40%+ a year with 60%+ profit margins (which is double what MSFT did over that time span)."

Right now, Nvidia is top dog in both hardware and software. However, Intel and AMD are coming for them. MI200 was a big step forward for AMD on the hardware end. They're not even close in terms of software, but neither Intel nor AMD are sleeping around.\n\nWe're going to see very soon what foundation Intel has built in terms of graphics when Alchemist launches and they start getting more deeply involved on that end. Newer technologies like XeSS are skewing towards open source. Intel and AMD are expanding their AI efforts significantly. \n\nPeople who think that Nvidia's lead is insurmountable should also remember that AMD went from a \\~$2 billion company facing bankruptcy to a now $170+ billion company with leading edge CPU/GPU performance. As a long time member of the tech community, I remember the days when people said Intel was so far ahead that no other chip designer or fab could catch them. Now look where we are with TSMC and AMD. This used to be unthinkable.\n\nThe semiconductor industry right now is more fiercely competitive than ever and Intel is finally awake. Nobody knows who will be on top and no lead is insurmountable. It's effectively going to be an Nvidia, AMD, and Intel free for all in the next few years with everybody using TSMC's nodes."

Price rises quickly.\n\nOthers see the price rise, know the positive things around the company, and FOMO kicks in.  Price gets driven higher.\n\nCurrent price is way, way beyond what is currently reasonable, and is deep into speculation territory.  This is common with growth stocks, though is unusual for a more mature company like Nvidia.  The really high P/E (and forward P/E) shows just how much the current price is speculation about future growth, and so there is risk.  If Nvidia keeps growing but that growth slows, the stock price could come tumbling down rapidly.  Doesn't mean they are bad or failing--just that the price has gotten ahead of itself.\n\nSame thing happened with so many of the COVID stocks--they are still growing, growth slowed down, share price took a nosedive because they were priced for continued explosive growth.  So I would be very, very careful buying Nvidia.  At this price it is more like gambling than investing.  I think they have a great future and would happily buy...at more like half the current price.

You have a vacuum they have created what they did was they sucked all the liquidity that exists and they gave them one viable option to make money... STOCKS.. then they printed money and benefited STOCKS.... see the trend? STOCKS its been all about STOCKS for 2 years now but this is why major players are not predicting a crash or correction because once that vaccuum seal breaks... and liquidity gets sucked back out via higher interest rates or whatever triggers it... surely some retail that joined this investing game recently are going to lose a lot of money. Hedge funds have good entry points on stock long before most retailers do so their price to lose much is much lower lot of them got in the major players 10+ years ago so if a correction happens they could care less its retail that will feel the wrath aka the lower/middle class folks usually."

If its earnings were to grow such that its PE at an $800B valuation today matched Apple's, it would be making about 1/3 the profit of Apple.  Is it realistic that the average first world (essentially) person will be providing the same annual profit to Nvidia as Apple? \n\nI'm not saying their direct customer bases are the same, they certainly are not.  But Apple's reach and pricing power is enormous.  Ultimately every dollar in revenue a company gets comes from consumers.  If your customers are companies then your revenue from them is a small slice of the revenue they get from their customers, and so on.\n\nI don't see a scenario where Nvidia reaches Apple's level of profits or even 1/3 of it in the next decade.  \n\nI find comparisons like this useful for trying to estimate the potential profitability for a company.   You could make the best widget or service ever but it has to fit in everyone's budget, possibly displacing something else, to make a ton of money from it.  I think at every late stage bull market most people just aren't considering this at all so valuations get insane.  10 to 15 years later, a few companies will have grown into those valuations, but most won't."

     "Not surprisingly, no one here really answered your question.\n\nRegardless of the ticker, when a stock has a high valuation based on todays numbers(pe, trailing pe, trailing eps, trailing fcf, trailing p/revenue etc), one has to look at forward projections.  \n\nBasically the stock is priced high because investors feel its future value metrics will come into a reasonable valuation even with a market outperforming stock price appreciation. \n\nFor example, let's say the SP is expected to average 8% annual returns for the next 5 years. The only reason to buy an individual stock is if an investor expects it to return enough *more* than the benchmark to offset the higher risk of an individual stock holding. So, for me, id need to expect a stock to return 12% for 5 years to justify owning it over an ETF of the benchmark. \n\nSo, to evaluate of the stock we are looking at is worth the asking price, im going to look at all those value metrics on a forward basis and compare them to the benchmarks forward value metrics. Those forward value metrics are educated guesses, guided by the companies own statements, sec filings and expectations of market analysts. Then, id have to apply my knowledge of the companies sector, to determine where *I* think those metrics will be in relation to the established ones. \n\nIt's not an easy process, and in reality though they won't admit it, most individual investors are just looking at charts, a few numbers and making a gut decision. When they are right they feel like they are smart, when wrong, they feel like they were unlucky. Neither of which is true, but that's why most people invest in indexes, because trying to get enough knowledge and information about enough individual stocks to form a semi diversified portfolio requires a lot of time and effort. Time and effort have value. Let's say you spend 2 hours a week doing all that work for an 8 stock portfolio AND you are one of the few people who manages to beat the index, take that 2 hours a week, value it at $15 bucks an hour doing some job and investing that 30$ a week extra into an etf, and chances are that outperformance evaporated."

Combine that with a relatively low IV (at least when I checked it about month when I purchased a LEAP) plus the fact that recent stock splits seem to rally immediately following the split and then tank for some time after ( think AAPL & TSLA) and I think AMD is the clear winner here."

Out of the blue he called me bawling on New Year's Eve 1999 that the boss (\"who has been like a father to me\") shit canned him and a few of his close-knit team.  Forced them to cash out all their stock holdings with the company after years of getting huge stock bonuses.  Good sized severance package (paid cash for a house in Boston).   But he was just devastated that he was going to be robbed of all the future money those stocks were going to generate.   \nWhen he got home, there was a recording on his answering machine from his bosses' wife Deanna to call a guy out in Boston for a job- I think it started around $200K at the time and was paying $400K when he moved on a couple years back.   \nOh, the punchline was 6 months after he was let go, Inacom filed bankruptcy and the remaining employees didn't get dick."

But with AI it is very easy to see how it can be useful, even if it\u2019s not perfect right now. There are issues I have today that Chatgpt can help with (coding, summarizing subjects). People shouldn\u2019t be using them in a court of law, and companies shouldn\u2019t be thinking they can already replace most employees, but it is not hard to see that one day it might be possible.\nWithin the next ten years I think it\u2019s very possible that we see a decline in the rate of growth of certain jobs because of LLMs making good employees even more productive."

At the high end for legal cases like the one you cite, it\u2019s buggy and years/decades away from being reliable. Mainly because it\u2019s freeware that doesn\u2019t have optimized access to company workflows.\n\nI agree AI is being touted far too often as a magic wand, similar to other bubbles.

Meaning more processing power, smarter AI, and likely Microsoft involvement (backend support) due to their hefty investment.\n\nAI is definitely going to be the future.

Doesn't matter who's making chips, ASML will be a beneficiary.\n\nI like INTC because it's reasonably priced unlike some of the other semiconductor names and I think their foundry expansion plan is the right move and will likely succeed given they now have a respected engineer leading the company and that it's success has become an issue of national security. I get why people a nervous about owning INTC, but I think the rewards with INTC far outweigh the risks.\n\nNVDA is extremely expensive and I hate owning it for that reason, but it's a great company and gives me exposure to a lot of stuff I like. AI, crpyto, gaming, data-centres, etc. They have a great CEO and loads of growth tailwinds. Even if it struggles because of its valuation short-term it's hard to see NVDA being a bad company to own long-term."

I doubt how successful Intel will be in establishing themselves as a foundry but at the same time doubt how capable other companies are of advancing their abilities beyond a point where Intel doesn't have any technological advance over them.\r  \n\r  \nI think AMD and NVDA will need to invest more in their partnership with TSMC to stay relevant in the sense of deploying the latest technologies while Samsung is falling behind. So in other words the real battle will be between TSMC and Intel, where TSMC currently has a slight advantage but their execution needs to be perfect to expand it."

     "I think I'm the reason this happened, my story isn't unique.  In 2012 I went to the car store and bought a brand new Fiat 500, with 0% interest.  I drove that car for 10 years and put 120K + on it.   It worked out to $289 a month for the loan.  The only thing I ever did was change the oil like 10 times, replace the starter, and replaced the battery maybe twice.  The clutch stared going out a few months ago, but replacing it was tricky and the labor exceeded the value of the car, basically making it scrap.  I never bought any parts for it at auto parts stores.\n\nAt the same time I have a 1991 Chevy van.  The odometer was broken when I bought it 20 years ago.  I'm on my second transmission/ going on my 3rd engine.  Other than the two major assemblies, I haven't bought parts for it either\n\nI guess things last a long time, and if labor is expensive, the car gets scraped and you can go get a new one, unless it's a Chevy van, then just get a new motor or whatever and bolt it in, except you probably don't want yr new motor from Auto Zone, which is why stock is down."

  "Text": "b'Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that dont know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!\\n\\nDuring the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in th'",

I guess we have to take profits once in a while right?\\n\\nAnyways I feel the market is so stretched right now so I don't feel bad adding to my cash for if we have a correction!\\n\\nJust wanted to say Nvidia is one of my favorite investments and companies besides MSFT AAPL and stuff.\\n\\nI'm still officially up 101%.

We've had the \"recipe\" for deep learning since like the 50s.\n\nSimilarly, LLMs aren't really all that different from deep learning and the idea has been \"around\" for a while. The most impactful breakthrough was the discovery of something called \"attention\" and \"transformers\" but this is really just an interation in the something called a recurrent neural network, which again is something that's been around since the 1970s.

Google put up over 3 times the growth rate of Apple!!\n\nout of all the FANGs you have Google growing by far the fastest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow.\n\nGoogle still has tons of assets that the have yet to monetize or fully monetized.\n\nTake Android. Over a billion devices activated per year and Google does not charge a cent. They could do a nominal license fee of $10 and add over $10 billion of revenue which really would be profit as it would not add any new expense.\n\nBut Android is just one example. Google has so many others which just make a massive runway for Google. So if growth starts to slow Google has plenty of levers to pull to keep it going for a very long time. Plus Google keeps adding new ones.\n\nPeople forget that Google is half the age of Microsoft and Apple. It is only a matter of time until Google passes Apple. They already blew past Microsoft. Google has more revenue and makes a lot more than Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook or Netflix. FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\n\nGoogle is also going to do a 20:1 stock split which means they can now join the DJIA. Probably replacing IBM but it could be CSCO (Cisco). That will also give an additional strong tailwind.\n\nBut the other thing really going for Google is the financial engineering. Google bought back over $50 billion in their own shares in 2021. That means less outstanding shares which then just increases EPS as there are less shares.\n\nGoogle had over $65 billion in free cash flow in 2021. They also have over $140 billion in cash just doing basically nothing. Google could really increase their buyback and that significantly decreases shares. So share price appreciations with Google basically doing nothing. Why they call it financial engineering.\n\nBTW, in the past people would say there is this law of large numbers. Which was such a croc. It was the reason given for Apple growth slowing. Well Google has finally put that to rest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow. They are now an over $250 billion dollar business. Will be well over $300 billion next year.\n\nI am old but I have never seen a more amazing company. The fastest in history to get to 1 trillion market cap. Then the fastest to $2 trillion. Amazon is actually three years older than Google and why the records are with Google.\n\nPeople think Google genius is with their technology. But actually the most genius thing they did was using the dutch auction for search. That was just brilliant. It will also help them with the government as Google does not set price."

So...\n\nTarget 1: A reversion back to the 12-month moving average, which would bring it down to the $215-$225 area. However, it would still be overpriced at that level so...\n\nTarget 2: On a valuation perspective, a more reasonable P/S of 15 (which some might say is still too high) would bring it all the way down to around $150. What's notable about this level is that it also corresponds with the lengthy consolidation area from Sept 2020 to March 2021.\n\nGiven everything that is going on with tapering and interest rates, and the fact that the most reliable price targets are ones that reflect a conjunction of technical and fundamental levels, I wouldn't be surprised to see Target 2 become a reality."

Crypto is going down, electricity(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis) is going up so mining is not cost effective as it used to be. On top of that issues in Kazakhstan, China, Russia - do your own research. Gaming will be still here and always was. AI revenue is expected to grow - but it is also effected by the innovation, many companies already have the HW. The revenue & earning were amazing in 2021 - dont take me wrong. Every company has a revenue/market cap a I don't dare to speculate how far is NVDA from it. \n\nFor me NVDA is definitely pass right now. Too many red flags. Lets see how the price looks in 2 weeks."

The earliest rate cut they believe could come at the 1/2024 meeting baring something dramatic happening to the economy that would necessitate rate cuts before then.  \n\n* The need for further rate increases is uncertain but less likely than before due to recent banking stress, which they feel has and will continue to lead to tighter lending conditions. \n\n* Inflation is easing slower than they expected despite improving supply chains (see quote below). \n\n\n\n> Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably\nhigh.

A reading below 50 signals contraction from the previous month. \n> \n> A non-manufacturing gauge of activity in the services and construction sectors slid to 54.5 from 56.4 in the previous month, also below expectations.\n\nI think this is why commodities might have sold off so viciously today; it was pricing in a bad China print (maybe got leaked).

Primarily AMD and Nvidia, but also companies like Microsoft, Tesla, Apple etc. which also rely on semiconductors for manufacturing, would their stock prices go down? I would imagine, especially since the entire stock market would take a hit, but particularly those that rely on imports from those countries. Of course I'm praying that no war breaks out but it does make me wonder what will happen to these companies that had been thriving up until recently.\"",

Too much uncertainty with geopolitics. If you are fine with that risk then go for it. Its probably not a bad deal.\n\nINTC? The company is flunking on every part of its business so much so that its barely profitable yet they\u2019re going to some how build these multi billion dollar factories across the country.

They've only just announced a partnership with Microsoft for investing in AI. Obviously they'll make a breakthrough sooner or later and have a nice pop. Plus it'll ride along with other AI stocks meanwhile. AMD is probably the safest choice here.\n\nNvidia can go either way. I view it as a 50/50 gamble at this point so I'm not adding more."

If they are allowed to acquire ARM its just a matter of time before they become a 1Trillion company, heck even if they dont....so anyway, i plan on selling a bit into earnings in case of bad results at which time i'll buy back over the next few days once the lows settle out...likewise if it pops i'll drop some more shares over the next few days of run ups to buy back after people forget and freak out over inflation/rising rates again.  rinse repeat retire...."

     "Lately it is $AMR. They are a US-based producer of metallurgical (abbreviated 'met') coal that exports to over 25 countries. Met coal is a key input used for steel production--don't get confused with thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity and whose use is generally more controversial.\n\nThe company is highly undervalued, even for a cyclical coal mining company. It is in the process of reducing its share count by about 30%. To quote some statistics from mid-March: \"It has a market cap of 2.6B and has 300M in net cash. Its 2022 FCF was $1.3B. They have $1.2B remaining in share buybacks authorized, having already done $560M in buybacks since first authorization (beginning 2022 I believe). I'm seeing FCF/EV yields of 30-40%.\" [Read that once more: it generated half its entire market cap in FCF last year]\n\nIt's roughly fairly priced if met coal prices were at $200 a ton, which is the average from 2010-2020. However, actual met prices are currently much higher thanks to surging demand from India/China, as well as bullish sentiment about steel usage in the US thanks to recent fiscal stimulus. [By contrast, thermal coal prices have less of a runway ahead of them barring a terribly cold winter in 2023/4]. We can't replace met coal just yet to produce steel, unlike thermal coal for power generation. Thermal coal can be phased out provided we make the right investments in nuclear/solar/wind/geothermal/hydro/natural gas/crude oil/..., all of which are better for the environment than thermal coal. I believe scientists are still experimenting ways to find cleaner ways of producing steel, like using hydrogen or other new materials. But that's a few decades away.\n\n2023 hasn't posed much of a slowdown at all for AMR, and it locks in contracts at great prices well in advance. Management has made clear they have *no* plans of expansion or M&A and are focused on share buybacks.\n\nI own shares at $153 a share, and it's roughly 1.5% of my portfolio (and will likely become close to 2%). I've been slowly buying in since January of this year.\n\nA similar company to AMR is ARCH, which is also met coal + thermal coal, or CEIX. (BTU is another company I'm excited about but it's a much riskier play than AMR. I'm equally bullish on AMR/BTU and can say more if people want)"

Its median (as well as the mean) PE ratio over the past 10 years has been around 31 so it would be nothing but reasonable to think that it will eventually reverts to the mean over the next years.\\nFor that to happen, either the share price takes a hit of 70% or the EPS grow to 10 and more.\\nAssuming the first one will stay exactly where it currently is and that the company will manage to grow their EPS at around 32% over the next years, it would take 4,5 years for the PE ratio to revert to the mean: in a scenario where NVDA, a 792b market cap company, keeps growing like crazy, someone investing at the current price would get 0% returns for quite a bit of years.\\n\\nShort-term speculation aside, which may or may not play in favour of those investing at the current price, why would someone choose NVDA over other opportunities right now?'",

     "PE ratios are not the best measure for high growth and high tech stocks. Many of these mega tech companies can go from PE ratios of 100 to 1 within one quarter if they stop investing completely in R&D and Marketing. Zero expenses in anything but COGS, and boom, you have an instantly super profitable company.\n\nSo take a look at their balance sheet as listed on their Q3 results: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2022\n\nEarnings for Q3 were 0.99/share, with the year end target of $3.50/share. So yes, PE of 100.\n\nBut look at where their expenses are. For the training 9 months, revenue of 19.2Bn, COGS of 6.7Bn. So gross margin of 76%. Then they have Operating Expenses of 5.4Bn. Let's break that down and say that NVDA stops completely investing in R&D and marketing, and slashes those costs by 80%. That means their operating expenses would fall to $1.1Bn.\n\nThat would boost their net income to $11.3Bn for the last 12 months, and give them an EPS of $4.54/share, and set them on track for a CY2021 EPS of $6.05. Now their PE ratio is 50. But that would be a one time thing, and without that R&D investment you can assume that NVDA won't remain competitive in their high tech field.\n\n\nLet's ask this another way. In September 2020, when MSFT was $225/share at mkt cap of 1.5T, would you have said \"that's overvalued\"? The secret to these mega tech companies that are executing well is that the create new markets and dominate them. How do you value a brand new market that doesn't exist yet? For NVDA, the bet is on AI. AI in research, AI in basic commercial consumer interactions, AI in professional visualization, AI everywhere. And this is the tip of the iceberg for such a huge market.\n\nIf you have 10 year time horizons, trying to look at current PE ratios to decide to invest in a company that's executing well is too myopic. I would instead try to understand whether you believe in that company to execute and grow new markets and new revenue streams to justify their existence.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget that the secondary stock market is all about supply/demand. The performance is only a tertiary factor in actual stock performance. Buying and selling stocks on exchanges has no impact on a company's performance at all."

     "It is a good investment, it is fairly easy to identify good companies to invest in. The problem here is getting it at an acceptable price. Keyword here is acceptable, ideally cheap, but if that's not possible, acceptable will do.\n\nThe thing with companies that are market leaders, they expand with the market and sometimes even create their own markets. So yes, past studies of financial ratios indeed give you a good idea of what to expect, but when companies create markets out of nothing, sometimes they are able to blow past any prior expectations.\n\nIt is very difficult to value things which do not currently exist yet, I don't know what is the market for the metaverse for example, nor can I evaluate accurately what is the TAM of Tesla's FSD. I can only guesstimate what the potential of these things are, and the reactions of the investors when certain things have been announced.\n\nJust be mindful that financial ratios are more backwards looking than they are forward looking, it is a useful matric to look at but you should understand what these ratios can and cannot tell you. PE ratios cannot tell you when a tech company will release the next big thing, and fundamental change the company's outlook.\n\nSomeone who followed AMD news/technical reviews closely might have a hint of when Ryzen is coming back in 2017, yet someone who studies the ratios won't ever see it coming.\n\nSomeone who chooses NVDA over current offerings place a higher value on the company's technological prowess as opposed to their financials, they probably taken financials into consideration and judged that what NVDA is doing is worth the extra premium."

I haven't played any other game that made me think \"wow, these people truly give a shit about the product they make\" as much as GTA has. \n\nThe micro transactions may be a little out of hand from a players perspective but if I'm a shareholder then it's all smiles from me haha.\n\nIk this does nothing to answer your question.

The leadership team here will continue to make the right decisions, and they put an emphasis on creating value to the shareholders.\nThe price and valuation are very high, but I believe they are justified. The expected earnings growth is phenomenal, and they ALWAYS beat expectations. Don\u2019t use a lagging PE when talking about valuations, at least use PEG. \nDo yourself a favor, buy NVDA and hold it for a couple years.

     "1st you need to understand that this is a fanatical stock. The sentiment is dominated by gamers and crypto miners and if you are either, you know how they can be total zealots. Thats the biggest warning I can give you. Right now they are high on NVDA but the knife cuts both ways and if the tide turns, price will fall below reason as well.\n\nSee CD Projekt Red to see what happens when Gamer sentiment turns. They seem to believe that CDR is dead and all future games they make will fail. The price has been shredded despite the best financial year in their history, low PE (albeit cyclical), massive dividend, and re-alignment to make twice as many games going forward... But the sentiment is apocalyptic. They may as well had help make COVID in the Wuhan lab at this point given how people are talking about them. Which is perfect if you are a buyer now but not so much if you were in prior.\n\nSo back to NVDA, that is what you are facing. Crazy investors. Not bad folks, but just nuts. Can be a good thing if you take advantage of it but can also cut the other way.\n\nFundamentally NVDA in a good place business wise. But its not rainbows and unicorns. For one thing, they are currently heavily influenced by crypto mining. Whether you think thats good or bad is a matter of opinion. Im of the opinion that this is not good for business because if cryto goes away, they may well lose 50% of their rev... the risk is high.\n\nThe other issue is PC sales really havent gone anywhere in a while and there is a good chance that the move to streaming gaming will eat a huge portion of the gaming market especially consoles, down the road. I would imagine they (Sony, MS, NIN) are all eager to switch to cloud based streaming if they can to eliminate the high cost of consoles and charge monthly fees (and such). So just like how we switched from hard copies to downloads the last 10 years, we may be switching again to streaming in the future. This would be horrible for video cards.\n\nNow I am not saying all the above will happen and maybe you dont plan to hold that long anyway. But that would be my bearish argument for a long hold. In the near term, they are obviously overpriced... that is unless you think that they can maintain 50%+ growth for the next 3-4 years or so."

Population growth, expansion of technology and increasing  mass density of investment with limited  quality investment opportunities suggests the moment you invest, in the log run, is less important than making the investment.  For fun, as an educational opportunity, compare compare equity prices of companies at finance.Google.com.  The growth curves (slopes) offer some great visuals and basis for trajectories .  Nothing is guaranteed, however past performance as a prediction of future performance is usually valid.  Yeah, how many people believed that with ENRON & GE?!!!  Buffett places confidence in the stock market,  often pointing out growth of the S&P 500.  Use the finance Google charts to compare ETFs and Stocks to each other and  an index like SPY.  Sure there are short term opportunistic opportunities to buy (buy low/sell high) that might add (beneficially) to total long term profit significantly, still over time you\u2019ll see the price continues to increase as the global economy expands.  NVDA I has stellar innovation and production character.  Chips are key to our present grasp of technology and mega trends.  Incremental investments over time, dollar cost averaging makes sense.  If you believe and trust mankind will continue to rely and innovate with technology and science, efficiencies and expansion are likely also."

     "Outside of ChatGPT, AI hasn\u2019t even started at scale yet. Sure, people are buying MSFT and NVDA, but both of those tickers are still below their high from 2021. I pay close attention to the machine learning community and can assure you no one serious is talking about time travel or anything that goes against the laws of physics. When it comes to AI tech and large language models, it\u2019s the real deal and the development cycles are now measured in days and months. \n\nAlso, this isn\u2019t blockchain or the metaverse \u2014 AI is already powerful enough today, that as of 2 days ago, some scientists and people like Elon Musk are petitioning to slow down the pace of its development (I don\u2019t agree we should, but shows how smart minds are taking AI very seriously). So, yes there will be an AI stock bubble at some point (probably later this year and next), but imo we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. That said, because it\u2019s so early, one caveat is it\u2019s not yet clear where the value capture for AI will be \u2014 aside from companies with established competitive advantages (MSFT/OpenAI, NVDA) and maybe some semis (TSMC, ASML, AMD etc), it\u2019s a bit premature to pile into AI growth stocks (eg, C3.ai)"

Not only are they taking on Google but they will replace as many jobs as they possibly can to collect service fees. All they have to do is provide a service equal to or greater than any human and they'll replace 3/4 of every call center team. I suspect most organizations will require a few humans to learn from but the vast majority of calls will be replaced. In Canada, what would be a 50k role MSFT might collect 10k. This is assuming MSFT is the company that drives that optimization. It's also possible that a Startup provides that service. In which case they pay open AI for the access and MSFT gets there cut from the server utilization. I can't seem to find any information on whether Microsoft is an investor of OpenAI but I hope they are. That way investing in Microsoft at least means exposure to OpenAI which is currently private.\n\nI also think OpenAI's chatGPT is going to become the invisible 5th member of any team.

If you look back at the .com bubble - it\u2019s major run up started in 1998, however it didn\u2019t bottom out until 2001-2002. This is because everyone realized the internet would be the next big thing (like AI) but there are a lot of unknowns. Who will succeed, how profitable, etc. \n\nA company could come out tomorrow with a huge breakthrough in AI hardware or software, which I believe would cause many of the other companies to fall. Or there could be a few lackluster earnings reports, and many investors may lose patience and look to put their capital towards companies with better results, especially during a time of economic uncertainty. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to price something that is almost completely unknown, so I suspect there will be wild price action for a while. You are best off DCA into Nasdaq if you believe in the future of AI as there is no way of knowing who will win/lose. \nBetting against the success of AI isn\u2019t smart and it isn\u2019t investing - it\u2019s gambling."

I'd be interested to see how good would a potential model be at learning new information from e.g. company-specific internal data source (documentation, etc.). Of course information like that is minuscule in comparison to the datasets LLMs are normally trained on, and so potentially it might still not do that great.\n\nAlso there's an issue of accuracy - sure, the model may be impressive at times, but that doesn't account for much if you can't really trust it - there has to be a person fact-checking and overseeing the output anyway. It might speed up some processes, but people may be blindsided by how impressive it appears, vs how useful it actually is."

NVDA shows $5 billion for quarterly revenue January 21 and AMD is showing $3.44 billion for the same time period. So roughly, 1.5 times as much revenue.\\n\\nNVDA is shown being valued at $370 billion and AMD at $97 billion.  That means NVDA is worth almost 4 times as much with only 1.5 times the revenue.  Why is this?  \\n\\nI like AMD and have been invested since March of last year and plan to keep buying more, but I just wonder why they are worth so much less.  Again, I am sure I am missing something very fundamental here so any input is greatly appreciated.\"",

     "Other can answer with the more intangible items. From a financial perspective, let's take a look at the 10K's of each company (since this is the last filing of NVDA). Over the last fiscal year, here are some key stats:\n\nRevenue:\n\nNVDA: $16.7B / AMD: $9.7B (hrmmm this seems closer than 4x like you mention, more like 1.7x)\n\nGross Profit:\n\nNVDA: $10.3B / AMD: 4.3B (Interesting, it appears NVDA has better margins so now we are close to 2.5x)\n\nIncome Before Taxes:\n\nNVDA: $4.4B / AMD: $1.3B (Now we are all the way up to 3.4x, so getting close to 4x. This shows AMD has lower margins, and higher comparative expenses).\n\nNet Income:\n\nNVDA: $4.3B / AMD:$ 2.5B (Woah we dropped down to 1.72x. If we look, this is due to AMD having carryover losses and Tax carry forwards that reduced AMD's tax burden and net them returns instead of paying taxes hence why they have more net income than they earned).\n\nSo what can we conclude on this? Don't just look at revenue. A company can have an insane amount of revenue, but if they are inefficient or have too many operating expenses, they could potentially have  little to no revenue. Next, comparatively, if we ignore the losses and credits AMD took to boost their net income, NVDA is actually coming close to that 4x difference we are seeing in valuation. That and all the intangibles others are mentioning, and AMD's recent pull back, attribute to the difference."

     "As someone in an industry that largely depends on video cards (game design), I can give a simple answer. NVDA has a relative monopoly on the space, and have been making partnerships to ensure that their cards are a standard for developers. AMD is beating Intel in the processor space, but demands have expanded much more towards the video card sector recently for various reasons, and I sort of feel like Intel is destined to be a Compaq that has been too slow to adapt.\n\nThat said, I think AMD can seriously challenge NVDA, but they need a serious focus on that area which is difficult."

     "My personal opinion is that most analysts and investors aren't that into electronics and tech and dont see the upcoming potential of AMD.\nWe saw huge impact in the CPU marked with AMDs chiplet technology and following AMDs roadmap its the plan to do the same thing in the GPU market. The upcoming RDNA3 chiplet graphics cards are said to be very, very fast and even much faster what NVidia can offer. There are some very promising leaks and the chiplet designs makes it possible to cut the time to market so AMD could probably be 3-6 monts ahead of Nvidia with even better products in the next GPU cycle.\nThis leads to better public recognition, probably higher prices and margins and after all higher revenue in graphics segment.\n\nAlso AMD is switching to 5nm next year when intel just try to improve its 10nm process. The 6nm APU Rembrandt and the 5nm version 1 year later will surely gain more market share in mobile and OEM market.\n\nFor me its most likely that Intel and Nvidia will loose market share to AMD and AMD will increase margins over time.\n\nI think its possible to double the revenue in die upcoming 1.5 years."

With regards to personal computing, Intel has led on the central processor front for decades in terms of market share, partnerships with oems, and performance. At the same time, NVIDIA has dominated the consumer/professional/gaming graphics card segment, in terms of market share, technology, and performance. \n\nAfter building my AMD based PC in 2019, started really paying attention to parts, and news regarding AMD's products. Wife was convinced to buy in at a measly 30-40 a share, IIRC. And they have since performed beyond expectations. Their consumer products do not quite make the very top in terms of overall performance, but their value proposition in consumer products has yielded high growth in terms of adoption, and they are starting to secure deals with OEMs. \n\nTL;DR AMD is David vs Goliath on the two most important fronts AMD has.

Their stock price rise seems to be more about can Intel shit itself even more.\n\nWhat is next for Nvidia, artificial intelligence ?\n\n'' On September 13, 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Arm Inc. from SoftBank Group Corp. (TSE:9984) for $40 billion.10 Arm is a U.K.-based semiconductor and software design company specializing in CPU architecture. Nvidia says the acquisition will help it to expand its AI capacities and advance a range of technologies from cloud computing and smartphones to self-driving cars and the internet of things (IoT).11 Nvidia noted in its annual FY 2021 filings that the transaction is expected to close some time in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.12 ''\n\nLooks like Nvidia has always been more universal and are pushing for something big, if they succeed that will be quite the money banger.\n\nWhich company would people rather buy for next 5 - 20 years ?

NVidia GPUs reliably outsell AMD GPUs, but lets call that a wash....AMD CPUs beat intel lately(usually not forever), but have super high margins so not very profitable and both chips are likely to be made obsolete by ARM based CPUs from apple and now Nvidia if they make the ARM acquisition....and that's the big one, if Nvidia gets into the CPU race, offering an Apple M1 like product for windows, that's a big hit to AMD(and intel).  Nvidia network compute growth has almost matched it's graphics in just a couple years, so the hype is strong...AMD is kinda running out of steam after beating Intel down the last few years.  given a long enough time period, both will likely meet their price valuations and even go higher, but in a shorter term they are very risky to any market correction.  I will add, AMD does not have a dividend unlike Nvidia(or Intel) so it's a bit harder to hold for very long periods."

As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, lets use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the companys average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\\n\\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companys shares.\\n\\nSo we have nvidias equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billion'",

In the last 10 years the minimum was 12.79, the median 31.09 and the maximum 96.39. For the PE ratio to get back to median value there are two possibilities, either the company grows faster than expected (quite difficult since a generous growth has already been priced in) or the share price falls.\n\nHope I give you another perspective on the NVDA valuation!"

     "Here is my constructive feedback and saying this all in a nice way. Half your analysis is explaining EBITDA and other metrics. People can Google what EBITDA is and how it\u2019s calculated if they don\u2019t know. It made your write up longer than it needed to be. Also, you flip flop back and forth in numbers (billions and millions). I don\u2019t think NVidia has 19782 billion is cash, I think you are missing a period after the 9 maybe. Also, use commas (or a space depending on where you are located in the world) between thousands (19,782 for instance). It\u2019s so difficult to quickly understand the number without commas. Sorry to harp so much on format, but if format is no good people will not respect the content of your analysis. Another example is when you say Nvidea 5 year growth is 1.401%. I assume you mean 1,401%. Any analysis you post publicly should be much tighter formatting/reviewed. Good luck in your investing."

     "I don't quite understand why people compare valuation ratios with the industry average. Isn't it possible the entire sector is in a bubble? This is a genuine question. I would appreciate an answer.\n\nGPU crypto mining is more likely to die out than to grow. As far as I know, no new crypto project uses Proof of Work. That leaves us with Bitcoin and its cousins. If Bitcoin succeeds, mining difficulty will ratchet up and GPUs will not even be considered for mining. If Bitcoin fails, no one will want to mine anyway. And already, most of network's hashing power comes from ASIC rigs, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nFor gaming, NVIDIA does have a pretty good moat in PC gaming, eventhough they have lost the consoles to AMD for now. And AMD is closing in. But, I think the bigger threat is a good game streaming service. If Google Stadia or a hypothetical Apple service becomes good, which I think is highly likely, they won't have any trouble catching a userbase, given their extensive ecosystem. While GeForce Now might be a good subscription model for NVIDIA, IMO it'll be difficult for it to compete against a service that comes with an entrenched ecosystem. While it is possible that NVIDIA chips power those game streaming services, it is also possible that they don't. With AMD closing in, and the larger trend of companies designing their own chips, no telling how that might go.\n\nI welcome critical comments."

     ">Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn\u2019t as black and white, but that\u2019s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIn the short amount of time, e.g. daily trading, human psychology may convert or is more or less unanimous. And that can be captured neatly in a stock's price.\n\nBut stock price is one dimensional.  Over a long period of time, the psychology on why someone or some institution buys or sells a stock becomes complicated.   The one dimensional stock price cannot possibly capture the psychology behind buying and selling."

     "My critique of this DD is that it is not finished! You have done a great job at what you've done so far, and it's a really good base to perform a more thorough valuation, but there is more digging to be had here. The most important thing is trying to figure out how much money you think the business will make over time. It doesn't have to be 100% accurate, but there should always be a rough idea of how much you expect them to make. When you do this, it's important to factor in the risk of the business going under or being outcompeted (make sure you discount that from how much money you expect them to make). Also it's really important to understand how their business works. Personally, I know nothing about tech, but this could be a great play for someone who understands the industry better than me. \n\nBasically I think you've done a great job here, but you have more work to do! What I'd recommend you do from here is skim more quarterly and annual reports to see how they work on the more minute levels. Anyhow, you're doing amazing, keep up the good work! (:"

LLM AI on the other hand has real world applications and is already disrupting many white collar  jobs.  For now, betting on Nvidia (the proverbial guy selling shovels during the gold rush) is a smart bet.  But longer term I expect the need for expensive GPUs to diminish as the training cost (for LLM models) decreases due to smarter training algorithms. We\u2019re already seeing techniques like LoRA that\u2019s allowing models to be trained at fraction of the original cost.  So I don\u2019t think Nvidia is a smart bet long term for Ai, but think Ai will be around for a while (who knows which LLM AI will prevail), and it remains to be seen if the societal disruption from LLM leads to net a positive."

I was in college at the time but everyone had Netflix.  2008-2009 it was almost non existent for most but by 2011 it was HUGE amongst the college population. My reasoning was simply, if everyone we know has it/uses it and the stock just dropped 75%, when is a better time to buy?\n\n\nI was in the investment club in college and really enjoyed the thought of day trading. I begged my parents for some money and they basically said I had to hold onto whatever I bought for at least 1 year rather than day trading.  \n\n\nTurned $5k into $20k by the time I graduated by sitting on NFLX.

Does anyone have any thoughts / concerns in this regard that Etherium is moving away from proof of work to proof of stake?  Wondering if this shift in Eth would have a material impact on nvidias sales?  Miners would buy multiple GPUs for mining purposes, whereas a gamer needs only one.  Those are just my thoughts.'",

     "Think NVDA will be fine in the short/medium term.  Why I continue to have a material position long.\n\nBut I do worry longer term.  I believe the future is more and more the big guys making their own chips.\n\nGoogle for example is doing their own in the Pixel 6 and will also start to offer Chromebooks with their own chips starting in 2023.\n\nAmazon is starting to do their own chips for their cloud.   Tesla is doing their own client AI chips in the cars.  But still using Nvidia for the back-end.\n\nI do not see this trend ending.    Because the industry has completely changed.   There was a time that Intel made the chips and Dell purchased and put in their servers and sold to an end company.   There was literally 10s of millions of companies buying the servers.\n\nToday it is more and more the servers come from Google, Amazon or Microsoft with their clouds.  It completely changes the calculus of the chip business.   Take the power needed to run the servers.  That was just not high on the list of features when the 10s of millions of companies were buying the servers.  But today with Google having literally millions and millions of servers it makes a huge difference to lower the power footprint.\n\nThere was a time I was responsible for buying servers and I do not remember even considering the power footprint when we purchased.  We did the generation before with the mainframes because they needed special power and we had to make sure it was available.\n\nIt is the reason Google created the TPUs.  They could not afford to run the hardware available at the time.   It is also a big reason that Google designed all their own network processors.\n\nhttps://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/09/google_processor/\n\n\"Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers\nGoogle has detailed its TPU---and the tremendous savings that came with it.\"\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/\n\nThe companies today have resources unlike companies of the past.   But they then also have the ROI with their massive infrastructure to justify designing and building their own chips.\n\nTo me the place that is going to kill it is companies like TSMC that have the Fabs.  I do NOT think the Google's of the world are going to do their own FABs.  But I guess that could happen down the road.\n\nIt is interesting to watch because I am really old and we are returning more and more to how things use to be.\n\nIt is also why I own more GOOG than I do NVDA.  GOOG is just a lot safer for the long term."

     "This is one of the most crucial points when we discuss about NVDA shareprice. As far as I surveyed, in 2017-2018 It was estimated to be around 50% of GPU cards are occupied by miners and now, analysts are estimating that the percentage is dropped to 25%. Plus, Nvidia is now selling Low Hash Rate cards and Coin Mining Processors so I believe that they can push down that number even lower from now. \n\nSo my take on this issue is that I don't think coin mining is the wolf at the door. I worry more about data center demand because once all the companies buy AI chips for their servers, there will be a cycle where demand dwindles a lot. We won't be able to avoid that shareprice drop if that happens... \ud83d\ude24"

If it has a noticeable pullback, I might get in with a few shares in anticipation of the upcoming split, since stocks generally tend to do better after splits.\n\nAMD is also running quite hot right now, and a discount free cash flow valuation shows that it's well above what its intrinsic value should be. If I was looking to buy one of these, I'd wait for a pullback first.\n\nOf course, I'm saying this as someone who's currently holding INTC shares and utterly disappointed by how far this once-dominant CPU giant has fallen."

The proof of work model for crypto isn't sustainable long term and is being replaced by better solutions. Crypto is fascinating and disruptive, but there's no reason to believe that GPU mining is mandatory for a crypto future. On the gaming side of things, every major GPU manufacturer will be competing for TSMC supply. Intel is prepared to hurt their own margins in order to make pricing competitive. This can eat into Nvidia's margins and impact future earnings. RDNA 3 will be competitive with Lovelace in performance. We'll see how Alchemist turns out, but there's no reason why Intel can't be competitive in the GPU space if they're properly managed.\n\nLook at what happened to growth companies that missed their lofty growth targets just recently. That could definitely happen to Nvidia. This could present a great buying opportunity since Nvidia is a great company, but people should be aware that a drop is very possible."

This way they will quickly make modifications on upcoming models and release new models very quickly. Even apple M1 chip also same. This approach can be success only if they control the market which NVDA has.\nIt is easy that NVDA can kill intel cpu than Intel kill NVDA gpu as GPUs are more powerful than CPU.\nNVDA chips are using all most all of tech company data centers and government institutions. They have long term contracts. Tsla and Mercedes-auto drive use NVDA chips. NVDA also owing quantum computers. It is feature proof. As Jim mentioned, May be NVDA is fist $10T company."

There are some winners and losers in the K-shaped curve, but for the macroeconomy there seems to be no sign of recession big enough to get the Fed to cut rates.\n\nIf the government continues more deficit spending, there maybe a crowding out in the bond market, where the government will be selling more bonds causing the price of bonds to decline and rates to increase. This may put more pressure on the Fed to increase rates and certainly not cut rates."

Stock dividends require journal entries. Stock dividends are recorded by moving amounts from retained earnings to paid-in capital. The amount to move depends on the size of the distribution. A small stock dividend (generally less than 20-25% of the existing shares outstanding) is accounted for at market price on the date of declaration. A large stock dividend (generally over the 20-25% range) is accounted for at par value.*"

Because the stock split is being initiated in the form of a stock dividend, the ex-dividend date governs which investors are eligible to receive the newly split shares. In this case, NVIDIA's stock split goes ex-dividend on July 19, according to a spokesperson for brokerage house Charles Schwab.This means that investors can buy NVIDIA shares right up to July 19, and still be eligible to receive the additional shares from the stock split once the shares begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens July 20.\" \n\nThis coincides with what TD Ameritrade told you.

Investing in new fab tech is always a multi-year gamble ahead and we haven\u2019t seen the customer base or the steep investment in new cutting edge fab techniques. \n\nWhat intel has going for it is xenophobic gov buyers who want American vertical integration, even if it means semiconductors are less efficient or several generations behind the state of the art."

Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs.

You end up with a smaller slice of the pie, but it's now a bigger pie. So where do you lose?\nWhatever they buy will add value to your shares.\n\nDisclaimer: Very, very simplified view but hopefully it'll stop people freaking out about this.

     "Do we trust Nvidia\u2019s management to use these shares appropriately? I trust Jensen to lead the company, but why do they need to do this?\n\nWith currently 2 billion shares authorised for issuance against 619M shares outstanding, we already have a possible dilution of your 1 share being worth 0.236 shares. If they\u2019re authorised to issue another 2 billion shares, then that brings us down to 0.134x worth the value before issuance. This is an extra ~56% reduction in our share of equity on top of the possible ~76% reduction we already have.\n\nTo see how this is even remotely something worth voting for, in my view, Nvidia would have to increase operating earnings/FCF by at least the same multiplier at which they dilute our shares. Simultaneously I would also like to see them maintain their high return on equity, be able to retain a larger portion of their earnings and if not return that portion in the form of buybacks and dividend payouts. Hopefully if shares are used for mergers, that management can recognise when our shares are overvalued and the business to be acquired undervalued, then mergers will be of great value for us.\n\nTaking such a possible dilution cuts your portion of wealth and ownership significantly and I, and I think many of you also, would like to see a great return for it.\n\nIf the extra shares weren\u2019t included for use in executive and employee compensation I would feel a lot better about this proposal. The option of lining their own pockets at the expense of your investment still exists."

     "Nice writeup, not too long and a good categorization of pros and cons.\n\nI have written about NVDA a few times before, I am long since 2019 with a cost basis of $139.50. For a long time, NVDA was about 5% of my portfolio (I prefer to hold about 20 high conviction, long-term companies in my portfolio at any given time) but recently, NVDA as a position has now fallen to more like 2-3% of my portfolio. I would therefore also like to add more (at least double my position), but I am apprehensive about the valuation (the obvious time to add would have been in March 2020, duh...).\n\nAnyway, I do believe that Nvidia can eventually easily get to $100B+ in annual revenues. I work in a \"niche\" field that's not quite cloud, HPC or gaming but has similar technology requirements and I foresee a version of the future where the ARM-based Nvidia DPUs dominate the generic backend compute that is still dominated by x86 today (Intel and AMD). This is also the reason why I am not nearly as bullish on AMD as I am on Nvidia. Also as a side note, we use Mellanox NICs and they are a great company/team and a technology leader in what they do (I prefer their NICs over e.g. Solarflare).\n\nTo summarize, I am starting to think that I might have been wrong about the valuation with Nvidia and indeed missed some good buying opportunities during the last 6-8 months when it was available for below $500 (even after the post March 2020 recovery). Just to explain myself better, I do consider myself a value investor and typically the earnings multiple is one of the first things I look at. A lot (but not all) of my other 5% holdings are more classic \"value\".\n\nAnd just to clarify something, the thing is, from a purely quantitative POV,  40x forward earnings is not insanity... at 20% annual earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples up to 40 (or even 50) can be acceptable (see \"Security Analysis\" by Graham et al). It's all about what the risk is with respect to the company being able to maintain its current earnings growth trajectory.\n\nThe $300B EV might be another thing that understandably turns people off, but obviously at some point Nvidia can start accelerating stock buybacks.\n\nFWIW, I am not adding yet at these levels, but I am seriously thinking about it.\n\nP.S. One thing about Nvidia is that it's not a SW company so it doesn't have SW company margins or ROC/ROA. However, part of its moat is the barrier of entry and uniqueness in the competitive space. Like you said, a risk is that the IaaS companies / cloud providers will use their profits to design and build their own chips (in that scenario, ARM is still a major winner though)."

We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think \"gambling\" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.\n\nIf you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.\n\nI think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important."

OEMs and system integrators are scared of AMD for some reason, which helps Nvidia's (& Intel's) sales. \n\nSome bearish stuff would be Apple and AMD. AMD has almost caught up with Nvidia in the last 3 years, which means that AMD will be taking market share away in the GPU market. Apple's M1 chips are the best in the market for power efficiency and relative performance, so I'd expect Apple to gain market share through their hardware. \n\nI'm holding Nvidia, AMD, and Apple at fairly even amounts, mostly because I'm bullish on those consumer semiconductor manufacturers as a whole rather than 1 individual stock."

     "They're incredibly expensive, but they also have a practical monopoly on AI training. It's not really even their products, AMD, Google, Tesla, Amazon do have somewhat comparable products and AMD might beat them in price/performance for gaming. None of that really matters due to the sheer market dominance Nvidia has.\n\nPeople aren't really content with Nvidia having such dominance though, many don't like their prices and I think that is driving a lot of new competitors, but so far everyone has failed trying to compete with Nvidia. 8 out of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world use Nvidia, 70% of new supercomputers use Nvidia, remember that GPU acceleration is only a subsection of supercomputers, some workloads only use CPU and Nvidia isn't even in that space, still they got 70% overall market share in supercomputers. These people are the ones who place one order for 10,000 GPUs for $15k a pop, just for one project or application.\n\n[https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/openai-azure-supercomputer/)\n\nThat's like 3% of their quarterly revenue done in one order, there's a lot of business potential with AI popping up everywhere. OpenAI I think is making bank with GPT-3 and you got self driving starting to become really popular, companies and institutions are dying to order these 10,000 GPU systems from Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's gross margins are really ridiculous at +65%, and 41% operating margin is also crazy, their growth is crazy. In data center they grew 97%, over 5 years they're average growth in data center has been 82%, their revenue growth overall grew 61% Y/Y.\n\nWith the silicon shortage I think people have started to accept the higher prices for GPUs as well. On the silicon side, investment keeps increasing and there's a great roadmap for the next 5 years, generation performance increase will remain strong. Nvidia is spending $4 billion on R&D, 23% of net revenue which is another great long term sign, they really keep making great products. They got their co-founder as CEO Jensen Huang, and he's got a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford.\n\nTheir stock price really is outrageous, but if there's one company who deserves it, it's Nvidia because they're doing everything right. I sold out of them when the arm deal seemed to stall out, but I think it's probably time to back in because people seem to have gotten over that."

     "It always blows my mind how people buy right after earnings. For example, ABT is currently up 8% on an earnings beat. Who sees a stock go up 8% in one day and thinks \"yeah, I think now's the time I'll buy.\" Bruh, the idea is to buy BEFORE it skyrockets, not after. Although, I guess NVDA buyers are proving me wrong every day.\n\nEdit: FOMOers pretty mad right now. There's almost always a pullback. This is called chasing, and it is irrational. When you buy after a stock has already skyrocketed, you're buying into momentum, which won't last long. ABT will likely correct soon, just like any other stock that jumps disproportionately to its earnings beat. I can't say when or by how much, but all else equal and it'll happen. DCAing always wins; loading up during a momentum-based run is just stupid"

     "Arhaus (ARHS) is an interesting stock. A high-end furniture retailer with 72 stores currently. They listed in 2021 and are down ~34% from IPO. They've had consistently growing earnings since IPO but recently tanked on slowing EPS growth. \n\nThings I find interesting are that ~50% of their customers make more than $200k per year. On the one hand this might insulate them from a downturn as wealthier people tend to be less affected, but on the other hand they will likely still cut back on discretionary spending. They currently have a PE of ~8 and a future PE of ~9.\n\nDownsides are a lot of debt, looks like ~$700M. They had a ton of growth in 2022 which has slowed, might be a one hit wonder and unable to keep up the growth. They only IPOd in 2021 which to me usually means not enough of a track record to judge."

     "I wanted to share my story about my stock experience. I started trading stocks 2 years at the peak in 2021 and invested 2K. Most of my trading knowledge was self-taught although my friend shared all he knew about stocks with me as well. I opened an account with Webull in 2021 and immediately started investing in companies without much due diligence. I often went with trends and popular picks at the time. This certainly helped me with meme stocks like blackberry and SLGG at the time in which I made a profit but ultimately I made a lot of mistakes. By 2023 my account value was worth 1.1k and I ultimately did take the loss because I ended up needing to sell my losses bc I had never placed a stop loss or take profit order. Basically I quit stocks all together in 2022 but one thing I always knew was that I always seemed to find the hidden gem companies pretty often but never had the capital to invest bc I was in school with no disposable income. During the recent banking crisis I bought several stocks and I am happy to say that I have once again found my love for trading and I am more motivated than ever to build back my losses and get my account back to 2K or more. For instance, today my limit order to sell WAL will likely occur because the stock shot up to 39 in pre and could go further. I bought several shares at 23$ so feels good to know that buying on the dip returned me a huge profit!!!"

An actual neutral view is more like:\n\n45% | 10% | 45%\n\nMonetary policy is an extremely dangerous and blunt tool if not used cautiously.  It just doesn't work with the precision that people are hoping for.  That's the job of Congress to carry the remaining load.\n\n**Unemployment does not increase linearly it's not going to increase exactly 0.5% as the consensus states, once it goes up 50bps it tends to increase 150bps or 200bps.**  That's just human momentum and inertia at play and there's tons of data to support this.\n\nAnd that's why I am bullish.  I don't even think unemployment TOUCHES 4%.  Because Fed knows Congress is incompetent, they're the only adults in the room and stability of the entire system (and perhaps even global economy) is in their hands. I believe Fed will move very cautiously and my forecast looks like this:\n\n80% | 10% | 10%\n\nThe small cap Ra Ra crowd DOES NOT want me to be wrong, trust me.  In fact, small cap gets obliterated if Fed makes a policy error and overtightens.  They tend to drawdown even more aggressively vs. wider market and have even greater chance of having solvency issues.  Especially the low PE ones."

     "- Oil hitting year to date highs today as dollar weakens. WH claims it wishes to start SPR refills in H2 of this year (which is risky because that's precisely when the oil market is projected to tighten). Meanwhile Congressionally mandated SPR sales will continue for a  few more months. My prediction: they're not going to do it in time. Oil market is going up.\n\n- Meanwhile Europe appears to be lagging on signing longer-term LNG contracts. They got lucky this winter, but not signing long-term contracts is risky. Qatar and US (and other) exporters require long-term contracts, especially since they need financing to build the infrastructure / expand production. This hesitancy means they will have to buy natural gas on the spot market (= immediate delivery). If prices tighten by next winter, which they will thanks to Asian demand and limited US export capacity, this will hit Europe's finances. The smart move would be to lock in prices now before they spike again. Germany just shut down one of their nuclear plants. What do you think they will use inste--coal. It's coal. Just last year they tore up a village to build a lignite mine. [Here are German police keeping protestors away from the giant wheel tearing up the dirt](https://i.imgur.com/pX3vGIU.png).\n\n- China is warning of power shortages in the summer. This happened in previous summers when their hydropower capacity was hit hard by heatwaves. It forced industrial shutdowns, where at times all factories were closed for days. And that was with Covid lockdowns intermittent. An example of coal demand in China [pointed out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/YanQinyq/status/1645827635866370054): \"In the past seven months, Guangdong province has fast-tracked approval of 20.48 GW Coal-fired power plants (22 units), data from Shizhimedia news. The last time Guangdong approved a coal plant was in October 2019.\" China in 2022 approved the addition of on average 2 new coal plants a week (enough to power the entire UK).\n\n- [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indias-power-output-grows-fastest-pace-33-years-fuelled-by-coal-2023-04-05/):  \"India's power generation grew at the fastest pace in over three decades in the just-ended fiscal year, a Reuters analysis of government data showed, fuelling a sharp surge in emissions as output from both coal-fired and renewable plants hit records. Intense summer heatwaves, a colder-than-usual winter in northern India and an economic recovery led to a jump in electricity demand, forcing India to crank up output from coal plants and solar farms as it scrambled to avoid power cuts.\"\n\nHow serious is India about energy?\n\n- \"For the second year in a row, India\u2019s government has ordered the nation\u2019s coal-fired power plants to run at full power. But this year\u2019s order is even more sweeping than last year\u2019s \u2014 all coal and oil-fired generators will be maxed out for the entire summer, from April through June.\" \n\nIndia and China (and other emerging markets) are hungry for energy, and they will add enormous quantities of both renewable and fossil fuel capacity to meet this demand. Unfortunately for the world, this means more thermal coal usage (my investment case is not an endorsement of carbon emissions and ultimately none of this is good). Thermal coal may be dying in the US, as more plants get phased out, but it's  not dying elsewhere. Even in green Europe, we know they will burn more coal due to an unwillingness to use LNG, renewables, or nuclear power in sufficient quantity. \n\nNone of this implies a slow in growth for renewables, to emphasize. All countries are investing massive amounts of money into solar/wind/EVs. This will tighten the copper market dramatically as China reaccelerates its industrial/construction activity. It also means more steel demand (which means tighter met coal markets).\n\nWhat does this imply? Tighter crude oil + LNG + thermal coal markets. Copper prices will rise as will met coal for renewables + industrial activity.\n\nLong BTU, AMR, FCX, XOM, PSCE ..."

     "Interesting paper \"We study long-run shareholder outcomes for over 64,000 global common stocks during the January 1990 to December 2020 period.  We document that the majority, 55.2% of U.S. stocks and 57.4% of non-U.S. stocks, under perform one-month U.S. Treasury bills in terms of compound returns over the full sample.  Focusing on aggregate shareholder outcomes, we find that the top-performing 2.4% of firms account for all of the $US75.7 trillion in net global stock market wealth creation from 1990 to December 2020.  Outside the US, 1.41% of firms account for the $US 30.7trillion in net wealth creation. \"  Last updated march 7 originally published in 2019.\n\n[https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=973027002121126084021069097111116102121064057008063030022095021122071068004093103006055120040032010124035127105120092094076117058020029085067020024067083113007068103073043095002076009109019000122102092067124085029088099093019008016120113066064070003091&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=973027002121126084021069097111116102121064057008063030022095021122071068004093103006055120040032010124035127105120092094076117058020029085067020024067083113007068103073043095002076009109019000122102092067124085029088099093019008016120113066064070003091&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE)"

     "I believe $ALLY bank is being unfairly punished with other smaller banks even though I believe they can prosper without the Fed cutting rates.\n\n* As an online only tech-focused bank, they don't have physical branches.  With superior expense structure they can offer very competitive rates while still maintaining above average NIM 3.72% way above industry.\n* Most banks make money by ripping off customers with 0.5% APY hoping they are too lazy or uneducated to notice.  Ally passes on expense savings to customers and fair returns instead.  As a result their deposits keep increasing.  Their deposits increased nearly $11B to $152B in 2022.  \n* All other banks are struggling with shrinking deposit bases as rapidly rising rates exposes their business model flaws.  People are realizing they are scammed and moving to brokered CDs or money market funds.  https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=12qaI\n* They have almost no duration risk since they focus on auto loans and it's all booked FV, marked to market.\n* Wide moat and brand.  96% customer retention.  Consistently awarded \"best places to work\", \"companies that care\" etc.  Raised their minimum wage to $23 and gives every single employee 100 shares of stock to make them owners.  Invests heavily in their employees.\n\nBear case:\n\nIt's important to understand risks though.  They are sensitive to a recession since a downturn means auto loans go bad.\n\n* Another strong bout of deflation in used cars can hurt their loan values ability to recover on defaulted loans.  This is a big driver of declining loan values in 2022 for them. However, there's evidence in wholesale cars that used cars will actually surge and CPI data is very lagging.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/03/21/used-car-prices-inflation-fed/11493470002/\n\n* Moreover they are extremely conservative with ALLL or allowance for loans and lease losses.  Provisions assume a dire 5% unemployment scenario by EOY 2023, way above other banks.  Very conservative provisions.\n\n* If you look at their expanded investor presentation for 4Q call, they spent way longer than usual talking about their credit profile to provide investors maximum transparency. https://s2.q4cdn.com/753234398/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/4Q'22-Ally-Earnings-Presentation.pdf  75% is prime credit rating and 90% of all consumer loans are collaterized.\n\nSo it's not without risk but I believe they have good predictive analytics to give them an underwriting selection edge and stay on top of bad conditions as they come."

I remember arguing with u/apooroldinvestor back in November who was convinced this company would never go below $300.00 a share and I will say what I said then. This stock is the very definition of a bubble. \n\nThe valuation is absolutely egregious no matter what metrics you use. The company is priced beyond perfection. The company is trading over a 500 BILLION DOLLARS! That is about the same size if you were to take all the biggest semi-conductors like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instrument\u2019s, and Broadcom together and combined them! In what world does this make any sense to anybody? \n\nOn top of trading at high multiples they had earnings declines which a company priced to over perfection should not exist period. This company has a lot more to fall before I even consider touching it. Right now the only thing moving this stock is pure speculation cause its for sure not the fundamentals that is moving it. This stock is completely disconnected from any fundamentals. Up over 50% in just 2 months. \n\nNo thank you, staying away. I am leaving this to you u/apooroldinvestor and the other Nvidia fanboys."

Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors bubble this week. \\n\\nFed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovi'",

     "Well a very nice day for me. PSCE up 7%, XOM up 6%, AVDV up 1.5%, AMR up 4%, BTU 3%, and everything otherwise mildly green.\n\nAdded a sell limit order to Apple at $170 (just trimming).\n\nWhile I'm here, let me drop some charts (who cares about my portfolio). \n\n---\n\nLet me steal some content [from this great thread](https://twitter.com/TaviCosta/status/1642951113673699329). Why is 'this time different' for oil and gas stocks?\n\n- [Oil and gas companies have massively deleveraged](https://i.imgur.com/eUD8n9F.png) in the past few decades. There is more space to sustainably pay out dividends and do share buybacks, as a result. And do cap-ex.\n\n- [We are at the trough of the capex cycle](https://i.imgur.com/ced1WCL.png). Unlike in 2008, there is no decade of capital expenditures booming to lead to a sudden oversupply when demand falls. There is no savior and new supply will require new capex. In my recent [copper post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1288qre/copper_investors_are_demonstrating_the_bystander/), I gave a [similar graph](https://i.imgur.com/vHaQpT8.png). Check it out, there are a dozen graphs making the bull case for copper/commodities.\n\nFurther, as Costa points out, today we have the tailwinds of ESG mandates and much larger opposition to fossil fuels/mining *without the requisite supply alternatives or willingness to cut energy demand*.\n\nEdit: See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12aez60/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_apr_03_2023/jeu7g66/) with some graphs about the decline of US shale.\n\n---\n\nNext, I think the S&P Tech sector is becoming wildly overvalued. [Here is a great Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/CameronDawson/status/1642230860773466113) I sourced this content from.\n\n- We've seen YTD massive outperformance [by the tech sector](https://i.imgur.com/vMikXvO.png). (Tech +19.8%\nS&P +5.5%\nS&P ex-tech +0.62%)\n- While the [forward EPS growth's move lower, forward PE ratios spike](https://i.imgur.com/XlcMnHK.png). The 'B' stands for blended. Dawson writes, \"Tech forward PE is +25%  YTD, while Tech\u2019s 2023 EPS growth forecast has been cut from -2% to -8% YoY.\"\n- This is an [abnormally large](https://i.imgur.com/RTz0nqJ.png) premium to the S&P 500, \"even higher than at the pandemic bubble peak in late 2021!\" (Dawson).\n- [The PE ratio of tech](https://i.imgur.com/tu53IbO.png). (The previous plot shows the premium over SPY, while this is just the raw level).\n\nSo no, I'm not going to invest in the QQQ or add to my tech tilts. If anything, I shall continue to trim my tech positions ever so slightly and continue to target other sectors or broad index funds. Not that I think being short tech is advisable either, as our resident NVDA bear can attest.\n\n---\n\nFinally, I was beat to it, but GDP Nowcast was revised down yet again from 3.2% --> 2.5% --> 1.7%. Which seems far more reasonable of a forecast given the headwinds."

     "I need to post a write up on the transformation of Big Oil using Big Tech to become more lean & profitable.  I have been putting it off due to life and having too much to do and too little time.  However, I am one of those people that believe Oil is not going away in the lifetimes of anyone currently born on this world today. Here are 2 examples & 2 latest contracts awarded to Halliburton. \n\nHalliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) today announced that Petrobras will use the Landmark iEnergy\u00ae digital platform to address its subsurface challenges. The companies executed a contract that gives Petrobras access to the entire Halliburton Landmark DecisionSpace\u00ae 365 Geoscience Suite including cloud-based, next-generation technologies like Seismic Engine, Scalable Earth Modeling, Assisted Lithology Interpretation, DS365.ai, and Neftex\u00ae Predictions to support its strategic exploration and production programs.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-accelerates-digital-transformation-halliburton-124500953.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/petrobras-accelerates-digital-transformation-halliburton-124500953.html)\n\nHalliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) today announced that Hess Corporation (NYSE: HES) has selected Halliburton Landmark\u2019s DecisionSpace\u00ae 365 Well Construction applications powered by iEnergy\u00ae Hybrid Cloud to plan, design, and construct safe, cost effective, and productive wells.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hess-selects-halliburton-well-construction-124500676.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hess-selects-halliburton-well-construction-124500676.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of potential growth coming to oil service & equipment stocks.  I believe $HAL and $SLB are well positioned to move the oil & gas industry in the 21st century.   This is not including $HAL investment into Carbon Capture which I believe is going to be huge in the near future as the world changings it's rhetoric from eliminating the use of crude oil to a need to reduce the carbon footprint from the continuous use of crude oil."

Yes, even if you don't re-buy, you still lost on the gains you would have made if you didn't sell the call. If you opt to sell puts instead of re-buying you are once again betting against growth: if the market gain exceeds premium collected you've missed gains again (but the reverse is also true).\n\nCC/CSP strategies require a certain set of conditions to get good gains. **You need growth, but not too much. You need the expectation of volatility, but not the actual price volatility.** If the underlying drops more than your premiums, you lose money, if it gains past your strike more than your premiums, you also lose.

So, with NVDA trading at a multiple of 80, even if let's say they 3x their eps in the next 5 years which is an extremely absurd assumption as they've already had a ton of growth fueled from covid, they would have 9 dollars of EPS and looking at today's stock price, if it stayed the same they would still be trading at a mul\"",

Perhaps the market momentarily sells down or the ARM deal doesn't go through and the stock takes a hit. Then your puts pay off.

     "Lots of people seem to be complaining on how stuff is overvalued and what not. It seems likely to be true but the indexes are still off their highs. Look at what happened to Tesla from 2020-2021 and how it destroyed shorts and was exuberantly priced, same thing can happen with Nvidia and it can stay higher for longer. Markets can stay irrational longer than individuals can stay solvent. If someone regularly DCA's from their paycheck they get to average in the lows and the highs and general 30+ year outlook is that USA should go up or we have bigger problems. And we are NOT Japan... Also there is a strong possibility that high beta growth stuff was expensive before but got overshot to the downside and is just finding a reasonable floor, we don't really know.  I'm long but hedge, and my hedge from SQQQ from 2 weeks ago is down over 20% and my covered calls are near the money.

What this means now is that they can still make an announcement via 8K in this upcoming week (apparently they need to get 13 signatures physically signed), but they cannot start the actual buybacks until the earnings report is released end of April. There is a blackout period that starts April 1st. \n\nSome were hoping they would both announce the resolution and initiate buybacks before today, but it looks like that will have to wait. Patience will be key here.\n\nIt looks like BTU had large buying right before close today, likely in anticipation of big moves coming up. Quarter end selling might have also impacted today's price action at least early on (BTU is not an ESG name funds want to have on their portfolio). There will be selling pressure from Elliott Management looking to exit their position, but shareholder returns will likely bring in plenty of new buyers, including BTU itself, to bring stock price up. \n\nI'm roughly equally bullish on AMR/BTU, with the risk of BTU not executing on the capital returns making up for AMR having less upside."

I cant use VR at all because I get vertigo and know many other do. migraines too. so I thought Metaverse was doomed to fail from the get go. Anyway...\n\nGoogle have Deep mind, and have been in the game with powerful AI for a while, what trumped them is public access. ChatGPT was a master stroke in that regard and blew the lid off companies hording \"their precious\".\n\nI am in TQQQ on this, the reason is that AI big bois are propping up the markets but any one of them could take a tumble on a proper game-changing moment from leftfield. Ultimately it's the big names that will own AI, or buy it out, all else will be open source catching up. So open source is the place to look. but...\n\nThough its a bit like crapto post 2013, where it was almost impossible to pick winners, but if you threw enough at a bundle, one might moonshot. Its happening fast now , but the difference this time is the AI companies stock is not 0.001 cent, but already at >$200, so no one is jumping in.\n\nNVDA should have been predictable obvious one, and I am still seeing lots of investors poo-pooing it saying dont get in now , too expensive. But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. \n\nSame with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. \n\nmy view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.\n\nmeantime the biggest market yet to be breached imo is home robots. M3gan is the most insightful movie on this. Its way off though, the hype is not the truth with home robots yet. but AI first."

AI is still in very early stages.  The costs will come down dramatically to the detriment of Nvidia.  In 2007, it cost $10 Million to sequence a human genome; today it costs $200.

Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:  \\n\\n\\n* **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier. \\n* **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty.\\n* **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts.

     "I think we are in, how do you say, a bubble but a bubble with many smaller bubbles within in it. Sort of like a large bubble encasing many smaller ones. Anyone of these bubbles popping could cause a contagion effect. What is concerning is the fact this economy has been injected with cash from the actions due to the pandemic. Was injecting cash a good thing? Eh, hindsight is 20/20..am I right? Rhetorical of course, we simply don\u2019t 100% know. I do know many folks and businesses alike are using these funds, wages and savings to push up the market all while collecting money from these investments. Might be an explanation to where some of the missing work force went. It\u2019s very interesting using analytics and techniques to review market data but it\u2019s human behavior at the core. Right now everyone who has skin in the game are at best trying to find what will pop first. With so much fear and confusion it\u2019s like the fed thinks we need something familiar to happen in the market to know which way is up. IMO not gonna happen. This inflation is going to stick. Why? Too much money chasing too few goods. Slap the working force and unemployment goes up. Thing is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the working class with the money. So I see high unemployment and moderate inflation 4-5%, but a big demand in growth for services. So I\u2019ll call it Flowflation. Ew, how do we get out of this? Policy to detach from energy costs and dare I say it drop interest rates and some how get the rich closer to us in terms of income. I\u2019m also skeptical that something is lurking in the shadows of some heavy weight countries. That\u2019s my Ted talk thanks for reading \ud83d\ude4f"

It is a pure gambling machine based on technical analysis. \n\nhttps://talkmarkets.com/content/nasdaq-bitcoin-gold-among-beneficiaries-of-falling-rates-expectations?post=389768\n\nThis is an article that sends shivers down my spine. First this part:\n\n\"The market is thus betting that we have reached a peak in terms of rate hikes and that from here looser monetary policy should follow.\n\nThe Fed, SNB, and BoE all hikes interest rates this week, but the message from these banks was the same: more increases may be required, not will be if inflationary pressures persist.\"\n\nWhere on earth are people getting this idea? The Fed is doing something rather clever. They are providing liquidity at ever increasing rates. Meaning you can have money, but it will cost you. They are completely misunderstanding looser monetary policy.\n\nSecondly, the idea that you can read the market as an uptrend because of some technical analysis is ludicrous. Technical analysis works until it does not work, and then it does not work really badly. People have since 2008 only seen a market that goes up. That is scary as it implies we have a generation of \"investors\" that don't understand that markets can go down hard.\n\nIt will burst, but it will be death by a thousand cuts."

So the share price will go down 75% after June 21st since buying a share after that date no longer will get you 3 more shares, and all the shares are now diluted even though the additional shares will not be technically given out until July 20.\n\nJust like how a stock drops after the cash dividend ex date even if the cash won't be given out for another month.\n\nEdit: Idk what the downvote is for, this is the exact answer to the question...

     "First off, semiconductors have been a boom/bust industry forever. \n\nSecond, if China makes a move for Taiwan there will be so much interruption that whatever happens to semiconductors at that point would be peanuts in the grand scheme of things. \n\nLastly, comparing chip manufactures to chip designers is comparing hardware to software. Manufacturing hardware has high costs to participate/lower margins, about 3-4 choices if you want to produce at scale, and a moat that is all but impossible to cross for any new competition. Chip designers are basically just software companies that focus on chip design; they have low overhead/higher margins, practically no barrier to entry, and with that much fiercer competition. \n\nAs for your assessment, it seems to boil down to you believe the semiconductors manufactures and designers run in democratic countries are in a bubble that is about to pop because of war and overpriced shares, and this will lead to China having some sort of significant advantage. \n\nThe problem with that is the war has been going on for over a year and already has been heavily priced in, the shares for designers are not overpriced due to semiconductors themselves but due to fervor over AI, and China is heavily restricted from accessing the best methods and materials for producing semiconductors, so where is that supposed advantage coming from given the lack of access to the necessary resources? Also, it should be mentioned that we are likely close to the [bottom of the bust part of this cycle if history is any indicator,](https://i.imgur.com/nC3w0fz.png) so what makes you think we are in a moment worse than the Covid shutdowns, worse than the Global Financial Crisis, and worse than the dotcom bubble?"

     "I sell semis for a living.  I can tell you the downturn started mid last year for consumer products and it is just starting in automotive. I\u2019ve quoted lead times up to 104 weeks last year for some automotive qualified chips.  These LTs are now down to 26 weeks or so with a couple exceptions of Microchip and ST.  Microchip is always a mess.  This is a combination of adding capacity as well as lower demand.   For the most part suppliers who had the most success through the shortage had their own fabs and didn\u2019t use TSMC or other contract manufacturers.  That way they could concentrate on more popular products instead of when the order came in. Ironically Microchip has their own fabs.  The consumer world is the bulk of the chips and it is a completely different environment than automotive but automotive is still about 15-20% of global usage. Depending on who you ask.  Automotive requirements for chips have much more stringent testing parameters.  This is only growing with EV, chargers and regular ICE vehicles.  I expect to see that chunk of the pie grow more in proportion.   There could be a glut of semis in the next few years in some categories but I expect automotive may be the place to be when this happens as I don\u2019t think it will be as severe."

Plus their forward P/E is justified from their insane growth, which has been happening even despite the chip shortage. There is a high demand for their current products that will only grow and they are getting into CPUs now.

My idea was if we do get a pop, I was going to sell covered calls at the $70 strike price and if my shares get called away - I would then buy back in when MU does its inevitable fall back to lows $60s. For instance, If I can buy back in at $62, I could reduce my cost basis from $86 a share to $78 a share ($70-$62 = $8 per share reduced cost basis).  \n\nBecause I can not tax-loss harvest in a Roth anyway, I wouldn't have to wait 30 days or anything like that."

Continental, Hella, Sony and Valeo are also supplying sensors to Nvidia for the Hyperion 8.  \\n>  \\n>The opportunity here is that as Nvidias system gets designed in (to production vehicles), we also ultimately get designed in, said Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell.\\n\\nsource [https://tec'",

     "I don't think so.\n\nNVIDIA is expensive when it comes to corporate (and consumer too) accounts.  I learned this first hand when they stopped the Grid K2 support and put their new grid card onto a license based cost model.\n\nOne thing that many other car companies are learning from TSLA is vertically integration.  This is the main reason TSLA margin is so high and how TSLA was able to navigate the ship shortage much better (they re-wrote the code to use an alternative chip in a matter of weeks) than the rest of the auto companies.  They'll be less likely to farm out major systems of their cars to a third party vendor.\n\nIf company X wants the cameras and radars,  it will do directly to the source rather than paying another middle man.\n\nHere's a recent example:  TSLA wants to put more media contents/games onto its cars, it didn't try to integrate NVIDIA shield (use this as an example but it could have been XBOX,PS5 etc) into the cars but rather buy the chip (from AMD) and do the integration itself."

     "> but I'd argue that the hyper-growth side of the market has already experienced it's 2001-style reckoning. \n\nLook at the companies. Most are still far from cheap, and a lot of them are still very expensive. Not only have the loses of many increased, growth has slowed and now you have FFR of 5%. Given those backgrounds, it is a miracle that most of them are not down even more. \n\n>There is an absolute fuck-ton of money in money-markets, T-bills, and cash. People are bearish. I know we've just experienced quite a rally through Q1 but there are still many, many growth stocks that are down very low. We've had some very bad news recently with OPEC, bad jobs numbers, SVB, but - at some point - the market will begin looking past these things and start looking ahead. You could get in when it's more clear that conditions are improving - likely the safer bet - or you could start really digging to find potential value in the broken dreams of 2022 to catch the most upside.\n\nYou know why there is a lot of money there? Because they get 4-5% risk free rate. Why would you buy some random company that has loses or dilutes the hell out of shareholders, when you get an acceptable return without any risk or work. Furthermore money doesn't have to come back. Retail participation in Japan for example is still not back after the crash in 1989.\n\n>SOFI, DDOG, ENPH, WOLF, INVZ, CRWD, are a few. I've only opened small positions in a few of these because I'm a pretty cautious investor,  \n\nDo a DCF with 5% FFR and the growth decline in those companies. They are still very expensive."

Then boom.\n\nDon't get me wrong the risks now are real, too.  After 15 years of ultra-loose monetary policy there's bound to be hidden risks in the system, as we're seeing now.  And we definitely had our own little Covid bonanza.  But I don't think we ever shook off the lessons of '08, there was always a sense of \"not so fast\".  \n\nI dunno.

So for that reason, it's not right to say that this is another version of 2008.  Even if it becomes very bad, which we don't know yet, it's totally different.

     "Ben Felix recently had a video on international diversification that I recommend checking out. He does more than just repeat the mantra that past performance doesn't predict future performance, like many cases for international performance do. [Here is a recent Ben Felix Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/benjaminwfelix/status/1632884241145970690) summarizing his points. Let me give my qualitative summary:\n\n\n- You're better off geographically  diversifying *within* a single industry than diversifying across industries *within* a single country. \n- Although a large portion of the S&P 500 is composed of multinational firms with global revenue, there are *still* diversification benefits to owning international index funds. [And to add, you're missing out on foreign companies who benefit from US revenue flowing abroad]\n- The previous point is especially valid for subsectors like international small cap value (which I tilt via AVDV). The previous points claims that a company like Nestle or Novartis will add diversification benefits to existing US multinationals like Pepsi or Pfizer. But  highly insulated small caps around the world are even more uncorrelated to these US companies. Similarly, US small cap value stocks are useful in volatile moments because they are less exposed to foreign exchange shocks or geopolitical risk.\n- Much of the outperformance in US stocks is due to valuation changes as opposed to fundamentals. \n- Ben Felix wouldn't approve, but you can also make market timing arguments about the cheapness of international (and value and small cap) stocks. Ex-US stocks have substantially underperformed in recent years, so you're effectively buying the dip. There are also currency tailwinds since you can buy more with a strong USD.\n- Some might claim that ex-US stocks are cheap for a reason. The market timing case argues that they are not just cheap compared to US stocks, but that the discounts themselves are at historic levels. The same applies to small cap or value stocks, which are at the 98th percentile of cheapness. Yes, the UK/Japan/etc. will always trade at a discount to the US, will it always be *this* much of a discount? As previously mentioned, US stocks outperformed by getting more expensive rather than by out-growing  their EPS. Ex-US stocks have the reasonable EPS growth without the valuation premium.\n\nDiversifying will therefore increase your risk adjusted performance. \n\nIf you'd like to see actual statistics, articles, and figures, check out my previous posts:\n\n- Jan 2023: [Update to Euro/US macro](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/10izb7y/an_update_to_eurous_macro_situation_ft_eurozone/) along with a [bear case for the UK in particular](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10iymjh/an_update_to_eurous_macro_situation_ft_eurozone/j5hm7zk/).\n- Dec 2022: [Did Europe bottom?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zfhki1/did_europe_bottom_wsj_investors_see_shift_in/)\n- Oct 2022: [A case for small cap value](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y9xr61/theres_more_to_index_funds_and_stocks_than_vti/)\n- Aug 2022: [Valuation spreads are at historic extremes](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/wk4r76/market_timers_this_post_is_for_you_the_relative/).

     "u/Miko109 u/shortyafter u/Sad-Round8961\n\nI think Japan is evidence QE may possibly work at the zero lower bound without really bad inflation as a necessary consequence.  It seems reasonable critics of the Fed do not disagree with that.  \n\nWhat they object to is why do central banks have massive balance sheets way past the emotional panics that cause credit crunches?  Not only does there seem to be a lack of evidence of benefit for there to be so much extra liquidity, there seems to be a shifting of the demand curve for reserves.  As the banking system has larger reserves, it adapts, regulators adapt, and now we just need more liquidity.  Additionally there doesn't seem to be a good framework of how much reserves we are even supposed to \"optimally\" need.\n\nGeorge Selgin has stated in his working [paper](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-50-updated-3.pdf):\n\n>The Fed\u2019s actual interest on reserves policy resembles this last alternative, the difference being its use of subsidized interest on reserve payments instead of high mandatory reserve requirements to boost banks\u2019 demand for reserves. That difference makes the interest on reserves alternative less financially repressive in so far as, instead of exposing banks to a larger required reserve tax burden, it lowers that burden, allowing banks in turn to raise their deposit rates somewhat, instead of having to reduce them as they must when they\u2019re compelled to hold more non-interest-bearing reserves. Interest on reserves therefore has both \u201cincome\u201d and \u201csubstitution\u201d effects on financial intermediation, where the first increases its overall extent, while the second directs a larger share away from private borrowers and toward the Fed. An increased interest rate on both required and excess reserves will be financially repressive so long as the income effect is small relative to the substitution effect. Since the increase in banks\u2019 net interest income consists mainly if not solely of income earned on their (relatively modest) required reserve balances, and most studies suggest that the demand for bank deposits is not very interest elastic, that\u2019s almost certainly the case.\n\n>One of the most disconcerting features of the post-crisis recovery has been the \u201cgreat productivity slowdown\u201d that has accompanied it (Kravis 2017). Since the start of the recession in late 2007, labor productivity has grown at an average annual rate of just 1.1\npercent\u2014far below the 2.3 percent average growth rate between 1947 and 200. The growth rate of total factor productivity also fell below its pre-crisis trend, where it has remained ever since...San Francisco Fed economists Michael Redmond and Willem Van Zandweghe (2016, p.41) consider a reduced post-crisis supply of credit the \u201cprimary suspect\u201d in the post-crisis decline in U.S. total factor productivity, blaming it for having \u201cprevented [established] firms from investing in innovations\u201d and also for making it harder for new firms to enter the market (ibid, p. 39).\n\nThe central bank of Norway recognized this problem and got off the ample reserves framework in 2010, [stating](https://static.norges-bank.no/contentassets/cfc83348f4574a719dd5a4ce70a48840/consultative_document_06102010.pdf?v=03/09/2017123145&ft=.pdf):\n\n>When Norges Bank keeps reserves relatively high for a period, it appears that banks gradually adjust to this level\u2026With ever increasing reserves in the banking system, there is a risk that Norges Bank assumes functions that should be left to the market. It is not Norges Bank\u2019s role to provide funding for banks\u2026If a bank has a deficit of reserves towards the end of the day, banks must be able to deal with this by trading in the interbank market.\n\nThe ECB seems to be recognizing the dangers as well:\n\nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp230302~41273ad467.en.html\n\n>In the ongoing review of our operational framework, we are analysing whether in the future we will operate under a floor or a corridor system. We hope to conclude this review by the end of the year.\n\n>One important element in our discussion is the amount of central bank reserves required to effectively steer short-term interest rates in either a floor or a corridor system. This amount informs our decision-making as to when balance sheet normalisation might need to be halted. \n\n>Our current estimates suggest that the amount of central bank reserves currently held by the banking sector exceeds, by a significant margin, the level necessary to steer short-term market rates close to our key policy rate even under a floor system.\n\n>This implies that the current size of our balance sheet is larger than necessary to effectively implement our monetary policy stance. As such, maintaining a large bond portfolio absorbs valuable policy space that may be needed if policy rates were to become constrained again by the effective lower bound.\n\n>Shrinking the balance sheet, to the extent possible, is therefore both prudent and efficient.\n\n>The second reason for reducing the APP portfolio is related to the side effects of running a large balance sheet.\n\n>It is well documented that bond purchases can cause asset price valuations in financial and real estate markets to diverge from their economic fundamentals, thus raising both financial stability risks and wealth inequality.\n\n>Maintaining too large a balance sheet may also have undesirable side effects.\n\n>One is that it could jeopardise central bank\u2019s credibility by giving rise to accusations of financial and fiscal dominance.\n\n>A second side effect is that maintaining a larger balance sheet than necessary increases the Eurosystem\u2019s exposure to credit and duration risk. The probability and extent of net losses are significantly higher the larger the amount of long-term fixed-rate assets the central bank holds on its balance sheet.\n\nSo Japan seems like a reasonable data point for ZIRP, QE and their relationship with inflation.  But it doesn't say much about what we're supposed to do after ZIRP.  Moreover QE itself is still a massive experiment.  It's important to consider additionally that Japan is idiosyncratic with a dangerously low birthrate, ageing population, government price controls, as well as a deeply ingrained culture of resisting inflation."

     "Decided I want to reduce my portfolio allocation to individual stocks and reinvest the proceeds back into index funds. I got serious about investing at the end of 2021 and while I still want to devote a small portion of my portfolio to stock picks, I admit I got carried away and ended up holding about 35 different companies at one point. I've trimmed that down to 28 now, but I'm still wasting too much time stressing over earnings calls and company-specific risks. Currently I have about 40% of my portfolio in individual stocks but I'd like to cut that down to 20-25% by the end of this year, though I'll hold certain positions longer if I can avoid realizing losses or paying unnecessary taxes.\n\nAfter the recent mini-rally in tech I am now at break even or slightly positive on a number of stocks including ABNB, AMD, CRM, MSFT, MU, SPOT, and TTD. Seems like a good time to decide which of these tickers I should reduce exposure to, sell completely, or hold for the long term. I'm also bagholding others including UPST (-68%) and ZIM (-53%) which I'm not sure if I should just cut loose or hold and hope for better days (these were by far my worst picks at the valuations they were at).\n\nI'm done with stock picking going forward unless I have really strong conviction in a company or the risk/reward ratio is overwhelmingly in its favor giving it multibagger potential. Just wondering out loud trying to figure out my exit strategies at this point...tempted to just cut loose all the tickers I listed above at Monday open (together they make up about 10% of my overall portfolio). I'm not really trying to time the market, I just want more peace of mind by putting that money into index funds instead (though I'd likely DCA the proceeds over the next several months given the current market volatility)."

     "I didn't know this, but apparently the US economy entered recession (determined after the fact) before any of the major financial contagion (besides Bear Stearns) was happening. From [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MattZeitlin/status/1637076661823733761):\n\n> The interesting thing about the financial crisis is that the recession tuns out to have started ten months *before* lehman went bankrupt..\n\n> of course the financial stresses don't begin in september 2008, the bear stearns hedge funds collapse in june, 2007, there's the quant meltdown in august, but arguably the real economy was feeding into the financial sector then too, with the subprime market collapsin\n\n- Spring 2006: Housing market peaks\n-  Aug. 2006: Yield curve inverted\n- June 2007: Bear Stearns starts to collapse.\n-  Sept. 2007: Fed did first rate cut\n- Dec. 2007: The recession started in.  Unemployment 5%.\n- Feb. 08: First stimulus package\n- Mar. 08: Fed does emergency cut\n- Aug. 08: unemployment 6%\n- Sept. 2008: Lehman went bankrupt. AIG taken over. TARP vote fails.\n- Oct. 2008: TARP passes. Around now is when global stock markets really started crashing.\n- Dec. 08: 0% interest rates\n- Feb. 2009: Stimulus package passes. At this time, it was reported Q4 of 2008 real GDP fell 6.2% annualized.\n- Mar. 2009: Market bottoms\n- June 2009: Recession ends\n- Oct. 2008: Unemployment rate peaks at 10%\n\nOne difference with today is that the financial panicking is happening with Q1 2023 real GDP predicted to be 3.2% by Atlanta Fed, following 2022 growths of Q1 -1.6%, Q2 -0.6%, Q3 3.2%, and Q4 2.7%. I really don't associate Q1/Q2's negative figures with any of today's contagion."

     "I have a couple of questions about owning the same stock in a bunch of different accounts, some normal accounts, but others Roth and regular IRA.\n\n1. If I own shares of AAPL in a Roth IRA, regular IRA, and also a normal brokerage account, my question is... does the cost basis for the Roth IRA investment or the regular IRA investment have anything at all to do with the cost basis for the standard account investment? I mean in regards to taxes. For example, let's say my cost basis for AAPL was $170 in my \"standard\" brokerage account. But my cost basis in my Roth is $135, and my cost basis in my regular IRA is $141. The only thing that matters from a tax standpoint is the $170 right?\n\n2. Does the wash sale rule apply to purchases/sales in the Roth and regular IRA accounts? For example, let's say I sell my AAPL in my standard account right now, and it would be a loss. Then, a week later, I make a $7500 contribution to my Roth for 2023 and I buy AAPL for it's current price. Would this cause a problem?\n\n\nThe way I think about Roth and regular IRA transactions, is that they're in their own private ecosphere and they have absolutely nothing to do with anything outside of it. Their own private island. But maybe I'm wrong in assuming this."

     "There is an overall industry slowdown, although there are multiple markers involved and they are pretty different. The server market, consumer market, and mobile markets are pretty different. AMD is eating Intel's lunch and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future in the server market. That market is slowing down but it's not a major slowdown. In the consumer market Intel is competitive but with lower margins than AMD, this market is slamming into a wall. Intel is not in the mobile market. \n\nIn terms of the consumer market slowing down you can see that with DRAM manufacturers cutting production. Samsung just recently announced cuts and Micron has been cutting back for months now. Apple, HP, and Lenovo have also been hit pretty hard. \n\nServer market is key for AMD and Intel. AMD has the better product at a lower price point right now. AMD and Intel have aggressive roadmaps and AMD has a much better track record, but I wouldn't discount Intel at this point. They are much bigger and have significantly more resources than AMD at this point. \n\nIntel is also gearing up to compete with TSMC, not AMD in the future. Their fab build out plan is aimed at gaining business from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Apple. That's something important to consider. Realistically Intel is losing to TSMC, that's where Amazon, Google, and Apple are going. That's the big opportunity for Intel, working with the tech Megacaps."

I think they have the best in class product and based on the recent earning call I think the next 6-12 months sees major progress with OEMs and tier 1 clients.\n\nDo what's best for you, and don't blindly take advice on here. Do your research and make sure your comfortable with the risk"

Also I see some of your stocks pay dividends. Make sure you reinvest them. Finally, stay away from shady stocks like biopharma, they are very risky. You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term? It does pay great dividends but for the past several years has done nothing so although a stock like that may be good for an older investor looking for a steady dividend paying stock, at 19 it\u2019s not a good thing, you don\u2019t need dividends, you need growth.

This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex.

If you\u2019re basing off the innovations, a proven track record, steady cash flows, and potential for growth I would go with NVDA personally.

Based off my research by later that year I sold all the other tech stocks Including NVDA and bought loads of AMD. Well i didnot time the market correctly as NVDA went parabolic while AMD remain stagnant until mid 2018 but it eventually paid off. Gains from AMD are way more than NVDA % wise. AMD from here ca easily double or triple in span of 2-3 years. Lisa is guiding around 50% growth in H2 and that is without the revenues from next generation consoles.\n\nI think NVDA is done for the year at least. They made bad bet on Turing, didnt account for crypto burst (AMD managed that well plus they have  diversified portfolio) plus their datacenter market is under threat from lots of players like Intel, Xilinx, AMD, Google etc. Autonomous driving remains pretty flat. Gaming is slowing down and that is without any high end competitive GPU from AMD. Intel is also developing GPU. Assuming if they are able to make competitive GPU (highly likely) lower discrete graphics will pretty much be dead as DDR-5 become mainstream in APUs."

Before doing *anything*, the first question is, \u201cwhat is the best use of that capital?\u201d Do you expect the positions to underperform the market by enough to justify eating the long term cap gains hit? Would you be more bothered by being wrong moving the funds before another run up, or failing to move the funds before a drop? \n\nMy personal yardstick is this: if profits beat about 15% annualized rate of return after the long term cap gains hit, I\u2019m out. I\u2019ll never be mad at a position beating the market average. Your views may differ."

     "Ive just been researching NVDA this morning so I have an updated idea. Their growth is expected to slow down for the next couple years so the recent drop was justified. With a decrease in earnings growth you should expect wall street to give a decreased valuation which is what we have seen with the earnings multiple dropping to about 20. \n\nWith the current growth forecast I dont see this as a bargain, but rather a fairly priced company if not overvalued. The reason you saw NVDA run so well the past 5 years was due to averaging about 40% yoy growth, and since growth is expected to diminish the P/E came down to reflect that.\n\nWhen the company's past performance was similar to its current projection we consistently saw a valuation of about 15 P/E. If we see this reversion to the mean once again then NVDA is overvalued still and you should expect this stock to underperform. From my point of view I would stay clear of this stock at its current price. "

The issue with this is that there are currently not enough RT cores to perform the calculations for pathtracing, meaning that the shader unites are bottlenecked by the RT cores so we observe a massive decrease in performance. With the next launch of Nvidia cards (not the refreshes), I would guess there would be at least a doubling in RT cores, however the primary issue with this is that their implementation of raytracing will be obsolete because of consoles. The next generation of consoles which are powered by an AMD apu will have raytracing, however the hardware will not be fix function, furthermore, it will be an open standard similar to DX12 meaning that vastly more games will be able to easily implement raytracing. This is a major issue with Nvidia because their hardware will not be as well optimized for these games, meaning lower performance. Furthermore, because they touted raytracing as their new schtick they cannot remove it the following generation as that would be admiring defeat, causing backlash in stock prices. Tensor cores for the most part are never used unless upsampling or for very specific rendering tasks, so on consumer GPUs, they are never used. These two factors have lead to Nvidia having enormous die areas, for example, the 2070 super has a die area in excess of 520mm2. When we compare this to what the die are of AMD\u2019s Navi GPUs, we see that they are a little less that half the size at roughly 250mm2, this means that even taking into account the node shrink, the Navi GPUs are roughly 30% smaller. Smaller die sizes are much cheaper as yield are better, meaning that they can have a larger profit margin at a lower price. Furthermore, Nvidia dig themselves into an even deeper hole with the ludicrous 1200$ MSRP of the 2080ti. This astronomical price lets AMD scale their GPUs up to 650mm2, handily beating Nvidia, and even put on HBM2E memory to add more efficiency and more bandwidth becomes a possibility. Nvidia\u2019s compute cards are not looking good either because they are so expensive that companies are starting to simply make their own ASICs (ei: Tesla) or turning to AMD with their Vega solutions. Vega is a very good computer card, and with not getting into too much detail about how the architecture works, we could see a Vega card with 128 compute unites, twice as much are Vega frontier cards.\n\nAMD is not Nvidia\u2019s biggest threat though. Intel is. Currently intel is getting dominated in the CPU space, and will not make a proper recovery until earliest 2021 (with current timelines and leaks). However, they recently spent 18b on consumer GPUs. To give some context, Turing costed roughly a billion over the course of 5 years. Intel just spent 18x that amount and they have some very smart people, meaning that their GPUs will be monsters in terms of efficiency. Not too many details are known about the Intel SKUs, however when we look at some of their earlier APUs, we see that even when Intel was not focusing on GPUs, they made incredible chips as seen in Ivy-bridge.\n\nThat's just my two cents of what we could see with NVIDIA, I simplified a lot of aspects of their architecture and what Intel and AMD have."

     "Couple of points: \n1. Your argument of low latency = SoC = ARM superior doesn't make sense to me. Having an SoC for lower latency purposes is just as possible on x86 - for instance, AMD recently announced an ability for clients to connect their own chip designs directly to the Infinity Fabric die, achieving super low latency, while not having to redesign the rest of the CPU side.\n\n2. Can you explain more clearly why you think NVDA is better positioned than INTC or AMD, or anyone else to profit from a possible shift to ARM? You make a lot of good points in the paragraphs prior then just jump to 'nvda will benefit from these' without explaining why.\n\nPersonally, my view is that x86 will continue to dominate the server/HPC side, while 'mobile' - or even non-mobile, consumer devices (think consoles) will shift to ARM and get their data from the HPC. Outside of a few extremely niche use cases in HPC (which, again, I don't see yours as one of from what you've described), x86's inherent advantages over ARM suggests to me any replacement isn't going to happen anytime soon."

If anything, it could be a (very) small benefit since when lowering guidance companies tend to be more conservative.\n\nOverall, I think you are right though.  Holding on to my shares since I am still bullish long term, but would be careful timing options around earnings."

     "1. I already made my comment, that only the retailers make more money with the increase in MSRP price.  so right there your analysis is broke.\n\n2.  Can't comment, but obviously slow sales will impact...its not like they just stopped all sales.  When a new card comes out and it is faster than the 1080ti mining may pick up slightly. Although Cyrto seems to be changing, it won't be as crazy as it was.\n\n3.  Gigabytes other months were up YOY.  They are also up 25&#37; YOY. They also dropped negative for the month in February, -4&#37;.  Also, how much of that is GPU related not their other segments?  It could be worse...  Again, obviously sales will drop imo, it is unsustainable.  We will see how next months drop is as well. \n\n4. I would also add the 300k gpu return is beyond strange....I mean how would a company miss step with that much of a messed up order and how do they get to return them?  I am not saying it is false, but why would just ONE AIB company do it?  something is up with this one. Maybe all OEM returned 300k but I still don't see why unless they were told to start working on a new card for the new GPU.  Pascal still sells well....if prices drop they will continue to sell.  So many people want to upgrade and not many people have a 1070 or greater GPU....percentage wise 70&#37;+(estimate) would be upgrading if they got a 1070.  Those numbers favor nvidia.\n\nIMO Nvidia is just milking pascal, slowing down advancement, sadly. I think this helps them financially, although I loathe it as a gamer.  Basically still making money on a product that should have been replaced already...for the gamer segment.  IMO their focus has been to increase revenue in other areas and that is where the majority of their work has been going(data, AI, Cars(which is still very small).  Although, PC gaming continues to increase and gaming is now the biggest form of entertainment...it will only continue and the backbone of gaming is GPUs.\n\nSome reasonable points, but WAY too extreme.  It is clear what you want to happen, imo.  "

Then when they are older... index investing EACH and every month in an asset allocation that makes sense to them.  \n\nThey LITERALLY don't even need to understand anything about what a stock even mean to be worth millions in their 50's if they just do the above.

Dividends are a plus but not necessary for every stock or company. then, pick a handful of stocks from different sectors and go from there."

     "I remember people having this exact discussion about Apple when it crashed in the dotcom bubble. Everyone was saying the end is here in 2007 summer during the crash then. And low and behold, the iPhone comes out and the stock destroys the market for a 10 year sprint.  \n\n\nNvidia is in that 2007 summer right now. The trend is AI, autonomous driving. There is no competition worthy of the infrastructure and brand that nvidia has, much like Apple right before the smartphone boom. It really is so simple and no need to overcomplicate things - Nvidia open sourced it's artificial intelligence so that no one else can muscle into the market they are building. They ARE the market. Deep learning, AI, image processing, server accelaration.... all of it is Nvidia. AMD will be growing too, but I prefer owning market leaders.  \n\n\nJust stop looking at the monthly stock moves. In 2025 you will be filthy rich.  "

How AI and IoT will affect the chip industry remains to be seen, but for now thier consumer grade hardware makes up a large portion of profits. Nvidia is still miles ahead of AMD GPU's as of right now but Intel was on that pedastal just a few years ago, and we've all seen how fast that status quo can change. And thier gamble on Ray Tracing (rtx) dosen't seem to be something mainstream consumers will catch on.\n\nOn a side note, I don't know much about AI but it dosen't seem like GPU parallel processing is super useful in applications that require alot of flexibility, something that AI tech needs.

     "Casual Hypothesis I haven't put too much thought into. Interested in opinions:\n\nThe weakening big tech labor market means that a surplus of software engineering talent will now be more accessible to non-tech businesses that desperately need more tech investment. Examples: airlines (SouthWest after this month's fiasco), big banks (who need to do what the new fintech kids on the block are doing), healthcare, ...\n\nTo focus in on fintech, I always didn't really like the space because a lot of the bull cases relied on the company being a 'one stop shop' or having a 'nice app interface'  or 'innovative machine learning algorithms' which are certainly things the cash-flush big banks can do if they choose to make the investment in it. If banks are able to step up their spending on tech investments, I think this presents a major bear case for the various fintech companies that rode the 2021 craze. Not to mention the huge amount of competition. Upstart, Affirm, SOFI, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Stripe, Square, Klarna, Intuit, Visa, Mastercard, Finastra, PaySafe ... [I'll be honest I couldn't list all the fine details about most of these, but they all appear to provide services banks can do]"

As an example, last friday I was only up 1%. \\n\\nOn a previous day when the market was acting volatile, I was beating the Indicies when it went down, but again, not as much when it went up.\\n\\nI look at my portfolio and am puzzled. I own majority of large caps like APPLE, BX, Delta, Visa etc.. plus mid/small caps that have done well. I do relatively decent, but is it really a question of just owning these stocks that go up 10% in a day such as UPST, NVDA etc.. and just deal with it when they go down a lot? \\n\\nI am getting seriously discouraged and may just go into index funds.'",

     "I don't think you realize the chance of you beating the market is really, really, really low.  I am not going to try to dissuade you or others, but will link at the bottom the data.  It comes from JPM own Private Banking arm to their own dismay.  In they looked at ALL the individual stocks from 1980 to their publication date 2014 so >30 years.  It showed over that time period the MEDIAN return of all stocks during that time was -53%.  Yep, that is NEGATIVE 53%.  Well what is the chances of finding the next multibagger?  Well the chances of finding a stock that will 5x the index is only 7% of all stocks.  So VERY unlikely.  Every major study that has been done (BHB and BSB) has shown active management (picking stocks and/ or market timing only LOSES money vs. just sticking to your asset allocation.  The ongoing SPIVA and DALBAR studies show over and over and over again the same that active management loses money over the index.  \n\nSo if you are going to be a active investor you have to accept you will be a loser in the end.  Sorry but that is going to be the end story.  You will be poorer.  Folks either get it and go passive and become richer or they don't and stay active and end up poorer. \n\n https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/eotm-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy.pdf"

I think I would buy if it < 100 billion market cap, but where is the avenue to raise fcf without raising subscription prices?\n\nDoes anyone know how much more money they will make if they go after password sharing?\n\nAdvertising was a good move imo by Netflix.  They should set up merchandising and make a serious bid into gaming.  I think it would be cool if Netflix had a tv remote that could turn into a gaming controller.  The games don't have to be complicated - simple indie games so that parents can pass the buck and raise their kids on Nflx.  \n\nThey are also the only steaming service that actually makes money - indicating streaming is hard and maybe making it a good moat."

There is a major catalyst coming up in the next few weeks which could see huge upside (debt covenants getting released --> shareholder returns). And downside if management does something stupid.\n\nI had also bought AMR (met coal) recently and am already up some 12% so reluctant to keep on adding. Coal Twitter seems to be taking profits on AMR although noting it is still relatively cheap.\n\nI'll make a post about coal, but basically the bull thesis for the next few years isn't that prices are going to be absurdly high like earlier this year, but that the 'new low' is a lot higher. If you look at forward curves for thermal or met coal pricing into 2023/2024, they are still very high. Given that these coal companies are priced cheaply even at those prices, they are a pretty good deal, although not the multi-baggers they once were.\n\nAs a side note, hang out on Twitter and check out the Spaces. You can get some fantastic DD from people in the industry or major investors talking about their bull or bear cases. For example, yesterday I was listening to a guy in Australia talking about the shortages of coal thanks to floods."

I've been following the release of the RTX 30 series quite closely, and as many of you probably know the supply has been extremely limited. I think that the people that want to upgrade their GPU or build a PC will postpone this until they can get their hands on one of these cards because they are better and cheaper than the previous generation. If you don't need your new GPU that urgent, you will probably wait until there is more stock available. Is anyone else concerned about this? Recent tech earnings have been punished heavily in the market for not performing well. I think that NVDA might plummet when they report that GPU sales have been down for the last 2 months.\"",

With that frame of reference, Nvidia's fundamentals were pressured by a slowdown in gaming, crypto-mining and the broader personal computer market. However, on the backdrop of the ChatGPT tailwind, NVDA stock has started to rebound aggressively, reflecting investor optimism about the potential of generative AI technology.\\n\\nWhile I acknowledge the tailwind that Nvidia is likely to see from AI computing, I also argue that the thesis remains speculative, given the early stages of the technology. Moreover, investors should consider that the market is already pricing lots of optimism--with NVDA shares valued at a FWD EV/EBIT of close to x60.\\n\\nNvidia is scheduled to report Q4 2022 earnings on February 22nd, and I assign a 'Hold' rating pre-announcement.\"",

You people should start noticing how the companies make money and not just their P/E or how much they fell YTD.\n\nNvidia will also fall more because of China sanctions, Ethereum switching to proof of stake and global recession ahead. The stock was crazy overvalued after the massive rally post Covid (which I have contributed and made lots of money, but I sold everything months ago).\n\nI don't see much upside from Apple, IMHO the stock will underperform the market in the next 5 years. It's a huge, mature company right now with limited growth potential.\n\nMicrosoft is definitely the best one among those because of their cloud business, their Microsoft Office business (which is extremely resilient even in a recession because companies can't function without it) and their expansion into gaming with Activision Blizzard acquisition. They are also active (and expanding) in some professional software for data management which can net good money in the future. Of course Microsoft is also a huge, mature company but it has more room to grow than Apple. And it's safe even in a recession because their revenue are more recession proof compared to Google, Nvidia and even Apple (which sells to consumers for the most part)."

That is, every team works on their own project without much feedback or communication between teams.  No real product road map to speak of.  Plus, many of these teams have \"Not Invented Here\" mentality which has lead to a serious duplication of work.  In the last decade they have launched nearly half a dozen operating systems.  Another example would be Google Stadia's, which ran on a Windows compatibility layer on Linux, did not use any Wine or Proton code what so ever.  The engineers justification for doing so was so they could learn how compatibility layers work.  \nBecause they clearly do not have a road map, and siloed internally they lack a clear vision for the company.  Hopefully someone eventually comes in and makes these changes because while it may be profitable, it's clearly not run very well at all."
