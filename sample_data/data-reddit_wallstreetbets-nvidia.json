     "\\~0.3% of the ETF's outstanding shares lol\n\nMostly playing with gains from previous plays. Likely gonna chuck another 10k or 20k to get the position size to $200k sometime soon.\n\n___\n\n**Current NVDA stats:**\n\n* Currently trading at $229.65 per share, $567B market cap\n* Up +60% YTD, +112% from 52-week lows hit in Oct 2022\n* Analysts median price target: $265\n* Analysts ratings: 26 Buy (63.4%), 13 Hold (31.7%), 2 Sell (4.8%)\n* Short-interest: 1.57%\n\n**Condensed DD/Brief Thesis:**\n\n* Nvidia is at a $567B valuation with a 131 P/E.\n* It's P/E is far greater than it was during any period of time in it's history. Well above anything that occurred during ZIRP. For reference, it's current P/E is >30% higher then it's 2021 peak (\\~100 P/E) hit in Nov 2021. A period where equities across the board were hitting sky high P/E valuations, GPU's were flying off the shelves, crypto hit an all-time high of $2.9T, and rates were 0%.\n\nThis suggests it's being modeled for extreme growth, but:\n\n* The Inflation Reduction Act dramatically [increases Nvidia's tax liability](https://tax.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CAMT-estimate.pdf) starting in 2023, due to a new 15% Corporate AMT. Nvidia has paid 1.9% effective tax or less in recent years, even having a negative annual tax (-$0.187B) for 2022. Among the lowest in the S&P 100.\n* Revenue & earnings have been going down significantly while operating expenses are rising. From their most recent Q4 earnings:\n\n|Revenue|\\-21%|\n|:-|:-|\n|Expenses|\\+27%|\n|Gross Margin|\\-2.1 pts|\n|Operating Expenses|\\+50%|\n|Operating Income|\\-58%|\n|Net Income|\\-53%|\n|Cashflow from Operations|\\-55%|\n|Free Cash Flow YoY|\\-53%|\n\nEven if the bullish analysts forecasted revenue growth projections (\\~18-20%) for 2023 became true, Nvidia will not make more revenue in 2023 than they did in 2021. Let alone earnings, due to increased operating expenses and taxes.\n\n* High rates act against spending growth, and make the equity-risk premium less attractive as bond become a viable alternative.\n* Failing banks in the tech (Silicon Valley Bank) & crypto (Silvergate) space disproportionately impact their primary customer base. Lack of available capital in growth tech point towards a reduction in spending."

Their gaming revenue, which I believe still beat, is just a small part of their total revenue.\n\nThis is why a wide moat is good.\n\nAlso, the entire PC community hates this new 4060ti's specs for the price, but again, gaming might as well not even be NVDA's focus at this point. It's all about making chips for AI for businesses."

Here is the kicker, not all AI tech companies will benefit, MSFT and AMZN have to spend more than they expected now, MSFT and others will not allow NVDA to dominate this hardware space longer term and will quickly \u201cbuild their own\u201d.   They already started.  Look at how fast MSFT built MS-Teams and then outpaced the company Slack.  So do you think NVDA has an insurmountable moat that justifies current growth rates like this for longer that 2023/2024?    NVDA needs to be at over 30b per quarter sustained to come close to looking reasonable from a Market cap perspective.  In addition, you think other chip companies will get these kinds of growth rates during this time?    Short answer, No!   AI is too hyped already."

I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t think any chipmaker is special enough to corner the market forever.\n\nI don\u2019t see it talked about enough, but can anyone comment on Nvidia\u2019s intellectual property? Is their software sticky enough that their clients will not consider alternative hardware *at any price delta*? Is there something so unique and patented about their hardware that competitors will be forced to license the tech from NVDA to offer an alternative product?"

     "The chips used in AI are no magic. It\u2019s not that Nvidia has a design that could not be replicated by someone else. \nThey manufacture most of them at TSMC, meaning they pay a premium to allocate high end processes there. \nSimilar to Apple, relying on the most advanced technology to produce their custom chips. \n\nI doubt the cloud AI partnership. Offering these big machine learning farms is an investment risk and might have short product cycles, depending on the evolution of ML hardware design. \n\nBoth Amazon and Google and certainly Microsoft as well focus very heavily on optimizing their data centers regarding power consumption and cooling. I personally cannot imagine they will suddenly buy billions of NVidia chips. \n\nPersonally I also don\u2019t like to call it AI, but stick to machine learning. \nNothing we have seen hyped up has a big commercial roadmap. \n\nPlease read that again. Yes, everyone is hyped up about machine learning and training big models, creating art, optimization in product design,  but you need to be able to sell these services. \n\nIn my opinion Nvidia is way too optimistic here. Not because it\u2019s not impressive technology, but creating a business model that allows them to penetrate cloud offerings or even consumer products. \n\nThey will eventually succeed, but not in the ways currently predicted. \n\nPeople forget companies like Nokia, Research In Motion or even Enron. \nGreed, limits in innovation and high expectations can kill the revenue of a company very very quickly. \n\nNvidia is great, but current market evaluations are a fantasy. \nJust my opinion."

According to DigiTimes, TSMC plans to increase its CoWoS capacity from 8,000 wafers per month to 11,000 wafers per month by the end of this year and aims to reach around 20,000 wafers per month by the end of 2024. However, even with this expansion, it is anticipated that Nvidia will consume approximately half of the capacity available at that time. AMD is also reportedly seeking additional CoWoS capacity for next year.  \\n>  \\n>The growing demand for technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC) is driving the adoption of complex multi-chiplet designs, exemplified by products like AMD's Instinct MI300 and Nvidia's H100. Nvidia, in particular, is considered the primary beneficiary of the increasing demand for AI-focused compute GPUs and currently con\"",

The only way it could get toppled is if Intel actually does a MSFT and had a project in the making take insane leaps and bound (like ChatGPT) and become the forefront of it. Otherwise, unlikely to see NVDA have a fall of grace.\n\nWill there be a correction to its stock value sometime in the future? **ABSOLUTELY!** Will it collapse from market leadership like BlackBerry?

Yea yea, little billy can play the latest AAA game on 8k resolution but that is the small shit to keep you in the dumpster behind Wendys.\n\nThe real story is who are at these meetings, how many industry leaders and government representatives are there? Spoiler alert, system integrators that develop shipping, defense, geospatial, etc solutions. And all that stuff is only getting better with Machine Learning. Nvidia knows this and that is why they're not really selling to people that buy a 3060Ti so they can play burger flipping simulator. They sell to people that buy BUILDINGS full of A550s because they need to do crazy deep learning shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Disclaimer - I am a long-term bag holder that is too chicken shit to buy puts on Nvidia.

I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regards opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.\\n\\nSo Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.\\n\\nIt's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's \"",

Let's look at some recent news and why we should keep our diamond hands ready.\\n\\nNvidia had an absolute barnburner of a year in 2023. The share price has more than doubled, with the company's market valuation hitting an astronomical $940bn (760bn). After a fantastic early trading session that saw the share price rise by 25%, the stock topped out at $385.84 a share. Nvidia is riding the wave of AI demand, specifically for generative AI products like ChatGPT, which require massive data centers packed with their semiconductor chips.\\n\\nNvidia recently reported Q2 revenues of $7.2bn, smashing Wall Street's predictions by 10%. The company also made an ambitious forecast of $11bn in revenues for Q3, which is more than 50% higher than Wall Street's estimate of $7.2bn. Matt Bryson from Wedbush Securities sa\"",

     "For anyone else like me who only understood 50% of that tweet masquerading as an article, especially this sentence: \"The mixed shelf will include shares of its common stock, preferred  stock, warrants, debt securities and purchase contracts, the company  said.\"\n\nBasically they're offering stock stock and more stock and I honestly don't know what the effective difference is for warrant vs stock vs purchase contract or how a debt security really works but here are the definitions sourced from investopedia.\n\nWarrants: Warrants are a derivative that give the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security\u2014most commonly an equity\u2014at a certain price before expiration. The price at which the underlying security can be bought or sold is referred to as the exercise price or strike price. An American warrant can be exercised at any time on or before the expiration date, while European warrants can only be exercised on the expiration date. Warrants that give the right to buy a security are known as call warrants; those that give the right to sell a security are known as put warrants.  \n\nDebt Security: A debt security is a debt instrument that can be bought or sold between two parties and has basic terms defined, such as the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and maturity and renewal date.\n\nPurchase Contract: A sales and purchase agreement (SPA) is a binding legal contract between two parties that obligates a transaction to occur between a buyer and seller. SPAs are typically used for real estate transactions, but they are found in other areas of business. The agreement finalizes the terms and conditions of the sale, and it is the culmination of negotiations between the buyer and the seller."

Without even considering the other top 99 companies, Apple alone is worth more than the entire FTSE100 companies combined. Your economy is a powerhouse of innovation, determination and worth ethic.\\n\\nYou enjoy globally dominated companies like Apple, Microsoft, Visa, Mastercard, Nvidia just to name a few. Mean while the UK has dog shit oil companies and banking companies on the verge of bankruptcy. I cannot remember the last time the UK produced a multi billon pound company. I think it was ARM Holdings, way back in 1990?\\n\\nSo my question is simply why can't the UK produce technological juggernauts like the US can? We have some of the best universities in the world yet we don't produce hardly any good companies.\\n\\nI just want to know why...\"",

Secondly, the UK economy is more focused on services and finance than manufacturing and technology. And finally, Silicon Valley in California has been hugely successful in attracting top talent from around the world, while London (the closest equivalent in Europe) hasn't been able to replicate that success."

And all of those schools do joint work with with the private sector and federal government.\n\nI\u2019d also add the US military to the discussion. We spend something like a hundred billion per year on R&D just in defense spending. Obviously aerospace and ship building industries benefit the most, but there are still billions of dollars going into things like AI, material sciences, even biotech every year through the military.\n\nAnd then there is the global reserve currency benefit we enjoy, which helps facilitate trade deals.\n\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s just a giant positive feedback loop."

     "Honestly... I think your university rankings are a bit... shall we say inflated?  Not that it isn't also the case for certain US universities (e.g. I'm not sold on Harvard being all they're talked up as either).  Juggernaut companies aren't just a matter of a strong education pipeline though... I suspect it has more to do with the regulatory environment.  \n\nThe US is far more tolerant of monopolies than they really should be (compare how the US and the EU treated Microsoft's browser shenanigans, the UK was in the EU at the time).  They also let them get away with more legal damage for much longer... to the point where it runs away from them and they couldn't put the cat back in the bag even if they wanted to.  Often by exploiting seemingly grey areas like Uber does with whether someone is a contractor or an employee.  This is something that I was seeing rulings on in the UK maybe even a decade earlier and those rulings were generally coming down on the side of them being employees.  And as far as I can tell from a quick search, that was upheld when it came to Uber as well: \n\n\"**Uber now treats all 70,000 of its drivers in Britain as \u201cworkers\u201d**  entitled to a minimum wage, holiday pay and pension plans. It comes  weeks after the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling that its drivers  were workers, not independent contractors.Mar 18, 2021\" --quoted from my Google search results, Google implies it comes from this article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html)\n\nIt's probably for the best that the UK doesn't produce mega companies (at least in the interest of the average UK citizen).  In the US, people still suffer heavily even from monopolies that were supposedly broken up at the time.  Even after Bell System was smashed in 1984, the separated companies operated regionally, effectively leaving local monopolies.  And to this day the US appears to be fairly unique in the cooperation between device manufacturers and retailers with phone companies to lock customers into long term phone contracts at purchase with strange financing options.  E.g. you cannot buy an iPhone at Best Buy without signing a cell phone contract.  You have to go direct to the Apple store to get one without contract in the US (or slightly shady methods, unlocked imports on Amazon, eBay phones that who knows..., etc.).  This level of anti-competitive operation is mostly not legal in the UK and EU.    \n\n\nLikewise, when these companies go overseas, they often have US government support even when they operate in ways that aren't normally locally legal.  Less egregiously (maybe?) these days, but the term Banana Republic refers to governments beholden to US firms operating in South America (Honduras, Costa Rica,...).  Of course British companies were able to operate that way back in the days of the British Empire, but these days the UK has less political and economic weight to throw around in that respect.  The British and Dutch East India companies started as local monopolies and again, benefited from the projection of power globally.  Mega companies require political buy in to have favorable policies and procedures through regulatory capture.  More robust political involvement and stronger regulatory authority and independence would be expected to put a damper on such massive enterprises."

Then of course there will be competitors but not in a few years. AI is not a bubble. It will only get bigger. If you are skeptical, you have no idea what countries around the world are doing to get ahead of this AI boom. Countries want their own factories. But they still need to import spinning jennys for now because it is more efficient to buy them than to develop them.'",

     "The problem is not that NVDA doesn't have a viable product, or that NVDA doesn't have one of the biggest moats in the history of technomoats. The issue is that their valuation leaves them precariously overexposed to a market drop.\n\nLook at Intel in the years 1999 - 2000. We would need a big market catalyst to drop the price quite a bit, but in such a case, they would slough like crazy.\n\nIntel actually had a significantly (and relatively over time) lower PE ratio is 1999, https://www.fool.com/archive/dripport/1999/06/04/intel-ligent-valuation-drip-port-june-4-1999.aspx, but doubled in 2000 on the bubble, and then popped back down to 20 after the crash.\n\nAll the while, they had a solid tech moat. Making CPU chips that others couldn't make, and while all the other companies that were buying Intel chips either went bankrupt, or otherwise decreased demand, Intel survived due to incredible footwork in fast shifting winds. Well, and again, because they had the same moat that NVDA has now.\n\nThis isn't a call to stock up on NVDA puts. No clue how this market will go. Anyways, NVDA is a mature growth company. \n\nFor all intents and purposes, NVDA is a company with its feet firmly planted, yet they have a barely realized market and 20 years of a head start. Nobody (in the business world at least) thought that graphics cards would ever be used by anyone besides glorified dungeons and dragons fans.\n\nI'm not sure Nvidia even knew about the potential. You could say they were quite lucky, because they've developed these cards with one competitor who targeted cheap cards, while they targeted advancement while nobody was watching, which put them in the perfect position to dominate AI (again, who knew a GPU would be used for AI in 2000?). \n\nSpurred by crypto miners, they fleshed out the number systems they could use for computations. It's almost this perfect storm, and an insatiable desire to be the very best that has put them in the position they are in. I'm not talking about the market. I'm talking about them as a company which makes a product. They just keep coming up with the best solutions, that put them into positions to capitalize on unforeseen opportunity. \n\nSomebody must've had a good fortune cookie.\n\nIt's not necessarily the same thing as Intel.\n\nBut nonetheless, if the market turns, you better believe NVDA puts will print and somebody out there will probably gobble up a literal fortune.\n\nBecause anyways, Intel's AI processing is not that terrible compared to Nvidia. In fact, it's marginally cheaper to run a full AI training set as far as energy goes, just so... unbelievably slooooow compared.\n\nBut do we genuinely see a big drop happening? Do we actually have an incorrectly leveraged market right now? Or maybe, could investor choices change rapidly? For example, if war broke out and America was directly involved, would big time investors still want to keep as much money in this stock?\n\nHonestly, what I see happening is a huge surprise on the earnings to come from here, so that the price to earnings ratio will be quickly justifi- well... less unjustifiable - back in the orbit of our solar system at least.\n\nI don't care if I'm wrong either way prediction wise, other than to say, I like the tech, bro.\n\nWill the price go down in the meantime? I wouldn't be surprised, but remember, the market can remain irrational far longer than you can remain solvent. Maybe some of that extrinsic rationale will become a bit more of a rational valuation. \n\nOr at least, AI AI AI AI AI AI AI"

There's a reason a company like Nvidia is riding this hype train, and the hype being there in the first place is deserving in some capacity, but that does not mean it should be worth over a trillion dollars. Such an obscene amount of money! Arguably no company should, but if you look at the other companies in the club, at least they make sense.\n\nEven if you would counter with the fact that our ideas of what proper valuations are may be outdated (a P/E > 25 being the benchmark is extremely outdated and myopic) this is obviously a hype train. If you invested right now, you're probably betting more so on the idea that more people will keep buying than you are that it will continue to accumulate value, even if those are \"technically\" the same idea.\n\nThe only rebuttal I would accept is a comparison to Tesla, in the sense that people will be so bought into the idea of Nvidia being valuable that the actual valuation won't matter, even though it's absurd by every metric out there, and that people will just keep buying regardless of the valuations.

     "> Nvidia is the only company that can make the spinning jenny for now.\nThey don't even own the factories - they rely on TSMC like everyone else, so they're bidding with Cloud Providers and that will eat their margins.\n\nThis stuff is so easy to make and software is portable, so everyone has it. Just look at AMD, Cloud TPUs (Google, AWS, Azure), Tesla FSD and D1, Apple \"bionic\" M1/M2 chips. [They're highly competitive](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-v4-mlperf-2-0-results).\n\nNo moat, no consumer products except niche PC gaming, no Cloud Services, no A.I. services (Chat GPT runs on MS Azure, [PALM on GCP](https://developers.generativeai.google/products/makersuite). MS is still running Nvidia, but [they've been working on their own chip since 2019](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-athena-ai-chip-tsmc).\n\nJust another boring and easily replaceable hardware vendor. Even if A.I. is as promising as market believes it is, demand for Nvidia's equipment will soon drop like it did for Cisco in 2000. How does that look for your Projected Earnings?"

But that's it. You still have income from a job, you still have whatever money in your checking account, but now you can't borrow anymore.\n\nSo the government would have to instantly stop spending above revenue until the limit in the credit card gets raised. That's it.\n\nCurrently, the government spends a bit over $17 billion and makes a bit over $13 billion a day; thus borrowing about $4 billion a day. So when they hit the debt ceiling, they have to spend less for a while."

If you listen to the Q1 2023 earning calls of Invidia, Palantir, C3 AI, Soundhound and so on you start realising how this industry has the potential of starting a new era. Definitely overvalued, but that\u2019s the price you have to pay for getting a piece of this unique pie. Amazon, Apple, Google and the like have all had this phase, where it\u2019s difficult to distinguish between bubble and beginning of a huge growth industry. There have been also plenty of flops, pure bubbles that have at some point burst, where the promises have not held up. So definitely overvalued, but I wouldn\u2019t be that sure it\u2019s a bubble. I tend rather to think this is the beginning of something big, and the markets have realised early on, so are pushing up the prices to crazy levels, but I doubt it\u2019s going much down anytime soon. Give it a try and listen to a couple of relevant earning calls, you\u2019ll get a better sense of what\u2019s happening."

The focus here is around AI, but the platform is really fantastic for any kind of big data processing or high speed provisioning, which includes cloud platforms.\n\nAnd the margins on this stuff are insane. WAY beyond Amazon, Google, Apple's or Microsoft's average margins... and NVDA has significant patents related to the platform which enable highly complex mathematical operations shortcuts, which is part of the reason AMD hasn't been able to ape RTX cores yet.\n\nI take no pleasure in this reality. I think it's awful for consumers and it's going to drive CapEx and prices up, but the overall uplift on performance leaning into the next datacenter hardware refresh cycle, with or without generative AI (and that spending will occur with AI in mind), the platform is going to be too enticing for companies to shy away from it. The margins are high, but so is the relative uplift. \n\nShould it be this way? No.\n\nDoes it totally eliminate any thesis comparing them to consumer-oriented company sales or margins? Absolutely. It's an apples and oranges comparison."

The crypto market went proof of stake, which means you won't be using Nvidia GPU's to mine crypto.  To the day the #2 GPU used on Steam is the GTX 1060, a 2016 graphics card.  The #1 GPU used is a GTX 1650, which isn't much better.  Pretty clear Nvidia's been overpricing their graphic cards for a long time, and now they're riding an AL boom that doesn't exist.  No tech companies is currently spending more money that would buy Nvidia's AI chips.  Nvidia's last quarter has seen a loss in income in everything but automotive.  The only reason people are jumping on Nvidia is the same reason they're on Tesla, because they've done well in the past and to these people what Nvidia does is mystical.

A couple of years afterward he had this to say about that time (via\u00a0Bloomberg):\n\nAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

I don\u2019t ever wish anyone harm, but every failure she or anyone has is a chance for a wake up call, so have no problems in enjoying this catastrophe. Very pleasant and soothing indeed. The consistency and magnitude of these L\u2019s are almost meditative.\n\nThe days come and go. My life is happening, things are always changing. Yet with all this constant motion, Cathie Woods consistently drops the worst trades like clockwork. A steady, colossal, drip of Ls. Every loss she takes is so big it\u2019s scale is lost on my simple mind. Yet there they go. One by one. Each loss and failure measured on a celestial scale that is beyond my grasp. Bigger Ls than I can understand with dollar amounts bigger than what I\u2019ve ever seen or may ever see. I know that no matter what happens in my small little life, Cathie is out there, in the ether, losing more money than I could ever even know.\n\nCathie\u2019s Ls loom over us all in the aether, dripping so mightily. How could us, such small beings, be bound by the same force of time as such colossal and awe inspiring losses? Yet here we are. If time is a big enough place for Cathie\u2019s losses to exist, then how small must we be\u2026 in the grand scheme of time.\n\nThese posts bring me true bliss and contentment."

     "1. Nvidia is stupidly overpriced, no argument there, but they have a monopoly on software libraries and make the best gpus in the world by a huge margin. As far as cpus go, Intel has everything to lose while AMD has everything to gain. Case in point, datacenter. EPYC is uncontested and AMD is taking huge chunks of Intel's datacenter marketshare at will every quarter. \n\n2. Intel is only competitive because their chips use an insane amount more power than AMD. 13900K @ 253w = 7950X @ 142w. Thats far more than just a node advantage and not remotely close. AMD has the superior architecture, not Intel.\n\n3. ARC is NOT competitive with AMD and Nvidia. You can't compare Intel's flagship to 3 year old AMD and Nvidia entry level gpus and claim that. The 770 is roughly on par with competition flagships from 8-9 years ago. So complete and utter dogshit compared to the 4090 or 7900XTX.\n\n4. Pat may be able to turn things around, but that will take years, and  it's no secret that beaurocracy runs rampant at Intel HQ.\n\n5. Incorrect. Jensen said they were good but never said they were going to use them. People misinterpreted it as being about Intel since Jensen mentioned Arizona, suprise! TSMC has a new fab in Arizona too.\n\n6. Same goes for TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries.\n\n7. TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries are building fabs stateside, or already have fabs set up and are funded by the CHIPS Act. Intel isn't going to be the only option if Tawain gets invaded. \n\n8. Most software libraries are written for Cuda. Nvidia essentially has a monopoly on AI due to that alone. AMD has long made competitive work station gpus, but the fact that most software libraries are in Cuda has made them sell poorly by comparison. Intel is in the same predicament."

     "Don't agree with all the bullet points but yes Intel is undervalued. Gelsinger is actually one of its problems IMHO.  Their Tower Semi, Altera and foundry plays are going to do well. Note MOST semiconductors are not leading edge and driven by Moore's Law reductions. Older fabs print money.   \n\nTheir ARC GPU's are a decent first effort but in Intel fashion - late to the party. Their drivers are a hot mess and it will be 3 years before they are on par with NVIDIA or AMD.  Note ARC has no AI/Tensorcores which is what is making NVIDIA the winner.   Intels AI is damn good but is not showing the commitment needed.  With regard to datacenter, Intel is a chip player. Nvidia is a chip player and box and network builder.  Intel has all the pieces but fails to execute. I have to wonder if they are handicapped by NOT competing against their customers. As for their customers - ARM (which Intel had and dumped on Marvell) is King of the Core. Most server farm (especially virtualization) is ARM based.  Alibaba made their own server chip (128 cores/ 128 PCI lanes supporting 16 GPUS) which leaves Intel in the dust.\n\nIMHO Intel has indecisive, risk averse leadership and really poor marketing vision right now. Note it has NEVER had the latter and lived off the PC cash cow business but that is faltering as people are using their PC's much longer and do more and more on tablets and smartphone apps."

They have a huge disadvantage in battery life and efficiency.  The only reason they hold on to market share is they spend a lot to build there moat.\n\n2- Intels stock price is like where it was 20 years ago\u2026.. when they had a technology lead!!  Now they are 2-3 years behind.\n\n3- they are uncompetitive on their most profitable segment\u2026. Where AMD is expected to continue to take market share close to 40% as Intel has no competitive servers on their roadmap until 2025.\n\n4- profits are going to decrease tremendously\u2026. They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry\u2026.how will they compete but on cost?\n\n5-  Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI?  The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space\u2026. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?\n\n6- This post makes me want to \ud83e\udd22 \ud83e\udd2e.

     "INTC has been run like \ud83d\udca9 for at least 20 years (probably closer to 25). They have messed up most of their big projects for a quarter of a century. \n\nRemember Itanium (aka Merced) ? Meanwhile AMD leapfrogged them in the 64 bit space.\n\nWhat was that division they started to make chips for digital televisions and ended up folding after less than a year ? At the time, the NYT ran a story about the prototypes being turned into a very expensive disco ball.\n\nWhat about mobile ? There was an effort at Intel to get x86 chips into Android devices. I am vaguely familiar with it because the company I worked for at the time in the mobile space, was solicited to test one of their chips . Nothing came of it. I think some Samsung 10 inch tablet did use an x86 Intel processor but it also contained some hardware so it could run ARM code.\n\n\nSpeaking of ARM, they've lost the Apple market. And it wouldn't surprise me if, over the next couple of years, Microsoft also ramped up their support for ARM.\n\n\nEven in the data center, there are companies playing with non x86 architectures. And Moore's Law having slowed down significantly since the early 2000's, for some players, general purpose processors aren't cutting it anymore.\n\n\nIntel's last quarter of a century has been an unmitigated disaster. They survive thanks to their legacy businesses, none of which are safe. Management has been uniformly incompetent. Thankfully they didn't spin off their manufacturing or they'd.already be dead.\n\n\nSo given all this, what's different now to make you think Intel's future is brighter than its past ?"

This shows that Intel has a superior design team and they are able to compete even though they don't have the same manufacturing advantages as AMD.\n3. Nvidia's first generation GPUs (ARC) were indeed competitive with last generation Nvidia/AMD cards, and next generation cards from both companies will likely be better with driver updates and new features added by manufacturers such as AIB partners..

If Intel ported their designs to TSMC it's uncertain whether they would be any more competitive. May even be less competitive, as presumably they couldn't achieve the same clock speed - they should be more power efficient though. \n\nTheir CPU designs are good, but their node is not as bad as you seem to think when it comes to raw performance. It has been said their fab teams have carried their design teams somewhat, and that needs to change if they want to become an open foundry.\n\nEven with my pessimistic view of Intel, there's a decent upside if they pull things together. They're probably going to miss this AI boom though, their focus is more existential than growth/opportunity as they cut projects.\n\nIf there's a Taiwan invasion, TSMC will expand massively in US and Europe. Severe disruptions, which will give Intel a great opportunity, but they won't be the only player. They will be way more competitive though, as TSMC won't have cost advantages they can leverage in Taiwan."

     "I asked ChatGPT-4 this\\^ prompt:  \n\n\n\"While I cannot predict future market movements or specific events, there are several factors that could potentially trigger a repricing of a stock like NVIDIA (NVDA) if it is considered overvalued:\n\n1. Earnings reports: If the company releases earnings reports that fall short of market expectations, investors may reevaluate their positions, leading to a decline in the stock price.\n2. Market sentiment: Shifts in market sentiment, driven by factors such as macroeconomic data, geopolitical tensions, or changes in the industry landscape, can affect stock prices. A negative sentiment shift could lead to a repricing of an overvalued stock.\n3. Changes in the competitive landscape: If new competitors emerge or existing competitors gain a significant advantage, it may impact NVIDIA's market position, triggering a repricing of its stock.\n4. Regulatory changes: Changes in regulations or government policies that negatively affect the company's business prospects can lead to a decline in its stock price.\n5. Analyst downgrades: If prominent market analysts downgrade the stock or lower their price targets, it could lead to a selloff.\n6. Sector rotation: If investors start moving their funds from the technology sector to other sectors (due to changing market conditions or a perception that other sectors offer better growth opportunities), it could negatively impact NVIDIA's stock price.\n7. Profit-taking: If a significant number of investors decide to lock in their gains and sell the stock, it may cause a decline in the stock price.\n\nIt's essential to remember that predicting specific triggers for a repricing is difficult, as market dynamics are complex and constantly changing. It is always a good idea to do thorough research, stay informed about market developments, and consult with a financial advisor when making investment decisions.\""

     "*\"Are they poised to rise from the ashes of the current shit show with a freshly trimmed bottom line on costs and* ***a timeless brand****?\"*\n\nIt has taken more than half a century to build the brand equity of a \"timeless brand.\" That brand equity is the wholesome family entertainment brand. For decades Disney and Pixar have been incorporating positive lessons on REAL inclusion, acceptance and tolerance in their films. The question is, will they have the confidence to keep true to what build that brand, or will they go chasing after fool's golf of the fashionable social trends of the day.\n\nBob Iger wasn't brought back just come back to get the cost structure under control, the Board brought him back to reel in the disastrous lurch into wokism and divisive extremist identity politics, as that threatens to tarnish and impair that brand equity. Ironically, it is only Disney that can destroy the priceless Disney brand. The jury is out on whether they will.\n\nWhen they bought ESPN, it was the most powerful franchise in broadcast. But it lurched so far off the rails into racism and wokism that a huge part of its brand equity has been vaporized, and its viewership numbers have been massively flushed. I can't begin to tell you how many people I know who were huge ESPN \"addicts,\" who are apolitical, middle of the road type people who eventually gave up and have gone elsewhere, they found it so unwatchable. Can Disney purge the extremist wokism from the ESPN brand before it tails into irrelevance? Warner Brothers Discovery faces a similar challenge with CNN. WBD has done a major purge, but they may have waited too late. It may never recover. I don't think it's too late for ESPN, but they're going to have to make a move.\n\nIronically, a lot this depends on whether Iger has the mettle and good sense to rise above the button-punching divisiveness of the artificial political \"battles.\" He has a big ego. It's in Disney's long term interest that he not take the DeSantis bait and stoop to engaging with him. DeSantis is not going to stop trying to suck him into a fight, so that Disney can become a prop for political divisiveness. Iger needs to ignore him, rather than knee-jerk in the opposite direction.\n\nIf Disney can stick to the timeless themes that built the brand, it's going to do just fine over the long haul. If not, the jury's out.\n\nI'd add one other thing ... there's an unanswered question as to whether Iger really understands that old media companies are going to have to transition to new platforms. They've got to get their content ported to the world of gaming, and to the world of new world social media, including Tik Tok and YouTube."

They filed an amendment to the one from February (the difference being dilution of 20 billion vs 10 billion). Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).\\n\\nThe bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isnt correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report. \\n\\nTLDR Translation for WSB Bro: NVDA bear fucked. Cant read good. Bear bad reading used to try to scare NVDA bull to give up money for Bear. But Bear fucked because other people read good.'",

I know that first question would be: \"why not use r/wallstreetbets\" but i cant really make heads or tails of it. for example i missed the train on nvidia and palantir and Tesla bull runs.

When the market pulls back like it did in 2020, you go all in... you buy Pepsi, you buy msft, you buy HD, you buy IBM, you buy Coke, you buy aapl, ect. If it's in your refrigerator, under your sink, or in your driveway, it's probably pretty safe to invest. nfa... otherwise, dollar cost avg a low or no cost, etfs that are 4 star rated or higher. Whatever you do, don't fuk with options. Btw again, nfa i eat crayons\n\nIf you want some crayon on a Dennys menu math? You could have, for instance, as resent as January this year bought aapl for 126. 1000\u00f7126 is like what almost 8.. so you could have turned 1000 into like 1450 something. Since January. Personally, i have only ever regretted not buying more aapl. Like every single time! I should have just bought more aapl(\n\nBtw you can't 'day trade' with 1k. You need 25k minimum. Even after this, you can be flagged for pattern 'day trading' if you have too many trades in to short a time. After that, you need to worry/ learn about the 'wash rule'.

I know, I know, the company has had a rough time in 2022. Its 4000 series GPUs were a bit of a disaster, and its shares are down 43% since the start of the year. But hear me out, because I think Nvidia is going to make a comeback in 2023 and crush AMD\\'s efforts in the GPU market.\\n\\nFirst of all, let\\'s talk about Nvidia\\'s position in the market. Despite its recent struggles, the company is still the undisputed leader in the consumer graphics card market. In Q3 2022, Nvidia\\'s share of the discrete graphics card market increased to 88%, up from 80% in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, AMD\\'s share fell from 15% to 8%, and Intel, which only entered the market this year, has a 4% share.\\n\\nNow, I know what you\\'re thinking: \"But what about that disastrous 4000 series launch?\" Well, sure, Nvidia miscalculated its line-up and ended up \"unlaunching\" one '",

     "Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. \n\nHad people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; \n\nhttps://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/\n\nIf anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask.

     "Im no expert but I\u2019ve worked with the Open AI products in an enterprise platform. My take is that it sucks, and will play a very small role in the future of business & consumer electronics.\n\n\nEnterprise Symantec search. That\u2019s the only use case. Useful for things like the GitHub Copilot - the model references documents in your company repo and serves them when you start typing something that looks similar. Useful, basically replaces the need to search \u201chow to _____ stackexchange\u201d. It\u2019s also useful for people who need to reference policy documents, like a customer service rep. \n\n\nThe issue is, ChatGPT3.5 isn\u2019t trained on our company\u2019s policy documents. They\u2019re private, and we want to keep them that way. We\u2019re actually using proprietary models to recognize and serve relevant documents, and then using the outputs of those models to be scripted into conversational outputs by a GPT model. This doesn\u2019t require an AI with a supercomputer, it\u2019s a basic cosine similarity model trained on an extremely limited scope of documents.\n\n\nPeople don\u2019t realize how dumb these Language Models are. They\u2019re great conversationalists, but they don\u2019t know anything. You might as well Google something and press \u201cI\u2019m feeling lucky\u201d, and repeat that till you get what you\u2019re looking for.\n\n\nI see very few jobs going away because of these tools. Programming will get easier, but that\u2019s it. Maybe absolutely bottom barrel content generation like Buzzfeed clickbait shit will go away. Too bad lol."

However, your second point I believe is way off.\n\nNvidia and its CUDA software stack are far better than anything out there on offer. AMD, Intel, and others dropped the ball years ago when they didn't properly support and push for OpenCL. It doesn't help that Nvidia never fully supported it and actively made it the poorer choice performance wise for their cards. It's so bad that OpenCL 3 is actually a rollback to OpenCL 1.2 and makes everything from OpenCL 2 optional.\n\nSo now, with the failure of OpenCL AMD and Intel have decided on their own proprietary implementations. These will take longer than 2 years to catch up to Nvidia, if they ever do.\n\nJust my two cents."

     "Here\u2019s the English version brought to you by our lord and savior chatgpt\n \u201cThis is a fanciful tale about a character named Rizzly, who is a stock market bear - meaning he anticipates a decrease in market prices, and profits by short-selling stocks. He is known for his boldness and wit, often making darkly humorous remarks about his short-selling activities.\n\nIn this tale, Rizzly lives in a town where bullish (optimistic) sentiment is the norm, but he revels in being a contrarian. He sets his sights on the stock of the tech company Nvidia (NVDA), believing it is overvalued and will fall. He creates detailed posts (DDs or due diligence) on the subreddit WallStreetBets (WSB), trying to convince others of his belief. He's so convinced that Nvidia's stock price will fall that he invests heavily in \"puts\", a type of option contract that increases in value when the underlying stock's price decreases.\n\nTo fund this investment, Rizzly even works extra shifts, believing that the payoff will be worth it. After making his investment, he metaphorically hibernates, waiting for his prediction to come true. However, when he wakes up, he discovers that Nvidia's stock price has actually reached an all-time high, and his investment in put options is now nearly worthless. This loss is devastating to him.\n\nThe story concludes with a twist, suggesting that Rizzly was not really a bear but an ostrich, a metaphor for someone who ignores inconvenient truths. The narrator of the story then reveals their position: they hold 30 Nvidia put options, meaning they too are betting on Nvidia's stock price to decrease.\n\nThe TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of this post is: \"Buy NVDA puts\", meaning the author is advising to purchase put options for Nvidia's stock, betting that the price will drop. The meteor emojis \u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f\u2604\ufe0f are used to symbolize a dramatic fall.\u201d"

The S&P 500 rose 1.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 jumped 2.6%. Marvell Technology's announcement that their AI-driven revenue could double by 2024, coupled with Nvidia's impressive 32% increase, contributed to investor optimism.\\n\\nThis positive sentiment was also supported by progress in negotiating the U.S. debt ceiling and federal spending cap. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reassurances eased concerns over the potential for a U.S. default.\\n\\nAs a result, investors demanded less of a premium for holding U.S. Treasury bills, which yielded under 6% on Friday.

A resolution to the debt ceiling issue can be seen as a positive development for the country's fiscal stability, which could attract investors and strengthen the dollar.\n\nStocks down: The impact on stocks can be influenced by several factors. If the debt ceiling agreement involves significant spending cuts or measures that are perceived as negative for the economy, it could dampen investor sentiment and lead to a decline in stock prices. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding the debt ceiling negotiations can create volatility in the market, which may also contribute to stock market fluctuations.\n\nBonds up: In times of uncertainty or when there is concern about government default, investors often seek the relative safety of bonds. If a debt ceiling agreement is reached and provides reassurance to investors, it can lead to increased demand for bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. This is because bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship\u2014when demand for bonds increases, prices rise, and yields decrease."

If any of you have been paying any attention to the GPU and graphics cards market you'd have realized one thing by now. You're shit out of luck if you want to buy a graphics card in the current market - they've been sold out for quite a while now and if you want to buy 1 then be ready to shell out $3k-$4k.. There's even a Japanese retailer selling these babies, the RTX 3090 Ti for a whopping $5500. That's right, let that sink in. These bad boys are selling for 3x the MSRP and NVIDIA is set to launch the GeForce RTX 3090 Ti, you guessed it, right before earnings. Source:[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/european-pricing-emerges-rtx-3090-ti](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/european-pricing-emerges-rtx-3090-ti)\\n\\nMoreover, there had been a severe shortage of GPUs and graphics cards over the past year thanks to the Zuck buying a bunch from NVIDIA for his little VR\"",

Nvidia might be in competition soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) GPU shortage has been easing. A few months ago GPU's could not be bought from Amazon and the like. Now, they are in stock everywhere apart from Nvidia's website. Prices are starting to drop by sometimes more than 10%. Don't bet on the GPU shortage continuing. Point 1 also furthers this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) AMD is catching up on GPU performance, still a couple gens behind but they are catching up. They may have a far better architecture to launch this year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n4) NVIDIA HAS JUST LOST IT'S ACQUISITION OF ARM. This is a big deal. Google it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApes, this guy has not done thorough DD. Nvidia is going to do well, but momentum will be slowing."

NVDA, MSFT, and GOOGL are the only public stocks that are well positioned to benefit from AI (see my previous post). However, I believe that GOOGL and MSFT have more downside than upside potential due to antitrust concerns. This leaves NVDA as the best pick in the space. Additionally, since a large portion of its revenue is derived from data center sales, it is less likely to be impacted by an economic downturn compared to other tech companies. Therefore, I believe that NVDA will outperform the market in both good and bad times which makes it a great long term investment. Lets say another 30% on top of the market or $500 by next year this time \n* FOMO - All you regards who just want to make money will jump on the bandwagon eventually pushing prices even higher .This could add another 60%+to today's value giving us a target price of around $700"

Google, among others, have been building out their cloud infrastructure for over a decade with AI in mind. So much so, in fact, that google built its own proprietary TPU - the tensor processing unit - designed specifically for handling the computational challenges presented by the linear algebra calculations that AI is founded upon. NVIDIA is a decade behind and has little to offer in terms of computational benefits. Any legitimate AI will be powered by the big cloud providers. On top of this, it\u2019s much more about data for training models than compute power. For example, one can achieve quite robust results with a junk acer laptop and a limited budget merely by taking advantage of the existing cheap compute power available in the cloud."

     "Nah AMD's growth and forecast significantly exceeded expectations.  Plus, as they stated on the earnings call, they've spent a significant amount of money to address supply chain issues (which is why there's more chips on the shelves).  On top of both, AMD covers a lot of space outside of PC and will be expanding into the automotive, aerospace, and defense sectors with the XLNX aquisition. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm bullish on semis in general this year, but if you're basing it on PC chips, that is a fraction of what they actually do. If you heard the earnings call, the PC market is going to slow and AMD is actually expecting to remain flat in that industry.  However, they've thrived in other sectors like medical imaging, heavy equipment, etc.   Dont think NVDA will make a 25% move like AMD did.\n\nLisa Su is a genius and has been gearing AMD towards this since 2017. There can only be one Su..."

     "I got a bunch of puts on nvda. I bought puts after they reported last quarter. Sold a bunch and recently bought more. Why? Because I read the financial 10k report and ~50% is video cards. Crypto crash flooded used market with video cards. Gray market is trying to dump. Ebay data shows lots of cards for sale at much lower prices that 2 months ago. Check it out. This is causing video card makers to sell less cards, which has been in the news lately. ~60% of sales is in china and Taiwan. Dollar is strong. Maybe this will be a factor, maybe not. Stock has a PE ratio of ~40 so investors are expecting strong grow. Tack on high gas prices which cause people to buy less discretionary goods such as video cards. Now about Pelosi, they exercised Nvidia calls they bought over a year ago at a $100 strike. I think it\u2019s about 20000 shares. What they are most likely doing is selling calls on the stock they own to all the people that believe nvidia is going to moon. That\u2019s what I would do. But hey, I could be wrong on my analysis and lose a bunch money."

I still think Nvidia is a winner and I am holding my position. Also an interesting fact is I was the first person in the market to buy that particular call strike/date, but now the OI on that call is 635. Its now the highest OI OTM NVDA call out of any long term dates, and I'm going to take credit for all the other regards that bought into that call. **So a total of $5.8M was invested because of my last DD on just that option alone, and there's probably a lot more investment that can be attributed to my post.

I'm thinking markets will be volatile and hope that my puts will eventually print... But, most likely calls will do better. All spy positions are 26 and QQQ's are on 23rd.\\n\\nFor NVDA I was planning to open a call position closer to the day of earnings, because I suspect markets to be swinging back and forth. But, now I'm conflicted, cause I was just bored and looking at some news on CNBC for fun. And came upon this... So yea now Idk I actually kind of agree with Cramer and I know I should inverse myself/Cramer, but this AI hype train is just too FOMO/YOLO/STRONK energy .\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl64vbeshw0b1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1dfc3d62e68735c2ca0665fb17a3695406d19f2f\\n\\nHow about you chaps?\\n\\nSource for Cramer: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/19/jim-cramer-says-brace-yourself-for-next-weeks-debt-ceil\"",

More debt than assets, current factor below 1.0, year over year sales decline, negative cash flow, and increasing share count from equity based compensation.  Wayfair thinks marketing cuts and layoffs will get them to cash flow breakeven.  I think the sales decline will lead to accounts payable draining their cash.\n\nUpdate: I rolled some profits into December 2025 W puts because I think 2024 will have a serious liquidity crisis as Wayfair runs out of cash.  I also opened a short and bought OTM puts on KSS.  Reporting next Wednesday, I think KSS has a big gross margin miss and guiding lower gross margins in Q1.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FWFBThinkTank/comments/11a8et6/kohls_kss_better_hurry_up_and_use_that_kohls_cash/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"

There are exactly 0 cars with Nvidia FSD.\n\nRather than FSD, nvidia chips are used for standard upgrades to vehicles. For example, my Honda fit has lane keeping and adaptive cruise control. Those features cost me between $1000-2000. On a tesla, those features come standard. So you could say that 100% of tesla users buy that tech, and less than 100% buy it for honda (If I remember correctly, the base model didnt even have the option when I bought my car).\n\n\nComparing FSD (which is doesnt have a great definition for comparison) to all forms of sensors is not a great comparison. It is really easy to detect the large metal car directly in front of you moving at appoximately the same speed, but it is a huge step to detecting a crosswalk 2 miles ahead or a one way sign for full self-driving."

     ">Yes, I have observed a similar trend in my portfolio. A small number of stocks tend to drive the majority of gains while losses are more evenly distributed across holdings. This is likely due to the fact that a few stocks tend to outperform the market on average, while most stocks underperform or match the market's return. Therefore, it makes sense that a higher percentage of gains would come from these top-performing stocks."

     "TLDR at bottom\n\nYeah I know it\u2019s not a zero-sum game with the money being pumped in but it still helps to think of it like that for simplicity. \n\nWhen the market moves up it\u2019s usually driven by a surge from a particular industry or just a handful. That means most of your gains come from those companies in those surging industries as other industries stagnate or fall. \n\nIf you have $10 in 10 different industries and 5 of them double in value then you are up $50 or see a 50% gain, if you start with the same $100 and instead 5 are halved in value then you see 25% loss. If both happen then you still see 25% gain. $20 in 5 industries and $5 in 5 industries.\n\nNow if you see that same industry surge with 5 industries doubling in value with no drop in the other 5, then that means those companies have moved up in value relative to the rest of the market. If after that surge the economy pulls back and the entire market falls 10% then $2 is lost from the higher industries and $1 lost from the lower industries.\n\nHigher industries are still up 80% and lower ones are down 10%. Your gains are concentrated and losses are evenly distributed. You are still up to 135%, if you redistributed your $150 after the surge evenly into all 10 industries you would still be up to the same 135%. Showing gains from 5 and losses from 5.\n\nThe reason you should redistribute gains is because if those 5 industries that surged then come back down to where they started, then you lose all your gains at you\u2019re still sitting at 100%. If you redistribute then you\u2019re at 112.5% with no net change in the market. Unfortunately most people move everything to the trending industry and end up at 75% original value in a neutral market OR chase it as it\u2019s peaking because they missed the surge don\u2019t want to miss further upward movement and end up at  50%\n\nTL;DR:  Some industries boom during growth but the economy usually falls pretty evenly. Don\u2019t get greedy and be sure to diversify."

The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.\\n\\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run \"",

As noted in the recap, we swept a few sell-side liquidities and have a few more to check off, IMO. Could we bounce at the current level? Absolutely. Is it probable? No, in my opinion, because we are balanced at this level and have a few buy-side imbalances and sell-side inefficiency below the current level that the market may be looking to balance. Ive established that we are in a bull market and looking for a pullback.\\n\\n# Market Momentum Pauses as AI-Fueled Rally Steadies; Investors Eye Congressional Debt Deal\\n\\n**May 30th Recap**\\n\\nThe stock market's momentum stalled after a dramatic rally, driven by the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence technologies, catapulted the market to its loftiest heights since August. Treasury yields dipped in anticipation of the U.S. Congress passing a resolution to avert a debt default.\"",

     "Please read all of this. I know it\u2019s a wall of text but it\u2019s a well written and well informed speculation and I\u2019d love to have a conversation about it. So yeah, read away and tell me what you think :)\n\nI\u2019m bearish for 2 reasons + Extra reason at the end (read to see why I didn\u2019t just say 3)\n\nFirstly, the average person has a LOT less disposable income now. I\u2019d imagine less people are going and buying brand new NVIDIA GPUs. For the dedicated gamers who do want to build a pc, they could easily shop around and find a second hand card (I\u2019ve heard a lot of miners are selling cards now, this follows on in my next point) for a way lower cost. I mean, new GPUs are extortionately expensive. Cards still being sold several hundred above MSRP. I love gaming but if I was struggling to keep up with the cost of living, I wouldn\u2019t be buying a pc, or building a PC that\u2019s ultimately going to cost me a fair bit over 1000. Money better spent elsewhere\n\nAnd also, following on about the miner point, Ethereum 2.0 Merge is set to happen around October ish time. Basically, ETH is changing their system which eliminates the need for mining. Therefore the massive amount of cards that got mass bought by miners, will then be sold and hugely inflate the market with second hand GPUs anyway, since miners no longer have a use for them. This further backs up the idea that people spending decent money would probably rather get a massively cheaper second hand card than buying new, which eats into NVDAs profit (hypothetically)\n\nThis happens at a bad time aswell. IF, and that\u2019s a pretty big if because I\u2019m a retard who can\u2019t accurately predict macro economic changes and their effects on consumers\n\u2026but still,\n IF NVDAs earnings are bad for Q3, obviously shares drop. And if I\u2019m right about my theory on NVDA sales continuing to stay low after Ethereum 2.0, that\u2019s lined up HORRIBLY with the buildup to Christmas, which I haven\u2019t checked but I\u2019d assume is when their sales are normally at their highest. That\u2019s horrible for nvda because there\u2019ll (in my theory) still be people all rushing to buy their GPUs, but they\u2019ll be buying the cheap second hand ones. \nThat would make their Q4 earnings bad and probably miss quite hard on their earnings predictions if Christmas is normally their highest sales period. \n\u2026\n\nIm still continuing that train of thought btw I just don\u2019t want it to be a big wall of text.\n\n\u2026\nWhat compounds (my theory of) NVDA\u2019s woes to make it even worse, is that typically, consumers cut back on spending after the new year because people have gone out and spent way too much in the Christmas period, put it on their credit cards etc etc\n (I know this for a fact because my family runs a haulage/transport business, almost all of our work is moving freight for FedEx, and after New Years is always when work is the quietest because general volume is down, oh and the buildup to Christmas is always our busiest time which solidifies what I said earlier about Christmas buildup)\nSo yeah 2023 Q1 could suck ass for NVDA. This is compounded further by the fact that energy+utility bills are set to raise HUGELY around, and after Christmas both in the US and Europe. So people have even less spare money to dump atleast 1000 into what\u2019s ultimately a luxury, and a toy (don\u2019t get mad I have a high spec pc so I include myself in that but I\u2019m just saying it how it is)\n\u2026\nSo yeah, if that part plays out aswell, Q1 could be pretty bad for them. And when investors start to see that NVDA has had 3 consecutive bad quarters, they would have little faith in the stock. \n\nADDITIONAL SLAM DUNK REASON WHY NVDA COULD BE BAD:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) builds THE BULK of NVIDIAs chips. That\u2019s fact btw search it up. Taiwan as you probably know is facing the threat of a Chinese invasion. And the threat has only grown and grown in recent months, with China not long ago exercising live fire ops with their navy, in extremely close proximity to Taiwan\u2019s water borders, in 6 (I think 6 might of remembered wrong) separate locations. Xi Jinping has said publicly a lot of times that he wants to invade Taiwan.\nChina even took to verbally threatening America simply because someone from the US Gov (high up, can\u2019t remember who) visited taiwan on undisclosed business. Taiwan has also been buying a lot of military gear from America.\n\nSee what I\u2019m getting at? I\u2019m not saying there will or won\u2019t be an invasion, but the threat is there. It\u2019s a big, and undeniable threat. TSM produces a large amount of the worlds computer chips, it\u2019s one of taiwans biggest economic strengths. Not that an invasion wouldn\u2019t already end TSMC\u2019s chip export anyway, but it would be high on chinas priority list to destroy TSMC. \n\nSo yeah, that could be NVDAs entire chip supply down the drain. And chip foundries aren\u2019t something that can just be knocked up in a few months. They take years (I think, I could be wrong on that) to construct and get running&operational. If China did invade, NVDA would almost certainly have to pause business.\n\nThat\u2019s the end of my essay. Call me a gay bear if you want. I prefer to be bullish I\u2019m not a perma bear but NVDA imo has the potential to be in for a rough time"

We've been on a massive bull run, topped off by practically cheap monies (0% Interest rates), quantitative easing monies, and overblown P/Es on the largest tech companies. I would say those top ~~5 are great long term~~ few large market cap companies like MSFT/AAPL/NVDA could be good long term (excl. TSLA) but just be wary and continue to diversify through low cost broad market ETFs like $VOO and $VTI. (Added: Look at what you are willing to pay for the current earnings, and future earnings potential - We could go through a market drop and it could take years to recover just like what happened with major companies in 2000. Look at CSCO/MSFT/etc and see how long it took for those to recover all while making substantial revenue - Dollar Cost Avg is still one of the best ways to go long term).\n\nEdit: I did want to clarify; (added and edited above)"

     ">your diversification is not diversification. If you buy indexes, you\u2019re really just buying the Big 7\n\nI like the work you put in for your post. And while your statement isn't false, I also wouldn't agree that it's a fair assessment of VOO/SPY.\n\nThere is less diversification and overweight in tech RIGHT NOW. But the S&P500 top performers have changed throughout the years.\n\nThe point of indexes etfs and their fees is that they will automatically rotate and rebalance. Most businesses aren't successful. Even successful businesses don't always stocks that go up. Even those don't always have high ROI. Even if a business outperforms and returns higher ROI, it might only do so in a sector where it's peers are doing poorly.\n\n***The overweight on the top performers in the SPY/VOO isn't a bug. It's the fucking feature.*** Some might need to realize this if they don't, but investors that actually real the prospectus before investing would know and buy because of it. It's overweight on tech right now because the market has deemed those as the best stocks. I know it's common on WSB to believe we're a bunch of special snowflakes that can outsmart the market but anyone with 101IQ would realize that the market is often much smarter than the average guy. Each of those companies have strong moats, high growth, strong balance sheets, strong revenue streams, high profits, return value to shareholders, etcetcetc\n\nAsk yourself do you really want a higher % weight of SVB, SBNY, FRC, DISH, FOX, or NWS? No because they fucking suck. Look at the loss porn.  Even their smaller weights are too much because people who bought VOO/SPY had their SVB and SBNY basically go to 0. They should be fucking mad those were in there at all and glad they were saved by being overweight into MSFT & GOOG instead of those shits.\n\nYou wouldn't even want JPM, BAC, WFC, or C over the tech stocks. They are the ones getting BTFO and going back to pandemic lows. They are suffering low growth, locked into low rate bonds, have billions in unrealized losses, have the risk of bank runs or credit contagion, and are begging the government for bailouts . Fucking Apple? Has over $150B IN CASH RESERVES. You know how much fucking money that is? That was the money THE FUCKING US GOVERNMENT HAD TO PUT OUT TO BAIL OUT SVG AND SBNY. APPLE COULD HAVE BAILED THOSE FUCKS OUT BY ITSELF. THAT'S WHY THE MARKET IS BUYING APPLE AND PUSHING IT'S CAP UP. And Apple doesn't have that debt. Instead it has a strong revenue source. \n\nNot really my job to tell you all what to do or think, but the great thing is that we can all make our own investments. Anyone who doesn't like the weighted S&P can go buy the equal weighted S&P or YOLO into 0DTE FRC."

Seems like the perfect setup for the most successful investor of all time, who is nearing the end of his life, to take the market with him when he goes down.\n\nThe most interesting scenario I could come up with from this situation is the following:\n\n1. Warren Buffett takes Berkshire's entire cash position ($100B) and shorts QQQ. That alone would tank the market if it got out, but it's not good enough for a true doomsday scenario.\n2. He sells his entire stake in AAPL, which causes the shift to begin.\n3. Simultaneously, he releases the dirt he has gleaned from his best friend Bill Gates, both from Bill's private life and the horrible state of affairs only they know about at Microsoft.\n4.

Part of the reason people don't think this bear market has bottomed is because the S&P 500 didn't get that 40% or 50% drawdown, but current small cap valuations are basically around where they bottomed during the GFC. But the S&P 500 is more concentrated than it ever has been and you won't get that 40% to 50% drawdown without AAPL and MSFT getting cut in half. Do you think they will get cut in half?

His new price target for AMD is $111, down from $144, while Intels target was cut to $49 from $53. He retained a Hold rating on both the stocks.\\n\\n> Nvidia remained a Buy for Stein, even though he lowered his price target to $298 from $347. While he is constructive on the stock and continues to rate it a Buy, he said near-term price effects could become more volatile.'",

I just tried different things and mainly bought what some guy on YouTube viewed as promising. They mostly turned out quite instable, however I was still able to make some profit out of them.\\n\\nToday, I decided to finally sell all of them, take my profit and equally YOLO it along with 4/5 of my savings. I randomly selected these three tech giants: Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta. One, because I know a lot about them and two, because I personally cannot see them significantly drop in value in the long term. \\n\\nSo, what do you think? Can I expect some profit or am I a complete retard? Thanks for the outlook!\"",
