Is it a good buy now? -  considering the AI and supreme court win.\\n\\nMy portfolio is mostly tech stocks like AMZN, MSFT, INTC, and GOOGL. But more than 50% is in GOOGL. I was planning to buy some stocks in AAPL too and start investing in ETFs for diversification.\\n\\nI  just started in early January 2023 with the intention of long-term holding stocks but I would love to hear from you in this volatile market.\\n\\nThanks!'",

     "Actually im considering going hard in on GOOGL and AMZN. \n\nGOOGL: people saying Bing will take over, its a joke. ChatGPT is great and i have used it a lot, but i have not used google less. Completly different use cases. Google has had insane growth rates over the years, and even if its going to slow down a bit its not going to stop anytime soon because of chatGPT. If anything, ChatGPT will just boost MSFT when they integrate it to office and azure. \n\nAMZN: behemoth currently valued below 1T, which in reality should be the valuation of AWS alone. They are catching up and surpassing competitors in so many categories: distribution, advertising, entertainment etc. \n\nIm really hoping for a bigger market crash so i can go in hard, but just in case it doesn\u2019t come i have started averaging in both these companies"

But before taking a position on Amazon, I would ask myself, to know if I'm paying a fair price:\n\n* Will Amazon benefit more from AI than his competitors? Compared to Microsoft Azure for example (and there are many others)?\n* Why would most households want to buy Alexa? Many people are fed up with large corporations intruding in their lives. Will most household want to have such a device in their home?\n* For those who want that, will Alexa really be so superior to alternatives, such as those from Google and Apple?\n* Will Prime Video benefit more from AI than Netflix, Disney or anyone else in the streaming business?\n* It seems households will be spending less for consumers goods in the coming months, because of rising interest rates. How will that impact Amazon?\n* Will AWS growth remain as strong as is has been in the current economic context?\n* How well will Amazon compete with Alibaba in India?\n\nIf I had a positive answer for all the questions above, I would go ahead. If not, maybe I would wait to see if the stocks goes back in the 90-100$ range, or commit less money for a position on Amazon."

After considering those impacts, a bullish view still looks appropriate for the long term.\\n\\nTo deal with its $2.7 billion loss in 2022, Amazon began a raft of cost-cutting measures, including halting its experimental projects, cutting 18,000 jobs, and pausing grocery store growth. Those moves should benefit the company over the long run because 2022 served as a sort of wake-up call: even tech behemoths arent invincible.\\n\\nHowever, when we look more closely at Amazons valuation relative to its history, it becomes clear that it may take some time for the bull thesis to play out.

Kroger is a much cheaper e-commerce play if you want to buy a US company investing in delivery and growing their e-commerce capabilities, such as by opening warehouses for online delivery in Florida (where they don't have any retail stores).  International e-commerce options like MercadoLibre are growing faster than Amazon, giving a chance to get in at an earlier stage in their lifecycle.  I'd also look at niche retailers, like sporting goods, that are getting into e-commerce such as Dicks Sporting Goods or Academy Sports.  It is much easier for these niche players to grow revenue by double digits, while Amazon's size is starting to slow down its ability to grow or succeed in new ventures."

If the answer is as shallow as, to sell it for more later, then you will always be guessing and hoping your guesses pan out. These stocks could tank, they could go to the moon. \n\nFor each stock I buy I have a buying statement that I save. I am buying X company because... That statement is my foundation for when and if I sell. I bought Intel at $32 on its way down, because I believe in the capex plan to increase domestic chip manufacturing and pivoting from competing with Nvidia and AMD to competing with Taiwan semiconductor. So, my foundation is no matter what the price does I'm in it until their pivot plan has a chance to succeed. I'll hold until a few years after all their new plants are built and reassess them then. \n\nThinking that way is so much less stressful than panicking over the action of the price from day to day, and wondering if I'm smart or dumb for buying/holding/selling."

I slowly worked my portfolio up to 20k through pretty much nothing but meme stocks. I somehow managed to keep 18k of that then decided to move onto options after seeing the gains posted on WSB. I mostly traded QQQ and spy options until I lost all but 6k. I think I'm done with that community and the brainless casino style investing. I'm trying to put together a stable and not so regarded portfolio. Any help is appreciated this is what I have so far and I also have 2k in t-notes/bonds that mature 6/31. Should I find some more stocks or just put that into what I have going here? Appreciate any help and feel free to insult me I deserve it.\"",

The fact that, prior to now, your entire trading strategy was based off of stuff you read on of Reddit is proof of that. Ultimately, it's your portfolio so it's your fault if you listen to some random on Reddit who likely has about as many qualifications as you do.\n\nDo you read (actually read) companies' financial statements? Do you look into their competitors to get an idea of the industry as a whole? Do you assess their capital/debt structure? How's their C-suite looking and what is their history and qualifications? Do you know how to read credit ratings? Can you make these assessments in the context of broader market conditions and systemic risk? I could go on, but the point I'm trying to make is that I don't think you'd be making many the trades you've been making if you had been asking these kinds of questions.\n\nEveryone wants the feeling of pulling all the knobs and levers so they can convince themselves they're geniuses when they make anything resembling a profit however this often leads to a fallacious lines of thinking. It's how you can give yourself all the credit for building 20k portfolio but then feel completely fine shifting the responsibility for the significant losses you incurred onto some un-named \"WSB moron\". You are not in control, at all.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with ETFs as long as you continually put money into them.

If you do, it's fine, it just means you wanted more weight in this or that title. In the end, the biggest allocation should still be the S&P500. \n\nI personally believe in more diversification than this on the long term, like international (also emerging markets to a lesser extent). I don't have any ticker to recommend since I buy pretty much everything in CAN$, but an ETF holding the whole world excluding the US would be a good diversification. It also tends to give more dividends than the US market. People tend to say to just invest in the US because of the higher return, but there's a lot of studies on bogleheads showing that adding some international helps the risk reward curve and can even provide a higher total return during flat periods. Between 5 and 20%.Emerging around 5%, no more than 10%.\n\nYour tech heavy, and concentrated in Google, Apple, etc... I prefer to buy the Nasdaq100.\n\nI also like to increase my exposure to real estate. Avoid ETFs with commercial right now. I don't mind paying fees for active management in real estate.\n\nThey say to always have some gold, either billions or an ETF if gold producers."

The stock market can be a good way for companies to raise money and for investors to make money, but it also involves risk as the value of stocks can fluctuate widely.

More products, also includes Video streaming, probably other stuff that i dont know about. \n\nI really only see them taking market share in urban areas where people have more discretionary income and can afford 2 subscriptions. Maybe years down the line theyll start taking up more share, but Amazon is constantly working to improve their experience as well. \n\nDisclaimer: i work for Amazon"

Our markets in absolute shambles right now regulatory wise/abuse wise.\n\n\nJust like the NYSE 'glitch' the other day at open. They left the dang Disaster Recovery system on. That's not a mistake. It's never happened. And suddenly, t-2 from Jan 20th Swaps rollover we get some insane market 'glitch'. If you were smart, you'd have bought options and banked instantly in all that stuff that tanked.\n\n\nAPs and MMs submit orders that are place on the opening bell the first second via a matching system which determines the opening price of stocks. Then of course they manipulate trades premarket on low volume to shake out weak investors.\n\n\nThey are even using the glitch as an excuse to stop the SEC from switching from Payment for Order Flow to the new Auctioning system in March.\n\n\nTLDR: certain market participant manipulating and using it against the sec decision to change PFOF in March.\n\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-01/nyse-glitch-caught-up-in-fight-over-sec-rewrite-of-trading-rules"

The flow of stock market money away from tech stocks into other industries and away from those currently overvalued/priced tech companies.\n\nIf you wanna buy low and sell high, well it's the time to sell after a long bull run on tech and buy what is currently cheap as a result of the pandemic. It's a gamble that may pop y off.\n\nFor those quoting the past disastrous performance (portafolio value down from $17.52B to $12.92B), SoftBank just learned a $4.5B lesson.

Shoot holes in my plan. \\n\\n\\nWhat are potential downfalls to this strategy? I understand that if the price sky rockets I could miss out on those profits which is why I only plan on selling 1 covered call for each. If the price falls thats ok I still own the premium.

You have to be mentally strong and discipline to make the cut. Learn to close your position and start switching to potential stock that will give you profit in 2023. Forget about 2022.\n\n3. If you are here and reading this, close off NVAX and FUN. We are in post pandemic and NVAX is not going to climb back up and if you are going to invest in FUN. I rather you look into RCL. They have potential to get into $100 as soon as 2023Q2.\n\n4. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re honest about your losses prolly because no one know you here. That\u2019s the first step to profitable. Remember to look into the time period you going to trade/invest\u2014 more important know your risk appetite. \n\n5. Message me if you need more help to adjust your portfolio.

Its just been going down. I would probably try to see if I can offload on someone during a pre-earnings/pre-open price spike or something if one happens.\n\nBut if you think the company can rebound in a few years and can push out some amazing 'products' in the future, then you may want to hold onto it.

So just hold for another few months as the market sentiment likely improves a bit. Also seems like more and more companies acknowledges that they have to start cutting costs aggressively, so that could help a igniting a small rebound as well. Id say it\u2019s almost impossible for many to hit all time highs, but a swift and small rally is likely for the next few months. \n\nAnother thing is that crypto likely does best in split gov, biggest fears on crypto is more regulations.  For  stocks though, biggest fear is more US inflation. Sentiment for crypto is high across the globe, places like Vietnam actually has lower inflation numbers. As for India, while their inflation is even higher than US, their gdp growth is in double digits. People in those places really love owning more crypto. From the inflation estimates, seems like US inflation will continue to be high which will put pressure on stocks again after any midterm in the midweek."

     "The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn\u2019t fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don\u2019t realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.  \n     This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out."

     "I wouldn\u2019t take specific advice from anybody on here.  Really from anybody anywhere.  Nobody knows when the market will enter a bull phase or how stock a vs stock b will do.  \n\nThis is why experts tell us amateurs to invest in index funds.  We don\u2019t have the data or time to do individual stock investing.  It\u2019s a game where you are trying to outsmart other people who are smarter and have more time and experience than you.  So you are gambling to get lucky.   Diversify and play the long game.  It\u2019s the only thing that works for individual investors over the long term (unless you have insider info).  Don\u2019t try and time the market, but instead invest more during down periods to cost average down.  The market always trends up over long time horizon.  \n\nLastly, everybody thinks they are a genius when they are doing well, which is very common during bull markets (last 12-13years).  So most of the advice you\u2019ll get is from \u201ckids\u201d who haven\u2019t been through multiple cycles.  Those older people like myself have and know better.  Good luck and don\u2019t be stupid/greedy/impatient/emotional or else you will lose."

It opened yesterday at $3,270.  Compared to other tech stocks, many of which have went up 15-50% in the past 6 months, AMZN just hasnt performed.  And yes, I know it gained around 70% last year...but I'm talking about the past 6-7 months specifically.\n\nNow with that being said I think that the stock is due for a breakout.  Price targets are high like you pointed out.  The past 3 earnings have blown expectations out of the water.  As a company they are still growing and management seems very capable.  The technical charts are also showing a pennant pattern which indicates that a breakout will most likely occur.  The questions is \"When?\"  It could be in the next few weeks or it could still be another 6 months from now.  Overall I still think the stock is fantastic for long term holds...but dont hold your breath for anything amazing in the short term because it may not perform."

I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started \"investing.\" The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  \n\n\nedit: downvoted for being a loser i already know"

Considering getting few more apple shares  then adding INAQ and PLTR to my portfolio. \\n\\nIve always heard that you dont sell Amazon, just let it grow but I feel like Im missing out on these new companies that could jump 30%++ in just a few months.'",

In the longer run, I am excited about the companies management to be a catalyst for the growth engine, they have bet on certain trends and got most of it right ( device's, streaming etc)  ( compared to a Google, .. ) . Something tells me they will be in self driving cabs or space mining etc when the timing is right.

It\u2019s called the rule of 20 you can look it up. The average is around 18.2. \n\nAlso, in 2021 the S&P doubled from its pandemic bottom, marking the fastest bull market rally since WWII.

     "As usual everyone isn\u2019t looking at the big picture. Todays sell off is simply the beginning of the downturns in the markets. F Amazon. F Apple. F the fangs and look out below. Stubborn inflation will result in all stocks being downgraded until we have a 12 PE ( or worse ) and interest rates about 5 percent ( or higher) and people start getting laid off. Anecdotal stories of the housing markets are JUST starting! I suspect the October GDP will not only show another downturn but according to the third time in a row it represents a depression. There are too many people betting on a pivot, a turnaround, a sudden miracle where the markets will suddenly go up. Not happening. The VIX had to hit higher than 40 ( doesn\u2019t mean a capitulation) and can go higher still. Higher interest rates will send NASDAQ below 10k to 9500, a 40% decline ( not unusual for these stocks) and an SPX below 3400.  This is a bear market. Cash is king. Listening to those long term pundits who won\u2019t care about the pain you are suffering only means they want your assets so they can profit on your portfolios. But then again, what\u2019s going on may be too late for most of us. After all, new investors ( all you kids 40 years old and younger ) all believe in buying the dips. After your lessons this year and next you can learn what it means to be \u201cprudent\u201d."

     "Doing a lot wrong.\n\nRead my investing bible\n\n1. Buy good companies with strong financial statements.  Companies with low debt, and companies that show a trend of growing and increased net income and revenue. Once you understand how to read a financial statement, you can make 70% of your decision to buy based on the financial statement, even before knowing what the company is.\n \n2. Only buy companies that has a competitive advantage, one that would be had for another company to overtake them.  A company where you can envision that 50 years from now, they will still be relevant.\n \n3. Buy undervalued companies.  There are many companies out there with great financial statements, a trend of growth, but the price must be right.  For example, Amazon shows consistent growth, but at their current price and how much net income they are bringing in and P/E ratio, it will take many decades for them to make enough money to warrant that current price evaluation.\n \n4. You only need a few very good companies to get rich.  People that diversify don\u2019t know what they are doing, so they try to mitigate risk.  But to get wealthy, you go all in only a few stocks that you have thoroughly researched and meets all the criteria stated above.  People that get very rich, they do it off only a few stocks.  You want all your money in a good company where when it moves, it moves in a big way.  Enough to move the needle.\n \n5. Have a strategy, once you know the top 5 companies you are going to invest in, the price fluctuation doesn\u2019t matter as much anymore.  It will go up and down periodically, but each time it goes down, you need to buy more.  Load up as much as you can when the price is low.  You are betting on your research and confidence that 10 years from now this company will grow many folds.  It\u2019s hard to predict in the short term whether a stock going to go up or or down, but I can predict with high certainty that a stock will go up in 10 years.  \n \n6. Stock investing is simple.  If a company is profitable and consistently brings in profit, the stock will grow and so will your money.\n \n7. Ignore the micro / temporary issues in society.  For example, covid, new politician, fear of war, Ukraine invasion etc.  All this does not matter, it\u2019s only temporary. A good company that historically shown to make profits and grow, they will overcome and continue to grow the long run.\n \n8. Do not invest money if you need the money in the short run.  For example you need the money in a week a month or even a year.  Stock investing is long run, most big profits are made in year 6 or higher.  You need to be able to buy and hold for 10 years to see substantial increases.\n \n9. Do not invest in speculative stocks.  Don\u2019t invest in the story, for example \u201cmarijuana stocks\u201d is the future, or electric cars or renewable energy is the future.  Only invest in companies that you can check their financial statement and see they have a trend of growth.  Not saying to invest in well established companies that are profitable, but you need to find a company that you look at the financial statements and pick up a trend of growth.  NIO is an example of a good stock that has shown growth.  Although they are still not in the green on net income yet, they show a trend of increasing revenue each year, closing the gap on the net income to be profitable and each year they are producing more cars and expanding their markets.  \n \n10. Remove the prejudice in your investing strategy.  Don\u2019t be prejudice because you don\u2019t like investing in oil, or because it\u2019s from China you don\u2019t like Chinese people, or you don\u2019t like investing in companies that start with the letter A.  All that does not matter, you are here to make money.   Invest wisely by analyzing the financial statement and where the trajectory of that company is going.\n \n11. Never sell a stock when it\u2019s low.  If you invest in good companies stated above, these companies has always recovered and increase their stock price significantly after the turmoil.  \n \n12. Invest in companies that has room to grow.  Think of stock investing like how many innings in a baseball game.  Ask yourself, where is this company now, is it in the 1st inning or is it in the 9th inning.  For example Amazon, ask yourself where is this company at in it\u2019s life, is this company now fully matured, do they still have room to grow? In my opinion, Amazon is near the full maturity stage, it\u2019s in the 7th inning, there\u2019s not much more room for it to expand or grow.  But Alibaba, is the 2nd biggest competitor to Amazon, and it shows a great financial statement and the trajectory of it to grow is still quite high.  They are consistently getting more active user each year and the market they are in, which is China still has a lot of room to grow.\n \n13. Do not options trade, it\u2019s gambling.  It\u2019s hard to predict a stock going up or down in the short run.  To ensure high probability of success, buy good, undervalued companies and hold long run.\n \n \n \n \n \nWritten by Ethan Lee"

Amazon looks to be a heavy percentage.\n\nI would swap out VUG for VTI\n\nAnd I would scrap Intel / Rivian . \n\nIntel is trending downwards, if your doing it for growth I think AMD/NVIDIA/TSMC is a way better play, especially at the current valuations. And it seems like your portfolio is heavy growth so I don\u2019t know if you care much about the dividend yield. \nNot very bullish on Rivian, but also not to read up on them. So I can\u2019t speak to that company as much. But my ignorant perspective is that there are much better, unprofitable risky stocks than Rivian. (Personally I like SOFI at these prices) \n\nWould probably scrap Berkshire too and put that money into some of the big tech or VTI. Doesn\u2019t really fit the overall portfolio IMO. \n\nThis is me bored nitpicking though, totally\nNot advice lol . I actually dig the portfolio"

I\u2019ve mentioned before we need to see a 40 % down Nasdaq, a 28k Dow and at least a 3400 SPX where everyone will get scared shitless and get out and then the long term players can finally get back in.  The Fed is finally taking the punch bowl away and letting the gamblers lose their money.  You could see this coming a mile away. Just too many young investors never dealing that yes, you can buy the dips as long as you realize you may bloody your hand on the falling knife. I don\u2019t know what kind of holiday season we will have but the consumer may either buy because there\u2019s no tomorrow or save their money for the high priced groceries, doctor bills, high gas prices and losing their job.

     "The micro-trend's bullish consolidation on both the SPY & QQQ pierced, and more importantly closed, above their flag's celing, but much more so on the SPY than the QQQ.  As a result, the SPY is considerably closer to major resistance than the QQQ (e.g. $8 on the QQQ vs. only $2 on the SPY).  Of note, SPY did close above its 200 DMA, whereas QQQ remains below its 200 DMA.\n\nThe fact today's move occurred on comparatively high volume (144M & 75M respectively) suggests institution's participated, as opposed to only retail investors.\n\nCritical for the bulls will be a SPY close above at least 407.68 and a QQQ close above at least 293.47.  Regardless, with so many resistance levels above current price, upside will stil likely be limited in both price and duration."

The downside risk is basically that if the market plunges ina single year qqq will likely plunge further than SCHD but on the flip side it has better growth on average.\n\nBetween those two you will have a somewhat riskier approach and a somewhat conservative approach. Both are good choices and both are worth putting money into.\n\nThe dividend aristocrats will provide additional stability to your account. \nThe reit will provide a monthly dividend that can compound. Over a very long period that can add up to a sizeable revenue stream.\nThe jepi or covered call ETF will also provide a regular income stream that is different from the reit. Again not a bad idea.\n\nAs for how to balance between those that depends upon your goals and the tax status of the accounts you have the money in. The longer the money will be held the more attractive qqq and schd will be. The more you want it to assist with bills in 5 years time the better jepi looks.

Why several .25\u2019s over the next four to five months as opposed to getting to 5% and sitting there. Of course unemployment out on Friday and if there is no sign of an increase or if wages are still increasing then the Fed will have wished for the 1/2 point.

Or will it be Dow 25,000. Imagine that and SPX 3200. These sound like really pain points because there are too many idiots saying buy the dips and that\u2019s the reason for no VIX spike, no fear of 70-120 SPX drops, and the bullish believe of pivots and low gas prices means no inflation or recession. The last 20 years has too many young analysts who have never first handed a real true recession. 2001 was almost a recession but the black swan event (9/11) turned it into a market crash. 2008 no one saw coming. Most of these old time analysts who still work for Financial firms are trying not to scare any clients which is why no one tells you to get out the first time the fed raises interest rates. Of course the smart money knows how to make money in a bear market, which we are in. Are you the smart money or just a novice investor ( few years or less)."

Whereas, equal weighted index funds do better but not by much. You have to diversify even between index funds in your portfolio. If you are tech heavy in one, you need another thats utilities or consumer staples heavy and so forth. This is in addition to large cap, mid cap and small cap distributions in your overall portfolio.

     "Yeah.  Warren Buffett\u2019s point is that is is next to impossible for the average investor, or even sophisticated investors, to outperform the market over a long period of time so best idea is to just buy the market hence his suggested S&P 500 (or one of the many ETFs that mirrors it).  You can go broader or pick up international via similar ETFs that each have their theoretical pluses and minuses but basically the same theory.  That 25% of the index is in 5 names is troublesome but that is unlikely to last for all sorts of reasons.    \n\n\nIf you were good enough to buy the winners (before they were winners) and sell the losers (before they became losers) you\u2019d obviously beat the market.  There are various strategies that, if implemented religiously, historically have beaten the market but once enough folks find out about them, the excess returns are arbitraged away as others pile into the strategy.

Even Mac sales are heavily driven by people developing apps.  I know a lot of people that have an iPhone and an iPad.  I know very few people that have an iPad alone.\n\nSo Apple needs to come up with something new to drive growth.  We have reached peak smartphones and this means all players in smartphones will now see margins squeezed in the coming years.  I like Apple products.  I have an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.  In facts I have more than one of each.  That doesn\u2019t mean I think their stock is worth buying right now.\n\nApple\u2019s is supposedly going to go into the video streaming business.  My concern there is that space is going to get very crowded in the next few years.  Seems like everyone is planning a new streaming service.\n\n\u2014 \nI think Amazon will eventually recover."
