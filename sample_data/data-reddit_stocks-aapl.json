It\u2019s going to sell however it sells.\n\nPeople will figure out what they want to do with it, and what it sucks at currently.\n\nApple will iterate and if necessary make other choices if the AppleID\u2019s say so.  Until then, focus on everything else was just released, as a gap in the Mac product lineup has been filled, and there\u2019s a constant stream of tweaks and fixes that keep AppleID\u2019s happy and using their devices.\n\nIndia is now unlocked and it\u2019s the next major population target of growth and recurring Apple purchases.

The amount of sheep that buy into their products with little understanding that they are LEGITIMATELY being scammed blows my mind.

People purely love apple for its aesthetic, \"celebrity status\" and easy to use OS, which masks the list of issues in its design and limited lifetime use. If only the cost actually reflected what you got.\n\nThe swing to android has slowly started to increase as their phones continue to prove valuable and durable.\n\nImo, and this is not financial advice. Ride the apple stock train but watch for the social clues to know when to jump. Proven by pictures, meetings and documents of hedgefunds, Apple talks quite often with big hedgefunds (such as citadel). Theres now way they would let Apple tank."

Apple cannot die until something comes along to replace them and that product is no where to be seen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: im just some idiot on reddit."

Along with this, they just started HYSA partnership with Goldman Sachs, if they charge GS a 1% fee of the interest rate of 4.15%, thats 275M in revenue which is extremely high margin. I mean PayPal, lower growth is valued at 85B, so with Apple Pay growth prospects it alone is probably worth 50B.\n\nI mean this is their best example but it just shows how they can just supercharge product development in services and if they lose in certain products, atleast they take a cut of competitors revenue lol. I think overtime they are going to become a better version of the Microsoft model of providing a platform with any enterprise product that may be a little lower quality than alternatives, but are integrated into the Microsoft platform so are just easier to use, though I think Apple being apple to take a cut of competitors enhances this type of model among other aspects."

Now I am wondering if I should sell them and allocate into that \\\\~15% into VIG or SCHD or other individual companies for more diversity. \\n\\nAdvice appreciated - ty!'",

Neither Apple or Microsoft are going out of business any time soon. I think I read some article that said that every $1000 invested in Apple just 20 years ago would be worth over $600k now. While I don\u2019t know if these same gains will be true for the future, I suspect both Apple and Microsoft will continue to outperform most funds. I could be wrong, but I wouldn\u2019t sell. I\u2019m actually trying to fix some past mistakes- my late father gave me a small portfolio many years ago, heavily invested in funds. If he had put the same money into Apple and Microsoft, I would have no financial worries today. The funds actually hold quite a bit of those two stocks, but the growth has paled in comparison.

I tend to think that buying good companies is rarely something you regret, and it isn\u2019t priced stratospherically high either. As far as addressing that Buffett bought at share prices less than 140 dollars amd isn\u2019t buying at todays prices, it\u2019s because apple is nearly half of Berkshires portfolio. How much more could he buy without being dangerously lopsided as far as diversification?"

     "I have been seeing YouTubers, Redditors, and CNBC bring on a bunch of \u201cexperts\u201d talking about this upcoming earnings. You would think with all this talk about it if Apple misses it would mean the end of the entire market. People are going crazy about it right now and this is my opinion.\n\nApple has always had periods of booms and busts. One year would be really great and the next meh. It has always been like this. The last 2 years have been phenomenal for them so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if we see a slowdown in electronic sales. Right now computer sales have had a big decline across the world. We see this in the Microsoft earnings. Microsoft did really bad in their computers and general hardware in their recent earnings. \n\nWith all this will it surprise me that Apple misses? No. Will it be the heat death of the universe if they do? No. Will it surprise me if Apple beats either? No. Apple has always had a history of beating peoples expectations and it would not surprise me if hardware sales do not decline as much as Microsoft\u2019s due to the strength that the Apple ecosystem has shown in the past.\n\nApple has also been moving more towards subscriptions and financial services. Very high margins and so far has been growing every single quarter. This can probably also soften the blow if there is a decline in the hardware side of their business. \n\nThe way I look at it is whatever happens happens. If we see a beat I am ok with it. If we see a decline I am also ok with it. I can see it going both ways however I want to lean more towards a miss. Apple is currently approaching all time highs and I would love to see the stock pull back some so I can add to my current position."

Not that their OS is great either, it's just so embedded in enterprise software that companies have no choice but to use it. Once everything goes browser based SaaS, their OS sales are going to tank as well, which isn't a bad thing for them exactly as they had enough foresight to embrace cloud services. MS cloud based services are pretty much the best around for enterprise but they are going to lack the staying power since migrating to other platforms won't be as much of a challenge as it is now.\n\nApple continues to not give 2 shits about enterprise and focuses solely on the consumer market... but then again, as things move towards browser based applications it might not matter as much."

  "Text": "b\"Apple's recent financial performance and position in the AI industry have raised some red flags. Despite generating significant revenue, Apple's gross margin percentage has seen a decline, and its heavy spending on share buybacks might suggest a lack of better investment opportunities.  \\nAdditionally, while Apple has been investing in AI, they seem to be falling behind. Their acquisitions in the field haven't yet translated into significant progress, which may suggest difficulties in integrating these acquisitions or a lack of strategic focus.  \\nIt's crucial for us to keep a critical eye on these developments.

About on par with the iPhone, the Web and PCs before that. It really feels like they (and Google and Amazon) bet on the wrong horse with their AI types. Though, to be fair to them and the rest of the world, almost no one knew LLM would be this useful and Siri/Alexa/GA have a different role to fill (practical, narrow field).\n\nAs a shareholder, I\u2019m not sure WWDC is going to bring us what we need, but as a fan I\u2019m really curious about what their solution to VR/AR(?) is going to be.

You people should start noticing how the companies make money and not just their P/E or how much they fell YTD.\n\nNvidia will also fall more because of China sanctions, Ethereum switching to proof of stake and global recession ahead. The stock was crazy overvalued after the massive rally post Covid (which I have contributed and made lots of money, but I sold everything months ago).\n\nI don't see much upside from Apple, IMHO the stock will underperform the market in the next 5 years. It's a huge, mature company right now with limited growth potential.\n\nMicrosoft is definitely the best one among those because of their cloud business, their Microsoft Office business (which is extremely resilient even in a recession because companies can't function without it) and their expansion into gaming with Activision Blizzard acquisition. They are also active (and expanding) in some professional software for data management which can net good money in the future. Of course Microsoft is also a huge, mature company but it has more room to grow than Apple. And it's safe even in a recession because their revenue are more recession proof compared to Google, Nvidia and even Apple (which sells to consumers for the most part)."

Plus, many of these teams have \"Not Invented Here\" mentality which has lead to a serious duplication of work.  In the last decade they have launched nearly half a dozen operating systems.  Another example would be Google Stadia's, which ran on a Windows compatibility layer on Linux, did not use any Wine or Proton code what so ever.  The engineers justification for doing so was so they could learn how compatibility layers work.  \nBecause they clearly do not have a road map, and siloed internally they lack a clear vision for the company.  Hopefully someone eventually comes in and makes these changes because while it may be profitable, it's clearly not run very well at all."

I can't get myself to put new money into a 2+ trillion dollar market cap mega corp  with 400B+ in revenue that needs to keep growing double digits and maintain margin in this new interest rate regime where the risk free return of doing nothing with your cash is 5%. What growth multiples are expected from a tech company in both hardware and software services when the risk free return is 5% with higher rates and  international sales numbers are being  impacted by a stronger dollar?"

We could see an opportunity to buy Apple at a great discount before this expected economic crisis is over ( a lifetime opportunity).\n\nIt depends on the type of return you want to make, if you want to make high ROI, then its good to wait and buy in the middle of the upcoming economic crisis. It seems impossible today, but considering where things are headed, we could eventually see Apple fall below $100. That's only a 30% drop. Enough bad news can make that happen.

I was just so convinced that this 28 multiple with 2% revenue growth was going to reverse.  Especially if they increase the price on iphones, how can you justify spending so much when its going to be a recession.  Just felt way overbought.  Every hedge fund is feeling the recession fear in 2023 and wants to hide some place and I think that is what is driving this crazy multiple right now.  Plus the AAPL event coming up in early september.  \\n\\nAnd today it got upgraded and 2 bucks away from where it started the year.  \\n\\nYou cant believe the kind of FOMO I am feeling right now to just go and buy it.

     "OP here: I see some posts here that seem to indicate that AAPL has to fall along with the broader market. Why should that be the case always? \n\nI see that AAPL is one of the most well run companies around. They make premium products and sell to the \u201cmasses\u201d. My 2012 iPad still works fine. iPhone 6 is still working fine though Apple recently classified that as a vintage product. They have built a terrific ecosystem of software develops and accessories makers across the globe. I work is tech and I have not used anything other than Mac since 2009. And that is likely the case in many big tech companies outside Microsoft. Me and many I know are so entrenched in the Apple ecosystem with our iPhones , iPads, Apple Watches, macs, Appletv and apps that getting out is nearly impossible.  \n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nOn another note: I have not bought Apple stock since 2013. All my investments in the last few years have been broad market ETFs. VTI/VUG/VIG/VTV.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m an active buyer. I only buy blue chip stocks that I believe I can hold for the next decade peacefully. I did trade some speculative stocks and lost. (PYPL, BABA, PLTR mainly). I decided that I\u2019m a better investor and a horrible trader."

How much of a correction is coming when they badly miss on earnings expectations after people don\u2019t get iPads and new iPhones this holiday season? \n\n2. For my portfolio, personally, I am mainly an index investor. I buy VTI and VXUS in my Roth, and mutual fund equivalents in my other retirement accounts. If Apple falls, it tends to already bring down the rest of my holdings. I\u2019m divesting to move to other things in my individual stock account. \n\nI\u2019m absolutely a bull about that company in general though.

  "Text": "b'The earning season really shows how strong Apple is toward consumer. Apple has been historically seen as a phone company, but it is now building its own privacy complaint ad platform, running its own TV shows, doing chip design, CarPlay OS, its firing all cylinders in entertainment, device, fitness, and now credit card and finances, primarily due to its proprietary control of the operating system. \\n\\nWith the declining Android/PC sales but increasing iPhone/mac sales, its just a matter of time the grip Apple has over other consumer big / medium tech grows as Apple pursue complete domination of operating systems adoption through the world. Sure Apple doesnt offer enterprise and cloud compute yet, but if we just focus on consumer, you cant really long both Apple and its competitors cant you? Meaning, if you are buying META you are basically betting against AAPL, so on and so forth..'",

I'm also concerned that AAPL nearing ATHs could once again be signalling peak market bullishness.\\n\\nI sold half my position on Friday and I'm curious to hear what others are thinking about this stock and the recent bullishness we've seen in the tech stocks generally.\"",

With $6-8 bill in sales delayed due to supply chains (they stated this the last two quarters), that will be realized as things improve. I assume that will pad the numbers even if they come below the revenue or earnings.\n\nIf rumors are true, they will be announcing the glasses within the next 12 months, which will be the catalyst to take it to 200. \n\nExpect a higher PE until earnings/share buybacks catch up. Also, their services were 20% of their revenue Q2. With a happy and satisfied installed base of over 1 Bill device owners, I would expect services to continue growing.

     "I get the impression that big tech companies are being pressured to expand in all directions to maintain the 'innovative' perception they have among shareholders, even if the expansion doesn't make sense. Is Apple trying to become a bank? Should Google get into grocery delivery now? \n\nI wonder if this really is the best use of Apple's money or just what happens when a company is making so much money it just expands in every direction (GE?). Why not just buy back more shares or put toward the primary business which are actually doing well. JPMorgan has a fortress balance sheet but I don't think they should be getting into self driving cars.\n\nMaybe unrelated but I see a sentiment whenever companies announce 'expansions' or 'new acquisitions' and everyone's first take is: \"ooh exciting, idk what this has implications for but business is growing, buy buy buy.\" Elon Musk is disrupting the restaurant sector!! Amazon is going to take over the drone space!"

     "One could look at this through the concept of bond yields to earnings ratio.\n\nApple's P/E of 25 was (go calculate new one) quite expensive if bonds keep doing their thing. That's the problem for a lot of this kind of stocks now. Throw in the thought that earnings might even drop, with China shutdown, recession, people not affording luxury goods...\n\n**A P/E of 25 represents the same yield as a 4% yielding bond. And the 10 year bond has crossed 3% already.** So if the \"risk free\" bond is almost the same, stock will extremely likely lose value as that comparison approaches. A drop in earnings will VERY quickly flip this situation to an even worse situation.\n\n**Your bonus yield for holding a stock over a \"risk-free\" bond would only be 1% yearly now. A lot of big money will not like this proposition.**\n\n**Stocks with over 30 P/E are basically already break-even and in extreme danger. They would need exceptionally trusting investors who trust that earnings growth will keep happening and the company keeps outgrowing this competition from the bonds**\n\nAnd remember, we are talking about company earnings in a potentially very difficult market in the future. Not their current earnings! That is the difficulty.\n\nI myself have transitioned last year towards stocks with around P/E of 10. Could think of those that bonds would have to yield 10% to overtake them. Every stock will get hit in an accelerating manner as the break-even approaches, but cheaper earnings right now and their expected continuity helps dampen the fall.\n\nTLDR: with this justification could see Apple drop even -20%, IF they whiff on high earnings growth in the next earnings report and bond rise does not settle down. Though can throw in some \"safety bonus\" because it is Apple."

Two quick examples of mine:\\n\\n1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.\\n\\n2.

It\u2019s still the most misunderstood company on the market IMO, and I\u2019m glad it is.\n\nThere was a time where I considered investing in Apple and Nvidia, but the 2020 breakout for Tesla was just too evident, and the next breakout is even more predictable.\n\nThis might sound strange but inevitable things are actually inevitable. Look at technological trend and where the demand will be. The recent deal with Ford revealed a lot more than what was in the news headlines."

Hoping they can grow their higher margin software lines? etc. All legit possibilities, but not guaranteed)\n\nWith that in mind, You might want to trim *out* of Apple, but I'd still hold most of it. Not sure how risky you want to be, but it may be worthwhile trimming about 25-50k a month and buying VOO until you get down to 500k in Apple or so. Slowly DCA out of AAPL and into the S&P basically.\n\nI'm not going to recommend you any specific stocks, but I do think they are slightly overvalued and in the long run it's worth slowly getting all of your eggs out of a single basket. I still like them long term and definitely worth holding a significant position there.\n\nIf you're more income oriented, could easily put some into SCHD or JEPI along with VOO. Maybe eventually aim for 100k in each of those along with your remaining 400-500k in Apple and you'd have a lot more downside risk protection in the long run IMO."

     "I would suggest reading up on the following topics:\n\n* **Creating equity collars via options contracts** (ie selling a call and using the proceeds to purchase puts). There are potential tax consequences to this strategy that require extra attention. You really don't want to convert a long-term cap gain into a short term cap gain due to lack of attention.\n\n* **Building a completion portfolio** (ie diversifying by steering additional purchases or proceeds of sales into positions that round out your exposures). You'll want to pay attention to the cost basis of specific lots when planning sales. You'll also want to pay attention to correlations between Apple and any new positions (eg Energy or Healthcare is going to help more than a consumer discretionary or tech related firm). \n\n* **Exchange mutual funds** These funds facilitate diversification by permitting a stock owner to deposit their shares into a fund in exchange for shares of the fund. Your cost basis in the new fund shares will be that of your deposited stock. Sometimes they have fairly high net worth requirements, and they often have lock up provisions. I'm not crazy about them, but suggest that you learn about them to be aware of the pros and cons versus other strategies.\n\nI strongly recommend that you explore working with a professional wealth manager that is willing to help you draft an investment policy statement and talk to you about the concept of risk buckets. It can really help keep things in focus.\n\nI further suggest that you try to avoid firms that are really into a boiler plate process at the expense of personalized advice. They are more likely to try and convince you to simply convert things over on their terms and to gloss over details that have huge tax implications at your expense. \n\nFor what it's worth, one of the well-worn clich\u00e9s in investment management goes something like this: *If you want to make a lot of money, having all of your money in one great stock can get you there. If you want to keep a lot of money, make sure you're diversified.*\n\nI know that my post reads like a homework assignment, but I think those topics will serve you well. They're also potentially tricky. Feel free to dm me if you have questions."

You're in your 30's so that 730K position can grow handsomely just by reinvested dividends over the years. You made a smart (or lucky) decision, held it through some volatility, and it certainly paid off. Don't take on any more risk than you need to. You should be able to take a couple mill in 20 years and live the rest of your life comfortably off the dividends."

Heres a long term perspective to consider.\\n\\nAAPL is now down 30%, but a return to all time high means a 183/129 = 42% return. If youre happy with an average annual return of 10%, then buying now means AAPL has 4 years to get back to ATH in order for it to be a good investment for you. \\n\\nObviously a faster return to ATH gives an even better average return. (I oversimplify the math a little by ignoring compounding)\\n\\nA similar analysis on these blue chips shows that a return to ATH in,\\n\\n- MSFT: 4.5 years\\n\\n- GOOG: 5 years\\n\\n- AMZN: 8 years\\n\\nWould equate to an average annual return of ~10%. \\n\\nIf your time horizon is more than a few years, these are great times to be in the market.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Most people seem to think I'm legitimately asking the question in the title. I'm not, this is a way to mentally reframe the market outlook without any real analysis (just simple math). Enjoy the stock sale.\"",

On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.\\n\\nA lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA.

     "The fed tightening is an X factor for sure, maybe the tighten too fast and raise interest too fast and we get a recession. But ask yourself this, for how long?\n\nThe war in Ukraine matters little for Apple's business. It's not a huge part of their sales and any supply issues that come from that won't be huge; Apple has been dealing with supply issues for the past 2 years and navigating them easily.\n\nFor the 10 year yield, Apple has opportunity to grow more than 2-3% per year within that time frame so how many people are really going to care about the yield? Some for sure especially those closer to retirement but would you really trade the potential in Apple for a 2-3% yield over time? u/Malamonga1 also correctly pointed out that this changes the DCF model so that higher returns are to be expected which I think can happen with what I discussed. \n\nCompanies have shown that they can pass their costs onto consumers so unless we have a financial crisis, Apple's costs are going to be passed on. Even during a financial crisis their products are quasi luxury and luxury goods tend to fare better.\n\nThe fed tightening is an X factor for sure, maybe the tighten too fast and raise interest too fast and we get a recession. But ask yourself this, for how long? The big companies like apple have had the best debt levels in years, in the sense their interest rates are low and debt service is low. They have stupid amounts of cash to invest so they are primed to easily weather recessions.\n\nLastly, Apple's potential is what really does it for me. Increase in revenue from services, potentially licensing hardware, content for movies and shows, electric vehicles, glasses, and whatever other product they'll get in to. I don't think people understand how much money apple makes compared to how many products they have. Glasses alone would increase their revenue by billions. And then there is of course the potential for innovations that tech companies make that can make them money in ways we can't think of right now. And, if you look at their revenue, you see crazy growth in in 2021 and that's likely to continue in 2022 and that's WITH supply chain issues.\n\nOne more thing as well, share buy backs and dividends. \n\nSo yeah, I'm for Apple as an investment and they're current multiples don't scare me away based on what I see for their future. I just DCA small amounts every once in a while when I can and don't plan on stopping."

They\u2019re also establishing long-term partnerships with companies like Sony and SEGA among many others to utilize their Azure cloud service on long-term contracts.

Google is the strongest, most UNBEATABLE name in information gathering/utilization/creation etc. That means Google will forever have demand and a huge competitive advantage.\n\nThis impacts many different fields that I don't have time to write about. The two most important ones though are advertising and AI. On those two topics, Google has an unchallenged lead, and will continue having an unchallenged lead basically forever. There's just no competing with Google's quality and quantity of information at this point.\n\n\n2. Income diversification: \n\nAlthough this point is true also for FB and MSFT, it is truest for Google: a US/dollar collapse will not affect Google as badly as most US based companies, because it has guaranteed non- dollar denominated income from across every continent, which will continue streaming also in difficult economic times. In a stagflation environment (which is the greatest risk right now for many countries including America) you want to have this kind of diversification. \n\n3. R&D:\n\nGoogle's R&D team is creating some fascinating research on a wide variety of topics. In the last year, for example, they used AI to solve a long- unsolved question about the 3D structure of protein folding, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. With superior data, superior engineers/ AI experts, and a company policy of allowing their workers to pursue interesting problems, Google is slowly gathering more and more breakthroughs to its name."

     "i started buying AAPL in 2015. This came after realizing a had a trading addiction. I was destroying myself financially by YOLOing before Robinhood made it fashionable. I disabled options trading ( except for put writing/ covered calls ),  and studied both Bogleheads and Buffet. So I have benefited enormously from AAPL - there were a lot of pullbacks during the last 6 years, and sideways trading periods. but I took on the Buffet notion of stocks as owning assets in a company and not as abstract symbols where you focus on the ups and downs of price, but look at the long term.   i held through it all, ignored the 2020 crash and just kept going about my life.. obviously the time since then has accelerated everything greatly.  My apple shares unrealized gains are spectacular. Are we finally \"too toppy\" at 180 and a 3 trillion dollar market cap? Maybe, but i find it hard to pull the trigger. Not just because I still believe in AAPL for the next few years, even if there is a pullback, but also because it feels like selling would be going back to the old me that tried to time the market. Maybe I am foolish but until Berkshire dumps its 40 percent portfolio share of AAPL I might reconsider.. until then maybe it is better to just remind myself that stocks are going to  both down and up but the real question is .. what will it be worth 5 years out?"

Even Microsoft has a higher PE ratio then Apple as well but no one seems to bat an eye on their run up. Apple has had slower growth this year compared to Microsoft and Google so it seems like after consolidation Apple has broke out. \n\nYes, Apple's PE ratio currently is higher than it's been at 31 and growth for the next two years is going to be sluggish but the prospects of Apple's next wave of innovation and the flight for safety is driving this run up. Apple has developed their reputation that everything they throw out on the market turns into gold so it's probably safe to say the new AR glasses which will come out in the next 18 months most likely will be the new hot thing along with a gateway to the metaverse and whatever that entails. Then the Apple car which isn't coming out soon but if it does come out may just revolutionize driving. The apple ecosystem is a titan. Then other aspects like strong stock buyback over the years and a very healthy balance sheet has ensured Apple to be the safest stock.\n\nI think Apple stock will stagnate for the next two years as growth will be somewhat limited in the next two years and YoY comparisons won't look too good but once their next wave of products start to hit in 2023 or so Apple may just add another trillion or so. This is a long term hold and you don't bet against Apple."

This is a major chunk of revenue that is likely going to be greatly diminished before long. Revenue that had the highest profit margin and lowest overhead of any of their revenue generators may be going away. Once more 3rd party app developers understand that they do not have to give apple 30% of in app purchases anymore, your going to see a lot more \"light\" versions of apps show up in the store that are baseline functional, but will require in app purchases directly through their 3rd party sites(bypassing apple and their skimming off the top) to unlock the full featured program. As it stands 70% of in app revenue that apple was taking was mostly from a handful of free to play mobile games(such as EPIC's Fortnight) that can now offer customers the ability to pay for in app purchases directly from the developer, cutting apple out of the purchase. Some will even be willing to incentivize costumers doing so by charging them less to go direct, rather than through apple's portals."

So much is wrapped into these two companies in the SP500, especially for Apple.\n\nGoogle has a higher chance in my opinion to drop more. Apple could like any stock could drop that much\u2026 but this would knock down SP500 3% by itself. Every paycheck, there\u2019s a fight to make these stocks go higher\u2026.\n\nFor perspective, the SP500 would need to drop further than what it did for COVID\u2019s bottom. The PE would be roughly 10 for each\u2026 which is possible, but I think the internet changed things and people know anything under 15 PE is a bargain.

Big surprise for me. \n\nMac sales had a massive decline. This is what people were expecting considering previous earnings of the other tech companies we saw from computer sales. \n\niPad also declined but not as bad as I was expecting.\n\nWearables and accessories was flat which still shows there is resilience even in this slowing economy. \n\nServices increased again. This was to be expected and helped soften the blow from the declines in other divisions like Mac and iPad. \n\nDeclines of sales in the Americas, China, and Japan. However increases in both Europe and the Rest of Asia Pacific.\n\nThey also announced a 4% increase in their dividend as well as a massive 90 billion dollar stock buyback. \n\nOverall I am completely fine with the quarter especially giving the low expectations people had which you can see in the expectation\u2019s Wall-Street had.

     "The run by the S&P5~~00~~ has been great this year but I think everyone realizes it's mostly been driven by tech. So I was curious to see how much of the gains can be attributed to the big 6 tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, GOOG, META). I did a calculation were these 6 tech stocks had 0% gains this year. Based on my calculations (which could be wrong) these 6 stocks alone have contributed approximately 327 points to the S&P500 this year! If these 6 stocks had no gains this year, then the S&P 500 would be at approximately 3823, which interestingly is the same price the S&P 500 was at the beginning of the year (3824). This is all based on yesterday's data and might not have been calculated correctly. In the same time the S&P500 equal weight index was negative YTD (-1.00%) yesterday."

     "Today  I added to BTU, AMR, a micro-cap, and sold some AMD. Commodities are wrecking a lot of people it seems, but it is a risky category. One day I'd like to share the story about this microcap because the amount of incredible DD and the story of how government officials/IR are accidentally leaking very very material information is just so entertaining. If the stock quintuples like there's a reasonable chance of happening, I'll be happy to tell the tale.\n\nWhy has BTU been so disappointing? They have so much cash, like $1.8B right? That's about half their market cap. Well they completed their surety negotiations (surety referring to the fact that all coal companies have to post collateral for future 'reclamation' of the land) and other debt covenants were cleared.\n \nProblem is some $900M is required as collateral going forward, $500M has to be posted as liquidity requirement, and the management is choosing to hold onto another $400M for their own conservative cash management. So suddenly the amount of available cash is not so high. So the buybacks have to come from high FCF going forward, which requires thermal pricing not to melt down. Now I think at today's prices it is a good deal, but... so are other coal names. Had so much cash not been tied up, sure, it would have been an easy double, to $35-40 a share. But the imminent catalyst is really much less exciting. Long term holders will likely see excellent returns in all coal names, but right now, with thermal pricing going down the drain, being optimistic is difficult. At least their small buyback (5-7% of float a quarter?) will be able to suck up even more shares. There are some technicalities about convertible debt but tbh I don't fully understand it. Some credit experts on Twitter are saying BTU is never going to get favorable terms on that to be able to take it out.\n\nI'm not adding a lot of BTU, as I have a comfortable sized position--enough that I don't really care if it keeps falling. AMR I have a very large position but at a cost basis I'm very happy with (148). I'm willing to hold AMR for 2-3 years no matter what. I would care if AMR falls another 20% from here though..."

Buying large companies like AAPL and GOOG increases your weight in those companies and your reliance on them to continue to grow. A true lower risk strategy would be buying VOO, a foreign etf, and a small/mid cap etf. Diversification is the key to lower risk. \n\nHaving said that, if you want low risk just buy bonds. It\u2019ll hurt your expected returns greatly but it\u2019s the only true low risk thing out there."

This increased demand for products, a lag in supply and combined with government stimulus caused inflation. Prior to the Russian invasion inflation was quite bad and with the invasion our governments are less likely to raise interest rates to slow demand, so prices will continue to increase at the current rate of inflation (stagflation) or increased inflation (hyperinflation). As prices across the board (food, oil, real estate, rent and luxury) increase, which sectors will the lower/middle class allocate their money? My bet is on food and not big tech. Also looking at the technical analysis of big tech you'd be catching a falling knife."

     "Does anyone even care about a stock that isn't Apple? Or tech? You don't *have* to buy the most well-known company on earth ya know...\n\nAnyway CF, a nitrogen fertilizer producer, had a nice day today. Not exactly sure why. I see Dutch TTF (European natural gas prices) are up 20% for July's contract, while BOIL is up 6% in the US. A differential in natural gas prices (an input into nitrogen fertilizer production) would benefit CF as European producers pull back. But lower gas prices are better in absolute terms.\n\nUltimately oil stocks pulled back. A unilateral OPEC cut is going nowhere. Saudi Arabia is not going to single-handedly tighten the entire oil market without the help of the rest of OPEC and Russian compliance. Today's price action won't say much about H2, though. Even the cuts from April took a while to actually hit oil production data: watch the 'cargo loadings' data to see if OPEC exports are falling or not. It takes 1-2 months for oil to ship from S. Arabia to US, for example.\n\nSmall cap value gave up some of its Friday gains."

I am sure we have all been seeing the ads, but it was just a thought and wanted some outside opinions. I am also sure it'll slowly go down as people are displeased with the products and ordering system, which is very much like Alibaba. But for a short squeeze?"

The thing I see about MSFT, GOOGL, META is that theyre not consumer driven like Apple and may be somewhat more immune to inflation and recession fears than Apple, which does have services, but are not as big a piece of the pie. \\n\\nApple is gone up near vertical over the past month in the face of an onslaught of bad news. It sits at a 2.5 trillion market cap. The other aforementioned tech stocks have fallen from their highs but not Apple. In fact, its only about 10% from its ATH, which I think is absolutely insane given all thats happened over the past year and half. \\n\\nSo what do you think earnings will bring?

I\u2019m 28 now and there is no other operating system I am fluent in. ( I work in the entertainment industry) If there is one thing I\u2019m confident in, it\u2019s Apple. That doesn\u2019t mean they will have the best returns in the next 5 years over other companies, but I feel incredibly safe with Apple. I use their phone, iPad mini for work, MacBook Pro, AirPods and Apple Watch. If they had their own home security cameras I would own those too. I am fully enveloped in their eco system and so are most people that I know. I too will continue to buy shares of Apple. It\u2019s a company that I feel I can\u2019t live without and in the end when I cash out, Apple gains will have paid for all of my Apple products."

I am not saying it will go to 12, but it might go to 16/17.\n\nFED will start the quantitative tightening next month removing 9T of its balance sheet every month. It's gonna be the opposite of printing money. That 9T is just the start, it might be more in the future.\n\nCorporate investors are 80% of the market. They now have access to better bonds unlike during Covid. They can have a really good bond giving 5% return with low risk. Those insitutional investors prefer a 5% safe over a risky 15%. So the bond market is now taking investments that was previously in the stock market.\n\nI still don't see a crash for the stock market however."

     "Today I bought AMR and a little more of a micro-cap. \n\nI saw a comment about BTU disappointing--totally agree, I'm also disappointed. But I'm also not selling. Coal stocks are highly risky but I'm looking for multibaggers not a little 10-20% return. My initial thesis was that we would immediately see certain steps taken by the company that would lead to a massive re-rating, but instead we found out that they will still keep an enormous sum of cash locked up for the time being (even though they are no longer contractually obligated to). On top of that the broader commodity pricing is deteriorating, with both met and thermal pricing in recession, weak Chinese demand, and extremely cheap natural gas. [That's why AMR + ARCH + CEIX is also trading down, not just BTU for being a shitco-al company] I'm willing to wait for the cycle to turn up again, and I still don't buy recession fears. Hence I buy moar. \n\nRegarding met pricing, there are seasonalities causing the underlying commodity price to fall. We exited 'restocking season' in late April, and demand should be weak until monsoon season ends and India picks up the slack. (End of summer) Also keep in mind that there are different qualities of met coal, with the lower quality material coming from Mongolia/China earning a discount to premium Aussie coal, for instance."

Bears think hyperinflation is coming.\n\nI'm a rare bull that thinks moderate inflation is basically here to stay for a while but extremely unlikely to spiral out of control.  Basically Fed will step in periodically to prevent that if needed.  Otherwise they let it just play out.\n\nRegardless this post isn't about that.  I learned a very important lesson about gold.  After the Ukraine invasion, I bought a small amount GLD, like $10k at around $185.  Now it didn't actually run THAT much from pre-invasion which was like high 170s so I thought this is a good inflation hedge. \n\nWell despite many high surprise prints in CPI after, it just kept going down, down, down.  I bagheld that mfer all the way to $150.\n\nJust goes to show A) don't invest in crap that doesn't produce anything and B) more importantly it's impossible to know how much inflation is already priced into it so don't buy it as a hedge for that.  Unlike companies which earnings power can push through inflation, gold cannot do this.\n\nHave no idea where it's going from here but I finally got a chance to dump it green at $189 for a miniscule profit and couldn't be happier.  It's a pure gamble as to what goldbugs want."

Their new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple announcing the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years.\\n\\nToday, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.\\n\\nEDIT: Wow this post blew up. Anyways, with earning reports coming later this week, anyone know if AAPL \\\\*historically\\\\* tanks or skyrockets after the earning reports are released? Would like some sources and may hold off until purchasing shares after they're released. Also considering my age, I will just dump\"",

I asked him if he thought the price of platinum would rise as much as gold or silver and he said (and this is why I liked the guy) there was almost no way.

     "Buying the biggest companies in the world has historically not been a winning strategy over the long term, no matter how impenetrable their moats are at the moment. (I'm sure someone will share that graphic of the top market cap companies over time) The amount of runway for $1T, $2T companies just doesn't compare to what is possible with $500M, $10B market cap companies. I don't want to just buy the past winners, but buy the future ones. This is why the core strategy of my portfolio are large tilts to small cap (value) stocks, which is both riskier but also has higher rewards in the long run. They are also a hedge when big tech hits a wall, like happened post-Dot Com. [Take a look at 2000-1](https://i.imgur.com/xIpUKyL.png) in this table of small cap value versus the broader market in down years.\n\nI like buying big tech 'tactically', as they do have rock solid balance sheets and moats, so when they do dip (irrationally), I buy them. This rewarded me greatly in 2022, as I doubled down on \n\n- GOOG (+25%, 2% of port.)\n- META (+60%, 2.6% of port.)\n- MSFT (+17%, 2.8% of port.)\n- AAPL (+19%, 1.9% of port.)\n- SMH (+24%, 1.4% of port)\n- AMD (+12%, 2.5% of port.)\n\nYes I didn't time the bottom perfectly or I'd be much richer. I had opened up positions on these in 2021-2, and either averaged down from expensive levels or bought when I felt was too cheap. AMD/MSFT were among my worst timed purchases. But these are not necessarily long term holds since I already have exposure through index funds and I think they are fairly to over-valued now."

Reason for this is frankly pretty depressing - debt is possibly at a point of no return, politics getting more and more problematic, and likely either party will only increase debt, 500 basis point increase in fed rate after a decade of almost 0 rate has consequences that haven\u2019t even been revealed, social security will be an issue pretty soon (Stanley druckenmiller predicts sometime 2025-2035, my vote on it being earlier than later), de-globalization and de-dollarization has only just started. Those are just the things at the top of my mind, I could come up with more. \n\nBtw I have never once held gold anytime before so I\u2019m not a long term gold bull just trying to sell the idea. I\u2019ve only just recently started a position in this asset class. Some would say in this case you should get bitcoin instead but i personally have doubt about bitcoin and would rather go with gold that has historically proven itself."

     "While your end conclusion might be right, this analysis is unfortunately very flawed.\n\nFirst of all, they have been buying back a lot of shares. I mean tens of billions worth of stock every year. This means that every share outstanding now owns a larger part of the company's revenue and earnings. So while you are analyzing the growth of total revenue, you should be looking at the growth of revenue per share and earnings per share. That is, if you are comparing revenues to Apple's stock price.\n\nSecondly, not every $ sold is valued the same. As an owner of a company you shouldn't focus solely on the top line *(=Revenue)* but rather on what's left for you once everything is paid *(=Net Income/FCF depending on your angle)*. In Apple's case, the revenue stream that is growing the fastest is Services. And because their gross margins on Services is somewhere around 70% while it is around 35% for Products, every Service revenue $ is double as valuable (compared to Products). This is the same phenomenon we are seeing with Amazon and their AWS cloud segment which is highly more profitable than the E-Commerce side.\n\nThere are naturally other factors in play, such as interest rates (*desperate need to find returns on this newly available piles of cash causing multiple expansion*), politics (*Right-to-repair & limiting the power of Tech giants*) but I haven't investigated Apple deeply enough to chip in on those issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple (along with other tech giants) have witnessed huge multiple (P/S, P/E etc.) expansions during the last few years and could very easily be overvalued. However, a simple analysis of a company top line doesn't tell us anything of value."

     "It's certainly an interesting theory, and probably true to some extent. However, my thoughts:\n\n1) The transition from Intel-based Macs to M1 is still mid-way through. There's still the 27\" iMac replacement due as well as the top-end Mac Pro. There's a ton of people holding out for these. Self-employed designers and filmmakers, right up to small and mid-sized studios who probably last updated to the 2018 iMac Pro.\n\n2) Going on from that, there's still barely enough stock to meet demand of the newly released 14\" and 16\" MBP which are absolute game-changers for the company. Once supply chain issues are worked out, these will sell like hot cakes.\n\n3) Potential new product categories - though they may not launch this year, any announcement of AR Glasses or a Car will bound to create a ton of buzz around the company and drive interest.\n\n4) A ton of apps are dropping support for iOS 12, including mammoths like WhatsApp, Netflix etc. The iPhone 6 is locked to iOS 12, and a huge amount of people are still rocking those. They're now feeling pressured to update to a new iPhone to continue using their favourite apps.\n\nI think the 2020 surge of sales was definitely beneficial, but mostly for the MBA and MBP and mid-range iPads. Stuff that sells itself anyway."

The Apple car being the biggest example of this, but Apple VR/glasses hype has also driven up the stock price. There's major risks with both of these projects that aren't being acknowledged by the market. People are just assuming that because it's Apple of course they can make a car or a robotaxi work, or of course people will want to buy smartglasses from them even though Google Glasses failed miserably in the market despite all the hype before it was released.\n\nWhenever the EV bubble pops Apple is almost certainly going to see a big drop in share price because of this."

Sure, they may have inventory sitting in storages for now, but is it enough to supply projected sales? No. October 2021 showed their vulnerability when they lost $6B in revenue due to chip shortage. 52% of net sales are iPhones alone. I\u2019m not going to think there\u2019s enough in WIP Inventory to supply what they need eventually. They probably estimated the inventory life for semis at like 24+ days.\n\nPlus, if and when Taiwan gets invaded, US is probably going to sanction off trade to China and given that China represents 10% of current customer segment, that\u2019s a blow.\n\nTheir stocks are overvalued - doesn\u2019t make sense how they can all of a sudden gets so hyper overinflated between the periods you pointed out.

It\u2019s also hard to wrap your head around what such a thing could look like. For example if spy rallies 20% in q1 and then drops 10% in q2 and then rallies 20% in q3, how bad do you feel about that 10% correction in the middle of an overall 30% gain in the market? \nAs for your allocation I wouldn\u2019t worry about such small percentage allocations. I\u2019d say you\u2019re fine. If you\u2019re long stocks then it\u2019s pretty much all the same result and results improve as long as you stick to the high liquidity.

     "Investing in stocks requires careful consideration of various factors, including an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance, investment goals, and thorough research.\r  \n\r  \nIn the event of a market decline, investors often look for opportunities to buy stocks that they believe are undervalued or have strong long-term potential. However, the choice of a specific stock to buy during a market drop would depend on individual investment strategies and preferences.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to conduct thorough research, analyze the fundamentals of a company, consider its industry outlook, and assess other relevant factors before making any investment decisions. Consulting with a financial advisor or investment professional who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances is highly recommended.\r  \n\r  \nRemember, investing in stocks involves risks, and it's important to make informed decisions based on your own analysis and understanding of the market."

It seems everyone is hoarding cash or parked in treasuries/money market funds waiting for the next crash whereas last year this wouldn't have been the case with the lower yields. \n\nI don't see how we can have any sort of meaningful crash when there is so much money on the sidelines waiting. Are people really waiting for SP 3300-3500 to jump back in. It seems any dips we have from here will have so much buying pressure with all the cash waiting on the sidelines. At what point do people start fomoing when the market is dropping.\n\nCramer is even saying to keep some cash and wait for a drop from the debt ceiling. If everyone is doing the same thing is it really going to happen?\n\nIt seems like if this debt ceiling gets resolved and the FDIC came out and stopped short selling against banks or guaranteed deposits this market could take off. With so much money on the sidelines I could see a massive fomo rally."

AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.\\n\\nIt makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.\\n\\nAAPL is still up \\\\~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?\\n\\nHere are my 6 reasons:\\n\\n* **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.\\n* **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic\\n\"",

The insane amount of testing, regulation just to validate a compliant car design is on an entirely different level. Apple has never had to worry about human safety in a high speed crash event before. As a former Ford engineer, I can tell you its a pain in the ass and not very profitable even in the best of economies. I think theres a better chance they cancel the project rather than bring it to market."

     ">Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying \"Apple products are overpriced\" is no longer true\n\nYeah it is. Where do you think their profit margins come from? They're the definition of \"overpriced\".\n\nThen there's bullshit like the 999$ Pro Monitor stand, 19$ Cloth and other overpriced nick-nacks.\n\n\nYou buy a PC to have it configurable and easy to evolve. A MAC is bought once then dumped after its lifecycle is over.\n\nYeah they might have cheaper stuff now but for those prices you can easily buy something much more powerful. Last time I upgraded my phone I did look at the iPhone SE and I ended up choosing an android from Motorola anyway - had much bigger capacity, screen, better sound and was faster. \n\nFor all things audio there's nothing that is better than sony. Apple's earbuds took off because of branding - like much else they have - celebs were seen wearing them and they were easy to identify regardless of sports regulations forbidding their advertisement.\n\nM1 is legit a great improvement but it has a few catches: \n\n- programs have to be recompiled so they'll work on the new architecture.\n\n- industry will catch up to it eventually - a time benefit for apple but a cost benefit for everyone else as Apple's R&D spending and gearing up for production balanced it out\n\n- Apple is a pure garbage company when it comes to developers for their platforms: an increasing number of applications were \"stolen\" i.e. copied of ideas and deployed by them without their extra appstore fee they charge everyone else + they'll use stuff like privacy or other seemingly good topics to push against competition for ad revenue or any other sources of revenue. how long will they keep it up until devs get fed up with it and see themselves as targets & guinea pigs? microsoft got slapped for one big case like this in the 90s, Apple so far is staying clear but a reckoning will arrive.\n\nI've been involved with IT all my life and while I commend Apple for their achievements I wouldn't buy any of their products if I can help it - and fortunately for now I can. Microsoft or other industry players copying some of Apple's choices just piss me off on the regular - i hate the hamburger menu dumb-down ui, the constant push of form over function from the boxes and designs and they definitely shot themselves in the foot with the windows 11 look.\n\nThey're a good stock to own tho, for now."

     "Google is already up 6% and it was less than a week ago we found out about the split.\n\nI would expect Google share price to continue to appreciate faster than the overall market going in to the split.\n\nThe split will mean Google can join the DJIA which is a nice tailwind.\n\nBut just overall Google is just killing and you want to own.\n\nI thought Apple had a great quarter. Google put up over 3 times the growth rate of Apple!!\n\nout of all the FANGs you have Google growing by far the fastest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow.\n\nGoogle still has tons of assets that the have yet to monetize or fully monetized.\n\nTake Android. Over a billion devices activated per year and Google does not charge a cent. They could do a nominal license fee of $10 and add over $10 billion of revenue which really would be profit as it would not add any new expense.\n\nBut Android is just one example. Google has so many others which just make a massive runway for Google. So if growth starts to slow Google has plenty of levers to pull to keep it going for a very long time. Plus Google keeps adding new ones.\n\nPeople forget that Google is half the age of Microsoft and Apple. It is only a matter of time until Google passes Apple. They already blew past Microsoft. Google has more revenue and makes a lot more than Microsoft or Amazon or Facebook or Netflix. FANG is Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google.\n\nGoogle is also going to do a 20:1 stock split which means they can now join the DJIA. Probably replacing IBM but it could be CSCO (Cisco). That will also give an additional strong tailwind.\n\nBut the other thing really going for Google is the financial engineering. Google bought back over $50 billion in their own shares in 2021. That means less outstanding shares which then just increases EPS as there are less shares.\n\nGoogle had over $65 billion in free cash flow in 2021. They also have over $140 billion in cash just doing basically nothing. Google could really increase their buyback and that significantly decreases shares. So share price appreciations with Google basically doing nothing. Why they call it financial engineering.\n\nBTW, in the past people would say there is this law of large numbers. Which was such a croc. It was the reason given for Apple growth slowing. Well Google has finally put that to rest. The bigger Google gets the faster they grow. They are now an over $250 billion dollar business. Will be well over $300 billion next year.\n\nI am old but I have never seen a more amazing company. The fastest in history to get to 1 trillion market cap. Then the fastest to $2 trillion. Amazon is actually three years older than Google and why the records are with Google.\n\nPeople think Google genius is with their technology. But actually the most genius thing they did was using the dutch auction for search. That was just brilliant. It will also help them with the government as Google does not set price."

If you are willing to sell a long dated contract you can do fairly well on the premium collected. \n\nJust as an example Jan 2024 $15 strike price for .87 per share. Price currently 12.74 and dividend is .15 per quarter. So 3 dividends for .45 plus the  .87 premium is over a 10% gain right there.

     "Lately it is $AMR. They are a US-based producer of metallurgical (abbreviated 'met') coal that exports to over 25 countries. Met coal is a key input used for steel production--don't get confused with thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity and whose use is generally more controversial.\n\nThe company is highly undervalued, even for a cyclical coal mining company. It is in the process of reducing its share count by about 30%. To quote some statistics from mid-March: \"It has a market cap of 2.6B and has 300M in net cash. Its 2022 FCF was $1.3B. They have $1.2B remaining in share buybacks authorized, having already done $560M in buybacks since first authorization (beginning 2022 I believe). I'm seeing FCF/EV yields of 30-40%.\" [Read that once more: it generated half its entire market cap in FCF last year]\n\nIt's roughly fairly priced if met coal prices were at $200 a ton, which is the average from 2010-2020. However, actual met prices are currently much higher thanks to surging demand from India/China, as well as bullish sentiment about steel usage in the US thanks to recent fiscal stimulus. [By contrast, thermal coal prices have less of a runway ahead of them barring a terribly cold winter in 2023/4]. We can't replace met coal just yet to produce steel, unlike thermal coal for power generation. Thermal coal can be phased out provided we make the right investments in nuclear/solar/wind/geothermal/hydro/natural gas/crude oil/..., all of which are better for the environment than thermal coal. I believe scientists are still experimenting ways to find cleaner ways of producing steel, like using hydrogen or other new materials. But that's a few decades away.\n\n2023 hasn't posed much of a slowdown at all for AMR, and it locks in contracts at great prices well in advance. Management has made clear they have *no* plans of expansion or M&A and are focused on share buybacks.\n\nI own shares at $153 a share, and it's roughly 1.5% of my portfolio (and will likely become close to 2%). I've been slowly buying in since January of this year.\n\nA similar company to AMR is ARCH, which is also met coal + thermal coal, or CEIX. (BTU is another company I'm excited about but it's a much riskier play than AMR. I'm equally bullish on AMR/BTU and can say more if people want)"

After recent releases from the US Census Bureau, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Institute for Supply Management, the nowcasts of second-quarter real personal consumption expenditures growth and second-quarter real gross private domestic investment growth increased from 1.3 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively, to 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, while the nowcast of the contribution of the change in real net exports to second-quarter real GDP growth decreased from 0.38 percentage points to 0.31 percentage points.\n\nIt's true jobs got revised down in the earlier parts of the quarter. I'm not sure how much that matters for forward-looking stocks. Market is not going to care if Q1 gets revised down to 0.5% growth or something, and Q2 comes in strong. In any case, even if jobs growth slowed down in February/March, the unemployment rate *decreased* and wages came in hot, so it didn't appear to have much of an impact.\n\n----\n\nIrrelevant portfolio comments: Nice strong day. Coal names benefited from the rising market, with AMR rising nearly 6% and wiping out my losses. Very excited for Monday's earnings. If I had to pick the stock I was most bullish on in my entire portfolio right now (at current prices), it would be AMR.\n\nBTU + 3.6%, FCX (copper) +3.6%.

     "u/AP9384629344432 Thanks for sharing the great [bloomberg article about the massive $42B increase in bank loans in the latest weekly data.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/us-bank-lending-increased-for-a-fourth-straight-week?srnd=markets-vp&leadSource=uverify%20wall)\n\nLargest increase since December, just wow. \n\nDriven a ton by small banks ~$31B!!!  I feel like this completely debunks the whole credit crunch by regional and small banks thesis.\n\nEven if deposits went down I wouldn't actually be worried as long as credit was flowing heartily like it is.  We expect that deposits might shrink and that just means bank profits shrink a bit due to more expensive funding costs like brokered CDs.  But even then, excluding foreign institutions deposits, US actually went up \ud83d\ude02!\n\nI actually have had many long back and forth arguments with CRE doomers about office loans.  While class D properties have really taken a hit in values, many banks actually have pretty conservative LTVs and can absorb losses.  Moreover, it doesn't matter as long as banks are willing to renew loans or borrowers can refi elsewhere...  \"It isn't a loss until you sell\" actually applies to debt too.  It isn't a default as long as coverage ratios look healthy and the debt can be serviced (even with reduced occupancy), with loans extended or renewed.  Vacancies are slowly improving and eventually they will catch up."

Its in my ROTH so no taxes and I'm up 68% right now from a little over a year I think or maybe 1.5 years.\\n\\nAnyways how much upside is really left in AAPL short term? Maybe $200 if we're REALLY lucky.  And then it won't stay there all year!\\n\\nSo I've decided to sell all my shares and buy them back after we correct another 25 to 50% after fed hits the brakes on balance sheet.\\n\\nSomeone said once FED starts reducing balance sheet we're gonna fall maybe 25 to 50%.  Some people are saying the sp500 will go down maybe 90% ..... Dan Niles I think said it.\\n\\nToday Dan said that we should be 100% cash. I'm 30% cash and hopefully can get to maybe 50% or a little more for the Fed correction.\\n\\nAnyways I like AAPL long term but if its gonna go to $100 or lower .... Someone online said AAPL may hit $50 a share this summer.... Then id rather cash out tax free now and buy back in for more shares at $100 or even $50 if I'm really lucky!\\n\\nHow's my plan?

But you have to ask yourself why are you selling and what are you going to do with that money and what is your plan if Apple stock does not decline as you are planning?\n\nIf you have a plan B...such as Dollar Cost Averaging that money into a fund or ETF like $SCHD when stocks start to fall after this earnings season if Apple doesn't fall as you are planning  than I would say sell.  Plan A is buy Apple back cheaper.  Plan B if your wrong is DCA into $SCHD or whatever index fund.\n\nNo one knows what will happen.

That would be a waste of money and believe me or not - a bit more than a year ago, in the middle of pandemic, stock crash felt way more imminent than now during the recovery.\n\nPlus _cash_? During 5-10% inflation? Madness, imo.\n\nWhat exactly is your plan for this 50% allocation? If you really just want to play timing the market and load up on cheap stocks after correction - use margin, once the market crashes down load up on margin and deleverage during the recovery. Of course strategy works if and only if you expect you can time the market (_both_ end of growth, _and_ bottom of correction), but you seem to think you do, so margin should be safe, no?"

     "This is what happened to me. I started working when I was 16 and opened up an etrade account the day I turned 18 and bought $10,000 work of Amazon, I basically put my entire life savings in it...this was 2012 when they were priced around $300 a share. Fastforward to 2017 after continuing to buy more Amazon and basically nothing else...I was 22 years old with about $210,000 in amazon stock. At this point I wanted the money because I was thinking about a house and I just didn't feel comfortable with that amount of $ on one stock. I kept the amount of $ I had a secret from everybody until I finally told my parents asking them for advice. My dad is a business owner but doesn't have mch experience in stocks but he was basically like \"what the fuck...\" when I told him. He sent me to his financial planner and they helped me slowly sell some of the shares so it didn't overwhelm my tax liability. I still own some amazon shares to this day but I felt good about selling some of it and diversifying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat i'm trying to tell you is look into the future about what you need money for and base your decisions off of that. Do you feel comfortable having $210k in apple stock when you ant to buy a house soon?"

     "From mid September 2012 to February 2016 the S&P returned 40%+ while apple returned 5%.  We could absolutely see that again over a 4 year period.\n\nApples average PE over the past 20 years is under 20.  Currently its at 37.  This might make sense if they had 10%+ growth year over year but its revenue growth has been much lower than AMZN/GOOGL/MSFT/etc.  If we see it return to its average PE we could see a drop of \\~40%.  Now do I think that happens?  Probably not, but 20/30% is definitely reasonable if we see any bad news.\n\nApple is a fantastic company worth owning, but its gotten way ahead of itself IMO.  I think its very realistic to predict it could underperform the S&P over the next 5 years.  Its much harder to predict another 5 or 10 years of 10%+ growth per year unless they have a new revolutionary product.  I would absolutely diversify, if youre completely sold on tech there are plenty of other better companies to buy, and you can still keep a considerable chunk in Apple.  One thing you could consider is selling covered calls on Apple with a January 15 expiration to delay gains until 2021 while also having some protection on the downside.\n\nEdit: 2012 not 1012"

     "Wow... interesting thread with such an odd mix of advice - some good, some just outright bad. \n\nI\u2019ve put a fair amount of thought into this as I have an ongoing similar problem.\n\n1) - YES - diversify!  You\u2019ve been fortunate, you\u2019ve done well, but holding only one stock puts you in a risky position. \n\n2) - when you sell some of the apple, you\u2019ll be making a wise lateral move into another position or 3. You will still be in a position for great ongoing gains - there are many good investments to choose from. You are not stopping capital appreciation, you\u2019ll simply derive it from other sources. \n\n3) - Presuming you don\u2019t hold these shares in a tax deferred account (IRA, 401k), You will pay a taxes. \nThis is the bummer, as it takes the wind out of your sail and reduces your compounding gains. This is what you need to review and plan for. (If you are in a tax deferred account, you\u2019d be in great shape and can sell all you want this year). \n\nMake a plan. My completely blind plan for someone in your situation, presuming you\u2019re in a taxable account, is to reduce this holding to 20-30% of your portfolio over 3-4 years. I\u2019d encourage you to sell 1/4 of your position shares this tax year, and another similar percentage next year, adjusting as you need to based on the gain or loss in the APPL position. \n\nYou can use covered call options to do this and to generate additional income. That\u2019s a whole other thread, but well worth learning about. \n\n\nLast obvious point:  talk to experts and don\u2019t rely on reddit beyond getting a broad range of opinions. Consider a good advisor. Some of the trading firms can be very very helpful with basic advice and review without signing up for a managed account (plug for Schwab - their customer service has been great IMHO). Also, talk to tax advisors so you\u2019ll know your tax liability and adjust your plan as needed."

Almost every teenager I know has an iPhone and they would never leave for an Android devie.\n\n2) Strong products - Apple has a reputation of their products being reliable and long lasting\n\n3) Conspicuous consumption.  Apple products carry a premium price tag and people love to flaunt their consumption. Hence I think another reason they are so popular with teens\n\n4) Accessories.  Airpods are insanely popular.  Watches too. Apple keeps making hardware that people love and that sell like crazy.\n\n5) Services - not only the app store but banking as well...Apple has their hands in so much\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHold your Apple shares. It's going to be $200 a share by next fall excluding any major bad events or news. \n\nI think you are fine if you want to start buying some other things to diversify, but don't dump Apple."

     "\nPeople diversify their personal portfolios because they can\u2019t afford to lose their entire retirement account due to one stock going belly up. Most people also don\u2019t even manage their own investments, so a financial advisor is making safe investments (to save his ass and yours) for the long term. So basically, you\u2019re looking at 3-7% yearly growth. \n\nNow if you analyze stocks and know a lot about a specific company, there should be no issue putting everything into 1 stock. The reason you own $213k of Apple shouldn\u2019t be merely because it\u2019s a seemingly strong company, but because you see it as a forever stock. Make sure you keep up with earnings, what the true value of the company is, and sales/business statistics. Research whether Apple is a long term viable option in the tech industry and evaluate its possible shortcomings. \n\nMy suggestion is to keep this Apple growth account, as it will probably make you a millionaire one day; however, get a Roth or 401k and invest those in some safer options (ETFs)."

Further, spread the money around in a few different industries if you are buying individual equities.  Tech is a big driver but it is still cyclical.  There were years not so long ago where tech was treading water or growing slowly."

If you\u2019re confident in your abilities to select winning stocks, don\u2019t worry about how many stocks you own. Personally, I think AAPL is very overvalued at current prices, and it has lots of near-term downside. It is, however, one of if not the best company in the world, and long-term downside is as close to non-existent as you can get. If you plan on holding your portfolio for more than five years, Apple can create a lot of wealth for you. If you do want to diversify, I\u2019d recommend purchasing some shares in Berkshire Hathaway. This would maintain a decent level of exposure to Apple (Berkshire\u2019s largest holding is Apple) while also giving you indirect exposure to some of America\u2019s other great companies (Amazon, Visa, Costco, you name it).\n\nThe short answer: maybe."

Assuming nothing bad happens to Apple, you're just magnifying your gains and losses compared to the QQQ etf that's tech heavy. The benefit of the QQQ is that if Apple happens to crash, QQQ won't crash as much and will still have other stocks to make up for the loss.\n\nLike everyone knows, the only way to increase return is to increase your risk, and you're clearly doing that. You just gotta be aware of the risks you are taking.\n\nAnother note is you need a plan for when to cash out, if at all (like not cashing it all out during retirement age to keep it for your kin). Especially in retirement age, you'll want to decrease your investments in stock in general (or invest in safer stocks at minimum) when you're starting to take from the portfolio/your investments to live off of, because if there's a recession, you'll still need to withdrawal from your portfolio to live...\n\nEdit: Now would be a good time to cash out and buy the dip later...

Future earnings are becoming worthless if not massively able to negate assumed levels of inflation, cost of financing, labor, inventory, etc. Their earnings were bad...but they lost 1/4 of value over 1Q of bad earnings.\n\nThey were also like major factor in todays drop. Retail is down, not horrible, but relative to shit not even adjusted with current inflation, let alone future, and markets were looking to them as a key guage (and wal mart too) in what to expect this yr. But marginal demand from consumers as we start to watch our paychecks shrink, profits become worth less, expenses cost more, etc...eh.\n\nApple @ 60ish doesn't sound insane if next yr they can only sell half their phones, which cost 25% more to produce (exaggeration...just saying tho)"

     "Commodities part 3:\nFood related commodities.\n\nHere is a list of food commodities that have peaked during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The % shows how much it dropped since. (A non negligible portion of those also peaked during or after the Pandemic).\n\nWheat  -50%\nPalm Oil  -55%\nCanola  -40%\nSunflower  -60%\nRapeseed  -62%\nButter  -35%\nCorn  -22%\nLean Hogs  -35%\nBeef  -18%\n\nAll right, so, to be honest it was hard to find correlations for the food commodities, they are all over the place, but here are the ones that shown a significant increase after they bottomed in the beginning of the pandemic. The % shows the increase since then.\n\nOrange Juice  +200%\nRice  +50%\nSugar  +200%\nPotatoes  +1500%\nFeeder Cattle  +95%\nLive Cattle  +100%\nSalmon  +135%\n\nOk two things I wanna point out here, 1st is that, unfortunately, food got more expensive since the beginning of the pandemic and it doesn't seem to be improving which is not what I was expecting.\n\nAlso wtf is going on with potatoes prices! I use trading economics for this whole series of comments and ... [see for yourself](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/potatoes)\n. Since it was a bit to hard to believe I went and checked on some other sources [like this one from FRED.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPU01130603) who tells a whole different story but still talks about higher prices. Enough about potato prices.\n\nHere is a list of the other food commodities that I was getting tired of trying to fit into patterns because I was starting to lack imagination and I just want to move on with my life. I added some notes with each of them.\n\nMilk: Bottomed in March 2020. seesawed up and down violently and is now in it's average historical price trending down.\n\nCheese: Moves in tandem with milk\n\nCoffee: Traded rather low for 2 years until March 2021 where it dramatically increased, it has been seesawing downward slowly since, still quite elevated.\n\nOat: Rather low for 6 years until Nov 2020 where prices got outta control and reach it's\npeak a year later, now back down to it's lows.\n\nTea: Seesawing up and down but nothing really worth noting here.\n\nPoultry: Constant progressive increase since March 2018, it's declining but still twice higher than 2018.\n\nEggs US: Nothing special here until March 2022 where it started to take off 4x to reach it's peak in end of 2022 it has fallen sharply since almost back to trend.\n\nAll right, that sums it up. I recommend when doing a fundamental analysis of a company that you always consider what commodities\nthey benefit/depend on. \n\nAlso, I'm disappointed to notice that food\ncommodity prices are still rather elevated compared to metals and energy which have both dropped significantly since the post pandemic and Russian invasion.\n\nLast note, it seems Trading Economics track future contracts prices so it may not exactly be in direct correlation with the increase/decrease with the food you buy at the grocery store."

So the Chinese reopening has been a bit muted, but what the commodity experts/analysts have been saying is that while Chinese industrial/manufacturing activity has been muted, Chinese consumer activity is booming.

Buffett is the largest holder of AAPL outside passive investing.  If AAPL tanked 50% tomorrow, HE WILL NOT DUMP.  If it moons 50% in one day he also WILL NOT DUMP.  Despite being the largest holder, he has zero impact on its price.  He will also never short companies.  So in the long-run people like him buy when it reaches absurdly low levels.

Cook just disclosed 40% growth in iPads and that means every other sector of hardware is growing as never before as well.  Services may take a hit from the epic lawsuit (not right away but eventually)  but Apple has plenty of time to make up for any slowness there by growing other sectors, like advertising which it has never really exploited, but if they take a hit on video games, they can make up for it with ads.  And btw these will be ethical ads, that is no datamining.  I still see $200 within a year and SWKS is also a buy, a key Apple supplier which for no good reason is a bit beaten down.  Instreaming media, VIAC is a steal, T a bargain buy and Apple may make a  big move with an aquisition, though that would be first for them. They usually only buy small strategic companies but if they want 100+ million of streaming subs they need to buy a chunk of Hollywood and VIAC is the obvious target."

I've been moaning about large cap valuations for a few months now, but even I don't think large cap valuations are so excessively high that you would only expect to see a 1.7% return over a decade assuming interest rates remain relatively stable. Most experts can barely predict what's going to happen in the economy 6 months out, let alone 10 years. Any predictions more than 2 years out should be ignored completely.\n\nA lot of analysts are seeing opportunities in small caps relative to large caps at the moment so my guess is that some are painting an excessively negative picture of large cap returns to scare investors into following them into small caps. What I would say is that flat year for a stock like AAPL is absolutely possible at this point, even two flat years wouldn't be unthinkable given its valuation, but flat for a decade? I very much doubt it..."

Then there is AR/VR, cloud, more people buying and using mobile computers. Bottom line is we are spending more time using a screen and becoming more dependent on these companies.

New services, new hardware coming (AirTags, AR, car??) and the selling stays unrelenting. For a growth stock they pay a nice dividend too. \\n\\nIll admit today I bought a bunch of June 18 $125 calls. Already down like 3k on them, which sucks. I just dont see how we cant get a small bounce back to $120s in the near future. What do you guys think?'",

     "The hard and honest truth - you gambled on AAPL getting a bump today, probably off of the stimulus news, and now you're learning how quickly options let you light money on fire when the market moves against you. I think that you'll be lucky if your calls break even, and if you do make money it's likely going to gut you over the next few months in the process. To me, today proved that the market is drunk on stimulus and that more money is going to do little to support it the prices we see, even now. I could be wrong, it could turn around, but I'm not counting on it. Sounds like you learned a $3k dollar lesson, either learn from it or double down and make it $6k/$9k/$12k (judging by your position I'm guessing $12k was your investment or thereabouts). \n\nIf you believe in AAPL long term, roll your calls out into LEAPS or close out the option position and buy shares and then forget about it for a while or average down if you have more to spend (and want to). Or close the position, wait until you're comfortable getting back in, and come back wiser."

Still feels very pricey at $116 from that perspective, especially in an environment where we know interest rates will eventually go up.\n\n2) The 200 day moving average is at $114. That should be near term support. But if it breaks that... look out below. I don't see the next support until at least $100 and then $90 to $70 beyond that."

Then when it hit 1T mkt cap, people told me I should sell, so I bought more. At nearly 2.5T and a declining 1M chart, everyone told me to start selling my shares, so I bought more. \n\nAAPL is not only still a growth stock, but a growth stock that invests more in both R&D and investor returns (i.e., divvies) than basically any company in the entire US. And because they care about investor returns, they'll simply engage in share buybacks if the stock price starts moving too far away from where they want. \n\nMoral of the story, always buy AAPL, but don't expect short-term results. Long-term play, so go buy some Jan calls at like $140 strike. Bet those will be cheap tomorrow if there's a moderate pull back after today's big move in tech stocks."

     "The way this is calculated by the way is taking the premium attached to at the money call and put options at the ask for the expiration next Friday. This is then added to the current stock price and then subtracted to come up with the weekly risk range. Generally if we fall out of this range you can consider us to be oversold or overbought. If we hit the upper or lower risk ranges at the start of the week it could set up nicely for a good risk to reward trade for the opposite direction. When important macro news occurs like Fridays poor Cpi print, you can see big deviations away from these ranges."

     "I know people dont like to hear it, but you need some contrarian opinions instead of just hype.\n\nI dont believe in AMD.  I owned it from 7$ to 100$, but its way too overpriced now.  Its trading too close to Intel, during a chip shortage when Intel is getting many tens in billions in subsidies for its fabs, they're releasing a GPU, and its moving to a chiplet architecture more similar to AMD; which will be released before the chip shortage ends and before AMD fully capitalizes on their short lived advantage.\n\nWhen the fabs are operational then you have AMD with a lower margin product who buys chips from a country we arent unsure wont be taken over by China.  National security is taking stage, and that affects OEM's like Dell and HP as well.\n\nAlso the investment into Xilinx makes no sense, they face a 1/3rd stock dilution to buy something overpriced that they have no means of making more profitable.  What is AMD going to do to aid them, give them TSMC's phone number?  AMD makes its money because they own the right to use x86, thats always been their only ace.  Even with that they made stupid decisions, like releasing Bulldozer while Ryzen was being produced, to seemingly make a tiny amount of money and tarnish their own brand.  For some reason the rollout of Ryzen and their GPU's were extremely slow as well, I still have no idea why they were so conservative.  They stand on the shoulders of giants, they arent a giant themselves."

  "Text": "b\"Looking at MVIS, there has been alot of internet hype about the stock. It's tough to nail down exactly why it is rallying, but I suspect its purely due to short squeeze mechanics. The shares available on iborrowdesk have shrunk to as little as 59 shares available and the fee has jumped to 59%. Considering how heavily shorted this is and how short sellers have learned how to better control these situations after GME and other meme stock run ups, the smart money is saying its going back to where it came from. \\n\\nI can remember playing BBBY back in August and similar mechanics were at play. MVIS has run up from about 1.82 low to now to a high of 7.27 or almost a 4 fold run up. BBBY ran from about 5 bucks to  30 for a 6 fold run up which really only stopped because Cohen sold his stake. So there may be more gas in the tank. \\n\\nMVIS also had a similar run from about $1.80 to $7 back in 2020 leading into 2021. From there it was able to achieve a price of 24 and several months later 28. However\"",

     "This is a curious post, and even more interesting comments!\n\nI\u2019m commenting here, because I genuinely want to find out what exactly you folks base the bearish attitude on. \n\nFirst let me say that I am well aware of the fact that this current run is completely unsustainable. It\u2019s a short squeeze, plain and simple. The stock is highly shorted and it was only a matter of time until something like this was going to happen. \n\nHowever, that\u2019s not why I invested. Someone here mentioned that this company seems to have a die-hard following of \u201capes\u201d since 2017. That is only partially true.\n\nYes, there is a number of people who have been following the company very closely since 2017 (some even way before that). However, these are not the \u201capes\u201d. They (and myself) aren\u2019t invested in Microvision for a short squeeze. A squeeze is nice, but in the end I don\u2019t care that much about it, other than the fact that it\u2019s nice to see my portfolio increase in value at incredible rates. I\u2019m aware that it will go down again. \n\nNo, the reason some people have been invested since 2017 was that with the new leadership, the company took deliberate steps to create a product that it anticipated would be in high demand in the future. They focussed almost all resources on that product and began working carefully towards a set goal. In the end, they came up with a solution that, at least on paper, is better than the alternatives of the competition. \n\nEver since I bought in, the leadership announced goals and went on to either meet those targets or even beat them. They have a lower cash burn than the competition, while having more cash on hand. They have received feedback from potential future partners and customers that their product was by far the best of the bunch, and they anticipate high-volume deals and wins this year. \n\nThis year is make or break. Either they deliver or they don\u2019t. If they don\u2019t, I have to rethink that investment. However, so far they delivered on all their promises. I believe they will deliver on that one as well. The goal is to create a situation similarly to what exists with airbags. There is only a handful of companies in the world that make airbags. It\u2019s a quiet market segment, but these companies completely dominate an industry that is essential to us. Microvision wants to achieve the same with LIDAR and ADAS. \n\nIt took and still takes a long breath and a lot of patience, but I think it\u2019ll pay off in the future.\n\nNow, there are a lot of proper \u201capes\u201d around. They see a stock that\u2019s currently squeezing hard, and we have a lot of people pouring into r/Mvis from r/wallstreetbets, but the people who have been there longer, and who have actually done due diligence on the company are not in it for a squeeze. \n\nMVIS has nothing in common with BBBY, GME or AMC. It actually has a product it sees demand for, and a plan mapped out for its future. \n\nSo I\u2019m genuinely asking: what makes you folks think this is a shit investment? I don\u2019t mean this as clapping back. I\u2019m genuinely asking for a detailed response, because I\u2019m genuinely curious. \n\nI understand being bearish in the short term, and I understand being at least cautious in the mid- to long-run. As some here have pointed out: it\u2019s a very competitive field and there\u2019s no way of knowing who\u2019ll win. \n\nAll I can base my guess on is the fact that Microvision have made smart moves, produced a more cost-efficient and all around superior product, and have so far delivered on everything they have promised. \n\nSo\u2026yeah, I\u2019m genuinely curious and in no way hostile or judgemental: what is your basis for a bearish attitude?"

They need to continue to optimize efficiency with thier core products and services. \n\nThe need to realize the cash they have sitting around is being de-valuated at a very rapid pace and there is risk of higher interest rates going forward, so maybe it will be wise to chip away at the debt.\n\nI think they will continue the course with the buybacks and they will chip away at the debt a little faster. I dont think the stock price will move much in the next year but I wouldnt be surprised to see a 10-15% bump given relative \"safety\" and fPE assuming it is realized. At the same time, I do think that tech is in a bubble due to speculative stocks and though Apple isnt one of them, if the sector goes down, everything goes with it. Apple will weather the storm better but if it finally deflates then it might hurt the short term valuation."

Apple was supposed to be all about privacy akd security; will people think twice now about either 1) sending their iPhones into apple repair chains 2) switching to android? Apple is being sued by Epic Games for anticompetitive practices in their app store. Should they lose then their future revenue growth is threatened.\n\nThere are threats to this company.

This shows the confidence some of the big money have in the overall sector. Note that FRC isn't on the list, and some fund owners who had positions have actually sold (Ensemble) or did not add because of uncertainty (Wedgewood, read their quarterly letter, it's great overview of the sector/timeline). Given the importance of regional banks on the health of the US economy in commercial and residential mortgage lending, I don't think it's likely that there will be such onerous regulations that it will have long term detrimental effects on the sector, maybe some token legislation targeted at the specific problems at SVB, if at all."

     "[Interesting point on the oil markets.](https://twitter.com/ALikhodedov/status/1663223453430824976) About 2 years ago in May of 2021, Citi Bank's notably bearish Ed Morse put out estimates of US production at different oil prices. [Here is the graph](https://i.imgur.com/F5OhE8T.png). May 2021 to year end saw oil average $72; 2022 saw oil average $95; 2023 YTD is $75. Note that these levels of WTI aren't even *on* the chart.\n\nLet's assume 2023 ends at averaging $70 a barrel (despite $75 YTD). We should be producing about 15.5M barrels a day based on that prediction. Where are we actually at? \n\n....\n\n12.5 mbd. [Here is US production basically flattening out](https://i.imgur.com/qttz0Ov.png). And we are now seeing rig cuts as my comments the past few days have indicated--this doesn't hit production immediately, but rather future production. It's the completion of DUC wells that directly impacts production. Yes, production increased after an insane 2022. Do you think after H1's horrid crude oil price action oil companies are jumping to drill? With interest rates at 5%?\n\nOkay, so Currie et al. at Goldman Sachs got the oil price rally totally wrong. Here is a [timeline of his failed calls](https://i.imgur.com/ihMkzE7.png). Ed Morse's price predictions have been mostly spot on--he's calling for $76 by year end. But Morse's supply call is way off--US production is not going to save the day. If $75, $95 is not enough to get production beyond 12.5 mbd, what will it take to go hit say 15 mbd? Currie will win the longer term supply argument, in my view, and ultimately prices."

     "I think today Apple is somewhat to expensive, I wouldn\u2019t buy simply because I do think the market will go through a big change. Not only Apple but all tech companies will see a big shake once the shortage of semiconductors levels put in a year, maybe 2. With Intel and TSMC(this one been the main supplier for apple chips) announcement of 30-40B on fab space in Arizona for 5nm fabs and government pushing for trillions in development, I think we will hit a point where supply is greater than demand in like 4-5 years which will make US supply chain more independent in this field but will also hit the market in terms of having too much capacity that we don\u2019t really need. This will be pivotal, the supply will sure become more useful in the future but short term it might affect us in a negative way. I think this will hit all big tech companies, Apple included, but Apple also has the advantage of moving to ARM earlier than any other company of its size and having already amazing integration. I think this will make them recover faster companies others, they simply will have already adapted to where the market wants to go, since IMO ARM is the future of computer architecture. \nTLDR: 2 years for supply to level, 4-5 for us to see too much supply and not enough demand, and then recovery. I already own Apple shares, I wouldn\u2019t buy today unless I\u2019m think in short term, but I would buy in the future after this transition periods.\nPS. I\u2019m not a financial advisor, I\u2019m a EE & Materials Science person, My comment is based on my industry experience, education, trends, and what I personally believe is the future pf semiconductors and technology market. All times are subject to change :)"

They do not appraise the intrinsic value of the stocks before buying or selling them, but rather follow their whims and biases. They will twist or disregard any factor to make the stocks appear cheap or expensive, such as using a higher or lower interest rate, projecting a faster or slower growth rate, or anything else that justifies their wish to buy or sell the stock. That's the face of fundamental analysis in retail domain.\n\nThe main lesson is: spread your portfolio among 20 to 30 stocks and avoid extreme actions"

  "Text": "b\"I just went through their latest Form 10-Q. Their current ratio is 1.038, which is barely passable in my book. For a company famous for having a huge pile of cash, their cash ratio is 0.252. While they have a solid profit margin (28%), their PE ratio calculated off of current price / quarterly EPS on 10Q is 83.2, which is insane to me. Idk, what do you guys think?\\n\\nEdit: their D/A ratio is 81 percent!!! What happened??\\n\\nEdit 2: Thanks to u/ticktock1001 for correcting me. It's price over ANNUAL EPS, I was using quarterly EPS, which would make the calculation 4x what it should be.\"",

     "It's called asset allocation.\n\nInstead of having cash sit idle, Apple created more shareholder value.\n\n\\#1, the cash was used to purchase marketable securities which as they matured past one year, are no longer considered 'short-term marketable securities.' Apple bought U.S. treasury bonds with them. They also invest in other treasuries across the world. It's not like the cash suddenly disappeared. They're just being used to generate a higher return through other investment vehicles.\n\n\\#2, they increased dividends. Last year, they paid out nearly $15 billion in dividends to investors.\n\n\\#3, last year, Apple spent nearly $90 billion in stock buybacks. The past decade, they spent nearly $500 billion. That's where their money is going to. Buying outstanding shares, creating more shareholder value, and making use of their cash. Their profits are locked up in other countries to avoid corporate taxes. It makes sense from this perspective.\n\n\\#4, Apple gets low interest debt from banks. Lower than the U.S. treasury rate. It's like if you had $1,000 and you can either put it in U.S. treasury for a 5% yield and then borrow the $1,000 from a bank for an interest rate of 3%. Why wouldn't you borrow and then deduct interest expense? That's why Apple's current liabilities have gone up (which will affect their current ratio). They have been borrowing money and using their cash stack for buybacks and marketable securities.\n\nThe thing about ratios is they are formula-based. You need to figure out where the money went and this is why you compare their overall balance sheet and also check their 8-K and other additional info disclosed."

My other reason is because large cap stocks have been seeing a pump recently- Tesla Nvidia now apple have all done the same which is strange cause they all pumped directly after the other starting falling from highs. Their earnings have actually been getting worse each quarter as well which is opposite of what you would think from price action. I believe it will dip back to the $120-$130 range next"

Plus average price of Android smartphones started going up. Fall of OnePlus and premium image of apple has allowed it to become most popular expensive phone and do record sales here.

     "Not a shareholder, but i agree with others that i don't think buying Netflix would make sense for Apple. Why:\n\n* Netflix has a huge user base. But Apple already got this thorugh their ecosystem, similar to Amazon through Prime. So that is something they don't need to pay for. And imo part of Apples success is also the lock in effect and synergies they have through said ecosystem. But i really don't see the average Netflix subscriber convert to Apple hardware just because they bought it.\n\n* Content. Existing IP with the potential to expand on it as well as building a base to keep people hooked is what Apple lacks. But so does Netflix, at least relatively speaking compared to many other streaming services. Since everybody is doing their own streaming service now and pulling their content, Netflix has to spend a lot on creating new shows and movies. Also where as Apple seems to go for quality over quantity (in line with their brand), Netflix pretty much does the opposite. Sub par content imo could even hurt Apple more than help.\n\n* Netflix even after the drop is a large company. I don't think Apple really does those kind of take overs, they usually just do their own thing or if anything go for smaller companies.\n\nSo basically Netflix imo is the opposite of what Apple wants. I am not sure if they even want to buy something right now or are fine with the slow and steady growth. But if they do, then they'd want something like Amazon buying MGM. Smallish and with memorable IP like James Bond."

     "Good evening /r/stocks. Today I would like to provide some data points and headlines about the oil market. Skip to the end for the TL;DR on why you should ignore ALL Of this and sell:\n\n## US Shale\n\n- [Bloomberg:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-19/oil-drilling-plunges-the-most-in-two-years-as-shale-producers-retreat?srnd=markets-vp) \"Oil drilling is collapsing in the US as producers rein in output, mirroring a recent plunge in rigs searching for natural gas. Rigs targeting crude declined by 11 to 575 this week, according to data released Friday by Baker Hughes Co. It\u2019s the biggest weekly drop since September 2021. The pullback was led by the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most prolific US shale play, where four rigs were dropped.\" [Visual](https://i.imgur.com/RgS9xH4.png).\n- Key driver of US production seeing productivity fall: \"Lea + Eddy county, responsible for 50% of Permian's production increase over the last 2 years, look to be suffering from an almost comedic well productivity degradation!\" [Source](https://twitter.com/WhiteTundraSG/status/1659333130569015297).\n\n## OPEC\n\n- [Visual: OPEC exports falling](https://i.imgur.com/GVLjdaJ.png)\n- Saudi Arabia needs higher prices: \"The International Monetary Fund expects Saudi Arabia won\u2019t balance its budget if oil is below $80 a barrel, a revision that means the kingdom will move back into fiscal deficit after its first surplus in almost a decade.\" This is 'up by more than a fifth from what it had forecast in October.' Here's a [table of break-even prices by OPEC country](https://i.imgur.com/AammJke.png). \"The assessment aligns with the view of Bloomberg Economics, which estimates Saudi Arabia needs an oil price above $80 and perhaps closer to $100 to meet all spending commitments and ensure the stability of the social contract between the government and the citizens.\" [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/saudi-arabia-needs-pricier-oil-to-balance-its-budget-imf-says).\n- From [Tweet](https://twitter.com/WhiteTundraSG/status/1656016484513255429), here is a visual of [cargo loaded from OPEC+ ex-Russia](https://i.imgur.com/QJuLV7T.png), and you can see recent declining numbers. Why is this important? As [another thread](https://twitter.com/econ_713/status/1657883709238829057) from a different author points out, \"The physical oil mkt is slow-moving. A tanker loaded in KSA [Saudi Arabia] will take ~44 days to reach the Houston Ship Channel. Thus, cuts that \u2018start\u2019 on May 1st will not impact data until mid-June. This leads inexperienced pundits to prematurely pronounce that the cuts \u2018aren\u2019t working\u2019 or won\u2019t matter. These are amateur takes, & the key data to be watching [right now] is *loadings.* And these data confirm that the cuts are real & will print mid-June. \"\n- A long [comment from October 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8thxi/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/it3rjpm/) on OPEC spare capacity.\n\n## Financial Markets and Sentiment\n\n- Visual from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-20/hedge-funds-ultra-bearish-oil-bets-signal-us-recession-angst?srnd=markets-vp): Paper markets [extremely bearish](https://i.imgur.com/cXgJBvC.png). Why does this matter? If prices start to rise, \"any large gains in oil prices could unleash as much as $40 billion worth of buying in US crude and Brent alone from trend-following commodity trading advisers\" and shorts turn long.\n- [Visual from Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/energy-oil-gas-stock-picks-roundtable-f0171204?mod=hp_HERO): Energy sector with [historically small](https://i.imgur.com/zyVDTYh.png) share of S&P 500. \n\n## Global Demand\n\n- [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-20/hedge-funds-ultra-bearish-oil-bets-signal-us-recession-angst?srnd=markets-vp) on refining demand + inventories: \"Refineries are processing the most crude for this time of year since the pandemic began. Air travel is rising just about everywhere, and gasoline demand in the US is now at the highest level since December 2021. At the same time, fuel inventories are below seasonal norms for gasoline and diesel in the US, and OPEC+ cuts and Canadian wildfires have limited crude supply.\" \n- IEA raising forecasts via [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/iea-says-oil-price-downturn-ignores-looming-supply-crunch-2023-05-16/): \"Prices were pressured lower by muted industrial activity and higher interest rates, which, combined have led to recessionary scenarios gaining traction,\" the Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil report. \"The current market pessimism, however, stands in stark contrast to the tighter market balances we anticipate in the second half of the year, when demand is expected to eclipse supply by almost 2 million barrels per day (bpd).\" The IEA raised its forecast for global oil demand by 200,000 bpd to 102 million bpd, noting that China's recovery after the lifting of COVID-19 curbs had surpassed expectations with demand reaching a record 16 million bpd in March.\" By the way they hold this view *despite* also thinking diesel demand contracts. \n- [Visual of IEA's supply/demand forecast](https://i.imgur.com/8ti8IIg.png). Sharp tightening of markets anticipated in H2 2023. Here is a more [recent update](https://i.imgur.com/h3BWVSi.png) that shows entering supply deficit in this very quarter!\n- Visuals: [International commercial flights](https://i.imgur.com/cqZEe4S.png) and [US air travel](https://i.imgur.com/witexEj.png) from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WhiteTundraSG/status/1659747215974481920)\n- [Chinese crude imports](https://i.imgur.com/layZBdp.png) from [Tweet](https://twitter.com/WhiteTundraSG/status/1656016492251742209)\n\n## My Past Claims and Data w/ Reading Recommendations\n\n- By the way, I'm not a oil permabull. Here is [me in September 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x762ow/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_sep/ind1cfn/) warning that the gloom over European natural gas was extremely overdone. Indeed, prices have [tanked](https://www.ft.com/content/ba8f7a30-954b-4620-b8f1-40de771e77fb), with \"European natural gas prices fell back into their normal trading range for the first time since the start of the energy crisis on Thursday, falling below \u20ac30 per megawatt hour to reach the lowest level since June 2021. The price of benchmark TTF fell as low as \u20ac29.75/mwh, down more than 8 per cent on the day, to levels last seen before Russia started squeezing Europe\u2019s pipeline gas supplies ahead of its invasion of Ukraine.\" Just [look at this chart](https://i.imgur.com/DsGSL4T.png) from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-18/europe-gas-futures-fall-below-30-for-first-time-since-june-2021#xj4y7vzkg).\n- Me in November pushing back against [imminent skyrocketing of energy prices](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ynb88z/winter_is_comingenergy/iv8ffwc/)\n- [Me in late December](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zwmp18/putin_bans_sale_of_russian_oil_to_the_west/j1wvci8/) arguing that the threat that Russia can sabotage oil markets and send them to new highs is gone.\n- [Me in July 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wa0lut/blackrock_energy_crisis_hits_europe_stay_away/ihydv8w/) arguing that European stocks are very cheap and (by extension) suggesting not to sell out of or avoid Europe. And this was when energy prices were through the roof. The Europe ETF $VGK is up 14% since then, the German $DAX and FTSE 100 would hit all time highs. Japan too, recently. \n- But I am generally bullish for the long term, as [argued in this October comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ygqxb1/5y_perspective_on_global_markets/iuapp8i/).\n- Am I positioned for this thesis? [You bet](https://i.imgur.com/eXM1HkW.png). \n- [A set of 20 bullet points](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wgqxn0/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_aug/ij3081u/) with various bull/bear cases for oil. In general I got wrong how much crude would fall, but the one claim I was consistently right on is that natural gas markets would tank. Both Henry Hub (US) and TTF (Europe). And tank they did.\n- My start of year predictions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zzwrcp/rstocks_2022_roundup_looking_ahead_at_2023/j2gvesp/) on the broader market. I say oil falls to low $70 and stays range bound $80-90, and no stratospheric jumps. We shall see if I get that part right. Check out all the wrong tech calls I made though.\n- Here I wrote about [declining shale productivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12aez60/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_apr_03_2023/jeu7g66/) and I also give some data upthread [on how the financial positions of producers have substantially improved](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/12aez60/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_apr_03_2023/jetukuu/).\n- Would you like a list of reading recommendations? [I made a compilation here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11gp31l/energy_sector_stocksetfs/japrjd3/).\n\n**TL;DR**: But I have bad news for my portfolio and the energy bulls. [This week's front cover of Barron's](https://i.imgur.com/FhX0um7.png). Sell sell sell!\n\n**P.S.:** If you actually took the time to read even >50% of this enormous comment, let me know by upvoting/downvoting/commenting or whatever so I feel *someone* got something out of it and I'll make more in the future."

     "I'd appreciate someone's input on the discrepancy in valuations reported by Morningstar with that of an ETF's fund documents. Consider [AVDV, an actively managed Avantis fund](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf/) that tracks small cap value companies outside of the US and in developed markets. It is extremely diversified within its segment, [with 1336 companies](https://i.imgur.com/bE0NH1A.png) and [none with more than 0.75% weight](https://i.imgur.com/Au4jmmc.png). The weighted average market cap is $1.7B--where by weighted they multiply each market cap by its weight in the ETF, not simply averaging the market caps. This is stated in [their definition](https://i.imgur.com/g4UPsTi.png). They go on to calculate similar weighted valuation metrics:\n\n- Weighted Average Book/Market 1.06x [i.e., B/P]\n- Weighted Average Profits/Book of 0.32x. [i.e. E/B]\n- An implied E/P ratio of (1.06)*(0.32) = 0.34\n- An implied **P/E ratio** of 1 / (0.34) = **2.94**\n- An implied **P/B ratio** of 1 / 1.06 = **0.94**.\n\nOn the other hand, [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/avdv/portfolio) states that the **P/E of AVDV was 7.16** and the **P/B is 0.84**. [Here are all their valuation metrics.](https://i.imgur.com/zpIuixB.png)\n\nWhy is Morningstar giving a P/E ratio that is 2.4x higher than the fund documents? Is this because Morningstar doesn't do any weighting and literally just averages the P/E of every company in the ETF no matter its weight? Does it have to do with the treatment of negative earnings companies? Simultaneously, Morningstar has a P/B ratio of 0.84 which is *lower* than the Avantis document's implied 0.94 ratio. So Morningstar has a more expensive P/E ratio but cheaper P/B ratio.\n\nBoth sources indicate this sector and ETF is extremely cheap, but I'm very interested in if it is as cheap as implied by Avantis."

Look at what happened to Tesla from 2020-2021 and how it destroyed shorts and was exuberantly priced, same thing can happen with Nvidia and it can stay higher for longer. Markets can stay irrational longer than individuals can stay solvent. If someone regularly DCA's from their paycheck they get to average in the lows and the highs and general 30+ year outlook is that USA should go up or we have bigger problems. And we are NOT Japan... Also there is a strong possibility that high beta growth stuff was expensive before but got overshot to the downside and is just finding a reasonable floor, we don't really know.  I'm long but hedge, and my hedge from SQQQ from 2 weeks ago is down over 20% and my covered calls are near the money.

What this means now is that they can still make an announcement via 8K in this upcoming week (apparently they need to get 13 signatures physically signed), but they cannot start the actual buybacks until the earnings report is released end of April. There is a blackout period that starts April 1st. \n\nSome were hoping they would both announce the resolution and initiate buybacks before today, but it looks like that will have to wait. Patience will be key here.\n\nIt looks like BTU had large buying right before close today, likely in anticipation of big moves coming up. Quarter end selling might have also impacted today's price action at least early on (BTU is not an ESG name funds want to have on their portfolio). There will be selling pressure from Elliott Management looking to exit their position, but shareholder returns will likely bring in plenty of new buyers, including BTU itself, to bring stock price up. \n\nI'm roughly equally bullish on AMR/BTU, with the risk of BTU not executing on the capital returns making up for AMR having less upside."

Given Apple recently hit $125 a share and is now at $115 ($116 after hours), it could represent a very good entry point to take advantage of this being introduced in 2021.\\n    \\n\\nhttps://www.coywolf.news/seo/apple-search-engine/'",

At best, Apple cracks something in AI that allows them to skip decades of user input but the biggest news out of that most likely wouldn't be a search engine (woot Skynet!).\n\nMy money is on services and health, especially if those can combine at a corporate level. Imagine in 10 years if Apple can get a true barebones Apple Watch that can be sterilized. Instead of a wrist tag for everyone who gets admitted into a hospital, they get a watch instead that monitors basic vitals and ties you to the hospitals network. Apple could make money on each unit sold and charge the hospital a subscription based service to manage them."

With safari holding a significant portion of the market, the amount of ad revenue and data tracking can be huge simply by changing the default.\n\nThis especially holds true for businesses. Many employees don't use Chrome as they don't want to sign in and have their employers know what they're browsing. So they end up using the stock browser, internet explorer or safari.

Got a factory in Tennessee that is starting cell production this year to fulfill a $330m order for a 1.2GWh BESS order. Also will qualify for the IRA stipend of $45k/kWh since we do both cells (35k) + packs (10k). We expect over $1.5-2 Billion long term from the IRA just with the one USA factory. Oh and the DOE gave us a $200m grant to build a separator factory in partnership with G fucking M (General Motors). To help them fulfill their performance and safety goals, especially in their Ultium line of cells (think premium). We also are the sole cell supplier for Iveco\u2019s new eDaily van\u2026 an electric version of Iveco\u2019s normal (gas powered) eDaily\u2026 the most popular ($$$) commercial van in all of Europe.

     "I've been investing since the 1980's.  You're correct that IPO's have changed.  There's much more private equity around, which is why companies go private much later in their growth cycle than they did 30 years ago.  That means finding the $1 billion IPO that will grow to $10 billion is almost impossible.\n\nHowever, companies looking extremely overpriced early in their growth cycle has always been a feature.  All the megacap companies appeared overpriced by any standard valuation metrics early in their public life.\n\nSo trying to forecast which companies will build the enduring sustainable advantage and take over an industry was just as hard then as now.\n\nFor example, why did Google dominate search instead of Yahoo?\n\nHow did Apple takeover smartphones instead of Nokia or BlackBerry?\n\nAnd Amazon?  Who would have predicted they'd take over online marketplace and cloud computing?\n\nThere were lots of IPOs and startups in the 1980s and 1990s and most I remember that were hot for a while have either been acquired, failed, or gone nowhere.\n\nIdentification of future megacap winners was just as hard then as now."

To name just a couple examples: Uber IPO'd at something like an $80B valuation. There's only so much higher a taxi company can go and, unsurprising, they're worth less today than at IPO. Same thing with Snowflake - they're a miniscule niche database vendor who IPO'd at 1/4 the price of industry juggernaut Oracle so likely the very best return you could hope for is 4x."

It's easy to look at Apple now and think it was an easy stock play, but Apple went through some really lean years and its survival wasn't guaranteed.\n\nOn the other hand, those who believed in Apple in the 90s, invested in it despite its problems and held on as it skyrocketed, crushed it, IPO or not. Don't get fooled into thinking you need to be the first one in or you'll miss out, even if others are hyping that. You'll lose a lot of money that way (check out the charts for Rivian and Canoo)."

I know a story of a couple that sunk 10K into Apple after a tech show in that era and theyre millionaires today.\n\nThese days, IPOs are mostly vehicles for exit strategies for CEOs and other early stage founders to get a return on their investment, not invite the broader market to share in their success.\n\nI do think weve been in a crummy economic cycle for a few years that doesnt have the spending or enthusiasm to really drive success of new hotshot companies. But that doesnt last forever. And it doesnt mean there arent great companies that arent still making money. But investments take time."

     "Well, you might have had a similar viewpoint in 97-98-99. With the exception of the Covid flash  crash and subsequent subsidy-palooza, it's been a 12 or 13 year bull run since 2008. IPO's get pricey when money is easy. Money has been easy that entire time. It's only now starting to get back into normal historical range.\n\nAnother problem is hindsight. Google looked pricey when it IPO'ed at $85/share. From 2004 that would have been something like a 50 bagger, or a 70 bagger if you managed to sell near it's 2021 peak. ***But in 2004 you were paying $85 for a company that earned 10 cents. Y***ou need some real understanding of the franchise to project a 21% CAGR for two decades and make those numbers look like a bargain.\n\nThat wasn't clear to see in 2004, even though Google was the dominant search engine. Yahoo was the undisputed search king only a few years prior, so it wasn't hard to think maybe someone would displace Google in a few years down the road with an even better algorithm. We had recently witnessed Microsoft obliterate Netscape Navigator and Novell Netware. Cisco had just handed US Robotics and half a dozen other hardware manufacturers their hats.\n\nThe days you are talking about with cheap Apple were days it was left for dead. Today there are no doubt a few of those left for dead companies that look like roadkill and will find a path back to success.\n\nGamestop was labeled a zombie business prior to the console cycle, and they survived (so far). Before the squeeze they were just another disrupted retailer selling physical media in a digital world."

     "yes. IPOs have gotten harder bc everyone wanted to be early. But that was always dicey. Right now, \u201cinvesting early\u201d is probably looking for cyclical small cap opportunities that people have left for dead. esp companies that are on the cusp of going from losing money to making money, as that is often the start of a bull run when institutions will start to take positions. They are called cyclical bc they always come back. you can be earlier than the early guys there. offshore drillers was early two months ago and I think it is still early but some  have gone up 3x in the past month.\n\nGold and silver may be \u201cearly\u201d because they have been left for dead. Same with some copper miners, because copper has gone up but some small caps on the toronto or australian exchange have not gone up. same with uranium. there is a youtube channel called Crux Investor where guys from institutional backgrounds sit with companies of junior miner companies and really grill them. Some CEOs and companies seem to have \u201cit\u201d, where they hit their goals and they have assets that investors or other companies will want, and they have a clear plan to monetize them and unlock the value in the ground. no other sector will have their CEOs pay to sit down with an interviewer and get grilled like that in hopes that retail will listen. there is incredible alpha to be had there and some of those stocks have outperformed even in this environment where commodities stocks have suffered from recession fears and retail selling small caps (and it is really mostly retail participating in these small caps). You can be the smart money that buys from the dumb money here. I like Canadian nickel companies, African uranium miners, and any lithium or copper that has been dead money for the past few months and with the right management and assets.\n\nSome countries like Vietnam, Pakistan, South Africa, etc are going through huge issues and eventually, when things cannot get worse, will start to get better. I think it would be good to be invested in those countries at that point.\n\nlastly, and I am only in one bc I hate them, but SPACs with good structures that are in themes that will do insanely well in the next bull market have interesting warrants and decent deal structures. I\u2019m not going to say anything beyond that bc I know lots of people got burned by Chamath and Ackman but warrants can be had at good prices and the market will turn around by 2027. buying premerger when retail has left SPACs for dead.\n\nRight now, I am going to start watching Norfolk and Southern, specifically NSC/SPX chart, because NSC seems to track the S&P pretty well, with little deviation. If it vastly underperforms like it did in the covid crash, you can basically the S&P with a higher dividend yield and at a discount. That would be a buy and hold forever scenario if investors dump on the aftermath of the spill.\n\nRoaring Kitty explained deep  value investing pretty well: If you don\u2019t have one or two companies in your portfolio going bankrupt once in a while, you might not be taking on enough risk. If only he still did videos\u2026.."

Mainly, in my opinion though, the ability to raise capital & remain private longer than was thought possible just 15 years ago is the single biggest reason. In many cases, IPOs have become last resort for a strong company, and just a way to game the system and create individual wealth for weaker ones. A company like AAPL or AMZN IPO\u2019d and immediately put the money to good work. They were ready to blast off, and the cash infusion made it possible.

There wasn't so much venture capital to go around. These days, companies like Uber (which had been called a startup for almost a decade) run on VC money, incurring losses year after year all in hopes that in future, they shall be able to monetize their big customer-base. They cannot IPO because then they will have to worry about things such as Quarterly reports and free cash flows. An early stage startup is better positioned to have investors who believe in their vision long term to be able to sacrifice a lot short term gains for creating long-term value. In the past, there was only so much VC money and you eventually had to figure out a path to profitability and give the VCs their exit and turn to the markets for raising more money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's good in a way. With the low interest rates, there have been a lot of tech startups burning through cash in the name of growth.

     "Solid Economist article talking about the risks that these bank troubles are bringing to light and potential exposure, looking at the underlying issues rather than the troubled banks and their individual assets.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deep-rot-america-banking-industry-104028781.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deep-rot-america-banking-industry-104028781.html)\n\nBelow is an excerpt explaining the near term issue for some banks and the longer issue for any that take advantage of the asset swaps:\n\n\"Insured deposits are the stickiest because they are protected if things go wrong. So Ms Jiang and co-authors looked at uninsured cash. They found that if half of such deposits were to be withdrawn, the remaining assets and equity of 190 American banks would not be enough to cover the rest of their deposits. These banks currently hold $300bn in insured deposits.The newfound ability to swap assets at face value, under the Bank Term Funding Programme, at least makes it easier for banks to pay out depositors. But even this is only a temporary solution. For the Fed\u2019s new facility is something of a confidence trick itself. The programme will prop up struggling banks only so long as depositors think it will. Borrowing through the facility is done at market rates of around 4.5%. This means that if the interest income a bank earns on its assets is below that\u2014and its low-cost deposits leave\u2014the institution will simply die a slow death from quarterly net-interest income losses, rather than a quick one brought about by a bank run.\""

Proportionately, $50b is a *much* larger amount for European markets than $300b is for US markets, looking at GDP, total market cap etc. Yet despite this proportionately larger bailout, European markets are at -3.5 to -4% for the week while SPY is at +1.5%.\n\nWhy are European markets trailing US by 5-6% this week when proportionately, the $300b injected here should have less of a stimulating effect than the $50b there? Shouldn\u2019t the proportionately larger sum injected in Europe cause European markets to surge faster than SPY?

     "Reposting this since I didn't get any answers last thread:\n\nCould someone please explain the second paragraph about delta hedging in simple terms:\n\n> Some might wonder why a banking crisis is hitting oil so hard, as it is unlikely to impact crude demand and production. But during periods of elevated volatility, investors tend to pull out of risky assets like oil and invest in safer corners of the market. Oil prices have been very sensitive to the recent shift in risk sentiment, particularly due to the lack of supportive price fundamentals, with US oil inventories building this year.\n\n> What is intensifying the drop in prices is the options market, through so-called delta hedging. Financial institutions sold downside protection instruments (put options) to oil market players, for instance producers. With the oil price falling below the level where the protection kicks in (strike level), those financial institutions now need to avoid having a price risk on their balance sheets. So, they are selling crude futures to offset the risks, amplifying the rout.\n\nSo financial institutions sold puts to oil producers, say at a strike price of $80 a barrel. A put option gives the put-buyer the option to sell the underlying asset to the put-writer at the strike price before some expiration date. Say the market price falls to $75 a barrel. This means that the oil producer can sell oil at $80 to the financial firm, forcing the firm to buy oil at $5 more than the real market price. If prices fall even more, the firm takes even bigger losses.\n\nThe firm wants to offset this risk. So it sells crude futures. Can someone explain the exact details of how this works? (What would be the price of the sale? Would it be higher or lower than the current market price? Who gets the right to buy/sell?)"

The services segment has so much in store and it will improve Apple\u2019s margins that are already solid. \n\nFinancials are brilliant and they are really good at exceeding expectations from Wall Street. They have a huge warchest of money that they can use to improve the business. This huge pile of money makes their balance sheet healthy. Even dividends are growing if you\u2019re into that.\n\nI have to mention Tim Cook. He\u2019s such a good CEO. He\u2019s worked a long time at Apple and knows the company very well. If the rumours of the EV and VR are true, it makes Apple an even tastier (no pun intended). \n\nI\u2019m just gonna buy and hold. Simple as that.

     "AAPL is the best buy amongst mega cap techs. It is now selling at a 15% discount from its recent high and since then has been building a base around this 125-127 level.  The next big move should be up-up-up and all Apple has to do is just keep executing as it is doing.  The Epis lawsuit has been a drag recently, but realistically it is probably nothing more than a temporary PR cloud, the changes of a judge determining what Apple can charge on its platform is nill. The judge in this case has been pressuring Apple to compromise, but to allow unsecure aps to be sold on IOS without going through Apple's strict guidelines would defeat the whole purpose of IOS, that is a much safer place to be that Android or Windows. IOS has only about 1.2% of the malware, Android is around 25% and Windows is up around 35%. So bottomline is Apple is going to stand firm and likely defeat Epic. If they do compromise it will be a slight reduction, no lower than 25% and that won't hurt them much.  At 125 I consider APPL around 50% undervalued with very little downside risk especially since they have 100 billlion allocated for buybacks and love to buy their own stock whenever it does down."

     "Though these arent bad picks, I personally dont recommend it. Im a tech guy too but I play it much more defensively at a time when valuations are high. Remember its not just comparing valuation, there is also macro conditions to consider.\n\nFor example, right now, the entire market PE is in bubble territory with the S&P500 PE hovering around 45. Even though we can explain this rationally with covid earnings, low interest, bonds being dead money, inflation, and other things, markets are not rational.\n\nSo for me personally, I play defensive when the macro indicators are bad. Thats not to say I dont like AMZN, GOOG, APPL or MSFT, but that I dont trust valuations.\n\nRight now I am basically running 25% cash, and I would say 50% of my actual portfolio (not including the cash) is defensive. Consumer cyclicals, consumer non-cyclicals, blue chip with low PE+Div growth, real estate and I even have some fixed income (preferred stock for REITs I consider reliable long term).\n\nI would suggest you take the macro indicators into account. I also highly recommend a div paying strategy and letting the pot of cash build itself for dips and crashes.\n\nNow if markets PE starts to look good again (sub 30), then I would probably switch the strategy to what you are doing and just buy high growth cash cows. Which is what I basically did last year in the crash and in the financial crash though I didnt buy tech specifically this time around.\n\nAs a final disclosure, my 15 year performance is absurd using the flexible strategy above. Most dont believe it but its basically about 30% yoy growth... Not saying everyone can replicate this but as it turns out, like great chefs, great investors can come from anywhere."

     "You're comparing apples (pun intended) with oranges.  Germany practices a kind of Capitalism called \"Renish Capitalism.\"  This naturally impacts share prices.    We can debate later about whether the average German is happier than or lives better than the average American.  For now, here are some of the differences.\n\n\"In recent debates about the nature and future of capitalism, the United States and Germany are typically understood to represent opposing models  with  deep  historical  roots. In  the  realm  of  business  culture (Unter-nehmenskultur) and industrial relations, American business epitomizes a market-based, \u201chire-and-fire\u201d model of capitalism in which labor unions were never very powerful and have become virtually insignificant. German enterprises ... are still marked  by  a  socially  based,  corporatist  culture  (\u201cRhenish  capitalism\u201d) founded  on  strong  unions  and  labor  participation  in  management  (co-determination,  or Mitbestimmung).  \n\nMethods  of  finance  and  control  provide  a  second  point  of  contrast.  Shareholdings  in  most  large  American corporations are publicly traded and widely dispersed, salaried managers seem all-powerful, and US companies resemble commodities, easily bought  and  sold.  In  Germany,  a  \u201crelationship-based\u201d  system  predominates, in which large shareholders are more common and more powerful, while companies enjoy close relationships with banks, creating significant barriers to takeovers by holding large stakes in each other. \n\nA third element  concerns  their  respective  strengths  in  manufacturing.  American manufacturers still generally adhere to the style of mass production taken to its limits by Henry Ford, using specialized machines, narrowly defined skills, and closely supervised work processes. Their German counterparts excel,  as  they  have  historically,  at  more  flexible  forms  of  batch  or  customized  production,  relying  on  general-purpose  machines  and  skilled workers \n\nfrom  COMPARING U.S. AND GERMAN CAPITALISM  by Dunlavy and Welskopp"

     "Just to add some points. Many German companies are never going public and are quite small compared to US juggernauts. The intention behind this decision is simply to avoid problems with shareholders and publishing results. Companies like Trinamic or Beckhoff are only known to a few but they are quite influential by either developing new business models or new technology. It was the foundation of Germany's development after WW2. The reason for the low importance of shares was the absence of large pension funds, which are pumping money into the system, because Germany's pension system was organized collaborative, hence the current generation is paying for the pensions. \n\nThe notion of badly educated simpletons, the sum of prices of  shares is mirroring the success of an economy  is not just exaggerated and a mono causal explanation, it's stupid. The market for shares  can be a symptom for success and too much money at the same time. When investors and pension funds have a problem to find investment objects and the money is pushed into the stock market it becomes usually a problem for everyone, when the market makes a correction again. \n\nBut worse is the characterization of  European countries as \"socialist\", which is marking a typical US stupidity, by expanding the definition of a term until everything is fitting under the umbrella of this propaganda shit. I have no understanding for such idiots whether it is coming from Sanders or the GOP side. \n\nWhen shares of US companies are getting higher prices the reason might be the stream of money from Asia, because some investors might fear instability. It's the reason US bonds have a relative low yield. Only German bonds have or had  a lower yield."

Yes, the returns of the three stock portfolio look fantastic but i wouldn't invest solely in individual stocks (especially only 3) with anything but speculative free cash especially those as correlated as these three.\n\nYou mention chasing returns with small cap stocks, but that is all you are doing investing in 3 stocks based on their previous 5 yr performance.\n\nYou never know what the next black swan event will be, and that's why diversification is the way to go."

Everyone keeps talking about AI and how its a Iphone moment, its not. AI has been around for years. Chat GPT is just a new toy. AI like all technologies will continue to advance but i don't think NVDA will be the primary benefactor from continued technological advancement in the space. So i think this company is way overbought. The price should level off this month as rates move higher, inflation remains sticky and the treasury sells massive amount of bonds draining market liquidity. \\n\\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp\"",

Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:  \\n\\n\\n* **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier. \\n* **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty.\\n* **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts.

The move was prompted by high deposit outflows at the bank due to a broader downturn in the startup industry, analysts say.  SVB also forecast a sharper decline in net interest income.\n\nAll of that spooked a number of prominent venture capitalists, including Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund, Coatue Management and Union Square Ventures, who, according to sources, instructed portfolio businesses to limit exposure and pull their cash from the bank. Other VC firms have asked portfolio companies to at least shift some of their cash away from the bank, while a number have indicated they will stand by SVB.\n\nThroughout the day, our liveblog will have the latest developments on the fallout from Silicon Valley Bank.

     "Not sure the news is covering this enough but there seems to be a straight up banking collapse in Europe. A bunch of big European banks like Deutsch Bank, Barclays, UBS, Commerzbank etc are nearing or greater than -10% right after European markets opened (Deutsch Bank is at -15% and still free falling).\n\nWhat happens if one these big European banks implodes? I think that unlike SVB, these banks *are* system critical, like the European equivalent of JPM or BAC. And I may be wrong, but I don\u2019t think Europe *can* afford to bailout these banks. For example afaik the Swiss gov acknowledged that UBS is so big in proportion to Swiss GDP, tax revenue etc that the Swiss central bank literally cannot bailout UBS.\n\nWill the Fed offer to help bailout a failing European bank, to prevent a chain effect on our banks? Can the Fed even legally do so with what\u2019s in some way our money? We can afford it I think (see how much the Fed added to its balance sheet just last week alone, it\u2019s more than the GDP of some European countries), but would Americans even be okay with it?"

Drilling rigs in the US increased but barely:\n\n> The total rig count rose to 758 this week\u201488 rigs higher than the rig count this time in 2022 and 317 rigs lower than the rig count at the beginning of 2019, prior to the pandemic\n\nBut, and correct me if I'm wrong, more bullish news is that frac spreads rose significantly. In other words, more drilling crews 'completed' the work on drilled but not-completed wells. This means more oil can come online in the immediate future, but on a slightly longer time scale, means the DUC (drilled but uncompleted) well inventory decreases. This means tighter supply in the future."

It should be noted that TSLA now has a market cap higher than the combination of Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda all combined. It should also be noted that Toyota alone sells nearly 10 million cars and Tesla 500k..\\n\\nThis post is not about that thoughhowever Cathie Wood says that TSLA should be worth 3,000 easy, in her base case. \\\\[Mind you she just dumped along with insiders that sell every day of the week check form 4\\\\] Whatever is the case if TSLA is 3,000 a share it will rival the largest company in the world AAPL.

It goes against Apple's very business model, which is high margin.  \n\nTim Cook has gotten rid of profitable products simply because the margins are not high enough.  Right now Apple could make an Apple branded monitor with the same design motif as its laptops and sell tons of them.  It would not even have to stock them in Apple stores, maybe just a demo model with ordering online.  It got rid of monitors because the it is a low margin product.  In fact because of low margins, Cook has basically disassembled what used to be the Apple hardware ecosystem with its printers, routers, monitors, and such.\n\nIt does not make sense for Apple to get into a business that requires huge capital outlays, is very cyclical, and often has low to no profits"

The latest bull run to $150 has a lot of high expectations riding behind it. It's going to need to do more than marginally beat earnings estimates to support its current value. How do you think the price will behave after earnings tomorrow? Are we going to see a repeat of the past few earnings? Curious if anyone has some insight to share.\"",

The iPhone, iPad and new Macs should continue to sell very well. Just looking around, I know a bunch of people who got a new iMac just now (women seem to LOVE the color options).\n\nMy concern is Apple TV+ turning into a money sink. I canceled it because I don't have time to watch their content as it's not good enough. I also have no desire to have multiple stagnating subscription services. Everybody has Disney and Netflix, and Netflix just got crushed a bit.\n\nWhere does this leave Apple? When will it start to show in the earnings and what will be the consequences of it? Producing content is expensive, and without content the service is dead in the water."

     ">The way I see it, it would have been better to sell at a loss a week ago, saved $1,000 bucks, then buy again once AAPL started to gain.\n\nGoogle \"wash sale rule\". If you sell for a loss and then rebuy within 30 days, the irs thinks you're trying to harvest a tax loss and will just go ahead and add your loss back to your cost basis.\n\nRegardless, trying to time the market in this way is exactly what leads to buying high and selling low. You can see today that selling a week ago would have been beneficial but what if the stock had started going up again right after you sold? We can't see into the next week today, and you don't know if the price will start marching back up starting tomorrow or continue into the toilet.\n\nBecause we can't predict the future, unless there is a relevant headline or announcement that changes the long term outlook of a stock, **you want to use times like this to buy more and lower your cost basis**.\n\nUnfortunately it sounds like you don't have more money to buy more. You can avoid this in the future by starting a new position with a small buy and adding to it over time, and learning about indicators like RSI which can help inform you on when a stock is likely overbought and oversold. You went in with 100% of your cash when the RSI was above 70 which is a huge no-no.\n\nBut that's the past and your job now is to 1. learn from this experience and 2. not panic sell."

If yes then I\u2019m good to invest that. If no then don\u2019t invest it.\nRule 2. I don\u2019t invest to short or make quick profits. I like to think I invest for the years to come. Example, some people buy Tesla stock short term for quick profits...I bought some Tesla a few years ago for $300 and people called me a retard when it went down to $180 something. I considered selling when it hit $600.  No way it could go up further right? I decided to hold on. Enjoy the ride. Then it went up to almost $2,300 then split.

     "Apple as a business is fundamentally strong. I believe that you would most probably make profits in the long term.\n\nI think there is a better alternative to your proposed solution. As you already hold the share of Apple, you could do a covered call at a price lot higher than what you would be comfortable selling the stock.\n\nFor example, if you had bought the stock at $118 and you are happy to sell the stock at $200. Sell a 45 days to expiry call option at a strike of $200.\n\nPossible scenarios at the expiry of the option:\n\n**Scenario 1 - Apple is trading at a price below the strike price of the option (let's say $130 as an example)**\n\nYou get to keep the premium received on selling the call option (minus the brokerage charges) and nothing to lose.\n\n**Scenario 2 - Apple is trading at a price above the strike price of the option (let's say $210 as an example)**\n\nProfit made = $200 (strike price) - $118 (price at which you bought) + **premium received by selling the option** \\- brokerage charges\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe only lost opportunity in this trade setup is that if Apple really shoots up a lot more than the call option strike price, you lose out on the extra profit that could have been made by selling it at that price. To increase your odds of such a thing not happening, you could select a strike price that you think Apple stock most probably cannot reach till the expiry. In the above example, Apple reaching $200 in the next 45 days has very little probability. This would allow you to make some money (premium).\n\nFinally, as a trader one must not care about which direction the stock (or market) moves. You must be able to make profit in any scenario.\n\nHope this helps."

That's typical of bubbles: first they kill speculative fare, then small caps and growth and finally they shoot down the blue chips. At that point the whole market starts to tank since there isn't anything else left to park money into.\n\nFor the past year they've been parking money into real estate and commodities which also became overvalued, so the only option left is to go abroad for those funds that are allowed to invest internationally. Though we have splendid bubbles in foreign real estate and in some emerging markets such as India as well.\n\nI think that they are gradually repositioning in expectation of a crash next year as the Fed starts tapering off and then increasing rates.\n\nOf course retail will be the last to know. When the market starts tanking in earnest and hedge funds are done taking their short positions then they will push doom and gloom through the financial media to scare retail into panic selling. A trick as old as the world but it never fails.\n\nIt should be interesting to see how crypto fares in all this. I think that it will crash and burn despite the propaganda that it is \"digital gold\". The \"everything bubble\" will likely end up in the \"everything crash\".\n\nI also expect that the China story will start to change. After all, it is the only major market that looks undervalued (at least in the tech sector), though Chinese real estate is not a good place to be.

     "Grab a drink, for I have some labor market data to share. Folks, we've been glooming about bank credit, Fed rate hikes, and inflation. But despite all that, we have *fantastic* trends in the labor market that all of us should celebrate.\n\n----\n\nI posted a few months ago about how tech unemployment actually *decreased* from Dec 2022 to January 2023. [Here is the comment I made in mid February](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/112uzdy/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_feb_15_2023/j8po699/). \n\nThe summary:\n\n> In January [2023] the tech unemployment rate fell to 1.5% from 1.8% in December, according to CompTIA's analysis. \n\nThat same firm released their update following today's job numbers. It seems it went from 1.5% to 2.2% in February, and then stayed constant at 2.2% in March. I can't access their full report. But even despite that, job posting increased to 316K.\n\n> Tech industry employment, covering all workers employed by technology companies, experienced a **modest decline of an estimated 839 jobs last month**. Telecommunications accounted for the largest share of the decline at -3,100 positions, which was offset by gains in cloud infrastructure, tech services and software.            \n> \n> **Employer job postings for tech positions increased by 76,546 month-over-month, to a total for March of nearly 316,000. This represents the highest level of employer hiring activity as measured by job postings in seven months.**\n> \n> **Technology employment across all industry sectors increased by an estimated 197,000 positions** for the month, according to CompTIA\u2019s analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics #JobsReport data. The **unemployment rate** for tech occupations held **steady at 2.2%**.\n\nSo yeah, there is no reason to doom over the tech sector's labor market. Unemployment is 40% smaller than the overall unemployment rate; this is among some of the highest paid occupations; layoffs concentrated among large tech companies that overhired but offer incredibly strong severance packages.\n\n---\n\nIn other good news, we are near/at [*record high* levels of Black prime age employment rates](https://i.imgur.com/ej2Pxmj.png): \"Now at 78.1%, 0.6% above the pre-pandemic peak, and now just 0.6% from the all-time high in 1999.\" For the first time years and maybe even ever, [Black employment rates are higher than White employment rates](https://i.imgur.com/0YxTRwY.png), although age differences in the population between demographics plays a major role in this. If you adjust for age it's slightly lower instead. Here are decades of [Black unemployment rates](https://i.imgur.com/BauLPwl.png).\n\n[Prime age employment (across all Americans) highest in *20 years*](https://i.imgur.com/2z9WD0R.png). \n\nAs pointed about by Joseph Politano on Twitter:\n\n> - Highest prime-age employment rate in decades. \n> - Highest female prime-age employment rate ever. \n> - Highest Black prime-age employment rate ever. \n> - Highest Asian prime-age employment rate ever. \n\nA strong labor markets benefits the disabled too: Just marvel [at this chart](https://i.imgur.com/XaC4voE.png).\n\n----\n\nWealth inequality. Is inflation hitting the poor the hardest? Probably yeah. But guess what a strong labor market does? [Increases wealth for the poorest Americans](https://i.imgur.com/CgBD15v.png).\n\n> \n> Wealthiest 0.1% of Americans saw 5.0% of their wealth disappear from the quarter before the Fed started hiking rates in 2022Q1 to 2022Q4\n> \n> The next 0.9% saw 7% of their wealth disappear\n> \n> In contrast, the least-wealthy half of Americans saw their (much smaller) wealth rise 17%\n\n--\n\nArin Dube points out:\n\n> It took around 12 years for prime-age (25-54yo) employment-to-population rate to recover after the recession following the financial crisis.\n\n> It took around 3 years after the recession following pandemic.\n\n---\n\nIs inflation eating away at wages? Not at the bottom quantiles of earnings! [Figure](https://i.imgur.com/uyBYew0.png).\n\n---\n\nTakeaway: Don't bet against the American consumer. More of us are working, across all races, ability, genders. Our wages are going up, especially those at the bottom quantiles of earnings, and faster than inflation for those lower income earners. That's a lot of disposable income ready to pour right back into the economy."

     "Microsoft lost a lot of developer mindshare in the 2010s.\n\nMeaning that the people who write software have long ago switched from the Microsoft platform, developer tools and stacks.\n\nMost modern software development (at scale) is being done with Java and Javascript.  AWS is pretty dominant in cloud hosting.  \n\nA lot of micro services architectures leveraging Docker and open source stacks running on linux.\n\nA lot of the workstations used by developers are latest and greatest Apple MacBook Pro machines.\n\nThis is just my \u201cman on the ground\u201d perspective.\n\nI\u2019m sure Microsoft has a lot of \u201ccash cow\u201d products that they continue to charge for but I don\u2019t really see it as a \u201cgrowth\u201d company that can innovate.  \n\nOnce developers have switched their workstation platforms and have gone full open source as far as the platform they deploy their software to, you\u2019ve lost innovation and control of the future.  Like it or not, Microsoft Windows is not going to be the operating system that powers cloud platforms of the future.  \n\nIt\u2019s not really about Apple versus Microsoft. It\u2019s about open-source versus licensed platforms and developer mindshare.  \n\nThrough extremely disingenuous business practices, Microsoft has managed to alienate a huge share of the developer population. They will never use Microsoft platforms or tools again.  They treat any mention of Microsoft tools, stacks or platforms with suspicion.  They know that with Microsoft there is always a catch. \n\nA huge problem that Microsoft has is that of licensing software at scale.  You need to license every running instance of Microsoft software.  This makes it impossible to scale up because every computing unit that you add you have to pay a license for to Microsoft.  Modern software has to scale up and out.  This just becomes impossible from a licensing perspective with Microsoft. It\u2019s much better to go with a free open source stack.\n\nMicrosoft has licensing terms built into their developer tools that can rob you blind.  They also force you to keep using their platform by locking you into their ecosystem from the time you have a MVP. (Minimum Viable Product)  This is built-in to the software lifecycle when you use Microsoft development tools.  Microsoft also creates artificial problems and gaps for which you need to buy another Microsoft product.  \n\nThey do this purposely in order to get more of your money.  It is though they have perfected the art of capturing your money.  The more needs you have and the more problems you need to solve, the more money you have to pay Microsoft.\n\nThis has driven many developers over a tipping point where they never want to have anything to do with any Microsoft product or platform in the future.  Ever again.\n\nThat\u2019s a terrible reputation to have as a business with your core audience.  \n\nUltimately a successful software business (SaaS, platform, tools) is built on developer mind share.  Ensuring that developers use your offerings to build new software. \n\nThat is not happening with Microsoft. There is a lot of old software that was built using Microsoft tools but nothing new.\n\nI\u2019d say long-term bet against Microsoft.  \n\nBet on amazon AWS.  Bet on Atlassian.  Bet on IntelliJ.  Bet on Mirantis / Docker.  \n\nBet on companies offering IaaS to open source software scalable stacks and software architectures.  Like amazon AWS.  \n\nDon\u2019t bet on companies whose whole business model is capturing licensing revenue from every part of the software lifecycle.  \n\nDon\u2019t bet on Oracle or Microsoft.  They are thinking about software in terms of nickel and diming you for every little thing.  License costs for every component of your architecture.\n\nDevelopers are moving to a free open source model where the software they write will run on architectures that are made up of open source software components.  \n\nThis way, it might cost money to develop (the tools cost money, your Apple laptop costs money) but to run the end product you won\u2019t need to pay any licensing cost.  You will still pay for IaaS costs, but nothing else to run the software that you write."

They haven't been buying as many companies as microsoft but are sitting on A LOT of cash. Every product they seem to release either becomes a sensation, an eventual revenue source or ppl forget that it failed. From an engineering perspective the company is a lot more focused on innovation, internal R&D, has more 'innovative' teams and is the go to destination for engineers in the hardware space compared to microsoft. From a business perspective their future products will all probably have some sort of subscription model which is great cash flow and people love the brand enough to get into it , see Apple Card.\n\nThis was purely me saying stories tho. Msft seems to be a better buy right now marginally but apples brand is too strong to count it out."

     "Apple was severely undervalued when it was at a sub 14 PE. It has annual revenues coming in larger then most large cap companies entire market value. People finally woke up the fact that the company basically prints money and is arguably the most shareholder friendly company to ever exist. They buy back 10\u2019s of billions of dollars of stock every year and pay a fast growing dividend on top of that and have one of the stickiest ecosystems and moat. People will say they lost their touch and can\u2019t innovate anymore but I strongly disagree. Airpods alone are worth ~100b if they were their own company. Apple Watch is incredibly useful and is becoming more health related with its capabilities....I mean that thing can tell when your dehydrated, blood pressure...pretty soon it will be able to tell you if your blood sugar is low for those people who are diabetic (It has an app but you need another separate device it links too afaik). Their services are growing very fast, AppleTV has been pretty successful on its own as well. They adapt to changing landscapes and overcome by simply doing things more efficiently and better imo. They\u2019re now making their own ARM chips for macs and getting away from Intel which I think will increase their margins. They may not making something new and fantastic every single year or even every two years...they take their time and do things right. So once in a while they have a huge hit (Airpods, Watch) that just owns the market and makes shit tons of money. They play the long game and run their company as such. Time of the friend of a wonderful business and the enemy of a mediocre one. Who knows what they will bring to the market in the next decade but I can almost guarantee it will be a hit and I want to be a part of that. \n\nDisclosure I hold Apple as 31% of my portfolio."

However, market conditions and company performance and fundamentals all play a role in this valuation.\n\nOver this past year they\u2019ve seen continued success in their hardware, captured iPhone market share in Asia (which has been a challenge), and have shown growth in their services. Going forward, iPhone sales may be stagnant but their wearables are still growing. Services will continue to grow. They will improve margins and performance on computers by switching to their in house chips. They will likely continue to perform well in emerging markets, and they probably have a plans for the company that have not yet been disclosed to the public. \n\nAll of this alone, may not justify their additional 1T in one year however we are in very strange and uncertain time in the market. Any headline can cause stocks to soar or tank. Investors want stability and steady growth so they look toward ETFs, certain value stocks, and FAANG. This inflates Apples valuation even more. Even compared to the rest of the FAANG they have the least exposure to risk. I mean they Have cash reserves greater than Netflix\u2019s entire Market Cap.\n\nAlso the hype from the split has attracted a lot of retail investors, but I imagine that has minimal effect on their valuation. I personally think they are overvalued right now, but I will always hold APPL and add little more whenever there is a slight dip"

AAPL's key to growth is services, which is largely the app store (which is also the center of monopoly accusations). \n\nServices is rapidly growing and APPL takes a ~30% cut of any sales through the app store, including when customers subscribe to other services, be it Spotify, New York Times, Headspace, etc. This 30% is essentially pure-margin--AAPL doesn't have many costs associated here and it's essentially acting as a gatekeeper to iPhone users and taking a big cut of revenue from other companies.

At what point should I say that its too high and wait for it drop? I know its not really 2nd hand knowledge on how to time the market, but whats everyones opinion on whats too high to pay for a share?'",

     " \n\nSo a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.\n\nSuch a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.\n\nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.\n\nHow to use it?\n\n1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.\n2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).\n3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line\n4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line\n5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line\n6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).\n\nYou can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)\n\nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!\n\nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  \na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  \nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them\n\nThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).\n\nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."

Then when you get a big downturn you have the capital to buy those dips. Just remember to never sell.\n\nShort term investing or even perhaps momentum investing those are entirely different strategies. That is where doing your research comes into play and what value you think Apple stock should be compared to where it current is. And in that case you would probably want to do Options. That way you can look at different news and try to forecast what you think is coming and then try to hedge your bets with different strategies, because IMO Options are pure gambling.\n\nYou can also try to use the volatility as a gauge. It is like the calm before the storm. Low volatility generally means the price is too high and others are thinking the same thing. You can probably grab better deals during periods of high volatility. There will always be some news that breaks that you didn\u2019t uncover during your research."

No DD there thats just optimism on Disney+ and parks and cruises being bag at 100% capacity eventually.

Kids today have anime, video games, Twitch, Youtube videos, etc to entertain them.

But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. \n\nSame with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. \n\nmy view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.\n\nmeantime the biggest market yet to be breached imo is home robots. M3gan is the most insightful movie on this. Its way off though, the hype is not the truth with home robots yet. but AI first."

     "So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.\n\nSuch a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.\n\nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.\n\nHow to use it?\n\n1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.\n2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).\n3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line\n4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line\n5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line\n6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).\n\nYou can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)\n\nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!\n\nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  \na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  \nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them\n\nThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).\n\nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."

There is no reason our current home went up 40% in 2 years and similar homes are still selling in under a week with the higher rates.

In the meantime we just bleed.\n\nTbh some part of me feels disgusted at hoping for layoffs to start just so we finally have a sign that the recession people have constantly talked about for the past year is finally here, and we can move on and hopefully a new growth cycle starts in the next year or so, and I can stop losing money. Maybe I\u2019m just not cut out for the stock market and should just stay out of it"

     "Hello everyone, I have a trading account that I started back NOV 2020 that some of my friends and family said they wanted me to trade their money.  It\u2019s not big and they are all lifetime friends (about 5k for 2x people and 1k x 2, 12k total start) Well I\u2019m doing quite well and mostly sell premium in slow movers aiming for 10%apr.  anyway, one wants to double their initial investment.\n\nIm trying to figure out a way to easily caluculate their share without having to basically \u201ccash out\u201d the account on paper each time one makes a contribution, but obviously I can\u2019t just add 5k to the initial starting value of the account.  \n\nI was trying to figure out how to come up with a share/dividend system but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m thinking about it right.  I\u2019m thinking to make every share worth $100 and each time someone makes a contribution, it I \u201cpay a dividend\u201d which is immediately reinvested.  \n\nI\u2019m betting someone will say something about taxes, well I\u2019ve told them I\u2019ll be charging the taxes when they withdraw the money and im personally keeping track of the amount each year in a spreadsheet.  But the tax rate is pretty close within a percentage point since my income is in the 50k range.  \n\nAm I overthinking or do I just need to reset the total numbers anytime there is a contribution to the pot?\n\nEdit:  calm down guys.  This is play money for them.  They are doctors and veterinarians.  This is play money for them.  They lose this amount in a single Vegas trips from time to time.  This isn\u2019t life changing money for them.  If I told them \u201cI need 5k to fix my car,\u201d I\u2019d have it in my bank account by end of day.  This is more of another excitement play for them and they get a laugh at it."

The company has told its component suppliers\\nthat demand for the iPhone 13 lineup has weakened, people familiar with the matter said, signaling that some consumers have decided against trying to get the hard-to-\\nfind item, Bloomberg News reports.\\nAlready, Apple had cut its iPhone 13 production goal for this year by as many as 10 million units, down from a target of 90 million, because of a lack of parts, Bloomberg News reported. But the hope was to make up much of that shortfall next year, when supply is expected to improve. The company is now informing its vendors that those orders may not materialize, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.*\\n\\nLooks like Christmas is cancelled, folks.

Hall has been bearish on Apple\u2019s stock since April 2020.\n\n\u201cAs a result we continue to expect iPhone replacement rates to resume their ongoing decline in 2021,\u201d he wrote, helping drive his below-consensus forecasts for the full year and particularly the second half of the year. \u201cIn addition, our negative thesis on Apple is based on [average selling prices] remaining roughly unchanged in 2021 as consumers shift toward lower priced iPhones and this seems to be beginning to play out in supply chain orders.\u201d\n\nThe analyst is worried that Apple is cutting production orders, while customers are beginning to prefer lower-priced iPhones compared to their more expensive counterparts. On the shorter term, however, Hall does believe that Apple will report a strong holiday quarter given \u201csolid consumer demand.\u201d\n\nAnd while the COVID-19 pandemic has limited people\u2019s ability to spend on things like travel and eating out, potentially leaving them with more spending money for electronics like Apple products, the analyst believes that a shift to out-of-home spending as the economy starts to reopen could be a \u201cnegative catalyst\u201d for the Cupertino company\u2019s shares.\n\n\u201cWe believe the shift of consumer disposable income toward vacations, restaurants, and other outside of the home spending as re-opening occurs is likely to act as a negative catalyst for Apple\u2019s stock just as COVID lockdowns represented a tailwind,\u201d writes the analyst."

If you take a 3 year view, it has performed as well as any FAANG stock. It is sitting at a similar P/E ratio to FB and GOOGL, yet expected earnings and revenue growth are significantly lower than those companies (which is expected, as they're predominantly software and easier to scale). Therefore it's healthy for the APPL stock to slow down for a while.\n\nIf you'd like to feel good about the APPL stock performance, just look at AMZN and FB which have fared worse, placing APPL in the mid-range for FAANG performance. The APPL stock performance has beat the NASDAQ 100 on the 3 year view, and year-on-year, is only a little under the NASDAQ 100, which is good for a company of its size."

I sold a lot of my value stocks (LMT, VZ, BTI, MRK, etc) and feel much better sitting in Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nI think TSM is a great business and is a juggernaut right now. One option is you just buy a small bucket of stocks and don\u2019t look at this as either-or. The two industries I know very well are cloud tech and semiconductors and I own more of Amazon than anything else followed by Microsoft.

     "I like both and own both. I have more Apple than Disney because it\u2019s just been a strong horse for me over the years and the dividends is a nice bonus in recent years. I think Apple still has a solid growth story and it\u2019ll continue to expand its subscription model. They might expand their product and services. Not sure what. You have Apple so I would add more to Disney to balance it out. I don\u2019t think Disney will go back to dividends but those were nice and the only reason I held on to Disney at $85/share for so many years. It had done literally nothing until it added Disney plus. That recurring revenue stream is going to be a key business driver. I think the movie distribution industry is going to change a lot post COVID and Disney is poised to win here with their platform. \n\nAside from movies, they have amazing content that they could spin off from just the marvel universe alone (eg Wanda Vision, etc). Parks will reopen eventually. P/E on these companies are high but who knows what investors are looking for anymore. Long term, I don\u2019t think you can go wrong."

(yes, i realize they probably won't \"make\" a car and will probably just partner with a company that does while providing self-driving and various other tech, but the point still stands)\n\nas far as investing **now** goes, aapl is down a bit, while dis is at all time highs. timing wise, aapl is definitely a better pickup right now. of course, rather than going all in on one with what you go for, i'd probably put like 80% in there and then put 20% in something that isn't either of them but has the chance to grow much larger (like increasing your PLTR holdings, or grabbing SFT or something like that)"

There are other companies that have taken it on the chin a lot more than these two.   I know that doesn\u2019t help but you\u2019re not down 70-90%.\n\nThese situations sucks.   Sometimes it\u2019s better to move on and sometimes it\u2019s better to hold.  No one knows.   The only way to look at it is this:  Today would you buy the stock?  Is the story the same?  And if so what would your target price be?  \n\nYou need to look at their financials, growth prospects, current market environment, and make a new decision.  If you\u2019re down 40% you need them to go up 80% to break even.  Is that even possible?   Dunno \n\nI\u2019ll use PTON as an example.  Personally I would bet 100-1 that it will never see +100 ever again.  Probably not 50.  Personally don\u2019t think it will ever go over 20.   So if I bought it at 80 and had the above beliefs I would have to suck it up sell it and move on.

     "Health warning, I\u2019m not a professional, just a Redditor.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should *always* but it depends on a few things.\n\nI see my cash as an asset that will grow and I will move it to the place I think it will grow the most. I have two categories. Long term growth and short term.\n\nRecently I sold two holdings in two companies that were perfectly fine stocks, but I had lost a bit on each, a legacy of the last eighteen months. I didn\u2019t expect any short term growth in either. I used the money to buy stock in a company I just knew was temporarily undervalued and would grow quicker short term. I was right. My strategy is to let that growth continue to happen, likely sell, then re-evaluate where that money goes at that point. It may go back to the original stocks or something else. We will see.\n\nThat money, at that time, was just more useful to me to take advantage of that specific opportunity. \n\nOn the other hand I do have other money in stocks that are sitting, in some cases, with slight losses that I am content to hold for the moment, and likely long term. I anticipate those stocks are every bit as likely to grow as any others I could move the money to, and they anchor my portfolio in reliable stocks that I am confident in, and are unlikely to significantly crash. \n\nI think it\u2019s important not to panic sell in most cases, but instead to constantly evaluate where your money is going to do the most work for you at that time. And on top of those judgements it\u2019s important to have balance. I could conceivably have just moved ALL my money to that stock I mentioned above to reap short term rewards, but I\u2019m also aware that my judgement is fallible, I don\u2019t have all the facts, and events outside of my control could intervene and undermine my analysis of the short term viability of that stock. So my long term stock picks are my anchor to protect against volatility."

So for me, I make more by holding stocks more than 3 years (and I been bagholiding CRSP for a while). And my reason is simple, I think I can predict technological progress better than the market, because the market is usually sus on new things and they give it too much risk.\n\nNow, when you're investing in health stocks in particular you should be aware that they live and die by the FDA trials. Especially companies with upcoming, not yet proven drugs, they'll slide downwards for years because trial progress is usually hidden.

If you would buy it now then hold the stock. \n\nThat\u2019s what most people say, and it\u2019s true. But the question you are probably wondering is: my stock is down 40% and it\u2019s getting trashed, so what does everyone know that I don\u2019t? I don\u2019t have a good answer. Here are a few random thoughts:\n\n1. When Buffett talks about holding, it\u2019s easier when he\u2019s investing in Coke or whatever. Coke is almost always worth keeping and buying 40% lower. \n\n2. A smaller stock is usually more volatile than the blue chips - if your stock is a small cap then the 40% dip might be fine. \n\n3. The broader market drives a significant portion of your individual stock\u2019s attention. Just because the whole market is moving in response to macro events doesn\u2019t mean your individual stock is getting riskier - UNLESS macro climate uniquely impacts your stock. For example, do bank failures uniquely impact your stock?\n\n4. Be honest with yourself about your thesis. Are you just hoping? An example: if I\u2019m buying Okta, do I really believe that here growth is going to continue at 40% y/y. Well, that\u2019s a guess. If IRL that user growth is not happening then you can\u2019t hope for it to happen."

If you're an American, this figure will appear on Form 1040 Schedule D of your tax return.\n\nUsually, one sells the losing position and uses the money to purchase replacement shares in a similar but not identical investment. With ETFs or mutual funds this is a simple operation -- for instance, exchanging VTI for VOO or VV -- but with individual securities it's a little less straightforward. Since you mentioned wanting to start investing in index funds going forward, you could sell your position in CRSR and use the money to buy an index fund. The loss will then be realized, and will show up on the 1099-B your broker will send you at the beginning of the following year (again, assuming you're an American).  \n\nA 40% loss definitely hurts, but in your position I would consider selling, realizing the tax advantage, and moving to index funds as soon as possible. After all, a position that has [lost 40% of its capital will require a 67% gain just to break even](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Percentage_gain_and_loss), and all the while you risk losing even more of your capital by maintaining the position.\n\nThere's no shame in taking a loss occasionally with your investments, particularly when you're young and don't have a family depending on you.

They are far from 100% of the phone/pc/device market, and there are still ways they can capture more revenue from its users from the app store, fintech, streaming media, and so on.  Eventually it will start reaching a limit, but I don't see that limit yet.  The bigger risk around Apple is its dependency on Asia for production and sales, and how China may upset all that."

The data they have on viewer preferences is the best and I think they are able to leverage this against competition that may need higher per sub investment to develop the write content mix.\n\nI would also reframe your point about their competition. You could argue they have a competitive advantage as a pure play in the space. The other big names are diversified and while that brings resource and expertise I think in the end, higher capex properties, like media production and distribution, may be candidates for divestitures/spin offs.

Although they are cheaper than before i wouldnt compare to previous levels as it wouldnt mean much.\n\n I prefer to pick my investment without using as little assumptions as possible: I picked META at $92 (250B cap at the time, 180B assets,  $105b tangible, 60B cash and marketable securities, strong FCF on a TTM, strong rev and margins close to peak) but im getting ready to sell incase things go south since things seem to be going to well for my liking.  I also chose to invest in DIS (got in at $90ish) instead of NFLX although retrospectively i would have done much better doing the opposite, but i still think it is better from a risk/reward perspective."

     "I have a great degree of respect for Netflix as a tech company because they have been a legitimate innovator in terms of building a very intelligent SoA system, tons of microservices, their architecture and blogs are very fascinating reads to see how a world class organization handles it's data and systems. They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.\n\nHowever today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.\n\nMiddle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.\n\nNetflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. \n\nI think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience. A true event that they have to capture at the designated time because otherwise they feel left out when their peers are talking about it."

Their clueless execs have pledged to keep increasing content spend, which they can't afford, and soon, won't be able to finance either.  And content costs will be bid up by their much richer competitors.  \n\nThey hit customer saturation several years ago, and hid it with their silly metrics.  They hit price saturation at covid re-opening.  So they can't grow subs, and they can't charge them more... but they have to.  Their funky and false way of claiming \"profitability\" won't hold up to tougher scrutiny.\n\nThey're doing their usual shell game of pretending there's growth with the shiny object of ad-tier.  But you don't make an ad-service that requires customers to sign up and pay.  That's why they had to refund all their advertisers.  And the ad-tier will cannibalize their existing subs/pricing anyway."

     ">It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers.\n\nIt's not a vicious cycle, it's theoretically a virtuous cycle when done correctly. In fact, it is the bedrock of Netflix's business model. [Check out Netflix's flywheel](https://jenvandermeer.org/2020/06/09/netflix-business-model-teardown/)\n\nYou cannot compare Google and Netflix. They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)\n\nAlso, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).\n\nTheir gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. \n\nTLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't. Very different companies."

I wouldn't necessarily be scared at 11% concentration, but you need to determine what your risk tolerance is for you.\n\nIf you do decide you want to sell, perhaps consider selling covered calls (presuming you have at least 100 shares).  It allows you to capture a little extra upside, and if it drops...you got some premium while your holdings drop back to a non-outsized position.  When it rises again, sell more calls.\n\nIf dropping 100 shares is too much, I would wait until it finishes another strong run (obviously hard to call a top).  AAPL is trending up but isn't at an all time high.  Unless you're losing sleep over it, I would wait to see what it does after earnings this week.  If it has a strong pop after earnings, probably your time to trim.  If not...again, you're probably back to a position you can leave alone until it becomes an outsized part of your portfolio again.\n\nAt the end of the day, do what works for you, and whatever allows you to sleep better at night without worrying/thinking about it."

Apple is for the rich or for people who are extremely safe and conservative and scared of their own shadow. You could also use it to hedge a lot of high risk plays. If I had half a million dollars, I would put it into AAPL bc I would be down to make a certain 250k with it in a couple years. I would never put 500 dollars into AAPL because  wtf is the point. However, as a buyer of Apple, you should know this and should not be expecting decent gains (like 35% maybe) for another year. Wait for a FB dip (they come all the time) and buy that instead.

Could pay off but the odds are not on your side.\n\nYou could have opened a bull call spread at $145/$150 for the same expiration date for a $2.70 debit. This trade will yield an 85% return so long as AAPL is trading at $150 at expiration, more or less where it is today.\n\nFor comparison, the $165 call closed today at $1.79. So you would need Apple to close at $168.31 in order to get the same rate of return as the spread trade. That means to get the same return, the stock price needs to be 12.2% higher than it does for the spread. The risk/reward is pretty unfavorable.\n\nI like the spread, but I would not have bought the $165 call. There\u2019s too much uncertainty in today\u2019s prices to make that a safe bet. I\u2019d have been more likely to support this trade a year ago when the market was 25% lower.\n\nHaving said that, AAPL is a rock solid company and this could print if the economy stays on track and AAPL has a good earnings call and blowout iPhone launch.

The transitory explanation for inflation said it was all temporary supply chain issues. Then we all said transitory was wrong because it turns out we just had a booming economy flush with money. Then why is inflation cooling?

Meaning, sales were not lost but just pushed back. \n\nAlso, services was 20% of total revenue with 70%+ margins. It grew slightly but it is too hard to ignore at this point and the PE expansion is justified. Look at some of the other software companies' PE. \n\nWith 2B installed base upgrading every few years and buying up other products/services in the meantime, Apple did great considering the environment."

I held through Q1 Earnings and even though Apple beat estimates (Not to mention revenue of 100 billion fucking dollars) the stock basically flatlined and even fell to a low of about 115 in the last few months. \\n\\nIm wondering yalls thoughts on if I should sell right before earnings this time around or if I should hold through them. Personally leaning towards selling right before, but maybe with latest round of stimmy and shit Apple could rise after earnings? (Im assuming they will beat earnings again, but God knows if that will do anything)\\n\\n*I am not planning on holding long-long term, so its either sell before earnings or hold through and sell after earnings hoping it pops.'",

I likely wouldn't have sold even halfway to it, as my \"oh crap\" capital preservation instincts would kick in\n2. I'm lucky to have made any money.

I screwed up buying silver the day before it crashed.. I\u2019ve made several other big screw ups, but you get the point. There are so many things we do right, but one thing I have learned is that you never make a hasty decision. When your gut is telling you something, dig into why it is doing it. When you\u2019re compelled to act.. take at least a second while you\u2019re coherent to reconsider. How do you go on?

The worst case scenario is kind of already priced in.\n\nSo it leaves you with a very realistic upside risk IMO.\n\nPlus: even if they loose market share (I think they will, a little), the Cloud market is growing exponentially (demand) whereas CPU/GPU performance is no longer growing exponentially, so the CPU market will have to grow exponentially as well, follow my logic?  There's going to be a need for MUCH more CPU in the future.\n\nAlso: In the meantime, you get paid a very nice dividend, so even if the stock doesn't grow, you've made money.\n\nI've read their last i5 is faster than the best AMD by the way, but that's not even my point."

     "Several stocks I own are selling off or are at attractive prices. Adding to CLFD, UFPI, FCX, PSCE.\n\n- CLFD has been trading around low 60s even after an excellent ER, mostly due to analyst fears about backlog falling and seasonality. Fundamentally very strong company that is very cheap right now.\n- UFPI is trading down some 8% just because... it was reclassified as a mid-cap stock instead of small-cap? This company has been thriving the entire time, pays a dividend, does share buybacks, consistently beats earnings, ... It's still up some 16% from my cost basis (I was up 31% a few days back), but I think cheap.\n- BTU is selling off on seaborne thermal prices falling, but... has nothing to do with the thermal prices it has locked in, or with met prices, which are rising. I'm likely not adding more since I already am loaded up (at slightly below today's prices). But if you missed a big earnings report bump, now could be a good time to enter. There will likely be some analyst upgrades coming up soon, and surety/reclamation announcements in the next 45 days\n- PSCE: Small cap energy ETF, trading down with crude. I'm a bit of an oil bull, and this ETF is a bit of a bet on crude oil since small cap US energy firms are more sensitive to its daily fluctuations. It has traded at a huge discount to its larger cap peers in $XLE, for good reason, so far more upside here than in XLE which is still near ATH despite short term crude sell-offs.\n- FCX: Copper has a bright future ahead. This stock is probably closer to fair value than the other stocks listed here. A 3-5 year DCA in my view. Copper undersupply cannot easily change, and I'm not betting on gloomy demand."

     "Why do some of the most influential economists think Fed will err strongly on the side of caution and tolerate 3%-4% inflation?  Why do they think 50bps talk is jawboning rhetoric and not reality?\n\n\n*IMO it has everything to do with the complex sociopolitical climate we live in today.* \n\nAmericans have been fucked with emotionally now for a long time.  They suffered massively from the GFC, a deep and painful recession that they felt were caused by greedy elites and neglectful politicians.  Mainstreet paid the price, not Wall Street.  Obviously the reality is more complicated but that's the perception.\n\nThen came Covid.  The powers at be rightfully told us all to lockdown and we listened.  It was depressing and soul-crushing but it needed to be done and most us responsible people were careful, despite many deniers, anti-vaxxers and loonies not listening.\n\nNow Fed wants to crash the economy for the long-term health of the economy, sure sounds reasonable.  But again regular people pay the short-term price?  Hellll naww.  **We can't handle another crisis, we have reached the limit of crisis fatigue**.\n\nThis is why even though the economy is actually super strong, tons of signs of underlying health and promise, ridiculous liquidity in the banking system, sentiment is at all-time lows.  Imagine telling people before this era unemployment would be near 60 year lows 3.4% and people are this gloomy.\n\nAnd this is why Fed will jawbone 50 bps like they have been, they're going to use rhetoric to its maximum.  But push comes to shove they're going to protect jobs, at least for the foreseeable future.  How will they deal with debt in the system?  By letting it inflate away.  Someone has to get fucked, this time around it's credit markets and bond investors.\n\nAs Harvard economist Rogoff has said:\n\n>I don't think we're going to have a soft-landing by the way.  I think we're going to have a soft, but not the landing.  They're [the Fed] going to allow inflation to be elevated for longer, but they're going to *say it's going to get back to 2%,* we're just taking longer.  **That's going to be the rhetoric.**\n\nAnd this is why you stay fully invested and BTFD.  Debt is trash, cash is trash.  Puts are NOT *Da Wae.*\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk."

But AAPL doesn't need to. \n\nIMO, I'd rather see you buy 1 share of GOOGL (get the class A stock) @ $2317, then 9 shares of AAPL at a total of around $1150 and maybe 5 shares of HON to help balance you out a bit more \n\nBut again, my humble opinion."

I opened a brokerage account (not IRA) on Fidelity after switching from RH and plan on either doing: 100 in SPY, VOO, AAPL, and AMZN or just 200 in SPY and VOO. Then eventually try and hold in the money SPY calls 6 months to a year out once I build more capital. \\n\\nIm also aware that Im young, inexperienced, and dont really have anyone to go to with investing experience.

They have massive rigs that can drill in Bering sea and other dangerous places. They also have a proprietary AI technology that monitors the whole operation and keeps rig down time to an industry minimum.\n\nTIPT insurance company that serves underserved segments of insurance markets (like weird stuff).

Holding both for the foreseable future.  I've owned AAPL for a while and it's gone a little sideways in the past 6 months.  It's my personal feeling though the numbers will be strong again for the next few quarters when they get their stores open fully and when the stimulus money arrives.  I think Apple does well for those 2 events.  Then I'll look at selling 10-20% of my shares.  If they turn in another dream Q like they just had and still go south, that may be sentiment, not execution.  Guy on CNBC talked about (I believe) Microsoft looking to possibly buy PINS.  He said they'll have to pay a LOT more than they originally thought.  I have no idea if that is already in the price.  It's very near an all time high, maybe on a big dip.  I recommend doing some DD into them being bought."

The stock did hit the 225 price after a year so chances are your money is going to be tied up for a year or so until you break even. My advice is if you don't mind waiting a year or 2 then do nothing, but get more seed cash to invest in other stocks or take your loss if it's a comfortable price you're willing to give up & invest in another stock as you surely recover from your loss quicker than holding AAPL depending on ypur experiece trading & investing."

Alphabet hasn't been in any rush with AI because they know how complicated it is and they want to do it right. When they saw the release of ChatGPT and then Microsoft do their thing, they mistakenly rushed something out to show they're working on it too. It was more of a PR blunder than anything else. What they should have done was taken the high road by explaining the flaws in other companies' products, why it is such a complicated technology, and reassure their investors that what they eventually reveal will blow their minds."

     "\"Apple can just create their own search engine\" which they could do... if they could.  It's just like how Apple Maps is just nowhere near as good as Google Maps or even Bing Maps.  Apple was forced to bend over and allow Google Maps back on their devices.\n\nWith Search AI these search engines are going to get so complicated that Apple won't be able to just replicate it, they'll be forced to sign on.  There's really only two underlying search engines in the world.  Google makes one, Bing makes one.  Every other engine is based on either one.  Google represents a little over 90% of all searches.  So they're not going to get beat by better technology at this point.  In order for Chrome to become the most popular browser it required the US government to force Microsoft to give them their data and to not compete.\n\nI think BardAI's presentation not going well is going to mean Google isn't going to be able to \"defend\" against this.  The fact that BardAI in their presentation just gave false information is pretty bad.  I think people will be pretty excited to play with ChatGPT on Bing and I think it'll cause some people to permanently convert over to it.  I could see Bing being up to 20% of all searches in the next two years.\n\nI think the big thing with ChatGPT is that it's really really far ahead of the rest.  It's going to be incredibly useful in Microsoft Office (which is a major product for Microsoft).  \n\nI think Apple is honestly hooped.  They haven't really had a successful new product for a while and it'll be a few years of R&D before they'll be able come up with their next big seller."

Their sales of computers have been stagnant for 10 yrs and smartphones have been for 5 yrs.  Moreover, phones are super competitive these days, they're lasting longer and phones have reached diminishing returns in terms of the tech they provide to customers.  \n\nThey're way behind on services.  Moreover, they only focus on customer-facing services (no cloud).  Don't see them challenging, Netflix, Spotify, etc...  \n\nThey better hope wearables or 5G is something people care about, it's their only realistic growth path.  \n\nThat being said, AAPL is a fine company.  Their goal, IMO, was to get a loyal customer base, then extract as much $$$ out of them as possible.  Mission complete.  Growth will only come from a new gadget; something they haven't done since 2007.\n\n__GOOGLE__\n\nGoogle, on the other hand, does everything AAPL does. However, Google's potential is outside of consumer hardware. At their core, they're a digital marketing company.  Which makes sense. Between search and YouTube they have the majority of the eyes on the internet.  \n\nThey also have all our data, i.e the most valuable asset in the world.  Moreover, unlike AAPL, they're actually trying to do something with all these goodies.\n\nDon't neglect Cloud, it's growing and making up more and more revenue a la Amazon and AWS.  \n\nPut simply, GOOG has tremendous growth potential.  They're trying to do many different things with a novel set of assets.  And if all their moonshots fail, they'll still have the eyeballs and data of the internet."

I can't imagine this will change in the foreseeable future. Unbelievable what it has consistently done in the phone, laptop, and headphone markets.\n\nTheir business models are different, and they both dominate in their respective space, so it makes the comparison somewhat of an apples to oranges issue.\n\nIf i had to bet solely on growth between the two, I would choose the company that has not gone up ~120% YTD as this can't possibly be sustainable for Apple. But who knows, maybe they will release iPhone 12 for $4,000 and everyone will buy one because suddenly their unbelievably powerful and well-built iPhone 11 is no longer sufficient."

They also have a good track record with consumer relations, which supports the notion of them maintaining dominance as time passes."

You kinda do that by holding SPY, but it is a pretty small part of your portfolio at this point.\n\nObviously you like tech, and so do I.

You are young so build your portfolio and if you need to sell one stock over another do it but not because the stock is a short term loser. Think long term, example will VZ survive long term?

In my opinion, AAPL has a bright future with its innovative culture, 5G phones, apple watch products and Apple TV. Where do you see AAPL in the future?

     "As someone who works in the tech industry, I\u2019d invest in Apple every time. It\u2019s a bit more expensive relative to some other popular picks, but it\u2019s a great stock to own. You can never go wrong owning shares in a company that is becoming a utilities company for a society becoming reliant on a mobile OS to deliver goods, services, and social engagement products. I think people still view Apple as a consumer products company.. and although that\u2019s their superpower now, that isn\u2019t their ambition long term. \n\nThere\u2019s way more compute in your pocket than ever before, and the key for the next generation is more specific, context aware devices/capability that report back to a centralized OS. Apple is sitting on a goldmine of data that has yet to be utilized via on device processing. The end result is their native products become custom tailored to the end user, and with the ARM/macOS catalyst apps, it becomes much easier to propagate this data cross platform to serve more people in more places.\n\nThere are clues of this everywhere if you look closely on how they\u2019re thinking about this. It\u2019s not just about services from a traditional subscription lens, but relevancy of data from multiple integrated sources (ie, CarPlay, Maps, watchOS, Apple Card) that can provide a more complete picture on exactly what your habits are on a more granular level (not just cookies) to serve you better and monetize better. You no longer have to be scrolling and tapping a screen to register your intent. It just learns as you go about your day in this new world of iOS.\n\nYou can start to see some of this in iOS already in subtle ways.. for example, the category color in Maps are in sync with your spend categories in Card, which suggests that there\u2019s a system to this madness that hasn\u2019t come to fruition. \n\nRevenue is always a lagging indicator of success in tech. I\u2019ve seen people be skeptical about Apple since I started following them in 2004. Most people understand the importance of services at face value but I don\u2019t think they understand just how much more runway there is to go. Their cash cow has grown up, but they\u2019ve given developers the raw materials to grow the ecosystem.. a lot of these flowers have yet to bloom."

But I'm considering ditching it and replacing it with an ETF that holds it.  \n\nI have little faith in any company that makes phones to do anything innovative enough to break out or go crazy any time soon.  \n\nStill using an iPhone 7 I bought in I think 2015.

Their phones are repetitive small upgrades every year and this also relates to most of their other products and they are also spreading themselves thin, eventually brand name alone wont save them anymore and people wont buy their products. One of my professors mentioned that a company will die when their product range (not sure if this is the correct term) is passed the point of being innovative. They have no where else to go in my opinion besides upgrading the same old thing and latching onto the next big thing like wireless headphones right now. This is the view of an inexperienced trader and college student, I know I have much to learn, i just dont feel like the very small amount of money I do have would be best invested mainly into aapl, rather than a bunch of other companies that I find have more room for growth and are making waves with competition or are just reliable in the long run."

I think other companies you list like TSLA, SHOP, GOOG, & FB all have much more obvious prospects for massive growth then Apple.\n\n* AAPL's reliance on a single part of their business (iPhones) makes the risk of a collapse in value overtime more likely than other big tech companies, most of whom tend to be more diversified.

I think Apple is a great company but I certainly wouldnt want anything to be 40% of my portfolio as a long term investment. Honestly, I would probably sell 75-90% and bring it down to 5-10% of my portfolio. I would also sell off my higher priced shares if I was gong to sell instead of letting the computer pick and default to first-in first out, likely selling off my lower priced shares. I would sell a portion, take some profits, keep my lowest cost shares long term and either reinvest and diversify or short term hold some cash until I had a plan for what to do with the money long term. I think things are going to be volitile into the end of the year with the election, the massive run up we've had since march and the economy. Holding some cash near term would let you buy into some good deals if any pop up.\n\n\nI gambled and dumped 60% of my portfolio into Tesla after the split was announced and theyd run up like 600% in a year (from 200ish to the 1400s)\n\nI cashed out all 150 shares, then later bought back 25.

Not saying they cant increase revenue, just not enough to warrant their PE being double the all time average.\n\nApple is a great company and I have nothing against holding them long term, but holding 40% right now seems very risky given its current valuation.  How comfortable/uncomfortable are you with them dropping 50%?  Dont think this will happen but it could happen.  I think its a good time to cut back and diversify a bit given how far theyve run in recent months. \n\nThis also depends in how much you have in Apple.  If its a few thousand and you wanna let it ride, then go for it.  If its 40k then I would more strongly suggest diversifying."

They should set up merchandising and make a serious bid into gaming.  I think it would be cool if Netflix had a tv remote that could turn into a gaming controller.  The games don't have to be complicated - simple indie games so that parents can pass the buck and raise their kids on Nflx.  \n\nThey are also the only steaming service that actually makes money - indicating streaming is hard and maybe making it a good moat."

There is a major catalyst coming up in the next few weeks which could see huge upside (debt covenants getting released --> shareholder returns). And downside if management does something stupid.\n\nI had also bought AMR (met coal) recently and am already up some 12% so reluctant to keep on adding. Coal Twitter seems to be taking profits on AMR although noting it is still relatively cheap.\n\nI'll make a post about coal, but basically the bull thesis for the next few years isn't that prices are going to be absurdly high like earlier this year, but that the 'new low' is a lot higher. If you look at forward curves for thermal or met coal pricing into 2023/2024, they are still very high. Given that these coal companies are priced cheaply even at those prices, they are a pretty good deal, although not the multi-baggers they once were.\n\nAs a side note, hang out on Twitter and check out the Spaces. You can get some fantastic DD from people in the industry or major investors talking about their bull or bear cases. For example, yesterday I was listening to a guy in Australia talking about the shortages of coal thanks to floods."

I am a young lad who's getting a grip on his finances. I've decided to start investing, but my young age has me, well, inexperienced. I was planning on opening an brokerage account when I turned 18, but covid had majorly impacted my financial situation from what I had foreseen it to be. So, half a year later, here I am, motivated to start by the GME short squeeze. Having taken a (shortened) semester in highschool where I learned a little about stocks and investments, I've decided that since I'm young and not financially independent to invest in stocks I have a strong feeling are going to grow continually over the years. One of my first thoughts was Amazon, and so with the $20 I had before getting a job I invested about $10 of it into Amazon. \\nThat investment has since flopped, because as soon as I made the investment, Bezos decided to step down as CEO.\"",

     "I'm an AMZN holder, and I believe Jassy will be a good CEO (maybe better than Bezos, since Jassy made the only profitable part of the company). One possibility to consider is that Bezos is leaving because he wants to work on other projects. For those projects, he'll need lots and lots of money. Where is his money? AMZN stock. So he might be selling his shares, thus depressing the price. Bill Gates did the same thing when he left MSFT, and ended up with fewer shares than Steve Ballmer. \n\nIt's natural for AMZN to be horizontal for a while--it had an enormous run-up in 2020, then the news of Bezos leaving, and now a broad market sell-off due to treasury yield fears (which hurts growth companies like AMZN in particular). Personally, I think AMZN is amazingly undervalued right now."

     "Worked at AWS for five years and sat in meetings with Jassy. Jeff wouldn\u2019t of given him the company reigns if he wasn\u2019t certain he could do it. Jassy is brilliant and can do the job, his style is a little different than Jeff\u2019s but I don\u2019t think outsiders know how pervasive Amazon culture is steeped in the company. There will be a steep learning curve and will take him a few years to learn the rest of the business but he will have Jeff looking over his shoulder. \n\nThe recent dip has very little to do with the CEO change and more has to do with the macro environment. There is some belief that AMZN will dip as we reopen the economy. They\u2019re also tied up in some of the high growth tech stock rotation.\n\nAmazon is a tricky one to value. It is one of the few stocks I don\u2019t like to use a PE for just because there isn\u2019t a great historical value and it is a slow and steady come-down over decades. They also are unstable in how much they reinvest back into the company, basically if they see something to their liking they give zero fucks about pouring money into it.\n\nI like price to free cash flow instead which tends to range from 40-80. Right now it is at 54 which isn\u2019t terrible but isn\u2019t a steal either. That said, the great thing about Amazon is it is growing so fast so if the price stays constant you\u2019ll be in the 40\u2019s by the end of the year.\n\nI would buy but would not be surprised with a 30% hit if it gets thrown out with the bath water if there is a QQQ crash. Long term this is a decade buy and hold stock. One of only three I subscribe that to: BAM, BRK, AMZN."

Why is Apple at ~$135 a stock when other big retail companies like their biggest competitor Samsung are WAY higher. Even google is 10x higher. Does it have to do with number of stocks available? Or the fact they just launched new tech (M1 chip) last year and likely wont have a big release soon?

     "Just a heads up, but we generally don't need background on things like GME before talking about a totally unrelated topic.   \n\n>Why is Apple at ~$135 a stock when other big retail companies like their biggest competitor Samsung are WAY higher.\n\nStock price is mostly just reflection of the number of shares outstanding and the value of the company.   Let's say you have a company worth  $100, and there are 100 shares.   Each share should be worth a dollar.   Let's say that company does a 1 to 2 stock split.   Now the company consist of 200 shares, and each share is worth 50 cents.  \n\nIn that example the value of the company never changed, only the share price.   This is why comparing the cost of the share of different companies is rather pointless.   \n\nStock splits are exactly why Apple's shares are $135 and not some outrageously higher number.   They've split the stock several times over the years, and recently within the past year."

     "Get them something relevant to their lives, and that pays a dividend. Assuming this isn't a full blown portfolio geared to paying for college or whatever, and more just introducing them to the concepts of investing. It's much easier for kids to grasp the idea of getting paid to own parts of companies. And they can see tangible, albeit small, returns quarter over quarter, which will help reinforce the idea of long term compounding. Focusing on pure growth may be a great way to discourage them as they enter this potential recession and see constant declines QoQ, YoY. \n\nAs they mature, they can explore ideas of growth, reading income statements, sector analysis, small cap vs large cap, foreign and emerging markets, and everything that goes with that. But start with the absolute bare basics and build from there."

Nothing you feel strongly about either way.  Then 30 years later you realize you get a whole bunch of adv. from having that equity in the house.\n\nMaking investing fun makes it feel like a game.  That is how you have the culture of these Reddit forums and why so many TBH SUCK at investing and end up poor in their 50-60's.  \n\nIf you have read the Tortoise and the Hare investing is akin to being the Tortoise.  NO ONE wants to be the tortoise, but that is what you want to be....\n\nFocus on:  Saving, LBYM, not being materialistic, not caring what others have/ wearing, working hard to buy stuff on your own, getting a great education.  Then when they are older... index investing EACH and every month in an asset allocation that makes sense to them.  \n\nThey LITERALLY don't even need to understand anything about what a stock even mean to be worth millions in their 50's if they just do the above.  Or they could do LOVE stocks and be poor in their 50's.  Funny how that works."

Dividends are a plus but not necessary for every stock or company. then, pick a handful of stocks from different sectors and go from there."

They are also at a disadvantage to Nvidia, who just purchased Arm Holdings. NVidia looks to win no matter who emerges as the primary competitor to Apple's newest and upcoming Macs.
