(Something tells me a Gen1 Vision Pro won't be worth much in 67 years...)\n\nIn any case, the house was built in 1956 so if we assume that's the ad year, $7450 then is worth between $83k and $220k in present money^[\\(1\\)](https://www.measuringworth.com/dollarvaluetoday/?amount=7450&from=1956) . \n\nAs a curiosity, this house **was in fact** most recently sold for $83k.... albeit 35 years ago.\n\nOf course in 1956 the gold window was open and $7450 was equivalent to 212.85ozt of gold which today would be worth ~$417k which is much closer to the $517k-$556k estimated range from a few online sources, especially given that the home hasn't sold in 35 years, the online calculators are deeply flawed to the upside, and that they are trailing indicators besides."

Stop Loss = $184\\n\\nI won't explain my work specifically. It's rooted in linear regression and a one time framing which is a pit trading term. I doubt many here know what any of that is.\\n\\nBasically one time framing is a liquidity driven phenomenon as old as 1870s so ... 150+ year track record. It's defined loosely as ever bar (frame) closes higher than previously, no more than two bars close same price or lower. When it closes same price or lower it half backs.\\n\\nThe linear regression confirms this half back as the daily linear regression is the bottom slanted green arrow. The price is in alignment with the 200day.\\n\\nThe confluences are too great to ignore.\\n\\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/e6EE6F4I/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/e6EE6F4I/)\"",

     "Price = Short-term\n\nValue = Long-term\n\nApple is not really overpriced, but it is on the very high end of fair valuation right now. Just look at P/E  or P/S. Or even forward P/E. For P/E, Apple is trading at the very high end of where it was trading pre-covid. P/S is a bit higher than pre-covid but that's fair due to higher margins as they've shifted to services.\n\nAn asset can be priced however a buyer/seller want to price it. But over the long-term, price eventually intersects with value. The question is, can the high prices hold out long enough for the underlying valuation and earnings to catch-up? With the fed increasing rates, my guess is no. Interest rates are increasing too quickly.\n\nPre covid, Apple was trading at a max P/S of 5.5x, and a max P/E of 25x. They are right around 25x P/E right now, so they're within range of fair value. Rates are increasing though and in the last QT period leading up to 2018/2019 pivot, apple was closer to 20x. So it stands to reason that sometime during this QT period, Apple's P/E will drop to 20x. Based on trailing earnings, this would be a price per share of $120 which is a 21% decline from current prices.\n\nThere's no telling how quickly this correction to the multiple will occur though. If earnings can catch up before multiple reality sets in, the price will not actually drop.\n\nForward estimate earnings for APPL is about $6.45/share. Using the 20x multiple and that earnings estimate gets you to $129/share. This is still a 16% drop from current levels. So my guess is that Apple's price is coming down to at least $129 within the next 6-12 months."

Apple stock is more than 50% overvalued at the moment. \\n\\nFull analysis: [https://youtu.be/ZJzdRS9nZ6M](https://youtu.be/ZJzdRS9nZ6M) \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAssumptions: \\n\\n* FCF margins to expand to 30% throughout the next 10 years\\n* 6.3% CAGR in FCF for the next 10 years\\n* P/FCF multiple of 14.6 in 2031\\n* WACC: 11.8%\\n\\nApple is a stable slow growing company that will deliver consistent mid-to-high single digit growth in free cash flow in the years to come. In spite of this, it is trading at sky-high free cash flow multiples close to 30. I do not undertand how these valuations are justified, given that the present value of its future free cash flow does not exceed the 78$ per share. \\n\\nI would like to hear your input on whether you belive that it can trade at the such high multiples in  the years to come, or whether you think that it will far exceed analysts'\"",

     "You're missing very important variables in your analysis - too many to mention in a short response. The EPS and FCF will grow much faster than the revenue will due to services segment alone (antitrust pending.)\n\nInstead, let's say AAPL was $78 per share, like you think it should be. That would put AAPL's market cap at, what, 1.2 Trillion? They spend nearly $100 billion per year on buybacks, and growing. They'd buy back the entire company if it ever got that low again. AAPL is my one holding that I actually get excited for dips, because it means Luca can buy back more. The only way AAPL will ever get that low is if 1) China geopolitical issues/war 2) Antitrust wipes their service revenue off the face of the earth."

If you do, it's fine, it just means you wanted more weight in this or that title. In the end, the biggest allocation should still be the S&P500. \n\nI personally believe in more diversification than this on the long term, like international (also emerging markets to a lesser extent). I don't have any ticker to recommend since I buy pretty much everything in CAN$, but an ETF holding the whole world excluding the US would be a good diversification. It also tends to give more dividends than the US market. People tend to say to just invest in the US because of the higher return, but there's a lot of studies on bogleheads showing that adding some international helps the risk reward curve and can even provide a higher total return during flat periods. Between 5 and 20%.Emerging around 5%, no more than 10%.\n\nYour tech heavy, and concentrated in Google, Apple, etc... I prefer to buy the Nasdaq100.\n\nI also like to increase my exposure to real estate. Avoid ETFs with commercial right now. I don't mind paying fees for active management in real estate.\n\nThey say to always have some gold, either billions or an ETF if gold producers."

It used to be said that 30-40 equities were enough to replicate but I'm not sure any more. \n\nThis is a reason why beating broad market baskets over long periods is difficult---if you miss the rare extraordinary company, you miss a reasonable fraction of total return.  That's easy to do in an active management portfolio because there isn't enough effort possible to deeply study too many equities.\n\nIt also means a small number of portfolios will occasionally have amazing returns if they did include the positive outliers.\n\nThis is consistent with the notion that post industrial revolution, economic gains are made by technological shifts whose benefits are often concentrated in a few companies.  In earlier times, economic gains were a product of broad deployment of capital using well known and non-proprietary technologies, so returns might not have been so dispersed.  Those easy gains, e.g. from electrification of formerly manual industries, have been achieved already."

     "Any fool investing in MCD's now deserves what is coming.\r  \n\r  \nI stopped at two of them three Sundays ago to try to order three egg biscuits for breakfast.\r  \n\r  \nSat in the first one's drive through line for seven minutes, then at the speaker for five - nobody was taking orders. I drove around and waited at for the car ahead of me to get its change (that took a LONG time). Most people kept leaving the line to give up on it, but I got to the window and ordered. Except that I didn't ... \"we don't have egg biscuits\" is what I was told. What he meant was that there wasn't a button for that, or that he couldn't find one - so he was just going to charge me for bacon egg and cheese biscuits and then throw away the bacon and cheese, but of course charge me $13.XX for the privilege. He even checked with the manager, and that was the best they could come up with for one of the most common items they sell.\r  \n\r  \nSo I left, and made it to another McD's before breakfast ended. This time I walked in. I was NOT ready for what I walked in to, though. Eight of the most unhappy people - who had already ordered - were waiting for their food. Then I looked around me; the tables that had people in them ALSO had no food.\r  \n\r  \nThe service and quality of McD's has dropped off like a rock into a lake. I wasted 45 minutes across two McD's and ended up with no food to show for it.\r  \n\r  \nMcD's has to be losing clients left and right. Nobody in their right mind would wait 20 minutes for McD's food AFTER having had to wait 10 minutes, or more, to order it.\r  \n\r  \nMcD's old promise of \"If you don't get your order in five minutes or less, your order is free\" promise is gone."

     "The stock market is a marketplace where publicly traded companies' stocks are bought and sold. When a company wants to raise money, it can do so by issuing stocks, which are shares of ownership in the company. Investors can then buy these stocks, becoming part owners of the company. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand in the market, with the price rising as more people want to buy the stock and falling as more people want to sell. The stock market can be a good way for companies to raise money and for investors to make money, but it also involves risk as the value of stocks can fluctuate widely.

The stock goes down $5 as you thought and then stays there and your put expires worthless because everyone thought the same thing which is why the puts were worth $5 in the f\\\\*\\\\*king first place. You paid $5 for no protection and raised your cost basis by $5.\\n\\nDo this enough times and you end up breaking even at best meaning you just held your stock to the bottom anyway, and at worst you ended up paying MORE for the pleasure of losing money.\\n\\nI make about 50 trades a month so ...

Completly different use cases. Google has had insane growth rates over the years, and even if its going to slow down a bit its not going to stop anytime soon because of chatGPT. If anything, ChatGPT will just boost MSFT when they integrate it to office and azure. \n\nAMZN: behemoth currently valued below 1T, which in reality should be the valuation of AWS alone. They are catching up and surpassing competitors in so many categories: distribution, advertising, entertainment etc. \n\nIm really hoping for a bigger market crash so i can go in hard, but just in case it doesn\u2019t come i have started averaging in both these companies"

  "Text": "b'Apple is cutting Tim Cooks compensation by over 40% to $49 million in 2023. This $49 million pay consists of $3 million base salary, $6 million bonus, and $40 million stock awards. Within that $40 million stock awards, $30 million will be dependent on AAPL share performance. If AAPL share hits performance thresholds, the $30 million will be doubled to at least $60 million. Therefore, in the best scenario, Cook could get over $79 million pay in 2023.\\n\\nDespite the poor performance of AAPL, the compensation Cook received in 2022 was $99.4 million which includes $3 million base salary and over $83 million stock awards and bonus. The pay in 2022 was higher than the $98.7 million pay in 2021.\\n\\nComparing with other executives, Cooks compensation is way higher. CFO Luca Maestri, General Counsel Kate Adams, retail chief Deidre OBrien and COO Jeff Williams are all paid about $27 million total in 2022.\\n\\nThis is incredible, why Cook could get such a high pay even after AAPL sucked for the whole'",

This comes ahead of a 4-for-1 stock split that will lower the entry barrier for prospective investors to buy shares. The iPhone maker has beaten the other tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft to reach this milestone. Of course, this is a largely symbolic figure. Theres nothing significant changing fundamentally. But the bottom line is that Apple is doing very, very well. Maybe you are like many other investors who are contemplating whether to [buy AAPL stock now](https://stockmarket.com/featured/apple-heres-how-it-could-impact-your-investments-2020-08-13). Lets take a closer look at whats ahead for the iPhone maker and why the growth is here to stay.\\n\\n## Ongoing Transition To 5G Network To Give AAPL Stock A Boost\\n\\nOne of the key drivers in Apple stock growth would be the next-generatio'",

     "I honestly think AAPL still has room to grow. Outside of the psychology of purchasing a split stock before and after, the technology sector is an ever evolving one and along with biotech has a large room for future growth. \n\nAAPL cut Intel from making their chips which means they are developing chips made specifically for AAPL products which means save in costs from R&D as well as avoiding outside hurdles. AAPL is its own ecosystem already and to further make themselves self sufficient is good in my eyes. \n\nTech bubble may pop, but I feel it\u2019s also detrimental to sit on the sidelines. You don\u2019t lose money until you sell and APPL is a blue chip company that I can only see recovering and pushing for better products."

     "The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn\u2019t fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don\u2019t realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.  \n     This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out."

     "Potentials for loosing (Edit: losing) their edge over the coming years:\n\n- They don't seem to be on top of the voice assistant game to the same extent as google is, or alexa, and theres google home too which is superior to apples equivalent. This home assistant box is still kind of taking off so it may become a massively missed market for them if the others keep outpacing them. Google home becoming popular could get more switches to android for better integration, becoming a bigger pull away from the apple ecosystem.\n\n- Competitors phones are getting as sleek as the iPhone, and some are managing under screen fingerprint recognition etc. that apple hasn't managed yet. They are catching up to apples design edge. They aren't quite there yet but the gap is closing.\n\n- If apple keep up the higher phone price but still make new phones at the same regularity will people keep upgrading as frequently? I've heard lots of 'the X is a big upgrade, but I cant do this every two years'. "

I don\u2019t think they are doing that great of a job on the latter, and there is a lot of competition and threats out there to consider. If you want a \u201csafer\u201d bet, I\u2019d avoid tech altogether and go with something \u201cboring\u201d like JNJ or XOM."

We were debating if Berkshire was the safest stock investment and got into a discussion if it would be better to just purchase brk.b or all of its holdings individually.  We started going through the individual holdings and settled on Apple as the right balance of safety with likelihood of growth. So I wouldn't say it's safe but the risk reward seems good right now for the reasons you mention."

     "Other commenters keep talking about AAPL\u2019s core product, iPhone, like it needs to be feature filled and innovative. The truth is, iPhone has never really been the most innovative or feature packed phone. People have their own reasons for buying it, but nothing that has happened in the past 2 years from a functionality standpoint have negatively impacted most of those reasons. iPhone sells because of marketing, and marketing functions because of cash, and AAPL has enough cash.\n\nThis is the core business - cost leadership through cheaper manufacturing costs. Leveraging the volume of iPhone sales to manufacturers allows the iPhone business to keep sourcing costs very low, and margins very high. iPhone has, since its inception, had the highest profit margin per device than any other mobile device on the market.\n\nHowever, the iPhone business is plateauing - most people who want an iPhone have an iPhone.  Sell a great phone this year, you take away from next year\u2019s sales. The opportunity cost in the next 10 years of selling an incremental amount of iPhones for x ROI is greater, because emerging technologies force Apple to expand the business via supporting rods through their existing products. Apple made similar decisions in the past few years with some results better than others - Watch is growing along with its margins, but TV\u2019s value exists mostly in tandem with other products. CarPlay is doing ok, but has a really long payback period - the car business simply can\u2019t sustain Apple\u2019s preferred margin level. \n\nOver the next 5-10 years Apple will have to prove to investors that it can win at emerging technologies in the same way as iPhone and Apple Watch. \n\nIn other words, no single stock is safe. If you want a safe investment, diversify. If you like tech, take a look at SHOP, AYX, SQ, Talend, NVDA, AMZN. Most of those have had better 3-year growth than Apple, and also are benefitting from emerging markets."

     "Wow this thread is full of opinions and feelings about AAPL\n\nRe: Apple performance\n\nGrowth for AAPL doesn\u2019t look like increasing market share, which has slowed and most likely isn\u2019t in the cards with their current product mix.\n\nGrowth for Apple comes from monetization within their ecosystem. ASP is up, wearables including Beats and AirPods make up an interesting revenue source. Apple Music, and other service account for more and more of Apple\u2019s revenue growth. With an install base of 1.2B users there\u2019s a real market to focus on revenue expansion. They have a very enviable user base.\n\nRe: Apple as a safe investment\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the safest investment out there. Amongst other reasons: their huge market cap, China/trade issues, possible tech correction. Also compared to a balanced portfolio or strategy which would encompass different risk factors, it\u2019s clearly more risky to be 100% anything.\n\nIn a more short term outlook I like AAPL as a stock, and it\u2019s a very safe investment. Today, it has strong institutional backing, strong dividends, cash on hand, stable and competent leadership, strong brand reputation and a walled garden.\n\nUltimately, any investment must be monitored and adjusted based on market factors. But you guys know that.\n\nTl:dr Apple\u2019s business is very strong. This question is dumb?\n\n"

     "My opinion is hard disagree.  I haven't seen truly bearish sentiment at all.  People who have been investing for a few years can't recognize bearishness, they seem to think anything slightly negative but true is a \"bearish talking point\" or \"doomsday conspiracy theories.\"  People cherry pick parts of earnings calls and Jerome speeches and ignore anything slightly negative.  People are complaining out one side of their mouth about not being able to afford life despite having a good job then out the other side screech at anyone who hints a recession is coming is a conspiracy theorist.\n\nI have a watch list of close to 200 stocks and none are undervalued right now.  That is almost unprecedented. During \"normal\" times, a random amount, maybe 10-20% will be in a dip for either no reason or for a made up reason (such as articles that Amazon will enter so and so industry). That's how I made money.  I would think, is there a reason this good company is cheap, not find one, buy it, and it would go up in 6 months.  Now, every darn this is overpriced. Boomer dividend low growth stocks. Tech stocks. Old falling apart used cars in the middle of nowhere.  Dumpy houses in the middle of nowhere in need of expensive repairs.  The economic situation is actually worse in 2008 in the sense that then, broke people bought houses they had no business buying. Now 6-figure earners are struggling to afford basics.\n\nI'm also seeing loads of \"Q4 earnings was bad but we're raising or keeping high guidance\" comments in earnings calls which has me scratching my head.  Do people actually believe all of this? And I'm also never lived through so much skewing of earnings calls.  Like, the market and investors used to just take lower earnings and bad guidance at face value. I also really wish people grasped the \"just because someone beat expectations doesn't mean earnings are up\" concept.\n\nBear markets end when people who buy \"real\" companies (not bankrupt companies, not 20 year old tech companies with PEs of 200) get scared and stop buying the freaking dip for two seconds.  I'm watching all of these stocks and the market won't let them drop more than a few percent points. This used to only happen in roaring bull markets."

     "We have bottomed, for now. Building up bubbles is bullish. Since we hit the bottom savings have gone down for americans but not for the China, which has gone up.\n\nSo what is really happening? A alternating series of kicking it down the road, masking of indications, and mini bubble ruptures.\n\nHowever, dollar milkshake theory and the everything bubble exists. As traders, we shouldn\u2019t be bullish or bearish. Government intervention is not only the reason for the crash but also the reason it doesn\u2019t crash. \n\nEverybody has reason to be bullish or bearish. The market \u201cpriced everything in\u201d is not real. Every bubble is bound to pop eventually so it should go down right? Since it\u2019s forward looking\u2026..Newsflash, it\u2019s forward looking to \u201ca degree\u201d. If JPOW says anything other than 25 bps, the market will react, which isn\u2019t pricing in shit. \n\nEven with 25 bps, the market will probably dip. Just because of the mechanics of strengthening the dollar and the algos selling in reaction. \n\nIf JPOW is dovish, go bullish, if he hawkish, go bearish. Mainly because the economic phenomenon is difficult for anyone to wrap their heads around completely (I\u2019m studying all the time and keep getting conflicting signals). \n\nIt is very likely JPOW will screw this up by either being too hawkish or dovish and will overshoot. Just don\u2019t fight  \u201cTHE MARKETS PERCEPTION OF FED\u201d. JPOW very commonly \u201cspooks\u201d the market, and the market moves in tandem with JPOW, only for them to, at some random point of good news, start fighting the fed and moving in the opposite directions."

APPL isn't a bad price right now and almost surely is a better bet in the long run, but JWN has a lot more upside in the next year or two for that risk you're paying for.\n\nAPPL will be a steady gainer but they def have more room to go down.

     "Honestly, at this point, I feel like they missed their chance and that type of tech is no longer necessary and wouldn\u2019t be the number one choice for me anyway (I\u2019m a T1D). I guess the one advantage it has is that users wouldn\u2019t need to keep paying for sensors or would require insurance or prescriptions which I guess would be good for folks that are borderline diabetic or just want to monitor their blood glucose out of caution but don\u2019t medically need to and so don\u2019t want to be forking out extra money.\n\nI wear a Libre 3 sensor. It\u2019s the size of a nickel and barely noticeable on my upper arm. It\u2019s on me 24/7 (for 2 weeks before needing to be replaced). Doesn\u2019t need to be charged in those two weeks and is continuously sending information to my phone (and i think it can also send the info to your smartwatch). My phone rings if my sugar is too high or too low (which is great for diabetics scared of not waking up by themselves during a hypoglycaemic event in the middle of the night). The \u201cinvasiveness\u201d of it needing to a have a little wire in my skin is not even noticeable (apart from a little pinch that lasts 10 seconds upon application). Of course if it could be even smaller, that would always be nicer but I really can\u2019t complain.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want to rely on an Apple Watch for my glucose monitoring. An Apple Watch needs to be charged regularly. It\u2019s way bulkier than the sensor on my arm. I\u2019d have to wear it all the time (playing sports or sleeping or when showering) to get to the same level of monitoring coverage."

All you have to look at is how many teens use iPhones vs. everything else. They will keep growing."

Other's have said it is done automatically, others say it takes place at the end of the day instead of the morning, and some have said it doesn't do it automatically because the platform is crap - instead you will have to adjust it yourself. \\n\\nIf I was to do this over on my mobile, do I simply just sell my latest lot on Friday's closing price and rebuy a new lot with this morning's price with a 4 to 1 share increase? Right now my day's performance for the stock has plunged by thousands of dollars but it's very obvious that it thinks its share price went from 499 overnight to 126 so it looks like the system isn't updated. \\n\\nAny insight on the above would be greatly appreciated. \\n\\nThanks\"",

If more good than bad news come, realistically it only has a minor potential climb in the near future. \\n\\nLUV is probably somewhere close to bottom. Its been falling steadily for the past month but similar, slightly riskier stocks like DAL have been relatively flat for a while now and LUV will be too as it finds its way to the bottom. Its taken a little longer for LUV to fall because Southwest is a healthier company than Delta, financially. Going forward, if more bad than good news come, LUV wont fall much further.

I have a question about the Apple split stock.\\n\\nI read on the Apple FAQ that on Aug 24th, AAPL share holders will receive a split share of their stock, however those split shares bill be market value until Aug 31st.\\nWouldnt an investor in AAPL sell those split stocks between Aug 24th and Aug 31st to make the most profit?\\n\\nFor example, lets say I own 1 share of AAPL (with pre-split market value of $400), and on Aug 25th I get 4 shares of AAPL (all four being market value, $400). Couldnt you sell those stocks right then and there, then wait to rebuy AAPL when the split appears on the market?'",

I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started \"investing.\" The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  \n\n\nedit: downvoted for being a loser i already know"

     "Whodathunkit? The lone bright green box on today's market map is none other than the fruit itself (AAPL)! ... not too shabby! lol\n\nOne thing is for sure, market volatility is FINALLY back in a big way after months and months of sideways chop!\n\nIt's no secret that this was looooooonnnnnggg overdue! Welcome to September! :)\n\nThat said, we still don't exactly have a decisive trend in either direction yet ... yes we're seeing large moves up and down the past few days but we're still technically contained within the summer range ... can't get too terribly crazy until some important support levels get taken out ... the prior ATH at 2134 was a step in the right direction for the bears but we've been kind of battling that area ... 2100-ish would be another area ... then of course BREXIT lows which I don't know that we quite make it down that far (yet) but that would be a helluva move if we got down there again.\n\nWhatever you think the catalyst is \"this time\" for today's reversal (fed speakers flip flopping hawkish again?) it really doesn't matter ... this market has been absolutely begging for a move in either direction for months now ... so it looks like its finally decided it wants to resolve itself lower for the time being ... and boy is this refreshing to see IMO! Volatility is a traders dream! The sideways choppy range bound market we had been in for nearly 2 months was to put it midly -- horrific!\n\nNothing wrong with some downside action in a bull market ... Until some major levels get taken to the downside the the jury is still out on this pullback that we're seeing ... in other words this is all still innocent until proven guilty so-to-speak ... just cant get too crazy here, but it is potentially the start of something much bigger ... we shall see!\n\nI hope everyone is holding out okay today? :)\n\nHappy turnaround (on the downside this time) Tuesday r/StockMarket! :)\n\nEDIT: And just for the record -- after all that we've seen over the past 3 trading days with the sizeable moves that we've seen -- the S&P is basically FLAT for the week (and yes I realize we're only on day 2 of the week here!). And still only off about 2.8% or thereabouts from ATH just to put some perspective on it lol."

I know very few people that have an iPad alone.\n\nSo Apple needs to come up with something new to drive growth.  We have reached peak smartphones and this means all players in smartphones will now see margins squeezed in the coming years.  I like Apple products.  I have an iPhone, iPad, and MacBook.  In facts I have more than one of each.  That doesn\u2019t mean I think their stock is worth buying right now.\n\nApple\u2019s is supposedly going to go into the video streaming business.

Those prices are competitive after all, the profit margins are going to be lower than normal. Intel subsequently will issue a price cut to catch up and compete. After that AMD stock starts going back to their old ways unless they come out with some sort of GPU dedicated towards the Machine Learning backend market to compete with Nvidia's domination in the space. Would expect some sort of VR announcement in the pipeline for a mid/low tier competitor in the space but won't amount to much on the stock. At least not this year.\n\nOverall buy next 3 months. Hold after that if they don't massively fuck up execution. Needs to be kept an eye on though."

     "You think we can have bull run with no QE and highest rates in 15 years? With most people barely able to afford to keep up with cost of living increase and energy prices likely driving inflation further? \n\nNone of this is possible. The bull run of the past 20 years was created with low rates and free $. We now pay the consequences. There is NO WAY to stop inflation without deep recession as we have to destroy labor market to stop wage inflation. Recession should last through 2024 (just like in Europe ). Housing, coins, all stocks which don\u2019t make $ should crash as people with no jobs will be forced to liquidate. The fed will eventually cut rates due to recession but it\u2019s too late. 2025 we start over and rebuild. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we hit bottom sometime end of next year at around s and p 2700, which would be in line with other bear markets."

     "In response to the first picture, it\u2019s going to take something strange or significant occurring for the S&P to trade 4600 in the next 12-13 months honestly. The closest we got to it making sense was in August where it looked like rates were going to wind up back in the multi-decade downtrend, then the massive jawboning by the Fed started, which caused some major whiplash there (I didn\u2019t expect 4600 to come in a straight line at that point, but in the remote world where it did occur it\u2019d have been near the end of the year or early next).\n\nThe best case is likely 4300 unless the long-end winds up back under 3 and I feel like there\u2019s essentially a 0% chance of this occurring without some bad crap going down, and if the bad crap takes it under, the S&P is not trading 4600 in that scenario.\n\nIf October was it for a few months, I think 4100 can trade again before EoY, but it\u2019s just as likely that October was just like July and the S&P ends up at 3400 or something on December 31st. In a world where we\u2019re at 4100 or at the very least, 3490ish sticks as the low for 2022, I think Q1 next year marks the low.\n\nBut if 3490ish doesn\u2019t stick, the odds of a secular bear get pretty high, so all of the averages double bottom with their COVID lows in the first half of 2023."

     "I actually just went long this last week on the Q's/beat up tech because I believe something similar. I just .don't think the market can crash right now (without a black swan event) because we just have too much liquidity... I also think that rates have topped for the rest of the year before they move higher in '23. Then I believe the Dollar is about to cool off as well and all of this will allow tech room to rally and breath, before it's clear that the recession is actually here and earnings are negative. So I think somewhere in between Q1/Q2 of '23 is when the market actually bottoms. \n\nAs a side note: Markets usually make new highs after yield curve inversions but before the recession hits... So I could see this playing out similarly where we go on a crazy strong rally into EOY... I just don't see new highs... but perhaps the Dow could make a new high, while SPY and Q's underperform... just like what we have seen recently"

     "Great research! Provides some nice  insights onthe current market. \n\nFrom Powell's transcript,  there are still billions of spending awaiting to be injected into the economy. ( Chips act, bipartisan , ) Powell been slow playing the game, easing investors into high rate environment.  Inflation is around 6.6% in September.(this is excluding food and energy data as well, otherwise would be higher) Even if Powell increase rate by 75 basis pts in december, fed rate is still much much too low. \nPowell emphasized again on how firm they are in maintaining 2% inflation. The expectation of rate increase during this round was 4.4% next year, now after this latest update, market is expecting 5+ %. \n\nNotice how they are slowly raising the expectation? \n\nHow does this impact our economy? Aside from what op said about liquid and dealers holding the bag.... All sorts of debts we are seeing.  30 year housing rate is at 7% right now  (highest since 2002) and mortgage application have crashed to the bottom.(lowest since 1997)  This directly translates to housing crisis in the making. (Those who does Airbnb arbitrage will probably suffer the most.). Moreover, the housing sales so far ONLY dropped by 25% comparing to last year.  (This is not even shown on the government's inflation data.) \n\nPowell have been dodging all the serious questions about these impact not being captured on the CPI/PCE data. The housing data they have collects only rent and etc.... Doesn't even touch the housing price. (Supporting data is from Bureau of labor statistics using their shelter index to measure the cost of housing for both renters and the homeowners. \"Focuses on the rent tenant pays and how much the rent equivalent would be if home owner rented a party similar to their own.\"  This is ridiculous method as it would experience huge delay and cannot capture the REAL housing data in real time. .....to put it into perspective, if housing price crashes but not to the point it impacts the rental price, their data will not even acknowledge of the housing crash. \n\nPowell is not done yet. All these cover ups or purposely NOT mentioning/excluding critical data leads me to believe ..... It's still too early to dca into \"value companies.\" There may very well be some fake rallies done by these so called \"dealers\" so they can find bag holders (retail investors) then they'll find positions to take advantage again. \n\nOh right. Midterm election. Lol I dunno if that's not market manipulation , what is.  Anyway, fake rallies, then at least one or two more big drop in the market. \n\nPs Volker back in the days curbed their inflation of like 14% or something by raising rate to 20%. If Powell is so adament on curbing the inflation this time, I'm pretty sure interest rate will have to be much higher than current rate."

Add in the facts that AAPL net profit is $40B more than MSFT and crushes MSFT on almost all financial metrics, it makes me think the market has either priced MSFT too high or AAPL too low at the moment. \\n\\nIve wrote options to have AAPL placed to me at $170 and feeling really good about it. Anyone else playing with me? Against me?\\n\\nEdit: Its been pointed out that MSFT did not actually pass AAPL in market cap as Google Finance indicates. Yahoo finance has the more accurate figures with up to date share counts that has MSFT $26B lower than AAPL. Still, the gap is incredibly tight in my opinion given the very different financial profiles of the two companies. MSFT could easily make the pass next week. '",

     "Doing a lot wrong.\n\nRead my investing bible\n\n1. Buy good companies with strong financial statements.  Companies with low debt, and companies that show a trend of growing and increased net income and revenue. Once you understand how to read a financial statement, you can make 70% of your decision to buy based on the financial statement, even before knowing what the company is.\n \n2. Only buy companies that has a competitive advantage, one that would be had for another company to overtake them.  A company where you can envision that 50 years from now, they will still be relevant.\n \n3. Buy undervalued companies.  There are many companies out there with great financial statements, a trend of growth, but the price must be right.  For example, Amazon shows consistent growth, but at their current price and how much net income they are bringing in and P/E ratio, it will take many decades for them to make enough money to warrant that current price evaluation.\n \n4. You only need a few very good companies to get rich.  People that diversify don\u2019t know what they are doing, so they try to mitigate risk.  But to get wealthy, you go all in only a few stocks that you have thoroughly researched and meets all the criteria stated above.  People that get very rich, they do it off only a few stocks.  You want all your money in a good company where when it moves, it moves in a big way.  Enough to move the needle.\n \n5. Have a strategy, once you know the top 5 companies you are going to invest in, the price fluctuation doesn\u2019t matter as much anymore.  It will go up and down periodically, but each time it goes down, you need to buy more.  Load up as much as you can when the price is low.  You are betting on your research and confidence that 10 years from now this company will grow many folds.  It\u2019s hard to predict in the short term whether a stock going to go up or or down, but I can predict with high certainty that a stock will go up in 10 years.  \n \n6. Stock investing is simple.  If a company is profitable and consistently brings in profit, the stock will grow and so will your money.\n \n7. Ignore the micro / temporary issues in society.  For example, covid, new politician, fear of war, Ukraine invasion etc.  All this does not matter, it\u2019s only temporary. A good company that historically shown to make profits and grow, they will overcome and continue to grow the long run.\n \n8. Do not invest money if you need the money in the short run.  For example you need the money in a week a month or even a year.  Stock investing is long run, most big profits are made in year 6 or higher.  You need to be able to buy and hold for 10 years to see substantial increases.\n \n9. Do not invest in speculative stocks.  Don\u2019t invest in the story, for example \u201cmarijuana stocks\u201d is the future, or electric cars or renewable energy is the future.  Only invest in companies that you can check their financial statement and see they have a trend of growth.  Not saying to invest in well established companies that are profitable, but you need to find a company that you look at the financial statements and pick up a trend of growth.  NIO is an example of a good stock that has shown growth.  Although they are still not in the green on net income yet, they show a trend of increasing revenue each year, closing the gap on the net income to be profitable and each year they are producing more cars and expanding their markets.  \n \n10. Remove the prejudice in your investing strategy.  Don\u2019t be prejudice because you don\u2019t like investing in oil, or because it\u2019s from China you don\u2019t like Chinese people, or you don\u2019t like investing in companies that start with the letter A.  All that does not matter, you are here to make money.   Invest wisely by analyzing the financial statement and where the trajectory of that company is going.\n \n11. Never sell a stock when it\u2019s low.  If you invest in good companies stated above, these companies has always recovered and increase their stock price significantly after the turmoil.  \n \n12. Invest in companies that has room to grow.  Think of stock investing like how many innings in a baseball game.  Ask yourself, where is this company now, is it in the 1st inning or is it in the 9th inning.  For example Amazon, ask yourself where is this company at in it\u2019s life, is this company now fully matured, do they still have room to grow? In my opinion, Amazon is near the full maturity stage, it\u2019s in the 7th inning, there\u2019s not much more room for it to expand or grow.  But Alibaba, is the 2nd biggest competitor to Amazon, and it shows a great financial statement and the trajectory of it to grow is still quite high.  They are consistently getting more active user each year and the market they are in, which is China still has a lot of room to grow.\n \n13. Do not options trade, it\u2019s gambling.  It\u2019s hard to predict a stock going up or down in the short run.  To ensure high probability of success, buy good, undervalued companies and hold long run.\n \n \n \n \n \nWritten by Ethan Lee"

     "I would balance out the big tech stocks.

And it seems like your portfolio is heavy growth so I don\u2019t know if you care much about the dividend yield. \nNot very bullish on Rivian, but also not to read up on them. So I can\u2019t speak to that company as much. But my ignorant perspective is that there are much better, unprofitable risky stocks than Rivian. (Personally I like SOFI at these prices) \n\nWould probably scrap Berkshire too and put that money into some of the big tech or VTI.

He's made a name for himself as one of the best investors of all time, but interestingly his flagship fund BRK-B doesn't even outperform SPY over the past 10 years and barely outperforms since its inception. I'm genuinely curious, why would someone own Berkshire stock instead of the S&P? With AAPL making up 40% of Berkshire, it seems like a massive amount of trust in one company. So you have increased risk with AAPL making up such a big piece of the pie and very little upside advantage, BRK-B doesn't seem like a good trade-off to me. So if you can create a fund that barely beats the S&P over the long term, does that earn you the title of greatest investor of all time? I feel like so much of Berkshire's gain come from them simply announcing that they took a position in XYZ company, which results in an imm\"",

     "Coming off a bit more aggressively from that $160 level here...\n\nRumors swirling around that apparently there is a connectivity issue with the new Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatch.\n\n**Apple admits issues with Apple Watch connectivity, stock falls**\n\n[SOURCE](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-admits-issues-with-apple-watch-connectivity-stock-falls-2017-09-20)\n\n> Apple Inc. AAPL, -2.41% shares declined Wednesday morning after the tech company reportedly admitted there are issues with connectivity of its new Apple Watch Series 3. The new Apple smartwatch is the first to connect to cellular networks on its own, without having to be electronically tethered to an iPhone, but reviewers had issues staying connected while reviewing the new device. According to The Verge, Apple admitted an issue in an official statement, saying, \"We have discovered that when Apple Watch Series 3 joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi networks without connectivity, it may at times prevent the watch from using cellular. We are investigating a fix for a future software release.\" The new Apple Watch, which costs at least $399 for versions with a cellular connection, opened for preorders last Friday and will begin reaching customers Sept. 22. Apple stock fell more than 1% in early trading Wednesday, and is down 0.4% in the past month, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.02% has gained 3.3%.\n\nAAPL is accounting for at least a 30-point drag on the Dow Industrials thus far today.\n\nTo BTFD or not to BTFD that is the question."
