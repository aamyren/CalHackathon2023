  "Text": "b'*Guys*. Pfizer (PFE) is scheduled to report its Q1 2023 results on tomorrow morning and I fully expect to see higher levels, with its revenue and earnings exceeding the consensus estimates. \\n\\nLet\\'s for a second consider the \"pandemic products.\" Their Covid-19 vaccine and the antiviral pill will definitely see a significant drop in sales. The combined revenue from these two products is estimated to be $21.5 billion in 2023, compared to $56.7 billion in 2022. However, if we were to exclude the Covid-19 products, the companys sales of everything else will likely trend higher. Not only do I expect PFE to post upbeat Q1 results, analysts do find that the stock is undervalued-  I\\'ll get into this further. \\n\\n**Covid-19 products down, but who cares?**\\n\\n[Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PFE/no-login-required/D048UezA/Pfizer-PFE-Earnings-Preview-PFE-Stock-Likely-To-Trade-Higher-Due-To-FY-2023Q1-Revenues-And-Earnings-Likely-Beating-Expectations?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230430) est'",

One, there is no way a greedy Exec is gonna allow money to be wasted on a vaccine that MAY be necessary. Two, to guarantee such a plan works, you need to release the virus as well, thats an act of terrorism and yeah if Pfizer is planning a dumbass idea like that, they should get in deep shit.\n\nHonestly just sounds like bs to further put down mRNA technology. mRNA tech for vaccines is better than the traditional inactivated virus because you are dealing with less proteins, so less off-target effects from your immune system. So that's why we use it now. mRNA is also very transient, being cleared by the liver of itself and the lipid nanoparticles that encapsulates it. However, the dude is probably referring to using machine learning yo predict mutations are make libraries ahead of time, no mutations need to be injected into Covid.\n\nI worked with mRNA for 3 years, so I know my shit, more or less.\n\nTLDR: Sounds like misconstrued science, likely referencing machine learning predictions of and not real mutations. mRNA good, typical conspiracy, see yall Monday."

     "From a paper about FDA approval and stock price:\n\n\n\u201cCONCLUDING COMMENTS\nThis research shows a positive correlation between FDA drug approvals and a company\u2019s market share price for instances in which the subject drug is either a new remedy or an improvement above existing remedies available in the marketplace. A \u201cblockbuster\u201d classification is viewed by investors as a growth opportunity for the company. As such, the market responds strongly by increasing that company\u2019s stock price. There is also a favorable correlation between a Priority Review Drug classification and increases to a company\u2019s stock price. However, as expected, a Priority Review Drug approval\u2019s impact on stock price is not as strong as that of the blockbuster drug. Lastly, there was no observable correlation between a FDA approval of a Standard Review Drug classification and the companies\u2019 stock price. The market exhibited neither a positive or negative stock price reaction to those \u201clesser drugs\u201d. These results support the conclusion that FDA approval does indeed affect a pharmaceutical company\u2019s stock price. The differentiating criterion is the classification level of the new drug, and how investors and the market in general perceive the value each respective approval to the recipient company. Drugs representing more significant advancement over existing therapies cause larger\u201d\n\n\nhttp://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/182804.pdf"

It appears rumors might well be true and the Crap has begun to hit the fan. Apparently, In a twist of irony, the govt of Wuhan (where covid started) announced that they would have to make cuts to people's medical benefits (I.E. their equivalent of Medicare) and it has sparked mass protests outside govt buildings.

Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. \\n\\nWhile BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.  BNTX options are also manipulated to shit and I know this from personal experience. \\n\\nAnoth\"",

Now the public has just said through rioting that there are no more fucks to be given bout the 'rona as all fucks are given towards police brutality. \n\nXLV took a dip but was right back up to ATH before one could blink. It out performed everything except recently tech overtook it. \n\nNo more 'rona checks are coming, Fed isn't handing anyone money after the riots and now the news doesn't give a shit about COVID as it's protest/riot coverage 24/7, and come July those extra unemployment checks stop. People will no longer have health coverage nor money to pay for shit. The Fed is now less focused on Corona and the pressure on the FDA to get it done disappears and they go back to their normal, glaciers move faster, speed. \n\nPlus R&D is about to be fucked up for a year as no college labs, now this may improve the budgets as R&D is the biggest expense, but also means nothing in the pipeline to cover the drops when patents expire and their shit becomes generic."

  "Text": "b\"Pfizer has a TON of upside potential. Here are a few different reasons why it could go to the moon.\\n\\n1. As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)). Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!\\n2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works. Therefore, US demand will literally be capped tits high until more of the US population is fully vaccinat\"",

You see, Pfizer will be releasing data on their coronavirus vaccine within the very near future, and as we all know, stocks with COVID treatments skyrocket on even the slightest hint of good news.  Look at GILD, MRNA and NVAX.  You might say that Pfizer is bigger than all three of them so will have less volatility and you would be correct, but GILD has a 93B market cap, so while PFE is twice as big at 187B, if inconclusive data on GILD can send it up 10% plus, think about what positive data on a coronavirus vaccine that will actually hit the public in September will do.  \\n\\nThe best part about this is that PFE options are pricing in extremely low volatility, so they arent even expecting much of a move which is quite surprising given how the market has reacted to coronavirus tr'",

     "Jesus christ you don't know anything about the SGLT2 inhibitors.\nErtugliflozin DID NOT result in a statistically superior cardiovascular benefit. Guess what? All of Pfizer's competitors DO have superiority.\n\nThe reason why you say \"this isn't priced in\" is wrong because you don't understand the data. It is priced in and the stock didn't move as the market didnt expect much from it anyway given its the fourth to market SGLT2 inhibitor.\n\nEdit: please everyone OP is a fucking retard. \"[Pfizer's diabetes drug] will be an oral agent to replace existing injectable options within the class?\" No, all the SGLT2 inhibitors are already oral and have been on the market for years. OP is getting confused with insulin, which the SGLT2 inhibitors aren't competing with. \n\nPlease don't listen to this DD and please don't buy calls thinking every diabetic is going to be on this wonder drug. They're not. At best there is a SGLT2 class effect which ertugliflozin would benefit slightly from, but there's little reason for a doctor to prescribe it over the other class leaders such as empagliflozin."

Very tempted to double down here. If my PCG 9/18 15c ever turn profitable, I will bailout and put the money into PFE, till then, diamond hands. I need to stop playing with energy related stocks, they burn me every single time. \n\nOn a related pharma note, some other WSB autist posted TRVN getting a run up leading to their big FDA review in August. In true WSB fashion, I have taken the advice of this stranger after spending 30 minutes reviewing propaganda articles and Wikipedia. Holding 9/18 2.5c since his post and up 50% right now.

Short answer is that these are excellent results against two far more challenging variants than what PFE/MRNA were evaluated against. NVAX's supply deals will be locked in there will be many more deals coming now that they have Phase 3 data.\n\nTo get a better idea of the efficacy, it's important to subset the data by variant:\n\n1. **95.6% efficacy against the original strain -> i.e. best result to date**\n2. 85.6% against UK strain\n3. 60% efficacy against SA strain in the non-HIV positive cohort\n\nAlso important to note that NVAX included more elderly than any of the other trials to date with 27% of the trial consisting of 65-84. For comparison, Pfizer's trial cutoff at 70.\n\nThe drop-off in efficacy from UK to SA is a big deal for the rest of the world. I will explain more about this in my update."

     "TMC is trash as a stock? Definitely. If it has play potential? One of the very Breakout play before 2022. Buy low, sell high, analysts placed as oversold and a price of 8.9, with momentum and enough greediness, we might, and when I sell we, only if the Ticker gets popular, touch the 10.\nI bought the dip heavily, why? Dead cat bounce and the stock has yet to make the classic bounce to get closer to the IPO Open Price. \nPure technical play. Might be the only non-gamble move I am performing this year, since the others I was beating in fundamentals which is not my niche. Ironnet, had the CEO General, nothing, however if touches anything under 20, yes, bounce play.\nI don't want to pump TMC, it's not a good stock, long term, it's a huge gamble. Short term, as I mean, before December, the Chart is screaming for a breakout and do the hiking to see if its value gets close to the IPO Price. Possible? Definitely, however I think it will be short lived, however loam around the 8-9 consolidated. A buy? Definitely. No short squeeze bs, no gamma. It's a classic good sum up of Dead Cat Bounce + First time being under IPO Price.\nThe Recipe? Tasty. Probabilities if we are talking numbers and chart? Huge. \nIMO, Calls, buy, safe sell is at IPO price open. Feeling greedy, sell a bit past that. Remember, they always do ONE DCB, before falling completely dead. YOLO in Puts during the bounce. Have enough money to fucj around WSB forever and laugh when you lose 100k, but profited 300 a week ago.

     "Wells Fargo is an organization that everyone should avoid like a plague.\n\nI wound up with a Wells Fargo serviced mortgage. Backed by Fannie Mae.\n\nWhen I caught my ex-wife cheating on me just prior to the pandemic, I filed for divorce. She made the most money out of us at that point for the first time in the marriage (hypergamy, yayyy), and so I ran out the numbers and determined that she was the only one of us who could actually afford to keep the property. I verified that she could take an assumption through WF.\n\nInstead of making the mortgage payment, she took her new man toy out on a multiple mortgage-payment-sized vacation, crossing multiple state lines on the onset of the pandemic. She then proceeded to seek out the mortgage forbearance on her own without my knowledge.\n\nThis led to me not even finding out (divorce decree had been signed/accepted, she was the responsible party at this point) that she had done it until the property was already $7500 behind. To top this off, she bought dogs that destroyed the house. They shit on the high dollar carpet. Pissed on everything. Tried digging through the nice carpet, too.\n\nThen the spring rains hit hard (250 year storm). The sewer came out of the basement. I wound up removing all of the carpet and doing chemical spray, then getting the pathetic insurance rider utilized in order to take care of the damage without going over. Got everything repaired. Thankfully, the dogs were gone at this point after murdering one of the family cats.\n\nShe ran the forbearance down to 18 months on the day. I had to go in and clean up the mess and try to get the house ready to sell again. It was ready to sell. But by this point, the equity had been eaten by her lack of payments despite her ability to pay (she had a \\[or near\\] six figure salary with a very, very popular pharma company at this point).\n\nI convinced her to sign the property over to me within the marriage so that I could do a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Still no divorce at this point, fun. After she had moved out, I had handed the property over to Wells Fargo's property preservation department. They changed the locks, so I didn't think I could get into the property anymore. I let it be.\n\nOnly after talking to the neighbor some months later did I find out that *they* had been mowing the lawn. *They* had been having to go over to the house once or twice a day to close the front door because they botched the lock installation and it wasn't latching. They had also been trying to call Wells Fargo (number on the front door) that the door was blowing open, and then that there was water in the basement.\n\nWhen I called Wells Fargo, that department told me \"we can't talk to you because the house is under litigation.\" That's fine. You're the property preservation department. I dunno. Maybe PRESERVE it. So I'm having to fight a giant to convince it to mind its own future assets.\n\nWhoever was going in, late spring found standing water in the basement. The one I had *just fixed* from the prior spring. They never turned the power on. So no sump pump running. They would not listen. I warned them that if they didn't do anything they'd be looking at tens in thousands of damage. It was still *my* property at that point, and they were destroying it while also adding more due each month to the note. To top that off, I had to drive two hours to and from the property to take a picture of the sump pump on the property to prove to them that a house right next to a flood plain *does indeed have a sump pump* because its *required by code*.\n\nFinally, after weeks of screaming, I got a hold of someone who could get a hold of someone to clarify that yes this department could talk to me, allowing me to call them and inform them that YOU FKED UP SON.\n\nMold had climbed up 5 feet by the time they got around to getting someone into the house.\n\nThey called me a couple months later to inform me that the damage had been repaired. No it hadn't. Nothing had been done except removal of the bottom 4 of drywall. In the mean time, I finally won my divorce a few months back.\n\nWells Fargo called and said that the property was worth significantly more and asked if I wanted to put it back on the market. Why would they say this given the damage? Huh.\n\nSo I drove up and took a look at the property. Wow. Slum lords would wince at the quality of work. Even with the great California/NewYork diaspora, I would be hard pressed to sell the property for that amount of money. Paint where there should not be paint. No paint where there should be paint. Drywall over where there used to be venting ducts. Horrible drywall/mudwork. Carpet badly installed. Trim the wrong size, pre-finished, not painted over, gapped badly. Doors in shoddy shape (damaged). Custom shelves destroyed. Lighting fixtures missing. They want to claim its worth 17% more now than when my ex wife and I bought it originally? The property was *gorgeous* when I bought it. Now its hideous. *I* could have done better work, and I *have* done better work, and I'm not a handyman by any stretch. They rushed it.\n\nBut if it had been worth that much, the fact that their malfeasance or ineptitude or stupidity or all of the above had cost me months of potentially having it on the market to sell without having to do a deed in lieu.\n\nWells Fargo is a shit company. They are an unethical company. They do not care about their customers. They care about the almighty dollar and sucking off their shareholders. They are a corrupt company.\n\nThe fact that Wells Fargo is not allowed to grow until the fix their culture problems is not justice to me, nor is 3.7billion in fines. I was robbed of choice. I was robbed of authority on something I had was contractually but not legally responsible for. And then I was told to pound sand on multiple occasions because they couldn't read their own notes.\n\nThe irony is that for the last two years, the only one in my transaction that was apparently working towards Wells Fargo's benefit? Me. At my own detriment. In retrospect, maybe I should have gone and gutted every wall. Broken every window. Its my property after all. Why not? But you see, I couldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Because its not the right thing to do.\n\nI ask how in the world is it that the guy who had no choice in the financial disaster was the only one between me, an ex wife, and a multi-billion dollar organization that was actually trying to take care of the issue? I ask myself daily. \"Why do I bother.\" \"Why do I care.\" They obviously *do not*.\n\nWells Fargo? If they could set the house on fire and still charge me a mortgage on something they burned to the ground they would. They are the worst. They are just. The fucking. Worst.\n\nOn that note. If there's anyone that wants a \"$400,000 property\" that's a 5 bed 3 bath 3 car garage quarter acre lot with gas and electric and good internet home in the midwest, message me. If you want to buy it in cash for the value owed and skip the real estate agents I'm interested in entertaining offers before it goes to foreclosure. Maybe your standards for the basement work are lower than mine since you don't remember what it used to look like. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)\n\nSomething I have found funny is that every time I have mentioned the word \"lawyer\" all of these organizations clam up like a prude on prom night. \"Sir, you cannot make legal threats, if you are going to threaten legal action I will have to hang up right now.\"  \n\n\nHoly shit, you bitch. I literally said \"there's no way I can fight Wells Fargo legally.\" Hell, when the house initially went to the foreclosure firm, I called them up. *THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON.* I wound up reporting to the law firm that would be foreclosing **on me** what was going on and giving them ten times the information that Wells Fargo was giving them. *I was helping them sue me and they still* ***fucked it up.*** \n\nHonestly, if I had money? One I wouldn't be in this situation. But two, I would fight them in court over a dollar on this one. I think my case is precisely what their whole \"you are not allowed to grow as a bank until you fix your culture\" problem is about. They haven't fixed anything. I've done nothing but suffer at their hands, and I know that there's multiple executives who have me on the email chains tied to the property, per someone at their director level.\n\nAlso, if anyone is a lawyer/law firm willing to beat Wells Fargo up in court for free on my behalf to make them feel the pain they've dished out on me for the last 2+ years, get a hold of me ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271). I'd at least like to be paid for the hundreds of hours I've spent being a better employee to them than their execs."

I believe that the Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) partnership has the clear advantage and will likely be able to show efficacy and obtain FDA approval first among its rivals.\\n\\n\\n--\\n\\n**Rationale**\\nIn order to show efficacy, the standard is that at least 30,000 individuals must be enrolled in a phase 3 trial of a vaccine candidate. This already presents a barrier to smaller companies that cannot muster the logistics to organise and carry out such a study. It improves the advantage of larger companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Although Moderna captured early hype and headlines in the USA for promising early stage results, it will likely lag behind larger companies in crossing the finish line for Phase 3 (see google trends graphic linked below).  Pfizer has recently increased its total study to include 44,000 people, making it one of the largest phase 3 studies in the world and increasing the d'",

  "Text": "b'With a forecast 2021 PE of roughly 11, great pharma assets & pipeline, and the continued need for Covid vaccines/boosters, I view Pfizer ($PFE) as undervalued just on current fundamentals. Not to mention theres been a lot of deferred health care by people quarantining at home, so its reasonable for sales to pick up this year. \\n\\nAnd lets not forget that you get paid a 4% dividend to wait for capital appreciation. PFE maintains that the dividend will not be reduced as a result of the initiation of a quarterly dividend by Viatris, Inc., which was spun out of Pfizer last year. \\n\\nOverall, PFE is in an industry that hasnt experienced super high valuations lately. And the fundamentals, growth potential, and  dividend all help to provide a reasonable margin of safety. \\n\\nNOTE: This is not investment advice. Please do your own due diligence. As of the writing of this post, I hold a long position in Pfizer shares.\\n\\nEDIT: Annual Covid booster shots could be a boon to Pfizer. Plus this new tech'",

(Myovant Sciences)\n\nFresh off the back of Myovant Sciences\u2019 first FDA win for relugolix in prostate cancer late last year, the Swiss pharma can now add a second indication to its flagship drug's resume.\n\nThe U.S. FDA on Wednesday approved Myovant\u2019s relugolix in combination with two hormone drugs as the first once-daily treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding linked to uterine fibroids in premenopausal women, with a treatment duration for up to two years. The drug will be marketed as Myfembree.\n\nUterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that develop in the uterus. They're among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women, Myovant says, and can cause serious symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pain, abdominal bloating and, in some cases, infertility.\n\nThey can be treated with birth control to address bleeding and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, which can shrink fibroids. Patients with more severe symptoms may need surgery.\n\nMillions of women in the U.S. are affected by uterine fibroids, which account for over 250,000 hysterectomies each year, Myovant CEO Dave Marek said.\n\nMyovant predicts roughly 19 million women in the U.S. have uterine fibroids, although only a quarter of those women, or about 5 million, will experience symptoms and seek care from a physician, Marek said. About 3 million will fail on first-line treatments, he added. The company's immediate goal will be to target those patients.\n\n\"We are going to need to do education to get (women) to know that there are options for them and that what they're having is not normal, and that there's something to do about it,\" Myovant Chief Medical Officer Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira said in an interview.\n\nRELATED: Myovant leans on new partner Pfizer as it dives into first launch for cancer drug Orgovyx\n\nWednesday's approval marks the second FDA nod for Myovant in less than a year after relugolix scored a go-ahead in prostate cancer in December, sold as Orgovyx. The company is also testing its flagship drug in women with endometriosis, another painful disorder involving the uterus\u2019s tissue, and as a pregnancy prevention medication.\n\nPfizer will help Myovant sell Myfembree for uterine fibroid patients in the U.S. as early as June. The pharma giant doled out $650 million upfront plus sweeteners last year to get a piece of the drug, which launched in prostate cancer patients in early 2021.\n\n\"We are shifting from a development stage company to a commercial stage company,\" Marek told Fierce Pharma. \"A key part of that was finding a partner in Pfizer that has tremendous strength, not only in prostate cancer but also in women's health.\"\n\nBut Myfembree will have to battle against AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences\u2019 already standing Oriahnn (elagolix) for a slice of the uterine fibroid market.\n\nAfter receiving the FDA\u2019s clearance to help treat heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids nearly a year ago, AbbVie's med has a sizable head start. Oriahnn, which is approved for both uterine fibroids and endometriosis, raked in $121 million in U.S. sales for the Illinois pharma in 2020.\n\nFor Myovant's part, it has not provided any forecasts into potential revenues, Marek said. However, Myovant believes physicians will favor the convenience of its once-daily pill versus the twice-daily pill from AbbVie.\n\nA bottle of 28 Myfembree tablets will cost about $975 before rebates, according to an SEC filing.\n\nRELATED: Myovant's uterine fibroid med hits the mark in 2nd phase 3 trial\n\nThe FDA based its Myfembree approval on two replicate phase 3 trials\u2014dubbed LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2\u2014that showed the med significantly beat placebo in preventing blood loss among women with uterine fibroids. Specifically, 72.1% and 71.2% of women in the relugolix arm responded to the treatment compared with 16.8% and 14.7% of women in the placebo groups after 24 weeks, respectively.\n\nIn its approval, the FDA warned the drug shouldn\u2019t be used for longer than 24 months due to risk of continued bone loss that may not be reversible.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with comments from Myovant CEO Dave Marek and CMO Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira."

Both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna\u2019s vaccine uses same mRNA technology. Pfizer indicated it\u2019s still testing what is the OK temperature they can transport without degrading the vaccine. Second, Pfizer will not be able to produce enough vaccine to meet the demand anyway, same with Moderna. Moderna having \u201cbetter\u201d vaccine will not affect Pfizer\u2019s vaccine demand. Pfizer and Moderna both will make money out of this."

     "Great DD, just wanted to add a couple things:\n\n1. The shorts are sitting on a powder keg if the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is granted. Ortex has the current short interest at close to 50% of the free float. Good luck trying to cover that in the event an EUA is granted and the stock goes up over 100%.\n\n2. Even if you take the most pointed criticism from the Culper short report as true, that 7 of patients in the placebo group had very low O2 and were going to die (Culper itself admits this is conjecture assuming a normal distribution), you can remove those 7 patients from the pool and sabizabulin would have still resulted in a 29% relative reduction in mortality rate. EUAs have been granted to COVID drugs for far less than that."

They are doing everything they can to delay or manipulate the approval process,  They are in effect delayig several life saving drugs(Not just VERU) by making the FDA go back and match the submitted data with what is saved on site in person.

This will come down to the committee recommendation I think.  The comments so far(only 7 at moment) are generally in support of minimum conditional approval with reassessment due to the fact that this is a last chance before death option.  They say, correctly in my opinion, that with the safety record through all of the studies in higher doses that it wrong to deny people on the verge of death something that could save their lives.  And if the real world data does not support the conclusions in the study than withdraw the approval.  \r  \n  \nThe price will more likely than not drop down to around $8 I think,  which I will more than likely buy more shares at.

Sell Murphy Oil and Goodyear Tire calls before the closing bell though if you\u2019re in the green. Sell AirBNB and Mercado Libre Puts if you\u2019re in the green before the closing bell. \n\nMercado Libre burned a lot of bears last time, and I would think people would go into the trade feeling bearish considering what happened to AMZN. AirBNB has a chance to resurge provided people are traveling after being cooped up for 2 years. This stock is still overvalued at 90+ billion though, especially in this uncertain fiscal climate.\n\nMurphy Oil is a no brainer; natural resource stocks still have room to run I feel, but you could lose in the short term price action if earnings don\u2019t match up with the upcoming demand we\u2019ll probably have for crude. I\u2019ll buy shares if earnings results into a bloodbath. Goodyear is the biggest gamble I feel, out of the 6 I mentioned. Still, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s overvalued in the slightest to warrant a huge sell off. I was very surprised it\u2019s only valued at just below 4 billion. Last year they made more than 10 billion on revenue, and with everyone starting to get back on the road en masse, I think we\u2019ll see things improve due to higher demand.\n\nRemember this is only the moves of a degenerate retard, so you can probably make BIG cash inversing me. Happy trading y\u2019all!"

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

It represents a part of the capital of the company.  \n\nHow big this part per share is differs from company to company.  This capital that is represented by the share is working at the enterprise, and it is (hopefully) earning money now or at some point in the future.  How much money it earns (in terms of future profits)  , and how much money it represents (in terms of real estate, machines, stock, cash , well educated employees) play into the markets evaluation of the price of  a share. A company that has 3 billion shares  and sits on real estate that is worth 3 billion and no debt and doesnt do anything, will trade it 1 Dollar per share. Now this company rents out the real estate and makes money from it, 300 million per year profit after taxes. (ca 10 % profit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow  this company has its value of 1 dollar per share in holdings, and it makes 10 cent profit per year. so how much is the value of the share now? some say 1.1 Dollar, because perhaps they wont get their rent after next year. others say 1.5 dollar, because its stable income over more than the next year.  Others say 3 dollar, because it will have renters in the next 10 years and the real estate value will increase by 50 %. and so on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n That is the market, and after all different opinions come together and bargain, the market price for the share will be set, by buyers and sellers of shares."

That along with uncertain projections on the long term course of the pandemic and other market forces can easily create some short term fud. \n\nThis will likely only affect them short term and their long term projections are good. From a pandemic standpoint paxlovid\u2019s data for efficacy when administered early in disease onset is great and will likely change the landscape of the pandemic quite drastically once they\u2019re able to get an ample supply of it on the market. And I think reasonably covids here forever so paxlovid would be handy. \n\nThat said there\u2019s more that goes into whether a drug is profitable than just whether or not it\u2019s useful. Biotech, medical science, and pharmaceuticals are extremely complex and you shouldn\u2019t invest in those companies for short term gains unless you really understand the industry on both a scientific, regulatory, and economic level.

You see those red ski slopes that follow the green climbs? That's people here selling at the peak to make short term profits. If you are a small investor playing with funds that aren't play money to you, buy at the bottom of that red slope and sell near the top of the green hills, apes. Take a moderate profit, grow the funds in your trading account in small increments, then maybe take a bigger risk when you've actually made a little cash from your trades. Or cash out your profits and get a month ahead on your mortgage or rent, buy a new king size bed, put it in savings for an emergency. There's no shame in that. Ignore the shit posters here.\n\nThe key to gambling, and this most certainly is gambling, is knowing when to walk away. Group think and hope isn't going to lead to winnah winnah chicken dinnah.

     "A friend of mine, even though I begged him not to, sank all of his money (meaning everything in his bank accounts, and pawning his (deceased) father's watch) into GME the morning of January 29th. I told him to wait for a dip after all the nonsense from Robinhood, but he genuinely believed it was going to hit $10k the following week. He'd started moving money into RH earlier that week, and it took him a while to get everything tidy before he was ready to buy. \n\nAt least I convinced him to hold for as long as he can, but he's down around 30% still. Sad part is he's not exactly wealthy, and he's had to stretch (and borrow a bit from me, which of course I don't mind doing) to make it work. \n\nBuyer beware. These memestocks are volatile, and you can't predict hype prices with 100% accuracy. Look at AMC this morning. I think it'll recover, but who knows? If you bought at $65 yesterday, you're probably not having a good morning. Just... realize that it's a gamble. I think some of them are **good** gambles, but I would never, ever, ever, **ever** recommend spending money you need for **food and f\\*&\\^ing shelter** on *any* investment. These are longer plays than you might think. \n\nAlso, a lot of these new investors seem to think they just hit \"sell\" and money magically appears. Someone has to buy it. Just because the price is at $10k doesn't mean you can sell it for $10k. It could be less. Significantly less. It's more than just timing the top, it's timing the top and being able to sell what you want to at that price.\n\nI want everyone to make money, and hope you all do. Just don't bet the damn farm on a meme."

     "Investing rules for most people need to be essentially the same as gambling, because at worst it's that not much different; only bet what you can afford to lose. That doesn't include your rent, food, loan payments, etc.\n\nMeme stocks can certainly help if you get in at the right time, but people that don't already have lots of $$ to invest at once in one thing generally aren't going to be overnight millionaires.  If you bought into AMC/GME back in 2020 with change fished out of the couch, you made out, probably paid off some debt and good for you; but most of those folks didn't know what was going to happen later on in 2021.\n\nMaking smart, long-term choices based on sensible growth is what gets you long-lasting gains.  If you have some play $$, sure, shoot the works or get in on penny stocks or an AMC if you get some info. But few 'putting your entire weekly paycheck into meme stonk' situations are going to pay off before you need that $$, if you're paycheck-to-paycheck or close to it."

The market is kind of weird now. Like it always has fucking been. You think we live in some special point in history? Issac Newton, who invented calculus and formulated the original relativity before Einstein literally was a retard who lost all of his money on worthless flowers because he thought he was rain main with markets. \n\nEvery post talking about Illuminati's and all that other shit just goes further and further to prove people literally cannot accept, or fathom, people aren't smart enough to be able to understand and control markets. Markets are insanely complex. There are far too many input variables. \n\nThose huge hedge funds everyone talks about and how they speak about them completely controlling everything or whatever is ridiculous. Have you ever ACTUALLY looked at their returns? Not some off hand bullshit. Go look at fund managers returns. They are almost, and I do truly mean almost as retarded as us here. The only difference is theoretically, sometimes, they have a retard line that exist that quite literally does the opposite of whatever dumb shit they are about to do so they don't lose money. \n\nThat's right. That stupid joke everyone makes here about inverting our ideas is literally how huge funds operate. They have extremely complicated and sophisticated mathematical models that all amount to them just trying not to blow up while making bad decisions. \n\nThe market is just as dumb as it's always been. There are random speculative assets, and said assets are getting fucked right now. All those \"great\" companies are just returning to earth in line with their actual earnings values instead of speculative values because of cheap cash. Cash itself is losing value because of Keynesian economics. The actual market of things is being threatened by humans fighting (happens all the time) \n\nThe only thing special, if I were to think of a special element of this particular time, is you are just bombarded with much more information than people in the past had, so it just makes things happen faster. And more public. You get more exposure to the idiots who run things, like Masayoshi Son or Elon Musk. Witness the human race in all of it's glory, and buy calls because we have always been this dumb and it's always worked in the end."

Where's all that copper gonna come from?Further renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines require approximately five times more copper than gas and coal-powered electricity generation. As the Europoors and Liberals cry for more renewable energy, guess who is slowly making tendies. Copper miners.\n\nFucking Silver.

Until recently no one ever cared about this rare piece of shit metal.Then, some automaker thought, hmmmm - let's shove this up the ass end of a really huge SUV. Like Magic, it converted all the toxic shit into ........barely breathable air. Almost every catalytic convertor has a few grams of this metal. Like...... let's save the earth by mining something that's 30x rarer than gold.  Where else is it used? In fuel cells, in fucking dental fillings, and electronic components.Where do we get it from? Mostly South Africa and Russia. Two countries where political risk is relatively high. One's a young democracy with growing pains, the other is a country that want's to fuck up the world because NATO hurt its' feelings.\n\nBuy this shit. Also, Not Financial Advice."

It was the drug they touted on their earnings call a couple of weeks ago.  It's marketed (for now and down the road as a weight loss medication) as a Type 2 diabetes drug to lower your A1C.  The massive benefit is for the 20mg dose, the average weight loss was 21.6% Bodyweight, or 52# on average for the test group.  72 week study with over 2500 participants.  Once a week injection.\n\nThis will be bigger than Viagra.  Viagra is just for men.  Men AND Women are obese in the US and the world.  It's the holy grail.  It's what everyone has wanted since the 80's.  Give me a shot once a week and I'll lose 50#.  Estimates are it'll be a $30B drug by 2030.  It has one other competitor out there that starts with an 'O', but my notes aren't in front of me so I don't remember, but this is more effective.  No, it's not your typical WSB YOLO on 0DTE, but it WILL moon over the next 5 years.\n\n\\*edited to clean up numbers\n\n[Tirzepatide](https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-breaks-record-for-weight-loss-in-latest-clinical-trial-results)\n\n[Lilly's investor link on the drug](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-tirzepatide-delivered-225-weight-loss-adults-obesity-or)"

It says it itself if you actually go to the source and not the sensationalized journalism:\n\n>The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak. As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented because of detection bias. Third, demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants; further study is underway to identify other population characteristics among cases, such as additional demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.\\*\\*\\* MA DPH, CDC, and affected jurisdictions are collaborating in this response; MA DPH is conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples for genomic sequencing, and linking case information with laboratory data and vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.\u2020\u2020\u2020 Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings."

The data from Israel, whose vaccine strategy was very much like ours, suggests  the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine is reduced by 1/2 every 3-4 weeks. Now, I\u2019m not saying that there are dishonest players in big pharma who used their lobbying clout to get Pfizer a 27B deal for a questionable product, but it seems as Pfizer lobbyists perhaps used their clout in DC to get a 27B deal for a questionable product, and now they are pushing for booster shots for a vaccine that perhaps doesn\u2019t work that well. \n\nInactivated Virus vaccines create t-cells that can ward off infection potentially for years. Also, antivax people can\u2019t shout weird things about genetic modifications with these vaccines. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying, actually, is I\u2019m buying OCGN calls on Monday. Covaxin is likely getting WHO approval this month, they have a manufacturing plant set up in US,  they have the right to sell in Canada who will perhaps provide doses to the rest of the world. So even if the FDA is as cognitively deficient as joe biden himself and we don\u2019t get Covaxin, that Stock is gonna pump with WHO approval and then I\u2019m moving to Europe while the US turns into the Last of Us."

     "Have some problems with this DD. The first is who creates money in the modern economy? See this:\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654)\n\nSo commercial banks create money in the modern economy when the bank creates a loan on its books. Commercial banks literally create money out of thin air. The money is \u2018extinguished\u2018 when the loan is repaid to the bank. The only role of the central bank (read the Fed in US) in the modern economy is to control the ambient interest rates. Controlling the interest rates controls the rate at which commercial banks issue new loans. High interest rates tend to decrease the issuing of new loans by the commercial banks whereas low interest rates tend to encourage the issuing of new loans. ie the money supply. If the rate at which commercial banks issue new loans matches the rate at which the economy is expanding, then all is well. Interest rates can remain relatively low and everyone feels relatively prosperous. If this process overheats, interest rates are too low, the economy is not expanding to match, then the result is inflation.\n\nWhat however happens if the central bank has already reduced interest rates to near zero in an unsuccessful attempt to get commercial banks to write new loans and thereby \u2018stimulate\u2019 the economy?\n\nThis is how we now get to QE. See:\n\n[https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/quantitative-easing)\n\n(BTW this explanation of QE has been significantly altered by the BoE recently. It used to describe QE as \u2018asset purchasing\u2019 by the central bank)\n\nQuote:\n\n\u2018In addition, QE can stimulate the economy by boosting a wide range of financial asset prices.\n\nSuppose we buy \u00a31 million of government bonds from a pension fund. In place of the bonds, the pension fund now has \u00a31 million in money. Rather than hold on to this money, it might invest it in financial assets, such as shares, that give it a higher return. And when demand for financial assets is high, with more people wanting to buy them, the value of these assets increases. This makes businesses and households holding shares wealthier \u2013 making them more likely to spend more, boosting economic activity.\u2019\n\nFor \u2018government bonds\u2019 read US Treasuries. The pension fund reference is very telling: by far the largest pool of \u2018dumb\u2019 money anywhere. In the US the Fed has not just been buying Treasuries but corporate bonds. Corporate debt. Mortgage backed securities- MBS. Who knows what else in secret through the plunge protection team.\n\nMoney has entered the real economy in the shape of unemployment protection payments and direct stimulus checks. This has not been matched by any GDP activity - or grossly reduced activity. It has been \u2018paid for\u2019 by increasing the total national debt. It\u2019s a miracle it has not been inflationary, but people are wary of spending. They are buying durables like washing machines, microwaves and cars. Where ever they can they are paying down unsecured debt. Those with an excess are banking it or - buying stocks!\n\nNot sure if M2 money supply has gone up or down, but velocity is way down. M2 velocity really matters.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V)\n\nTLDR: You\u2019re wrong. \\[Edit: short term you are right, long term wrong\\] . The Fed has indirectly inflated all asset classes including stocks and housing market. Money printer can go brrrr some more - much more. Of course, the further it goes, the more spectacular the crash. The only question is whether the Fed has the balls or the US Govt allows it. Or the rest of the world calls the US bluff. My feeling is we are reaching one of those break point."

     "The economy is fucked for all the reasons you listed. I am not confident that will translate to a large sell-off in the markets.\n\nPremise 4: People have been saying this since March. The theory makes sense to my smooth brain but we haven't seen crazy deflation, liquidity isn't a problem for corporations, and markets have continued to rally.\n\nContracting credit in general: Credit markets are contracting for *consumers*. Corporate bond yields are still at all-time lows, even junk bonds. Publicly traded companies are having no trouble getting extremely cheap money and the Fed is ready to buy trillions more in bonds should they need to. JPow still has Robinhood on his phone and will buy all the junk bond ETFs he needs to at a moment's notice. Institutions know this and have way over-extended in the corporate bond markets because they think the Fed will bail them out (and the Fed has ruined the yields of safer assets). This means the Fed will *have* to bail out corporate bonds, because if they don't shit will blow up even bigger than if they'd done nothing in March. Yeah everything is real bad for normies, but stonks have little to do with the real economy and that's been especially true for the last few years.\n\nPremise 6: Banks are always buying bonds. The question is if bond buying has increased lately. [The rate of bond purchases accelerated in March and has kept the same pace through the face-ripping rally off the lows](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TASACBW027SBOG). However in mid/late October it's accelerated even more. So, there's a chance there's something to this."

If you think the totality of retail investors are exclusively or are the majority reason driving stock growth you're a fucking moron. Hedge funds and banks are constantly shifting around tens of billions worth of instruments every day. When (eg) Tesla booms like it did this week it's because hedges are buying collosal fuck tons of stock and calls, probably to cover short positions. Big money makes huge plays all the time and that's what drives markets."

I suspect after the election is when things will really start to head down.  \n\n\nDo you understand that the banking system works on whats called \"fractional reserve system\"?  \n\n\nWhen the FED injects those extra reserve assets, it allows the banks to create an 10x extra that amount of money they hold on their balance sheets. So if the FED injects 1million into a commercial banks reserve assets, it essentially allows the commercial bank to loan out, or use up to 10million in assets. That's how the FED indirectly prints money."

All indications of a market top but vaccine EUA may put a floor under market and your puts may get fucked by theta. Also the EUA and vaccine may just continue rotation into value and cyclicals like XOM, TAP, DIA, INTC and others. Lastly traditionally the market rallies after Thanksgiving through year end. I think you are a little early. My guess is that there will be setbacks with vaccine distribution in the new year and the market will tank in January after a modest holiday rally."

Amazon was a bubble stock at $200... and if everything is a bubble.. is it really a bubble or that fact that all boats are rising.\n\nThe economy is not the stock market.  The FED may not be able to openly PRINT money... but money supply - yes the amount of money in circulation HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER....  never!! and its a coordinated effort around the globe.\n\nMoney has neve been cheaper.  Mortgage rates at an all time low.  Central Banks hell bent on keeping their feet on the gas pedal.  The government ready to dole out more money to everyone.  You could surely craft a bearish perspective.  No doubt.\n\nHowever we got the worst economic disaster of our lifetimes.  And the stock market rallied to to new record highs.\n\nExclamation point.  end of sentence."

Let\u2019s just take a second to remember that you\u2019re one market participant in a giant market full of idiots and other way smarter people and some in between who know enough to be really dangerous .. and you should be humbled when thinking of how you\u2019re like a few grains of sand in the ocean or similarly like the size of your bedroom compared to the universe. Whether an idiot or a smart market participant \u2014 predictions like these are more likely than not to age poorly. The reason I say this is because it seems you spent so much time trying to be smart in explaining stuff to a bunch of idiots. Why would a smart person do this...? Well I don\u2019t know. But while I\u2019m here I thought I\u2019d add my 2\u00a2:\n\nYour premise #4 on QE being deflationary could be correct in the long term (Japan probably best example) but it can also be inflationary in the short term. The short term pressures are related to the velocity of money which comes down to bank lending. As you mentioned when the Fed buys securities it increases bank reserves and inflationary pressure would only occur if the banks lend that money out so the velocity of money is limited by banks lending abilities and risk tolerance. Right now banks are drowning in deposits and aren\u2019t able to earn much by lending out money \u2014 plus they have to be very careful in this environment not to make bad loans with such a small net interest margin and unemployment still elevated at historical levels. Needless to say there are many factors that make it seem like the velocity of money is low. But if these vaccines succeed and nothing else gets all fucked up it seems there could be a scenario (not sure of probability) where things get back to \u201cnormal\u201d fairly quickly after that.. and if that happens we could be shifting from a pandemic-lockdown-deflationary-contracting-environment to a more-inflationary-expansionary-environment. \n\nAnd now let\u2019s just take a second to recognize how no one knows fucking shit... :):)"

Also, ever consider that the long-term low interest rate environment (with signaling that it will continue to be like this) fundamentally causes valuation multiples to re-rate? That\u2019s the problem with historical analysis, the world is fundamentally different now. So why are multiples expanding? Because interest rates are low and investors need to reach for riskier and risked investments to maintain rates of return. Essentially chasing yield. Investors go for treasury to IG to HY to blue chip and beyond. By your logic, you would\u2019ve gotten out of the market in 2015 waiting for the dip, which didn\u2019t come until the pandemic five years later and you still would\u2019ve been worse off lol. I\u2019ve seen so many people try to time markets and it\u2019s hilarious to watch. Take another page out of Buffett/Graham\u2019s handbook and think about mr market. Do you need to sell now? Think about it as owning a business instead of a stock and you make much better decisions. FYI, you think Buffett is out of the market now? Haha\n\nWhile the \u2018market\u2019 has become over valued, look at why. The breadth of the recent run up from covid has been extremely narrow. Almost all of the run up has been in only a handful of stocks- FAANGM. Take a look at the market valuation excluding these stocks and you will see a great opportunity. As vaccine optimism works its way into the rest of the market, you will see a rotation to value and cyclical stocks and likely out of tech. What does that do to overall valuation of the market? Who is to say.It will probably keep it flattish, but bigger names will have less influence on the overall market as the capital will be dispersed to the rest of the market. \n\nRunning on vaccine fumes is a joke, where do you think the market will be in March when the vaccine is in the process of rolling out?\n\nWhen people say the fed is printing money it\u2019s because it\u2019s effectively true. They are increasing the money supply by purchasing newly issued treasuries from banks. It credits the banks, which is treated like cash even though it doesn\u2019t print cash. The cash is considered bank reserves, but banks only are required to hold a specific amount of reserves so all extra is used to maximize profit through lending/purchasing of long duration assets. You highlighted increasing amounts in high quality securities. Go down to line 9 oh they are increasing loans and leases as well. Oh and that number is 2x the size of treasury and agency securities lmao. Premise 5: feds funds are entering the market that is why you are seeing the markets stabilize (that downward tick). Banks don\u2019t just hold the reserves in hand. They lose out on yield. Even if they are buying bonds, lending, etc. that money enters the economy. Sure they may be holding more reserves than before, but that is natural in a pandemic! Premise 7: the market is forward looking and most of the unemployment is viewed as temporary. As the pandemic drags on, more and more losses will become permanent, but they will be nowhere near as high as \u201808. Probably shake out somewhere around 6%. \n\nAgain, glad you are the person on the other side of the table. FYI, I work professionally in the markets."

     "> As you can see, the market has been repeatedly rejecting multiple new highs. This process was briefly interrupted by positive vaccine news. We breached a new high on Pfizer vaccine results, but even that new high was instantly rejected and resulted in a sudden reversal selloff. The Moderna vaccine news created another short rally, lower than the Pfizer high, and that too was followed by a selloff. In other words, the market is continually rejecting current market valuations. \n\n\nLol no. You can\u2019t just fucking say it keeps rejecting new highs when we just made one, and then say \u201cok but that was a one off\u201d. It could very well test and break it again. What if it breaks 3660 on some other stimulus vaccine need? \u201cOk but its just another one off that was rejected, won\u2019t happen again.\u201d It\u2019s overvalued but very likely your timing is way off."

     "The Fed has created the illusion that risk no longer exists because they will simply backstop any bad thing that happens with regard to liquidity and corporate credit. While I think that the actions they took in February and March were necessary they also created a massive equity bubble and have done nothing to temper it because there\u2019s simply no political will for short term pain or disappointing Wall Street.\n\nPowell learned this lesson in Q4 of 2018 when the mere idea of raising rates sent the market spiraling down and had everyone attacking him. In a way this environment was inevitable after that and I think when we do finally crash and come out of this period that time will be viewed as the precursor to this absurd market completely divorced from reality or earnings.\n\nOne additional point about valuations- yes P/Es are historically insane, sentiment is at an extreme level across the board- even bears have largely capitulated now- speculation is extremely high in the dumb money crowd. But there\u2019s another indicator that is also a tell on this and that is the number of secondary offerings which is very elevated. This can be interpreted as a bearish contrarian indicator because it\u2019s another sign of a high amount of speculative activity. Companies that need to raise capital find a public more than willing to give it to them.\n\nAlso there\u2019s a very popular narrative about seasonality being bullish and even if a selloff happens it won\u2019t be until well into the new year so a contrarian argument could be made that we get a large selloff before EOY.\n\nFinally, price wise, the most bearish factor is that the stocks that led this bull market- mainly the fangs- have completely topped out and to use your term seem to be running on fumes. Apple, Amazon, etc. made their last high on September 3rd and still haven\u2019t come close to retaking it. They are no longer in a bull market and while a number of people I follow view this action as a consolidating base for further upside, I believe the next big money will be made shorting these stocks.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m not a permabull or permabear either, but every one of my indicators regarding sentiment and valuations is screaming sell. The same indicators that told me to start getting short in January. I follow a number of people in fintwit whose sentiment is off the charts and are solidly in euphoric territory. I started talking about this two weeks ago. I\u2019m positioned for a major correction/crash by mid January. We shall see. As a bear trying to time a top it hurts like shit until you finally cross the apex and start coming down the other side. Then it\u2019s all worthwhile. These idiots who are in denial or like to say shit like \u201cbears have called 30 of the last two crashes\u201d don\u2019t realize that 1) virtually every permabull gives back everything they made in the bull market and then some because they can\u2019t resist the obvious dip buying opportunities on the way down before they finally capitulate and find a new passion in life (which is why they don\u2019t outperform the s&p in the long run) and 2) a bear only needs to be right once and will make 10x what the bulls make."

     "So I read most of your post as a case of benefit of doubt but gave up once you started using numbers and it looked more like a pitch to join an MLM...\n\nI did look up o'leary as suggested and I do agree with his viewpoint however I interpret his statement differently from you.\n\nI agreed with Kevin O'Leary that it could work as a business becuase in truth there really are millions of people who would love to hear trumps voice.\n\nAnd yes, i do agree that there is a large scope from O' learys viewpoint becuase no one really knows what else this platform can do becuase no one really said what it was going to be. \n\nBut that's from the point of view of it being a viable business. Being a viable business however doesn't really mean the share price is even close to it being something to buy unless it triggers a YOLO urge. And that probably won't happen until this share is shorted to hell.\n\nIt's only been around since late Feb. There's basically zero proof on its ability to monetize or at least monetize consistently. \n\nThe downloads were impressive at the beginning but its basically down to about 95%. So I guess the fans who wanted it already have it. Similarly the daily users have dropped to a few 100,000s.\n\nNow don't get me wrong I'm not talking about the politics involved.. but just from the viewpoint of it as a business itself. Its viable. So yeah u can go long on it and it could probably be something of value in 5 -10 years if run well. But my advice is go long only if u can get the share for less than a few bucks. \n\nRight now, the only thing that could really assign some value to this company are actually the consumers it represents. However, I don't think the current 1.4 billion market cap is something that could withstand multiple correction phases once the normal routine of submitting Financial reports sets in. \n\nAnd one last thing... money doesn't respect politics and political views... money only cares about whether it can grow. And, Politics is just one of many tools for money to do so. \n\nNot advice blah blah.. at own risk.. blah blah blah."

The Fed has 2 priorities: (1) Maximum employment (2) Price Stability and low inflation. Everything else is secondary.\\n2. Markets have priced in a 2x taper by March ish, a 2-3 rate hike in 2022.\\n3. Omicron hasn't caused lockdowns YET, except it most likely will due to the 2x transmisibility. Although Omicron is 90% less severe, and vaccines still work 70-75% for hospitalisations, Omicron is a wildcard. The International Energy Agency predicted a reduced demand for oil due to Omicron as well just a few days back.\\n4. Pfizer's 89% pill's final data is reasonable. Possible FDA approval end of year.\\n5. Maximum employment seems to have been reached since 4.2% (4.5% expected)\"",

     "Interesting DD. If he did raise rates now it would cause the market to panic-sell, so I definitely don\u2019t expect a December rate raise.\n\nMy assumption is that he will do what he said he would do: double-speed the tapering so that it finishes at the end of March 2022. Then in 2022 he will announce a 0.25% interest rate hike and the exact number and timing is going to depend on how inflation is between now and then, how the supply chain issues are resolving, if Omicron is overflowing the hospitals and killing lots of people / causing shutdowns (whether the gov\u2019t mandates it or not, a good portion of people will choose to stay home / voluntarily shut themselves down if the hospitals are full and tons of people are dying.)\n\nI don\u2019t see how the used car prices will come down any time soon, because the chip shortage is a bottleneck for producing new cars. Also if people are getting big raises because of inflation, businesses will raise their prices (aka cause inflation) and that becomes the basis for more raises. Inflation could get \u201cstuck\u201d around 7% if businesses and employees start expecting that to be the inflation level, which would mean that JPow would eventually need to go full Volker and cause a brief recession to knock out the inflation.\n\nHowever, this economy has been addicted to low rates and QE since the Great Recession, and I\u2019m not sure it could handle the kind of rapid rate raises it would take to tackle inflation. It could put a lot of zombie companies out of business, and those companies employ many millions of people, thus running up against the other half of the dual mandate which is full employment. Longer term I do think it\u2019s best to get off of QE and get rates back up."

NOW as we all know by now roughly about 120k+ (12 million+ shares) call options expired In The Money on Feb 26 at $8.01. The street sentiment is that AMC\\'s price will be rising on Monday because the number of shares needed to brought to covered call options expired ITM. Fundamentally speaking that\\'s how the price of a security goes up, buy buy and more buying, there is no exception here. If the price of AMC goes down by 20% after the HF brought million of shares to cover their calls that really wouldn\\'t make any sense at all. That only explanation is the HF\\'s decided to HOLDOUT for a few days so they can ladder attack to lower the price before buying million of shares to cover their calls.\\n\\nLet just assumed that price spike up to between $15-$20 on Monday, this is an HF\\'s \"Bull '",

In PM it went over 23.\n\nAnd on that day it was primed to go over 30 until the RH, Webull, IBKR and others stopped people from buying causing a massive shift in market sentiment."

This is why other funds jumped in with us. \nSo good squeeze potential \n\nGreat mid to long term play. \nVaccines and a lot of demand for theaters in a post pandemic world. The memes speak to this\n\nGreat long play as a lot of movies are yet to be played because they didn\u2019t wanna release them for small profits in a world without theater revenue\n\nGreat American Business and we know how much that matters to people. Plus management focused on reinventing the movie experience to become more of a event. With food and drinks \ud83c\udf7a \n\nNostalgia factor. We all have a good memory from the theaters. \n\nIt\u2019s just a all around safe play for the long term and a even better play in the short term because if you pussies HOLD and don\u2019t sell at the first sign of profits we compound multiple gamma squeezes and run these shorts to utter bankruptcy. And you have a fail safe if they try to tank the market like last time. \n\nIt\u2019s in my opinion a stronger thesis than $GME and I\u2019m seriously all in on it cause well\n\nI LIKE THE STOCK \n\nAlso NOT A DEAD CAT"

     "Genomics tells us that omicron did not evolve from a recent variant. Instead it evolved either from the original virus or the alpha variant. There are two ways that this could\u2019ve occurred. An immuno compromised individual may have had a prolonged infection that allowed for multiple mutations to occur over months or even a year or longer. Alternatively the virus jumped to an animal which was able to infect other animals of its species creating a reservoir of the virus. The C19 virus has been shown to infect multiple other animals, including cats & dogs however, other than minks no other animal spread the infection to other animals of their species creating a coronavirus animal reservoir. \n\nA recent study showed strong evidence that a South African mouse reservoir of SARS-Cov-2  was the source of the Omicron Variant. Animal reservoirs create multiple mutations in the coronavirus, if the virus jumps back to humans as Omicron did, the virus produces profound immune escape. \n\nThe bad news is that Whitetail deer in the Midwest have also created a SARS-Cov-2 reservoir. The coronavirus is guaranteed to mutate in this reservoir as well. When the virus jumps back to humans, expect a new source of multiple worrisome mutations. Mouse reservoirs of the coronavirus in South Africa & white tailed deer reservoirs in the Midwest indicate that we are not done with the coronavirus & future worrisome variants.

There is no Novavax delay, we just applied for EUA in the UK today. There IS, however, a Bharat delay, they got a \"talk to the hand\" from the WHO yesterday. Bear in mind, the WHO application has NOTHING to do with Ocugen, which does not have any sales agreements at all, much less any commercialization rights in any countries that give a flying fuck about the WHO. Lastly, you can't supply what you don't produce, and Ocugen is currently producing... nothing.So, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail. Nice job."

     "Finishing my doctorate in clinical psychology (one year away, woo!) and am very interested in this approach to treatment.  I fully anticipate opening a practice that utilizes psychedelics in the future but it's many years off until that actually occurs.  The first psychedelic expected to be granted regulatory approval is MDMA through the MAPS organization because they're the furthest along in the phase 3 FDA trial but it's not even expected to clear these hurdles until 2025.  MAPS is also a nonprofit and will likely be able to drastically undercut MNMD on prices for these substances in the future as long as MAPS gets there first in terms of clearing regulatory hurdles.  They'll already have approvals for MDMA under their belt by the time they move on to psilocybin (which they are already doing) and will likely be able to do the same undercutting for that substance as well.  Psilocybin is arguably the most exciting substance in this approach to treatment thus far and is incredibly cheap to produce- a profit-seeking company like MNMD will have a very difficult uphill battle to fight every step of the way.\n\nPair this with the complete lack of knowledge about the efficacy of these treatments by the vast majority of people in my field and you have a huge problem for MNMD.  I'm quite literally the only person in my program who ever discusses this approach to treatment- the faculty are completely unaware that this is a thing or only have tangential knowledge about what used to take place prior to the beginning of the \"war on drugs.\"  This is going to radically shift approaches to mental health treatment but it's **a decade** away at least from being a reality in the grand scheme of things.  This approach to treatment currently requires special training as it's radically different from every other approach taught thus far.  There's simply no infrastructure in place for such a radical shift to occur in any sort of meaningful way that will make this company viable for a long, long time."

Besides some vomiting (and losing touch with reality) for several hours, there were no long term negative health effects. In fact, there were actually positive effects, with one person having improvement with a mood disorder, even 20 years after the incident, and another getting relief from chronic pain. The other case was of a woman that did not know she was pregnant when ingesting the LSD and the child had a normal birth and no discernable health effects though adult life."

It is unknown how many non vaccinated individuals have covid immunity from prior infections. There are many people who have had subclinical infections and sub-hospitalization infections with the original virus -both vaccinated and unvaccinated. The only way to really tell how much immunity is out there is to randomly antibody test people.\n\nI personally doubt anything will be as bad as last year because most people\u2019s immune systems have seen some form of this covid lineage now, whereas back in March 2020 it was a completely novel lineage of coronavirus that humans had never been exposed to before.\n\nGood luck but I think the easy money covid train has left the station."

As COVID vaccines reveal themselves to be much less efficacious that initially marketed and as Moderna vaccines are said to induce pretty severe side effects notably (see recommendations against it for young males in Europe), I see a potential aggressive short in this stock for 2022. They have a great ally though, and it's one of their patent holder: Anthony Fauci. But Fauci might become a handicap in the future for his potential role into gain of function research in China, his lies to Congress and his conflict of interests that absolutely no one can ignore. His fall into total disgrace might just be a matter of time (hopefully) and might drag Moderna with it. I could see the CEO progressively trying to exit. The dominoes might fall very quickly if it happens.\\nOn the other side, the risk to the upside still exist. \"",
