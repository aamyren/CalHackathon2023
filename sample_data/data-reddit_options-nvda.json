I understand its a volatile stock but I couldn't understand how to price these events or scenarios in while picking a strike price. At the time of selling, the prob of ITM was 18% and today its 50%. granted its only an indicator and not surity, but can you provide any ideas about what other metrics to look at while picking a strike price.\\n\\nI own the stock but didn't want it called away if it comes to that.

Your max gain is $2750. \n\nShort flies are tough. They hold on to their value for a long time. So any intraday movement in your favor might not give you a good exit. \n\nThe question is how likely you think the bear case is. Is that just insurance on a tank? There are structures that would give you better returns and a lower break even on the high side. Like a ZEBRA with +2/-1 (or +3/-2) 295c 310c. You can add a put or put spread to that for mitigating losses on the low case. \n\nA reverse-risk reversal where you sell a put to finance a call would also pay better and reduce your breakeven in the bullish case.\n\nIf you think the bear case has a high probability, then I would try and tighten it up. You lose money between 298.39 and 326.61 which is a $28 range with a $20 straddle. The potential for a miss is there but there\u2019s also the potential for a modest pop that doesn\u2019t reach 326 or passes it but runs down the rest of the day."

These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo. Strategy suggestions welcome\"",

The deeper itm it goes the less extrinsic value no matter expiration. I definitely wouldn\u2019t let it go below .10.  I\u2019d just buy 100 shares to stop the upside bleed if I had the bp.  If it drops below your strike just sell the shares.  Preferably you want to buy the shares when your call gets breached. But better late than never.  It could go to 400. Who knows.  It can get assigned even if you have a long call.  Being part of a spread doesn\u2019t prevent assignment on the short leg.  Buying shares is how you hedge a short option.

Generative AI only needs high-compute power during the Neural net training, once it is trained you don't need nearly as much compute to run it for consumers. Also Meta will develop it's own in-house AI chip. Finally CUDA which is supposedly the main MOAT of NVIDIA has been open-sourced last year, other Chip manufacturers could simply use it as a base to develop their own chip interface."

I\u2019m thinking about hedging for earnings but that is to be seen. \n\nSame as you and as everyone else, I think it\u2019s overhyped and overvalued, and unlike others here, I think there\u2019s potential for disappointing words in the conference call even if they say AI in every sentence. \n\nMy voodoo analysis consists of several factors - \n\n1. Yes there\u2019s an uptrend but I think there are statistical indications that it is exhausting - there are numerous bearish divergences on both weekly and daily timeframes; the rsi is getting too high and  I think the past few days have been way too optimistic. I use 2.25 sigmas on keltner for observations and everything that penetrates that raises and alarm for me. Voodoo, I tell you. \n\n2. Their cfo sold stock just weeks ago. He wouldn\u2019t give away millions. One director sold after him. This was march at 200, 230 and 275. \n\n3. All ratios and multiples and industry comparisons are way too high in the stratosphere. \n\n4. Option prices for earning expiration expect a c. 20$ move and protected butterflies are more than 2.1 for a 2.5 spread. This to me indicates high probability of ab outsized move. \n\nYeah sure I may be (very) wrong and they can fly higher and destroy my summer plans and convert my Italy vacation with pasta, ravioli and pasta to camping with just bread and lettuce, but I think the recent higher buying was from more option participants which forced option sellers buy so they\u2019re covered.

With every day that passes, NVDA will have to move further into the positive for the call to go up in value. When you're down to the wire, you'll find that *any* negative movement will kill the call, and even if the stock is flat or slightly positive, that doesn't mean the call will go up. It needs to go up by a larger and larger amount the closer you get to expiration because it becomes less and less likely that NVDA will hit your $415 strike by then.  \n\n\nIf you sold the call, this isn't a bad thing. You'll get to keep the premium and your 100 shares of NVDA.   \n\n\nIf you bought the call, then I suggest you probably cut your losses because the theta will crush you soon."

This is absolutely madness and the upcoming recession riding on the back of inflation fears has made it difficult to justify this price. Hence, I'm thinking of buying Puts on NVDA but with longer dated expiration.\\n\\nHowever, I think NVDA will cross $300 in this month, fueled by a rally as CPI headline comes cooler on the 12th April. Which should lower the Puts premium. What do you think?

     "The plan is a bit numerically flawed, because of the following:\n\nA 4x to 5x profit that you're seeking, if you pay $3.5 for a 100P, occurs if NVDA falls to $80-86.  So it sounds like that's the price you're targeting.\n\nIf you bought a 150P for $13.87 (today's last price), you'd get a 5x profit at $81.\n\nThe reason you'd get a 100P is if you're envisioning the stock hitting a price much less than $80, such as $50.  That is when it returns a much higher multiple than a 150P.\n\nI am a fan of the thesis that NVDA is hyped up, and it will fall back to reality.  I'd be a bigger fan of the $150P if the target price was $10/share -- the idea that the stock would have a chance of proving itself to be a miserable, unprofitable, failing company that has no hope for the future.\n\nThe problem I see is that NVIDIA ships a desirable product.  People want GPUs.  There are lots of reasons to want GPUs -- they're a general purpose product, and NVIDIA making enough profit to justify a $100 share price is very plausible.\n\nA total collapse in share price would be more plausible if there was a story where they got in direct competition with another GPU maker, like AMD, and drove margins down to zero.  But their product is not directly and precisely interchangeable.  A collapse in share price would be more plausible if businesses just decided, hey, they're giving up on machine learning, and self-driving cars are proven impossible, or the auto market has shown they will not use NVIDIA hardware/software in the future.\n\nI don't see a strong reason to believe that mindset shift would occur.  So I wouldn't buy the 100P or the 150P.\n\nI think if you do buy a 100P, you should be seeking a 10x profit or 15x profit.  You need a high payoff target to justify the purchase."

     "> The Long call for the same duration looks to be more expensive. Is this the right reason to buy a bull call spread?\n\nThis is always true because the short call helps mitigate the cost of the long call. A-B < A for AB>0. This in itself is not a good idea to enter a debit call. Apart from the classic \"what do you know will happen in 3 years...\" here is what:\n\nIn this instance, you will keep 7000 of buying power just to make 23,000 that may not happen. This will not \"mature\" into anywhere close to 23,000 anytime soon, because the moment it spikes, the short leg will also increase in value. If you don't need the 7000 you can just buy shorter-term with similar risks/reward. \n\nA better way is to just go with quarterly or even 6-months ITM Leaps, selling calls weekly. ETA: Or if you are truly convinced, you could just buy and sell the legs at more reasonable delta, and then just buy multiples of them. \n\nYou only make 23,000 if NVDA >= 750 on expiry. If they only finished 455, you lose money. If they finished at 535 you would have parked your 7000 for 20% gains. Almost three years for 20%... You probably can beat that easily."

But could you?\r  \n\r  \nSuppose you bought at $300 and sold the $275 CC for $37.  It drops to $210. Your short call expires.  Cost basis is $263 ($53 loss).  Now you're either going to have to write a lower strike that locks in a loss or you're going to have to sell an OTM CC with a further out expiration in order to get enough premium to break even (60 days, 90 days?).  How many months does that take? This all works until it doesn't.\r  \n\r  \nCCs and CSPs of the same series are synthetically equivalent.  Why do this in two transactions (stock + CC) when you can do it in one (CSP)?  Fewer commissions, fewer fees, less bid-ask slippage.\r  \n\r  \nWash sales are meaningless as long as you are out of the stock by the end of the year and you stay out for 30 days.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are fine with owning the stock at the net cost (stock price less premium received for the CC), go for it.

     "I cringe every time I see \"deep ITM\" and \"sell to open\" in the same sentence.\n\nAnyone who calls themself a \"wealth architect\" might as well have \"scammer\" tatooed to their forehead.\n\nThe trade scheme boils down to selling overpriced volatility. That's standard credit trading mechanics and can be accomplished any number of ways, most of which, IMO, have better risk/reward and other characteristics. For example, you could obtain a similar rate of return by rolling OTM short puts, only the puts should have less opportunity cost.\n\n> Wash sale rule could cause tax implications if you rebuy shares that are called away without waiting 31 days (i.e. must pay taxes on the full premium received, but can't write off the \"loss\" of the shares).\n\nAs long as you close the washing trade in the same tax year, this is a non-issue.\n\n> There is no upside potential if the stock moves higher.\n\nYes, but that's true of all credit trading and/or delta-neutral strategies for selling overpriced vol. So not really a negative.\n\n> Lower risk to the downside on the trade (compared to selling OTM covered calls).\n\nI understand why you think that, but it's basically not true. They both have the same downside risk on the stock side. In the ITM CC case, you got more upfront premium, but at higher risk of assignment with attendant higher loss of potential gains on the shares. In the OTM CC case, you have less upfront premium, with lower risk of assignment and lower potential loss of gains.\n\n> If the stock does drop significantly, your cost-basis/breakeven has been lowered considerably\n\nThat's just a restatement of the previous \"advantage\".\n\nTo me, the biggest negative about the scheme is that it is grossly inefficient of capital. There are more efficient ways to use that amount of capital or better ways to use less capital for the same risk/reward.

I am not using any margin at this point, but I have a large amount of margin availability.  Yes, nvda is incredibly volatile. Last year I had sold 10 puts with a 145 strike and the stock dropped to 110, and I got assigned. Unfortunately I dumped those as soon as nvda hit 150. Dumb move. But this scenario does look interesting and I found I can buy a 1/24 185 put for $10 in case things go to hell again, leaving me with $9,000 per contract set. Appreciate the insights!"

     "There are a number of names for that strategy - the one I hear most often is a \"covered strangle\".\n\nI do that strategy with weeklies or monthlies on a number of stocks.  In good times, it earns me a lot of money.  In bad times (like last year), I basically wind up rolling everything forward to out into the future.  (I'm basically right now starting to catch up with things I had rolled out last year when everything was tanking.)\n\nAs is often pointed out on this sub, shorting a put is really the same - from a risk standpoint - as shorting a call.  And so a covered strangle is the same as simply doing two covered calls.\n\nThe one advantage you get, though, is that it generally requires less of your buying power to short a naked put than it does to buy the stock.  And, of course, if you have $30k cash in your portfolio, that's enough to buy 100 shares without borrowing money, but not enough to buy 200 shares.\n\nYMMV, but https://imgur.com/a/3LjjUmC has the results I have gotten over the last three years with my mostly-covered-strangle account.  You can see it is far, far more volatile than the market as a whole."

American style options can be exercised at any time, so a temporary dip/spike might just ruin your account (which has been happening every day).\n\nI think selling leaps is actually awful personally.

     "I used to swing trade it when it was $18-22 range years ago. Sold at $22 for like a $250 gain and have been waiting for it to drop back for like 6 years lol. \n\nA few years ago I had decent luck selling vertical spreads outside its general range wherever it settles after a big move. Premium is good but you're obviously at risk of any news moving it against you and you have to pretty much take off the month they post earnings. I would usually close positions at like 25-50% max profit because I didn't like holding too long. If it moved within a day or two of my entering I'd sometimes just take a hundred dollar gain and close it. \n\nI stopped trading it around COVID when it just became way too hard to predict. Took a few losses in a row and decided to take a break from it. Used to be like my goto option symbol for years but I haven't traded it for a while now."

     "The best way to return on something like this is to just short the stock.  A delta of 1 with no expiry and then sell OTM short puts to raise your entry basis.  Especially if you have a longer term outlook like a recession that can last months, if not years.  While you will pay a small % in short fees, you can let the stock do whatever, while you gather premium and artificially raise your basis, like an inverted covered call.  \n\nIf you are targeting short momentum bursts (i.e. doing short term swing trades for a few days), you need to map out your target areas.  You can do this with daily/weekly/monthly lows, Fibonacci targets, longer term moving averages, crosses of indicators to signal that momentum has shifted on a shorter time frame (say the 4hr vs. the daily).  Since options can and will go to zero, you need to pay a bit more attention to your entries.  Unlike stocks where, as long as you have sized appropriately, you can theoretically let the sit on the position forever until it turns green, options have a finite window to execute and this is why most people have a defined magnitude or a certain % gain they make on the trade where they close it and move onto the next setup.  For example, I was short NVDA with a PDS from $163 or so with a target of $150.  I took my profits on Wednesday or Thursday last week with a 30% return on my investment.  Had I held, I could have effectively doubled my investment today, however, the future is unknown.  $NVDA could have bounced and turned that 30% profit right back to entry.  Targets are extremely important in options not to get awestruck by the possibility of 1000s of % return on $50-$100 input."

     "This is what going long feels like. At some point when you spent almost $1m on NVIDIA you should have hear the words in your head, 'I'm really fucking long NVIDIA' which should have made you think of a hedge against your longs. This is what long feels like. Short term ups and downs down bother people who are genuinely long. \n\nAs you probably now know, you should have hedged at $212.  You still can, but it's not as pretty as you are 22% below entry price. \n\n**Hedge:** Sell the $200 October call for $17. Buy the December $150 put for $18. Sell the December $110 for $8.00\n\nYou receive $8 in net premium. With the put, you are now protected from further downside at $150. \n\n**If Nvidia goes to $110,** your new max loss is going to be your cost basis of $200- $150 executed put + $8 premium which is a $42 loss. And you re-enter in December at $110. Better than $200 - $110 which is a $90 loss. \n\n**If Nvidia stays at $165** in October you just get kept $8 and you've also had insurance the whole time and you can ride it back up. \n\n**If Nvidia recovers to over $200 in October**, you are selling out at $200 via the call, but get to keep the $8 net premium and thankful that you rode out of it alive. \n\nYou can adjust any of these numbers to your sweet-spot of risk/protection/reward by just changing the strikes. There are two fundamentals here. \n\n1) You use the calls to finance the puts\n\n2) You are selling a put in later months (calendar spread) to help finance the purchase of puts in early months as that gets better premium and if you are long NVIDIA, re-entering at a new lower price in later months should not bother you. \n\nGood luck."

Shoot holes in my plan. \\n\\n\\nWhat are potential downfalls to this strategy? I understand that if the price sky rockets I could miss out on those profits which is why I only plan on selling 1 covered call for each. If the price falls thats ok I still own the premium. Best case is that it missed the strike by $1, I keep the premium and the long position gains. \\n\\nThanks for any advice!'",

     "Think about it this way: Owning stock long term in growth companies gives you most of your return through the increase in the stock price. Those increases happen in ways and at times that you can't predict. They usually happen quite quickly. Lets say you bought FB in the past month at 188: \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png](https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png)\n\nYou figured it's basically a value stock at this point. You know many folks think it'll go up, but you don't think it will for some time. You sell covered calls at a strike of 200 and earn the premium. It pops up to 229 as it has in the past few weeks. Your shares are called away and you miss out on a 29 per share increase in the stock price. \n\nYou made a small premium, but missed out on a big jump. That jump could have happened after your covered call expiry, in which case you'd win. But it didn't. \n\nIf you're selling covered calls on growth stocks, you're going to make more premium but you're going to miss out on bigger growth opportunities. \n\nIf you sell covered calls on value stocks that tend to trade within a tight band, you won't make much premium because the implied volatility is so low - so even though the likelihood of the stock increasing is much lower, so is the amount you earn from selling a covered call option. \n\nSelling covered calls also adds complexity and costs. So if I was you, I'd consider buying and holding long term and actually benefit from the growth in stock, instead of selling away that growth for a small premium. That way you keep the growth opportunity for yourself, without any costs other than the original transaction fee for the stock purchase. \n\nThere's another factor that your options premiums are taxed as short term capital gains - in other words, ordinary income. If you hold a stock for longer than a year, not only do you benefit from the growth, but your gains are taxed as long term capital gains. \n\nThe problem is that this approach requires patience, a willingness to defer gratification, which is difficult for most people, and does not involve much trading activity, which is also a problem for folks who want to think of themselves as \"traders\". \n\nYMMV. This is not tax advice or investment advice."

     "First off, this is awesome - these are the exact posts I think truly help benefit the sub. People thinking through approaches well in advance and optimizing. Good on you. Onto your Q:\n\n>My plan is to sell 1 covered call for each of these 15-20% OTM at probably 1 month out (avoiding months with earnings months). Shoot holes in my plan.\n\nI think this is a great start to a plan but requires quite a bit more detail. It looks like some of it is implicit for you in your second paragraph but I'll mention some of the things I'm thinking about anyways in case you hadn't considered them:  \n\\-Will you sell below your basis? If so, how would you deploy (how far below your basis, DTE, return requirements, etc)?  \n\\-If not, is the plan to simply hold the stock? What's the downside risk management plan? Even if you intend to hold these forever, things change so it's still good practice to think through how you'd unwind in the worst case scenario.   \n\\-NVDA pays a small dividend, does this factor into the plan at all?   \n\\-Are you looking for any specific balance between these three? Rebalancing plans? \n\nA few initial thoughts for discussion, hope one or two of these may be useful."

     "Problem is, when they run, they run.  I have/had four stocks I wish I never wrote calls on.  The run ups far outweigh what any premiums were collected.   The first was MSFT which was stuck in the twenties years ago.  I had about 500 shares off and on, wrote calls, sold puts, collected divvies, all good until Balmer was booted and replaced.  Then the stock went on a tear and I couldn\u2019t keep up trying to roll the calls. Soon it was in the forties, then fifties, etc. Now $300 a share.   I bought 2000 shares of MOS about 3\\~4 years ago after the sell off,  selling puts and calls when it was bouncing around back in the low twenties and mid teens.  I thought it was a really good trading stock for options.  The income was good.  Did ok.  Then it started to move.  Almost hit $70 recently.  I still have the calls in the low 30\u2019s but missed out on about $80k of profit.  Had 1500 of OXY in the low teens and got called away in the low $30\u2019s.   I have a $310 June call on COST.  It moved too fast to roll up.  Still hasn\u2019t been called away, now collecting puny divs.  That\u2019s almost $28k in lost profit.  Very annoying to say the least.  AMZN and Google I would accumulate.  Write puts instead."

     "OK here it goes.  I would assume you are around you phone or computer full time to be trading options.\n\nApril 29 Contract date (GOOG $3,100 strike = 21.00) (AMZN $3,700 strike = 30.00) (NVDA $315 strike = 5.76)\n\nGOOG - selling 7 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $700 per month. \n\nAMZN - selling 8 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $1,200 per month\n\nNVDA - selling 6 cc's will bring in $3,420 per month\n\nSelling 1 GOOG or AMZN cc will be a giant waste of time.  Take some more time and learn and practice selling covered calls so you feel comfortable selling all 7 or 8 contracts.   You will need some liquidity, but here is my opinion.\n\nSell the April 29 contracts with strike as noted above.  Wait a little while after the split, because chances are, the stock will initially rip up before it settles into a normal pattern.  If the stock goes up, roll over your calls to a later date. If stock trades sideways, the time element is on your side. If stock drops, you can but back your contract for a bargain and repeat. (or just let die worthless and do again)  As long as you have liquidity, you can continue to roll over. \n\nNVDA is a different animal. Due to it's volatility, this stock will bring in premium.  Again, as long as you have liquidity, you can sell cc's and roll over those calls should the stock price rise substantially.  If trades sideways, you buy back cheap and repeat, or hold until contract is worthless.   \n\n\nI honestly don't worry about being assigned.  If the contract goes in the money, there's no guarantee you will be assigned.  I neve have been. I recently have a June 17th $150 call trading at $185 and I just bought back the contract for $5,500, pushed back the strike date a month and sold another for $5,500 increasing the strike price to $180.\n\nIf, for some reason you get assigned, just buy back the stock. If you let it get to a spot where it's well over your strike price, shame on you. \n\nThe downside is, you are a long term holder of stock. So pick companies you believe in for the long run.\n\nAs for BABA situation, hopefully people were selling calls on the way down. When it rips up 30%, you roll over.  \nRemember, each time you sell a contract, you put premium in your account.  And each time a contract expires, that premium is yours. \n\nYou don't always have to be ITM, as long as you have the liquidity to roll over. Roll over on the way up, take premium on the way down"

Your protected both sides. If it goes up the 270 280 will cover your 280/290 credit spread.  If it goes down you keep the credit.  If it goes up to 280 you make another 1k then lose 100 dollars of that for every dollar it goes above 280.  So if you turned into a butterfly you would collect about $400 in credit.  So instead of losing 875 you\u2019d only lose 475 if it doesn\u2019t go to 270."

     "This isn't as simple as it sounds, sometimes a loss is just a loss, BUT, the question of whether you think NVDA will head, especially considering earnings are coming up? If you're still bullish on it,, you can offset some of the risk by selling a higher value call (you need to be approved for spreads by your broker). If you're not sure the market will support NVDAs move up, you need to look at unwinding on a green day. Earnings should be nice, but NVDA had a high beta, so it's fairly sensitive to market movements. If the whole market is sht, then it shouldn't fare much better, regardless of earnings. Goodness forbid the earnings are not stellar, it will be crushed. So again, you really have to decide whether you think the price is going to move this week. You're somewhat far on the weekly range, so don't take anyone touting the stick or putting it down in reddit seriously, but make your own decision.\nNot advice, just some ranting!"

Question for the experienced here, should I be conservative and sell it for some small profit here before the Feb 16 earnings report, or is there reason to feel secure that it'll jump up and give me solid returns right before it expires? I won't lie, I dont have a ton of money set aside for investing and I kinda yolo'd a large percentage of that on this one call. I was sweating when it went in the red for a good while right after I bought, but its doing well now. I didnt go cheap, I bought what was just barely OTM at the time and I thought 255 was a very reasonable goal. Thoughts?"

I said watch it rip over 1% to go into a holiday weekend. It did. My justification for NOT playing, I do index fund investing with about 65% SP 500, 35% small/mid caps. I'm getting those gains, so why Gamble and get greedy."

But I\u2019m not at my computer to look at IV rank.\n\nOne of the ways I explained to a friend when looking at options of $4-500 stocks (he was appalled by the premiums) is to just imagine it\u2019s a $100 stock and do some simple math on some contracts. \n\nEx. the 6/16 450C is 7.65. That\u2019s a 4% move. Now let\u2019s just divide by 4 to get the stock closer to a hundred. But we\u2019ll also do the same with that options premium, and we get a $108 stock with an option that cost $1.9 for a 4% move expiring post ER. That doesn\u2019t seem bad. If we look at the 6/9s that don\u2019t cover the ER, pricing seems pretty normal. An AMZN contract 4% otm expiring this week cost .2. An Adbe contract 4% otm cost .84. But remember adbe is almost 4x the cost/share. So just divide by 4 (basically think of it as if they were to do a split). Adbe would be $108, with a .21 contract for a call 4% otm."

Obviously I am very bullish on the semi-conductor play.

I bought a leap for NVDA well before the stock split, and now, after selling off 2/5 of my options on the way up, I have 3 left. They are NVDA Jun17'22 175.0 Call(s).  \\nNeedless to say, it has been gut-wrenching watch NVDA step lower and lower over the last month. I have lost 50% profits on these calls. Don't ask me why I didn't sell when NVDA hit 330. I just thought I had time, and each few days, NVDA stepped lower. Now that earnings are smashing the market (sorry NFLX) it feels like NVDA is suffering a similar fate.  \\nThe only silver lining is that they are still very profitable considering my base investment. My question is now, what do I do? Do I roll the options up? Do I hold onto them since they are less volatile than OTM calls? Do I just give up and sell it entirely?  \\n  \\nReally appreciate everyone's insight.\"",

Like the other reply that noted that the bid was 419.38 for less than 10 seconds, less time than it takes to enter or adjust an order.\n\nIf (a) the bid was above your cost basis, and (b) you entered a correct limit order to sell to close at the bid (for example, if the bid is nickel increment, you set a multiple of $.05 as the limit, not $.69), and (c) the bid stayed at that price or higher for the entire time your order was put together, submitted, and went live, and (d) the quantity of your order did not exceed the quantity of the NBBO, it's very hard to believe you would not be insta-filled. All sorts of things would have to parlay to have your order hang fire, like some higher priority order got in front of you and took all the quantity at that price, if not swept the entire order book."

I have the same concerns, about losing it all, so what I have done is I set my max amount used for colleterial is 120K, worse case I lose the 120K, it would suck but I still have more than I started with.   I roll any spreads in the money at least a day before, or even earlier if way in the money.  I also try to collect 20/25% return on the money, but I am also going max 10 days out.  SPY almost did catch me last week when it spiked up over 420, had a lot of 416/417 calls so I just rolled them out, either for a small credit or small lose.  I will just make less money for that week, recent avg have been10k a week, this past week only 2k.  I been playing it close on the call side, sometimes I add puts sometimes not, sometimes I add the puts the day before if I get the strikes and premiums I want.  Right now, with this debt limit mess been very cautious when doing the put side.

There are strategies, however, that have a much higher probability of showing profits prior to expiration that take trades away from an even expectation. So you can consistently profit with options by managing your winners and losers appropriately. \n\nGiven that, your concern should be about how you mitigate losses with the 10% of the losers. But honestly, if you\u2019ve got a 90% probability of a 20% profit, even if your 10% probability ends up with an 80% loss every time, you\u2019re going to end up winning and you should be focused on getting as much volume as humanly possible."

That's probably reflective of two things, the first is that overall market volatility is much lower now (VIX \\\\~22). And somewhat related, these company's expected moves are now isolating their own earnings as opposed to picking up the uncertainty of other companies and the overall market. More than 90% of the other companies have already reported, including many of their peers. This is probably as pure an earnings reaction move as we've seen since the Covid selloff.\\n\\nLet me know in the comments if you'd like to see anything added.\\n\\n**Last Week**\\n\\n* VIX closed Friday at 22.05, down slightly on the week and the lowest level since the Spring.\\n* Last week's expected move in SPY +/- 1.2%\\n* Last weeks actual \"",

     "\\[being stupid playing with options\\]\n\nFirst, you have to admit to yourself you were gambling in either how or what you were trading to lose this amount in such a short time.  There are many ways to trade options with defined or limited risks, but you either don't know how to do this or went with undefined risk strategies to cause this high of a loss in one week . . .\n\nUnless you know what you did wrong and how to trade in a way that won't make things worse, then it seems you have to quit or you will continue to gamble.  You will feel worse if you turn a 150K loss into a larger one.\n\nI've been suggesting to many new traders to read an excellent book titled **Trading in the Zone by Douglas**.  In this book he talks about emotions, discipline, planning and having a winning attitude.\n\nDownload the book and read it this weekend as I suspect you will have a different view of things come Monday morning.\n\nCandidly, many new traders lose their house payment money gambling on options, so you are lucky in that you have a great job and high net worth, and at your age have plenty of time to make a lot more money.  Not your finest moment this week, but you will get past it and move on.  Just don't make it worse if you don't know what you're doing . . ."

As always thank you for all the comments!!**\\n\\nProof of ownership:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6xdq96e30ya1.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8a60dd672024b70d923b2c54687276c3ff0920f'",

     "Theta decay that helps short options like CCs profit ramps up over the last 60 days, so it doesn't make sense to sell so far away.\n\nLooking at a 49 dte 305 CC would bring in about $8.65 or $865.  \n\nAssuming the above example could be traded every 45ish dte for about $850 each time it would bring in about $7650 over the same time as the JUN 24 call (that you found out you have to hold to expiration to make the full profit).  \n\nTrading every 45ish dte will also let you move the strike price to move with the stock instead of locking down at $305.  If the stock moves up slowly then the CC strike can move up with it.  This can mean a lot more profit if the stock price moves up to $350 or $400.\n\nCCs is all about having theta decay work for you and the best way is to not sell past about 60 dte . . ."

Not by exercising, that\u2019s the wrong term, but by \u201cBuying to Close\u201d the option you \u201cSold to Open\u201d.   Effectively you would need to pay the premium you received originally (and likely much more, making this a losing trade) to repurchase and close the option contract you sold. \n\nSelling extremely long dated contracts nets a big premium because the extrinsic value values the anticipated growth of the underlying.

At the same time they are going to lose market share on the GPU front with Intel now starting to compete but overall bullish I\u2018d say.\n\nIntel trying to claw back trust and attacking consumer GPUs is interesting. If the rumored benchmarks turn out to be true and the price right, that\u2018s gonna be interesting to watch. \n\nAMD feels a bit sidelined at the moment. Not able to keep up with raytracing performance of the RTX, nobody cares about OpenCL for deep learning and their consumer GPUs aren\u2018t available to jump into the gap the RTX shortage created. Plus their \u201eprofessional\u201c GPUs are just embarrassing. HBM2 is nice and all but workstation GPUs with a max of 8GB VRAM? Please...\n\nThey\u2018re gonna do good on desktop and server Ryzens, though, so maybe slightly bullish?\n\nQualcomm, I have no idea.

     "   \n\nIntel post management changes and redefining their strategy in a era with a increased reliance on chips has the best upside risk/reward. This is a company that has been left for dead due to missteps and execution issues, but still is a significant player in a the CPU market as well as adjacent business including FPGA, AI, autonomous, 5G. The last five year revenue trends have been a record each year despite the world is ending thesis on Intel, yet the price underperformance and the hatred on the stock has maintained. While it may not have the limelight that other semiconductors get its a undervalued and potential momentum stock on the cusp of turning. New management combined with financial strength can highlight the reality that Intel existence is not on the line rather individual investors perception of the company is misaligned.\n\nIn addition, the product delays and node delays that get all the attention are very specific and case sensitive benchmarks. This does not mean there are performance questions that need to be addressed in the long run and with a technical focused management team and reliance on more customized solutions this can be addressed. The old days notions of processors simply being all about node size has evolved as many customers and clients look for customized solutions with integration into adjacencies including memory, gpu, fpga, AI which Intel has a portfolio to address. This also, includes other performance aspects including the packaging designs that Intel currently leads. To the average user they will not recognize the node their processor is running on or even how many cores it has (despite having a sticker saying dual core on their laptop). Also, Intel has always led in transistor density making their nodes on the \"same level\" as other competitors nodes a so called \"generation ahead\". In reality their 10nm performance is equivalent to competitors 7nm but the industry has evolved tremendously and a lot of other factors can impact performance. However, under new management hopefully a return to pleasing developers and the gamer community with events, and new products will return. This may help to blunt some of the negative press. It is also, important to note that the markets Intel operates in have a large and growing TAM often times and as a result there is room for competition; it is inevitable. Even Apple with a decades worth of the great unquestioned leadership in smartphones has competition and does not hold 100% of the smartphone market. After years of playing defense the other areas that Intel operates in have been grossly overlooked due to their lack of credibility with product delays on the CPU front. These include many bets in areas where the so called \"high flying innovative tech stocks\" operate in which include AI, machine learning, 5G, autonomous vehicles(Mobileye), FPGA and GPU. Intel has been and will continue to play offense on a lot of these fronts , but many investors do not care or highlight this since its always about nodes and nanometers. Despite being overlooked, these are the areas that can and will drive future growth and enable a lot of these technologies to work together offering customized solutions for clients. In return, it is critical from a stock perspective to see this as a opportunity to reassess the company and its valuation."

Last weeks volatile swings in the broader market were largely based on the wild swings in banks both large and small, with large bank Credit Suisse entering the conversation.

So, for your sake, and mine, I think it is important to keep talking about how the price will be favorable for new investors to gain positions on NVDA. \n\nShorts paid off on the predicted dip near the split, now it is time for the predicted bounce. REMEMBER, all the Long Callers for NVDA put their price targets in the range of 900-1000. Not to mention, NVDA is a solid company working on every front to expand and maintain production, even with chip shortages. \n\nHistory repeats...there is always a dip near Splits, at least for NVDA (they have had 4 of them), but the bounce back will happen much more quickly with NVDA this time around. There are a lot of heavy hitters that are about to take advantage of this recent dip. We should just enjoy the ride and take the gains!\n\nOne thing I've learned from NVDA trading, as small-time retail, is that I must be willing to endure the huge swings in price for their options because NVDA options ain't cheap!"

  "Text": "b\"19 FEB 2021 series expires in 3 days. And I was playing with the idea of a fast win on NVDA. So I'm analyzing shorting a vertical 595/585 put spread on nVidia which expires Friday with IV @ 52.23% ...\\n\\nIt would be a $4.10 credit spread, with $410.00 max profit OTM. Break-even price of $590.90, max loss would be $590.00.\\n\\nOpinions? I feel like it's a decent sized risk but has a fairly high chance of success. And if it does work out, $400+ in 3 days is pretty nice ... even half or a quarter of that is pretty nice. Probability analysis gives me about a 31.21% chance the trade actually loses money. And I'm feeling pretty bullish on nVidia both short and long term ...\"",

     "This close to expiration, your risk is very high, though if the current pre-market price holds, you'd be looking at perhaps a 60-70% probability of max profit (need to wait until the market opens to see how the position P/L changes). Your breakeven price is around $591, which is pretty decent. The odds are in your favor currently. What happens over the next 3 days is anyone's guess, so be prepared for a max loss on the position if the market takes any kind of downturn, even a 1-2% mini-correction in NDX. These types of trades are best kept small, and shouldn't be used for making any significant returns on your account overall. I've done hundreds of these kinds of short-term plays, and while the probability seems like it's on your side, the reality is that those probabilities don't take into account any *unpredictable* external events. This is why we love giving a trade time. Bull put spreads placed 30-45 days till expiration have a much larger safety net due to time being on your side in case a downward move occurs.\n\nIn any case, if you do open the position, I wish you luck."

Pretty low hit rate! \n\nE.g. On June 17 2022, HCP220617P00030000 was 2.75x3.40 when underlying was 26.34. So that's a free 26 cents: buy the put and buy the stock.

     "If you are determined to retain ownership of the stock, then you will treat the covered call writing as equivalent to someone who is writing naked calls.  What will happen is you will always attempt to roll out and move to higher strike prices so that you don't have to buy back the written call at a loss.  The problem is that NVDA tends to make most of its gains in spurts just like when it went from 110 to 180 from Oct to Dec.  Then is went from 140 to the current price of 191 in one month.  You will experience lots of frustrations and fear of missing out on the potential gains.  I would personally just let it get assigned and let the stock get called away.  You will have $16,500.  I would then use $6,400 to buy 19 JAN 2024 150 call for $64.00 ($23 extrinsic value and $41intrinsic value).Then immediately sell a 17 MAR 23 195 call for $14 against it ($14 extrinsic value and $0 intrinsic as of this writing).  This will reduce your cost to $5,000.  This is an ITM diagonal spread  which should have approximately a net +40 delta (long and short combined).  This will pay for more than half of the extrinsic value on the JAN 2024 150 call that you purchased.  I would just keep rolling this every 30 days ($6-7 of premium for a 30 delta call) and eventually you will end up with a Jan 2024 Bull Call Spread when you get to the final month and you can exercise the Jan 2024 150 strikes should owning NVDA still be your goal.  By doing it this way you can adjust the strikes on the calls you write every 30 days, which can offer downside protection from the juicy premiums should NVDA trend lower, as opposed to being tied up to something for 12 months and you are stuck with the $29 premium from the LEAPS you wrote.  \n\nEdit: You will have $11,500 left over.  You can use $11,000 to invest in other opportunities.  Then you can send $500 to me via Paypal friends and family. Haha."

If somebody wants to exercise the 500 calls, you would pay out the dividend, but you can either exercise your call (to cover your short) or you can sell your 480 call and buy NVDA stock in the open market (to cover your short).\n\nBTW, it is UNLIKELY that the October 500 call is going to be exercised even though it is deep in the money. The calls are about $59 bid to $61 offer. The underlying is about $538 per share. The dividend is only 16 cents per share. Not optimal to exercise the deep in the money call for the dividend.\n\nRobinhood probably has a standard blast email that they send to everybody. However, it is to their BENEFIT for you to unwind the position before it goes ex-dividend so they can get payment for order flow. Thus, it is obviously not to your benefit to unwind the spread before NVDA goes ex-dividend."

     "As earnings approach, the IV of the options slowly increase. This inflates the extrinsic value of the option, sometimes by quite a bit. This effect usually peaks just before the close of the last day before earnings are reported. In fact, some people buy options a few weeks before earnings just to 'ride the swell' and sell out right before earnings. \n\nWhen the market opens the day after earnings, the IV will be absolutely crushed, which will dramatically reduce the extrinsic value of that option.\n\nThis means that the stock will have to make a significant move upward just to counteract the IV crush. It is not unusual for the stock to move in the correct direction, but the option still loses value. If, for some reason, the market is not satisfied with the earnings report, the stock price may fall and you'll get doubly screwed.\n\nThat's why holding options through earnings is always a gamble, even when the company is solid.\n\nIf it was me, I would sell out about 3pm tomorrow, hopefully at a profit. Then if you are still bullish after earnings, buy back in."

     "If you own at least 100 shares of NVDA, and you sold a 195 covered call for $63, another alternative to earn $50-100 per month is selling out of the money call credit spreads on NVDA.  For example sell 1 Dec 23 195 Call for .79 and buy 1 for Dec 23 205 Call for .28 for a credit of $51. The short 195 call has a delta of 10 so a 10% chance of being in the money. Your risk is $949 which sounds high but it is off set by your stock in your portfolio so you\u2019ll just be flat from 195-205 (gain from the stock pays for the credit spread loss) should NVDA go to 195 or higher in the next two weeks. At above 205 your profit will start to rise again should NVDA close above 205 in two weeks. With this strategy you don\u2019t have to worry about any assignment for whatever your reason is for not wanting to sell the stock. If NVDA closes below 195 by 12/23, you don\u2019t have to do anything and you keep the premium.  If NVDA closes at 220, for example, your underlying would have gained $5k but your credit spread would have lost $949 but your are still positive $4k.  At least you don\u2019t have the possibility of being assigned and having to sell NVDA and pay taxes or whatever your reason is for not wanting to liquidate.  Just repeat selling the 10 deltas every two weeks and you can gain $100 a month.  Just my two cents.  I\u2019m sure there are other options traders with better ideas.\n\nEdit: Actually with a covered call you are capped out at whatever call strike you sold.  For example, if NVDA closes at 250 but you sold the 195 strike you make  $2,500 max plus credit (170-195) but the call buyer makes the difference from 195-250 minus the premium.  With this strategy, you continue to make money above 205 since you will be long 205 calls.  This strategy is better for unanticipated huge moves."

     "Holy crap. Stop trying to show off, and go learn how to calculate gains...\n\nYour 1700% gain calculation makes absolutely no sense. **You got about a 15% return.** (which is pretty lame, btw, for the risk you took on an earnings play in which you were perfectly right on direction...)\n\nYour calculation is just wrong. \n\n- First reason - it makes no sense to divide the profit by the initial debit or credit, which is what you did to get to 1700% return. Think about it - it's perfectly possible to open trades with $0 change in cash. Eg, sell an option for $1, buy another different option for $1. Net, your debit, or credit, is $0. If you made $0.01 on that trade, would you claim that you made +Inf%? That's one reason why your calculation is nonsense.\n\n- Second reason - in your calculation, you assumed that you earned around $800 by \"investing\" around $40. But in reality, if you deposit $40 with a broker and try to open such a position, the broker will laugh at you and tell you to come up with more cash. You can only open such a position with *more* than $5k in your account. That means that you got $800 return on an investment of $5k. That's around 15% (with commissions and fees).\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you risked at least $5k to make a tiny bit of money. In reality, you actually risked considerably more than $5k, because the contracts have different expirations.\n\nThis is a play that is worth a lot of praise over at /r/wallstreetbets .\n"

Currently the price of the ATM straddle is $31.60, if you believe NVDA should move more than $31.60 in either direction, then buying the straddle would make sense.\n\nIf you want to close the trade Thursday morning, then you want NVDA to move more than the expected move from their earnings. The expected move is around $30. If you believe NVDA can move more than $30 after earnings, buying a straddle would make sense.\n\nTL;DR: buying a straddle for earnings is a coin flip.

I'm starting to read more about the selling volatility side of options trading and am intrigued by some of your posts, and want to learn more, esp some of the lingo.\n\nCan you tell if I'm getting this right?\n\nSo you're selling an iron condor, betting that either the price doesn't move too much in either direction or hoping that the IV crush after earnings depreciates whatever side of the IC enough for you to buy that side back with minimal loss (or even a slight profit).\n\nHow do you calculate 59% POP (that's prob of profit right?)\n\nWhat do you mean by 'stayed on the dance floor'? Does that mean inside the middle max profit area of the IC? And then the way the play ended, you canceled your 25% buy back because you saw you had a chance to let both sides expire worthless and maximize profit, but then in Edit 2, NVDA started to move and you bought back one side for a $20 debit, is that right?\n\nThanks for your help in advance"

     "I think if you understand the risks of holding a LEAP compared to just owning the underlying, then buying a LEAP can be a good way to get some leverage.\n\nOne thing I do is to figure out the break even point between going long on the underlying verses buying the LEAP. Here it's about 185. Then I compare that to my target price and see if the risk of losing the entire value of the LEAP is worth the leverage that I gain with the LEAP. If your target price is 200 for Jan 2019? That'd be less than 2x leverage and personally that wouldn't be enough for me to risk losing 100% if the stock either stays flat, goes down, or only goes up modestly, and I'd just buy $2500 worth of NVDA. If you think it's realistically going to go to 300 or 400? Then that would be a good reason to do a LEAP.\n\nAlso plan ahead what to do if the trade goes against you since the leverage works both ways. If the stock drops next earnings and the LEAP loses 50% of its value, what are you going to do?\n\nOne thing to watch out for is the bid/ask spread. Here the ask is 24.25, but the bid is 25.70, so if you out in an order to buy at 24.25 it's probably not going to get filled. You can inch a limit order through the spread in increments of .05 or .1 and try to get filled at less than 25.70, but there's no guarantee. This will also work the other way when you're looking to sell, so it's going to cost you an additional $50 or $100 on both ends of the transaction."

Your proposed trade looks like it touches on both mistakes. The bid/ask spread with the market closed is showing $2420 bid $2570 ask. That's $150 (or $75 if you fill at the mid) you'll never get back, and also a similar bid/ask when you try to exit. So your paying approximately $150 in friction. If you do market orders maybe more like $300 on a $2400 investment (more of a gamble really).\n\nThird thing, always have a plan before you get in.

As long as you roll for a credit then you can't make a bad play. \n\n> (4) hope for a slight dip, repeat until I get back on track\n\n(R4) An issue I've come across with trying to help people with covered calls is getting them to understand that the underlying running through their short strike isn't a bad thing, as long as you always roll for a credit; the problem occurs when you buy back the ITM call and sell the OTM call for a debit.\n\n> (5) Should I just be happy with my gains and repeat the madness, this time with a deeper OTM call?\n\n(R5) Yes you should be happy. With something like $NVDA there is extrinsic even in the deep ITM calls you have a few options (i) close out the position for a profit (ii) roll the position to the same strike and just keep burning off extrinsic while reducing your basis (iii) roll up and out for a credit. Your choice should be based on your commission rate and whether or not you think you could be using the capital more effectively. \n\nCongrats on the winner and good luck with your trading\n"

I was very happy with the results I had because I don't think I could have stomached the results in a purely unhedged long stock. At each point, I continued to learn how to manage a CC on a \"rocket stock\" which was new to me and I was more concerned with the downside than the upside at the time.\n\nI digress. Remember that you're selling volatility and that cuts both ways, sad when upside volatility pays better than you priced it and even more sad when downside volatility pays better than you priced it.\n\nA covered call strategy often doesn't beat just holding long stock over the long term. It does often achieve a better reward/risk ratio. Investing/trading/money management returns are more about risk management than absolute returns, in my mind.\n\nI really value consistent, repeatable, profitable performance over big wins. I never feel jealous over some guy that bought calls on a stock and made a 400% return. I know that if he isn't keeping his position sizes down that he's probably a one-trick pony that's out of the game very soon.

Strangle sellers may be reluctant after big losses in the past.\n\nAgain for the many beginners reading, straddle buyers are predicted to win about 1/3 of the time. This is basic theory based on market expectations. Market participants are guessing at the expected move, and may be wrong. However, over a large number of occurrences, results tend to be close to theory.\n\nEdit.. KISS may be worth exploring. I could not make head or tail of your current position. Keep it simple.\nNoob mistake #4 is adding complexity. If a person can't make money with simple trades, complexity only tends to add costs.\n\nNumber 1 mistake is trading too big.  2 is trading illiquid products. 3 failure to plan before getting in. 4 adding complexity."

Your assumption has changed. I doubt you would get any credit for a roll. However, you could try to salvage some losses by selling a put spread *in the same expiration*. Whatever premium you receive will not cost you additional buying power, at least.\n\nIf put spread premium is garbage, take a loss (if not at a max yet) and close.

     "First lets talk about why you want to make a change at all. A perfectly sound strategy would be to just continue to hold, or DCA and buy more shares at discounted prices, and wait another 10 years for things to average out. I'm not saying you have to do that, but I am asking why you decided not to. What has changed? Why do you think a pivot is necessary?\n\nThose aren't rhetorical questions. The answers are important to understand what the root cause is. Crafting a strategy without understanding what is motivating it is a recipe for making a bad decision/strategy.\n\n-------------------\n\nFor the sake of argument, I'll assume the reason is that you have discovered and gone beyond your risk tolerance. If that's not the reason, ignore the rest of this section.\n\nThe best thing to do, all things considered, is to rebalance your portfolio to lower its risk profile. That necessarily means selling some of your shares. You can tax manage that somewhat if you can select tax lots individually, but one way or the other, you are going to realize gains/losses and have tax impacts. However, I think you will find that the net net of all those tax impacts will cost you less in the long run than any kind of adventure into options and hedging.\n\nYou don't have to sell all your shares all at once. You can do a gradual reduction of risk by diversifying. And you can sell some of the losers to cancel out some gains on sales of the winners. You should probably dump all the losers regardless to free up capital for diversification.\n\nNow, how to diversify. That depends a lot on your time horizon and investment goals, but the general idea is to move your overweight in Tech towards the broader world-wide equity market, and add bonds and commodities to dilute the concentration of risk correlation in your current portfolio. 60/40 world equities/world bonds is a decent eventual asset mix to shoot for, but use an interactive asset mix calculator to find the mix that fits your goals best. I link a few below and the first link is the one I use myself.\n\nFor now, you can start slow by selling all your losers and however much of your winners net to zero cap gains after selling the losers, and use the freed up cash to buy VTI. That's only the US equity market, but it's a good place to start. If you want to go 60/40 VTI/BND, that would be fine too. Both are deeply discounted vs. 15 year averages right now, so you'll be getting bargain prices.\n\nYou can read more about asset class diversification and portfolio asset mix here:\n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio\n\nAsset allocation calculators:\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation\n\nhttps://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculator\n\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/overview"

Tax loss harvesting\n\n2.) Use correlations to your advantage. For example, DXY and rates going up clobbers tech, so positions that profit in such an environment are a hedge against your current PF.\n\n3.) Short correlated indices using futures or ETFs. SQQQ, SARK,NOPE on the long side or short QQQ, ARKK, GK directly and use the cash to buy short term Tbills.\nTheres an \"Inverse Cramer\" ETF coming online next month.\n\n\nFortunately tech pays shit dividends so its a lot easier to short it and short term rates are high so you have some structural advantage here that we didnt have for a long time.\n\n\nSo step one would be harvest as much tax loss as you can and figure out how much gains you can net out.

     "Vega tends to be higher on larger underlyings therefore you must becareful of volatility risk when you trade long options. Generally, long calls will tend to make money on delta not vega. Long puts makes money on vega and delta. Vega or volatility tends to increase when the share price drops and decreases when the share price increases or goes up. \n\nFor example if you have been trading amazon short puts, you\u2019ll end up with many Porsche cars and a few houses. Why? Probability of short puts are higher than long calls. 1. You collect short vega when the share price increases and if it stays otm, you collect full credit. If you don\u2019t have $20,000 laying around, to reduce long call risk, you can simply buy a back month itm call and sell a front month otm call or a poor mans covered call. You\u2019ll get long theta, long vega and long delta, or if you don\u2019t have that capital laying around. Simply buying a bull call or selling a bull put will atleast hamper some long call risk by hedging with a higher strike short call or if you sell a credit spread and if it stays otm you collect full premium.

How high could this go?! \n\nI ended up staring at it for 15 minutes as the ticker price bar coded sideways then dropped a little. I ended up selling around the 1.80ish range.\n\nIt really wasn't the small price drop that hurt the value of the contracts... it was when the IV (implied volatility) dried up from the sideways price action. Best I can figure is, if IV is 400-500% and the price action is starting to taper off its probably time to sell before IV crush happens. Or sell part of your position and leave a few contracts floating \"just in case\" but locking in most of your gains is important. Fighting that greed isn't easy.\n\nIt's great you're buying close to the money but as far as weekly contracts go, I've never had any luck holding past Wednesday. \n\nJust some thoughts from my own experience. It sounds like your doing better than I am as far as wins. Maybe just keep an eye on the IV and see if it doesn't help quell that urge to hold out for more."

But once again, because the move was to the upside, combined with most of the big cap earnings, the election, the FOMC decision, and CPI now behind us, vol continues to move lower. The VIX is now 22.5. Down from 34 in October. That declining vol has not been a reaction to options overpricing moves over the past month. In fact, the opposite has been true. What it is a sign of is worries of a crash, or continued move lower in the market, whether it be FOMC, Earnings, Election, or inflation data-driven, is now less of a likelihood in the near term.

I compare the current situation to the June CPI were we tanked hard before. After inflation had not peaked, that killed the bull thesis imo for the next few months. 100bps started getting priced in so now there\u2019s fear. What I think will happen is that Jpow says 75bps, we rally hard, remember it\u2019s always the first few moves that are the fake one, and then dump the next day as it is also VIX expiration. He could also mention that they will consider 100bps so i\u2019m going to be extra cautious if there\u2019s like 2-3 fake out moves. \n\nwill be monitoring how much 100bps is priced in and going to be on the look out for CPI leaks\n\nI am also jacked to the tits on Monday and Wednesday puts that I bought on Friday.

If you\u2019re trading XSP the bid/ask can be wide so plan on closing out trades manually at the midpoint.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the futures market instead for options best to start small with MES as it\u2019s as liquid as SPY.  I never found 0DTE with futures very profitable strategy wise.  SPY works best in a tax deferred account like an IRA rather than a cash account.  I tend to trade section 1256 eligible options in my cash account with margin.  The slippage on XSP does add up but the 60/40 tax structure makes up for it."

In most cases, options do not qualify for wash sales when using different stikes and dates, but this is up to the broker.  \n\nMy question to you in this situation is are you concerned if you could not write off a $100 loss on your 2022 taxes and might have to wait until your 2023 taxes?  \n\nWash sales are one of the most misunderstood aspects of trading.

How did you select strikes (what delta?) and what DTE?\n\nI'm not a fan of rolling for the sake of rolling. You need to have ever increasing confidence in the probability and size of profit to roll. Like if your original goal was a 70% chance to make $100, if you roll, you need to have an 80% chance to make $120 (net of the loss on the roll, so if you opened for a $100 credit then had to pay $169 to close for a -$69 loss, you have to make $189 on the new contract to net a $120 credit on the roll), and if you roll again, a 95% chance to make $150 (net net).\n\nMore about rolling here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourroll"

Also, they are volatile and move well in both directions with NVDA being the easier of the two to trade.  \\n\\nIf you have been losing money trading options because of volatility, getting shaken out, stress, etc then the following strategy may help.  Determine the latest hot sector of the market i.e. energy, financials, retail, etc and trade options in the corresponding ETF.

With the Arm deal falling through in February, only negative triggers seem to remain to reinforce the current downtrend: worsening macroeconomic conditions, FED rate hikes, potential stock dilution later this year, ETH switching to proof-of-stake which may hit GPU demand, slowing consumer demand for GPUs... The stock has been hitting the key $210 support level multiple times this year already, and its valuation is still extremely high. Its price-to-sales ratio stands at 20, still much higher than its pre-pandemic peak of 15 and the industry average (AMD P/S is 7 for instance). Same is true for its P/E ratio of 56.

Don\u2019t pick these randomly or in haste because of falling stock price pain.\n\nBe ready (& be able) to actively manage/adjust the position.\n\nClose the trade (buy back the calls) BEFORE they expire. \n\nNo matter how unlikely something might seem, a few pennies/dollars is NOT worth an unpleasant surprise at 0DTE or a few days from expiry. This was a lesson I had to learn the hard way even after being taught to know better. \n\n\u201cMost calls expire worthless\u201d is a saying that gets echoed, but that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. \n\nYou (& every other option buyer/seller out there) have the ability to close (i.e. Sellers can buy back & Buyers can sell) a trade at any point before expiry. Hopefully this provides enough context to understand the point. \n\nBuying/Selling calls does NOT mean you\u2019re stuck in your choice until expiration. Options offer tremendous flexibility & leverage. Learning to use them properly & responsibly takes time & focus. It\u2019s worth learning.\n\n30-45 days is considered by many to \nbe about the right amount of time to sell options in most situations.\n\nContext & conditions matter. Things can change quickly and big moves can happen when you least expect them. \n\nHave a plan. I know, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face\u2014it\u2019s still better to have one than not. \n\nBe especially careful taking advice from anyone claiming a trade like this is simple/easy. It\u2019s your money and NOBODY will care about it the way that you do. \n\nI paid for an options course (which included an active trader community) a while back that was actually really great. If you\u2019re planning to place many of these trades over time, it\u2019d definitely be worth considering some help like that."

Find good companies with strong moats and strong leadership - buying back stock is also something I would look for (AMD, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Meta, VTI)\n2. Buy shares with all your disposable income for the next decade. Try and buy on dips when possible. Don\u2019t be Cathie wood. Only buy with money you don\u2019t need for 10x years. \n3. Don\u2019t waste time staring at your account. Check in every now and then but don\u2019t do anything. Just buy dips when you can. And re-invest all dividends. \n4. Focus your time on work and creating value for yourself. Don\u2019t waste time trying to time the market or dwelling on paper losses or gains. \n5. In 10x years, your account will have tripled (at least) and you can start taking some off the top to buy shares in up and coming great companies. Hold those, don\u2019t sell, and check it again it 10 years. Rinse and repeat. \n\nNever buy options. Don\u2019t panic and sell. Just add and hold, has worked for the last 100 years and will work for the next 100 years unless there is a nuclear war and if that happens who cares, we are all fucked."

Everything was going great, at one point my cost basis was down to $15.50 and I was up like 40%. And then the Russian bs happened. I have no idea why I didnt sell other than outright greed. The week before I had finished doing the math and calculated that with about 50 trades, maxing out margin, and earning about $0.30 per trade with Aal, I could more or less 4-5x my money.

For those who are discussing averaging down by buying more LEAPS (which Im strongly considering given my faith in the underlying), pay attention to the IV in relationship to the underlying. AMD IV is high in relationship to where it typically is. If I understand this right, its a great time to sell opinions (CC) but buying options might be a little too expensive.

Because of put-call parity, the LEAPS call is equivalent to being long the stock and long the out of the money put at the same strike.\n\nBecause the downside protection is similar to that long-dated out of the money put, it provides very little protection on a price decline until the stock falls so far that it approaches the strike.\n\nLEAPS calls are frequently used to leverage up price exposure on a stock with limited capital.

You will speed up the recovery to your break even if the underlying keeps moving up.\n\nDetails here: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/repair-strategy.asp"

     "I have scanned these and it seems the consensus is hold, it'll come back.  None of us know that for sure.  Have you thought about just taking the loss now while it is still somewhat salvageable?  You've gone from ITM to OTM right quick and you have earnings coming up as well, which are typically crap shoots, especially lately.  Are you willing to hold if AMD sells off another 20%?  What's your exit plan in that scenario?  On the flip side, they could have killer earnings and your LEAPS go from red to breakeven, or even profitable overnight depending on how things shake out.  A lot of things to think about.\n\nThis is why I am thinking if you are going to run a covered call strategy, it seems almost worth it to be doing it with shares instead.  I understand the leverage aspect is taken away and the loss on shares is always 1:1 but on an option it can be buffered a bit.  The bonus with the shares is the time component is negated and you don't have a breakeven cost over the current cost you have to claw back.\n\nLots of thinking to do coming up."

I wouldn't even roll them, just buy new ones every two weeks (ie DCA) and ignore the old ones.  If your broker allows it set your existing LEAPS to auto sell.

I was basically selling Facebook and Nvidia puts and I was going to sell calls on them at around the same strike price or slightly lower. \\n\\nHowever the first week I did that I got assigned NVDA at 257.5$, and FB 225$. As you may know, NDA is now 160$\\n\\nMy FB is down too but not doing as bad; I am down 3k on the stock but was able to make 2k in premium, and will continue making some premium until it eventually gets called away. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure what to do as the best play. I\\'ve bought a short term lower strike price put to protect my NVDA from crashing \"too\" much, and I\\'m selling some calls but premiums around the prices of 250$ or even 240$ are basically null. \\n\\nShould I sell lower strike calls to try to make some premium (200-220$ strike) at the risk of getting it called away, or should I still sell (much) cheaper 250$ calls at basically almost no return'",

Did you try to roll the puts to get more premiums and delay assignments?  \n\nWhile the wheel works best in neutral and bullish markets, the worst that can happen is you end up owning some stocks you don't mind owning.\n\nNo one can know when the market or any stocks may rebound, so sit tight and hold these shares until they come back up.  We've seen markets tank like this and then move back up relatively fast sometimes.  \n\nIf your analysis on the stock is still positive, and you have the capital plus adding more shares would not make any stock too much risk to the account, then I will sometimes sell more puts to keep premiums coming in which lowers the net stock cost of the shares.  Rolling these to avoid assignment, but if assigned then this will average down the net stock cost quickly."

If you get assigned you own the stock at $90. \n\nThen you sell a call against your stock. It is a covered call which is the equivalent position to a synthetic short put.\n\nIf the underlying will trades sideways or up, then selling puts should work out (because your short options are going to expire worthless). If the underlying is going down, then this is a losing strategy because you are selling put options (or synthetic put options) on an asset that depreciates.\n\nIf you think about it this way, then the only time you would want to do this is when the underlying is going sideways or up. Right now, most underlyings (including the major indexes) all all going down. Thus, selling puts is not going to be the brightest thing to do."

     "Idk y u would think selling nvda calls at 250 makes any sense, as they r 90$ away from current price\u2026. I\u2019m not the smartest person in the room but u really really should be selling closer to 190-170$ strikes. Like r u even trying to make back ur lost money ? Or r u just selling calls for selling calls sake?. To me it doesn\u2019t make any sense to sell so out of the money. Just because ur assigned at 257.5 doesn\u2019t mean u have to sell around that. But that\u2019s just my opinion\u2026\n\n\nEdit: also looking at the nvda chart I see most of the drop is very recent, so maybe a little stupid of me to judge, but in my honest opinion we r not going to see any sort of massive rally for some time. I think there definitely will be a little bump up with in the next 2-3 weeks. But none of these big players r going more then 10% up and then slowly will fall again until a true bull catalyst comes, like Russia Ukraine ending, china lockdown ending or something else that is really big. So I\u2019d say go for 190 maybe 200$ strike for the 30-45 day but going any higher is a bit silly as, it\u2019s not really worth ur time. What I do is buy back the option at 50% profit and wait til a Green Day and sell again. But everyone has there own risk tolerance."

Im not an expert by any means, but especially in this market environment where I have been holding less, been putting more efforts/divesting in selling Puts during earnings releases.\\n\\nNote: I never ever buy calls/puts during earnings period (and never will).\\n\\nBeen doing very well and for instance this week, conservatively made a solid amount selling Zoom Puts (strike $60), Costco (strike $430), and NVDA (strike $130). In all cases, next morning close out for $.01-$.03 a share.\\n\\nSome of my criteria I use:\\n\\n1) Only sell contracts expiring that Friday\\n\\n2) Only do for earnings releases Wed/Thurs- as then close to the Friday expiry and goal is always to sell the next morning \\n\\n3) Of course, only for those stocks I would be happy to own (definitively) for the strike prices\\n\\n4) Dont get greedy and priced relatively far out (know of course exemplified ie FB, NFLX, ROKU, etc these days nothing is definitively far out)'",

     "Looks good. Seems as though you\u2019ve mapped out a trading plan and executing it. My one thought is selling naked on tickers like COST, NVDA, or other \u201chigher\u201d priced tickets presents fairly large downside risk. You made it clear you are aware of that by acknowledging the FB and NFLX earnings debacles. The questing I like to ask myself is can I handle assignment on my naked positions in the event of a black swan event? Can I simultaneously meet margin requirements in vol expansion cycle? Plan for the worst hope for the best. If properly managed early, and as long as there is enough time and extrinsic value you can roll those option from a credit perpetually to lower cost basis until profitable if your account size can facilitate that. However, in a serious draw down like in NLFX you could be left bag holding for quite a bit and have to sell covered calls against your stock position well below your basis. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware of all this just something to consider as with the recent market conditions and very volatile earnings as of late have resulted in massive moves in some underlying a where assignment is inevitable when that far in the money (assuming you don\u2019t want to roll for a large debit). Took some naked positions on higher price tickers and ended up holding after massive moves. Not unmanageable but certainly locks up your capital for longer than desired. Food for thought."

Volatility crush is also real for stock prices. But if you don\u2019t believe technical and you are into fundamental, tell me you have seen it\u2019s PE, business model, demand, profit margin, and are unconvinced of the ongoing demand.\n\nNVDA - there is a reason why some stocks keep breaking new high and some stocks keep breaking new lows. NVDA has the fundamental, acquisition expectation, product demand, and profit margin. I bought at $605 and it\u2019s now $800. After stock split it is only going to go up higher, if previous studies of stocks\u2019 price movement after stock splits are anything to go by. \n\nAMD - i watched it since it was $60+ last year. Is it too much now? Maybe not the cheapest. But definitely not going down any moment. And I\u2019m going vertical spread, PMCC, and naked puts with it. Majority of my options profit was from like 20+ trades on AMD, in the past 2 months. \n\nTsm - I owned it at $63 and it\u2019s only going to go up higher with the world\u2019s largest producer of something that every product manufacturer needs, from aircon, to your fan and TV. In fact I\u2019ve just initiated a PMCC position with it.

I\u2019m sure a few slip by but overall they know which way bets will be placed and make sure it goes in the other direction or sideways as needed for their pockets. We all just have a 50/50 chance. In my opinion Nvidia was calculated to cut loose as well. They consolidated and let it fly like it would without manipulation. Now they are teasing us with AMD which will not hold up. At some point they will have to let it go it\u2019s own way too but not until they are ready! Probably all common knowledge to most on here but I had a bad day (MKC trading sideways was no accident) so this is my rant."

And that list should be different every month, possibly/probably every week with new names being added or removed.  Many of the names you specified are pumped up. BABA was the one for this month (on pullbacks) and end of last month (on initial gap down), but only because it got so beat down on a gap down right to long term trendline support. You want that sort of thing. FB is kinda getting there, but I'd like to see it near 200-220 to start up. All the other names are overextended i.e. you're playing with no other edge besides theta. I made a sale last week on TWTR because I like that it gapped down to daily chart support, but it's really a meh trade on my part because I think it's a total shit company with shit leadership, though I believe I've got a solid technical thesis for it on the daily and the premiums were right (6% for the 40 day 30 deltas). So it's a pure swing, and I don't plan to wheel it if it breaks support."

Your [trade plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan) would tell you what to do about all of these. I daresay your plan would have said bail out of most of them sooner. Or maybe don't concentrate so much equity in tech to begin with. Did you miss the news about rising interest rates and rising inflation? Both are bad for tech.\n\n1. Compare the current prices with your forecast. If your forecast and original [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) are now wrong, update your forecast and expected value and go from there. If holding is +ev, hold. If rolling is +ev, roll. If nothing is +ev, dump.\n\n1. Next time, prioritize [risk management](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_planning). A good rule of thumb is risk no more than 5% of your total account liquidation value in any one position, and don't concentrate more than 50% of your account value in any one ticker/industry."

This means your broker will sell off your assets in order to satisfy an unpaid margin if said margin falls below a certain threshold. In a volatile market 100$ could be worth 20$ then 100$ again.

It will be crazy again next week - that is unless there is a market correction that keeps Nvidia stale or even drops it a little. 14 100 seems to be a strong point of resistance for the Nasdaq.

  "Text": "b\"With the volatility and uncertainty of the economy and future FED policies, I've been thinking of pulling most of my positions while selling a put on QQQ and buying a leap as well.\\n\\nSince I'm selling a put on QQQ, I need the available funds (cash secured). Margin willing, I'd like to store that cash and give it upside potential while eliminating downside risk. That's where the married put came to mind, say buy 100 shares of something along the lines of NVDA, TSLA, or AMD shares and buying an ATM put far out (1-2 years) for each 100 shares (rolling covered calls also to help reduce premium for the put)\\n\\nBut I got to thinking, what advantage does that actually serve over just doing a call LEAP? \\n\\nI could buy the leap and store my cash in some low volatility dividend fund and still buy protective puts for much cheaper.\\n\\nSo, which is really better, the married put ( for this instance think 2 years) or the call LEAP?\"",

Not a coincidence.\n\nIf you are planning to sell covered calls, the shares can be a bit easier to manage.  Depending on your margin treatment, there can be advantages to the call vs. having the shares/married put."
