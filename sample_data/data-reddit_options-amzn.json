This is at expiration and only a very rough estimate for your chances at profit. \n\nDo you like the odds? Probably not, but go in with eyes open.\n\nYour choices are to take the loss (my vote), ride until the CPI or to expiration, or perhaps add capital by rolling out in time. \n\nRiding to the end or adding to a loser are popular choices with gamblers (the majority on this sub) and tend to lead to losing everything at some point."

It's longer term trend is still bearish, and it has now likely resumed its bearish trend. You may be lucky and get a quick bounce to about 105, but it'll be brief so grab it quickly if it happens.\n\nGOOGL is a little harder to read right now. If I had to guess I'd say it is still in an upward  corrective pattern (the second leg) with some support around current levels. So you might see some higher highs in the short term. Longer term, however, odds are in favour of it also resuming a bearish trend along with the tech sector (and perhaps the market) as a whole.\n\nI could be wrong. Not an exact science, etc etc."

     "I assume you mean these are long positions, not short, i.e., you bought the contracts. Unfortunately, these options are significantly OTM and theta decay in their last week is going to devalue them fast. You will need to take action soon if you don't want to lose all your premiums.  It's not that your ship has sunk so much as it has sailed away on you, and you will need to either find another boat or just vote yourself off the island.\n\nAmong your choices:\n\n* sell them all at a loss - putting it behind you can often be the least aggravating\n* vertical spread - i.e., sell, not buy, the same options with the same expiry dates and use the calls to secure them.  Selling won't get much you much money at this point but the options expiring OTM will at least secure the smaller premium you collected in them and offset the loss.\n* roll them out - later expiry date, perhaps with a lower strike price.  Make sure they're cheaper than what you paid for the original ones.  Don't chase good money after bad here - buy them for less than what you paid for these original ones.\n* mix, match, or combine the above if you have +1 options of either.\n* prayer never hurts. :)\n\nRemember that CPI figures will be announced on Tuesday 2/14 at 8:30am ET, so you might consider holding onto your decisions until then and see what the equities do.\n\nAside:  I actually sold the same AMZN option you bought as a covered call, and will likely close it on Monday so I don't have to wait through a potential bump.  Your gain is my loss if that happens. :) Also, I don't have options on GOOGL.  I bought a few shares a few days ago on a limit order that was executed at $100 but now I see the price is at $94.  I would hate having so far OTM options in your position.\n\nAll in all, I'd say you're going to lose something - the question is how much.  If you had another week, I'd say try riding your position a little longer but it's not at all likely you'll overcome your theta headwind with only 5 trading days left."

     "Dude forget options, just buy shares and thank me 30 years from now. \n\nYou have what is likely a once in a lifetime chance to own Amazon at these prices. \n\nThis is a company that outside of recessionary conditions is making $25 BILLION a year in net income, expected to do $500 billion in revenue this year and $560 billion next year AND STILL PROJECTED TO CONTINUE GROWING at an incredible clip. \n\nYou\u2019re paying about $900 billion for a company that has the best e-commerce, and cloud opportunity of any company in the world going into the future and is already the undisputed king in these sectors. MOAT? Think of what it would take for a competitor to come in and compete with them, the billions in infrastructure and talent required, there is no one even close to the level of market dominance that Amazon already has and no one with enough money to even put up meaningful resistance.\n\n$911 billion for a company with $186 billion in assets, and $19 billion in cash, which means you\u2019re really paying about $700 billion for the undisputed king of e commerce.\n\nThink ahead into the future, do you think online shopping will become bigger or smaller? Cloud/web services? I doubt brick and mortar retail will stage a meaningful comeback any time soon. Amazons total addressable market is expanding every year AND their share of that market is still expanding.\n\nThey\u2019re in so many different businesses already, streaming media, e-commerce, advertising, groceries, cloud computing, the list goes on and in, soon to be gaming, hardware, software, services, delivery/logistics etc..\n\nThis is a company that is competing with, and winning against, companies like Netflix, Disney, Microsoft, Shopify, google, Facebook, Apple, Nvidia, Walmart\u2026 \n\nThey\u2019re slowly taking over the world one sector at a time and you have 1 shot to get in at these prices.\n\nOptions will give you crumbs, you should seriously consider shares and get the whole cake.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if after this recession amazon goes on a decade long bull rally and ends up somewhere near $5 or $6 trillion. 30 years from now they could be paying quarterly dividends HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT PRICE OER SHARE. \n\nDon\u2019t mean to write a whole novel but companies like Apple and Amazon are in a whole league of their own, with the advantage going to Amazon in my opinion. It\u2019s a company that\u2019s designed to take over nearly every sector in the worldwide economy, while apple is limited to hardware, software, and services.\n\nThey will introduce all sorts of whacky shit that no one is even thinking of right now. Imagine putting Fedex and UPS out of business because they get so good at automated drone delivery that sending an item through the mail costs 10x as much.\n\nImagine a 90% reduction in google shopping searches because it\u2019s easier, cheaper, and better to just buy everything from Amazon instead of shopping at individual websites. Imagine instead of companies building websites to sell products, they list it on Amazon instead. Imagine amazon acquiring Netflix and Disney and integrating all streaming media into one amazon prime membership instead of people having accounts with 5 different services. Imagine shopify going out of business because it doesn\u2019t make sense to have a e-commerce website any more. Imagine every 99% of the western world having an Amazon prime membership because they have expanded and dominated all the other countries out there. Imagine no one hosting their own servers, and businesses not having any computer hardware anymore because it\u2019s better do just cloud compute with AWS.\n\n20 years ago the bulls were saying imagine shopping malls closing down because e-commerce is better, it\u2019s already happening and the rate is increasing.\n\nJust crazy to think of what this company is going to be doing in 39 years, all the different lies they will have their finger in, the truckloads of money they will make for their shareholders.\n\nShares dude. Don\u2019t settle for a few thousand bucks today  when you can have hundreds of thousands or even millions down the road simply by exercising a little patience and taking ownership in something."

AMZN had amazing numbers while the economy was hot, so these will make tough comps to beat for at least several quarters . . .\n\nThe stock is down considerably, so some of the above may already be priced in, and since you are bullish, it might make sense to sell puts if you are good with holding the shares if assigned.  Selling 42 dte around the .30 delta could bring in about $2.50 at the 83 strike and a net stock cost of $80.50 if assigned.  The Trefis estimate still shows a $160+ valuation, so this still seems cheap in the big picture.  \n\nThese puts could be rolled to lower that NSC even more before being assigned and might avoid assignment altogether.  \n\nIf assigned then selling covered calls at or above the NSC can keep bringing in premiums and lowering the stock cost more and more.  This is called the wheel strategy and is popular when you have a stock you don't mind owning.  \n\nIMO long calls are more of a gamble as you will not make anything if the stock stays sideways or doesn't move up enough as IV dropping and theta decay eat away the value . . ."

     "Think about it this way: Owning stock long term in growth companies gives you most of your return through the increase in the stock price. Those increases happen in ways and at times that you can't predict. They usually happen quite quickly. Lets say you bought FB in the past month at 188: \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png](https://i.imgur.com/rgxL8hd.png)\n\nYou figured it's basically a value stock at this point. You know many folks think it'll go up, but you don't think it will for some time. You sell covered calls at a strike of 200 and earn the premium. It pops up to 229 as it has in the past few weeks. Your shares are called away and you miss out on a 29 per share increase in the stock price. \n\nYou made a small premium, but missed out on a big jump. That jump could have happened after your covered call expiry, in which case you'd win. But it didn't. \n\nIf you're selling covered calls on growth stocks, you're going to make more premium but you're going to miss out on bigger growth opportunities. \n\nIf you sell covered calls on value stocks that tend to trade within a tight band, you won't make much premium because the implied volatility is so low - so even though the likelihood of the stock increasing is much lower, so is the amount you earn from selling a covered call option. \n\nSelling covered calls also adds complexity and costs. So if I was you, I'd consider buying and holding long term and actually benefit from the growth in stock, instead of selling away that growth for a small premium. That way you keep the growth opportunity for yourself, without any costs other than the original transaction fee for the stock purchase. \n\nThere's another factor that your options premiums are taxed as short term capital gains - in other words, ordinary income. If you hold a stock for longer than a year, not only do you benefit from the growth, but your gains are taxed as long term capital gains. \n\nThe problem is that this approach requires patience, a willingness to defer gratification, which is difficult for most people, and does not involve much trading activity, which is also a problem for folks who want to think of themselves as \"traders\". \n\nYMMV. This is not tax advice or investment advice."

Shoot holes in my plan.\n\nI think this is a great start to a plan but requires quite a bit more detail. It looks like some of it is implicit for you in your second paragraph but I'll mention some of the things I'm thinking about anyways in case you hadn't considered them:  \n\\-Will you sell below your basis? If so, how would you deploy (how far below your basis, DTE, return requirements, etc)?  \n\\-If not, is the plan to simply hold the stock? What's the downside risk management plan? Even if you intend to hold these forever, things change so it's still good practice to think through how you'd unwind in the worst case scenario.   \n\\-NVDA pays a small dividend, does this factor into the plan at all?   \n\\-Are you looking for any specific balance between these three? Rebalancing plans? \n\nA few initial thoughts for discussion, hope one or two of these may be useful."

     "Problem is, when they run, they run.  I have/had four stocks I wish I never wrote calls on.  The run ups far outweigh what any premiums were collected.   The first was MSFT which was stuck in the twenties years ago.  I had about 500 shares off and on, wrote calls, sold puts, collected divvies, all good until Balmer was booted and replaced.  Then the stock went on a tear and I couldn\u2019t keep up trying to roll the calls. Soon it was in the forties, then fifties, etc. Now $300 a share.   I bought 2000 shares of MOS about 3\\~4 years ago after the sell off,  selling puts and calls when it was bouncing around back in the low twenties and mid teens.  I thought it was a really good trading stock for options.  The income was good.  Did ok.  Then it started to move.  Almost hit $70 recently.  I still have the calls in the low 30\u2019s but missed out on about $80k of profit.  Had 1500 of OXY in the low teens and got called away in the low $30\u2019s.   I have a $310 June call on COST.  It moved too fast to roll up.  Still hasn\u2019t been called away, now collecting puny divs.  That\u2019s almost $28k in lost profit.  Very annoying to say the least.  AMZN and Google I would accumulate.  Write puts instead."

     "OK here it goes.  I would assume you are around you phone or computer full time to be trading options.\n\nApril 29 Contract date (GOOG $3,100 strike = 21.00) (AMZN $3,700 strike = 30.00) (NVDA $315 strike = 5.76)\n\nGOOG - selling 7 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $700 per month. \n\nAMZN - selling 8 cc's after the split will bring in approximately $1,200 per month\n\nNVDA - selling 6 cc's will bring in $3,420 per month\n\nSelling 1 GOOG or AMZN cc will be a giant waste of time.  Take some more time and learn and practice selling covered calls so you feel comfortable selling all 7 or 8 contracts.   You will need some liquidity, but here is my opinion.\n\nSell the April 29 contracts with strike as noted above.  Wait a little while after the split, because chances are, the stock will initially rip up before it settles into a normal pattern.  If the stock goes up, roll over your calls to a later date. If stock trades sideways, the time element is on your side. If stock drops, you can but back your contract for a bargain and repeat. (or just let die worthless and do again)  As long as you have liquidity, you can continue to roll over. \n\nNVDA is a different animal. Due to it's volatility, this stock will bring in premium.  Again, as long as you have liquidity, you can sell cc's and roll over those calls should the stock price rise substantially.  If trades sideways, you buy back cheap and repeat, or hold until contract is worthless.   \n\n\nI honestly don't worry about being assigned.  If the contract goes in the money, there's no guarantee you will be assigned.  I neve have been. I recently have a June 17th $150 call trading at $185 and I just bought back the contract for $5,500, pushed back the strike date a month and sold another for $5,500 increasing the strike price to $180.\n\nIf, for some reason you get assigned, just buy back the stock. If you let it get to a spot where it's well over your strike price, shame on you. \n\nThe downside is, you are a long term holder of stock. So pick companies you believe in for the long run.\n\nAs for BABA situation, hopefully people were selling calls on the way down. When it rips up 30%, you roll over.  \nRemember, each time you sell a contract, you put premium in your account.  And each time a contract expires, that premium is yours. \n\nYou don't always have to be ITM, as long as you have the liquidity to roll over. Roll over on the way up, take premium on the way down"

These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo. Strategy suggestions welcome\"",

     "I love the theta Strat's such as selling puts.  That's pretty much all I do and to be honest, the returns are pretty good!  As long as you choose solid names so that if you get exercised you're protected, you'll be good.  I also use a hybrid where I sometimes sell put credit spreads (very solid names).  \n\nReading your comment and based on the deltas of your straddle, you are assuming more upside for the market which is my bias as well.  Selling puts or theta strategies however don't allow that upside gain as our returns are more or less fixed.  The strangle is an interesting idea.  Personally, I am considering a call roll strategy where I go 30 days out and get at the monies.  This will give me the upside I need to keep up with the market while the puts will continue to print.  That being said, I should probably investigate methods to hedge my downside just in case.\n\nWhat do you guys think though, strangle to pad the stats or call roll?  I'm curious.\n\nAlso, I am using a bigger portfolio"

     "I'm not sure I understand your edge here. What is it that you think the market is not pricing in?\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but you will have 5 shares of GOOGL, which will become 100, so you want to sell 1 call which you think will be covered after the 20:1 split? That's not correct.\n\nIf you're short 1 call of GOOGL $4000 strike pre-split, those will automatically become short 20 contracts for 100 shares each at $200 strike post-split. (EDIT: it might be 1 contract for 2,000 shares at $200 strike). Do you want to be short calls for 2,000 shares on a ~$133 stock?\n\nIf I missed something let me know, I know you said you would close pre-split. I'm just not sure why you're using the split as a timing factor here. \n\nIf you have 5 shares of GOOGL and sell that $4000 call, you'll probably be close to delta-neutral, and short vega. Is that what you want? You should re-delta-hedge if the stock rises because you'll be screwed if it shoots up for some reason. This is the whole pennies/steamroller analogy."

They cost about ~6,500 each and they payout ~13,000 if AMZN is over 3750 in a year. I went with a year because then it will be a long term hold and not a short term one. It's still speculative because if the whole market has huge issues between now and then they will become nearly worthless, but considering AMZN reached that price just a couple months ago gives me an extreme amount of confidence in this."

My only hesitation and point that I would bring up is the both QQQ and SPY are both trading at all time highs, and we haven't seen a real 5-10% pullback/correction since April. With the market trading super hot right now, delta looming and inflation data not looking good in the short term, I think we are more than due for at least a 5% pullback across many sectors, if not more so in big tech.\n\nAnother interesting point of bullishness I can see for Amazon in terms of TA is looking at the One year chart with weekly candles and the 50 day Simple Moving Average. In the past year or so time frame, each time AMZN has dropped down to its 50SMA, it tends to bounce off it as support. As of today it seems to be using the 50SMA as support again and a green candle is forming. I would be inclined to agree with you that it is at a strong support level and your position seems well suited for strong gains"

     "Wow i thought i was alone. Just on monday i had a huge mess up on a trade because of incorrect data being shown to me. A trade i was trying to place for 13k was instead placed for 450,000 dollars in options. My buying power was apparently being based on two day old quotes and quotes I were seeing were from two days ago. My balance went to -130,000 immediately. I called td right away on the verge of complete manic mode. They then force liquidated my position and said i then owed them the 130k and only thing to do now now would be to talk to collections on figuring out a payment plan. The next two days were the most stressful days of my life and I probably called and talked to about 20 different lawyers about what to do. Very luckily yesterday TD risk manager called me from his personal cell and said after talking with senior management they were doing a courtesy to me and removing the debt and restoring my original balance. He reiterated i had no legal basis to pursue them though. This is insane and the emotional stress on me alone probably do some permanent damage to me. This is not right."

Usually, it's during power hour. I also got an interesting notice on my desktop ToS today. After leaving it open for a long time, it showed me an error message and said something along the lines of ToS ran out of RAM. Increase from 512 to 1024 and restart? I hit yes, and it restarted. Not sure if ToS needs to be restarted a lot in order to get rid of laggy performance and delayed quotes. And, yes, I also turned on realtime quotes."

Previewed orders, private messages sent with specific intentions. Document everything went something feels off and every way possible with what you are trying to do while you are calling them. The only thing they could be doing is routing your orders to specific market centers in higher volumes than their execution quality would dictate they should get while receiving kickbacks from that specific market maker. All you have to do is call your firm and ask how they choose where their order flow goes. \n\nHell, you can even ask to only be routed to certain ones or only one. Market orders can fuck you, but that is your fault for placing a market order without understanding what that means and how market makers operate.

     "Some thoughts and corrections....and I don't mean to be insensitive, just realistic...\n\nFirst, factually, Schwab and TDA have not merged. Schwab has nothing to do with TDA operationally at all right now. Any issues with TDA are their own. \n\nWhat's going on? Record volumes which affect the exchanges processing trades, and record new account holders at some brokerages which affects their systems' processing abilities with their clients. \n\nLayered on top of record volume and accounts are the inherent limitations of existing brokerage platforms. They are legacy systems with new software grafted on. Like any similar situation - think medical, DMV, etc - they are inherently less stable.\n\nEven without the above limitations any system - mechanical, computational, hell even social - when pushed to its tolerances faces an exponentially higher probability of failure. The best engineered Ferrari when driven hard at redline for two hours is at higher risk of failure.\n\nSo therefore.....Guys, this is what a market break looks like. And we haven't even had a circuit breaker down day yet. And - short history lesson - this occurrence is neither the first nor worst. During the 1987 crash the floor shut down...not client facing brokerages, but the actual exchange floor. Ditto the Fedwire system. Money could not even be transferred through the banking (vs. brokerage) system during the day. Forget accurate, timely quotes...investors (retail and institutional) couldn't even track their cash in banks.\n\nWhat does it all mean? \n\nA brokerage platform failure under last week's conditions is neither your fault nor the responsibility of the brokerage.\n\nThose statements are not incongruous...both conditions can logically exist in the same time and space. That is the disclosure under Paragraph 3. That disclosure, btw, is not unique to brokerages. Such concept, and the ensuing clause, is present in most contracts.\n\nThe situation last week was analogous to a western NY record lake effect snowstorm. You have the reasonable expectation that your town's roads are maintained. It's snowing, two feet so far, and winds are 45 mph with whiteout conditions. You hop into your SUV, spin out on some ice, and end up in a ditch. Not your fault, but not the responsibility of the DMV either...\n\nIf we have a crazy upcoming week in the market please don't be the dude that plants his family in the snowbank. Know the limitations imposed on you by the environment and your equipment. Or, drive out in the middle of the storm and wait for the tow and ambulance, and be indignant that the roads weren't cleared.  Just remember, injured and indignant is not where you want to be with your family or your capital.\n\nGL to all this week."

TOS does have stupid stuff going on from time to time.  Yesterday everything was a mess early on and I have seen it just stop updating here and there too.  This also seems to be regional.   They say up front in one of their disclosures that volume and system issues can cause delays.\n\nI've been using TOS for a lot of years.  I've subscribed to real time/L2 quotes and generally works fine.  If I put in an order (typically autosend) and it goes against me, that's on me for agreeing to pay a certain amount on a trade and the instrument goes opposite of what I thought.  The deskop app can be set from 0 delay to 15 seconds (with options for 1, 2, 10 and 15 seconds.  Why anybody would delay is a mystery to me)\n\nIs the suggestion that even real-time quotes are delayed?   And what's the definition of \"delayed\"?  I can certainly see how my desktop might be a few seconds behind the actual market-- it's called latency folks.   Some/many of those platforms are in a data center in NJ.  I'm in Arizona.  There's a reason why institutions co-locate their servers in NJ.  It would be silly to expect that you're not going to get latency between the NJ data center, TD facilities and your desktop.   Hell, my wife could be on one PC execute an order and I get the confirmation ding right away or 2-3 seconds later on my PC.\n\nEDIT:  OP also appears to be looking at the \"charts\" tab.  I'd never use that for anything other than TA over a period of time beyond a day.  For any intraday stuff I always use the active trader charts - tick and minute charts.  And changing values on either of those can do some goofy stuff to the candles, especially changing tick values (clearly b/c it's recalculating the chart)."

That being said trying to place any trades, or even seeing any fkn \\[option\\] contact volume, on RH was a nightmare as well. CNBC did mention that this week had record trade volume and it's pretty easy to see how the brokerage networks/servers could be overwhelmed.   \n\n\nEx: my buddy uses Fidelity and he was completely locked out of his account on wed or Thursdays. Couldn't log in to close out his MSFT calls. We joked that Fidelity owed him the difference between the max profit he knew he had, had he been able to close out the position, and the money he lost when he was finally able to log in at 3pm and close out his position.   \n\n\nJust goes to show that these networks aren't stressed tested as well as they could be. I wonder how other brokerages faired as I have considered switching to IB/Lime's LightSpeed (to use the CBOE's LiveVol software)/TastyWorks/E\\*Trade.\n\nIt was very surprising to see that not only did the data take literally minutes to load after inputting a symbol for a chart but also when switching symbols the charts would still show the previous symbols data!   \n\n\nSide note: I wonder how the more capitalized clientele faired. The more I have with them, the more revenue I trade for them, the better I expect my connection/fills to be!"

It should help explain things a little more visually but for more detail I'm writing it all out below:\\n\\nFor a little background, this approach looks to capitalize in a large intraday or overnight spike in a stock. The opportunity allows for us to sell puts out of the money and profit as the stock settles. The great part is that we don't have to get in early and guess which way the stock will run, but rather we wait for the volatility and use that opportunity to react to it. \\n\\nMore specifically, we look for 4 main points on these trades. \\n\\n**1) A spike in the stock.** This one is pretty self exp\"",

     "You mentioned vega (which means you are looking at a pure volatility trade) without once talking about delta hedging. As a result you have both volatility AND delta/drift exposure, which means you're one piece of news away from a spectacular blowup. I understand you are looking to stay in a trade a few minutes but that's all it takes to lose far more than these pennies you are picking up. Convexity cuts both ways.\n\nOn stocks this volatile and unpredictable, pure naked short trades are inadvisable. If you are happy with 1% returns naked, you should be just as happy with 0.5% returns (or less) hedged. Pure volatility plays should have delta exposure hedged away."

     "This is interesting, and reflects my thinking too.\r  \n\r  \n2) Re \"Good news driving the spike\"\r  \nThat makes complete sense. When you calculate a stock's volatility based on past variations in its price, and use the Black\u2013Scholes model to calculate the appropriate price for the PUT option, the assumption is made that that volatility will continue into the future. But if you have a big move in the price that increases this volatility and hence the price of the PUT, the reality is that this extra volatility won't continue into the future (because it came from a discrete news event). Therefore if you sell short the PUT you are receiving more money for it than you should, giving rise to an average profitable trade.\r  \nNow the question is, do more sophisticated traders understand this principle, and choose to ignore the news-related move in their calculations of what they want to pay for the option? I don't know. But presumably there are some, perhaps a lot, of traders out there who don't make this adjustment, and in error regard the value of the option as being higher than it really is. You profit by trading against them.\r  \n\r  \n3) \"There must be an established trading base\"\r  \nMaybe. But I'm inclined to think the only purpose of this is that it might reduce historical measured volatility, meaning that when the news spike comes, it makes a bigger difference, so increasing the effect of 2) above.\r  \n\r  \n4) \"There must be decent option premium at the trading base\"\r  \nYes, but it is important to understand why there is higher option premium. The AMC is a case in point. In AMC's case the PUT options are much more expensive than the CALL options for strike prices nearly the same as the share price. This would partially explain the positive returns you are seeing, but only because of the Theta (time) decay of the option.\r  \nNow normally this CALL/PUT difference (absent a dividend payment) would give rise to a risk-free arbitrage situation, because all you need to do is sell the expensive PUT, buy the cheap CALL, and then go short on the underlying stock. This exactly neutral position guarantees a profit equal to the difference in the PUT and CALL prices.\r  \nWell normally it would. But in the case of AMC, for reasons I won't go into here, there is a huge interest rate (around 800% per annum), charged by the market in order to borrow the stock (needed to sell it short). The daily interest charged by this offsets the gains from that trade."

     "> For a little background, this approach looks to capitalize in a large intraday or overnight spike in a stock. The opportunity allows for us to sell puts out of the money and profit as the stock settles. The great part is that we don't have to get in early and guess which way the stock will run, but rather we wait for the volatility and use that opportunity to react to it. \n\nFollowing fresh volatility spikes is the most consistent winner I have and I should really just go back to doing it 100% as nothing has \nbeen as reliable as selling CSPs during these intraday/overnight moves.\n\nA lot of people don't seem to notice how both the puts and calls go up during some of these 50-100% moves, which is what I focus on.  At this point I've been doing it so long that I have a general feel for what kinda fills I can get, especially important when they are low volume/not very liquid.  I'm a bit of a stickler trying to get the most outrageous fills I can, so most of my limits never hit... but when they do, quite nice.\n\nI even made a little [website](https://larval.com) based around the intraday moves, I just have it running in the background during the work day and take a gander when a move I'm interested in happen.\n\nAnother winner I've noticed during these events, other than the CSPs, is the calendar crunch that happens.  You can frequently find that the current months strikes are trading for almost the same amount as several months to a year out."

Looks possible\u2026\n\nI don\u2019t think this is due to any irregularity in option pricing from a theoretical point of view.\n\nAfter a spike in the stock, there is a good chance that somebody\u2019d like to take profit on this PUT sold earlier. He just wants to unlock capital, so there is no big difference for him between $0.10 and $0.12 if he sold it for $2.00. But for you it\u2019s a huge difference.\n\nI would suggest to use diagonal spread, i.e. to buy 1 PUT with higher strike instead of pure selling. Like this you\u2019ll have some delta hedge.

     "> Is a TP percentage between 20-50% too small?\n\nA successful scalper that posted here a few years back used $.10 profit or $.05 loss. Cents, not percents. Well, actually dollars since x100, but you get what I mean. So that should give you an idea of how whack 20-50% is as a goal.\n\n> Now my goal is to trade smarter and more disciplined.\n\nThen stop worrying about woulda/shoulda/coulda. The trade you exited **for a profit** could have ended up a huge loss if you held longer. Focus on making good trade decisions and let go of what happens afterwards. Ideally you should be completely indifferent to what happens after your exit a trade. It's literally none of your business.\n\nMore details about trading decisions and good trading mindset here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourdecisions\n\nAnd the cousin of your FOMO mindset is results-oriented thinking, where you make a bad trading decision but justify it by a good (lucky) outcome: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/"

If you were able to make one trade per week and return 20%, you'd have well over a 1,000,000% return per year. The question isn't what is a good target percentage return, the question is whats the expected return of your strategy. If your stop loss is 25% and your target return is 20%, then you obviously have to win more often than you lose otherwise your strategy will be a loser. But 20% is a fantastic return on an annualized basis, so yes compounding small returns is great but if you think a 20% return is small then you need to readjust your expectations."

Basically these are nearly ATM at current prices.\\n\\nJust looking at the current AMZN chart - it looks quite primed to breakout, but regardless we have a huge gap to fill above to 3579 - hard to think it wouldn't fill that gap within the next year, and certainly within the next two years.\\n\\nMy gut says this is basically free money, but wanted to get some more perspective before going in.\\n\\nThanks in advance!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit - Yes, I know the best time would have been to buy these post-ER near 3200.

If AMZN heads down rapidly, you might not recover that original outlay.   \n\nYou can roll the short from 3/18 at 2900 up about 100 dollars, expiring April 22, for around zero net credit to 3000, and if AMZN stays up above 3000, you could have about a 5,000 gain in April, or roll the short again, all this without putting more money into the trade.      \n\nAMZN famously moves around, and it is difficult to capture its location unless you have about three or four calendar spreads at the same time, about $100 to $200 from each other.    \n\nIf AMZN falls below 2900, you may end up with a loss on this, through April.      \nYou could roll the short out in time, to May, in April, and roll it up or down.    \nIdeally, given the cost of the original calendar, net of 250, you want AMZN to be above 250 + 2700 for above 2950 for a gain, in May.    \n\n---  \n\nThe 3200 April 22 calendar, you could roll the short out week by week, collecting an additional credit, and maintaining flexibility to move the short in future rolls.    \n\nRight now, rolling out a week to March 25, is a net of about $16  credit. This is a pretty happy roll to do every week, given the original net cost of the calendar to be around $15 to start with. \nYou have about four more rolling opportunities. \n\n---  \n\nThe above was written from the perspective of maximum flexibility to move the shorts around in the future.  \nYou could elect roll them out now, deciding between credit versus moving to a new strike price.    \n\nYou could exit now, and avoid the risk that AMZN goes down again, taking the easy gains while you have them. \n\n\n---"

     "NEW GUYS ---->\n\nNajarian brothers books. They wrote 2, if on budget get at least the newest one. Easy to understand and while they dumb it down for cnbc crowd on tv, the books themselves cover important territory. \n\nAndrew Keenes book is good too for newbs. Whatever happen to that guy anayways. I liked his energy in chicago  pits \n\nYou can also do all courses on OIC, CBOE, and OCC. Google search it, i watched all the videos and passed all the exams/quizzes yrs ago. Pretty sure it was all free. \n\nDo the very good courses free at TASTY trade learning center. Do both beginners & advanced. I highly recommend this. \n\nOverby - option playbook. 90% visuals and payoff diags but damn he crushed this book. I feel like this is a must own. Get hardcover \n\nOption alpha - free videos and courses\n\nIBKR campus - go to traders academy courses - free videos and quizzes \n\nBloomberg market concepts - its a low cost course/ it has a decent section on options. If i ran a capital markets 101 class, I would make all freshmen do this before day 1. Just FYI\n\nSang lucci - he was more active back in the day and his old you tube videos from 2013-15 on order flow sweeps and ATM weeklies on fangs are fun as heck to watch. I like his focus on tape and bc he was trained as a prop trader, he has good fun read on mkt microstructure. \n\nThink or swim/TDAM - free videos, covers need to knows @ learning center\n\nCME institute - free \"all about options\" course @ their learn center \n\nMID LEVEL ---->\n\nSpina/Sosnoff - tom a goat and chicago legend; concise book and zero fluff \n\nMcmillan - get 5th edition of strategic investments. Consensus bible and weighs more than a cinderblock \n\nNatenberg - perennial favorite\n\nHull - goat but dense\n\n\nADVANCED/OTHER ANGLES ---->\n\nMcmillan on options\n\nThe option edge - very academic, but has its moments where it really loops in everyday stuff, like market makers and why Berkshire sells OTM puts. Content good - problem is they printed only paperback size 5 font so its basically unreadable without a magnifying glass. \n\nPodcasts - ally options playbook is the best (apple, spotify) \n\nColin bennett - trading volatility / cool stuff in here that is not found elsewhere\n\nJeff augen - he wrote 3 gems, all on amazon \n\nTrading option greeks - dan parsanelli. Well-scoped book\n\nHow to Calculate option prices and their greeks - Ursone\n\nIntrinsic - mike yuen. Entire book about leaps on tech names during a bull cycle. For practical purposes, ch 5-10 are good and in plain language cover his actual trades; those looking for an actual trader perspective might enjoy this. \n\nIntelligent option investor - takes a value investor approach, covers lot of ground/key concepts\n\nTaleb - dynamic hedging - hard to find book / deep practical philosophical. This dude is smart!! \n\nSinclair - he has 3 books i have yet to read\n\n\nBEAST MODE/FINAL THOUGHTS -->\n\nregarding exams...consider the CFA FRM CMT CFP CAIA CIPM CTP exams. All levels of all these exams touch the subject in some form or another. The first 2 treat it far more rigorously. CTP way too light a treatment, unfortunately. CMT focuses lot on vix. CFP covered the meat and potatoes better than i expected. Should you want the journal entries for how companies book stock comp/option awards, becker CPA far books really cover the must-knows. \n\nPursue MBA - most top programs default to hull in the derivatives class & authors that both the FRM/CFA base their actual exams on. Adding this in case someone is looking at bschool/MSF down the road.\n\nLastly, if looking for a gift idea or curious what it was like on the floor years ago, \"trading pit hand signals\" by carlson is one sweet as fk coffee-table book. Its true, the traders have seperate gestures for straddles and strangles. \n\nBest of luck!"

The option buyer has until 5:30pm ET to contact their broker to assign and this can be based on the afterhours price move.\n\nIf you were shorted the stock your broker will buy the shares on the market for the current price and then \"loan the shares\" to you to sell to the option buyer at the strike price of $3480.  If this occurred then you will be getting those funds of $348,000 added to your account on Monday or Tuesday at the latest (this is a holiday weekend so likely Tuesday or even Wednesday).\n\nYou will need to buy the stock to replace what the broker loaned you at the market value when you have the cash on Monday or Tuesday.  If the stock price drops then you can buy these cheaper, but if the stock rises then you may owe more.  If it rises too much I suspect the broker will close out the position for you, especially if you have a smaller account that cannot support a large loss.\n\nThe long protective leg expired worthless so is now gone and can offer no protrection.\n\nIt is usually posted multiple times each week to not let spread options expire.  See what can happen in this video, and you should find out tomorrow if you were assigned or not.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVFj9nRRDo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVFj9nRRDo)  \n\nWith luck you were not assigned, but if you were then hopefully AMZN stays well behaved and maybe even drops some."

  "Text": "b'Hi guys, \\n\\nSecond day as an option trader, I bought an $AMZN call that expires for next week (May 7) $3550. After hours on $AMZN > $3600. I was ITM the entire day but at close it went negative? Any idea what is going on? \\n\\nBTO: 3 units @ $56.50. \\n\\nThanks.'",

     "ITM (in the money) is an option (for calls) where the strike price is less than the stock price. The amount by which a stock is ITM is the intrinsic value of the option. Amzn was around $3470 today, a strike at $3550 is OTM and has no intrinsic value, it is 100% extrinsic value (or time value).\n\nOption lose value every day, the extrinsic value decreases. At expiry, all extrinsic value will be gone and only intrinsic value will remain.\n\nI'm curious if you know how much risk there was in this position?\n\nWhat exactly went negative? It's hard to answer your question, if you saw an option price that went negative, you have to mostly ignore after-hour option quotes.\n\nSide-note, congrats, but be prepared for the price to not be as good as you think - it is a bit early to celebrate just yet. The intrinsic value of a $3550 strike with Amzn at $3600 is $50. If you sell close to expiry, the fair value will be $50. If you're awake during market open, monitor the price closely and IMO sell at least 1 of those options at whatever price if Amzn is at $3620 or better. If you wait too long, every hour, that extrinsic value will decrease. Also expect a large decrease in the extrinsic value on open due to reduced volatility. Now that earnings has been reported, option prices will drop significantly, maybe something like a third or half even.\n\nSo, you need to play this somewhat carefully. I think if you can exit with 2 @ $70 and 1 @ $85, you'll have done really well. There could be profit taking in Amzn tomorrow, it's not a given the price will continue to run and could easily slump down to lower $3500s (for example, Aapl crushed it, yet they finished today \\*down\\* by a dollar).\n\nUnsolicited advice, put an open order to sell at $70 for one of the options and hope that executes on open. Otherwise monitor the market in the morning and be ready to sell another at $60 if the price decreases. If the price runs up then sell your second at something like $80 and sell that last one for $85\\~$100 if you can. I would also try really hard to sell within the first 3 hours of the market being open, after that and you'll start losing a lot of extrinsic value quite rapidly  (ballpark perhaps something like $10/hr on the option price)."

     "Here are my predictions for what it is worth. I am prepared to be wrong and I appreciate OPs post!\n\nAAPL - Probably lower than expected revenues. Their stores were closed so that really hurts them and they were closed for a good chunk of the quarter. Furthermore, I read somewhere that when they opened stores, a majority of the customers were not there for new purchases, but for repairs. Their products are expensive and unemployment can't be good for their premium product sales (iphones, laptops, etc.). Big pull back after down into the $350s/$360s.\n\nLast note I forgot - hence the edit: The iphone announcement will be HUGE. I read some rumors that they are looking to Q4 now and NOT a September release for the new phone. 49.7% if Apple's revenue comes from Iphone sales!  If they are still pushing for September, all quarterly sales news, good or bad will not even matter. $400+ here we come!\n\nAMZN - Amazing revenues.... like insane revenues from both goods and AWS. But lower earnings due to added COVID measures. Small 3-5% pull back into the $2800s, maybe even a bit into the $2700s. AWS is my watch here. MSFT's Azure really crushed it last week. Either they are eating into AWS OR remote work will propel them. The earnings bar is set really high for them so I worry that even as well as they do, they still might disappoint.\n\nGOOGL/FB - Who friggin' knows. I can't imagine companies are spending a ton of marketing dollars AND laying people off. That doesn't make sense.\n\nNASDAQ/Tech Bubble - There is a retraction UNTIL the new stimulus is passed. And then things pop back up to where they are now. OR until good COVID news is generated (good vaccine, numbers going down, etc.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Fu\\*k tomorrow is a really big and frankly scary day. Right now I am leaning more towards a red AH and Friday :( Hope I am wrong."

I anticipate people trimmed their subscriptions, so reoccurring rev. will be down\n\nFB - Who knows, when I log in I always see these \"stock Gurus\" pumping their programs. I anticipate that advertisers are going to move to that vs TV especially given sports are just coming back\n\nGoogle - Similar thoughts with facebook, but everyone in states with high covid 19 had to move to online advertising, and also I think their cloud infrastructure is growing."

Did you get on the good side of vega? How did you know that IV was going to contract? Did you know in advance what the Fed minutes was going to say? How much of your play was delta, theta and vega?

I sold a amzn csp a few months ago at a strike of 3590 I know it was pretty stupid of me but I liked amazon especially with newer variants coming out and I assumed even with that pretty high strike I could sell CCs and make a decent amount of premium. Now Im down around 20% and I have been doing a lot of research into different Stock Repair Strategies and have pretty much narrowed it down to two. Sell a covered call below my cost basis and roll if it ever gets threatened or use a ratio spread to lower my cost basis. Now no matter how much research I do I still cannot figure out how doing a ratio spread on this position would allow me to break even. Can someone please explain to me how doing a ratio spread or some other stock repair strategy would improve my cost basis. Anyone other helpful suggestions on strategies, tips, literally anything at all would be most appreciated.'",

     "This is awesome, thanks for sharing. I\u2019m just learning about options so this was instructive. \n\nBy contrast I own one share of Amazon and it\u2019s appreciated 13%, or roughly $230. But it took a lot of capitol to get that one share and this is a relatively small gain (and still unrealized). \n\nA while back I set aside $5k to dip my toe in the stock market (I have more savings in safer Vanguard funds). The stocks I own have appreciated just over 50% so far which is nice but not the kind of money to send kids to private school (and not money in the bank yet either). Anyway, thus the interest in options. It may not be the best fit for me in the end, but I\u2019m starting to look into it.\n\nI\u2019m curious, and this reveals my fundamental lack of understanding about options here, but when you sell your calls to close out, who is buying them and what are they doing with them? Is anyone actually buying 100 shares of Amazon at that lower strike price? That can\u2019t be, but if not then what are they for? I\u2019m missing some essential understand of what options and are and how they actually work. \n\nAny help from anyone here would be appreciated. \n\nAlso, nice work!"

     "You have the advantage of two weeks left.      \nWho knows, maybe there will be a rip roaring rise in the next 10 market days.\n    \nIf you stay in, you could, as others have suggested, sell calls for a  call debit spread. \nSince this is a rescue trade, consider selling at $1605, or $1610.\n\nChoices, for Monday Nov 26, using market close option chain as  Nov 23 2018:        \n- Exit promptly for a net loss of around $6.55 per contract   ($22.55 basis - bid $16.00)       \n- Sell a credit call at 1605 for a maximum net loss of $8.15. Staying in the game for potential rise.       \n- Sell a credit call at 1610 for a maximum net loss of $ 9.10. Staying in the game for potential rise.       \n\nYou could create a call butterfly, at 1600 / 1610 / 1620, but you would need to fish for a price to get much additional credit, beyond the credit opportunities stated above. \n\nYou can also consider looking at additional credits with a credit put spread from a \"safe\" distance below at the money, say 1350.   There is probably not much money in this move with ten market days until expiration, and this is an increased risk. \n\n\nDetails below. \n\n----\n\nLooking at the option chain for the market close at Nov 23 2018: \n\nAMZN Exp Dec 7 2018      \n1600 C  / Last 16.55 /  change -6.05 / Bid 16.00 / Ask 17.20     \n1605 C / Last 17.00 / change -5.36  / Bid 14.40 / Ask 16.10     \n1610 C / Last 14.75 / change -7.05 / Bid 13.45 / Ask 15.10\t   \n\n- If you were able to sell at the closing bid at 1605C, you can lock in a maximum loss of $8.15 loss  ($22.55 cost minus a bid credit 14.40)             \n- Or, more optimistically, allowing for the potential rise of AMZN, making a $10 spread, selling at 1610C, a max loss of $ 9.10   ($22.55 minus bid credit $13.45)      \n\nAdditional things you can do:\n\nYou could sell a vertical call spread, making an iron butterfly, or an iron condor, for modest additional credit.\n\nAMZN Dec 7 2018      \n1615C  / Last 19.40  / change -2.05 / Bid 12.45 / Ask 14.15  /    (mid = 13.25)   \n1620C / Last 15.50 / change  -2.40 / Bid 11.50 / Ask 13.25   /    (mid = 12.50)\n\nSell additional credit spread to create    \nCall butterfly: +1 1600C / -2 1610C /  +1 1620C    \n\n1610C bid 13.45 credit    \n1620C ask 13.25 debit    \nNet  $0.20 Credit  - Needs a better than \"natural price\" for worthwhile additional credit.    \nFish for a price closer to the mid-bid-ask.    \nAt mid-bid ask, a highly optimistic trade, credit could be $0.75. \n\nCredit Spread for Call Condor    \n1600C / 1605C / 1615C / 1620C    \n1615C bid 12.45      \n1620C ask 13.25    \nNet: Debit $0.80            \nNeed better than \"natural price\" to have an additional credit    \n\n\n\n"

Both have Theta around .2 or under:\\n\\n3/17/23 $4 Strike - $1.48\\n\\n3/17/23 $5 Strike - $2.29\\n\\nLet's say we have 10k for our CSP's. At $5 strike we can sell 20 contracts for $4,580 total premium.\\n\\nThat seems like a pretty good return using our 10k leverage. Wouldn't be able to get anything close to that looking at GOOG, AMZN, META, etc... (We would need to spend more on those tickers anyway obviously, but you get the point)\\n\\nAMC currently trades at $6.26. 52 week low is $3.77, earnings are expected around March 7, and they have a reverse split vote March 14th that, if passed, would theoretically drive price higher and get rid of some of their debt.\\n\\nBesides it being a meme stock, this trade doesn't appear to have much downside. If one were to get assigned they'd be getting shares at a price near the 52 week low and then they could wheel it.\\n\\nWhat are everyone's thoughts?\"",

     "The amount of the premium, with no other metrics, will tell the story.   For AMC, I like the 4 better than the 5.  However, today it\u2019s most likely overvalued, meaning it will likely rush down to something more realistic leaving you in a come-from-behind situation for a month.  No early 50% escape.  In this case, the number of contracts only matters if it ties up too much of your account.  Getting starry eyed over the possibilities gets dangerous.\n\nI\u2019ll look at this for 1-2 contracts, but I don\u2019t like it much past that.  Thanks for the tip."

Bezos probably wanted someone to go to these congressional testimonies. (Congress feels insulted when CEOs send their deputies). He's not going away.\n\nIn any case, AMZN isn't nearly as volatile as some of the high growth names. So I wouldn't be worried too much."

     "This is why I love scaling into my positions. Once I like a long term play (often deep ITM leaps) I\u2019ll sometimes take up to 6 months to build my position. Some of that is scaling in when there\u2019s an opportunity and fundamentals haven\u2019t changed, sometimes it\u2019s taking on more risk if my initial position is so deep ITM it isn\u2019t providing the leverage I want.\n\nIf you have the capital and liked the position I\u2019d potentially suggest scaling in. If you only had enough money to build your position in a single trade \u2014 that\u2019s the risk you take. Often a fast lump sum is best, but at times DCA overperforms. That\u2019s randomness. \n\nI had this same thing with leaps in FXI, was able to reach my full position size in late Dec during delisting fears. To be fair I was never down at that point, but it looked highly risky at the time but I didn\u2019t even consider closing. If market crashes I still believe in my decision. Nothing you can do about rando market-wide fluxes. It was only a \u201cwrong\u201d decision if your DD is proven decisively incorrect.\n\nThat\u2019s right, if nasdaq drops 50% this year and Amazon goes with it, you won\u2019t necessarily be wrong on the company. We are probably in a bubble, but there\u2019s no telling when/if it pops. Good DD can\u2019t save you from that. I say you\u2019re good if nothing has materially changed."

So basically when tech sells off this sells off and when the Nasdaq and memes run this is stagnant because it\u2019s also considered a value/boomer stock. That explains why it\u2019s more than 10% off of its highs and actually negative since mid July.\nAs soon as this stock has it\u2018s face ripper breaking out of its chopping range the calls will explode.

But we never hear of them.\n\nCarter basically sold credit spreads, and given his 6000% return in 1.5 years, he's obviously taking a ton of risk on each trade.\n\nGoing forward, he may find his returns are not so good, cos his account is now larger and his emotions will change when he's playing with much larger amounts on the line.

     "In this example, I'd say you're sinking into a black hole. Averaging down is for short term dips that you can use as an oppurtinity to buy in in order to make more on the way up. The chances of Amazon increasing $600, or almost 20% by Feb 12 is highly unlikely, unless something magical happens which no one can predict or expect.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is: If you're down 50% on an option, it would take a 100% jump in the option premium for you to just breakeven. For you to just breakeven on the options you bought at $70 that are now $17, that's more than a 400% return just to be at breakeven, less when you factor in the other contracts you bought. It's probably best to cut your losses and move on, Amazon's not hitting $3700 anytime soon so your contracts will likely approach zero quickly."

     "This is not a high risk trade. This is an incredibly low risk trade. You\u2019re buying further dated calls and selling shorter dated calls, meaning that your short calls will always be covered by the long calls. \n\nYou close the trade when you\u2019re happy with the profit. Of course you want AMZN to go up, you\u2019re going to be long delta. If it\u2019s over 105 before the short leg expires, the long leg will still be worth more so you\u2019re fine. What really matters is how the long leg decays and if the spread is worth more than you bought it for at this point. Regardless, the most you can lose on this trade is the premium you pay for the spread, UNLESS you let the short leg expire in the money and don\u2019t close out the long leg. At that point yes you are at risk of AMZN falling after the short leg expires. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d only keep the long leg if the short leg expired worthless and I was bullish on AMZN for the next week. Otherwise, I\u2019d sell the entire thing as a spread sometime before the early expiration."

     "\"2. Choosing a long expiration such as Dec 2025 because I can't think of any advantages with a shorter expiry. Is this right?\"\n\nNot quite. With such a long DTE, the theta gain is very very slow. With a shorter expiry, you get faster theta and can keep reselling the short call again and again as long as its OTM.\n\n\n\"3. If AMZN stock price goes up to $150 or more before expiry, exit position immediately for approx 100% gain.\"\n\nIf the stock goes to 150 next week, you will not make 100% profit cos the short calls will have substantial time value and your 100 point wide spread will probably be worth 60ish. If the stock shoots way over 150 early, then yes, you'll get close to getting the full 100 points, which cost you 45.\n\nNice idea though OP.\n\n\nAre there any blind-spots here? What do you think about this strategy?"

I priced several PMCCs recently and for a lot of stocks, the IV in the near term is so low that there are scenarios in which the stock price could rise in the short term and you actually lose money on the trade overall. Just be sure to pay attention to the expected profitability.\n\nAlso, AMZN leaps are expensive. The November 29, 2021 2800 call will cost you over $60,000. That's not something I'd put in my portfolio."

Your losses can be astronomical. \n\nIf however you purchased 100 shares of amazon and wrote a call against the shares to lower your basis, that would be a substantially better idea. Yes you cap your upside but you gain downside protection and collect premium as income while you roll the short calls. Plus even if amazon explodes upwards you still have a gain from your basis up to the strike of the short call. Then you can sell cash secured puts and go the other way to renter amazon if you wanted.\n\nThe obvious issue is you need enough cash to buy 100 shares of amazon. Maybe find a cheaper stock and buy/write (purchase shares and sell a call) so you can learn and hopefully make a little $ in the meantime."

     "What's your thesis?\n\nYour trading strategy should be tied to a fundamental belief about how the market will move, and if your view is more correct than other traders, in the long run you'll make money.\n\nFor example selling calls but being long in the stock means \"I think this stock will continue to rise, but will do so relatively steadily, it may have some drops, but long run it will continue to rise\". \n\nIs this what you believe? If so, then great. Continue selling calls and reinvest the premiums in the stock.\n\nThe reason it's important to have a concrete thesis is because you need to identify when you are winning because your thesis is right, and *most importantly* when you thesis is no longer true, meaning you should exit you position and rethink your thesis.\n\nFor example if Amazon announced it's shutting down AWS, and the stock drops, if you don't have a thesis you might be inclined to hold a bad position longer hoping it will rise. However if you can see the news and say \"darn, I guess what I believed was wrong\", you can cash out, probably still a bit ahead (having been right for a while) and re-assess."

To your benefit, the insane spike in vols recently has probably made your short legs relatively more valuable, meaning that your losses won't be as bad as if AMZN had a slower, orderly decline.\n2. Roll them out further if you think this is just a temporary decline. You'll have to take on more downside risk to do so, but you'll give yourself some more time for AMZN to recover.\n3. Hold it if you've got the moxie to do so. Due to the vol observations in #1, you're probably not down as much as you should be, and if the market bounces in the next week and a half, you'll get a better exit at the very least.\n\nPersonally, if I had the buying power left, I'd be selling more put spreads on AMZN. This selloff is absolutely ludicrous, especially on basically no news. If you're not as strong in your conviction as I am, I'd do #2, or potentially change your strategy by closing the put spreads, and using the freed up buying power to open up pure short vol trades like a strangle or iron condor.\n\nI'll admit, having spreads that expire next week is a bit precarious...but then again, you also have to consider the potential outcomes of trades before you make them, and stick to your plan."

I want to sell a 9/21 or 9/28 iron butterfly for AMZN consisting of a 2040 long put, 2050 short put and short call, and 2060 long call. My plan is to close it early if/when it reaches 2050, which if I\\'m not mistaken is the price at which Amazon will reach 1 trillion market cap. As per Robinhood I can sell this iron butterfly for more than $900 credit, which means the max I can lose is less than $100. I know I won\\'t get to keep the full $900+ if I close early, and I\\'m ok to lose $100 or so if the price doesn\\'t go to 2050 before expiration. What\\'s the catch here? Is there a high chance I\\'ll get assigned on the short put early, since it\\'s in the money, and most likely I\\'ll just lose the $100?

And if IV slowly goes down from here on out ; you can close early and win some but that's moot. \n\nAt the moment AMZN is parabolic (albeit slowly) but that doesn't mean you can't play this or other similar range bound strategies. Design the range bound strategy by debiting further OTM long calls/puts and don't make the short strikes identical; varying them; hence an Iron Condor. Safer. Tradeoff is less money but a win is a win\n\nIf you want to be aggressive but with a much higher probability, try TSLA as an Iron Condor. IV is robust.

I would maybe call robinhood support to confirm exactly whats going to happen. But i believe when settlement comes around youll just be down your max loss.\n\nIf im right about you not having the capital to handle the temporary assignment then id suggest next time trying this out on a lower value underlying until you have a good handle on how this stuff works.

Your question seems to be \u201cWhere\u2019s the downside?\u201d or \u201cwhere\u2019s the risk?\u201d So, here\u2019s where I see risk:\n\n\n1) Far and away the biggest risk is just holding $140k in one single equity. That\u2019s not divested. Earnings tanks the stock, or sentiment drains the stock, and you could lose $15-20k in a day, or more. \n\n\n2) Since you\u2019re holding the risk of a stock that has high IV, the benefit should be that it\u2019s as likely to go up $15-20k as it is to fall $15-20k. If you sell the call, you\u2019re then selling some of that upside (depending on how far OTM you sell). \n\n\n3) If IV moves at all, the $1,000 call price might not be a real number. It might be a lot less. Additionally, the further out of the money you go, the less liquid the call is and the more unlikely it is to sell. I haven\u2019t looked at the options charts or anything, but just something to consider. Many times people see an ask of $1,000 and ignore that the bid is $500 and the volume is like 5 contracts which implies it\u2019s not selling well and not at that price. \n\n\nI\u2019m sure there are some other risks, but those are the ones that pop off the page to me.

It seems like it would be possible to fully pay for the long calls with the short calls, given that there is such a large discrepancy in theta between them. It seems *too easy*, if anything, so I might be overlooking something.\n\nAs for your strategy, you will have lower theta decay with a longer dated long option. Buying the shares instead of an option means a large cash outlay and potentially higher margin requirements. Of course, you could just borrow the cash with a box spread, since rates are so low."

If IV collapses, due to a quick rise in price, you\u2019ll miss out on those gains with a LEAP because the vega (long IV) component will work in opposition to your long delta.\n\nOn the other hand if the price slides and IV contracts (this can happen) you\u2019ll be hit in both directions being long delta and vega.\n\nIf you can afford 100 shares of AMZN and are comfortable with that position (kudos to you if so), I would look into selling a short put to go long. You can select the price where you\u2019d like to buy it and you immediately collect all the fat premiums. If the stock goes up the put will expire worthless and you can sell another one. If the price breaches your put then you will be assigned the shares at the price you selected and you still get to keep the premium. Then you can sell covered calls against it.

Amazon is my biggest holding, and it's had a horrendous year.  I'm still bullish long term on tech, but imo tech will continue to lag, until inflation is under control.  The CPI report on DEC 13 is the most important indicator of how these stocks will perform in the near term, but I'm also watching the recession looming, forming like a hurricane, induced by 15 years of cheap money, and the FED going cold turkey after binging .

     "First lets talk about why you want to make a change at all. A perfectly sound strategy would be to just continue to hold, or DCA and buy more shares at discounted prices, and wait another 10 years for things to average out. I'm not saying you have to do that, but I am asking why you decided not to. What has changed? Why do you think a pivot is necessary?\n\nThose aren't rhetorical questions. The answers are important to understand what the root cause is. Crafting a strategy without understanding what is motivating it is a recipe for making a bad decision/strategy.\n\n-------------------\n\nFor the sake of argument, I'll assume the reason is that you have discovered and gone beyond your risk tolerance. If that's not the reason, ignore the rest of this section.\n\nThe best thing to do, all things considered, is to rebalance your portfolio to lower its risk profile. That necessarily means selling some of your shares. You can tax manage that somewhat if you can select tax lots individually, but one way or the other, you are going to realize gains/losses and have tax impacts. However, I think you will find that the net net of all those tax impacts will cost you less in the long run than any kind of adventure into options and hedging.\n\nYou don't have to sell all your shares all at once. You can do a gradual reduction of risk by diversifying. And you can sell some of the losers to cancel out some gains on sales of the winners. You should probably dump all the losers regardless to free up capital for diversification.\n\nNow, how to diversify. That depends a lot on your time horizon and investment goals, but the general idea is to move your overweight in Tech towards the broader world-wide equity market, and add bonds and commodities to dilute the concentration of risk correlation in your current portfolio. 60/40 world equities/world bonds is a decent eventual asset mix to shoot for, but use an interactive asset mix calculator to find the mix that fits your goals best. I link a few below and the first link is the one I use myself.\n\nFor now, you can start slow by selling all your losers and however much of your winners net to zero cap gains after selling the losers, and use the freed up cash to buy VTI. That's only the US equity market, but it's a good place to start. If you want to go 60/40 VTI/BND, that would be fine too. Both are deeply discounted vs. 15 year averages right now, so you'll be getting bargain prices.\n\nYou can read more about asset class diversification and portfolio asset mix here:\n\nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio\n\nAsset allocation calculators:\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation\n\nhttps://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation\n\nhttps://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculator\n\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/tools-calculators/overview"

Tax loss harvesting\n\n2.) Use correlations to your advantage. For example, DXY and rates going up clobbers tech, so positions that profit in such an environment are a hedge against your current PF.\n\n3.) Short correlated indices using futures or ETFs. SQQQ, SARK,NOPE on the long side or short QQQ, ARKK, GK directly and use the cash to buy short term Tbills.\nTheres an \"Inverse Cramer\" ETF coming online next month.\n\n\nFortunately tech pays shit dividends so its a lot easier to short it and short term rates are high so you have some structural advantage here that we didnt have for a long time.\n\n\nSo step one would be harvest as much tax loss as you can and figure out how much gains you can net out. Then overlay the above suggestions to tweak how much beta you want to this market."

It's currently trading at 2030 and doesn't expire until next week so I'm wondering how to approach managing this.\\n\\nI was just considering selling put spreads at 2000 / 1990 to try to eke out some profit if the condor doesn't return to profitability (I didn't want to sell any higher so I wouldn't be betting against myself, but maybe that's not the right way to think about it?). Are there other strategies I should consider? I'm not too far from running into capital requirements in this account, too (AMZN's share price doesn't help these matters) so that's a consideration, as well. I guess I can also just close the positions, take my losses, and look for the next trade.\\n\\nAppreciate any insight, including just links to any articles that might address this scenario.

     "It is a typical move to create an iron butterfly, in the move you propose.  \n\nOften, traders will simultaneously create the iron butterfly, and roll the trade out in time, in hopes of catching a down move at some point in the future, after more than one roll out in time.   \n\nA balanced trade would result in 2000 / 2020 call side and put side 2000 / 1980  (20 points on each side).  You might find that you don't get much of a credit with 2000 / 1990, as you propose. \n\nOr you could roll the entire iron condor out in time, at the same location it presently is.  This has a smaller credit, or more likely a debit, but creates a larger future target, for when the underlying swings by in price. \n\nSometimes it is possible, for a credit, to move the whole position upward a strike, while rolling out it time. Play with the possibilities with your broker platform. \n\nI have met up with traders that successfully rolled a challenged trade, a number of times, for a credit each time, for as long as six months, and had the underlying swing by in price, and exit for a substantial gain, and reduced the loss each time with the credit for each rollout. \n\nGenerally, it's best to do this sooner rather than later. \n\n**For any of these positional moves, do this for a net credit**: this pays for the capital, and reduces the risk by reducing the net loss from the potential maximum loss over the series of trades.\n\nOr you could take your loss and move on."

     "It's never a bad idea to take profits! When you buy an option, you have to get both the direction and the timing right to make money. You got it right - I might take profits and re-establish a new position.\n\nBut if you want to keep your position on through earnings, let's talk through your scenario.\n\nCurrent position:\ndelta: +68\ntheta: -33\nvega: +147\n\nBasically, you want the price to go up, but you get hurt as time passes, and if IV decreases (which it will most likely do after earnings), you get hurt.\n\nIf you buy a put, you'll decrease your delta exposure, but you'll actually INCREASE your theta and vega exposure.\n\nIf you want to hedge, I would rather see you sell a call instead of buying a put since IV rank is fairly high (73) in there right now.\n\nFor example, if you sold the Aug 18 1070 call, your position will look like this:\ndelta: +38\ntheta: +13\nvega: +42\n\nThis reduces your delta exposure by 44%, so a price move (in either direction) has less of an impact on the value of your position. You're still bullish though - you want the price to go up. This actually REVERSES your theta - you're EARNING money over time rather than losing it. And it reduces your vega exposure by 74%, meaning if (when) you see a decrease in IV it will hurt you less than it would with just the long call.\n\nNobody has a crystal ball, so nobody is going to be able to tell you what approach is going to be better. This is just an idea.\n\nIf I were you, I'd take profits. If you want to play earnings in there, wait until the trading day just before earnings and put on a new position at that time, selling premium to take advantage of IV crush that earnings brings."

This is what I have come up with and I would like to hear your thoughts: \\nSell slightly in the money call on AMZN two weeks out, this typically pays a $40 premium. Buy a put $40 below call strike price which costs around $5. The goal is to hold for one week and based on my calculations this strategy produces a fairly flat profit with limited loss risk. If the underlying goes up $50 this produces a $2000 profit in one week and if it drops $50 or even more the loss is capped at around $1500. If underlying goes sideways and stays fairly flat this strategy pays around $1000. Obviously executing this strategy needs a big chunk of upfront money.

This strategy means your bearish on AMZN for the next 2 weeks, which I would highly advise against.\n\nYour losses are not capped at 1500 with this strategy, your losses could be very high ($10000 loss would not surprise me as AMZN usually moves at least 20-30$ everyday). In a calm market where underlying is 1-2$ below call strike at expiration you win $3500 (4000 premium - 500 for worthless put)."

AMZN is big.\n\nIf you insist, consider the put credit spread. One less leg, same risk reward. So sell the put at the strike you would sell the call, no stock, buy protective put at lower strike.\n\nYour numbers do not match what I see. A $5 put for June 28 is 70 points otm. Stock 1918, 1845 put is bid over $5. $35 call is strike 1900. So the risk is $55-$12 or $4300. Max profit is $1200. If market is efficient, you have about a 75 percent chance of winning, but max loss is triple max profit.\n\nMaybe paper trade it using market orders, see how it does. \n\nBut again, unless 100 AMZN shares is a small trade for you, a lower priced underlying is a better place to learn.

     "My suggestion to you is to play carefully and set your profit loss targets tight. \n\nJust keep in mind that many blue chip companies utilize revolving debt to fund and finance investment or reinvestment into the company regardless of how much cash they have on hand. \n\nWith rates looking like they will not let off, blue chips (along with every other company that uses leverage) have to find more ROI with the leverage they have but unfortunately a lot of them have optimized operation around cheap money for nearly a decade. \n\nWe might see some level of rebound tomorrow and in the coming weeks but unless a miracle drops out of the sky we\u2019re looking at an FED strategic slowdown and breakdown of asset prices across all categories that have seen large percentages of appreciation. \n\nMy plays currently are Spy puts with about 10% of my portfolio in short/medium term and long expiries. The rest of the 90 is all cash and ready to deploy.\n\nIf you look at housing purchase data, we\u2019re seeing a massive drop of origination rates for new home purchases indicating that consumers are starting to slow down. On the residential side we\u2019re seeing the slowdown of new money. This can broadly be applied to all loan origination (auto loans, personal loans etc\u2026) In the near to mid term, there will be less and less money being created and circulating to sustain our current asset prices. \n\nBasically the loans are starting to dry up that keep asset prices elevated. This is what we\u2019re starting to see with a lot of the earnings lately. Purchasing is slowing down and cost to operate is increasing thus shrinking to non existent profits\u2026 \n\nOn the long term side I have a hunch that due to the worsening environmental impacts were are witnessing around the world, a systematic slowdown of consumption to drastically slowdown spending to environmentally sustainable levels is on the radar. Whatever happens in between these points is the big ?"

I\u2019m very bullish on this stock so I was scared to employ a new strategy initially. I\u2019m glad I did though because I\u2019m learning a lot. Just 2 hours later I saw an article in the news tab announcing there was unusual options activity. Someone sold $5,294,036 worth of puts. I took a screenshot of the article and sent it to my dad cause it was reassuring to know I wasn\u2019t alone in deploying this strategy. I had told him what I wanted to do with the put selling weeks before all this happened and how I was just scared to try it even though I understood everything. I played the what if I lose all my shit and then some because I misunderstood the risk or premise of the strategy itself. Like I could\u2019ve bought straight shares like my dad did and now I have a tiny bit of fear about it. \n\nMy dad only has one strategy, buy low and sell high and it\u2019s gotten us in some sticky situations so I\u2019m constantly looking for ways to mitigate risk and one up him. \n\nHope my though process can show that you\u2019re not alone in that fear and what if crap. I think it really comes down to the timeframe and how badly you want to own the stock. \nIf you think this is advice then don\u2019t take it cause it wasn\u2019t.

     "Thanks for the replies. I'll address them all in one batch. For those that feel compelled to give me advice, I sell naked all the time, and leg in all the time. Most of the time it works, but sometimes high probability trades blow up.\n\nYes, risky. I think I was emboldened after my selling of GPRO strangles before earnings worked so well. Sometimes the market has to teach people a lesson. It was my turn today. I'm sure many other premium sellers got blown out of the water on AMZN, either before or after the news, but haven't reported it publicly. \n\nWhen markets move fast, it makes it that much harder to get in or out of positions, and spread orders can be twice as hard. If a person is unwilling to take the max loss on a spread and is forced out on a spread, taking market fills on both ends of a fast moving market can make my bad trade look like a spring picnic.\n\nAs for details, I sold the 540 puts for 50 cents when AMZN was at 567 and the 590 calls for 32 cents @559. The calls expired for a win, but the losing leg was covered at $3.65 @539. So no, it was not close to break even, with 82 cents of credit against $3.65 to cover. I wasn't too concerned about buying power, because it was a one day trade. It was going to work, and I'd get my buying power back, or I was going to get out. AMZN closed at $529.42, so had I held on until the last minute of trading, covering might have cost $10+, perhaps a full $11 with a market order to avoid assignment.\n\nSpreads have their own problems. I believe that in this case, most of the common spreads would have made the out come worse not better. It would have added another level of bid/ask spreads and commissions and not offered any real protection against what happened. The loss on my trade was less than $3 per unit. A three dollar wide spread on AMZN in a fast moving market is unlikely to be worth doing for retail traders. Someone did one $2.50 wide before earnings, but that was during a calm market time. Ten dollar wide, sometimes more, is common on a $500+ underlying, so max loss $10, plus another level of commissions and bid/ask friction.\n\nUnless a person is willing to take a max loss on the spread getting out in a fast market on expiration day is like walking through a mine field. Using spreads vs. selling naked, can help in case of a big gap, but the news was out and today was expiration day. I rightly thought the gaps were over. Unfortunately it was a trending move down during the last couple of hours. Trending moves are the enemy of most premium sellers."

From my point of view I'm done with the high fliers that aren't tied to fundamentals i.e. Amazon, Tesla, and Netflix. Those stocks could soar on just about anything so I'm sticking to OTM put spreads with plenty of days to manage it. And they need to be spread so you don't get caught when the market realizes $570 dollars on a stock that makes 25 cents per share isnt worth it. \n\nOn this earnings play you just can't get far enough OTM on the call side to make the premium worth it IMO. Maybe with a longer duration you could manage it and roll it into a winner but with an earnings play like this you have no duration so its so risky, at least that's my takeaway from this week. "

Basically, any balance of contracts that is nonzero is considered an \"open\" position.\n\nNext, consider wether the transaction you're placing brings your position count back to zero, or if it brings you to another count **from** zero.\n\nSo, using *5 contracts* as an example:\n\n- for orders marked \"sell to open\", your position count will go from 0, to -5 short contracts\n- for \"sell to close\", the count goes from +5 long contracts to 0\n- for \"buy to open\", the count goes from 0 to +5 long contracts\n- for \"buy to close \" the count goes from -5 short contracts to 0\n\nFor the AMZN example you posted, you didn't say wether they were calls or puts or where the strikes are relative to the underlying, but:\n\nThe first example order in which you're selling to open and buying to close at the same time looks like a rolling order where you buy to close on the $80 strike ($80 strike count going from -1 to 0)  and sell to open the $100 strike ($100 strike count going from 0 to -1). At the end, you'll only have one open short contract.\n\nThe second example is more like a vertical spread. You're selling to open the $100 strike ($100 strike count going from 0 to -1) and buying to open the $80 strike ($80 strike count going from 0 to +1). The net result is two open contracts, one short, one long."

It has been ITM a couple times since, but the high price of the option has kept it far from its b/e price of $98 and I kept it open.

Theta decay is at about $0.09 right now and it's about to pick up steam.\\n\\nAs I've thought this through, I see this as a good strategy, now and going forward.

     "That\u2019s literally the point of selling covered calls. You\u2019re selling potential upside for income and some downside protection. If you\u2019re fine selling your shares at $93, then keep selling the calls. Like you said, the worst that\u2019ll happen is that you get the shares called away and keep the premiums in the meantime. On the other hand, if you\u2019re going to be kicking yourself or buying back in higher if Amazon goes to $115 and you sold for $93, then covered calls are less desirable. Aside from that, the risk of covered calls is the same as the risk of owning the shares outright. They could see a 30% decline, and the calls will maybe save you 5% of that. Either you\u2019ll end up selling calls that are below your cost basis, or you\u2019ll end up selling calls above your cost basis that are basically worth nothing. If Amazon goes to $75, those 93 calls aren\u2019t gonna be worth much. Other than that, pretty low risk play. \n\nPs, if you sell the 93 calls for $5, the break even on that is $98, not $103 :)"

Once the binary event is known to be positive/negative, implied volatility 'crushes' which deflates much of the value of your options.\n\nIf you bought the Feb 3 $890 calls, your breakeven would be $892.50 (strike price ($890) + premium paid ($2.50) = $892.50\n\nThat's a pretty sizeable move to breakeven. Doesn't mean it can't happen. AMZN has made some pretty wild swings post-earnings but the odds are against you. "

     "ATM options on expiration day behave funny. retail platforms don't often display them correctly. If you bought at strike price 1002.5 and you paid 1.90 for the contract your breakeven is 1004.4 on the stock. I show AMZN closing at 1006.7, grossing you about $230. Lastly, as it is a paper account (and even more specifically since it is OptionsHouse, a broker I have personal experience with) I can tell you that their price quotes are generally pretty incorrect in real-time. AI don't see anywhere in your screenshot where it says \"equity delayed quotes\" when you only have a paper acc with them - do you have a funded account with them? It may be that you're getting real time quotes and the quotes from the paper trade side are still being calculated with a 30 minute delay. \n\nIn your paper account wait until tomorrow to get assigned the shares. Academically speaking the math is never wrong and is easy to calculate for yourself - in this rare instance you are right and the computer is wrong. \n\nEDIT: just checked TastyWorks - that exact call closed with a bid/ask of 2.50/4.50 - I would imagine the fill price if you had closed this afternoon to be around 2.5 if you had really bought that option in real life and held to expiry.

You still have gamma and other risks. \n\nTake your example of having sold amazon puts. If you sold calls also, you might balance the delta in a static state, but not if the volatility or price change. If price goes way low, the premium from short call is insufficient to cover the loss.  If price goes way up, you are also exposed to loss from the short call (which you would otherwise not have had)."

     "You can do all the variants you described (sell calls on the same underlying or beta weight), but most commonly delta hedging is done using shares of the underlying stock, for example by selling 30 shares, so that you can frequently adjust the number of shares and stay neutral while otherwise the delta would be changing.. Some firms adjust their delta/shares every few minutes, others daily. A better example would be buying a wide call spread during high IV spike, then sell shares against that spread and wait for IV to drop or wait for the time to pass. Other times at high IV you may sell a call and buy corresponding number of shares. At low IV you could buy a straddle and neutralize it further with shares, wait for IV to spike, in which case delta hedging will result in gamma scalping (collecting profit from higher vol). While mainly delta hedging is a form of harvesting alpha (profit) while neutralizing beta (correlation to the underlying). Let\u2019s say someone tells you that they can make 20%/year more than holding the stock, by using the wheel or some other way of collecting theta or any other strategy. So then you\u2019d ask them why aren\u2019t they delta hedging to eliminate their risk thus collecting pure 20% profit without depending on the underlying stock. (the answer is that they have no clue what they\u2019re doing and they can\u2019t beat the underlying because they rely on it by not delta hedging and thus their P&L moving proportionally to the delta, which is highly correlated to the underlying)."

     "For me, I often have a target delta in mind when getting in. As the underlying moves, any delta from options may change. \n\nI may go in and want to be near delta neutral, or net long, or net short. \n\nTo give an example, say I do a covered call on Apple. In the example, I buy 100 shares and sell a 20 delta call one month out. This initial position is equivalent to being long 80 shares. \n\nIf Apple stock goes down, the delta on the out of the money call goes down. I might roll the call down and out to stay near the initial 80 delta. \n\nIf instead, Apple rallies I might roll the sold call out and up to maintain roughly 80 delta. Micro adjustments tend to be counter productive for retail traders. \n\nOverall delta on different underlyings tends to be best calculated with SPY beta weight. Thinkorswim provides this number. In essence it takes a snapshot of the entire portfolio and equates it to a number of SPY shares, net long or short or perhaps near neutral. \n\nThe beta weight gives a rough idea of risk. If trading very short term options, gamma risk can be significant. Gamma measures the change in delta. \n\nThe rabbit hole can get quite deep. It takes an average person about 1000 hours and a year to get to apprentice level. That\u2019s a mix of study and tiny live trading.  Of course some do it much quicker, but some are also slower."

     "So many \"experts\" on here, none of which are answering the questions OP asked, which implies that 99% of the forum full with clueless \"traders\" who have not read up on a basic like delta hedging.\n\nFirst, forget about TT and the losers Sosnoff and whatever else on there. They are perpetually short the market, and none of them show actual P/L, because they are losers. Sosnoff has been nearly bankrupt several times an lucked out by selling TOS to TDA. As a trader, he made money as market makers when \"a train could drive through the spreads\" in other words, when they bought near the bid and sold near the ask all day long. This was the coked up 80s, and that time s long gone.\n\nNow onto your questions...First, you need to learn about delta hedging by reading books and some online material. Even a single google search reveals what this means https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_neutral - you are trying to achieve zero delta on the portfolio, whether on a single underlyer or multiple underlyings.\n\n\"For example, if I sell a 30d put on AAPL, I'll be long 30d. And if I do that for another 2 stocks for eg, META & AMZN, I'll be long 90d in total.\"\n\nCorrect. You need to sum all deltas, including the shares you own (100 shares are 100 delta), to get to total delta.\n\n\"Now in order to \"manage delta\" does that mean I should sell some calls as well to make it delta neutral? When I sell the calls, should I sell against the same underlyings as my long delta or can I just use beta weighted delta against spy to hedge the delta?\"\n\nYou can sell calls with a total of 90 delta, or sell 90 shares of stock. This is where it gets interesting. You can sell 30 shares of each of the 3 stocks you sold puts on, or you can calculate the correlation of the stocks you sold, and or the correlation to the index that is most representative (SPY, or even QQQ) and then sell the deltas according to that correlation calculation. If the correlation is near 1 among all your choices, then you can either sell calls with a total of 90 delta, or 90 shares of your mix of stocks or index.\n\n\"Also, the reason for this I presume is to not be directional and let theta do it's work?\"\n\nThe reason for this is to decrease directional exposure. Theta has nothing to do with it.\n\nDelta hedging works in both ways - start with a underlying position, then use options to neutralize delta, OR start with options and then use the underying and/or other options to neutralize total delta.\n\nFor instance, you can start with long shares, and then sell covered calls in a delta neutral manner. Like, you own 100 shares of SPY, and then sell 1 ATM call, which carries a negative 50 delta, so you are now at 50 delta, vs. earlier 100 delta.\n\nAgain, study. Forget what I wrote, and find it in books, with better explanations and examples by good selling authors. The forums are full of idiots who think they can get rich with GME calls, so read everything here with a grain of salt.\n\nGood luck."

     "Part of managing delta is opening new positions such as selling some calls to be mostly delta neutral as you suggested.\n\nAnother aspect of managing delta is adjusting positions as needed.  If I sell a 30d AAPL strangle with 45DTE and during the first week it moves to one of my short strikes I may roll the untested strike to adjust (manage) my delta.  Assuming AAPL moves up to my short call now I'm short the 50d call and maybe my short put is now 10d.  To manage this I might roll my short put up to somewhere around 30d so my net delta is 20 instead of 40."

     "If it is fact a debit spread then the fact it went through both strikes is good for you. You can and should close it Thu or Fri (latest) to realize the full or very close to full profit. \n\nNot sure what you mean by $12 profit. In dollar terms, the spread is $250 wide. You, let's say, paid $100 for it. You should profit $150 which is $250 max value of the spread minus your debit (which I'm just guessing was $100). \n\nYou can avoid assignment and should be closing this profitable trade before close on Friday. To avoid the earnings gamble, I would close it tomorrow before earnings report and just take the profits even if it's not reach max profit yet. "

     "Selling puts in a bear market takes balls. Or stupidity. Or maybe those are the same thing?\n\nI'm frankly surprised you ever made money selling puts on those straight-down tickers this year. How did you select strikes (what delta?) and what DTE?\n\nI'm not a fan of rolling for the sake of rolling. You need to have ever increasing confidence in the probability and size of profit to roll. Like if your original goal was a 70% chance to make $100, if you roll, you need to have an 80% chance to make $120 (net of the loss on the roll, so if you opened for a $100 credit then had to pay $169 to close for a -$69 loss, you have to make $189 on the new contract to net a $120 credit on the roll), and if you roll again, a 95% chance to make $150 (net net).\n\nMore about rolling here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourroll"

The only thing you give up is leverage. \n\nThe only time I've traded options with more than 60 DTE is for synthetic stock, and the only reason I didn't just buy shares was because of nasty tax consequences of those particular shares, like having to file a K-1.\n\n\"Once the market reaches bottom\" made my lol, btw. Since you seem to realize no one knows when that will happen, what is your entry strategy? I favor just closing my eyes and picking an entry point, if it goes down after that, fml, but for me it feels worse to wait too long and miss the recovery, which can turn around by 30% in less than a day.

So in essence, the stock price, strike price and premium in which you enter the options contract is critical to making a profit. \n\nStocks are safer than options, but individual stocks carry their own risk. However, you don't have the time risk of expiry, so if you believe in that company you can hold until you want to / can sell.\n\nThe way I see LEAPs is to enter into a contract only when there is a good margin of error, same as stocks, that at least you'll breakeven, so as to not lose your premium."

     "I see from your other comments that you are looking for underlings that are on the lower side. \n\nFirst off, I would always suggest choosing solid companies. Some underlying offer great IV%, but that is typically for a reason. \n\nIf you get caught holding garbage, the risk of never recovering is greater.\n\nAdditionally, this may not be short put environment. The market has been on a clear down turn, and we have not yet had confirmation of recovery. I highly suggest you take this into consideration and adjust your trading strategies accordingly. We have had a few days of green, but there are still leading indicators that the market has more to fall. I could be wrong, but I could be right. My point is, don't try to time the market. Wait for confirmations and trade the opportunities the market gives you. Don't try to force the strategy you know. \n\n\nSome I would suggest looking into are below. Keep in mind these are only suggestions for you to look into. My perspectives could be different from yours, or could be flat out wrong. \n\nF, Ford is a solid company long term. They may be one of the better positioned established vehicles companies to take on the EV market. Price levels before COVID crash was about $9.80. The Sept monthly 10P is going for 0.33 at 19 delta. I would suggest waiting for a market pull back to sell, as we are just in a few green days in a row. You could also turn this into a spread to reduce the buying power required by 50% while only giving up 10% premium. \n\n\nPLTR might be at a consolidated price (for now). It seems to be riding the $8-9 range. The premiums are good for the price level, and the company has little debt with substantial cash. As the fed hikes prices, growth becomes more difficult for companies across the border. Ideally their cash holdings will let them continue to operate at growth levels without worrying about the increase to cost of acquiring capital. Their earnings is soon, so you may want to wait for confirmation of this thesis from Q2 results/guidance.\n\nCLF, X are two steel companies I have been trading for the last year or so (typically strangles). They have always been liquid for me, and a good contender. BUT, we are facing potential recession dynamics which will cause commodities to drop in demand, and this the related producers will have their stock values decrease. Now might not be the time to trade short puts on these, but I do think they are worth the mention to add to your list for future candidates. \n\nCCL, Carnival Cruise Lines. Oh my. What to say. They are near COVID crash lows os 7.80 and trading at 9.15. They are riddled with debt. But, if you believe in the cruise market this may be a good candidate with higher risks. A Sept 7.5P trades for 0.66 at 24 delta. Assignment gives you a cost basis of 6.84, while COVID low was 7.80. You can also turn this into a spread, reducing the buying power reduction by 33% and premium received by 8%. This has the same risks of recession, and oil prices highly impact this market. Maybe now is the time, maybe not.\n\nGOEV, Cannot EVs. This is a much riskier trade as it is a newly publicly traded company and is an EV startup. They have been trending down, but recently announced a contract with Walmart to provide them 4500 EV's. Two days later they announced the military is accepting an undisclosed number of vehicles to consider them for future contracts. IV has shot up, and this might provide a speculative opportunity. The Sept 2.5P is trading at 0.22 at 13 delta. The Aug options chain will have more strokes available on Monday. I would suggest letting their price fall a bit before considering a trade. Again, this one is riskier and more speculative. Could be a bag holder here. \n\n\nAgain, I suggest treading carefully here and choosing stocks you would be happy holding for a good amount of time in the event of economic recession. We haven't had confirmation of market recovery, so more down turn is still a plausible outcome."

All trading is super easy in hindsight, not so easy in real time. No one knows which way AMZN is going to go, though they may have an opinion, may have a position.\n\n99.99% of options that are ITM by even a penny will be assigned on an actively traded underlying like AMZN. As for your odds for next week, if your platform doesn't show probabilities, it probably shows delta. The chance of ITM is approximately the delta of your option. "

Then you have to start gambling on your stock *not* recovering above your cost basis for the duration of the short call hold. That's not a great place to be for a long shares trader. \n\nProbably one of the biggest mistakes you can make, when holding growth stocks for the long term, is to bet against their recovery.\n\nIf the only thing you can trade is CCs, maybe don't use options at all.

     "It\u2019s a tough spot to be in. Been there often, and as someone already replied, your broker is making it worse. You desperately need to be able to wheel, but better is the permission to execute calendar calls or diagonal calls for credit. In a calendar or diagonal spread you simultaneously buy back your (cheaper) expiring call and sell the new one next week (or month) at the same or higher strike to lower both your basis and your risk and work yourself out of the hole. This works for csp as well. If your broker doesn\u2019t allow these basic tools you need to have a heart to heart with them on the phone and insist on it. They are destroying your position in otherwise tradable and profitable options. I\u2019ve been in the hole for weeks and months at a time. But I can roll weekly calendar calls just otm (or even just itm) and take in 1-2% premium every week. And I always have the option of rolling a 2-3 week diagonal (with minimal credit or debit) taking those weeks off and coming back with a better strike. Not fun, but it saves money in the long run. Or I can just take the miserable assignment and roll csp. Whatever your choice, you need these tools. Explain it to your broker and insist on them.\n\nI hate monthlies and leaps btw. They have their unique place and purpose, but earning money isn\u2019t one of them. The premiums over time are far too small for the risk to your position. A lot can happen in a month, let alone a year. Rolling weeklies you pick up 1/2-2% a week with fast decay, which easily beats a 3 month contract. Also it is cheaper and easier to exit or adjust your position in an emergency."

My scalps are super small now $10-$100/day I\u2019ve taking the capital gained from my \u201chot steak\u201d and started to trade spreads heavily for the moment. My gains are low but steady. Trying to build a new cash balance to start scalping heavily with again. Emotions are crazy in this game I love you repeat your rules every day, a true legend of a tip everyone should strive to do myself included. Just remember emotions can creep in any time. I hate losing and that one day I ignored my rules and lost bigger than I planned scared me a bit. First when I broke my rules, and second by making me timid of trying again\u2026"

And he has to take time out of his busy day to say you said its JUST NOW getting alot of attention. Don't worry, anyone out there that's not a complete retard( no offensive to people with disabilities) understands what you meant.  By the way, thank you for posts. I wish there were more poeple out there willing to help other. I don't care even if you did eventually want to sell something. I would definitely pay you $50 a month for daily buy and sell alerts when you are going to buy an option. If what your doing is working, so the hell what if you wanted to make money by helping others who are still learnig. It's the AMERICAN WAY! But I suppose it's ALSO the American way to want someone to do all the work for them for FREE while they sit on there ass and enjoy all the rewards that they didn't work for. Are there brokerage account making nothing off them? I don't think so. Anyways, I thought your post was very insightful and I appreciate people like you that are quite obviously trying to use your experiences to mentor others so maybe they can try your strategy and see if it works for them. Anybody thats not a complete idiot could see that if you were just trying to show off you wouldn't have taken the time to answer people's questions and try to help them out. You would've just posted the screenshots and said look at me. Anyway thanks for taking your time to try to explain things a little for people that might want to try what's working for you."

Trying to work on my mentality.\n\nSince you also use think or swim, how do you execute bailing out on unfavorable trades ? Ie they go red as soon as you enter them ? Equity has stop loss price, how to execute the same on options ? \n\nAlso can you post your trading rules that you repeat to your self ?

As of now the only way I know how to come across a ticker that I should look into is second hand. Mostly wsb. Those are a mostly pump and dumps and gambles but I justify it as I\u2019m not buying and walking away right now I have the time to keep a close eye on charts. As I\u2019ve taken a major interest in tA. I know that\u2019s often times subjective and not always reliable i want to get better at other types of information gathering.

     "Hey OP, thank you for your encouraging & motivating post. The key takeaways for me are consistency & making small gains over time. I realize that the bigger risk I take, the more emotional & irrational I become. I like the idea of 1-3 contracts. What really encouraged me was reminding me of how I began trading options with a small dollar amount in my account & grew my account decently. As my account grew, though, I ended up sinking it because I got over confident & took out too large of trades (& lost). The majority of my account now is \u201cBuy & Hold\u201d stock, but I am slowly dipping my feet back into options. I am starting to do options again, but allotting only a few hundred dollars until I can start showing regular success on my options trading. Thanks again. And please don\u2019t listen to people giving you grief about not being more specific. I know my own options strategy, so I don\u2019t need to know the exact specifics of your strategies. Thank you again. I appreciate your post. God bless you."

     "Just as I suspected, the bid/ask is the issue.  Far OTM options are usually low liquidity.  Today's volume on this option is 1--that's right, today, you were the only person to trade an AMZN 1/19/24 212.5 strike call!  Such illiquid options usually have a very wide bid/ask and may even have no bid, which is the case here.  The bid is 0 and the ask is 4.10, which is the price you paid.\n\nAfter-hours options quotes aren't valid since the market is closed, so this situation might rectify itself Tuesday, but if the bid remains 0, it's difficult to accurately value this option, because the zero bid means you can't sell it.  No one is willing to buy it.\n\nI can't explain why Robinhood is telling you the value is $1.  Normally if brokerage platforms display only one price, they display the mid, which is halfway between the bid and ask, which would be 2.05 in this case.\n\nEven very liquid options have much wider bid/ask spreads than stocks.  You always have to look at the bid/ask spread when trading options.  It wouldn't surprise me if the egregious Robinhood hides this from you, but surely even they must provide a way for you look it up."

You'll find out if your analysis was correct sometime in late 2023 going into the Jan 24 exp date.\n\nRobinhood does not show the mid-price of options, so this is why many get confused like you are here.  There was even a young trader who misunderstood what RH shows to where this happened - [https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/06/17/20-year-old-robinhood-customer-dies-by-suicide-after-seeing-a-730000-negative-balance) \n\nIf you want to trade options in a serious way then get off of RH as soon as you can.\n\nLooking at thinkorswim it shows this call option has a Bid of $0 and an Ask of $4.10 where you bought the option.  The mid-price which may be considered its current value is showing at $2.05.  This wide bid-ask spread is a clear indication the option has little interest or volume and should be considered illiquid.  \n\nYour option will likely trade somewhere around this $2.05 price next week for about a 50% loss since you overpaid for it to begin with.  \n\nBesides having to wait until Jan 24 to see if your premise was correct, you significantly overpaid for this option meaning the stock will have to move up a lot just to get back to what you paid.   \n\nYou've made the trade and can now just check it every month or two through the end of 2023 to see how it is performing if AMZN climbs in price.  \n\nClose it at the profit or loss target amounts you set up before opening the trade.  You did set profit and loss target amounts before opening the trade, right??"

     "I've been running a wheel strat for almost a quarter now. Here's what I've noticed:\n\nOpening- buy/write\n\nI use short time frames, weeklies, except usually for my Core positions, one's I'd rather hold. I like to get as much downside protection as possible at open. ATM. My goal is 3%/week, and I'm averaging 3.3% in closed positions so far. \n\nI account for my premium in position until closed. There are times when some has to be given back durring quick upswings in underlying. For much of last quarter many positions went negative as underlyings fell. I was able to keep up with price drops fairly effectively, but had to sell calls lower than my cost basis and risk assignment to get decent premiums. \n\nMy goal is stack premiums against loss of value in underlying, and keep as much as possible durring rebounds. At a ~10% premium on a just OTM call to open on a weekly, I'll see +13% upon assignment, in a week. Yay to that. Even if every once in a while they blow past it.\n\nCurrent open positions:\n\nWKHS\nSKLZ\nMVIS\n\nPlanning to open 2-3 more on Monday\n\nLast week closed: FCEL, NKLA, BB, AMC\nAverage position time: 2-3months\n\nNote on risk against underlying \"mooning\"\nAMC I sold at 17STK while it's price 5Xed. I got over 100% on position so not mad. I had returned ~40% in premium alone before assignment. When that rise began I think I was at a 13STK and able to roll up to 17 before it wasn't worth it anymore to me. WKHS I had to pay back a bunch of my premium to close out durring last rip, got it all back next contract at better STK. Best protection against that is to create an independent position, I call my Core. You can do this by using a percentage of your premium to build position over time. High IV I occasionally sell against part of my Core holdings. Last month alone WKHS popped quickly twice and I was able to sell far OTM Calls against half of my Core position for roughly 5% ROI for entire Core position each time. It has to be worth it to me to risk some of my Core and at a STK I am comfortable selling it at. \n\nSpeculation comes into play, but I'm enjoying this strat as I collect real cash for my positions. Short time frames gives me a lot of flexibility. Compound those percentages over the year and it really does add up. These positions alone returned ~+10% my entire account this quarter, with another 10% still accounted for in open positions."

I\u2019ve thought about covered calls, but never had the guts to do it, because the stock tends to move in unpredictable (to me) surges. I feared losing it and being unable to get back in at an affordable price, as I still think it is a great investment with ongoing huge growth potential. I\u2019ve also considered buying leaps, and I think your idea is a great one, and the only way that I would consider selling calls on AMZN. The price can fluctuate by hundreds of dollars in a matter of days though, so keep that in mind. It has been both a thrilling and sometimes gut-wrenching hold at times over the last 20 years, but still holding, and so glad I held."

But before you learn.how to limit the beast you must start with understanding and mastering the understanding of each side.\n\nOnce you perfectly understand one option symbol as far as price action movement versus time and approximately what each option would produce as a result of the price action. Then you understand all individual options. \n\nAfter the individual understandings of the mathematical consistencies then you can compare to other stocks, realizing option price versus stock size at the money options is the best way to compare the two most comparable option chains. Then you see how much riskier volatility makes the stock prices. So they drive the prices up to drive up the IV crash down to rob the bag holders and then build narratives around the next burst and continually suck from society.  \n\nAnyways, there is also a world of opportunity for sellers of the world that just like sound math and historical back testing certainties.  Selling calls and puts with months to expire in the SPY and anytime a big move happens you add another leg and then another and you set each bet to a maximum of 3-10% of your account balance,  you will at least double money yearly. \n\nAnyone that wants to build the perfect stock market money algo the answer is simple and it's a cross margin credit spread between the SPY and SPX options, using the dividend date of the spy you can see the pattern in the spread of the stock prices and constantly find opportunities that based on the spread expected you can set up a credit larger than the spread and sometimes by large margins, and based off the logic you should be able to double money quarterly and the potential should be near infinite because the system is designed to be liquid to anyone as much as they can afford. \n\nI'm more worried about my American rights and responsibilities other the money,  so if you have any specific questions or think I missed a spot let me know."

     "You have the right idea.  Without day trades though you will want to do further expiration options and specifically spreads will give you a much higher chance of success.  For the most part buying a $10 individual option on SPY is throwing away that $10 to theta burn quickly but if you use a $10 spread you will be much closer to the money, the premium will move slower, and your chance of success will be much higher.\n\nI would personally recommend risking slightly more than that and just watching it for a $10 stop loss.  For example if you sell a $30 credit spread that is a $70 risk technically but as long as you are far dated you could buy back the position at $40 for a $10 loss.  There is a chance it could blow past your strikes after hours and you will need to buy it back for a bigger loss ($70 being the max loss) but if you sell these a month or two out that will be far less likely."

Even a stop loss of 10% is likely a bit too small, since at the money leaps 1 year out are leveraged at 4x to 5x, that translate to 2% move in the underlying for a 10% move in options\u2026\n\nAlso beware that options usually have a large spread, and brokers don\u2019t always mark the options price the same way. Some brokers use last trade price, some use the bidding price, some use mid price between ask and bid and other uses more complex algorithms. (The best estimate is usually the mid price between ask and bid). As a result, your stop loss might get triggered early by mistake."

So, for example, a 1 ATM < 4 DTE SPX Put Credit spread has a risk ratio of 1:1.5, or $200/$300. Say you put the GTC stop loss order (to avoid max loss), keeping your risk 1:1. Say you enter every Monday at market open (blindly), for that Friday's expiration, by end of that week you'll either have made $200 or lost $200. Won't make or break ya, but still keep you involved.\n\nCould also do SPY or XSP ATM weekly Put credit spreads  for $45/$55. I mean yeah, it's only $45-$50 per week but i like to think of it as \"beer money\" and it's just a way to get engaged in the market without all the drama.\n\nI've been trading using these low risk methods for years, with relative success. i still work full time, often dealing with clients so it's important for me to keep my head cool and not be all anxious over my trading activity. \ud83d\ude05"

     "Hey guys, I am pretty new here so I can\u2019t post but I want to ask about how I lost money on my Netflix strangle with a huge price drop after the earning call.\n\nSo I bought 500 put and 600 call on 4/20 when Netflix stock price was 550. 500 put costs 2.42 and 600 call costs 3.5 with expiration date 4/23. During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. \n\nNext day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.\n\nFrom my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.\n\nI consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?"
