If you think with 1 hour of research you figured what the market is missing, then I have a flying bridge to sell you.\n\nCyclical pharmaceutical company with lots of uncertainties. Unless you understand their whole portfolio of drugs, your analysis is rubbish. Literally half to PFE revenue last year are COVID related."

On another thread I suggested I might come off as a shill, but the reason I've stayed in is that it has a decent yield on the dividend (.39 / qtr / \\~4.5% annually) and now at the current price, you have an opportunity for significant > SP movement. Price has behaved differently last few days, which is to say good. Don't know if MM manipulation behind us (it never really is) but at least price was free to move up.  When they post Q1 results it's very likely price will move up again as the benefit of a full qtr of vaccine rev/profit will reveal itself. And not being a one-trick pony, PFE has much to crow about of late, e.g., cancer drug and FDA approval 3/3. And. by the way, the PFE vaccine is hands-down the best of the vaccines with gov'ts worldwide buying in... Brazil may be next. I like the where it's going."

     "OP DD is lacking, but the vaccine *may* be bigger than people expect (currently common sentiment is it\u2019s worth nothing and can\u2019t move the stock, as can be seen by other comments on this thread). In early February, projected 2020 revenues from the vaccine were $15B, with 20-30% margins and half of profits shared w Biontec. ~$2B is over 20% of their 2020 income. Since that projection, 500M+ orders came in, so at minimum revenues will be $20B. If a booster is required, it will be their most profitable treatment (currently pneumovax).\n\nThe viatris spinoff may seem like a negative at face value, but most would view it as a positive (after all, this is why Pfizer chose to spin them off). Viatris only holds off patent drugs, and was decreasing profits every year. Having shed the slowly dying Viatris, the expectation is for Pfizer to grow. W 80+ drugs in pipeline, 30+ phase 3 or just past phase 3, and covax goodwill likely improving their ability to raise drug prices, I like the odds."

     "The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn\u2019t fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don\u2019t realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.  \n     This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out."

     "My beaten up portfolio is now pretty much almost dead, my hard earned money gone. Someone told me earlier that retail investors only exist to get r\\*ped by algos and major players. I have been investing for years and my portfolio has never been green despite  being in pretty much only vanguard mutual funds and some tech growth starting in 2020. I honestly wish I had never touched investing in my life, if I had never invested my money I would have more money now than before I started \"investing.\" The stock market is a scam and a failure. Retail just exists to be liquidity for big player exit moves. I am honestly in a complete depression after losing like 20% of my money in the last two years and this is simultaneous to me quitting my job in a few weeks because it is too mentally degenerative. I have wasted so much time watching the market and looking into financial stuff, and so much emotional stamina dealing with the mostly downcoaster, so much time and mental health could have been saved if I just never invested anything at all, never researched any tickers, just put everything into series i bonds and hysa. I hate my life and how I am doomed to struggle forever in the dark, the only thing keeping me going is the thought that I can still take out a loan and go back to school full time and try to do it all over again but this time with a high income salary as a foundation.  \n\n\nedit: downvoted for being a loser i already know"

If I do nothing, will my shares disappear and my account credited at $48/share? That would mean a guaranteed 3.3% growth in that holding between now and the buyout. Is it worth selling now and reinvesting into a different holding that might yield better than 3.3%? Is there any chance the buyout might not go through and ARRY crashes back down to where it was prior to the buyout announcement?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks in advance for taking the time.\"",

     "As usual everyone isn\u2019t looking at the big picture. Todays sell off is simply the beginning of the downturns in the markets. F Amazon. F Apple. F the fangs and look out below. Stubborn inflation will result in all stocks being downgraded until we have a 12 PE ( or worse ) and interest rates about 5 percent ( or higher) and people start getting laid off. Anecdotal stories of the housing markets are JUST starting! I suspect the October GDP will not only show another downturn but according to the third time in a row it represents a depression. There are too many people betting on a pivot, a turnaround, a sudden miracle where the markets will suddenly go up. Not happening. The VIX had to hit higher than 40 ( doesn\u2019t mean a capitulation) and can go higher still. Higher interest rates will send NASDAQ below 10k to 9500, a 40% decline ( not unusual for these stocks) and an SPX below 3400.  This is a bear market. Cash is king. Listening to those long term pundits who won\u2019t care about the pain you are suffering only means they want your assets so they can profit on your portfolios. But then again, what\u2019s going on may be too late for most of us. After all, new investors ( all you kids 40 years old and younger ) all believe in buying the dips. After your lessons this year and next you can learn what it means to be \u201cprudent\u201d."

     "Decent pullback today (by volatile, 2022 standards) on near-average volume across the majors. Both SPY & QQQ remained within what could become an inside bar if the pattern matures -- more so than a bull flag at this point.\r  \n\r  \nSPY's price action was more interesting by comparison due to its pullback coming close to the minor support trendline -- 397.90 will need to hold tomorrow for the bulls\r  \n\r  \nQQQ has more room below at 279.97 for the bulls to hold its inside bar. Regardless, the bulls do not have much room to the upside on either SPY or QQQ, so any breakout will likely be limited, if one comes at all.\r  \n\r  \nIWM pulled back a full percentage point more than SPY. Often a 'leading indicator,' the IWM fell to nearly close below what still may be an inside bar pattern, but given today's price action, more likely suggests a break to the downside. Bulls need 180.70 to hold."

The stock price chart will show you what you will get, a flat return with someday a chance to sell at a small peak. Buy a real package delivery company like Fedexx or UPS.\n\nLSI, keep - strong company again\n\nSTM, keep - I know a lot about semi's but not this one. Think their market will rebound quickly. IDK why yahoo finance could not give a current ratio?? \n\nPERI, keep - not my style of industry but again great fundamentals\n\nTesla, sell - I've been a naysayer of the stock for a long time. The company is fine for now, their stock is just super overpriced. Doesn't follow any type of logic in valuation. Decent product but big car companies will crush them in a couple years when EU makes electric the standard and they produce at scale. They are trying to get value out of their old factories and systems while they can. If Toyota swaps production to 100% electric they'd be out of business in EU and Asia within a year.\n\nTecnoglass, keep - fck me I gotta buy or put it on my watchlist\n\nCrocs, keep? - I admire them for reinventing their product, but fashion changes. I'd keep a close eye on this one if it ever runs high or reports less results.\n\n  \nACLS, keep - IDK which suppliers to fabs will do well but I imagine any one that has a salesperson that can breathe and a decent product will sell well once the trillions of investments + stimulus kicks in\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople don't reply to your post in my eyes because they only like the quick and sensational BS.

     "good morning traders! here are your early movers on this tuesday-\n\n> **BP** - reported quarterly earnings of $2.57 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $2.239 billion. Nevertheless, that result is well-below the $3.22 billion reported in the same period last year. The stock was up about 2 percent in premarket trading.\n\n> **Ford Motor** - shares tumbled nearly 2 percent ahead of the bell after the automaker reported earnings that were below Wall Street's estimates, citing fewer vehicles sales in North America due to the rollout of the F-150 pickup truck and continued to lose money in South America and Europe.\n\n> **Bristol-Myers Squibb** - shares rose nearly 2 percent in premarket trading after reporting quarterly profits of 71 cents per share, well-above analysts' forecast of 51 cents. The pharmaceutical giant also reported revenue of $4.04 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of $3.80 billion.\n\n> **Merck** - beat Wall Street's estimates after posting adjusted quarterly profits of 85 cent per share on revenue of $9.4 billion, sending the stock up more than 4.5 percent in premarket trading. Analysts expected the company to report earnings per share of 75 cents on revenue of $9.1 billion.\n\n> **Pfizer**'s - stock traded slightly lower ahead of the bell after lowering its 2015 guidance for earnings per share and revenue. The pharmaceutical giant also reported quarterly adjusted profits of 51 cent per share on revenue of $10.86 billion, both of which beat Wall Street estimates.\n\n> **United Parcel Service** - shares rose more than 1 percent after reporting quarterly profits of $1.12 per share, slightly above analysts' forecasts. Nevertheless, the package delivery giant also posted quarterly revenues of $13.97 billion, below Wall Street's forecast of $14.27 billion.\n\n> **Coach** - reported adjusted quarterly earnings of 36 cents per share, slightly above consensus estimates. Its revenue, however, came in at $929 million, below Wall Street's forecast of $950 million. The handbag maker's stock plunged about 7 percent ahead of the bell.\n\n> **Aetna** - reported quarterly operating earnings of $2.39 per share, well-above analysts' forecast of $1.95, citing increasing membership since the end of 2014. The U.S.' third-largest health insurer also increased its full-year guidance.\n\n> **Apple** - shares rose more than 2 percent ahead of the opening bell as the tech giant carried over its acquired momentum from Monday's earnings report. The company reported quarterly earnings per share of $2.33 on revenue of $56.08 billion, both above consensus estimates. Apple also said it would expand its capital return program to $200 billion from $130 billion."

     " Pfizer\u2013The drug maker earned 57 cents per share, excluding certain items, for the first quarter, two cents above estimates. Revenue, though, fell short of consensus, as sales weakened in its two largest units. Separately, the company may need to raise its $106 billion offer for AstraZeneca by up to 10 percent, according to analysts. Pfizer's bids for the British drug maker have already been rejected three times.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\u2013The energy producer beat estimates by five cents with first quarter profit of $1.75 per share, excluding certain items, helped by the company's oil and gas operations.\n\nTyson Foods\u2013The food producer earned 60 cents per share for the fiscal second quarter, missing estimates by three cents. Revenue, however, did exceed expectations, and the company said it is pleased with the quarter despite challenges posed by factors such as the severe winter weather.\n\nZumiez\u2013Piper Jaffray upgraded the retailer's stock to \"overweight\" from \"neutral\", based on factors such as the success of the company's streetwear-inspired fashions as well as cost cuts.\n\nSalesforce.com\u2013 Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to \"buy\" from \"hold\", saying it was now more comfortable with the company's handling of various ongoing issues. It also said valuation is reasonable following a 20 percent drop from the stock's highs.\n\nApple\u2013The iPhone maker won a nearly $120 million award from Samsung in the month-long patent trial in California. However, that jury award was much less than Apple had sought.\n\nJPMorgan Chase\u2013The mega bank said its exposure to Russia amounted to $4.7 billion as of March 31, and that it is closely monitoring the events related to Ukraine and the impact of sanctions by the U.S. and other countries.\n\nMicrosoft\u2013The software giant's biggest shareholder is now former CEO Steve Ballmer, rather than founder Bill Gates. An SEC filing shows that Gates sold 4.6 million Microsoft shares last week, dropping him to second behind Ballmer. Gates has been selling Microsoft shares regularly to fund his charitable foundation.\n\nSotheby's\u2014Sotheby's has successfully held off an effort by Third Point's Daniel Loeb to remove the auction house's shareholder rights plan. A judge ruled Friday that he would not throw out Sotheby's \"poison pill\", which limits the amount activist investors can buy to 10 percent.\n\nGeneral Motors\u2014GM is recalling nearly 52,000 SUV models because of a possibly inaccurate fuel gauge.\n\nElectronic Arts\u2013The game maker is reportedly close to an agreement with Comcast to stream games through Comcast's advanced X1 cable delivery system, according to Reuters.\n\nOracle\u2013 Bernstein upgraded Oracle to \"outperform\" from \"neutral.\"\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\u2013Raymond James upgraded the restaurant chain's stock to \"outperform\" from \"market perform.\""

Of note, SPY did close above its 200 DMA, whereas QQQ remains below its 200 DMA.\n\nThe fact today's move occurred on comparatively high volume (144M & 75M respectively) suggests institution's participated, as opposed to only retail investors.\n\nCritical for the bulls will be a SPY close above at least 407.68 and a QQQ close above at least 293.47.

     ">Comcast\u2013The parent of NBCUniversal and CNBC earned 68 cents per share for the first quarter, excluding certain items, four cents above estimates, with revenue beating consensus as well. Comcast was helped by a surge in ad revenue at NBC, thanks to the Winter Olympics and Jimmy Fallon taking over as host of \"The Tonight Show.\"\n\n\n>Allergan\u2013The maker of Botox and eye care products is now a takeover target of Pershing Square's Bill Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Valeant is offering $48.30 per share in cash, plus 0.83 Valeant shares, for each share of Allergan. The latter's shareholders would own 43 percent of the combined company.\n\n\n>Travelers\u2013The insurer earned $2.95 per share for the first quarter, beating estimates of $2.16. Revenue was essentially in line, and the company also announced a 10 percent dividend increase.\n\n\n>United Technologies\u2013The aerospace manufacturer reported first quarter profit of $1.32 per share, excluding certain items, beating estimates by five cents. The company's results were aided by sales increases in all five of its operating units.\n\n\n>Lexmark\u2013The maker of computer printers beat estimates by five cents with first quarter profit of 92 cents per share, excluding certain items, with revenues also above consensus. Lexmark's results were boosted by increases in revenue for software and printing services.\n\n\n>Harley-Davidson\u2013The motorcycle maker earned $1.21 per share for the first quarter, 13 cents above estimates, with revenue scoring a strong beat as well. The company is maintaining its prior full-year forecast of up to 284,000 motorcycles sold for 2014.\n\n\n>Xerox\u2013The company beat estimates by three cents with first quarter profit of 27 cents per share, excluding certain items, but gave a current quarter forecast below consensus. Xerox is being impacted by declining sales in printing, as well as slower growth in services.\n\n\n>Netflix\u2013The steaming video service reported first quarter profit of 86 cents per share, three cents above estimates. The company also announced it would increase its monthly membership fee by $1 to $2 per month for new subscribers later this quarter, and projected current quarter profit above street estimates.\n"

     "good morning traders! happy groundhog day! here are your early movers on this tuesday-\n\n> **Pfizer** \u2014 The drug maker earned an adjusted 53 cents per share for the fourth quarter, 1 cent above estimates, with revenue also beating forecasts. Pfizer was helped by demand for its pneumonia vaccine and its recent acquisition of Hospira. However, Pfizer did forecast full-year 2016 earnings that are slightly below Street forecasts.\n\n> **Michael Kors** \u2014 The luxury goods maker beat estimates by 13 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.59 per share, and revenue also came in above forecasts. Kors was helped by particular strength in accessories and footwear.\n\n> **Archer Daniels Midland** \u2014 The grain processor missed estimates by 3 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 61 cents per share, and revenue was well short of forecasts. The company cited adverse market conditions that impacted many of its businesses, and said headwinds were likely to persist. However, ADM did raise its quarterly dividend to 30 cents per share from 28 cents.\n\n> **Dow Chemical** \u2014 The chemical maker, which is in the midst of merging with DuPont, earned an adjusted 93 cents per share for the fourth quarter, 23 cents above estimates, and revenue also was above forecasts.\n\n> **Sirius XM** \u2014 The satellite radio operator matched estimates with earnings of 3 cents per share for its latest quarter, and revenue was slightly above forecasts. However, Sirius did predict a slowing in subscriber growth this year to its slowest since at least 2013.\n\n> **Alphabet** \u2014 The Google parent reported adjusted quarterly profit of $8.67 per share, 57 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating forecasts. The core Google internet business saw operating income rise 23 percent for the year compared to 2014, and an after-hours rally propelled Alphabet past Apple as the world's most valuable company.\n\n> **Mattel** \u2014 The toy maker beat estimates by 6 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 67 cents per share, and revenue also came in above analyst forecasts. Mattel's bottom line was helped by its first quarterly sales increase in more than two years, helped by renewed popularity for Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys.\n\n> **Fitbit** \u2014 Oppenheimer initiated coverage on the wearable fitness products maker with an \"outperform\" rating, noting Fitbit's prominent position in a market Oppenheimer feels will grow rapidly in the future.\n\n> **Twitter** \u2014 Twitter was downgraded to \"sell\" from \"hold\" at Stifel, which said Twitter has never developed a sustainable business model and may never achieve that goal.\n\n> **Mallinckrodt** \u2014 The biopharmaceutical company reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.09 per share, well above estimates of $1.78. Revenue also beat forecasts, and the company raised its fiscal 2016 earnings guidance above current Street consensus. Mallinckrodt's upbeat performance was led by a 45 percent sales increase for its \"Exceptional Specialty Brands\" segment.\n\n> **Aflac** \u2014 Aflac reported adjusted quarterly profit of $1.56 per share, 9 cents above estimates, while revenue came in ahead of estimates as well. The insurance company was able to beat forecasts despite the negative impact of a weaker yen, which hurt Aflac's prominent Japan business.\n\n> **Anadarko Petroleum** \u2014 The energy producer lost an adjusted 57 cents per share, smaller than the consensus estimate of a $1.08 loss. Revenue was very slightly below forecasts as the company dealt with lower oil prices, and it said it expected to cut 2016 capital spending nearly in half compared to 2015.\n\n> **Rent-A-Center** \u2014 The company beat estimates by 2 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 54 cents per share, though revenue missed the mark. The rent-to-own company also predicted a 2016 same-store sales decline of one to 3 percent.\n\n> **BP** \u2014 BP reported its biggest annual loss in more than 20 years for 2015, and plans to cut 7,000 jobs by 2017. That represents about 9 percent of its workforce, as it tries to deal with the ongoing decline in oil prices.\n\n> **Sanofi** \u2014 Sanofi launched an effort to develop a vaccine to combat the fast-growing Zika virus. The project will be undertaken by the drug maker's Sanofi Pasteur vaccines division.\n\n> **UBS** \u2014 The bank reported earnings that topped analyst forecasts, but the shares are under pressure after the bank reported an unexpected outflow from its wealth management business.\n\n> **Take-Two Interactive** \u2014 The video game maker was hit with a copyright lawsuit by tattoo designer Solid Oak Sketches. The dispute involves the use of tattoos that are worn by NBA stars LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in Take-Two's NBA 2K16 video game.\n\n> **21st Century Fox** \u2014 Fox is aiming for $250 million in cost cuts over the next fiscal year, according to the Wall Street Journal. The paper said the cuts would come primarily through buyouts, with workers in the TV and movie studio groups notified on Monday."

As a result, the SPY is considerably closer to major resistance than the QQQ (e.g. $8 on the QQQ vs. only $2 on the SPY).  Of note, SPY did close above its 200 DMA, whereas QQQ remains below its 200 DMA.\n\nThe fact today's move occurred on comparatively high volume (144M & 75M respectively) suggests institution's participated, as opposed to only retail investors.\n\nCritical for the bulls will be a SPY close above at least 407.68 and a QQQ close above at least 293.47.  Regardless, with so many resistance levels above current price, upside will stil likely be limited in both price and duration."

It's closer to blue chips like Coke and Pepsi (25), McDonalds (26), Mastercard (28). This is despite Tesla having the best earnings growth prospects in the S&P 500 (expected to grow \\\\~36% in 2023) due to increading demand for EVs and energy storage products and generous incentives for battery manufacturing in the US, as well as Tesla's car software sales.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen looking at the price to earnings growth ratio (P/E divided by projected earnings growth rate), Tesla has one of the lowest ratios in the S&P 500.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[\\\\[Source\\\\]\\\\(https:\\\\/\\\\/finviz.com\\\\/map.ashx?st=peg\\\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jqott03sjq1a1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp\"",

     "Every stock is a good choice and every stock is a bad choice.\n\nWhat makes the difference between good and bad is you. You need to spend time researching anything and everything you actually purchase.\n\nMany brokers give demo accounts and I strongly recommend using it to actually test and see what works well without risking real money.\n\nThe one thing that I will say that will help you as you develop your trading and begin to really want to explore a live market more thoroughly is look for stocks that provide dividends. You want to be able to focus on when those dividends are paid. Win a stock pays a dividend may or may not be relevant to you based upon what you're trying to achieve with your own trading and investing.\n\nTypically speaking, stocks that pay quarterly will pay more each quarter than the stock that pays once a month but that is relative to the time frame of the actual payment. Also each stock pays a different rate compared to another so finding the right ones with the right risk appropriate your situation requires specific levels of research and time to make sure you are thrilled about your research.\n\nAs far as the amount you purchase, there are really two simple rules that apply to that,\n\n1. Never risk more than you can afford to lose,\n2. Always be willing to lose everything you risk."

You need $ to make $, so I would not start with stocks, invest in yourself first."

     "good tuesday morning traders of the subreddit stock market! here are your notable earnings reports out this morning-\n\n> **DuPont**\u2014The chemical maker earned an adjusted 54 cents per share for the third quarter, beating estimates by a penny, but revenue was slightly short of consensus. DuPont said its profit margins improved in five of seven businesses, but it also noted it expects sluggish fourth quarter growth in the global economy, and further currency headwinds that will affect its agriculture business.\n\n> **Pfizer**\u2014The pharmaceutical company beat estimates by 2 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 57 cents per share, with revenue also above forecasts. Pfizer also narrowed its earnings forecast for the full year, as it evaluates the impact of increased generic competition and its efforts to develop new treatments.\n\n> **Aetna**\u2014The insurance company reported third quarter profit of $1.67 per share, above estimates of $1.58, with revenue exceeding estimates as well. Aetna also raised its 2014 earnings forecast, amid further gains in its government-related business.\n\n> **Coach**\u2014The luxury goods maker beat Street forecasts by 8 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 53 cents per share, and revenue was also above forecasts. Coach's results were helped by growth in international sales.\n\n> **Whirlpool**\u2014The appliance maker missed estimates by 9 cents with an adjusted third quarter profit of $3.04 per share, though revenue was essentially in line. Whirlpool maintained that its underlying fundamentals are strong, and that it will unveil details of its strategy to increase shareholder value in December.\n\n> **AutoNation**\u2014The auto retailer reported adjusted third quarter profit of 90 cents per share, 4 cents above estimates, and sales also beat analyst forecasts. The bottom line beat came amid expanding profits on used car sales.\n\n> **Spirit Airlines**\u2014The airline earned an adjusted $1.01 per share for the third quarter, 3 cents above estimates, although revenue was short of forecasts. The company said improved operational performance and lower fuel costs helped it offset increases in other expenses.\n\n> **LabCorp**\u2014The medical lab operator earned an adjusted $1.80 per share for the third quarter, 5 cents above estimates, with revenue above analyst projections. The company also raised its full-year forecast, as it sees an increase in the number of customer visits to its labs.\n\n> **Cummins**\u2014The truck engine maker reported third quarter profit of $2.32 per share, 4 cents above estimates, with revenue also beating analyst forecasts. Stronger demand in North America, Europe, and China helped offset weakness in the Brazilian market.\n\n> **Sanofi**\u2014The French drug maker warned that price competition will hurt its diabetes treatment business in 2015, though the drug maker is sticking to its 2014 forecast.\n\n> **T-Mobile US**\u2014The wireless services provider lost 12 cents per share for its latest quarter, compared to analyst forecasts of a 1 cent per share profit. T-Mobile did post record subscriber growth for the quarter.\n\n> **Eli Lilly**\u2014The drug maker and Japanese partner Takeda saw a judge slash a $9 billion damage award to $36.8 million. The case involved their diabetes drug Actos. Users claimed the companies did not warn them that the treatment could raise the risk of bladder cancer.\n\n> **Tesla**\u2014CEO Elon Musk took to social media late Monday, after talk that Tesla's sales were slowing down helped push the stock down five percent on Monday. Musk said an article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting a slump in sales is incorrect.\n\n> **Madison Square Garden**\u2014The owner of the NBA's Knicks and NHL's Rangers is exploring a split off of its entertainment businesses from its sports and media properties.\n\n> **Novartis**\u2014The drug maker reported quarterly results that topped expectations, thanks to strong sales of its new products.\n\n> **Wal-Mart**\u2014The retailer will sell Activision Blizzard's newest installment of \"Call of Duty\" in its stores 24 hours before the new video game's official release.\n\n> **Twitter**\u2014The social network matched forecasts with adjusted quarterly profit of 1 cent per share. Revenue beat estimates, but investors are more focused on disappointing user metrics. Active users did rise by 23 percent, but timeline views per user dropped 7 percent.\n\n> **Amgen**\u2014Amgen reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.30 per share, 19 cents above estimates, with the biotech giant's revenue beating forecasts as well. Amgen's results were boosted by higher sales of its newer drugs, and it raised its full-year forecast in the wake of those results.\n\n> **Buffalo Wild Wings**\u2014The company beat estimates by 7 cents with quarterly profit of $1.14 per share, with the restaurant chain chalking up improved same-store sales as well as adding new locations.\n\n> **Crocs**\u2014Crocs earned 30 cents per share on an adjusted basis for its latest quarter, compared to estimates of 14 cents, and revenue was above Street forecasts as well. However, the shoe retailer also projected current quarter revenue below analyst estimates,\n\n> **Regal Entertainment**\u2014Regal is exploring various strategic options, including a possible sale, and has hired Morgan Stanley to assist. The movie theater chain also reported quarterly profit of 18 cents per share, one cent above estimates, but revenue was well short of forecasts.\n\n> **Kohl's**\u2014Kohl's said its 2014 earnings will be near the low end of its prior forecasts, as sales weakens. The retail chain sees third quarter same-store sales down 1.4 percent, continuing a trend that's been evident during the past few quarters.\n\n> **AutoZone**\u2014AutoZone has been subpoenaed in California over its handling of hazardous waste. The auto parts retailer said it is cooperating fully with authorities on the matter.\n"

Most of the population is vaccinated, so there may not be as many hospitalizations. The country uses the same vaccines that are available in the U.S.\\n\\nPotential Factor: On Sunday, the CEO of Pfizer said on ABC News that normal life will return in a year.

The Dow Jones (DIA) closed higher after its worst day since October 2020, as the price of oil, which suffered its worst day all year, somewhat rebounded. While it is way too early to make any conclusions, I am personally looking at this dip as a potential buying opportunity in equities that were overstretched before.\\n\\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients, Ultimately this is not the first or last variant scare and our tech playbook over the last 18 months has been to use these macro/risk-off events as buying opportunities to own the tech sector specifically cloud, cyber-security, and 5G winners.

An apparent dispute between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve also weighed on the minds of market participants.\\n\\nIn Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said during a press conference that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-KY) agreed to pick back up stimulus negotiations. However, given the tenuous political situation surrounding the presidential election and the gridlock that exists in the Senate (majority for the Senate is still undecided), it is highly unlikely that any form of stimulus is passed. For months, Congress and the White House went back and forth regarding stimulus but were unable to come to an agreement. In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that '",

Moderna and Pfizer have already submitted their vaccines to European and American health administrations for emergency use authorization. According to CBS News, during a conference call, Vice President Mike Pence told state governors that distribution of a vaccine could begin as early as mid-December. According to audio obtained by CBS News, Vice Presiden Pence said, We strongly be'",

None of these things are several months off and will occur this month. Sure it's not to the general public, but it is the light at the end of the tunnel that people havent seen before. They will still have a great impact against the virus, especially with healthcare workers getting it first. If you actually invest, then the short-term bearish attitude is meaningless."

     "After reading more comments, it's been a long year for some, short year for others, one not likely forgotten. Still, what normally happens in Dec is that there are a lot of financial planners who suggest to clients to sell looser's, take those losses (tax harvesting), lock in gains, etc. So, much of that happens before the holidays when the advisors go onto their holiday. So now is when, short of exceptional NEW news, normal selling occurs. And selling begets more selling, hence a softer market, which creates a cascading effect. If you must buy, buy the best quality.\n\nThe investing strategies everyone is mentioning is personal situations, kind of different than it seems the original intent of the OP. I for one, who for the last 30 years have had piling up of capital gains losses, am able to wipe them out with trades in 2020. So swing trading has been my savior, hundreds of thousand of $$$ with no taxes due. There are likely many traders like me. So even now, I'll dump the looser's to clear the decks for the next winners."
