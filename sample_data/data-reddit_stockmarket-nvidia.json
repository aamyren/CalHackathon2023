By your logic, I can just say that the GDP of Somalia (7,293 billion) is higher than that of more than 5 countries combined (Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Palau, Marshall Islands). While this argument is true, it fails to take into consideration the difference in size of these countries and purposefully neglects other countries who have a similar GDP to Somalia, thus presenting a distorted image that overinflates the image of Somalia."

     "Here is the paper.   \n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433\n\nIt is worth a read.  Basically they found that switching using 100% optical uses a ton less power.  So instead of converting, switching, and converting back.   Google instead keep it optical and have mirrors that are physically moved to change connections.\n\nIt does need to be longer life connections as it takes almost a second to realign each time to switch the connection paths.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal.   Ultimately there is a cost to run large language models like Bard and ChatGPT, etc.     The cost is over 100x of using a traditional search engine that at the core uses Backrub/Page Rank.   \n\nThis paper is really dated but so much more true today than ever before.  Google was really smart to start preparing for today 8 years ago with the development of the TPUs.  I think this is a place Microsoft has really made a mistake in not doing the same and dependent on Nvidia.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/\n\nI do love that Google shares this stuff.  I am retired now and a lot of free time but get a real charge out of learning.  But I think from an investment standpoint Google really should not be so generous.   But I guess they find it is worth it because it helps them attract the best talent.    Top talent want to share things.  I think this is a big reason Apple does so poorly when it comes to AI."

Now what it got is: currency mining market dipping, and even selling out their former, still current-gen cards. Ai market shrinking as well, with competition coming even from unexpected players such as Google and Aws. Gaming is taking advantage of stocks being sold from mining operations, or waiting for prices to get lower, or for the next gen, or trying out Amd for better value.

When they start seeing a company do good and their models think it should be worth higher, they buy it up and goes on massive elongated runs since institutions need a long time to complete their buy if their buying billions worth. The stock sky rockets and then once they see something is wrong, they take their massive profits and head on home. The stock plummets and goes nowhere, or goes to zero. Institutions don\u2019t believe it in anymore and likely they already see new stocks that deserve to be bought instead. So they\u2019ll be moving on. This is called a broken leader, don\u2019t be an idiot and think your somehow strategically buying a dip of something Wall Street shat in the bin. Your supposed to be buying what Wall Streets buying. I\u2019ll do you guys a big favour and point you all in the right direction. Look up stock stage analysis and buying broken leaders. You\u2019d see this is exactly what Nvidia is now. Why risk it?

They know how to read financial statements and ask questions that allow them to fill in cell B13 on their Excel models - but often the questions they ask suggest they're focusing in the \"wrong\" area, while the answers they're given are so lacking in specificity that even if the question was spot-on, it doesn't inform an insightful answer.  \n\nDo your own research.  And if you're not willing to go deep on any one company, go broad on many - index funds or mutual funds to spread risk.   And if you do invest in singular companies/stocks just be prepared for the inevitable highs and lows that follow as you try to outsmart the market.  \n\nCramer was also hot on Theranos and we all know how that ended.

The news/media makes it sound like bull market and increasing stock prices is good, and decreasing prices and bear markets are bad, and it\u2019s really annoying  Whether a market is good/bad depends on the individual investor\u2019s positioning.  In a bear market, when prices are declining then having a negative delta position is statistically favorable, so that\u2019s why I have that position, so to go in the opposite direction is what\u2019s bad.\n\nI was praying for Jerome Powell to come out and announce an emergency 1,000 bps hike in the fed funds rate.

It's just they used the hype of ChatGPT and OpenAI and just cashed in on the AI buzzword on Q report hype for extra stock riling.\n\nBiggest irony is, NVIDIA actually made major advancements in AI themselves well prior to this with their DLSS, which actually should have given them more stock than it initially did, but people were hung up on AMD aggressive pricing and the fact they were on 5nm chipsets and in years of dominance finally someone was catching up to NVIDIA.\n\nPeople are now acting like this is gonna be an revolution, when in reality the hype is gonna die down in 3 months, especially since this is not some co-research AI deal, they are simply selling the product at a good rate to a hyped industry and regardless of all this  NVIDIA will continue growing with a steady trend because it's a good company with strong position overall in a market that will continue needing steady supply of GPUs with growing rates, but acting like this is some AI rocketship that changes the game is ridiculous"

However, the underlying hardware will eventually reach a bottleneck that everyone in the industry has already started preparing for. Heterogenous computing is an inevitability, and since I see AMD adapting to those right now, I would weight my bets towards AMD. But no doubt in the near term, both are great stocks."

Nvidia is building the entire stack with APIS, software and GPU, so it's the complete pack. If you check the history of Nvidia, they always took bold bets even when the market was going against them. If you check the Cuda product, in 2008, they were still putting in money when the market was soft, so I admire that about them.\n\nAMD is betting on the zen architecture, that's firing on all cylinders now and it's targeting literally everything with pc, embedded, data centres and many more things. They don't care about the entire stack right now with software and API. They do have their APIS but not as good as Nvidia.\n\nSo if you take advanced projects, you will notice engineers only use Cuda and that only works with Nvidia's gpu so the ecosystem is amazing just like Apple.\n\ni have covered this in my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlw94i1TZ9Q&themeRefresh=1&ab\\_channel=Stockado"

First of all TA requires candles, because the wicks and bodies are just as important.\n\nThis is what you're looking at on the monthly: Also your \"monthly\" is just the last month. You're looking at daily price still.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hmesQLZl/)\n\nOn the daily this is called a tower.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SQFEYu57/)\n\nIt could signal reversal, but it could just be a pause and more upward.\n\nTech Analysis is more about target price and risk management than about predicting direction. How much risk does it have to do the opposite of what you think, and how much reward could be expected if it does what you think.\n\nBulkowski's patterns are very good for their target pricing. Most patterns are 50/50 on which direction they go, and they have 4 ways of getting there.\n\n1. Go your way\n2. Go against you.\n3. Go your way but then bust and reverse direction\n4. Go against you then bust and go your way.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Hkwl0zp5/)\n\nThis gap is a significant problem for bulls, gaps are usually filled. Traders know this. So they won't be buying. Only stooges buy something that gaps like this which is why the stock stalled. Retail is buying, traders are out, institutions likely aren't involved.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gn6fbnBY/)\n\nOn a 4 hour this is a triple bottom. I am short AAPL for similar reasons. NVDA was more irrational because of the gap so I played AAPL instead.\n\nNVDA will likely fail the triple bottom and fill the gap. That's the trade I'd play if I weren't already playing it in AAPL and I'm also short SPY.\n\nI'm also long TLT and GLD so there's a bit of \"counter trend\" in my portfolio already so no need to go for NVDA."

     "\"NVDA is overvalued, you should buy value stocks\" isn't a good argument. Mostly because cheap stocks in relations to assets and earnings are in businesses where returns on capital are low, and it requires selling them for new cheap stocks once they've appreciated. It can be done, but I'd much rather be part of a business with good economics that can be held for a longer period of time. \n\nFun fact - the S&P growth and value index have very similar revenue growth rates. Growth has outperformed for a decade because it has vastly higher returns on capital. They are better businesses because they require less investment to grow, even if the growth is slow."

     "I think you make a lot of good points however, I have to disagree with ruling Intel out. You seem to have a good understanding of these companies what they do, how they make money, etc. And it is totally correct that AMD and NVDA will likely continue to grow at a faster rate than Intel, but I think it is very important to also consider the price you are paying for a stock. At the end of the day a good company can still be priced too high to buy into with any real margin of safety and in my opinion that is the case with both AMD and NVDA. Personally I like discounted free cashflow to determine fair value and if analyst's estimates for revenues over the next 5-10 years are even remotely accurate (which they usually are) AMD and NVDA both look to be trading at much higher prices than what I calculate their intrinsic values to be. Intel is around or a bit below its fair value depending on what numbers you use, but of course there are reasons it is being valued much lower than the other two.\n\ntldr; IMHO (strictly my humble opinion and in NO WAY financial advice): AMD and NVDA are trading too far above intrinsic value to be good buys, and of course even if Intel's stock price looks attractive if you do not like their business prospects for the coming years it may not be a good buy either so I guess I didn't really help you at all lol"

I am not sure Intel even thought about it but having TSMC produce chips for their GPU reduces the amount of chips they can produce for Nvidia and AMD.\n\nAt the same time Intel can continue producing their own chips for other things (they don't rely on them in CPU as opposed to AMD).\n\nTSMC is a major bottleneck for both of these companies while not so much for Intel. What good is quality when you can't build it. Just look at the shortage that Nvidia experienced after they launched their 3070.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIntel is also opening a brand new market for themselves in the gaming GPU market with Alchemist rumored to be released Q1 (Laptop) and Q2 (Desktop) of 2022. On top of that Battlemage is rumored to remain with TSMC chips and to go down to 4/5nm chips.\n\nThis is of course on top of them moving into vehicle chips and offering to produce much smaller chips for cars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy money is definitely on Intel long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you might want to look into Analog Devices (ADI).

Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong.\\n\\nI've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term.\\n\\nIMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more.\\n\\nHere are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this):\\n\\n1. Nvidia\\n\\nI think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030.

We are going to see more and more companies go the route that Google has gone with the TPUs.   Heck Cruise is doing their own chips instead of using Nvidia.   Even Microsoft is now reported working on their own TPUs.  Little late but they will get there I suspect."

     "My only concern is that you do not really break down the main technological offerings of either Intel or AMD. This may be something that you assume we know and just leave it out for simplicity sake, but a technology company needs to be analyzed by its technology.\n\nInvestors made a similar mistake to the one listed above over the last five years in Intel. Investors rely solely on the financials and ignore the underlying technologies of the business. Some things that should be considered are:\n\n1. TSMC is generations ahead of Intel in manufacturing processes\n2. Intel's main direct competitors use TSMC\n3. Intel and AMD utilize x86 chip architecture which is at a disadvantage in lower power devices such as laptops when compared to x64 ARM chips\n4. Intel's offerings are technologically inferior to AMD and Nvidia's offerings in datacenters\n5. IDM 2.0 is a massive financial risk for Intel and is utilizing billions in capital investment a year\n\nI think there is much more qualitative research that would need to be conducted to definitively make a conclusion on these businesses"

     "Hey Man, good stuff. I\u2019m curious, how did you pick these stocks? Did you do fundamental analysis on them? Or is it hearsay from friends/family/social media. \n\nIf you did fundamental analysis and believe these stocks are good to hold for long term, then by all means. Just a bit concentrated on Tech, as already mentioned in here. \n\nIt would be not wise to give any advice on specific stuff without more background. Suitability is a crucial part of fin services so take internet advice with a grain of salt. I\u2019d first suggest you do a risk assessment prior to investing. Buying stocks without knowing your objectives and risk profile is like taking medications without a diagnosis, just unsuitable. Here\u2019s a link for that. [Schwab assessment](https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-778947/)\n\nFrom there, you get some suggestions on typical asset allocations based on your risk profile. Then you diversify away as you go. ETFs are a great diversification tool, ETNs or Bond funds for Fixed Income exposure if you need it, etc. Soros has a famous quote: \"If investing is entertaining, if you\u2019re having fun, you\u2019re probably not making any money. Good investing is boring.\"\n\nSet up some good funds, with good returns and decent expense ratios, practice dollar cost averaging on them, and let compound interest do its magic. \n\nIn the meantime, read Benjamin Graham\u2019s Intelligent Investor and if you like valuation, read Security Analysis. Best of luck young man, and tread carefully."

     "I sold numerous times over the last several years. I stopped messing with it once it got over $300. Though I regret it, I still think the stock is an inflated bubble.\n\nI have no clue how some people get some of these projections. NVDA needs serious growth to reach the value that people are anticipating, which it is doing. Though, I don't know how long it can continue it's projected growth. By investing in NVDA, you are investing in the fact that they stay at the forefront of developing chips for gaming, AI, cloud computing, and crypto mining - and that such markets continue to grow significantly.\n\nNVDAs dividends are at a minor 0.10% yield right now. All investors are investing in is the hope of selling it at a higher price in the future, or one day they start paying serious dividends. Paying a decent dividend would require their earnings to significantly grow. The P/E ratio is insane. For significant growth, the P/E ratio either needs to continue climbing to insane heights from all the optimism, or the company somehow expand their market presence, which is hard considering they are at the forefront of it.\n\nI love NVDA, it was my first investment, bought at $53 per share. I've missed out on some serious financial gain because I've sold it a few years back. It has been one of the fastest growing stocks for a while now. Though, that growth seems to be mostly in it's P/E ratio. Whether you hold/buy/sell is up to you, just know that there is a lot of optimism riding it's current price.\n\nCurrently, there are better soltions to crypto currency mining than GPUs, but the price for the alternative solutions are much higher. If competition prices were to drop, NVDA could face some losses. GPU prices have also significantly increased, and many are on back order. I'm curious if GPU prices will drop soon, and if new chip manufacturers will rise up to compete with NVDA because of all the silicone chip growth."

That impulse feeling you get, either way is seldom right and you will benefit from learning to control it. \n\nIn regards to the losses I\u2019m unsure if you can harvest a loss in germany tax wise?

Otherwise strap in and enjoy the ride. \n\nI personally like to try to find disrupters to industries with really reliable customers (crsp to chronic illness treatment, run&fcel to energy production) as well as under appreciated  markets (crwd and panw to cyber security, Amat and Lcrx to chips produced in America). I think these have massive long term potential. My time horizon is greater than 20years and I think these companies/sectors will outperform considerably, so this is my get rich fund.\n\nSeparately, in my tax advantages accounts like my Roth and my 401k, I tolerate a lot less risk so those are mostly S&P500ETFs and some international large cap ETFs. Generally still bullish with a long time horizon so I\u2019m not too worried about hedging with bonds or anything like that. That\u2019s a bridge I\u2019ll cross when I\u2019m within five years of my desired retirement. At that point I\u2019ll be concerned of the downside, and diversify into bonds, reets, dividends, etc. This is the money I expect to pay the bills when I\u2019m old.

     "I think your stock choices are not all that bad honestly, if your intention is to hold them forever, however I do agree with others that this isn\u2019t the best way to go about investing as a young person new to all this. In fact, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best way for almost anyone to go about investing. \n\nThe simple thing to do which is highly highly effective is to invest in the broad market with low cost etfs or mutual funds unless or until you feel like you are an expert investor. The broad market represents the aggregate estimated long term value of all stocks by expert investors. Ask yourself what you know about McDonalds that expert investors and the market as a whole doesn\u2019t know or what information or insight you have which the market also has but refuses to act on? \n\nIf you don\u2019t have a very good answer to that, you should not be investing in individual stocks at all. If you want to become an expert, there are a lot of books you can read about investing generally. You can research factor investing and value investing etc. But until you have done enough research to consider yourself an expert that can confidently discuss your investing philosophy, stay in broad market funds. Something like the SP500, the total US Stock Market, or the total world stock market."

As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, lets use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the companys average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\\n\\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the companys shares.\\n\\nSo we have nvidias equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billio'",

     "If you are building a solid diversified portfolio in equities only, you should own some income stocks as well. Their dividends give you exposure to payments similar to holding a bond that pays a coupon payment on certain dates until maturity. An income stock does not have the direct current market value if you need to sell in reverse (negative correlation) to interest rate movements/levels.\n\nThe 60/40  equity/bond build is back in favor since the QE mania from The Fed has ended which only goosed up the equity returns over the past 13 years. A 2-year treasury bond gives you a 4.8% yield right now until maturity, with zero risk.\n\nThe Rule of thumb is the older you get, and having less working/income earnings years left until retirement, the heavier you weigh on the bond side. Bonds have much less risk, especially Treasuries.\n\nOne portfolio I built had tech (MSFT - small dividend), banks (JP morgan - smal dividend), retail (DLTR - retail), defense (LMT - small dividend), energy (XOM - 8% dividend) and consumer products (MO - 8% dividend) in the mix. Built that one in the fall of 2020 and has worked quite well. (those 8%s were at time of buying. XOMs is lower now).\n\nWell diversified. Your portfolio gets an income payment every quarter from dividends with which you can use to reinvest and buy a few more shares of the stock. Some stocks went up, some went down. Overall, the SP500 is down, and that portfolio is up.\n\nHere is one of the better links I found on sector rotation.\n\n[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market\\_analysis:sector\\_rotation\\_analysis](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:sector_rotation_analysis)\n\nNotice the 6 stocks I put in that portfolio fall in different sectors on the rotation map, which further diversifies your portfolio and also against market fluctuations. To size balance to start, you can use $s into each stock and not the nominal stock prices.\n\nThat portfolio got a little lucky as I picked DLTR in the fall of 2020 after the March covid blip down and then popped back up as I expected coming inflation with The Fed buying over $4T in bonds. Then, after Joe won, I figured DC spending was going to ramp up. It did not hurt that the war propped up LMT and energy prices as well.\n\nBest of luck.\n\ngoing forward long term, I really like cyber security stocks."

Some of the stocks in SCHD include Costco, Pepsi, Merck, Amgen, Cisco, Blackrock.

NVDA did a stock split when their base 1 share price got around 850ish 7 for 1 split. NVDA has outperformed GOOGL on a harder rally YTD, in part due to second leg up shortly after a share split. Its no secret the modern stock market is going through records options activity as well as record amounts of retail buying in. More liquid stock as well as cheaper stock price via split can alleviate the cost of writing 1 options contract since options are inherently a contract regarding 100 shares of the underlying security. I honestly think the split has helped NVDA rally since retail investors who liked NVDA now had access to cheaper option contracts through stock corporate action.

     "So easy to mitigate something like this:\n\n* You and your spouse cannot purchase individual stocks or options while you are serving in Congress. Only index funds.\n* Term limits. There shouldn't be a reason for career politicians. If you can do the job, you don't need 30+ years to prove so.\n* After your term limit, you are prevented from owning individual stocks for a one-year period.\n\nThese three simple things would prevent the majority of abuse. You won't prevent them all as Nancy can easily gossip to her wealthier friends but something like that would be impossible to forcibly prevent. If you're a politician who is 'serving the public', investing in stocks shouldn't be a priority for you as it has been for Nancy."

That being said, you should fill your positions gradually. The price is 50% off from ATH, you can purchase 5%, and if it drops lower, then purchase another 5%"

Like you, I believe in the company and think their fundamentals are strong now and for the future. This is why I bought the stock in the first place.

     "Yeah.  Warren Buffett\u2019s point is that is is next to impossible for the average investor, or even sophisticated investors, to outperform the market over a long period of time so best idea is to just buy the market hence his suggested S&P 500 (or one of the many ETFs that mirrors it).  You can go broader or pick up international via similar ETFs that each have their theoretical pluses and minuses but basically the same theory.  That 25% of the index is in 5 names is troublesome but that is unlikely to last for all sorts of reasons.    \n\n\nIf you were good enough to buy the winners (before they were winners) and sell the losers (before they became losers) you\u2019d obviously beat the market.  There are various strategies that, if implemented religiously, historically have beaten the market but once enough folks find out about them, the excess returns are arbitraged away as others pile into the strategy.

Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think.\\n\\n20% S&P index fund,\\nXLK - 5%,\\nXLI - 5%,\\nXLP - 20.25%,\\nXLU - 10%,\\nXLB - 2.5%,\\nXLV - 18%,\\nXLC - 5%,\\nXLE - 5.5%,\\n5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM.\\n\\nEssentially were leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.\\n\\nRemaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.'",

BTW, if you've been in the market for a LOOONG time, look at your stocks objectively, in a big pullback some stocks will be worth ADDING to, vs losing money on as the multiple gets chopped in half sorta thing. For example.. I bought some Chevron and Exon when they were in the toilet with negative oil price... fundamentally were these companies going bankrupt with everybody still driving? No.. now they are 2.5x that buy in price."

The market as a whole right now is quite expensive vs historical prices as well.  My put is if you really like a company, buy it ONLY if you could keep holding even if the market turned south, and even keep adding money to it to average down.  Think wanting to hold for 5+ years minimum.  If you can't or don't think you can do that, buy some S&P500 which will be less volatile, or a blend of domestic and international stocks with bonds which will be further less volatile."

Not to mention that their biggest cash cow, Facebook, is getting worse and worse as Zuck has lost interest in it. If Zuck announced he's cutting metaverse spending by 75%, and is laying off 20% of the company (as as been suggested by institutional investors), the stock would double in a few weeks.

You need to spend time researching anything and everything you actually purchase.\n\nMany brokers give demo accounts and I strongly recommend using it to actually test and see what works well without risking real money.\n\nThe one thing that I will say that will help you as you develop your trading and begin to really want to explore a live market more thoroughly is look for stocks that provide dividends. You want to be able to focus on when those dividends are paid. Win a stock pays a dividend may or may not be relevant to you based upon what you're trying to achieve with your own trading and investing.\n\nTypically speaking, stocks that pay quarterly will pay more each quarter than the stock that pays once a month but that is relative to the time frame of the actual payment. Also each stock pays a different rate compared to another so finding the right ones with the right risk appropriate your situation requires specific levels of research and time to make sure you are thrilled about your research.\n\nAs far as the amount you purchase, there are really two simple rules that apply to that,\n\n1. Never risk more than you can afford to lose,\n2. Always be willing to lose everything you risk."

You are right, don't believe the analyst.  I think at the beginning of the year they (analysts as a whole) were projecting over a 50% return for the market this year and it has a 20%, or so, loss.\n\nThe best time to get into the market is after a big down year, so your Meta, Amazon, Goog, and Apple could very well return 30 to 70%, maybe more this next year.  Buy equal amounts of all four and you most likely will be up this time next year.  CRM, VFC and SWK are also decent bets for next year.\n\nAnother important rule is don't invest money in the stock market that you need in less than 5 to 7 years.  So trying to make enough in a short time to purchase a plane ticket is most likely not going to work, more times than not.  Sorry, but the stock market is a slow growth machine.  The most powerful sklow growth machine over time, but slow nonetheless.  Best of luck."

In order for nVidia (or amd for that matter) to grow sa it did through 2017 / 2018, there will need to be another catalyst such as crypto.\n\nThis being said, I think the next catalyst will be caused by advances in monitors and consoles. Many gamers and general PC users will need faster gpu's to support their builds; and with consoles breaking into Pc esque specs (as best they can; xbox one x for example), PC will continue to advance to outpace and drive memory prices.\n\ntl;dr - all about the memory, imo next gen consoles will be the next catalyst for the company"

You have some of the most worthwhile posts on stocks i see on Reddit. \n\nIt seems like choosing stocks that are going through a split could be functioning as a screen for companies with rapid growth. \n\nA couple questions:  why do low priced stocks do a split? There seem to be disadvantages in having share prices too low. ( if it dips afterwards it could end up off the nasdaq(etc) and traded OTC. )\nTo understand why they tend to do very well afterward, it would help to understand that. \n\nThere is a definite survivor bias here by screening for stocks presently over billion market cap- as someone else pointed out.  How many were eliminated by that? What happens to your data if you don\u2019t use that criterium?

     "I would just funnel money into a market cap weighted index fund at your age (VOO and VTI are good options). There is little reason for you to take on the long term risk of picking individual tech companies (the counter argument of course is that you are young and at a period where risk can payoff handsomely). The companies you chose may grow fast in the short term, but you will likely want to consider selling them at some point (50 years is an eternity in tech). Nvidia has been a mega grower, but they also dove hard during the recent crash which means you could get stuck holding them when they lose a large portion of their value if you aren't actively paying attention. An index fund wouldn't require much if any oversight over that time. If you invested just $200 a month until 65 years old then at a 7% return rate you'd have over $1 million. You'll likely be able to afford more than $200 a month as you get older and you'd likely hit higher than 7% returns, so consider that a low estimate. I personally recommend having at least 50% of your total investments in index funds - especially if you aren't 100% sure of what you're doing and can't spend time to research companies on your own."

It is also easier to invest in when you don't have enough funds to buy very much.\n\nYou buy one share of VOO and you own a slice of 500 of the largest companies divided by their total market value.\n\nThis removes your exposure to one company going under when you can't own many. It also gives you more time on what to look for to pick individual companies properly."

Too many investor hold on to winners and waste valuable time/return potential elsewhere. \n3) avoid short term cap gains at all costs \n4) keep a war chest handy for period of Vol. (such as 1Q20) while you can hold cash, you may be better off of a hedged product that still generates return above cash. Maybe look into the Innovator ETFs, Gateway or JPM\u2019s Hedged Equity Suite. \n5) Patience\u2026compounding is truly no joke."

     "Preface: I don't know your risk profile. However, here's a spectrum of options that may prove useful. You don't have the money to diversify with individual stocks. To be properly diversified, you need to buy something that is pre diversified like an ETF. If you want higher returns, your risk will go up significantly.\n\nSafe: Buy ETFs that follow indices like SPY. Let them sit for years. Buy ETFs that are value based like Vangaurd hold for years. If interest rates are low, buy a growth based ETF. Sell when interest rates increase. If you want more risk, buy an etf in a particular sector. When doing this, find a way to balance your portfolio across different promising sectors in case one underperforms.\n\nSlightly risky: Do the above with ITM options with at least three months to expiry. It's going to provide you essentially the same trade, but it'll do it with leverage. It'll multiply both your losses and gains. You can do the same with margin. Just be sure to use a stop loss to prevent losing your money. Also, learn how options work. If you don't understand options, you can lose your entire position.\n\nRisky: Invest in individual stocks. See typical advice for stocks. Normally, it would be slightly risky, but without diversification, there's more variance with them. I recommend a value approach considering the effect that tapering with have on growth stocks. You can try options, but the variance might kill you.\n\nVery Risky: Small stocks they provide even more opportunity for growth. These stocks and their options will provide you with potential moonshots, but it is nearly certain that you'll lose your entire position. I would place deep value and meme stocks here.\n\nDO NOT DO THIS: DON'T buy penny stocks, illiquid options, communist stocks, deep OTM options, or OTC stocks. If you do this, you are putting yourself at significant risk of loss. You deserve to lose your entire position if you do these.\n\nAfterstatement: People may disagree with my assessment, but this is my personal investment philosophy. It works for me. It may not work for you. This is not investment advice and is only to be used for educational purposes. Invest at your own risk after doing your own research."

Fractional shares .... literally ... are fabricated by your broker. \n\nThat\u2019s not good. IMO it\u2019s better to have fewer companies in the portfolio with whole shares than it is to have more companies with fractional shares.  So I never ever buy fractional shares.\n\nCompanies don\u2019t sell fractional shares, middlemen like Robinhood do.   When you buy fractional shares you are just borrowing shares from a middleman.  The middleman keeps your voting rights and you rely on that middleman to be honest that they have not sold fractional shares from a pool they don\u2019t own.\n\nHave you ever seen a company like Robinhood validate that ALL of the fractional shares they sell add up to whole shares?\n\nNo you haven\u2019t. Because they\u2019re not validating that very important fact.\n\nWith all of the complaints about \u201cfake synthetic shares\u201d on Reddit I\u2019m surprised nobody calls out fractional shares for what they really are: fake, made up faux fractional shares."

Not that you won't make a return but at this stage and with your holdings you might as well just buy the SP500 consistently. \n\nIf you want to take on more risk to return ratio you might as well just through a grand in GOOGL or TSLA \n\nOn the other hand if you are just starting and this is like your first $700 but you will be adding another $700 every 2 weeks or month or whatever the case. Then I mean. This isn't an aweful selection.  Not super risky,  good companies. But you are overlapping the SP500 quite a bit.  \n\nIf you wanted to not use the hood, I'd recommend Fidelity for an individual broker.  Or for your type of portfolio possibly even M1 finance. \n\nGood luck and remember to keep investing steadily and don't be afraid to be more aggressive during market crashes and pull-backs!"

Selling UVXY calls has been making consistent profit even in 2022!\n\nLike, you have to hate yourself and your family for still going long UVXY to this date. You are lighting your money on fire by going long leveraged volatility products.\n\nThe reason why UVXY keeps dumping is because European Hedge and Pension funds make their livinbg shorting UVXY's entire float. It's the only explanation for UVXY's downwards trend in 2022.\n\nYou can front run these European Hedge fund algorithms by shorting UVXY and UVIX shares, or selling UVXY calls as SPY is dropping. This is exactly how their algorithms work. You can see it playing out on the charts intraday.\n\nTLDR: UVXY bagholders are the reason why markets have already bottomed for 2022. Watch intraday to see the collapse of UVXY due to European Hedge funds algorithmically shorting the entire UVXY float.

Valuation is based on earnings and growth, not the number of cars produced. Except Tesla is growing at 50% YoY and companies like GM and Ford are not even close. That's why they're valued where they are."

I have been a financial analyst and I would never do DD because it is boring, low value and generally done after all the big thinking is done. \n\nThe process is usually identification, analysis, intention, DD, bid. DD is basically just aiding work making sure that the way the company represented itself is correct. \n\n\"Due diligence is an investigation, audit, or review performed to confirm facts or details of a matter under consideration. In the financial world, due diligence requires an examination of financial records before entering into a proposed transaction with another party.\"\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp)\n\nI've been involved in dozens of transactions and this is correct. Financial analysis, like you have done is a big high-level effort directed at influencing the opinions of key decisions makers. DD is just a bean counting exercise that makes sure everything is what is is claimed to be. \n\nI haven't read your entire piece but see it as financial analysis, like that done in ER, other advisory or within deal shops. It does not look like the DD that these firms subcontract, typically to far less prestigious and lucrative outfits.\n\nI have been head of equity research, ran advisory businesses and at time have done commercial and strategic due diligence.

When they announced the ARM deal, their stock price shot up. I read an analyst last week saying that he thinks the market is pricing the stock as if the ARM deal won't go through. There is a lot of bull eagerness to price it in twice. During the earnings call the executive was talking about the growth of GPUs in the data center, and blah blah blah. They're a great graphics chip company, but the ones going into the server room are integrated, mostly from AMD. Lots of companies have tried to adapt ARM chips for the server room. Nobody has had much success. Mostly because the it would have to be a cheaper option, with lower margins. Well, commodity margins to bring the data center CPU costs down isn't a big revenue center. But investors really loved what he said. It could go up for another 5 years and then crash, or it could pop next week.\n\nSYNA was a great buy... last month."
