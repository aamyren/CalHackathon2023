     "If you are building a solid diversified portfolio in equities only, you should own some income stocks as well. Their dividends give you exposure to payments similar to holding a bond that pays a coupon payment on certain dates until maturity. An income stock does not have the direct current market value if you need to sell in reverse (negative correlation) to interest rate movements/levels.\n\nThe 60/40  equity/bond build is back in favor since the QE mania from The Fed has ended which only goosed up the equity returns over the past 13 years. A 2-year treasury bond gives you a 4.8% yield right now until maturity, with zero risk.\n\nThe Rule of thumb is the older you get, and having less working/income earnings years left until retirement, the heavier you weigh on the bond side. Bonds have much less risk, especially Treasuries.\n\nOne portfolio I built had tech (MSFT - small dividend), banks (JP morgan - smal dividend), retail (DLTR - retail), defense (LMT - small dividend), energy (XOM - 8% dividend) and consumer products (MO - 8% dividend) in the mix. Built that one in the fall of 2020 and has worked quite well. (those 8%s were at time of buying. XOMs is lower now).\n\nWell diversified. Your portfolio gets an income payment every quarter from dividends with which you can use to reinvest and buy a few more shares of the stock. Some stocks went up, some went down. Overall, the SP500 is down, and that portfolio is up.\n\nHere is one of the better links I found on sector rotation.\n\n[https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market\\_analysis:sector\\_rotation\\_analysis](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:sector_rotation_analysis)\n\nNotice the 6 stocks I put in that portfolio fall in different sectors on the rotation map, which further diversifies your portfolio and also against market fluctuations. To size balance to start, you can use $s into each stock and not the nominal stock prices.\n\nThat portfolio got a little lucky as I picked DLTR in the fall of 2020 after the March covid blip down and then popped back up as I expected coming inflation with The Fed buying over $4T in bonds. Then, after Joe won, I figured DC spending was going to ramp up. It did not hurt that the war propped up LMT and energy prices as well.\n\nBest of luck.\n\ngoing forward long term, I really like cyber security stocks."

     "# The Dow is set to surge 5% to a record as Pfizer says Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective\n\n*****\n> Investors cheered on Monday after drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech said trial data indicated their Covid-19 vaccine is 90% effective.\n*****\n> Many on Wall Street applauded the announcement as a sign that the pharmaceutical industry may soon have a viable way to control a disease that has derailed the U.S. economy for much of 2020 and has killed more than 230,000 Americans.\n*****\n> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,537 points, or 5.4%, implying an opening gain of more than 1,500 points. The Dow\u2019s previous intraday record was 29,568.57, about 1,245 points from Friday\u2019s close.\n*****\n> S&P 500 futures jumped 4%. Russell 2000 futures rallied 7%, triggering upside limits set by the CME Group to prevent highly volatile trading moves.\n*****\n> Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.5% as traders left crowded growth and stay-at-home stocks in favor of cyclical companies that could outperform if the Pfizer vaccine is approved for widespread use.\n*****\n> Stocks were already set to continue their big post-election rally Monday as Democrat Joe Biden defeated incumbent Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential race to become president elect, according to NBC projections.\n*****\n> Dow futures were up about 400 points before the vaccine news.\n*****\n> The 90% effective rate from Pfizer and Germany\u2019s BioNTech was better than what the market was expecting. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said that a vaccine that was 50% to 60% effective would be acceptable.\n*****\n> \u201cAmazing news from Pfizer with 90% efficacy. This hopefully is the beginning of the end of our fight against Covid,\u201d Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote in an email.\n*****\n> \u201cAs I\u2019ve been saying on the hopes of this, we need to shift our attention to those parts of the market that have been the most hammered because of Covid and away from the work from home stocks that have had such an incredible year because Covid is not forever,\u201d he added.\n*****\n> Travel, restaurant and hospitality companies that saw their equities swoon in the spring as Covid surged saw some of the strongest rallies on Monday following Pfizer\u2019s announcement.\n*****\n> \u201cIt is materially bullish for stocks in the near term,\u201d said Tom Essaye of The Sevens Report. \u201cRegarding the data, the 90% efficiency rate in preventing COVID-19 is higher than was hoped for...Given election clarity and the calendar (holiday\u2019s approaching), a run in the S&P 500 to 3900 is not unreasonable. \u201d\n*****\n> Shares of cruise-operator Carnival Corp. rocketed higher by 18%, Southwest Airlines jumped 9% and the Walt Disney Company popped 6% as investors bet a vaccine may allow more vacationers to attend its many amusement parks.\n*****\n> \u201cI think that the rally is justifiable. I think we\u2019re going to start a new discussion, and the discussion is what\u2019s America going to look like post Covid,\u201d said CNBC\u2019s \u201cMad Money\u201d host Jim Cramer. \u201cIf you think about where we were last week, where we felt that there was very little chance to be able to stop this thing, now suddenly we have hope.\u201d\n*****\n> The Monday rally for equities also marked the first trading day after NBC News projected that former Vice President Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election against incumbent President Donald Trump. The call came four days after Election Day and amid close counts in several battleground states.\n*****\n> Wall Street hoped the victory for Biden would reduce the odds of a drawn-out election fight, even as Trump refused to concede. Many traders had put on bets for market volatility in November and were unwinding those positions, helping fuel a rally.\n*****\n> In the meantime, the chances of a \u201cblue wave\u201d that sweeps Democrats into the majority of both the Senate and the House have waned, meaning drastic policy changes such as tax hikes are less likely.\n*****\n> \u201cA Biden presidency with a Republican Senate would be unlikely to see any increase in taxes, which was arguably the biggest fear investors had about a Biden presidency,\u201d Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco, said in a note on Sunday. \u201cAnd a Biden presidency could mean a return to a more traditional, predictable approach to trade policy, which would likely result in less volatile markets.\u201d\n*****\n> Democrats are projected to keep their House majority, although Wall Street was watching closely as Senate control is still in limbo. Both of Georgia\u2019s Senate races are likely going to runoffs slated for early January.\n*****\n> Wall Street had rallied in the past week in anticipation for such a gridlocked government and was set to build on that rally as it gained clarity in the presidential race.\n*****\n> All three major averages just notched their best weekly performance since April. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq jumped 7.3% and 9%, respectively, last week, while the Dow rose 6.9%. The S&P 500 also posted its biggest election week gain since 1932.\n*****\n> Tech was the biggest winner last week among the 11 S&P 500 sectors, surging 9.7%. Investors piled into the high-growth group as the prospect of higher taxes and tighter regulations under a Democratic sweep decreased.\n*****\n\n# ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/08/election-stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html))"

This is a big reason why companies kept working on their vaccines even when it became clear that several early ones would beat them to market by many months: because this is a vaccine that we'll need for a long, long time, and not just 1 year.\n\nHopefully we will have widespread partial immunity and so the yearly COVID outbreaks might \"only\" kill tens or hundreds of thousands of people yearly without any widespread lockdowns.

     "OP DD is lacking, but the vaccine *may* be bigger than people expect (currently common sentiment is it\u2019s worth nothing and can\u2019t move the stock, as can be seen by other comments on this thread). In early February, projected 2020 revenues from the vaccine were $15B, with 20-30% margins and half of profits shared w Biontec. ~$2B is over 20% of their 2020 income. Since that projection, 500M+ orders came in, so at minimum revenues will be $20B. If a booster is required, it will be their most profitable treatment (currently pneumovax).\n\nThe viatris spinoff may seem like a negative at face value, but most would view it as a positive (after all, this is why Pfizer chose to spin them off). Viatris only holds off patent drugs, and was decreasing profits every year. Having shed the slowly dying Viatris, the expectation is for Pfizer to grow. W 80+ drugs in pipeline, 30+ phase 3 or just past phase 3, and covax goodwill likely improving their ability to raise drug prices, I like the odds."

Also this may not relate to you but they sure as hell relate to me and a lot others: DONT FUCK WITH OPTIONS UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU ARE DOING!!

     "I would not put the other 50 in. New vaccine companies are not that far behind Pfizer and when they release theirs (the other companies) those stocks will go up. Do your research on other vaccines coming out and put the money you were going to put into pfizer into the other companies. That\u2019s what I would do. If I were you I would hold your pfizer stocks and then aound May when the amount of people getting vaccinated starts to go down, pull it out. When the stock crashes, buy more. This is because in another couple years when the antibodies from the vaccines start to ware off, people will need to get covid vaccines again, and the stock will go back up. Hope my advice helps"

Recently, Pfizer announced that it will earn $15 BILLION in revenue during 2021, which it must split 50/50 with BIONTECH -- that's $7.5 BILLION!! And, BIONTECH's stock price ($114 per share) is, again, ridiculously undervalued relative to Moderna (which is $145 per share) and Novavax (which is $240 per share) and which, does NOT yet have an approved vaccine!! When BNTX reports its BLOCKBUSTER earnings this year, its share price will soar!!!\"",

     "Markets reaction is weird. Think it just wants any excuse to sell right now.\n\nModerna prediction is that the MRNA jabs will switch to private sale from next year - they laid all this out to investors last month. They estimate the market for private sales in US will be between $5bn and $19bn per year depending on who gets it. Interesting approach is that MRNA and Pfizer are in discussion with Health Insurance Companies who have to pay out in the event of hospitalisation so theory is the HICs will mandate annual jabs for their customers or premiums are higher. Moderna\u2019s jab has a higher success rate preventing hospitalisation so they think they\u2019ll have a better sales pitch with the HICs. Moderna think the cost per Jab will rise from $15 to between $75-$100 once it goes private, but obviously fewer customers.\n\nModerna also rolling out their MRNA Flu Vaccine which is in late stages and expected to be available early 2023 - it\u2019s showing better success than current annual flu jabs. The holy grail will be the combined Flu/Covid MRNA jab but so far Moderna have had poor results with their combined jab efforts. They have two other MRNAs in stage 3 trials not sure what the market is for them. They also have a anti cancer MRNA but can\u2019t see how that can be made profitable since it\u2019s a tailored MRNA to an individual so unless you have Platinum Insurance cover or a millionaire, don\u2019t see how this is profitable. \n\nI bought more MRNA yesterday on the sell off\u2026..their pipeline of MRNAs are getting closer and if they have an annual FLU jab and a Covid Jab in the private market their revenue will double while their PE will move to something more pharma normal. All of that ignores them doing a deal with China which would be a game changer - don\u2019t see that happening personally as Chinese have 2 MRNA vaccines under trial themselves. \n\nOn the Moderna law case against BioNTech for patent infringement, read an article by a science patent lawyer who has looked at the case. His take is interesting. BioNTech scientists were using the technique Moderna say was infringed as long ago as 2006 and they even filed patents on it, however he reckons these patents weaken Moderna\u2019s case but doesn\u2019t make it go away and he thinks Moderna will get a partial victory of sorts. He doesn\u2019t think it\u2019ll go to court but thinks instead the Patent Office will make a ruling (perhaps even this year) and whatever they say will deliver an out of court settlement. \n\nWe are just scratching the surface on MRNA tech and with their Covid profits Moderna have been rapidly upscaling their R&D. I think we are going to see a lot of amazing MRNAs come forward in the next 3-5 years that will game change medicine. The important thing about the tech is that Covid took a 10 year approval process on MRNA tech and made it a 1 year process. Anything that Moderna bring forward to CDC for approval is practically cleared inside the stage process so any new vaccine or drug can hit the market really quickly\u2026.RoCs on MRNA are going to be like nothing the pharma industry has ever seen before!"

     "OK, I agree that psychoactive substances are going to be a positive step toward treating mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder and depression (just look at the high rate of effectiveness of ketamine for treatment resistant depression and rapid reversal of acute depression associated with suicidal ideation) as well as ADHD. But to say there aren't already effective treatment for substance use disorder and that \" Recent studies have shown that low doses of psilocybin are as effective as the industry standard SSRIs! \" is overstating things a bit.\n\nThere was ONE study which compared microdosing of psilocybin to ONE antidepressant in the SSRI category,  escitalopram. The sample size was very small and promising but many further studies need to be done. In addition, SSRIs may be the first line choice for newly diagnosed persons with depression, however there are still the choices of SNRIs like cymbalta, tricyclics like amytriptilline, SARIs like Brintellix and  & atypicals such as Wellbutrin. Microdosing of psilocybin will take place in a galaxy far, far away, and likely only ever be used for people who have failed at least 2 standard treatments. \n\nAs far as the usage of MDMA, DMT, LSD are concerned, they are being tested to be used in CONJUNCTION with psychotherapy because they open a persons mind and make it easier for them to discuss tough issues with their therapist. They are not being studied to replace current standard treatment for depression, but to augment the effectiveness of therapy.\n\nMindMed is definitely on the right track, especially since they took over a phase 2 study at a University Hospital in Switzerland with an excellent reputation. \n\nI plan on buying and holding MindMed, but at this point it's a risky trade and could go to zero as easy as it can climb up and give big returns.\n\nIt also has competition here in the states. I don't believe they have any active studies in the US, whereas there are at least 2 (I think Emmes and Compass) are carrying out studies in the US.\n\n\\>"

     "I did a 10 page DD on GTHX about 3 months ago, but it got such a lukewarm reception (though I never posted it on reddit) that I made my position and tabled it. I could find it if there is any interest but my thoughts were that this one was going to be a 20-40 bagger but 3-7 years down the road (or it could be bought out somewhere along the way, I believe this is very likely for this company), and this is based entirely on Triciclib.  \n\nI gave the Rintodestrant a value of about a billion but as you state its risky and the actual value could end up being far more than that and could also end up being 0.  It may work better than fluvestrant or maybe not (I thought it probably did, at least for some patients).  Their other drug candidates (aside from Triciclib) had, in my opinion, minimal value.\n\nFor Triciclib, however, I figured the revenue stream for the SCLC approval could eventually be as much as 500-700 million a year in the USA alone.  if they are able to actually get revenue anywhere near this, this could cause the stock price to double or triple. However, they are going thru testing of Triciclib with various other forms of cancer.  If the Triciclib works in the other forms of cancer (and it really should, the mechanism by which Triciclib works has nothing to do with the type of cancer so long as the cancer isn't in the red bone marrow itself - where Triciclib works) then these new revenue streams could add 15-22 times the revenue of SCLC, the one approval they currently have.  This could mean a new revenue stream of maybe 10 billion and could mean a 20-40 bagger, though there are risks and you do need to be willing to hold for maybe 3-7 years.\n\nAnyhow, that's my 2 cents worth.  Rintodestrant might be great and could make them a lot of money but focusing on that is like saying Tesla makes a lot of money off their charging stations - you are missing the goose that lays the golden egg, in my opinion (but I'm just a retard who may know nothing about anything - do your own DD)."

     "Those are not opposing theories. Both of these things are true.\n\nIn general, most revenues inflate, too. People forget that, somehow.\n\nHowever, that phrasing of P/E ratios coming down is sortof cart-before-horse. P/E ratios come down-to-Earth as/if growth stocks lose ground.\n\nBut right now, we've got a lot of high P/E stocks that are not growth stocks, they're just fad stocks. With a real growth stock, the company should be growing, not just the stock price. The high P/E should reflect not only trader preference for the stock, but that the company is more able to invest in growth, which brings down earnings in the short term but is good in the long term, so increases the price. For these fad stocks, inflation can put some emphasis on math that as people try to calculate inflation effects, and that emphasis can become very painful for those investors. This is a bigger potential problem than just growth stocks getting a correction.\n\nAnd there are a lot more truths about inflation, too. For example, companies that can easily raise prices are less affected. Basically that's most companies where the limit on pricing is competition. Like with food, drinks, entertainment. Inflation already means those companies must have higher revenues. There are lots of websites that talk about this and list examples."

Market participants are eager to extend gains after a historic November performance. The Dow posted its biggest monthly gain since January 1987 with an advance of nearly 11.9%. In the S&P 500, the energy, financials, and industrials sectors led the indexs 10.8% rise, as market participants rotated back into many of the names that had been beaten down the hardest earlier on during the pandemic in the wake of positive vaccine news.\\n\\nThe positive vaccine news led analysts to raise their predictions for 2021 after Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN) each reported promising vaccine data in their clinical trial, raising hopes that an effective solution to the pandemic could roll out relatively soon.

But if u don\u2019t feel the same way I\u2019ll be here waiting for the tommorows update"

An apparent dispute between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve also weighed on the minds of market participants.\\n\\nIn Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said during a press conference that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-KY) agreed to pick back up stimulus negotiations. However, given the tenuous political situation surrounding the presidential election and the gridlock that exists in the Senate (majority for the Senate is still undecided), it is highly unlikely that any form of stimulus is passed. For months, Congress and the White House went back and forth regarding stimulus but were unable to come to an agreement. In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that '",

Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around a coronavirus vaccine and other treatments. The Nasdaq (QQQ outperformed the market, finishing 2.24% up. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.76% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed, finishing 0.1% down.\\n\\nThis week, so-called reopening stocks, like cruise-lines, airlines, hotels, and brick-and-mortar stores rallied on the backs of Pfizers vaccine announcement. Hopes that drug-makers are closing in on developing and getting approval for a coronavirus vaccine stoked consumer confidence in getting out and traveling. \\n\\nThe jump in reopening stocks came at the expense of tech stocks that have so far greatly outperformed the broader market throughout the pandemic. This week, the Nasdaq posted back-to-back declines of more than 1% before today while the Dow Jones gained around 4%. Same story in the '",

     "I assume they applied for EUA with their interim data of 50% efficacy. So that's probably what the FDA will be primarily looking at. \n\nHowever, the huge drop implies in their second half of the trial the efficacy was around 10%. With a sample size this big it's really unlikely this is due to just statistical variations. It could be a sudden trend reversal due to delta, which would make Molnupiravir pretty much useless by now. \n\nAnother possibility is they cherry picked a sub group of high risk people for their interim analysis. It would make sense since their orders with the US are conditional on EUA approval and they are gonna allow generic manufacturing in poorer countries anyways. In that case it could be granted EUA just for this subgroup, certainly though the FDA is not gonna simply ignore that if they did.\n\nMolnupiravir's Mechnism of Action is basically mutating enough errors into the viral replication so that the replication fails. There is potentially the danger of mutating human DNA as well with unkown long term side effects. On top of that, new variants could evolve faster by this mutation accelerator. \n\nMerck's drug looks more and more like a very expensive and ineffective burden with unkown risks involved. My guess is Pfizer's Paxlovid will probably be the answer for high risk population as an antiviral agent and Bucillamine potentially the pill for standard risk population as an anti-inflammatory agent. Even combination of both will be considered since their MOAs work complementary."

Is there some difference to the Pfizer pill that means there are patients who can take Merck's but not Pfizer? That's the real question. If not, then they probably don't get approved. But if they don't know the answer to that yet, and it appears safe, then it gets approved anyway, and the doctors can figure out which to use."

The current surge in infections and hospitalizations across the US emphasizes the need for an effective vaccine to combat the virus. Despite record infections, the market has been broadly encouraged by the steady stream of good vaccine news the last three weeks.\\n\\nOver the weekend, AstraZeneca (AZN) and the University of Oxford announced the results of their clinical trail which showed their vaccine candidate was highly effective at 90%, relatively cheap, and easy to store. The results are based on analysis of a study involving 11,363 participants in the UK and Brazil. Moreover, the company announced the vaccine can be stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees Celsius (36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning distribution can be done with existing infrastructure. These developments came on the heels of Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX'",

Price has behaved differently last few days, which is to say good. Don't know if MM manipulation behind us (it never really is) but at least price was free to move up.  When they post Q1 results it's very likely price will move up again as the benefit of a full qtr of vaccine rev/profit will reveal itself. And not being a one-trick pony, PFE has much to crow about of late, e.g., cancer drug and FDA approval 3/3. And. by the way, the PFE vaccine is hands-down the best of the vaccines with gov'ts worldwide buying in... Brazil may be next. I like the where it's going."

Today, Pfizer announced it had concluded its Phase 3 trial and found its vaccine candidate to be 95% effective against COVID-19, up from the 90% effectiveness reported last week and roughly the same rate as the vaccine candidate Moderna (MRNA) is developing. According to the company, Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics; observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%.

     "This is not as straightforward as it looks.\nFor those who are not as familiar with Abus as I am just a couple of words of warning. \n\n1) This court case is NOT an infringement case, it is a case brought by Moderna to try to say that Arbutus' claims are not patentable. If the court rules again that the 22 claims are patentable then it does not mean that Moderna have to pay yet.\nTo get an injunction you have to prove it is in the public interest this cannot happen in this case as it is a vaccine. So Abus has no legal avenue to stop them. The likelihood is that Moderna will continue to drag it out for a number of years. Assuming they will settle is a risky strategy.\n\n2) Arbutus have ATM shares to sell, primed and ready, they cannot hold a gain. You will experience 10% dilution in a very short space of time.\n\n3) Be aware that Genevant basically own Abus. They have the option to increase their ownership to over 50% later this year, talk of a buyout is pumper talk (or ignorance) and extremely unlikely.\n\nI'm not saying don't buy Abus but I have done a lot of DD and I would strongly advise you to take the spike and leave, it will not hold the gain.

In 2014, Opko gave **Pfizer** ([NYSE:PFE](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/pfizer-inc/pfe/)) an exclusive license to market growth hormone somatrogon globally. Pfizer paid Opko $295 million up front with the opportunity for Opko to receive up to $275 million in contingent milestone payments. Opko stands to receive tiered royalties on somatrogon's potential sales from the high teens to mid-20s. Those royalties seem more likely than ever now. Pfizer plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval for somatrogon by the end of this year. The big drugmaker expects to submit for approval of the drug in Europe and Japan in the first half of 2021. \n\nStreet rumor see public info - BlackRock may want to purchase #OPKO income streams. #OPKO is also a potential takeover target of Pfizer due to the revenue sharing agreements already in place.  Plus a great pipeline of future opportunities. \n\nBased on internals Opko stock would look surprisingly cheap even if it not for the coronavirus market opportunity. Hedge funds and institutional investors are increasing their positions on the cheap, using shorts to artificially deflate the price. \n\nNOTE \u2013 I am just a retail trader like you. This is my own opinion on $OPK using public information available to all. **Do your own research before investing.** This short squeeze opportunity actually makes money and has a pipeline of new innovative products. \n\nTogether we change the world, and equalize wealth inequalities brought on by the stock market for decades. Stop socialism for the rich. \n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.opkobiologics.com/pipeline/product-candidates/hgh-ctp/](https://www.opkobiologics.com/pipeline/product-candidates/hgh-ctp/)\n\n[https://www.bioreference.com/](https://www.bioreference.com/)\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-team-130000046.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opko-healths-bioreference-laboratories-team-130000046.html)"

Here are out Top 3.**\n\n\\- **TherapeuticsMD: Ticker \u201cTXMD\u201d-**\n\n**Currentytrading   at about $1.80, TXMD has a 1 year estimated target price from analyst   of $6.83. Combined that with 25% Short Interest and Insiders and/or   Institutions 73% of the float and/or tradeable shares, the actual short   interest is closer to 100% of the tradable float. Look for a big pop in   TXMD is the short squeeze happens, if not, it will still be a 2-3X   within 12 months.**\n\n**:**\n\n\\- **Clovis Oncology, Inc.: Ticker \u201cCLVS\u201d:**\n\n**Currently   trading at $8.91, CLVS is one of the top stocks on the NASDAQ. CLVS is   presenting updates on their oncology(cancer) drug on February 8th. We   expect good results and a squeeze to take place shortly thereafter.   Institutions hold 61%+ with Blackrock recently increasing their holdings   significantly. Also, 42% of the float is short so this could be a big   mover next week.**\n\n\\- **Precigen, Inc.: Ticker \u201cPGEN\u201d:**\n\n**Curently   trading at $7.95, Precigen may be one of the most overlooked stock and   short plays in the US. The recently closed on a Public Offering of   17,250,000 @ $7.50 giving them gross proceeds of $129.4 million. Some of   the biggest institutions participated in that financing, showing a lot   of support in the company. 80% of the Float is owned by institutions,   while insiders own another 18% or 98-99% of the float held by long term   investos.** **With 35% of   the float being short, in our opinion, the tradeable float well over   100% and this could be another GME scenario as their innovative gene and   cell therapies are world class. Also, they are presenting at the   Guggenheim Healthcare Talks Oncology Day on Friday, February 12, 2021.**\n\n**This is not financial advice, while we believe in our Due Diligence, please do your own before you invest.**\n\n**Save Companies, take down the shorts. #YOLO**\n\n**KillerB -** **#STRENGTHINNUMBERS**"

Novavax has a pretty small market cap and they look like they have very good growth potential. Along with their COVID-19 vaccine, they have a flu vaccine and they can make lots of money off that.

Pfizer has amazing dividends and they have pretty good value (dividends of 4.5% and trading at 11.5 expected earnings). They're also quite big so if all goes wrong with their COVID-19 vaccine, their other products might save them from a crash.\\n3. **ConocoPhilips (COP)** Energy stocks, in general, are really good for 2021.

Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum.

     "Your investment thesis is that you purchased it today and its up 1.5%? are you kidding.  I first bought SRPT in February 2014 when it was around $30, i added to it through 2018, occasionally playing options coming up on big FDA dates. I held through the bad when the adcom went poorly and it dropped to $11, wiping out almost my entire investment, and losing 5 figures overnight when my options went to nothing. \n\nThere was a point in time that i think i knew more about the company than anyone not on a Sarepta w-2. i had a friend that worked at an elite college in biostatics look over all the data i could gather from the studies. i watched every minute of the adcom, i read every release. It was what i thought was the best investment i had ever come across to date. I think there were 2 analysts covering the stock back then, and neither was paying attention. Ill never forget reading an analyst report that had failed to include the small detail that SRPT had raised something like $300m the prior month, yet spoke about running out of cash. Then Brian Skorney at Baird began covering it, and hes nailed it the whole way along. Hes the only one worth reading. \n\nLet me explain this to you very clearly: Small cap biostocks are not \"very safe investments\", and \"conservatively\" expecting +30-40% is moronic, mostly because its clear you havnt actually done the cash flows and figured out a real valuation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any questions, please send them my direction. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSincerely,\n\n# Long for 1981 days."
