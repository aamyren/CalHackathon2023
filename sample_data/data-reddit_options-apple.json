I got cautious yesterday, when I wanted to trade a June 9th 390 Call for NVDA yesterday, but high IV and overvaluation caused me to step back. \\n\\nMarket open, and price jumped up by $20, still really high IV, volume of trading and open interest looks like the bull run may go passed $450, the chart is just on a momentum too and FOMO + new catalysts keep adding that steroid liquidity and then some, although I feel like APPL is a safer bet\\n\\nWhat are yall sentiment, any one else trading APPL or NVDA? \\n\\n(I know many of yall that bought puts on NVDA getting crushed right now, its still going, market aint rational so rational strats wont work on this one, only Lady Luck cant guarantee that outcome for you)'",

     "I also am a believer in your bullish tech hypothesis.  In the money or near at the money LEAPS may be a prudent way to go depending on your risk tolerance. But perhaps a more cost-effective strategy would be to DOLLAR COST AVERAGE (DCA) into 1.5x Leveraged single stock ETFs such as MSFU (1.5x MSFT), AMZU (1.5x AMZN), GGLL (1.5x GOOG), AAPU (1.5x AAPL), and NVDL (1.5x NVDA).  \n\nMany self-righteous asshats on Reddit will probably bring up concerns regarding volatility decay of leveraged ETFs (although volatility decay with a 1.5x leveraged ETF isn\u2019t nearly as bad as compared to a 2x or 3x leveraged ETF, and a risk that can be mitigated with DCA), expense ratios of these ETFs (which is typically around 1%), \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just simply buy stocks on margin\u201d (like you want to deal with a potential margin call or pay margin interest rates of 7.5%+), as well as single stock risk/lack of diversification (a risk which is also present with LEAPS).  However, if you are comfortable with these risks, buying these 1.5x leveraged ETFs (most of which trade under $30 per share\u2026) on down days using DCA looks to be a somewhat safer alternative over LEAPS and still potentially benefitting from leverage.  \n\nGlad I got into a lot of these in late December 2022"

Alternatively if we believe we are in a bear market do the same with Puts.\nI buy Jan or Dec 25 Calls at about a delta .80 or 80 as some say, then I sell monthly or weekly calls intending to collect about 10% of the premium paid per month. Sometimes I buy  the call even deeper in the money. For example bought VALE calls at $5 and have been selling calls weekly. Same with F. Collect a \u201cDividend\u201d on the premium paid that is greater than I would if I held the stock.\n\nIn 10 months I recover the premium ( sometimes 12 months) and could buy the stock at the strike price or sell the long options.\n\nI did this with Puts on IWM over 5 months - yes, less than a year and it worked well. Am doing  it with SPY puts that should unwind Jun 16 and if I liquidated yesterday would have returned 22% on the premium over 6 months. A lot less than the IWM returned over 5 months.\n\nIn this case IWM was on a down trend while SPY was on an uptrend.\n\nRemember that sometimes all the premium is not collected and the loss would be the net outstanding premium if stock closes below long call.\n\nIt\u2019s about risk management and risk appetite."

     "I've been looking into this myself recently, and here are my conclusions so far:\n1. Deep ITM far LEAPs are a relatively safe way to gain leverage on a \"buy and roll\" long term strategy. That is, you identify a stock you are bullish on in the long term, buy at a price point where extrinsic value is negligible, and hold for a long time, rolling when necessary (basically, until you stop believing in the company). This can get you close to double the bang for your buck.\n2. Main caveats are tax events when rolling and missing out on dividends. That means you want a stock where most of the total return comes from growth and buybacks. Again, the loss of extrinsic value is real, but it can be quite small.\n3. Collecting premium on short term calls is an assumption you know short term stock movements better than the market. You don't, and would be safer just holding your LEAPs.\n\nAs for your specific question around timing for these stocks, no one really knows. Find a great company at a fair value and this strategy should work. If you don't like the stress of rolling options the tax events etc., just buy and hold the stock."

How you determine what moneyness calls to buy depends on the CAGR you are assuming for the model. \n\nRegardless \u2014 pls for the love of god don\u2019t sell naked calls or puts. That kind of degeneracy is best left for wsb"

These stocks tend to have reasonably high liquidity and can offer decent premiums, though you should assess each stock's suitability for your strategy and risk tolerance.\n\nTo discover more stocks suitable for this strategy, check out articles on the [best stock picking service](https://joywallet.com/article/best-stock-picking-services/). These resources provide well-researched and analyzed stock suggestions, which help you identify suitable candidates for covered calls and cash-secured puts."

     "The most critical part of the wheel is the stocks you choose to trade it on, so carefully research and select stocks you would be good buying and holding for some time if needed.\n\nHaving a list of diversified stocks across market sectors can help as these may not drop at the same time or by the same amount.  Some will drop while others may not.\n\nLook at the 11 sectors to research the top or best stocks in each as you build your list.  I don't pay attention to what premiums the stocks pay while vetting them, but will look when it is time to trade them.  The premiums will vary so these will go up and down over time and it is more important to trade stocks that are less likely to drop and often move back up faster if they do.

Minimum Div of 2% yield, and at least $2.00 annual payout, quarterly\n4. IV between 25 - 75\n5. Price between $x to $y based on your account size and risk tolerance\n6. Then, trending above its 200 EMA, and good bid/ask pricing. Check the bid/ask prices in the front week and 42DTE week to see strike selection and tight pricing\n7.

During the recent rally AAPL stayed below 170, so it's highly likely that AAPL will not rally above 170 in the coming week, so if you sell the 170/172.5 call spread (1 of them) you will pocket $19.

The value is about .12 or $12 (you don't say what you paid for it) so I can't comment on how much this has lost. \n\nThe probability will continue to drop and theta decay will continue dropping the value unless the stock makes a very fast and strong move down, and a lot more than 1%, over the last 6 days the trade has left.

     "I hold more than 6 figures in pure Apple stock, plus whatever exposure from various mutual funds and ETFs.  I'm also a lot older than you are I'd wager.\n\nSo with those facts as perspective on my advice - \n\nBuy the stock.  \n\nThe competitive computer landscape doesn't appear set for any major disruption to my eyes.  There are software operators (MSFT) and hardware operators (Dell, though they went private), and there isn't a company out there with the ethos of unifying hardware and software through design like Apple.  \n\nApple has been a long time coming, and perhaps the closest business in terms of \"build don't buy\" is Tesla.  You really need to understand that Apple computers are designed in the same way that the *machines that build the computers* are designed by Apple.  For every iPhone you see, they've built or bought up and refined the tooling that produces that device.  \n\nIt goes really, really deep.  Much deeper than any of their competitors.  The question remains then, will consumers prioritize the fact that there is a bit of a luxury tag on any Apple product?\n\nFor nearly 15 years the answer has been yes - again and again and again.\n\nSo ask yourself, \"what will make people change their behavior?\" because the evidence of recent history proves that we want slick tech.  *Globally*\n\nApple also has an enormous pile of cash.  They aren't so quick to act in some cases, you could argue they would have done well to buy Netflix years ago as it fits their \"intersection of technology and the arts\" mentality, but when they do make decisions, they get things very right more often than not.\n\nThe new M1 architecture does a couple things - to the public, it cements this idea that Apple is a technology leader, but to their balance sheet, it represents a huge bump in profitability.\n\nJudging purely by the jump in gross margin according to their most recent 10K, they're optimizing their COGS to massive benefit.\n\nhttps://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/42ede86f-6518-450f-bc88-60211bf39c6d.pdf\n\n2019 Gross Margin Product 32.2%\n\n2020 31.5%\n\n2021 35.3%\n\nTheir effective tax rate dropped, their cost of sales stayed flat (despite COVID and store closing - they still have the pay the lease -14.6 B USD annually!), their R&D stayed constant *as a percentage* of their revenue (more rev, more R&D budget, more and better products and services faster), basically, everything that should go up has gone up, and everything that should go down has gone down.\n\nThey report 34.9 B USD in *cash* on hand (and we know that they have more abroad).\n\nIf the US Housing Market had been managed the way that Apple has been managed, it could not have crashed.\n\nSo when you hear posters here saying \"they said it couldn't happen to X and look what happened\" tell yourself that's total bullshit.  When companies \"suddenly crash\" there were smoke signals - OR they're just straight up lying to the SEC, which is a felony, and has landed more than one CFO in actual prison.  There were people who saw the housing market collapse coming (not me) because they looked at the data.\n\nWhen I read the 10K, I don't see any skeletons in the closet.  The only thing that could knock Apple down would be consumer habits changing, and I really don't see us giving up tech... ever."

I was torn like you because i was limited on outings couldn't sell off part of my positions since i only had 1, & wanted to lock in profit. So what i did was, sold on a red day, took the profits and bought 2024 leaps that are now up 100%+. But the key to both was buying around witching (on red days) & buying the furthest out i could get. Sure you take a minor haircut by selling on a red day but when you're up so much, it's a good sacrifice because you're buying the dip and reading that upside. I'm not a sophisticated trader or anything by any means, I just use this simple strategy and focus on getting a minimal 200% gain before exiting. \n\nBuy the dip. \nBuy around witching after new contracts are released. \nPlan your exit prior to entry. \nHave your next play lined up prior to selling, to avoid fomo & other emotions. \nStick to the script. \nOh! And i buy pretty close to the money. Ie, my smh 2024 leaps are for 335.\n\nHope that helps! But you've gotten great advice that i had to bookmark lol."

Essentially you can always be long with the same $ amount but increase or decrease your leverage based on if you think it's over bought or oversold. Ex: If you think it's pulled back to far you can sell some stock and buy options with a Delta greater than the stock you sold.\n\nFor apple in particular I would actually urge a little caution on just holding it open.

     "ATM call requires a lot of extrinsic value (premium) and the price has to move a lot higher. Markets go up, but that's not a guarantee - check what happened to SNAP last week.\n\nWhat people usually do is to buy LEAPS: delta 80 or even higher.\n\nFor Google (GOOG), current price is 2772, delta 80 call for January 2023 is strike 2200 is 700 bucks (approx since bid ask difference is high).\n\nDifference between strike (2200) and CMP (2772) is 572 bucks so you are paying a premium of 128 bucks - that's all. Total risk however is 70K (the price you paid) since google can crash below 2200, right?\n\nATM call is 350 bucks BTW and all of that is extrinsic value - if google does not move, you lose 35K.\n\nNext step - people write short term calls above the current price to reduce their risk. If I write a delta 20 call for December, I get 30 bucks per contracts or 3000 bucks. This gives me a lot of room for stock to rise before the call is in loss, but if the price does not move much or goes down, it reduces my cost by 30 bucks (starting point was 700 total 128 premium). 4-5 more writes like this and my call goes free, or you can be more aggressive and write a 30 delta, 40 delta or even ATM call - completely your choice. ATM call right now (for december) is 100 bucks, if price does not move, you can pay your premium in just this + 1 more roll, but this leaves absolutely no room to the upside.\n\nAnyways, that's how people make bank.\n\nSee also: poor man's covered call.\n\nEdit - Even if you did not want to do the short call jugglery, and your assumption is that the price will be higher in a year - all you paid for the LEAPS is 122 bucks - if the price moves higher than 122 - google goes beyond 2900 - you make money. You do need to put more capital (700 vs 350) though but the odds and adjustments are higher with LEAPS since you need to fight / recover only smaller amount of premium."

     "I started trading options in my 40\u2019s and lost big time because I took purely directional bets (buy puts and calls). Total suckers game long term as the house (those who sell options) alway win. The market has three directions.. up, down, sideways and Theta is still at work in any direction. This is why the sellers win. When you move away from pure direction with things like picking an underlying you wouldn\u2019t mind owning, buying a Bull Call Spread with a put sell to pay for it, you see very different gains. These are slower yet more effective long term. \n\nFor small portfolios, buy a few deep ITM LEAPS hope you get a good pop and sell for a profit or sell higher strike calls to creat a spread. \n\nI rarely buy stock unless they have a dividend and I like them. Even then, I typically buy 1/2 position of stock and sell ATM put/call LEAPS. this gives me the dividend + premium which can easily be 20% per year. If assigned, I buy a stock I like. Then wash-rinse-repeat. \n\nNot for everyone, but more low touch and easier to sleep at night"

The efficient market hypothesis is true for large part and long run. (See price action when an acquisition is announced)\n\n2. When you buy ATM, the underlying has to go up enough just to break even (your break even = strike + premium paid).\n\n3. What if those companies have 1-2 bad years, say anti trust investigations putting downward pressure, you lose 100% if the underlying is below its strike.\n\n4. LEAPS give you lots of leverage, leverage could work for or against you.\n\nGeneral advice and a sane thing to do is, buy deep ITM LEAPS with a small portion of your portfolio that wouldn't destroy you if lost completely."

You can hedge by shorting the new ATM call in the same expiration. \n\nIf the stock has risen to the the point where the credit for shorting the new ATM call is more than than what you paid for your original LEAP and more than the spreads between your strikes, then you have completely removed downside risk. This strategy generally work better with an OTM LEAP meaning you have to be super super bullish.\n\nJust to be sure to stimulate the trade with options profit calculator or optionstrat to make sure you're clear on all aspects of the new trade. This hedging strategy is basically legging into a bull call spread or debit call spread but you get a credit for legging in if the original trade goes your way.\n\nObligatory this is not financial advice and YMMV."

     "Lots of good thoughts in this thread that need to be unpacked a little bit.\n\n1. In regards to the original question, one of the greeks, \"theta\" will erode the time value of your option over time regardless of what happens to the price and you will end up with zero.  A better long term strategy is what Warren Buffett does, sell far out in time puts on SPX and let time decay work in your favor.  SPX \"always\" goes up over enough time and he takes the premium that is deposited into his account and buys other companies with it.  Options sellers have a statistical advantate (70-80%) and are \"the house\" or the \"insurance company.\"  I do these all the time, bull put or bear call vertical credit spreads, and you have to know what you're doing or you'll blow your feet off, but they're very good, consistent income producing trades.  \n2. Regarding Slim Margins 1999 comment, knowing how and when to exit is way more important than when/how to enter. It's ridiculously easy to watch a good trade go south.\n3. Campinbgbushes is on the right track with short time frames.  Time is the enemy of the option buyer and the friend of the option seller, but only to a point.  Too much time give the underlying time to move which can burn the seller.  For the buyer, something has to happen soon, the buyer has to be right about time, direction and price.  The seller just has to be right about where the market is not going to go, but time is noone's friend in the end.\n4. MBHNYC and stop losses, I've found that \"mental\" stop losses are beter than physical ones.  Options pricing is so volatile that physical stop losses get whipsawed a lot, especially near the open and the close and as you get within a few days of expiration.  Stop losses are important, but not in the traditional sense of when you're trading stocks.\n5. Ohfat is on the right track using SPY, QQQ versus individual stocks.  Not as exciting but way, way more consistent.  If you're an option buyer, consider bull/bear debit spreads versus outright puts and calls.  Way less risk an plenty of potential.  It's all about getting \"an edge.\""

So recently I posted a strategy about trying to use DITM LEAPs on the SPY as a stock substitute to maintain cash for living expenses while maintaining a similar stock exposure to an original account. First thanks for everyones comments, they were great. \\n\\nSecond, about half of you mentioned wheeling or selling covered calls on the SPY (which CCs would have gotten destroyed this week on weeklies BTW).   Is there an optimum theta and delta that you guys look for when doing any of these strategies and why?  If you can please include rational for How income from one of these strategies BEATs buy and hold (in theory). Thanks!\\n\\nEdit 1:  I do understand that the wheel is an income strategy. \\n\\nI wonder how the CC/wheel strategy would fare against the strategy in my other post or if there is some way to test this?  I think it would be interesting - on one side you essentially created a loan situation where you are borrowing cash at a cost equal to the premium on a long leap. '",

My reasoning:\n\n* This means less money at stake.\n* If the short call is hit, so be it, the call you has gone up a lot. So just close it all out, put some cash aside, and reset with new ATM call. Maybe use same expiry for awhile.\n* Best case scenario (SPY goes up at proper rate) you will collect all you spent on the call. so zero risk.\n\nI used to use DITM calls like you regularly as my stock replacement, thinking a lot like you.  I've gradually moved to this strategy, buy ATM calls the shorting a .2ish delta.  It's all a matter of taste and what allows you to sleep at night. You are not wrong by any means.\n\ngood luck"

If you've got 40-50k free you can certainly wheel it with I think relative success, but it's going to be tricky selling CCs and holding the shares. The past 2 weeks have been a great example. After getting beaten down repeatedly SPY reversed and has rallied 30 points in 6 trading days. Now would probably be a good time to sell a CC, but if you were mindless/mechanical about it and sold a 425C just a few days ago you'd be very underwater now."

     "CC isn\u2019t a loan. It\u2019s basically a paid hedge that protects your long investment by allowing you to earn premiums as income that you can keep weekly or monthly however you play it. Obviously covered calls have some risk so don\u2019t choose highest premiums. Choose a weekly or monthly call with less 50 delta or lower. The lower the better. Don\u2019t worry too much about theta as with weekly CC, the sell option expires in a week. It is basically you selling to somebody who who wants to llay the lotto. Just make sure the strike price is high enough above your SPY investment so it makes it impossible to lose money if it hits, you make money no matter what. On the other hand, if SPY goes down, contract expires worthless and you can keep the full premium. If you set up the strike high enough where it is highly unprobable to hit by exp, you CC will become a nice weekly or monthly income while your money was gonna sit there anyways. Also, if the market goes down, you can buy to cover anytime to take profits on the short call early and just set up a new sell call and now collect on that premium. The great thing about covered calls is that you win if SPY goes up, and you win if SPY goes down, because you can always cover early for a smaller piece of the premium for profit if SPY goes down or just let it expire to collect the full premium at expiration, and if it goes up above the strike price at expiration, you will keep the full premium paid at expiration plus all capital gains up to the strike price.

In regards to the QQQ, but also the general market, there are two things I am looking at:\\n\\n* The market has been range-bound for roughly 6 weeks with no clear direction.\\n* We are back at the June 2021 lows, nearly 7 months of no returns.\\n\\nIve market both levels on the chart below.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1ri1jwcntaa1.png?width=2464&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eb92f61d8e3e01d50dcb085518e88301a85bb413\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis leads me to believe the charts are suggesting a short-term bottom and an entry with a favorable risk-reward may be approaching, depending on your time-frame of course.\\n\\nFurthermore, theres an increase in net positive option buying thats been going on under the hood of the market.

China announced a form of Covid that breaks through the vaccine BA.115 . 43% now in new US cases - here already - flush the toilets again . It\u2019s all perception- perception right now and for the most of 2023 is one of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Inflation , terminal rate  and for how long - margin and demand destruction , slumping retail and consumer, rising personal and national debt, exit multiple and terminal values , Ukraine , oil and energy it\u2019s endless. For this to turn gamma positive and accent to the upside , all of the aforementioned must subside significantly. \n\nIt\u2019s all about perception \n\nIt's all about bucks, kid. The rest is conversation.\n\n\nIt's not a question of enough, pal. It's a Zero Sum game - somebody wins, somebody loses.

In general, you want to select strikes whose delta is within the expected move of the event. Of course, *everyone* else in the market is doing the same thing, so the expected move is priced in and there won't be much leftover for profit.

Weekly IV was higher for the week to account for the FOMC rate decision on Wednesday, the Jobs number, and earnings reports from the likes of Apple, Alphabet Amazon and more. The majority of the market volatility occurred into and out of the FOMC event. So despite the final tally being less than what options were pricing the week featured a 4.5% rally from the lows of the week to the highs.\\n\\nThe QQQ was where the majority of the action was, finishing higher by about 3.4% on the week (versus a 2.8% expected move). The VIX was down slightly to 18.30, the lowest it has been in the past year. The next bit of a pop in IV this month is around the 14th for the next CPI where SPY IV pops from 14 to 17 (as seen on the expected move chart below). However, the CPI is becoming less of a market-moving event (in the eyes of option vol, as 17 IV is not high at all compared to recent months). I'",

For pairs trading, I prefer to remain in the price domain and use something like Comparative Relative Strength where you divide the price of one security by the price of the other.  If the issues correlate well, the graph of these quotients will ping back and forth in a range around zero. \r  \n\r  \nAnother way to approach it is to simply subtract the price of one security from that of the other.  It's the same idea as above except that you're plotting the actual price difference.\r  \n\r  \nIndicators like RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc. can be useful in identify a trend but any position taken is based on the hope that the trend continues. They predict nothing going forward.  They're all like looking in a rearview mirror, telling you where you have been. They'll work if you correctly guess the periodicity of the underlying but that is only truly known in hindsight."

     "If you own at least 100 shares of NVDA, and you sold a 195 covered call for $63, another alternative to earn $50-100 per month is selling out of the money call credit spreads on NVDA.  For example sell 1 Dec 23 195 Call for .79 and buy 1 for Dec 23 205 Call for .28 for a credit of $51. The short 195 call has a delta of 10 so a 10% chance of being in the money. Your risk is $949 which sounds high but it is off set by your stock in your portfolio so you\u2019ll just be flat from 195-205 (gain from the stock pays for the credit spread loss) should NVDA go to 195 or higher in the next two weeks. At above 205 your profit will start to rise again should NVDA close above 205 in two weeks. With this strategy you don\u2019t have to worry about any assignment for whatever your reason is for not wanting to sell the stock. If NVDA closes below 195 by 12/23, you don\u2019t have to do anything and you keep the premium.  If NVDA closes at 220, for example, your underlying would have gained $5k but your credit spread would have lost $949 but your are still positive $4k.  At least you don\u2019t have the possibility of being assigned and having to sell NVDA and pay taxes or whatever your reason is for not wanting to liquidate.  Just repeat selling the 10 deltas every two weeks and you can gain $100 a month.  Just my two cents.  I\u2019m sure there are other options traders with better ideas.\n\nEdit: Actually with a covered call you are capped out at whatever call strike you sold.  For example, if NVDA closes at 250 but you sold the 195 strike you make  $2,500 max plus credit (170-195) but the call buyer makes the difference from 195-250 minus the premium.  With this strategy, you continue to make money above 205 since you will be long 205 calls.  This strategy is better for unanticipated huge moves."

Q1: should I expect fidelity to cover any transfer fees? Ive never transferred out of an account before. \\n\\nI am in a little bit of debt so I need to bring in some premium off these. Looking at the chain I could sell weeklies pretty far OTM for $150 in premium. Seems like a pretty good bet ($190 strike). I will say I have kind of an emotional attachment to these shares as they were my first investment ever. Kind of dumb, I know. \\n\\nIf you were in my position, how would you handle this? Sell further out? Lower strike for more premium? I figure if they get called away Ill just sell outs and eventually probably buy them back. \\n\\nTired of watching these shares when I could collect some premium!\\n\\nChime in with some thoughts. \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/wfVBrir'",

DTC facilitates the transfer, it's electronic, takes a business day or two, and is done. \n\nSelling covered calls is a plenty good strategy to make your shares work for you, if you want. There's plenty of strategy and opinions on the way to do this.  Most usually revolve around selling slightly out of the money options at about 45 days out, since that's theoretically when theta decay starts to accelerate. But McMillian has the most sage advice: \"never sell covered calls on stock you aren't willing to part with.\"  Yes, you are giving up some upside, while adding some downside protection, but ultimately, if you aren't emotionally and financially willing to part with the shares, you may as well be selling naked calls."

On the other side, you can be the one writing the option, collecting the premium for the assumption of additional risk. I have read about many of the more popular strategies (the wheel, iron condor, etc), but many seem to have downsides where if things go really wrong, they go really wrong. In everyone's experience, is it better to be the one buying the options, writing the options, or using the strategies that mix the two?

Realize it\u2019s a gamble. Long options should only be held short term, don\u2019t wait around until expiration hoping for a move.\n\nIf I had the same expectation as you and wanted a long option I\u2019d buy the 4/21 $225 Call for $32.00 instead of 3/31 $270 call for $2.10 this will have more consistent reliable moves relative the underlying.

You'd be better off putting your money into a high interest savings account that is going to yield around 2.5% per year.\n\nIf you really want AAPL, I would say look at the delta of that particular put you are selling and then go to the monthly expiration and sell that same level of put each month.  You're looking at a likelihood of <1% being assigned and making a little bit of money each month. \n\nIf you get exercised early, your contract does disappear.  You get to keep all of the premium but you now own the 100 shares at your strike, regardless of what AAPL is trading at.

I'm expecting a big move in one or the other direction since it's trading at key support at a traditionally volatile time. Apple is at about $132, so let's say I buy the $129 put and $134 call expiring on 12/30. Since a 1% move often correlates with a 2x in an AAPL option expiring that week (at least as I have observed), would it make sense to ride one out and take profit and then just keep holding the other to see if the underlying eventually turns around? If not, then I just take my hedged gain from the successful option. Does this make any sense? Or is theta going to kill me?\"",

If aapl continues to drop and the time premium decays to close to zero, you should roll it out a few months and get paid more at the same strike price with a later date.  You can continue to do that, and ultimately I personally believe aapl will recover above your $130 strike price even if that doesn\u2019t happen until 2nd half 2023.  Meanwhile, you\u2019ll have rolled it several times and made money each time, which lowers your cost basis."

     "Keep in mind what can happen to the short Put you have based on price and IV...  Price of AAPL can go up, down, or sideways.  IF the price of AAPL goes up (as it is today while I type this..) or sideways, the value of the Put will come in, which will mean you start to gain on your trade.  If the Price of AAPL goes lower, your Short Put will increase in value, and the trade will go against you.  The other main factor is IV; while options decay with time, the IV going up will offset that.  IF IV goes lower, the price of the option will go lower.  Since you're going into an earnings period, IV  (IV is perceived risk of movement in a why, or uncertainty ...) will stay firm or increase.  \n\n\nAt expiration -- 45 days from now -- your breakeven on this trade is about 123.25 or so.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome other comments-- risk of assignment, mentioned below-- is very unlikely.  In fact if you were assigned right now on the position (\\*VERY VERY Unlikely\\*) you should be happy.  Because there is so much premium in the trade.  You would keep all that money you got for selling the put.  Yes, the price could go quite a bit lower, and then you might have assignment risk, but this is AAPL.  The most traded Single stock underlying on the board I'd guess.  So a HUGE move is not likely until earnings.  Not impossible, but not likely.    \n\n\nEarnings and the move -- Options and their IV are good indicators for how much the market expects price to move over the life of the option.  You have earnings on Jan 26. Which is during the FEB expiration cycle.  You can take the sum of the ATM put and ATM call in that expiration, and use that number as a general idea of the expected move of the underlying.  Also, some good options firms will show you that expected move on their platform for you.  This number, based on the current IV and how long it is until expiration, is basically giving you a 1 standard deviation move number.  So for AAPL, the current expected move is 12.22 (up or down...)  Understanding this, and standard deviations , are very important imo for trading options and understanding the risk you have on.  \n\n\nSelling the other side -- you can sell a call against your existing position -- selling both sides -- is always something to consider, and imo generally a good idea.  You think you know which way AAPL is going, but you really don't.  Why not get the benefit of the short call as well?  \n\n\n\"You have unlimited risk..\" -- this was mentioned somewhere in the comments.  This stuff drives me crazy.  First, you do not have unlimited risk in this case.  Technically, you have risk to Zero.  AAPL could I guess go to zero dollars.  But a couple of things.  1) it is terribly unlikely that the most widely held technology company on the planet is going to zero.  IF this was some sort of goofy meme stock, or new medical device company, sure-- more risk of the underlying going to zero.  And, stocks like that are good ones to avoid because they are not very liquid.  Liquidity is very important...  and 2) \\*IF\\* a stock like AAPL goes to zero tomorrow, you and I and everyone else have much bigger problems than your short put.  \n\n\nA much better indication of your perceived risk in this position is to (assuming you're in a normal margin account) just look at how much the broker is holding as margin against the position.  For AAPL, without any kind of Portfolio Margin account or anything, the margin is about $2500.  So the risk that the Broker feels like you have is about that much.  Were the price to go against you, that amount would increase, and they could ask for more margin, but as a general rule, that is your risk.  \n\n\nShort Puts are a great way to dip your toe into options trading.  You can see what happens when price changes, when IV changes, and when time changes -- all with a pretty basic trade.  And, it's a long position, which is a great way to start out.    \n\n\nNo idea what AAPL is going to do in the next week, or month.  But the IV is up in the options, and that is a great time to sell some options!  Good Luck."

     "I don\u2019t know how you feel being short a naked put going through AAPL earnings since you have unlimited risk at the moment.  One way to protect yourself is to diagonalize it by buying a Mar 125 put for $8.10.  This will put you at a total debit of 1.33 for the trade (-8.10+6.77).  If AAPL gaps down to $100 your max loss is $5 since your Mar 125 puts will be deep ITM to offset the Feb 130 puts you sold. If AAPL stays at 125 by Feb expiration, the Feb 130 you sold will be worth $5 and your Mar 125 puts will be worth roughly around $6-7 (all Greeks being equal) and you should be able to close out for a credit. If AAPL is at 130 by Feb expiration, the Feb 130 will expire worthless and your Mar 125 puts will be worth roughly around $4-5 all the other Greeks being equal.  Then you can either sell to close completely or you calendarize it by selling the Mar 125 put weeklies for a small credit. Or you can just close it now for a small loss and not worry about earnings.  If you wait and decide to close it out 1-2 days before earnings, there\u2019s a good chance you will end up paying a higher IV since it will be closer to earnings. You might end up paying over $10 even if AAPL stays at the same price as today due to increase IV. It all depends how the market prices it."

This frees up more margin, to increase the size in the other one, that stands to benefit. \n\nAnyway. In the long term you'll lose money by buying options."

     "Of you are already up now just watch that daily chart, as soon as you see those green candlesticks start to shrink sell it(the guy who explained theta decay to you in your other post). Right now you are outpacing theta decay, the moment that buy momentum slows down the theta will start to eat your gains, as long as buying pressure(green daily candles) don't start shrinking you're in good shape. If you see them getting smaller sell to lock in those gains. Glad it worked out for you, but don't let it burn down chasing higher gains(that's how I lost the majority of my bets). That's also what options sellers bank on, remember how I told you 45 days out is when theta really starts to ramp up. Theta farmers sell options 30-45 days out banking on exactly that, that the theta decay will outpace the gains of the underlying."

AAPL has been sitting there doing nothing all year so IV is really low, that\u2019s likely to rise as we get closer to earnings. Plus for the folks saying it\u2019s a giant float that doesn\u2019t move, it\u2019s gone from 133 to 137 this week. A similar move now would get you close to your break even point. Also if you believe technical analysis it\u2019s right at a resistance and if it pushes through could run above 140 pretty quickly. The weekly indicators also give it room to keep pushing up.\n\nOnly thing I would watch is the market reaction to the CPI data in two weeks. If QQQ dives off of that I would bail."

Buy the call. How many can you (really) afford? 2? 3? contracts. Can you buy 1/4 of a contract? Oh, right, no.\n\nIf you are already broke, you can't go no deeper, plus you are in college, it's not someone over on WSB doing some Yolo. (Plus you can always move back to Mom & Dad and eat hotpockets)\n\nAnd I hope you lose some, maybe 30-40% and get a cheap education. Because if you come out a winner on the first rodeo, woooooooooooo boy, you ARE gonna get hurt later. That animal (Bull or Bear) is gonna put such a hurtin' on yo ass, even them circus clowns can't save ya.\n\nBut, but, but!! It is the perfect opportunity to maybe get your toes wet, (if you really want to jump into the deep end) and hey, if you want to Think or Swim (pardon the expression); I say, do it.\n\nYou have a whole career, lots of of time to make up for this little blip of loss, and potentially, it can give/teach you (valuable or it is a cheap) lessons that will make you \ud83e\udd11\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb2\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nBut again, do your own DD, and DO NOT, NEVER, EVER, TRUST SOME RANDOM POSTER on Reddit.

That SPY move higher followed a 5% rally the week before. It is now about 10% above the recent lows. QQQ was up about 2.2% on the week, underperforming the broader market and weighed down by those earnings reports. QQQ is now about 8% higher than its recent lows. The Dow is about 14% higher.\\n\\nVolatility fell across the board, with the VIX now below 26, both because of the move higher but also with a huge percentage of the SPX market cap now having reported.\\n\\n**This Week **SPY options are pricing about a 2.5% move for the upcoming week. That implies a move of just under $10 in either direction. The VIX closed last week under 26, its lowest levels since mid September but still higher than average. It got as low as 19 in August.\\n\\nThe '",

Making money from selling CCs is a whole different ball game, and trading options is something else entirely.\r  \n\r  \nYou want to Wheel?  Step one is to own hundreds of shares of stocks that you plan on holding long term.  Step 2 is to sell CCs on them, collecting premium until you get assigned, then turning around and selling puts until you own the stocks again.  \r  \n\r  \nIf you want to actively make money from options and are not a degenerate gambler from WSB, you need to look at them differently.  You're looking for bullish option chains- ones where the market thinks they're gong up far enough that you can make enough money from selling premium that you're protected even if it goes down.  Last week I made 5.3% on AVYA even though it dropped 18.3%.  I got in Monday morning and sold Oct 21 $1.50 calls for $0.75.  On Friday those calls were worth $0.32, so I bought back in and sold my shares at $1.50, making $0.11 per share on a stock that dropped $.32 in that time.  This week I don't like any AVYA calls because no one is bullish enough to pay enough premium for me to feel safe holding the stock."

I know other put-sellers like this, but I also have to assume there are maybe some who actually want the stock.  For me, if I really wanted the stock, I would have bought it already.\n\nIt's the same for me with the call. If I'm long the stock, I don't really want to sell it, or else I would have sold it already.  I want to collect the premium and have the contract expire worthless. In most (but not all) cases I'll BTC the call rather than losing the stock.

     "Maybe try a calendar spread if you\u2019re bullish on apple and want to get a feel for options, you\u2019ll greatly reduce the amount of capital you risk (though realize they can be more challenging to manage). This would consist of buying the $130 calls and selling more near term $130 calls. \n\nThis trade creates sort of a pyramid shaped profit graph where the peak (max profit) is around the strike of the calls. The advantage is you pay less for the long calls by financing with the short calls. So if apple trades sideways you profit and if it goes down you lose less. The disadvantage is you stand to take a loss if apple were to run up greatly since the short term calls would gain value faster than your long term calls and you could be assigned if you don\u2019t manage the trade (though you are protected on the upside by the long call you hold). This trade is long theta as long as the share price stays nears the strikes. \n\nIf you have no idea what any of that means you probably should study options more before taking any trades. If I were you I\u2019d give it a try in a paper trading platform to see how both the naked long call and the bull calendar spread respond to changes in stock price over time."

These spreads will allow risk management and you won\u2019t have to worry about selling CC\u2019s on stocks you are holding long that may be below your cost basis. I am fond of SPY diagonal and calendar spreads myself but I trade CVS, BA and a few others that I have been following.

It's just as possible AAPL drops 5-10% after the split with the inevitable spike in volatility from more retail investors / day traders entering the market with their more accessible 100-dollar shares and even the tensions in the market in general. Sure, in the long run it will settle back down, but your expiration doesn't allow for that.\n\nThis could work, but you're taking a *very* risky play for under 20% ROI. Just seems like there are far better moves you could make if you're interested in selling covered calls or spreads."

  "Text": "b'**Background**\\n\\nMuch talk about the VIX has been boiled down to it being a fear gauge or some other vague notion of it being a volatility index. Both of these are correct, but lets get slightly deeper into what the VIX really is.\\n\\nIn sum, the VIX is the market saying Hey, theres a 68% probability that Ill go up or down by this value over the next year. I might be over or under shooting that value, but today, I say theres a 68% probability of that.\\n\\nSo, a VIX of $20 represents what the annual volatility estimate of the market is (20% up or down), with a probability of 68%.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mfbr7lxq3bl91.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb851655df86b2b7b5808d7fbfa8f4977985ba14\\n\\nThe derivation of the VIX takes in a strip of options, but we will use an easier method in our own calculation, so it isnt imperative we dive into the formulaic nuance of the VIX calculation(Methodology here: [https://cdn.cboe.com/api/global/us\\\\_indices/governance/Volatilit'",

     "No it does not, it depends on the motive and knowledge of the user as well as the setup. But the most important factor in this discussion is what is defined as gambling, because based on the definition even trading long term options or the underlying can be essentially gambling too. \n\nLike we have seen so many people buying crypto or stonks just because other people are buying or earning money from it, so that can be seen as gambling too.\n\nI think gambling have 3 components. \n\nFirstly, it is that the outcome is completely out of your control and it is based on random chance. Which this in itself is debatable as some would use this and argue that playing poker is not gambling and it is a skill based sports.\n\nSecondly, is that the probability of the outcome you want is either 50% or below; Or the expected value of the outcome is negative. So if you are betting on heads on a fair coin that will be gambling but if you are betting heads on a weighted coin that will show head 70% of the time, that won't be gambling. \n\nLastly, the user either do not have any knowledge of the first 2 points, or knows of the first 2 points but still choose to take action despite believing that the odds is not in their favor. \n\nSo with that we can easily classify whether any action is gambling or not (assuming you subscribe to this definition). \n\nSome example of person trading short option but is not gambling:\n\n1. A bad news was reported and the share price crashed hard caused by panic selling. You believe it is oversold, but are unsure if the panic selling is over, but based on historical records usually the share price will go back up a day or 2 later, so you bought a short term CALL option at current price. Which limits your downside but gives you exposure to the upside. \n2. Share price of the stock dropped to your entry price and you want to buy many of the shares, however your pay only come a few weeks later, or your capital takes time to liquidate and transfer over. You might buy a short term option while waiting for cash to come in.\n3. IV is to the roof, e.g. pharma stock with IV% > 1000 because of clinical trial reporting, and you sold a super deep OTM PUT option to profit from IV crush (after accounting for risk reward ratio).\n4. You have asymmetric information due to your work, and you know of some news that is going to be release that will affect share price, so you bought tons of short term options to gain insane amount of leverage without using margin. \n5. You are selling PUT options at the intended entry price you want to buy the shares at (assuming you did deep research on the stock), so you sell short term PUT options on it to benefit from tetha decay and free premium. \n\nAnd many many more. But the same options mentioned above can also be gambling if it the motive of the user is not the same. E.g. for point 5 selling PUT options just because premium is high and they just want the premium but they don't know anything about the company at all. So yea"

Probably down to the $80-$90 range.   That gets expensive fast.\n\nI would say the spread width criteria is the more important of the two, so try to meet that at least."

     "> 1)I buy apple leap call for $1000 and then I sell it a few days later for $900.\n\nNitpick: Why are you using a far expiration in the first place if you are going to unload it a few days later?\n\n> I then buy it back for $950 and sell it for $1050. \n\nYou mean \"buy another one with identical strike and expiration\". You can't buy back the same contract you closed.\n\n> I've made no net profit in this trade, but how does this affect the wash sale rule? \n\nYou need to break it down one step at a time. Don't jump to the bottom line of the P/L, that's how you  make mistakes.\n\nI find it useful to journal the P/L of each individual trade, with open and close dates, to see what the tax implications are.\n\nOct 1: BTO AAPL $100c for $10.00\n\nOct 4: STC AAPL $100c for $9.00. Realize a $1/share loss.\n\nOct 5 (within 30 days of the loss): BTO AAPL $100c for $9.50. This turns the Oct 4 trade into a wash sale and the $1/share loss is added to the cost basis of this trade. So your net BTO cost on this trade is adjusted to $10.50/share.\n\nOct 7: STC AAPL $100c for $10.50. Since your adjusted cost basis is $10.50, you net neither a gain nor loss, so ultimately no taxes are applied nor deducted against any of the trades in this series.\n\nNet tax impact: zero.\n\n\n> 2) I buy apple leap call for $1000 and then sell it for $900.

If they do, work through the journal as per (1) to determine tax consequences. If not, there is no wash sale and everything is normal taxation of P/L.\n\nIn general, as long as the washing trade (the trade whose cost basis was increased by the washed loss) is closed in the same tax year, the net tax impact is zero.\n\n> 3)I've also been doing spreads on spy basically every other day and sometimes they expire worthless for profit but sometimes I close them for a substantial loss. How does this affect the wash sale?\n\nUnless the spreads are substantially identical, there won't be any wash sales. If there are wash sales, as long as you close the washing trade in the same tax year, the net tax impact is zero."

SPX options are section 1256 contracts. Not subject to the wash sale rules. Even though some people complain about it (because some brokers pass through additional fees on each option), it is much easier (from a tax standpoint).\n\nFor AAPL and other securities you have losses in, it would be best for you to stop trading those securities (and options on those securities) on November 29, 2022. This gets you that 30 day window and breaks the chain for wash sales. If you really want to trade in December, trade section 1256 contracts. Then you will be in compliance with IRS regulations."

If you buy, sell at a loss and then buy the same expry and sell at a gain.

That way you throw away extrinsic value, but you get the dividend instead. \n\nIt's worth mentioning that If your call was ITM, and extrinsic value is less than the dividend, you might also consider selling your call and repurchasing shares instead, if you can get some extrinsic value out of it, after considering any tax implications. You don't need to worry about that, since your call is not ITM in the first place.\n\nMore info on that here: [http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/2014/12/15/exercising-long-in-the-money-options-to-collect-dividend](http://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/2014/12/15/exercising-long-in-the-money-options-to-collect-dividend)"

It is exactly the same risk profile as selling a Deep ITM put. \n\nIt might feel like you've lost money as the call you sold is now ITM but in reality, you've made money because your Stock has rallied very well.

The stock currently trades at 219.46, which is **8.9% higher** than the close following its last reported earnings, trading with a range of 197.31 to 233.47 since that time.\\n\\n### Expected Price Volatility\\n\\nCurrently, option traders are expecting a ** 5.0%** move for this earnings, and during the previous earnings release, the stock experienced a **+5.9%** move. Over the last 12 quarters, the absolute average move has been ** 4.5%**, with a minimum move of 0.3% and a maximum move of 6.6%. AAPL has experienced **7** larger-than-expected earnings moves in the last 12 quarters. '",

My question (as a someone relatively new to options) is: \\n\\nIf I'm selling puts on a relatively stable underlying like SPY, QQQ, APPL, etc. what's the downside to keep rolling out in line with the trend (i.e. roll out and down when the stock is declining, or out and up if it's increasing) as long as I'm making decent credit along the way? \\n\\nSince I haven't been assigned, there's no real cost basis yet that I have to worry about managing. The only real risk that I see is a black swan event where the underlying drops too far too fast to keep the puts in a decently profitable range. \\n\\nI could very well be wrong, but it seems like a relatively safe way to keep making a bit of money rather than park everything in cash as some have suggested during these turbulent times.\"",

     "The problem that I personally have when I see people discussing rolling is they act as though it is some magic method to avoid taking a loss on a trade. That is faulty thinking.\n\nWhen you roll you are closing one trade and immediately opening a new one. They are not the same trade, they are different trades that you happen to execute in the same step.\n\nTherefore, if you have a trade that you would have to take a loss to close, and you roll it, you are not avoiding the loss at all. You are taking the loss and then opening a new trade. The fact that the premium you receive from the new trade covers the cost of closing the old trade is immaterial.\n\nI think this is a very important concept to understand.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with rolling at all. You can use it to keep pulling premium from a winning trade idea, and you can use it to help offset the cost of a losing trade idea if you believe that it's going to go your way. However, the concept that you can just keep rolling a loser forever to avoid taking the loss is foolish. It might work for awhile but it will eventually come back to bite you.\n\nPersonally I don't like to roll when things aren't going my way. I prefer to exit my losing position and either move on to something else or wait for conditions to change before re-entering."

If you really are this bullish on Apple and want to trade something with a similar premium but much lower breakeven I'd suggest trading a debit spread. For example, if you buy the the 180 strike and sell the 195 strike, you pay a net premium of $187, but your breakeven would be $181.85. This means that you would only need Apple to go up around 34.5% vs the 86% required to make money by buying just the 250 strike exp 1/2022."

You've already failed if the stock is going straight up or straight down.\n\nIC wants a range-bound price trend. Where are going to find range-bound price trends in this market that have IVR > 50%?\n\n> Looking for a credit that is 25% the defined max risk. Thus you make $1000 credit for possible $4000 lost\n\nThat's a shitty 4/1 risk/reward ratio. One loss wipes out four previous gains. You should try for 2/1 or better, which incidentally keeps your wingspans narrow, reducing pin risk.\n\n> Next I am doing this on a weekly basis with 4 different underlying and thus would have some diversification\n\nYou're not going to find one underlying with that profile, let alone four. AAPL is not range-bound. It's week-over-week trend is down, just like the rest of the market.\n\n> I also plan on taking these to expirations due to having wide wings.\n\nsmh, you must love pin risk.\n\n> The win rate for all these plays would be a delta between 70-80%\n\nHuh? Do you mean delta between 20-30 giving you a win rate of 70-80%? That's nuts. You can't do win rate like that for an IC, because too many of the win states for one wing are max loss on the other wing.\n\n> Also for each of these if any of them started to breach one of the spreads I would have a rule to exit for 2x the credit.\n\nOkay, 2/1 is better than 4/1 risk/reward at least.\n\n\n> May 27 expiration 146/145 Calls 129/128 Puts 50 contracts on each\n\nHuh? Where is your $4000 max loss vs. $1000 credit? Those wingspans are only $1 wide. I'm confused. Your max loss/credit numbers imply $50 wide wingspans.\n\nYou want to trade **50 ICs** x 4 underlyings every week? You have enough cash to cover the collateral on all that?  $50-wide wingspans x 100 x 50 x 4 = $1 million per week.\n\nIf you have that kind of money, you ought to be doing something more like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ulvsck/theta_without_delta_intro_to_vol_trading/).

     "You are selling around a 30 delta in both sides so that means you start with about a 70% chance of it staying in between those strikes.  \n\nThe good news is that you\u2019re getting a lot of room for 30 delta.  If you want to see how much more, model this trade next week and compare the difference in width.  I bet it\u2019s narrower.  The bad news is the reason you are getting a lot of room is that volatility is high due to earnings.\n\nYou open this trade as a net credit so you are, effectively, selling the IC.  That means you want the value of it to go down since you would buy it back to close it.  So it is correct to say that if the value of the spread goes up, you lose money since you would end up paying more than you received to close it.\n\nEarnings plays are spec plays.  Nothing wrong with that but keep them small.  If you are wrong, plan for a max loss, which will be about $100 or so per IC.  The dollar risk/reward ratio here isn\u2019t bad for an IC, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s earnings and the real risk can be deceiving.  And since you are only 4 days to expiration, there isn\u2019t much to do with trade if it doesn\u2018t work.\n\nHope this helps."

     "I think you\u2019re confusing covered calls and cash secured puts. You have to have the cash ready to buy 7 contracts worth of AAPL, unless you\u2019re selling them naked, not hold the underlying. If you have the cash to do both then great you have a very bullish position, but that wasn\u2019t clear from the post so I\u2019m just clarifying. Tying up $105,000 for 2 years just to make $24,000 is pretty much standard market return on two average years, except you\u2019re taking on more risk as if the market shits itself from today and Jan 20 2023 you\u2019re gonna end up losing money for 2 years worth of work. Same cash problem applies to selling weeklies except with that you will get assigned at some point. Now that isn\u2019t too bad as it just means you get to hold Apple and you can turn around and sell covered calls on it and make premium until it\u2019s sold (at above your cost basis) and make some solid weekly income. Personally I\u2019d go with the short option just because there is more I can control there and it doesn\u2019t require me tying up my funds for far too long for my purposes."

It's extremely expensive and operationally intensive, but it gives you the true arb on the implied corr.\n\nThe other benefit of buying components is you can hold to expiration. If you just short the index vol, you're relying on the market correcting this abnormally high corr. But if the market never corrects, then the only way to recognize your vision is to realize the implied vols.\n\nLastly, do you have a screener to track all implied corr? If yes, could you do a correlation relative value trade? where you buy low correlation percentile indices and sell high correlation?"

Couple of clarifying Qs:\n\n1) Your friends who decreased PnL through delta hedging: was this mostly down to transaction costs or was the realized volatility in the period they held the trade high enough to eat into PnL?  \n\n2) \"With this trade structure, I was leaning slightly positive delta. I had **very little theta** or gamma, and a LOT of vega. Basically, as long as the stock didn't trend to hard in one direction, I had a pretty linear trade.\"\n\nI think I answered my own question after writing this :) You would have benefitted from theta but I'm guessing in relation to your vega, it was relatively small.\n\n3) Did you consider some form of calendar spread (i.e. perhaps the dislocation of 1y IV meant that eg 60d IV was underpriced on a relative basis)?

They are extremely straightforward and serve a very useful purpose. That intended purpose looks like this: 1) an investor owns the stock 2) they\\'d be willing to sell it higher. 3) If they sell OTM calls they have the chance to lower their cost basis before eventually being called away in the stock. 4) IOW, for those wanting to sell stock higher, a covered call strategy is a lot smarter than a GTC sell order in the stock.\\n\\nWhere covered calls get misused (IMHO) is as income generation against long stock.

You get less premium, you pay higher fees (4 legs instead of 1) and you still have no downside protection of the stock drops.  Actually, you increase your risk because if the short put is ITM at expiration but the long put isn't (pin risk) you wind up being assigned (buying) another 100 shares of stock.\n\nAnother thing against your argument, is that by selling just the CC, if that large move takes place you could buy the CC back, or you could buy 100 shares to replace the ones being called away.\nAnd unless there is a huge, monster gap up, you very likely could buy back the CC or buy 100 shares before the price ever gets to 140.\nYour sold call spread is essentially a 120 CC and the purchase of 100 shares at 140.\n\nLastly, selling the CC and selling either a csp or a put spread would bring in that additional premium, and result in a higher gain than the ic you proposed."

     "I run covered calls on almost everything I own. The thing posters of these types of posts forget is that you can almost always roll the call forward at or near expiration, and you will always receive more credit premium in the roll.\nSometimes I am able to roll it forward, AND upward by $0.50 or $1 or more depending on the volatility of the options and how pricey the weeks or months ahead options are.\n\nI ran into this a month ago with NIO. I bought on the dip, but then sold $35 calls to generate income. When it shot up before the end of the day I decided to roll that call a week forward by a $1 upwards, and keep the shares. I eventually sold the shares much higher than that original call price, but kept rolling the calls until it turned a profit. In almost exactly a month, I was able to roll the call strike all the way up to $40 without losing any shares on the way, and added a great deal to the bottom line.\nThe shares I had sold at $38, and the calls today expired worthless because they never got to $40.\nI agree with statements in principle that if you're 100% bullish then you don't sell covered calls, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how bullish YOU are on a stock, it still moves around, up and down, sometimes sideways. Profiting off the time element of options is profit pure and simple. Sure, you have to manage it, but its not bearish to use CCs in my opinion."

     "Covered call is bullish with downside protection. If you're betting on the stock moving outside 1 weekly/monthly std, that's a losing bet. \n\nNow LEAPS are another story. \n\nOwning the stock and selling a credit spread could be seen as a bullish/neutral strategy.\n\nYou're subject to more severe losses if the stock goes down outside of the strikes. Also depending on how wide your wings are, the losses can be very, very, very severe.\n\nI still remember on the stock sub how a guy posted about owing his broker 180k because he had sold a wide iron condor before linkedin earnings and they had tanked to 100 bucks. He stood to make something like 10-15k at the time but he got eviscerated. \n\nLet's be honest here, you're talking about opportunity cost when you discuss 'losses' on a cc from the upside, but losses on an iron condor and butterfly are very real and very much not in the form of potential gains you cut yourself off from.\n\nI would say the safest out of all these are selling cash secured puts.\n\nFor me, the appeal of the iron condor, or trading any spread lies in its ability to provide an enormous amount of leverage and the insane amount of premium you can collect when iv is very high, but saying iron condors are a 'better' strategy seems really misleading, implying they're less risk, more reward, higher chance of success and such. So much more goes into it.\n\nLess risky than a cc I'd say is a Pmcc which there was a great post someone made here earlier on that strategy.\n\nWhy is pmcc not recommended by you recommend iron condor + hold?\n\nYou could argue pmcc does the same thing but with significantly less downside risk."

     "In general, a covered call should be used for short- and mid-term bullish plays, with the call set at the point where you'd be happy to sell because you'd consider it overvalued or overbought. AAPL is in a good spot for that if you're a technical analysis sort of person: buy it now, set your covered call to 145, the 52-week high and where 14-day RSI is at 80%. If it gets there, hooray! You didn't want the shares anyway, you expect it to go down, and you just got the maximum profit available.\n\nIf you're in AAPL for the long haul, ownership + credit/short iron condor is more bullish than a Covered Call, but part of why is because it doesn't hedge against bearish surprises. \n\nIn your example, a decline to $115 produces: \n\n* $1,320 loss for 100 shares @ 130 plus covered call @ 140\n* $1,848 loss for 100 shares\\* @ 130 plus short iron condor 115/120/140/145\n\n*\\* One nice thing about iron condors is that you don't need coverage for them at all, so you can own any number of shares here, including zero.*\n\nObviously, a person who is bullish does not expect a bearish surprise. But it's still a risk. A covered call limits max profit with a bullish surprise, but it also hedges against all forms of bear movement. Ownership + short iron corridor hedges against normal bear movements, but it magnifies losses from a bearish surprise.\n\nPersonally, I think you're right about AAPL at the moment, and the better play here is the iron condor. But the investor needs to factor in their expectation of, and tolerance for, the risk of a bearish surprise."

     "Covered call is best seen as measure to lock in your profits and is something you can do over and over again irrespective of the price. Its a defensive and prudent strategy which generally works well when you intend to hold the actual stock. Also high beta stocks are obviously more rewarding given the high implied volatility in the calls one sells.\n\nA debit call spread would invariably be better as a short term bullish strategy.  \n\nTheres one caveat with iron condors on stocks, they underlying say for instance AAPL may have a significant move in either one direction and would wipe out the previous gains, unless one is quick to make adjustments. IMO, Iron condors are better with indices and despite lower IV, because you are unlikely to lose in a covered call if you intend to hold the stock for say 5 years but iron condors actually can leave you in loss if a high beta stock goes either way, of course the loss will still be capped and known to you beforehand. \n\nTLDR: Covered call would cut you off your profit at the worst and iron condors would give you a predetermined loss at worst."

What is missing here is that you sell your calls out 1 month. If it gets in the money you simply roll out another month and collect EVEN MORE PREMIUM. You might be thinking how is that possible? IV is the answer. When IV goes up ALL the call prices go up and since a call premium is really just buying \u201ctime\u201d that same \u201ctime\u201d value is equally stupid high every month you go out. No stock goes up forever. I did this on MP materials for example which I plan to hold for years to come. Started selling covered calls on it for about 3 months now and my average share cost is down around 5 bucks/share. Its actually easier than most people think to do this, but for some reason people are one dimensional and get froze in the headlights when their call gets in the money the only thing preventing them from rolling up and out is greed they will keep the entire premium"

     "WTF? a Covered call is a bullish play? Not at all. \n\nLets be clear here about what I am saying. \n\nA Covered Call, is a Bearish Play. After all your expectation is the stock will end below the strike price you are selling for. \n\nThat your call is covered does not change selling calls from Bear to Bull, you have simply hedged the risk that the stock will runaway leaving you with massive losses.\n\nI disagree with the author that an Iron Condor is a better play, because it requires more legs, has risk on both sides of the trade and is suitable for stocks that won't wander out of the range. Vertical Spread better represents recapture of most the profits should the stock catapult past your strike significantly.  \n\nTo reduce losses to theta the higher strike call should be done further out in time, and rolled forwards to be no closer than two weeks where theta really begins eating larger chunks on a daily basis.  You then sell the weeklies, near the money where theta loss should be highest and profits greatest because of the potential for being ITM. \n\nIf you feel the need to protect against loss you can buy Puts, but there is little point to doing so unless there is a high risk of falling, why? Because if the stock is falling, the value of the covered call is acting like a makeshift put. If it falls enough you can close that position and open a new one closer to ITM to continue capturing money on the way down.\n\nIf you so mistrust your stock that you need two levels of puts (selling one strike and buying another) I would suggest you are in this case either overly risk adverse or you don't trust the stock you are in to retain its value, which is another matter. \n\nAny drop in value if you are a long term holder, will be covered by the income generation of selling the covered calls, and should they be called away on a large move you have the purchased calls to ensure that you are not out too much. \n\nJust one man's opinion. I like Iron Condors, but I think they are for stocks with small volatility, which already means limited income generation for the risk of being called away in the first place."

One of the reasons I write CC's is that I own the asset (underlying) and if the CC moves against me, I still own the asset and that safety is worth something (for me). This is only really important if you're writing calls on rock solid companies. If a spread or IC moves against me I can try and manage the trade but that still may not always work in my favor.

     "This is an interesting point. I appreciate the time you took to help educate others. \n\n\nTwo points I want to bring up that to hope will help the both of us (and others) continue to learn. Keep in mind I am not questioning your knowledge, but will be trying my best to write this in a manner others can follow. \n\n1) This does seem to be the better play for a bullish outlook (as you stated.) But, it does seem to increase your potential losses. Where as a CC can be closed early and repositioned in down trends to increase premium. \n\nNow that is not to say CC is still the optimal trade here. Just a consideration for people to take in. \n\n2) You mentioned assignment of a CC caps profits (and it does). But if you want to get back into the position, you could wait for a small dip and sell a shorter expiry ITM CSP (in the money cash secured put).\n\nIf it continues to moon, you collect a thick premium. If you are assigned, the premium will help further lower your cost basis and restart the cycle. \n\n\n- there is obviously no best method that works in every scenario. But just some food for thought for the poster and any on-lookers."

     "I'll share a recent example of where covered calls helped me out, feel free to give feedback or ask questions.\n\nI was long about $200k worth of Goldman Sachs with a long-term horizon, had bought in at just below the high (around $344-ish).  The stock retreated back to the $330 range and traded as low as $318. This could be due to yields, or Archegos, or just a normal correction. I was down, and my normal strategy would be to ride it out and wait for it to come back up.  I knew earnings are due on 4/20, and confident the price would recover in Q2.\n\nBut I wondered if I could speed that up.   Noting that the stock was stuck in a new sideways pattern between $320-330, I also noticed that calls for this stock were fetching very good prices, even in the 2-4 week range. This was likely because of the recent runup which had now run out of gas.\n\nRule 1: When a stock's volatility suddenly decreases, i.e., it takes a rest, there's a few week period where options are overpriced. \n\nI sold covered calls (4/16 expiry) at 335 strike against part of my long position while the stock was trading around 330, collecting around $4500 in premium.\n\nAt the same time, I also sold off some of my long shares at 330 and bought them back same day in the low $320s, lowering my basis.  The stock has refused to go much higher, but there is a decent intra-day volatility between $320-330.  My new basis is now below $335 on the total position. \n\nRule 2:  Get paid while you wait for something you expect to happen, to happen.\n\n Today GS closed around $331. It's starting to come back. The covered call has increased in value of course (hope its one of you lucky bastards).  If the price gets to $335 I'll get exercised, but I'll be ahead by about $10k when that happens.   Then I'll buy back in and start all over again."

     "You have an interesting idea, but I don't think your strategy is correct. A covered call is specifically used to lower cost basis to collect premium without requiring any more capital. Doing an iron condor adds cost to your shares. This is a big factor in why you do a covered call because it does not add capital requirements. \n\nNext, iron condors are specific to being neutral on a stock. A covered call can be seen as a bearish-neutral trade. Iron condors can end up losing you money if it trades outside the wings past breakeven, thus giving you a loss in any direction. Which leads to the next point: the covered call overall makes you money no matter what direction it goes (the max profit is only capped).\n\nYou also forgot to mention the possibility of rolling the covered call hedge up and/or out to collect even more premium. This is options management 101. You don't need to buy it back and take a loss.\n\nThe next BIG thing is, why the hell would you do an iron condor on a stock just because you own it? Owning the underlying doesn't affect the iron condor. You're better off using that capital on a stock you found that fits short option strategies (high liquidity, high IV, neutral assumption, etc.).\n\nSummary:\n\n* CC: hedge, win-win up or down, requires no extra capital, can manage/roll\n\n* IC: for profit taking, requires capital, neutral trade and loses when outside breakevens, requires option strategies, can't roll well, underlying stock doesn't help to own it"

Well I am done, I will make this one last final message, point to this excellent update and rest.\n\nYes because you have the shares you are bullish on the stock, but the act of the short call is bearish on PRICE.\n\nThough I am curious how is 10 covered calls on 1000 shares only 5 synthetic puts and 5 calls rather than being 10 synthetic puts? I thought it was one sold call plus 100 stock (hedge) was a synthetic put.\n\n[https://investingwithoptions.com/covered-call/](https://investingwithoptions.com/covered-call/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n \n\nYou shiould trade covered calls if you are bullish on the stock and  bearish on the volatility, and don't mind having similar risk as if you  were just long stock.\n\n### Why You\u00a0Don't Trade Covered Calls\n\nIf you think the stock is due for a huge move, you shouldn't trade  covered calls. This is both to the upside and downside. If the stock is  about to crash, then you don't need the large downside exposure-- and if  the stock is about to rip higher, you don't want to cap your gains.\n\nCovered calls are a bearish volatility strategy. If you are bullish  volatility, then you need to choose a different option trade.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\nFor the benefit of everyone arguing with me. See the above, which is what I have repeated ad nauseum. Rather than call me uneducated maybe you should ask yourself how much you do or do not actually know, and go read some \"internets\" like the above before arguing with me. Anyone arguing with what I said at this point will be pointed to this page the first time, and blocked the next time."

You think the stock is going to go up long-term but short-term either the market or the individual stock is going sideways between now and expiration.\n2. If the stock does go up, it is not the end of the world because you can do a diagonal roll to a later date and higher strike price.  Probably best to do that as soon as you see it going ITM so its not too expensive to cover, and you may even have a net gain when you roll.\n3. If you are trading in an IRA you may be limited on the options level and not have a choice but to use covered calls."

And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesnt approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. \\n\\nSo be prepared because this is the outline of whats going to ensue when it happens: \\n\\nShorts, who are getting fucked inside'",

     "So, a few things to clarify here. TLDR - there is no set date for the stock offering, and the offering will turn GME even more bullish\n\nA new stock offering was already discussed in the last earnings call, it's already on the table, and I think (I have to check) that the S-3 is already submitted. This already caused a dip at that time (go figure). Main point here is that the shelf offering is restricted to USD 100 M. \n\nFirst, by current values this will be peanuts, even if they were to do the offering NOW.  It's a mere half a million shares.\n\nSecond point, doing this would have them wipe out 20% of the total debt they have. Even more if they negotiate. This is extremely bullish in my opinion. Most times, yes, a dilution makes the stock drop a bit. But look at TSLA and their recent offerings. The stock didn't take a hit. It jumped up even.\n\nAnd third, I highly doubt they will do this so soon. So far management has kept totally mum about what is happening, and rightly so. Next earnings call is early March and I believe they will keep their mouths shut until then. Smart. And plenty of time for the stock to rise which will mean even less shares.\n\nOf course, I do expect news on that day, very possibly a bigger offering that allows them to completely wipe out debt. And maybe (hopefully!) news of some interesting game streaming / game distribution platform. I'm extremely bullish\n\nDisclaimer: My opinion only. Not financial advice. I hold long position in GME, long calls and short puts"

Their message is, *\"Please stick around until I pull out of my position. Take a huge loss as a I walk away from my million dollar pyramid scheme payout. I promise one day the stock will bounce back again. Also, anyone who contradicts what we say is the enemy, don't listen to them.\"*\n\nPlaying on people's FOMO. But it's worse than that. Actively encouraging people not to sell after dilution and lying about the fundamentals of a company whose stock was worth $2 a month ago. At that point you can't help but get a little heated.\n\nGME is a dying company. They're closing stores nationwide. They're taking huge losses every quarter. Retail is dying, and gaming retail at an even more accelerating rate than the rest of the category. Gamers are buying video games online. GME will die in the same way blockbuster died. One quick look at the fundamentals of the company and the absurdity of this whole thing is revealed. There is no world in which GME maintains a market cap of 25 billion post correction. We would have to be living in a different universe.\n\nI'm happy for all those who bought the stock for what its worth and stand to make an unprecedented gain.

     "I agree. I obviously hold long dated puts in GME, which btw are in profit. This shows demand/volume for Puts is very high and of course the IV play. However, this is exactly the move we should see GME do. I bought calls with Tesla, they took on $5bn in cash and the price went up 20% because it eliminated bankruptcy risk due to poor cash flow (something the shorter were betting on) with GME I think they will seek to raise $1bn and they will get it. Eliminate all debt and have $400m to invest in the online e-commerce unite. And they hold $600m in property they could do a sale and leaseback etc to bring more cash to the table. \n\nIm looking for $800 call options from CBOE which I will buy, while still of course holding the longer term puts.\n\nI will not add rocket ships but this is hitting new highs if the management can ride such a retail investor wave up and raise the necessary cash. If the stock completely collapses on a raise I will buy physical shares. \n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, merely an opinion on unknown market events.

     " \n\n# ***Listen up! This is important. GME owners read this!! *****\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSo there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.\n\nGME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.\n\nThey want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.\n\nIf you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.\n\nDiamond hands. Buy every dip.\n\nThey are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*Don't listen to anything I say.

Given that for about 1/3 of the cost of 100 shares of SPY you can buy a LEAP (call) with expiration 3 years into the future with delta .80. Using the strategy of whenever you need cash, you convert 100 shares of SPY into options in this manner, (buy option that moves similarly to SPY us cash for living) it seems like you maintain a similar exposure to the stock market (.8x500k=400k) while having approximately 1M in cash to live off of. It seems like this would also have the benefit of some downside protection as options deep in the money move less and less with stock price as stock goes down. What am I missing here?  This seems like a sustainable approach barring a 30-40 percent stock crash. Has anyone done this or are there any risks Im not considering?'",

Leap position is a loser v shares, missing out on the dividends and some theta decay.\n\nMarket is flat. Again leaps are a loser v shares. Market is down 5 percent. Same deal, leaps are the loser.\n\nWhile it may be fun to think about extreme moves, the middle part of the probability curve is centered near the current price.\n\nThe analogy might be rolling two dice like in craps.

Am I getting to far ahead of myself with going straight into options without having been a stock trader before? As far as I understand it, if approached correctly it can be a much safer and diverse way (albeit lower %gain) than stock trading since theres so many methods to hedge or to gain in neutral or bearish market. Am I correct in this assession? Also since you said it's so different to stocks anyways, I think I'll try to learn by selling options."

I'm trying to learn as much of the fundamentals as possible so I don't make the mistake of above mentioned ever again.\n\nI'll check out tasty's vid and learn what is offered there (I'm assuming a quick search on Google will help with finding the videos?).\n\nI have a portfolio on E-Trade with $3500 to start with (10% of my liquid portfolio). I have long investments <250k that is managed through a financial advisor.

     "> If you normally are simply long S&P500 index funds, for example, now you can be long DITM calls on that same fund, but take the other 50% of your capital (estimating) and gain another 2+% on interest bearing instruments. If the S&P gains 10% over the year, you're getting 11% (10% + 1/2 of the 2% interest since only 50% of your money is in the bond). It's the simplest, easiest way to beat the market every single year. You just need to make sure you roll your calls forward before expiration. \n\nI'm surprised I've never heard of this in the conservative investing subs. Just learning about options myself.  As there's no such thing as a free lunch, I suppose you're taking on extra risk. I'm trying to think through what that might be. I guess the economics on the call can become unfavorable if the market drops too much (i.e., it's no longer deep in the money, or even in the money). \n\nYou're not getting dividends, which I assume is priced in, and may be an advantage for long-term investors trying to avoid taxes. On the other hand, Googling leads me to believe rolling the call forward is a taxable event, so you're marking to market any gains and also resetting the long-term capital gains clock, which seems terrible and basically makes this strategy not worth considering except in a tax-advantaged account?\n\nYou're also paying to execute option trades at most brokerages, while trades in underlying are free now."

I would add Blackswan by Taleb. \nOptions can not be traded like stocks, but often can be combined with the underlying to gain exposure to a position in a way that would otherwise be impossible. \nAlthough I just recently started posting on the sub, I am not new to the game.  When it comes to buying options, I generally buy puts on an ETF for a market cap weighted sector index (mostly energy) to act as a hedge for the exposure in the form of calls, futures, warrants or common shares or occasionally preferred shares. \nInsider information is absolutely a no-go, but gaining an edge through careful research and having a superior network of knowledgeable professionals in the industry essential to making well informed investments with a longer time horizon than a few days. Writing naked calls or puts is not something I would ever do, however, I do believe limiting yourself to buying or writing, call or puts is a mistake. Know how much capital you have at risk. Plan for the worst. Great post. Thanks for sharing this witch everyone."

Somebody else had the same idea and people were deterring them due to   losses piling up with \u201ctime decay\u201c.\n\nIf the market slips into bear territory and i exercise a call on that total market short fund because the price skyrocketed, how does time-decay come into focus? Isn't that only an issue if you *sell* your calls?\n\nAnd if the bear market takes hold, i can exercise my call option at any point prior to the expiration?

You can lower your entry price or at least make money waiting for it to drop. You don't, however, get the benefit nor the risk of leverage. Also, if it really craters, you can get stuck owning it at a higher price than you would like.\n\nFYI - I think options trading (and active trading in general) is a waste of time unless you're really good, which is a few percent of the population. Much easier to ignore all the volatility and time decay and just buy stocks and hold over the long term, especially in a bull market.

     "Great post. One question/comment: it\u2019s my understanding that the buyer of deep ITM calls pays for the embedded leverage those calls provide. The changes in the price of the option relative to interest rates is incapsulated by rho. It\u2019s the same in the futures space, in that the long is paying for the embedded leverage as a carrying cost. This would mean that the interest rate arbitrage you suggest would not be possible. But, options and futures do provide some of the cheapest leverage out there, especially compared to typical margin lending. I don\u2019t think the MM selling you the deep ITM call wants to bleed money on the working capital tied up in the hedge they hold. Another comment on the deep ITM call purchasing: you tend to pay a decent amount for liquidity out there, and you pay steep IV given the fat tails that MM price that far away from the current value of the underlying. Obviously, this is an options subreddit, but I generally think futures are a better tool for someone who is actually looking for cheap leverage.\n\nI would be very interested in discussion if you disagree with any of the above.

I plan to sell my two options on AAPL for the $5 profit and sell CC puts in SPAC companies I like.   \n\n\nMy highlights from your article:  \n\n\n1.  More than anything else, most options trader are trading volatility changes.\n2. Second only to volatility, most options are trading time.\n3. Generally, the buyers of options contracts are net losers.\n4. Generally, the sellers of options contracts are net winners.\n5. KELLY CRITERION, that I heard of first in your post. Use only 1/2 Kelly due to lack of firm percentages. (I must work on this in selling CC puts)\n6. Now to read up on \"Market Wizard\" and \"New Market Wizards\" and what does DITM mean?\n\nIt is easier to critique a post than to create a good post. This forum on options is outstanding in expertise. You rule. Thanks for writing this."

     "Just saved this too, I amm not gonna lie i am definitely new to options and want to focus on that this year. I have all my money tied up investments and now want to explore this other facet of the market. I am engineer by trade but I do want to learn this. I agree that its wreckless to just jump in, as with anything worthwhile. However I also want to capitalize on the volatility around earnings season and I am spending a good amount of time researching, anxiously waiting to place my first option. I struggle because I dont have anyone to ask questions to, (any chance you offering mentorship ? lol ) but I also cant spend years trying to understand this only to make a few dollars (I dont see myself being a $$$ big options player ever lol). I saw options as a way to reinforce the strategy around my portfolio, all the industries/companies I have invested in because I expect them to do well in the coming years.  So I figured I can secure long calls to keep the momentum, and secure quality deals on the companies I already invest in. But reading some of your responses below... that doesnt like the right strategy?"

I read a tweet yesterday that sad when Tom Brady first started in the NFL interest rates were 6% and that was AFTER the dot com bust. \n\nCan you still justify putting your cash in interest bearing funds while interest rates are zero or near zero?

But I always risked money I didnt care if I lost.\n\nI ended up winning some, and losing some.  You can do paper trading to understand options which is what I recommend, just don't do it for too long as your money vs paper money is a lot different when applied. \n\nDefinitely learned a lot about delta, theta, and how IV can fuck you over.\n\nThat being said, with risk management, I do believe you can trade options like stocks, but stocks are almost always the better play. With options, you wanna get out fast after you get a amount you are happy with. For me that was 20%-30% depending on market sentiment. I would take out 80%, and leave the 20% to see if it went higher. Most of the time it didnt, and I lost the remaining 20%. \n\nRetrospectively, I would do options to start instead of stocks to build a decent amount of cash. Then invest in stocks as you build wealth.  Watch some videos on youtube, and make small plays, thats the way to learn. At the end, most people lose not because its a risky play, but because of emotional trading, fomo, and greed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy journey: Started with $5K CAD --> Options Winners: tlry , blnk, bynd, nio, gme\n\nOption losers: nok, gme, bb\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently sitting at $25K (around there): Invested long term into Cardano, ARBKF, TLRY, and IZEA"

Today, I saw that my stonk was rising and there were articles explaining its rise. So I decided to buy a single call ATM call option contract for $100 with an expiry date of 2/26. My strike price and break-even price was a difference of about 1.5%.\n\nMy option just jumped 45% 2 hours ago and has since leveled to about 30% gain ever since. Since I have about 2 weeks to expiry, I'm gonna watch this grow and see how it goes.\n\nI guess I got lucky."

     "So I have been in the stock game for a bit... strategy has worked quite well for me between picking winners and diversifying.   \n\nI understand options are a different beast, but I decided to dabble a bit and learn more with a small amount as well as using paper money on TOS.\n\nFrom your post and what I have been reading is that selling is where you will get a good net profit, but also a higher risk to lose more than your principle. I am correct in this understanding?\n\nAdditionally I am reading a lot about rolling your calls if you make a profit, since it seems best to take that profit with the assumption of time value decay.\n\nI currently have an option that is above the strike price and the expiry is in July.  It's a doubled and rather than be greedy and risk losing it I was planning on selling the call and/or rolling it out.  But I also have faith in the company.  Since options are on volatility I think my best bet would be to do the roll and if I really like the company purchase actual stock in the hopes it will go up while using the options strategy for short term gain.  However, if the expiry is so far out there is room for increase, but also chance that those will be lost. Do traders often wait when those expiry are so far out?\n\nAny clarification on my misunderstanding of concepts would be helpful."

     "New(ish) investor here.\n\nI may have made a mistake and wanted to know how badly I've messed up.\n\nI purchased a $5 contract put ($.05 premium)  on GME with an expiry on Feb 12, thinking that it will increase in value to sell said option without risking much before expiry.  I basically made the mistake of thinking of it like a stock, and learned that lesson.  I also learned that I need to understand options a whole hell of a lot better before I decide to purchase another.  It will not even be a consideration until I understand the greeks, but alas, that's not what this post is about.\n\nMy concern is regarding the exercising of the stock that is out-the-money.  It hit me that my put option for $5 ~~is likely going to be~~ has the potential to be exercised, meaning that the stock will be purchased at $60 (current price as an example) and sell the 100 to me at that price, with the option of selling at $5 (as you can see, I don't fully grasp it still, but recognize that I have a lot to learn).  I'm ok with the loss of the premium ($5) thinking that's all I'm risking, but I'm envisioning worst case scenario here.  I have been trying to sell ~~it~~ the option and even requested the ~~stock~~ option not be exercised.  What will be my worst case scenario?\n\nQuite frankly, I don't have the funds to exercise the option, and I just wanted to be sure I didn't bite off more than I can chew.  I can handle a $5 loss, but I'm not sure that's all I'm risking.\n\nEdit: Strike price is $5"

On the other hand, maybe I'm not understanding the risk of buying calls. If I buy one contract for a call and the call cost me $100, I only lose $100 if the call is out the money right? I don't lose anything more than that. To me it's like spending $100 on scratchers and not winning anything. You were mentally prepared to spend that $100 on the lottery tickets as you were prepared to lose $100 on your call expiring worthless. You don't have the same luxury with the puts, as your $100 cost could easily turn into like, $1000.\n\nNote, I know that you shouldn't invest in the stock market like a lottery, I'm just saying as a new trader that's how I equate the risk.

     "Wow bro his was one of the best posts I\u2019ve read so far just saved it. So I\u2019ve traded for a few months now and quickly graduated to options. I was enamored with the leverage I had to put in less money and make higher percentages. I\u2019ve lost some money but overall I\u2019ve done very well. Here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve only done well because I control the losses and I\u2019ve let my wins go wild. My problem is getting in late and selling early, how do I get or where what publications are useful to get info on companies. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve made my decisions on what to trade. It\u2019s been great so far but I want to get better, the goal is to create cash flow so I can start tapping the money and live off it. Any advice would be much appreciated thanks for this post"

Nothing else is even close to being as comparable.\n\n> FWIW I am never looking to sell OTM puts with the idea of getting the stock at a cheaper level. In fact, I would never like that to happen. \n\nYay!\n\n> I sell options for the sole intent of them expiring worthless.\n\nBoo! You started out so great, but ended down bad.\n\nI've traded hundreds of short puts, exclusive of Wheel trades. I've never had a single one assigned. I've also never held one to expiration, or even within a week of expiration. That is not a coincidence. The closer you hold towards expiration, the greater the risk of assignment.\n\nWhy are you holding to expiration? Let me guess, \"Because that's how you get max profit!\" Right? But max profit comes with max risk.\n\nWould you rather exit early and collect $.50 per trade with 0% chance of assignment, or hold all the way to expiration and get $1.00 per trade, but risk a 20% chance of assignment? Also, if you exit early, *you can do more trades per year*. Which is better, do 12 trades per year held to expiration and make $1.00 per trade, or do 26 trades per year by exiting early and make $.50 per trade?"

     "I will tell you all the best and easiest trading strategy to build wealth. This is a strategy that only 0.1% of all WSB use, it\u2019s very rare in the autist community. \n1. Find good companies with strong moats and strong leadership - buying back stock is also something I would look for (AMD, Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Salesforce, Meta, VTI)\n2. Buy shares with all your disposable income for the next decade. Try and buy on dips when possible. Don\u2019t be Cathie wood. Only buy with money you don\u2019t need for 10x years. \n3. Don\u2019t waste time staring at your account. Check in every now and then but don\u2019t do anything. Just buy dips when you can. And re-invest all dividends. \n4. Focus your time on work and creating value for yourself. Don\u2019t waste time trying to time the market or dwelling on paper losses or gains. \n5. In 10x years, your account will have tripled (at least) and you can start taking some off the top to buy shares in up and coming great companies. Hold those, don\u2019t sell, and check it again it 10 years. Rinse and repeat. \n\nNever buy options. Don\u2019t panic and sell. Just add and hold, has worked for the last 100 years and will work for the next 100 years unless there is a nuclear war and if that happens who cares, we are all fucked."

Be advised that just because AAPL sank after last quarter's stellar blow-out earnings, historically there is a 50-50 chance it will go up or down after excellent earnings reports. It might even remain flat after earnings and make it a non-event. So just decide if you are a long, medium or short term holder (I recommend longterm because it should get over $200) and remember that any sharp sell-off is a buying opportunity.  I myself have 50,000 shares i am not touching and 5,000 extra swing trade shares I might sell above 155, but even if I do that I might try to buy them back if there is another big sell-off.

Earnings are likely to surprise to the upside and so that ought to be enough to spike us into the 150's.  However if this happens prior to earning then trimming whatever you don't want to hold longterm is an option. Not that 150's is the top, but I always trim a little of any stock after  big run just to be on the safe side. However we are not there yet. 144 is still a bit undervalued IMHO. Short term I see AAPL deserving 155, medium term 180 and longterm over 200.  Besides, what better place is there to put your money?

     "This is an amazing idea. Selling calls and getting your shares called away is safe. It just gives you one more hurdle to jump through if the stock does start tanking. You could always sell in the money or at the money calls instead of out of the money calls if you want more insurance. I often let my short calls go into the money and roll them for as long as they are profitable before letting my shares get called away. This is the safest way to trade covered calls with insurance. Good luck man. Learn cash secured puts next and you\u2019re rolling with a really good proven strategy."

     "I think the most important aspect of your post is that you clearly see this as a learning opportunity to \"get your feet wet\". I took the plunge over two years ago and there is no better education then actual experience. \n\nOne or two comments about the precise strategy that you are proposing: ie, buying 400 shares of Apple and writing covered calls; first, Apple doesn't love you and actually no stock loves you. Stocks are not wives or girlfriends. They do not get jealous if you look at another stock and invest in other stocks. Stocks don't know your timetable and they don't know your particular circumstances. They are not stable even though they look as stable as a mountain.  (Apple might be on the losing end of the Epic Games lawsuit and get a nifty pullback if that happens. Yes Apple will be worth much more in the future in the years to come, but that doesn't help if your account value drops 20% and your calls only covered a 2% drop.)  So diversify. Look at maybe 4 or 5 stocks and that way you can also get a better feel as to how they behave and you can employ other different time horizons.  \n\nBTW, if you can move some of the money into a Roth or tradional IRA you'd be better off with doing so since taxes won't be an issue and you won't have to worry about the \"Wash Sale Rules\" regarding disallowance of losses under certain circumstances.  \n\nHope this helps."

     "On the most basic level, there are two answers:\n\n1. Not everything is about options, greeks, IV, etc.\n2. \"Implied volatility\" is bullshit.\n\nStarting with #2, obviously an options trader needs to understand and monitor IV. What I mean by \"bullshit\" is that IV isn't some sort of objective output of mathematics & statistics, it's a measure of market demand. A high IV just means there's a lot of interest in the option. Consider AMD August 06 options: a week ago the ATM IV was 2.55%/day, today it's 5.25%. It's the opposite of the typical \"IV crush\" as options get closer to expiry. The same is going on with MRNA. These are indeed outliers.\n\nSo what do we do about these? For most trading, you just keep them in mind as outlier risks. (They are, for example, the reason we don't all just constantly sell a thousand OTM spreads that have a 0.05 risk/reward, because the few times they go against you, they destroy you. The big option sellers have enormous mathematical models to create hedges to avoid that, and they still make mistakes.) If you want to occasionally play bets on huge swings in price with a tiny amount of your portfolio, that's fine, just be prepared to usually lose.\n\nOn #1, there were indeed targets this high. On July 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari set a target of $111.00. On July 20, before earnings, Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay set a target of $120.00. Immediately post-earnings, before the run-up, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann set a target of $150. Did you listen to these? LOL, probably not, and neither did I, because usually these targets are, at best, a guidepost for the next year, not some sort of short-term bet, so we skim the consensus number and that's that.\n\nA run-up this high was in the cards: on the day of earnings, AMD was trading at a P/E of 32.51, P/S of 8.34, EV/EBITDA of 37.39. All of these were near or at bottom for the past six months, and far lower than averages for the past year, past few years, etc. Maybe that's what attracted you to AMD in the first place. It sure attracted me, and so I've been playing AMD, though I missed this particular jump. If these kinds of numbers were a guarantee of a huge stock movement in the near future then we'd all be loading up INTC. And maybe INTC does pop in the future, that's not a crazy play, lots of hedge funds are doing it.\n\nBut here's the thing: 99.9% of the time, stocks with all these same signals do *not* suddenly jump up in price, and if you could regularly predict when that would happen, if you could even get it right a mere 10% of the time, you'd soon be a billionaire. The reality is, dumping your money into something on the hopes of a sudden change in price is no different from a WSB YOLO, even if we options traders dress it up in complicated math. It's a good way to lose your shirt. You're better off sticking to things that are regularly and safely producing a return."

     "I have mixed feeling on selling prior to earnings. Beucase of exactly what happened. If youre buying weekly options then yeah, youre playing with fire holding options through earnings. But if you have options contracts that has a lot of time left after the earnings call then you have time to recover. If your options contracts has months left until expiration then holding through earnings is not going to hurt you too bad. I bought calls on AMD at the end of June and they were down 50-80% leading up to earnings. I have been slowly (maybe prematurely) selling my calls all for profits of 150-300%. My calls expired in September, November, and December. I like to stagger mine. \n\nWith that being said, I think people grossly missunderstood the position AMD is in. The signs were all there. Technically AMD was finishing up making a cup-and-handle formation. Say what you want about charts but they are a great indication of market sentiment and direction. \n\nFundamentally, AMD has been stealing market share quite aggressively from Intel. Intel's last earnings call was a huge sign. Literally every semi-company is reporting great numbers except Intel. Intel's last earnings call was not very positive. AMD's revenue has been growing rapidly over the last year. On top of the company actually hitting on all cylinders, the semiconductor industry as a whole is rapidly growing. Demand is severely outstripping supply. Then you have another positive catalyst with the potential of the Xilinx purchase. Frankly, I see no reason why China will approve it, but I have been wrong in the past. \n\nEven after earning, with the astronomical increase in volume when AMD broke the $96 price point. That was a huge buy signal since it was the completion of the cup-and-handle pattern. If you would have loaded up on September calls after earning after the huge first day run up, you would be sitting nicely."

I was in the same situation with AMC call options, selling them with little over 40% profit before it went ballistic, but you know what? I felt proud, it was a good trade, I sold for a profit :D ... Usually I see the underlying move up, many times hitting ATH and then hold on the way down, ending up in a loss because \"I\u00b4m sure it will go back up\". Predictions and TA are good tools to take into account, but at the end of the day you can\u00b4t see the future and neither can the people writing the articles/posts; there are many variables that influence the price and as a single individual you have no control over them. So congratz on being smart enough to take a 30% profit, and it might feel like crap to miss the rocket but it would feel way worse to fall into a pit."

     "I think the advice offered on this sub is consistently misleading when it comes to discussions of how options behave around earnings. \n\nHere is an example of a very misleading statement: \"I've read many times to never hold through earnings and sell your contracts as IV will crush your profitability.\" Terrible advice for a tech stock like AMD.\n\nHere is a point that I have raised at least a dozen times (and if you check my posting history you will see that): The argument that IV crush will crush your long strangle or call or put is a very misleading argument. A bet on earnings for a tech stock like AMD is a bet on a tail event, and if that event transpires, if you have a strangle one of the legs is at or near one delta and the other leg is worthless (if the expiry is near-term). If at one delta, then you should not care what the \"IV\" is. The IV that has fallen is the IV that is at or near the money, but you don't care about that, because of the tail event, you are very far away from the money and highly profitable.\n\nAMD has a history of robust tail events. In the models that I use to track and trade earnings I calculate the size of the earnings reaction as a log growth percentage and compare it to the Implied Daily Volatility of the 90 days prior to the day of research, and I call that ratio XSigma. So if a stock has a movement that is two times the scale of recently-estimated 90-day implied daily volatility, that is a 2-XSigma move. A rough rule of thumb is that any any move beyond 2 XSigma will offer a profit to an earnings strangle placed before market close on the day of earnings. Of their last 11 quarterly earnings reports, the report triggered a tail event (above 2XSigma) on 7 of those reports. (The last one was pretty much break-even for a strangle at almost exactly 2XSigma). Of the last 13 quarterly earnings reports from AMD, only ONE, the Jan 26, 21 report, triggered a negative response at -2XSigma. \n\nAnyone selling before SNAP's report this quarter would feel far worse than you. SNAP closed at around 62.50 on Wed July 22 just minutes before their earnings report, and the Friday expiry options were trading at about 4-sigma. A 62.50 Call was pegged at 2.79 at 12:17:51 with an estimated daily implied volatility of 0.1176, which was 4 times recent 90-day historical volatility. At market open at 6:37:13 the day after earnings SNAP was at 77.57 and the call had a selling peg of 15.47. (The 61.50 Put, originally priced at 2.58, was worthless). \n\nSo what was the after-earnings IV of the call that went from $2.79 per share to $15.47 per share overnight? I guess we don't really care, do we? \n\nFinally, these price targets and the \"expected prices\" based upon options that get published are largely worthless. They assume away tail events and tail events are everything in earnings releases, at least for big tech stocks.\n\nIf you were worried about your long-standing position in AMD, you could have hedged that with some cheap throw-away $80 or $82 puts."

Apollo Group (NASDAQ: APOL) is due to announce earnings after the close of trading on March 27. On February 26, a trader might have considered buying a long straddle or a long strangle in order to be positioned if the stock reacted strongly one way or the other in the run up into the earnings announcement. In this case, APOL was trading at $65.60 a share. The trader could have bought one contract each of the April 70 call at $5 and the April 60 put at $4.40. The total cost to enter this trade would be the cost of the two premiums, or $940. This represents the total risk on the trade. However, the likelihood of experiencing the maximum loss is zero because this trade will be exited before the earnings announcement and thus well before the April options expire.\r  \n\n\nExample Trade 2: Stock Earnings Release (Non- directional Trade)\r  \nDetermine the Magnitude of Post Earnings move with Straddles\r  \nAnalyzing options to make earnings predictions is to attempt to determine the magnitude of the anticipated move after the earnings announcement. Since most options appreciate in value when volatility increases, implied volatility can tell us when the market is anticipating a big move to the upside or downside. Luckily, straddles are designed to take advantage of implied volatility, so we can use them to calculate an exact magnitude.\r  \n\r  \nStraddles represent an options strategy that involves purchasing call and put options with the same strike price and expiration date. By purchasing an at-the-money straddle, options traders are positioning themselves to profit from an increase or decrease in the stock price. Therefore, looking at the price of the at-the-money straddle can tell us the magnitude of this implied volatility.\r  \n\n\nPractice Trade: Google\r  \nPrior to  the earnings announcement we purchase one at-the-money Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) call option for $1,200 per contract and one at-the-money GOOG put option for $1,670 per contract, then the cost of the at-the-money straddle will be $2,870 plus any commissions paid. With GOOG's underlying shares trading at $575.50 per share, this means that we can expect a move of approximately 5% or $2,870 / ($575.50 x 100): $2,870 / 57,550 = 0.0498%."

At $3300, its the time to at least initiate a position if you dont have one already.\\n\\n2. $AMZN currently sits at an IV rank of 1%. That means over the past year the IV has been higher 99% of the time. What makes IV swell? Earnings. What happens when IV swells? The price of the underlying option goes up. \\n\\n3. The S&P 500 is up 19.26% YTD, 30.66% over the past 365 days. $AMZN is essentially flat in both regards and is the worst-performing FAANG name on a yearly basis.

     "This is incredibly well said. I have come to similar conclusions about AMZN and it is my highest conviction play at the moment. I have 3550/3750 spreads open for September 2022. They cost about ~6,500 each and they payout ~13,000 if AMZN is over 3750 in a year. I went with a year because then it will be a long term hold and not a short term one. It's still speculative because if the whole market has huge issues between now and then they will become nearly worthless, but considering AMZN reached that price just a couple months ago gives me an extreme amount of confidence in this."

     "I think you did thorough research and I agree with most of what you're saying here. My only hesitation and point that I would bring up is the both QQQ and SPY are both trading at all time highs, and we haven't seen a real 5-10% pullback/correction since April. With the market trading super hot right now, delta looming and inflation data not looking good in the short term, I think we are more than due for at least a 5% pullback across many sectors, if not more so in big tech.\n\nAnother interesting point of bullishness I can see for Amazon in terms of TA is looking at the One year chart with weekly candles and the 50 day Simple Moving Average. In the past year or so time frame, each time AMZN has dropped down to its 50SMA, it tends to bounce off it as support. As of today it seems to be using the 50SMA as support again and a green candle is forming. I would be inclined to agree with you that it is at a strong support level and your position seems well suited for strong gains"

     "tl;dr: ya, it works til' it doesn't\n\nLet me teach you something about the market and why you shouldn't cling too tightly to this.\n\nMathematically speaking, stocks are assumed to be a random walk with a mean return of 0. It's just as likely to go up than it is to go down. Now, historically if you look at mean returns, SPY gains around 1.04%/month, with of course a large degree of variance. But, this mean above 0 shows that historically if you bet on Spy going up in a month, you're right more than you're wrong.\n\nDo you trust historical return or do you trust math?\n\nIf you believe that SPY is a random walk, mathematically, this strategy will not make you profits in the long run. If you believe in the historical returns, then as long as you keep relatively consistent bet sizing, you'll be right more than you'll be wrong and make long term profits.\n\nBut before you answer which do you trust more, math or historical averages, think about this: if stocks did always go up in the long term, why doesn't every person just buy calls and everyone makes money in the long run? Wouldn't you just borrow against the interest rates, collect a ton of money, and then spend that on calls each month and basically take advantage of this arbitrage? I mean, 1%/month is better than interest rates right!\n\nThe fact is regardless of historical averages, you just cant assume the mean returns of the stock market is anything but 0.\n\nNot even regarding all the other factors such as paying more theta than you would collect from gamma/delta, vol crash, etc; long term this strat wont make you money.\n\nWith that being said, if you've been lucky with timing and selling before expiration, that's great, keep up the good work, but don't confuse lucky timing with a profitable long term strategy.\n\nStudy up on some black scholes and understand how options price in skew of returns and volatility, it may clarify some things."

I did that because I was happy with the 2x+ return, but also because i wasn\u2019t sure what would fully happen when the market price hit my strike price.  I know the option had plenty of time to mature, but what would have happened had I let it go and possibly go ITM tomorrow?

     "Hey guys, I am pretty new here so I can\u2019t post but I want to ask about how I lost money on my Netflix strangle with a huge price drop after the earning call.\n\nSo I bought 500 put and 600 call on 4/20 when Netflix stock price was 550. 500 put costs 2.42 and 600 call costs 3.5 with expiration date 4/23. During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. \n\nNext day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.\n\nFrom my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.\n\nI consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?"

If you didn't go long after earnings then that might be on you haha. \n\nJokes aside, stepping away from the market is certainly a viable answer, but what if you step away from the market for a few days and buy back into the same play(s) you would have before? \n\nTry read \"Thinking Fast and Slow\", it is a really good book for understanding psychology and mentality. It talks a good deal about mean reversion as it relates to expectations. The example  in the book is of positive vs negative reinforcement. Compliment someone for doing extraordinarily and they seem to do worse the next time, harass someone for doing something terribly and they seem to do better. This is not because negative reinforcement is better, but because a GREAT performance is just that--great, extraordinary, *unusually* good.\n\nWhenever you make an extremely successful trade you want to believe that you've finally got *it* and whether you want to or not, you set your expectations higher in the near future and vice versa for poor trades. \n\nNow for actual advice after you've set your expectations, try either stepping away for a little while, lowering your position size temporarily, or lower your risk via different option strategies or investing a portion in stocks with a week/month time horizon."

     "You are on the right track. Here are some suggestions for you to help remove psychological pressure from trading time. \n\nWhen evaluating your actions, don't ask yourself whether the trade you made was a good trade or bad trade. It's very hard to \"make good trades\" and it puts too much pressure on you when a trade goes wrong. It's much easier to \"make a good strategy\" and to \"follow a strategy\". So instead you can ask yourself\n\n1. Is my strategy a good one?\n2. Do my trades match my strategy?\n\nYou should expect a certain percentage to fail based on your strategy, and as long as it's in the right range you don't need to investigate every trade.\n\nI think you believe in your strategy. The question is why did you deviate from the strategy? The most common mistake is when your strategy too vague, which allows you to \"fudge\" your decision making process. Maybe you can write down exactly what your strategy is and look for situations that match. Never change your strategy during a trading session.  If you want to make a trade that doesn't match your strategy, force yourself to wait until trading time is over and update your strategy.  When making a trade, state out loud to yourself why the trade matches your strategy. Then you remove your psychology from the equation, and you have a simple test you can do to see if a trade is strategic or emotional.\n\n\n> Any logic to stepping away from the market for a few days or rest of week after a big score?\n\nNo, not just because of the big win. You should step away if you catch yourself deviating from your strategy, whether the trade wins or loses. You can also step away if you feel strongly tempted and you're worried you will deviate. \n\n\nContext for this recommendation: There is a psychological study done where people are given two tasks, one easy and one cumbersome. They are given a coin and asked to assign one task to themselves and one to a stranger based on the outcome of a coin flip.  Almost 80% gave themselves the easy task, despite the probability of winning the coin flip being 50%. By first asking them to write down whether heads or tails meant they would get the easy or cumbersome task, and to read the rules out loud right before flipping the coin. By doing this, the tasks were handed out fairly."

I shall attempt to break it down for you. \n\nMU - simply a case of technical movement, and supply meets demand. You will monitor this stock if you are into technical. Volatility crush is also real for stock prices. But if you don\u2019t believe technical and you are into fundamental, tell me you have seen it\u2019s PE, business model, demand, profit margin, and are unconvinced of the ongoing demand.\n\nNVDA - there is a reason why some stocks keep breaking new high and some stocks keep breaking new lows. NVDA has the fundamental, acquisition expectation, product demand, and profit margin. I bought at $605 and it\u2019s now $800. After stock split it is only going to go up higher, if previous studies of stocks\u2019 price movement after stock splits are anything to go by. \n\nAMD - i watched it since it was $60+ last year. Is it too much now? Maybe not the cheapest. But definitely not going down any moment. And I\u2019m going vertical spread, PMCC, and naked puts with it. Majority of my options profit was from like 20+ trades on AMD, in the past 2 months. \n\nTsm - I owned it at $63 and it\u2019s only going to go up higher with the world\u2019s largest producer of something that every product manufacturer needs, from aircon, to your fan and TV. In fact I\u2019ve just initiated a PMCC position with it.

Until AMD can lead some aspect of tech or have a wide enough product line to bring in more revenue investors wont like into it. Traders keep the cycles going but investors push the trend up. Investor buy in happens when they see the growth potential. Thats why when they came out with ryzen the writing was on the wall and everyone bought in after the sales started to flow and deals started to be made. \n\nWhile AMD is clearly eating Intel\u2019s lunch on cpus, their gpus do not compare to nvda yet and they dont even offer storage or networking solutions. They have to expand or else investors will sell off since the growth isnt there. You can def make money trading on the short term trends though amd is so cyclical"

     "Very interesting. So this trader plans to exit or adjust the position this week, since the June portion expires at the end of this week.\n\nThe position appears to be delta negative overall, so this is a bearish position. I believe the calls are the trader's insurance. Anyone else have a take?\n\nQuick edit: Deep in the money puts will move more or less 1:1 with the market if Apple moves downward. Way out of the money calls will barely budge (can't go much lower than a couple pennies!). So any downward movement by Apple this week is profitable. If Apple leaps up, though, the calls will cover his loss on the puts."

     "IV on long-term options like yours barely budge, unlike IV on near-expiry options. \n\nThe market just closed as I type this (Friday) but I am guessing that you paid between $11 and $12 for these calls?  Your only real enemy is time decay. If AAPL stays right where it is right now, you will see a more-or-less linear (not truly linear) decay in that value to zero. Effectively, AAPL must get up to around 250 or so for you to break even, and the sooner the better.\n\nI don't understand why you would think IV would crush you. Even if IV did shoot up for earnings, which it won't with that expiry, it would raise the value of your call, perhaps to a level that would be profitable to sell. How can that be bad? It could give you an artificial selling opportunity.\n\nRegardless, if IV starts at 1 sigma (IV equals historical volatility .. is where it \"should\" be), then it goes to 4 sigma at earnings, the price is inflated, then after earnings it goes back to 1 sigma, you are right back where you were ... no damage done.\n\nThe takeaway ... earnings might actually pop your stock to give you an early profitable exit (or of course dash your hopes for good). You might consider developing a sub-strategy for the reaction in anticipation of earnings ... [If earnings or guidance pushes this stock to this X threshold, then I will sell].\n\nAnd don't be discouraged by members who diss you for taking a directional bet. Most (many?) of us don't make directional bets, but if that is your bailiwick, then bet it like you mean it. Your greatest teacher will be you P&L at the end of these experiments.\n\nGood luck and welcome to the club."

Also think about short term vs long term taxes. Make sure to do it more than a year out in case your shares are assigned at the end.\n\nEdit: take a look at the charts too. If you would have done that this year, you would\u2019ve missed out on significant gains. It grew 77% this year. Not sure how other years compare, but that\u2019s a lot to miss out on."

There is about a 33% chance that the stock will hit the 145 limit and begin to be capped. There is about a 25% chance that the stock will exceed 156, the level where the upfront premium is less than the gain from the stock. so 1/4 of the time you 'loose', still green overall, but less profit than if you did not sell the option.\n\nSo yes, covered calls can be great, they increase your chance for success, especially if the stock falls or stays level. But, they are no means 'too good to be true' or 'free money'."

You could've adjusted your contract to account for the shift up if you were selling monthlies. If you sell at 360 dte there is no room for that adjustment and theta won't help you, you'll cry for 8-9 months."

Time value decreases slowly on longer dated options. I don\u2019t feel like looking up the details of this trade but look at the \u201ctheta\u201d of the option - this is the amount the option will decrease by per day. So if you sold it now you will have wait until all or most of that time decay reduces the value of the call option you sold which likely won\u2019t occur until it\u2019s close to expiring. \n\n\nTheta begins to decrease more rapidly the closer you are to expiration. Selling covered calls is better suited for time frames under 3 months. \n\nThere are other factors as well but this is the gist of it. Don\u2019t think that just because the stock moves above your call price that you will collect all of that premium immediately bc you won\u2019t.\n\nDefinitely learn the \u201cGreeks\u201d of options trading.\n\nEdit to add this comment:\n\nApple\u2019s one year gain is about 70%\n\nSo if you sold a covered call on Apple for a max 20% options gain a year ago you would have missed out on a 70% rally from just buying the stock and holding.

You realize your premium much faster in the last 30 days or so until expiry so if you stay exposed to that range of time continually on a rolling basis, your overall EV/time is much higher.\n\nGenerally you want to go a little further OTM, especially on such a long timespan tho. You\u2019re only giving yourself about 12% in upward room over a year before the $145s are otm. You\u2019re getting assigned a fair amount of the time there if things continue the way they have. I would be selling 145\u2019s 30-45 days out instead just to be safe."

     "As many people said, do weekly/monthly calls instead. You will have much more control over the investments and can play dips and peaks. For example, say AAPL is having a big run up and IV is high going to earnings, you can take advantage of this by selling weekly/monthly options during a high IV period and enjoy the options being IV crushed after the event.\n\nAnother note, you will have much better liquidity in rolling calls if you do end up going past strike price near expiry with weekly/monthly plays. Many times I have bought back ITM covered calls on expiry date for pennies on the dollar because the current price was just above strike.\n\nFinally, a note that I found mentally helpful. If you sell an option for a specific strike and the stock surges past that strike and it gets called away, and you feel like you \"lost\" money because you could have made more by just holding the stock, this is pure hindsight. If bought stock for $100/share, sold a $120C and it was $135 at expiry, there is no clear logic to assume you would have sold the stock at $135 at that date. You could have easily held it through expecting it to keep going up, and watched it crater back to $110, and then been actually worse off. \n\nPersonally, I make plays on high IV stocks on a run up, and while in a lot of cases such plays mean I am getting called away below what the stock is actually worth, I am fine with it because when I made the play I knew exactly what profits I was going to get, and I am happy with those. Plus, it takes your mind off it. If your covered call is deep ITM, I know Im making max profit from that strategy, and I don't have to care anymore about that play."

     "* Understand that you can make profitable options trades whether a stock, sector ETF, or index goes up, down, or sideways.\n* Trade ETFs - Lower volatility is less painful to newbie, small traders. Consider ETFs like GLD, IWM, QQQ, SLV, SMH, SPY, TLT, UNG, VXX, and XLK. I've also traded DBA, CORN, XLF, XLP, and XLV, but these tend to be less liquid and therefore have higher bid-ask spreads.\n* Diversify among asset classes and sectors -  Research ETF correlation matrices. Try [ETFScreen.com](https://ETFScreen.com). Are GLD and SMH correlated? If yes, is the correlation positive or negative?\n* Start with simple strategies to learn the mechanics of trading (buying calls), then move up to defined-risk trades (iron condors), and then try undefined-risk trades (strangles).\n* Mix strategies and durations. Buy an ATM Jan call in XLK and sell an OTM Nov bull put spread in GLD. Watch how they move.\n* Don't even imagine going BIG on anything. Cap the size of your trades at maybe 3% of your total account. If you think you've got a table-pounding sure thing...maybe go up to 5%. Don't use more than 70% of your account's buying power.\n* Study: implied volatility, delta, theta, bid-ask spreads, navigating option chains, non-directional trades\n* Cut your losses **and** your profits, I usually exit a position it hits a 45% loss or a 50% profit usually within 30 days of opening the position.\n* Pay yourself. I take out about 2% of my account's value every month.\n* Find a trading buddy who has more experience and money than you do. It's a good thing to be able to talk to someone about trades before you make them.\n\nHave fun!"

I chalked it up to the cost of education and have made it all back and more from the lessons learned.\n\nSpeaking of QQQ, check out the after hours chart to see the guy who accidentally bought 400,000 shares after close today (9/18).

     "In my opinion the biggest mistake is blaming the instrument (ie a call or a put being \u201criskier\u201d than a spread. Calls and puts are risk defined if you trade with risk management in thought. Just because something is more leveraged doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s riskier, it\u2019s just an increase in exposure... which is something hedge funds and institutions use to their advantage especially when swing trading. Just remember if you are going to switch to spreads only and make pennies on the dollar that you should not use a delta oriented strategy because if you believe a stock will go up, then a flat out call is going to be way better than a spread. Just know when to close it and that knowledge simply comes with time and experience in the specific strategy you are implementing. For example if you are shorting a dead cat bounce after earnings (shorting at the hump) and the stock goes down from the hump to test intraday lows, but you hold your puts once the stock has fallen in hopes of breaking those intraday lows. 9/10 times that would just be retarded and greedy. Although if you want to keep the concept of having a runner to accentuate gains, average out of your position enough so that a complete (or close to it) loss on the contracts you would have left in the short would not eat enough into your profits to turn a good trade into a bad one. #1 thing with risk management is averaging in and out, and using your last contracts as \u201cplaying with the profits\u201d of you feel confident.

You need to think about the stock market in the long term, it will always go back up eventually as long as the people believe in it as an investment strategy. One other suggestion I have is only invest in companies you use and believe in. As long as those companies are doing good business, their stock will continue to go up in the long term. \n\nIf you want to trade shares, I would recommend you only take positions that are no bigger than 10% of your portfolio so the swings do not affect you as much. Trading is hard but you can be profitable if you spend the time to learn and stick by strict rules. Remember that investing is not the same as trading and some 90% of traders lose money.\n\nIf you lost money playing with options, consider that a very cheap lesson in speculative trading. I would recommend you do not play with options if you don't have experience in trading shares. DO NOT BUY WEEKLY options, those are VERY unprofitable in the long run."

In a case like this you want to use either a Reverse Iron Condor or a Reverse Iron Butterfly just case the stock starts to do things out of the ordinary. \n\nBut, normally stocks that have low volatility, they normally don't do this. However, this also depends on what rates delta, theta, gamma, vega and tho we're at followed by implied volatility along with open interest. Always look at these. When buying calls or doing call spreads go long but if your writing calls or puts you go short do to the issue of time decay. With stocks that exhibit low volatility you use a  butterfly or an iron condor. It's only used when you have a stock that presents a Delta Neutral pattern, meaning little to no movement.

It is expiration Friday,so big moves are likely. Picture the market being a runner and that you can only run so far before you are out of breath. When you run out of breath and got tired instead of putting your hands on your knees or walking to cool down you consolidated or walked/ran backwards to cool down. Also like any runner you build up your distance and endurance each time you run. This is the market right now; it is building up endurance to run (longer sell offs) and these sharp rallies are cool down periods. Which brings me to a conflicted moment. There is a level that if we fall below it opens up the pandoras box of sell side activity. That level I believe to be around 450 on the spy. Can we build up enough endurance to run that far, will large fund managers join the selling to get us there? I have said that large fund managers are doi'",

This list is an inverse of that list and displays tickers where IV is pretty low, thus, purchasing calls will likely be cheaper. For example, AAPL implied volatility right now is almost back to the pre-March lows. Remember a low IV can go lower and a high IV can go higher.

This and high IV makes this a good play regardless of outcome.  I think IV jump is such that one could buy a slightly otm put and then it would go up in price from volatility even if stock kept going up. One could also buy calls for after 3/9 and watch them increase in price from IV and price movement if it keeps up this momentum. AH closed above those prices too, $38.20 was last sale from what I can see. \n\nThoughts, anyone?"

Making money in this market is not the same as it was 2 years ago nor will it be the same 2 years from now. \n\nBeyond learning to evaluate Price/book, earnings, cash flow, debt and sentiment there's many methods of trading options. Butterflies are often used in trading, iron condors almost never, learning what options strategy to employ beyond call and put spreads can help develop your trader acumen. \n\nI'd recommend having multiple targets spanning sectors, start looking at the finviz maps and choose by sector. \n\nI think https://www.earningswhispers.com/ is useful for sorting and looking at different targets.\n\ngood luck!"

But the first scenario is a real possibility. Rare and unlikely, but real. Like when news came out that some iphones were spontaneously bursting into flames.\n\nBut now imagine you have all your money invested in AAPL calls that expire a few days after that news comes out... If it is below your strike on the expiration day, then you lose all of it. Buying an option means buying something with an expiration date and you never want to be left holding the bag of flaming dog poop on the expiration date.\n\nThat's why it is critical to diversify or to keep most of your account in cash. Yes, AAPL is an amazing company and the stock SHOULD always go up. But short term moves are normal and should be anticipated. Don't over commit to one position or strategy."

     "I don't think there are many retail traders putting a million dollars into a single option position... \n\nThat said, I would imagine that strike selection plays a pretty critical role. Certain strikes will tend to have more volume than others, like strikes that are divisible by 10 or 100. Theoretically, spreading out your strikes would help as well. Instead of trying to buy thousands of options at the 500 strike, buy some 500, some 490, some 480, some 510, some 520, etc. \n\nI think your expiration selection could be working against you, as well. I'm pretty sure the liquidity of options increases quite a bit when you are less than 3 months from expiration. \n\nLastly, overall market volume changes throughout the day, with the highest volume being at the beginning and ends of the trading day. Placing your orders at the correct time of day may provide you a little more liquidity. When a big company wants to buy a large number of shares, they may spread the order out over the course of a day or longer, you might need to do the same with your options."

     "Your biggest liquidity problems stem from the fact that you both trade ITM options and trade 6M from expiry.\n\nFor most stock options, the most liquid expiries are the front week, second week, and front month, in that order, and then usually each monthly beyond that. The monthlies expire the third Friday of each month. You trading at least 6 months out means you\u2019re not gonna find much liquidity compared to trading 1 month or 1 week out.\n\nITM options are quoted much wider than OTM or ATM options. So much so that it can be advantageous to buy the OTM option and then turn it into the ITM option by buying/selling stock. i.e buy 1 put and 100 stock to get a call, or buy 1 call and sell 100 stock to get a put. Look up put call parity if this is confusing.\n\nPeople trading OTMs close to expiry can have massive positions with no real issues.\n\nETA: Commenter who mentioned specific strikes is actually dead wrong. Market makers don\u2019t care about stuff like that, and they\u2019re the ones providing most of the liquidity. The high turnover on certain strikes is because retail prefers to take liquidity from those strikes, not the other way around."

     "My guess is as good as anyone else\u2019s in terms of where AAPL or anything else will be in the near or far future, but as far as reasoning to enter the trade is concerned, I find yours to be very reasonable and promising. It\u2019s actually kind of refreshing to see a reasonably thought out trade on this sub as opposed to the usual \u201cI bought 11/27 AAPL $500 calls and AAPL moved up by $1 today but how come my calls went down.\u201d\n\nPersonally, I would sell before the next ER though. And also ideally I try not to hold long options past 60 DTE as theta really starts to accelerate at that point, 45 DTE would be the absolute limit for me to hold a long option position if I had to push it, though again ideally I would have exited well before that point. \n\nAnother thing I personally try to do is that I buy right at or slightly itm. This starts producing immediate delta/gamma returns if the stock starts moving in your direction at all and the option continues to become deeper itm, and then if we run into increasing IV and all that good stuff, it makes for a good environment to exit those positions (such as before an ER). But your strike price is not so far from the money and I do feel AAPL should try to challenge ath at some point between now and next ER. But as I said my guess is as good as anyone else\u2019s :).

  "Text": "b'So I think we can all agree that the chip shortage will be great for all the Semiconductor companies (AMD, NVDA, ON, TSM) but I think TSM is the most solid play out of all of them. Why? They have longterm growth and uptrends and they basically control the majority of semiconductor manufacturing, which AMD and NVDA rely on to make their products. For example, they control 70% of the automobile chip industry while it makes up only 3% of their revenue (Wallstreet Journal). Crazy right? Also, TSM has a lower P/E ratio than AMD and NVDA, which makes it a better valued play than the other companies in general. With its low IV, its partnerships with companies like apple (VR chips), its soon to be chip factory in Arizona, and the fact that so many companies outsource to TSM, I think calls are a safe mid term play on TSM.

     "The biggest long term concern about TSMC has been that they're in Taiwan. If they weren't there, the valuation would be way higher. I'm long TSMC anyways, but that's the only reason I don't give it a larger percentage allocation. People were talking about China won't make any huge moves, then as we all saw in the middle of the pandemic they basically took over Hong Kong. If I were to pick the 'safest' semiconductor company, that benefits from this, it'd probably be ASML. It's really a monopoly any way you look at it."

As the great Peter Lynch once said: insidersmight sell their shares for any number of reasons, but theybuythem for only one: they think the price will rise. I couldnt find a data source that compiled all the buying and selling data for companies, so I made one. I created a Python script that picks up Insider Trading transactions for all publicly listed companies. I just completed it so I havent had time to test out the impact insider trades have on the stock price, but I thought you guys might think it was a cool source of data.

     "Some feedback since you asked for it in your readme:\n\n* pd.read_csv returns a dataframe so you don't need to construct another [here](https://github.com/lhwolff15/InsiderTrading/blob/main/InsiderTrading.py#L10-L11) and [here](https://github.com/lhwolff15/InsiderTrading/blob/main/InsiderTrading.py#L18-L19)\n* [This](https://github.com/lhwolff15/InsiderTrading/blob/main/InsiderTrading.py#L43) gets called in a loop and every time it rereads the csv. Better to pull the pd.read_csv out of that function scope and save it to a global you can access from inside the function.\n* If you do pull the CIK dataframe into a global variable, be careful about [inplace mutations](https://github.com/lhwolff15/InsiderTrading/blob/main/InsiderTrading.py#L20). Generally would be best to set the df index at the top of the function and use the df it returns in that function. That way you don't get unintended side effects.\n* Rather than asking people to go thru your script and replace variables, it would be better to structure this as a CLI. Lots of tools choose from for making a CLI but I think the simple solution works best in this case:\n      1. Set all those variables that you want users to change as params to insider_trading\n      2. Add `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` statement to the end of the file and then inside that if block use [ArgParse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to read the CLI commands and then call insider_training() with the values you got from ArgParse."

Fast-algos (not HFTs) use computers to parse the filings the second they hit EDGAR and will trade it near instantly (but this is true of nearly all Edgar filings). \n\nLastly, Peter lynch is wrong. There are *absolutely* scenarios where a ceo will make a big open-market acquisition of stock as a simple \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the sell/buyside. IIRC, the founder/chairman of OSTK used to buy big slugs as a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the shorts......and then lost like 70% over the next few years (this was back in the early 2010s. The stock has done better recently). Also sometimes CEOs will buy a slug to impress upon the board that they believe in their forward strategy, but that does not mean the stock is going up. \n\nThe thing is that when you are worth $20M-$40M (or more), money becomes less valuable and ego tends to drive decision making. It\u2019s tough to trade on that - is an insider buying bc of \u2018inside knowledge\u2019 or pure ego?"

My risk is then the entire $1200, and if the stock doesn't reach $200, I lose it all.\\n\\nHowever, I can instead sell the 200/190 3/17/23 put credit spread and limit my loss to ~$415. Obviously this limit the gains too (~$600 in this case), but I would also get the benefit of not even needing the stock to reach $200 to collect the money.\\n\\nAm I missing something or is this a viable alternative to calls?\"",

     "Maybe that's because this would be a put credit spread with both strikes ITM, not OTM.\n\nIf you sell a PCS for $415, that is your max gain.  Your max loss is $585.\n\nCredit spreads are a theta strategy, and thus 1) not worth opening with a whole year DTE, and 2) not worth opening ITM.  You want credit spreads to wind up OTM.  Purely statistically speaking, ToS tells me the March 2023 190p only has a 35% chance of expiring OTM.\n\nSure, AAPL doesn't have to reach 200, but it still does have to reach 195 for you to break even, and for that you have to wait a year."

Technically your \"breakeven\" is less than the strike price of the call.  You don't say what you paid for the shares, but if you pay $160 per share for 100 shares, and sell a 170 strike call for 7.85, your breakeven is 152.15, because if the stock drops below that, you will lose money on the deal overall.  But even that is an oversimplification, because long shares never expire, so the stock could come back up and you could still sell for a profit.\n\nYou're treating \"breakeven\" as though you will lose money if the stock closes above that price.  But you won't, as long as the strike is above the cost basis for your shares.  You're treating this short call as though it were a naked call.\n\nNow, even if we are talking about a naked call, no, this does not change your breakeven at expiration.

If my company didnt pay for it I would use Hulu or Amazon Prime.\\n\\nSecond HBO, Disney and others have their own streaming services and dont want their content on Netflix so now their movie selection suck. Most of the movies arent even American.\\n\\nThird Amazon and Apple will be able to out compete them because they get revenue from other sources such as data collection, cloud and can link to shopping, Alexa/Siri, etc.\\n\\nIn conclusion Netflix sucks and if it wasnt so expensive I would buy two year puts.'",

     "These are all just opinions including some of the comments.\nPurely from a strategic perspective, the streaming world is not a zero sum game. Any user might have some combination of Netflix, Amazon prime, Disney+, Apple TV+, Hulu+ etc.\n\nAll that Netflix needs to do is create enough attractive content to retain its customers who are already sticky and susbcribers. You and some of the folks here are grossly underestimating the value of stickiness in this business. And FOMO. Some cool new original show drops that everyone\u2019s talking about.. what happens then? It would cause people who left to come back. And then, they stay for another year before losing interest.\n\nEither way, I\u2019m bullish on Netflix, Disney as they have sufficient moats in this business."

     "I\u2019m conflicted.\n\nI agree with your assessment of their declining content quality. Also, I think a big part of what made Netflix so great before was the algorithm they used to make suggestions based on your ratings, I don\u2019t know what they changed or when they did it but it seems like it might coincide with when they switched from the star-based ratings to a simple thumbs up/down rating.\n\nTheir pricing is very inflated for the experience IMO and I have seriously considered just cancelling it altogether lately. Amazon Prime Video and Hulu have been getting more of my watch-time lately and Prime is worth the cost just for the delivery benefits, the Music/Video/etc services make their subscription all the more valuable. Hulu is cheaper but their commercials playing at like 130% of the volume of the shows is super annoying.\n\nAnyway, I remember when Netflix recently announced their most recent subscription price increase that their stock responded very positively. I\u2019d be willing to bet the majority of their investors underestimated the competition and overestimated the quality of Netflix during that stock price rise. Unless something big changes I think they\u2019ll start to see subscription rates dip quite substantially, eventually into a net loss of subscribers.\n\nBUT! I don\u2019t want to underestimate the sticky effect of longtime subscription holders just taking a super long time to wake up and drop the service\u2014I still remember hearing stories of people renting their landline telephones from AT&T or one of the Bell companies (can\u2019t remember atm) for decades as recently as the late \u201890s or \u201800s just because they\u2019d never looked at their bill and didn\u2019t know they had other options\u2014they were simply too used to the monthly bill to even consider other options. Granted, we live in a new age but people tend to be creatures of habit and I\u2019m not sure what sort of timeline this \u201cawakening\u201d would require.\n\nGood post, thank you, definitely going to watch them more closely now."

     "Imo Netflix has a bit of a moat - part intentional, part by accident. Keep in mind that they knew pretty early there would be competition - they started by taking down the Goliath we knew as Blockbuster. \n\nNow, what sets them apart? Well, first is the emphasis on original content you specifically can't get elsewhere (Disney+ wants movies in theatres ultimately, HBO max will just be on demand HBO content, etc. - there will always be alternatives for most of the other platforms' content). That is the accident.\n\nWhat is intentional? If you look at their content curation it is actually brilliant for two philosophies they live by:\n\n1) the focus is on keeping you from looking for something - the material doesn't need to be great, it just needs to be good enough. And in fact, it almost does this better when it's not super compelling because something that is A+ content requires heavy focus and not something you'll put on regularly for 3-4 hours. \n\n2) They let the creatives make the material, and they focus on providing a medium for it. They offer comedians deals for stand up specials that they produce, they work out deals with YouTube channels (and usually let them stream it on their end too which doubles as advertising, and they ask famous directors to make a movie exclusively for Netflix. They provide resources to content creators with built in audiences. Want to watch any of the new Chapelle specials? You better get a Netflix subscription. \n\nNetflix is trying to be for streaming what Budweiser is for beer. They are fostering a lifestyle. The desire is to be the case of beer you buy to share with the boys, not the drink you have on special occassion. Marc Randolph, one of the original creators does an amazing interview on the Tim Ferriss podcast if you want to learn more about the inner workings."
