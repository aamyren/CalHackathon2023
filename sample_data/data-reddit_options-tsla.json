You didn't write the strike below you share cost basis, I hope? Taking assignment is a winning outcome if you selected a strike for a gain on the shares, so just be satisfied with that. I know the FOMO of that huge coulda/shoulda/woulda gain is hard to swallow, but every other alternative may be worse.\n\nYou'd have to be very, very confident that you will make up the cost of a rescue plan, like buying the call back, to make it worth rescuing a winning trade."

What was the thought process of not managing earlier? \n\n\nAt the end of the day this is a winning trade.\n\n\nYou could roll up but you should dig around expiration etc to see where you get the biggest premium . \n\nPersonally if you're willing to take the risk you should probably roll this up till after earnings which is around 45 days because that's where you're going to get the most premium. You could even potentially roll up further into a debit but just make sure whatever you're paying is less than the width that you're expanding to\n\n\nSo you might pay 5 dollars to get 10 extra dollars (net 5)\n\nAlso you have to still be bullish or at least to whatever your short strike is going to be"

And roll again when they approach 60 DTE. Roll away and up but for a credit.\nThen I convert the trade into a strangle by selling a put. When selling a put you commit to buy 100 shares so make sure you have cash to cover it. If not I sell a put spread, but a strangle is the best because it helps rolling the entire structure up and down as needed for a credit.\nThen work out of the hole, roll them up little by little, strike by strike until you get them otm.\nAlso I sell shorter term puts so I can repeat the process again and again, e.g. 130 DTE calls but 7 DTE puts and so on. Play with it and see what is the best."

     "I\u2019m in the same position but I had been actively managing by rolling it up and out every week or so. So far, it\u2019s becoming a losing proposition as I now have my covered call expiring 6 months out at $240 strike.\n\nThe way I look at it is by considering the covered call as guaranteed income over time. If I roll out a covered call for minimal credit into next month, I consider this to be \u201cdividend\u201d or income at the same strike. If I roll it up and out, I will likely have to pay the difference but the jump in strike prices is also considered \u201cdeferred dividend\u201d.\n\nHere is an example using your expiration and strike:\n\nIf you roll out to the same strike to next month, you will receive an income of $190. Two months will give you $410 in income. Three months will give you $730 in income. Assuming these prices are accurate, the best bang for the buck is the 3 months as it guarantees you $240 a month.\n\nIf you want to roll up and out, you can pay now to guarantee slightly higher income. Next month, $5 strike higher ($190) would offer you $240 instead of $190. The next month, $5 strike higher ($195) would offer you $565 instead of $410. $5 strike higher ($200) would offer you $1,040 instead of $730.\n\nIf you are confident about where $TSLA price will be in the next six months, then be willing to pay upfront to guarantee income by that date. For example, I believe $TSLA will remain above $250 by January 2024. So I would pay $2,680 to guarantee me $3,800 in actual income or $630 a month.\n\nBut because you\u2019re paying upfront, you now have no leverage to use cash to get into more aggressive positions such as buying ATM or OTM call options for $TSLA.\n\nLet me know if this helps."

     "Current price of TSLA is 160.39 as of this writing.  If you are long TSLA and your target price is 190 by July here is a trade with a trade plan that you can look into for demo account only. It is for a long diagonal: Buy 1 July 165 call and Sell 1 May 170 (35 delta) call for a debit of 10.50.  Risk is 10.50 to the downside which will be realized if TSLA drops to 85 based on risk graph.  There is also a 5.50 risk to the upside if TSLA rallies to 300 by May expiration.  This is a long delta and long theta position.\n\nHow to manage if TSLA goes down: Sell to close position if TSLA underlying is less than 149.88.  This will result in a $170 loss based on risk graph. At this point, consider buying stock if you are still bullish.  This would have saved you $1000 had you bought stock at 160 (current price now), and then it dropped to 150 which would result is a $1000 loss on paper.\n\nHow to manage if TSLA goes up:  If TSLA rallies to 169 before May expiration (25 DTE) Buy To Close 170 call and Sell To Open June 180 Call 35 delta (or whatever delta that will net a credit)  for a credit.  You will now have a  July 165/ June180 call long diagonal.  If TSLA continues to rally to 180, Buy To Close 180 and Sell To Open July 190 Call.  The end result will be a July 165/190 Bull call spread.  At expiration, if the 190 is ITM, you can close as a spread, Sell to Close 165/190 for a credit of 25.00 at MOC.  If the 190 is not in the money at expiration, you can exercise your 165 call if you desire is to own the stock.  You will have the right to buy TSLA for 165 and sell CC or whatever your heart desires.  If any of the short strikes do not get touched, let the calls expire and sell weekly 35 deltas.  To summarize, you are selling 35 delta and buying to close and rolling when those deltas hit 48-50 when they are ATM and then selling a further out 35 delta or whatever strike will net a credit.   \n As I mentioned earlier, this position is long delta so as long as you close the shorts early enough before the deltas get too large, your position will profit each time you roll for a credit.  Your 165 longs will have a larger delta than the new short call's delta each time to roll.  What do you guys think?"

     "RSI doesn't mean anything by itself. RSI can help you add confidence to an entry based on price action or other technical signals. Especially on an individual stock, which might register as overbought on any time period's RSI but continue to run up for another 10% or more. RSI can be very powerful during a period of sideways movement to help you grab the top and bottom of a channel, but we're going through a major trend right now so momentum indicators don't say anything actionable other than \"yes, we're going up.\"\n\nI would absolutely expect a modest pullback on TSLA within the next week or so, but I think using RSI as your entry trigger was a mistake, and you didn't buy enough time on an option with no intrinsic value. A $215 put expiring in July would be a much lower risk trade with a good chance of returning a 30-50% profit if it pulls back this week, and an opportunity to exit at a moderate loss if it keeps running."

He is selling somewhere around the .80 delta calls to extract the extrinsic value from the options and planning to take assignment. He says he makes around 48%+ annualized returns doing this (4% per month \\\\* 12 months), which I'm highly skeptical about. Here is the [NVDA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDM6Be0KeA) and the [TSLA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2RuTls6AQA) I'm referring to.\\n\\nHere's a current example I came up with for TSLA using this method ([view on OptionsProfitCalculator here](http://opcalc.com/QIa)):\\n\\n* Buy 100 shares of TSLA at $196.48.\\n* Sell the 3/31 170C for $33.25 (\\\\~32 DTE).\\n* Total cost = $19,648 - $3,325 = $16,323 (breakeven at $163.23).\\n* Your shares get called away at $170 each, for a gain of $677 (4.15% return on the $16,323 of capital).\\n* Rinse and repeat monthly.\\n\\nI know there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm trying \"",

     "If it works, you make 4% a month.  Projecting that out 12 months is wishful thinking.\r  \n\r  \nDuring the October series last year, TSLA fell about 90 points.  Assuming that returned similar numbers as your example, it would take 3 successful cycles to make up that point loss.  But could you?\r  \n\r  \nSuppose you bought at $300 and sold the $275 CC for $37.  It drops to $210. Your short call expires.  Cost basis is $263 ($53 loss).  Now you're either going to have to write a lower strike that locks in a loss or you're going to have to sell an OTM CC with a further out expiration in order to get enough premium to break even (60 days, 90 days?).  How many months does that take? This all works until it doesn't.\r  \n\r  \nCCs and CSPs of the same series are synthetically equivalent.  Why do this in two transactions (stock + CC) when you can do it in one (CSP)?  Fewer commissions, fewer fees, less bid-ask slippage.\r  \n\r  \nWash sales are meaningless as long as you are out of the stock by the end of the year and you stay out for 30 days.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are fine with owning the stock at the net cost (stock price less premium received for the CC), go for it.  But risking money because the premium is high isn't the best choice."

     "If you buy the shares for $196.48 and sell the 31Mar23 170C for $33.25 and share price is below $170 at expiration then technically your cost basis hasn't dropped.  You will have collected $33.25 on one trade and your account will still show a cost basis of what you paid for the stock, which, in this example, would be $196.48.\n\nFor tsla to drop below $170 at expiration on 31mar23 it would require a 13% drop in value, which is nothing for tsla.  Just look at price change from 2dec22 to 4jan23 to 2feb23.  It went from $194 down to $108 and then back at $188. So it drop 44% from 2dec22 to 3jan23 and then rose almost 75% from 3jan23 to 2feb23.\n\nNever sell covered calls on stocks that you don't want to own."

     "I cringe every time I see \"deep ITM\" and \"sell to open\" in the same sentence.\n\nAnyone who calls themself a \"wealth architect\" might as well have \"scammer\" tatooed to their forehead.\n\nThe trade scheme boils down to selling overpriced volatility. That's standard credit trading mechanics and can be accomplished any number of ways, most of which, IMO, have better risk/reward and other characteristics. For example, you could obtain a similar rate of return by rolling OTM short puts, only the puts should have less opportunity cost.\n\n> Wash sale rule could cause tax implications if you rebuy shares that are called away without waiting 31 days (i.e. must pay taxes on the full premium received, but can't write off the \"loss\" of the shares).\n\nAs long as you close the washing trade in the same tax year, this is a non-issue.\n\n> There is no upside potential if the stock moves higher.\n\nYes, but that's true of all credit trading and/or delta-neutral strategies for selling overpriced vol. So not really a negative.\n\n> Lower risk to the downside on the trade (compared to selling OTM covered calls).\n\nI understand why you think that, but it's basically not true. They both have the same downside risk on the stock side. In the ITM CC case, you got more upfront premium, but at higher risk of assignment with attendant higher loss of potential gains on the shares. In the OTM CC case, you have less upfront premium, with lower risk of assignment and lower potential loss of gains.\n\n> If the stock does drop significantly, your cost-basis/breakeven has been lowered considerably\n\nThat's just a restatement of the previous \"advantage\".\n\nTo me, the biggest negative about the scheme is that it is grossly inefficient of capital. There are more efficient ways to use that amount of capital or better ways to use less capital for the same risk/reward.

The bank has a margin on TSLA 13 billion dollar loan to fund TWTR - the lower TSLA goes the more stock gets sold on margin . I just read the Shanghai plant is closed. \n\nTSLA earnings comes out Jan 25 th . They will probably scrape by on top and bottom line. All eyes will be on the guidance . What can Musk say positive ? A share buyback . Musk is a cagey shrewd businessman. He might want to deflate shares making a buyback cheaper , and calling in more shares. A reverse dilution makes his shares worth more - less in the market to buy . Driving the price up could be a result of that . Of course TSLA in its present state might not have the free cash flow to buy back 10-15 billion right now . They didn\u2019t have it to buy TWTR . \n\nTheir brand is wrecked right now , Musk is distracted with TWTR. No one is flying the TSLA plane it\u2019s on autopilot. \n\nYour problem is : \n\n(1) As soon as the stock significantly rises on an announcement the holder of the long put will sell  . That will lead to an assignment . \n\n(2) As of closing you are -103.00 per share in the red , the difference between your strike and the price . Each option you sold is - 10,300 at present . If you only secured the put with 10,000 - the exchange house will sell off 300 from your equity account - at that point they may close you out of the trade as your debit exceeded the CCP. Or , you can give them more money and hope that TSLA will go back up - but what if it dips to 90? Another 30 points is about 3000 per option more of your money gone. \n\nChances are as soon as the stock goes up 5-10 points you will be assigned and lose between 9000-10000 per option written"

If we do resolve this chop to the upside, I think there's a good chance we see tsla take off. the chips and AI plays are extended, aapl is aapl, the remaining high beta megacap that's acting as safe haven from the regional bank crisis that hasn't left the station are tsla and amzn. Last week, it formed a consolidation range around the 20d MA, which I will use as my risk. If it goes up, you have both delta and IV working for you going into earnings, but I'd probably take profit on most into earnings, and perhaps sell some higher strike contracts if I do end up holding into earnings.\n\nI also think it's a mistake to look at open interest in that manner. you don't know whether those are bought or sold, part of a spread, covered call or hedge against a short. it's a roadmap to nowhere."

     "I'm new-ish to options, so I tried running a straddle scenario through the numbers last night for Tesla's earnings day. My conclusion was that it would take an out-of-the-ordinary move in response to the earnings report to make a straddle likely to profit. All data, unless otherwise noted, was taken from E-Trade around 23:00hrs Eastern last night. Here's my math:\n\n* Price at close on 23 Jan  = $144.75\n* Max earnings move in last 6 quarters was 12% ($17.37 if closing price on 23Jan is used)\n* The premium for a $145 strike contract (1 put and 1 call) was $13.65 (or 9.43% of the close price of 23Jan) ... but I didn't note down when the contract expiration was for this. If I had to guess, I think it was the next monthly.\n* The underlying price would have to move above $158.40 or below $131.10 to be ITM\n\nGiven the premium would require a move over 9% to be ITM, and the largest recent earnings moves were 12%, this was unlikely to be a winning play.\n\nIf there was more information available, maybe one would have more confidence in the move. TSLA being a volatile mess, I don't have the funds to risk just based on the above.\n\n... this is where someone points out my simple math mistakes, probably."

Where and how many you sell is up to you and how much you wanto to increase your break evens by. Selling 1x 135 call would make your trade delta neutral right now. If you want to keep being long TSLA You could sell further out of the money call and keep rolling the call down if Tesla keeps moving down. If you want to increase your break even sell closer to the money calls. Selling naked calls gives you the most flexibility to adjust the trade going forward.\n\n2) Sell the same ratio spread on the call side like you sold for the put side.\n\n2) Less agressive option would be to sell a call credit spread to increase your credit collected and get a better break even to the down side. Also, won't require any additional capital. Depending on how much credit you collected you could sell a call credit spread that collects enough additional credit to cover the width of the call spread and then you still have no risk to the upside. You can roll down the call spread if TSLA keeps moving down but you collect small credits to do it."

     "A straddle is the expected move on expiry... For TSLA, last I checked (market closed), a Friday expiry would cost you around $13. That's 9% move priced in for 2 days (25 bought, 26, 27). \n\nWith longer-term straddle (2wks+), it must move violent enough so that your contract is worth more due to IV expansion and just \"being very right\". \n\nWith short-term straddle like this, IV after earning will almost always stabilise and not \"expand\" like your theory. Now this does not mean that you will not profit, but you now rely on breaching BEP as opposed to just \"being directionally right\". If you breach BEP, in 2 days, IV crush does not matter. If you are confident that TSLA will be >157 or <131, do it, but your straddle will be in the red most of the time, until they breach either of those two walls. \n\nHave you thought about credit spreads instead?\n\nIt will only be volatile, if on earnings call it shoots up from 144 to 154, then the morning after it craters to 134... if it continues to go up (or down), there is nothing volatile/unknown about it for the week, you just know where it is heading and IV will stabilise (or crush whatever you name it). \n\nBut then with a very short-term straddle, pingponging like that will not get you money, that will just burn you the value of time (theta), and you will lose value. So no, if you want to buy long 26/1 straddles, your volatility thesis is likely wrong. Got to depend on breaching BEP by the 27th."

Just know that you are on the hook to buy 100 shares of TSLA at $500, which last week was the equivalent of buying TSLA at $1500.\n\nEDIT: I can only see the value of the last trade--a third put sold at that strike.

     "Critique my plan. I am leaning towards selling credit spreads or diagonal after conference, getting out quickly at $150-200. However this would be my plan if I open all day:\n\nMost FOMC days have been red, yet tomorrow has pause expectation. This could send them to wild upswing when expectations are not met. \n\nI plan on entering a short-call ladder in the morning for 250-300 credit. If I could enter 4385c & 4360/-4340c for -300 credit, why shouldn't I? I need to make 4402 to profit, or it needs to go below 4343.10. 4402 represents 0.8% from today's close, and 4343.10 represents 0.7%. Pretty symmetric. Cheaper than a 4355/4385 strangle. \n\nThings I have considered beyond \"it could end up at 4355, satisfies \"red on FOMC statistics\", and still kill you\"\n\n1. **It is still a bullish strategy.** Why? Because if it goes up sharp, I can close the whole thing for big money in minutes. \"Unlimited\" upswing profit potential. The 4385c would love this, even at 4380 it would probably be profitable. \n\n2. Yet when it goes down to 4330, due to elevated volatility and the nature of credit spreads in general, the short bear call will not be at full profit to negate the long call loss fast. It does come down to the most obvious point \"it could ping pong and kill both legs.\"\n\n3. No amount of creative stop loss (closing short leg closing long leg etc) would save this because of the \"wide-ish\" bear put spread. Whereas with tighter width, in a swingy day you could potentially stop the short leg and let the long leg profit enough to cover the short leg shortcoming. \n\n4. This needs to be opened now or early morning (I have IBKR and can do so), otherwise there will be no credit in the 2PM.\n\n5. I guess if SPX is stuck in between 4343 and 4360, I could open a short call at 4370, turning this into two bear calls for reduced loss (at that point there will not be profit anymore).\n\nNVM: I have 1 $25 bucks put butterfly centred at 4325 for the sell off protection. Will look at the candles around 2:00 and when he takes the podium."

     "How can one a really add cash into their portfolio with call options? I recently understood that if you buy 1 contract of x company who's share price is $100, that doesn't mean I have bought $1000 worth of shares because upon selling to close my call option if I see that the stock price went up to $120 after noting that the strike price was $99 and premium was $120, I don't make $80 ($200 - $120 = $80), unless I actually buy 100 shares at the strike price. So how am I really making a profit??? Is it all about getting a bid higher than the premium when selling to close my call option? If so, what makes a bid price go higher than the premium I originally paid? And if I am only going to make cash with the bid amount, why is there a need to do technical analysis or any analysis for that matter, plus why do we create such a big hype around options when we never even get to own 100 shares without paying for them?  \nI tried researching but I think an explanation leaning towards the layman type will make more sense!

The reason behind my anticipation of substantial gains or losses is the recent behavior of the stock. If it experiences a sharp decline, I stand to profit; conversely, a significant climb would also be profitable. What are your thoughts on this?

     "Question on PMCC \"Collateral\" \n\nMy strategy is to utilize a PMCC on an ETF (SPY or QQQ) but to sometimes close out my long leg to take profits and find a reentry point if my short leg (usually 30-45 DTE) isn't \"making money\" right away. The problem with this is it leaves my short leg naked for a very brief moment and therefore robinhood (please don't judge) will not let me sell my LEAP for profits since it is considered collateral (I don't own 100 shares either).\r  \n\r  \nSince I don't want to close both legs at the same time so I can let theta do its thing with my short leg, my solution is to purchase an additional call as \"backup\" collateral, way OTM around $0.02 per contract. That way I can freely roll my LEAPS however I want in order to take some profits, with the cheap OTM call acting as my temporary collateral while I reenter with my LEAPS.\r  \n\r  \nMy question is, how stupid is this plan? I've been evaluating the risks of this but want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. I am not concerned about short leg assignment, as I will be actively managing it and rolling it back out before it even gets to expiration."

     "Hi guys, I want to attempt the first quad-witching play! Likely plays XSP and not SPX, but example is given for SPX. \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong...I indicated in the () where I have questions. \n\n1. Suppose that at close today I buy a bear call ladder for a credit. SPX closes at 4410. So I opened a bear call ladder. -439c/441/444 for $110 credit. BEP is therefore >445.10, and <439.90. All expiring on 16/6 AM Expiration. It is clearly indicated on IBKR so I know it's AM.\n\n2. At 10:00 ish tomorrow, they will publish SET (where can I see this? CBOE website?). They will not be based on complicated mathematics with futures and whatnot, but rather just the open price of the SPX composition companies (correct?). \n\n3. Let's say the SET on Friday AM is 4400 (XSP 440). Does this not mean I would lose money regardless where SPX closes? Because my guide is the SET. Why bother keeping the position open then? \n\n4. If 3 is correct/partially correct, well since this is AM expiration, that bear ladder I purchased was really a bet on the opening price (SET). Would they expire right away an hour after SET is published? \n\n5. I think 3 is where I am most wrong... Appreciate the correction."

Will the price of that option drop by $.15 due to theta decay from close of today to open tomorrow?

This is my third 50% dip.  \n2017-2019, 2020, 2022. \n\nI think Macro plays a huge part. \nTSLA is down 25% this 3 months, and flat the last year. \nQQQ is down 16% and 14%\nAMZN is down 31% and 36%\nFB is down 12% and 45%\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of news about Elon this and Elon that.  It\u2019s is 90% noise. I ignore it and focus on the fundamentals. \n\nNegative catalysts. \nTesla Shanghai was shut down for 1.5 months. This will hurt Q2 financials. It\u2019s Teslas highest margin plant. Also the Fed will announce there is a recession on July 28th.  More Elon news will come out. \n\nPositive catalysts\nEvery automaker will sell every EV they make.  Tesla is planning on making the most and have a 1 year backlog on the model Y. I wish the news about Elon would have reduced my wait times it has not. My Feb order planned for Aug has been delayed to November. The delivery reports for tesla are planned for Jan 3rd, Apr 3rd, July 3rd, Oct 3rd.  So Jul 3rd will not be great.  I expect October to be good and Jan to be off the charts with Texas and Berlin to be ramped to 5k per week.  Also Tesla is announcing split. \n\nMy own strategy which is not financial advice. Wait for them to announce the recession on Jul 28. The Q2 financials and Q2 earnings have past. And then mid August buy calls.  \n\nI bought calls last year in June and rode the Q3 and Q4 deliveries and dumped them 800C 6/22. 80k calls sold for 400k. It was pretty sweet. When TSLA doubled the calls 5x. \n\nOf course this is gambling. And the majority of my holdings are in the stock which is investing. \n\nShort term PE is compressing. Long term EPS Cars*ASP 50k, 20% margins:\n2020 ~0 EPS (500k cars built)\n2021 $6 (930k)\n2022 $15 (1.5M: 600k, 800k, 50k, 50k)\n2023 $25 (2.5M: 600k, 1M, 450k, 450k)\n2024 $36 (3.6M: 600k, 1M, 1M, 1M)\nThese estimates are just based on the current factories. In 2024 Shanghai 2, Texas 2 and Berlin 2 Maybe producing cars. Shanghai they bought a second piece of land.  Texas and Berlin have room to expand. 40 PE 2023 = $1000, 40 PE 2024 is $1440. Or use your own PE.  \n\nHappy hunting"

     "Hi. I'm starting to trade SPX and I have some questions to determine my strike prices. Is there any good resource to review historical SPX volatility and major changes over time? I want to determine how likely certain movements might be based on history (ie, how likely is it to change 50, 100, 200, pts over a certain time frame, like a month or whatnot.)\n\nVIX is not helpful for what I'm looking for because it give current volatility and some of the websites I've seen just give historical numbers without the specific I'm looking for - ie, change amount over time period."

Usually it seems like the weeklies some at the same strike, when cumulatively added together, end up being more than the monthly. and if it's far OTM, that gives you time to push the strike further out on a covered call and/or collect higher premium.

I have learned about pin risk and wanted to make sure I am understanding the risks well to make sure I do not blow my account up.\n\nMy understanding is that pin risk would come into play if I hold the spread til expiration and the short (sold) call is assigned. Prior to me being chosen for the assignment risk my long (bought) call expires worthless, and the stock price is very high requiring me to buy 100 shares at X$ above the strike price.In theory I can mitigate this by never holding to expiration. Even if assigned prior to expiration I will have the long (bought) call to act as a buffer. Though it sounds this can be a false sense of security if the spread is held over the weekend and the assignment occurs after hours, and some news comes out that has a negative effect of on the stock price and thus my long (bought) call? It sounds like this risk would still be limited though.\n\nAs another hedge, I shouldn't trade spreads on any stock where I can't afford the value (100 shares x the # of options) of my short (sold) call.\n\nMost of the videos I have watched on this topic seem to be concerned with put credit spreads which makes sense as, if assigned, you'd need to owe the money required for 100 shares at the strike price. Though the risk is still there if the long expires worthless, short is exercised, and stock price goes up dramatically (e.g., Nvidia during earnings)\n\nThank you in advance for any help and knowledge"

I'm struggling to understand how this is still ITM. Additionally, what happens to the put if the price drops further and I decide to execute it?\n\nTIA"

Obviously it's probably advisable to take profit at this point however I am okay with risking this profit I've made if there is reasonable potential for significantly more. If I hold it through earnings and the stock pumps, will I make significantly more gains? I'm new to this and not sure how IV crush and theta decay will affect me.\nI know this whole play is I advised and I understand I'm essentially gambling/playing with money. Thanks"

     "I'd really appreciate if someone can help me figure out wtf is going on with my puts. I'm holding SPY $300 puts expiring in January. Stupid, I know. Anyways...\n\nThe contract closed yesterday at $2.95 per share and it closed at the exact same price today. After hours right now, the bid is showing $2.98 but that's not much of a difference anyway.\n\nSo SPY went down about a half percent today while the VIX went up nearly 3%. So how in the ever loving fuck did my puts remain practically unchanged?!?!\n\nTheta is about -0.026 so I should lose less than 3 cents per share to time decay. Let's just round it up and say 3 cents. Okay, but delta is about -0.062, which if I understand correctly means my contracts should have risen in value by more than 6 cents per dollar that SPY went down. SPY is down 2.33 on the day. Let's round down and say an even 2 bucks down. Which means at a bear minimum my contracts should have closed at least 12 cents higher than yesterday, minus the 3 cents it lost to theta. So the puts should have easily closed at least 9 cents higher than yesterday, or $3.04. \n\nProbably even more than $3.04 though, because notice how I rounded off all the numbers in a disadvantageous direction. Yet even now the bid is $2.98. \n\nI feel like the market maker is literally trying to rob me. What am I missing? How am I misunderstanding this?\n\nPlease and thank you."

For example if i am selling a put- on some underlyings\u2019 the amount is the full amount required to cover- like a csp. On some it is a fraction. I can sell a 30 put on AI for only -315 in buying power! If I sell a 14 on PLTR it\u2019s the full value of the risk. \nEven more interesting is that it\u2019s different on differing platforms.

     "Options in simpler terms: did I get it right?\n\nThe price of an Options contract (i.e., premium) at any given point in time has two components = Intrinsic value + Extrinsic value.\n\nIntrinsic value is the measure of how much profitness that contract is sitting on at that point in time (based on the strike rate and the underlying stock price). Hence the terms - In the Money (ITM), At the Money (ATM), Out of the Money (OTM) etc.\n\nExtrinsic value is the measure of uncertainty surrounding the possible fluctuations of the Intrinsic value depending on the remaining days to expire. Hence, more days to expiry means more chances for the underlying stock price to go up or down. Thereby, higher price for that contract. So, as an Options contract nears expiry, the extrinsic value component lowers since not much time left to have price fluctuation in the underlying stock. And if the contract is already in OTM, then it'll be worthless on the expiration date.\n\nDid I get it right?"

From what I've gathered online, InteractiveBrokers does offer this, but it seems like you might need around 100k to comfortably trade options there. I'm not entirely sure, but that's the figure that keeps popping up, which is a bit more than what I'm able to work with.  \nI looked into DEGIRO too, but they only provide trading in US index options, not equity ones.  \nSo, does anyone know a broker that's more suited to someone with a smaller liquid fund but still lets you trade US equity options?"

I had been considering indicators as mostly \"accurate for short-term only\" at best or \"overthinking to death\"... \n\nIn general you want to create/respect signals for which you can enter for long or sell/short-sell. But what about for credit spreads? Credit spreads don't mature/pop as quickly as a single long option. At what point do you TA-ers enter credit spreads, and at what point do you exit? I was thinking if you want to see TA, you can see the signal if the day is likely bullish/bearish, to then sell a credit spread at 5-10delta. You either would keep to your conviction, or sell at a certain stop gap based on the indicators of your choice. \n\nI just cannot imagine the latter being that profitable given how these indicators like MACD, VWAP cross over multiple times in a day for credit spreads and other theta play.\n\nETA:\n\nEx: Had I opened 1 x 400c NVDA on Friday open because a certain pattern indicates bullish day, I would have probably made 30% for the first 5 minutes, until I see the MACD reverses and SMA/VWAP swaps (common signal for reversal).\n\nOn the other hand, had I sold 1x 395/-400c for let's say 1:1 risk/reward 250 credit, then this probably would have barely made $20 around the same time frame because the short leg would have still carried some theta/extrinsics. \n\nI suppose you could have opened 1000 of 395/-400c respecting stop loss/stop price, so that you would still acquire respectable profits... but let me hear from you!"

Once it drops below buy a call option for SPY about 30 days out with a delta around .5.\nWhen looking at charts if I'm looking at weekly, VXX just dropped below its 10 day moving average while 1 month it's just above and 3 months it's about to cross above.

I was thinking about rolling the put side up to create a short box spread. This would grant a very good premium. This would lock in the max (750 per contract - call und put spreads premium). Would be a smaller loss than selling the call spread now.\n\nobviously I should have closed the positions earlier which was my mistake. Any thoughts on the defensive adjustments?

     "You could do a pairs trade maybe? This is where have a long position (real or synthetic) in one stock, and a short in the other. Here's how it could work.\n\nLet's assume that ABC and XYZ have a strong correlation such that XYZ is usually $10 less than ABC. And right now, the stocks are only $X apart, where X is some number other than 10. To profit here, you would go long on one symbol and go short on the other. Your expectation is that at some point, *relative to each other*, one will gain value and the other will lose value. It doesn't really matter what their current prices are, or even what their prices will end up being in the future, as long as the stocks *trend towards* that $10 difference.\n\nLet's use actual numbers to illustrate:\n\nScenario 1: ABC now is $100. XYZ is now $97. Go long ABC, short XYZ.\n\n* Scenario 1-A: ABC later is at 130. XYZ is at 120. Your long stock has gained $30. The short stock has lost $23. Total profit is $7.\n\n* Scenario 1-B: ABC is later at $80. XYZ is at $70. Long stock in ABC has lost you $20. Short stock in XYZ has gained you $27. Net gain is (again) $7.\n\nScenario 2: ABC is currently at $100, XYZ is at $85. Now go long XYZ and short ABC.\n\n* Scenario 2-A: ABC laters goes to $120, XYZ to $110. ABC has lost you $20 and XYZ has gained $25. Net gain is $5.\n\n* Scenario 2-B: ABC later goes to $50, XYZ to $40. ABC has gained you $50, XYZ has lost you $45. Net gain is $5.\n\nThe upside here is that this doesn't rely on a bear market or a bull market. Up, down, doesn't matter. All you care about is that correlation to correct the prices relative to each other.\n\nThis gets a bit harder to apply when the relationship isn't a fixed dollar amount, but a ratio instead. You would need to change the amount of shares/contracts in one position or the other.\n\ntl;dr if you believe in the correlation and the correlation is currently out of alignment, short one side and long the other to profit off of the correction of that correlation."

     "Ok, this is a stupid question. I just did my first option trade a few weeks ago really just to make sure I had the procedure down correctly. I made a spread selling a put on NVDA at 245 and buying a put at 220, both with the strike date of May 26. This gave me a net credit so I am hoping these will expire worthless and I can keep the premium. I plan on closing the trade, probably next week before the earnings report on May 24. I will close by buying back the 245 put. My question is what do I do with the 220 put I bought for insurance. Do I just sell it after I buy back the 245 put?"

     "So I\u2019m learning about covered calls and to me it seems like a free money generator. Someone please let me know where the secret risk is that I\u2019m not seeing.\n\nSay I own 100 shares of SPY, which I want to continue holding. I write a covered call for them and if the market drops I keep the premium, if the market goes up but stays below strike I keep the premium as well as benefit from the increased value of the underlying, and if it passes the strike I take max profit. The market taking a downturn is obviously a risk but if I intend to own the SPY anyway and not sell during a downturn, I seem to take on no additional risk.\n\nAs far as I understand it, pin risk is not applicable as I already have the shares in my account. If the option holder exercises after close, whatever my shares get called away and I just buy them back close to the strike. \n\nAdditional money with no additional risk, what am I missing? TIA"

     "Hi, I trade shares normally and don't fully grasp options (as will be clear here in a moment). I was talked into a credit spread on AAPL earnings last week. \n\nlong May 12 145c @ $21.13\n\nshort May 12 143c @ $23.08\n\nfor a net credit of $195. i tried to get 10 of these, only got filled on 2. so a credit of $390. I was under the impression I had a max loss of $5 per spread. \n\nThis morning I was looking to short AAPL shares near open. My PNL and position size on AAPL were 0. When I entered suddenly i was short 200 more shares that I should have been and my PNL was -6000. I sort of freaked obviously, and after letting the stock dip a bit I flattened the position. filled at 173.20. \n\nObviously I had been assigned the short side of the spread, something I wasn't aware was possible. So I checked the long calls, and they were hovering around $28, but AAPL was clearly headed down and I didn't want them to lose anymore, so i sold them got $5611 for them. After crunching all the numbers it appears I only lost $39, so i guess a cheap lesson. \n\nMy question is really, what should I have done? If I hadn't traded apple and left those shares short, would the long calls of been assigned covering the short position and keeping my max loss the same? \n\nand having already covered that short position was I correct to get out of the long calls ASAP before they lost more value? \n\nThanks."

Obviously, I'd like to start making returns sooner than 3 years, so I have started looking into options. I've watched a ton of youtube videos, but something I have noticed is that a **LOT** of people never explain **WHY** they made certain trades. They say \"I thought SPY was going to go down and so I bought a PUT and made over $3,000 in a day\" without ever explaining what it was that made them believe SPY was going down. These videos never actually explain the thinking behind why they believe something was going to happen. I get that tech ETFs are volatile and all, but what is the reasoning behind hourly or daily options? What are good signs, bad signs, or anything in between?"

They recommended I put in a limit order for $2.50 instead, which naturally didn't get filled because it didn't take the bid-ask spreads into account. Am I crazy for thinking you should be able to place a limit order for any price \"near\" current market price?\n\nThe app also showed a larger reduction in buying power (4k) than the trade price (~1k). That's incorrect too, right? The reduction in buying power should be the cost of the trade? It's essentially a debit spread even if it's the result of me unwinding a pretty unfortunate trade (which should eventually have increased my buying power, but for the system to tell me that seems to be a big ask by now)"

     "Elon's ability to keep the hype train rolling is 2nd to none.  Take a look at what happened when Dr. Burry, the king of brass balls and short positions, announced his short position in $TSLA.  Dr. Burry lays out a very reasonable and encouraging message to Elon to issue shares and take profits to cement Tesla's existence.  He even used an email from Elon where he himself admits that the stock price is not based in real value.  In response Elon essentially jingled some keys by announcing a massive Bitcoin position.  I'm guessing he has dozens of such distractions ready to go since the entire existing electricity model can be improved by leaps and bounds.  Not to mention you can electrify new things like boats, ships, bikes, boards, flight, etc. Each of these would serve as fuel for the hype train.  Also there was the flame thrower...\n\nTLDR:  It's Dr. Burry's brass balls VS Elon's long shlong."

In the US there is no equal competition. BMW, Porsche, Audi future cars are all priced above $50k and some are north of $100k. Tesla dropping their prices make them more affordable for the masses. What also needs to be considered is the technology inside a Tesla as well as Elon\u2019s future projects and how they will integrate with cars.

Tesla has (and imo always will be) the upper-class, luxury EV with advanced tech. I don't think competition from vehicles like the Nissan Leaf or even the Audi e-Tron (which is totally sick) will undercut Tesla's market share. Essentially, the Venn diagram of Tesla consumers and Chevy Bolt consumers is 2 circles. \n\nMore people buying EVs will always mean more Tesla owners (and more EV subsidies), no matter how you spin it."

If you buy a single put option with 815 strike, that option will cost you $59.90 right now so your break even is that you need Tesla under $755 to make money. If you buy a single option, you want to be directionally certain of the direction of the move. \n\nInstead - do a spread to lower your risk. Buy the 815 strike Put (costs $60) // Sell the 750 strike (pays $34.50) for $25.55 net debit and max profit of $49.45 per contract if Tesla drops to $750 or lower. \n\nOf course, if you REALLY know that Tesla is going to drop, then go right ahead and buy the single Put option at full price and ignore the spread. But if really knew that Tesla was going one direction or another you would not be new to options and you be minted already. So take the safer bet - the put spread. Way cheaper if you are wrong."

The premiums and TSLA\u2019s big movements will net you good gains on a smaller buy, you\u2019ll basically just have to wait for a slight bounce up so you don\u2019t overpay or get IV crush, which will probably happen this week.

As long as you choose solid names so that if you get exercised you're protected, you'll be good.  I also use a hybrid where I sometimes sell put credit spreads (very solid names).  \n\nReading your comment and based on the deltas of your straddle, you are assuming more upside for the market which is my bias as well.  Selling puts or theta strategies however don't allow that upside gain as our returns are more or less fixed.  The strangle is an interesting idea.  Personally, I am considering a call roll strategy where I go 30 days out and get at the monies.  This will give me the upside I need to keep up with the market while the puts will continue to print.  That being said, I should probably investigate methods to hedge my downside just in case.\n\nWhat do you guys think though, strangle to pad the stats or call roll?  I'm curious.\n\nAlso, I am using a bigger portfolio"

If your a pro, how is it living this lifestyle? \n\nIf you were self-taught, are there any specific resources or courses that you found particularly helpful when learning about the market? I'm more of a structured person and would really like to follow a program instead of being overwhelmed by the multitude of videos and information on YouTube.\n\nSpecifically I\u2019m interested in learning more about options strategies, and how to swing trade. I have a good understanding of trading options, and would like to eventually use the wheel strategy when I have enough capital to start selling cash secured puts. (I'm not too far off) As far as swing trading goes, I have a general understanding of it, but i\u2019m overwhelmed by the many factors like technical analysis of charts, indicators, and other aspects of analysis that go into making decisions.\n\nLastly, I\u2019m Eager to know how long it took you to become a proficient and comfortable trader. \n\nJust so you guys understand my goals I currently have a full-time job that I love and want to keep, but I'm looking to create additional income as a trader.

My life savings are being destroyed right in front of my eyes in a matter of hours.\\n\\nPlease be very cautious and dont break your own rules. You dont want to experience such unnecessary soul crushing event irl.\\n\\nEdit:\\nGuys, I can't express how heart-warming it is to read all those uplifting comments from you. I'm beyond grateful for this. You really put a seed of hope in my soul that I can and will recover from this and it might not take as many years as I fear.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nAs of now I'm going to hold my position till lunch time and see how everything goes, because my puts already almost worthle\"",

     "u/reallytastybanana have you considered converting part of your position into a strangle? That would be selling a fraction and selling OTM calls. I'm thinking ballpark 20% of your current position and converting to calls.\n\nSecondly, perhaps consider converting some of your puts into credit  spreads by selling puts in front of them.\n\nThird, consider selling 10% or 20% at a relatively extreme loss before going into expiry where it'll be worse.\n\nThis is perhaps an extreme exercise in position repair. Some of your long puts are lottery tickets for a big price drop, so I'd hang on to some of them.\n\nWith the above, if the price pops up you'll recoup some losses from the OTM calls. If the price stays neutral, you'll gain from having sold puts and you can feel good about watching puts lose value.  If the price drops, then your remaining long puts will gain some of their value back. In any case you won't be back to 100%, but hopefully your losses will have been buffered and not as extreme.\n\nTake care above else, your mental health is paramount. Money is only worth so much, often less than we would think."

What I did was equally as risky. \n\nStill, I never buy puts on tesla :/\n\nBut dude, if weeklies are stressing you out that much, to the point where you need meds to sleep, then you need to not trade risky FDs.

     "I applaud your mental strength to share and admit your story here! Everyone drums up when they win but keep low when they loose, and I commend you for your courage by sharing your caution with everyone here! \n\nBe safe and know this will soon pass! It will be just another veteran style story you will be telling years from now. I invite you to consider this a expensive yet valuable lesson that will actually help you be richer if you allow this to be a lesson and not give up investing all together ! This lesson is that of risk management behind every stock market decision you make. Most of us believe that it is the good trading and analysis skills that leads to more money, but lot of people already have successful trades here and there, but the fact is you will bring in the most money in with your other silent skill - risk management. It looks counterintuitive but you don\u2019t make long term money from your trading skill but you make more money with your skill for risk consideration before you make any step.  This is why I say it\u2019s a valuable lesson for you. \n\nIt takes hard lesson to be a hero and it\u2019s yours, flount it and use it properly to riches. Remember Warren Buffet also learned such a similar hard lesson (it happened to him with his very first stock purchase). Don\u2019t stop investing you\u2019ve learned lessons and you will quickly be on your way to riches as you collect more experiences up your sleeve. Remember at the end of the day money is less fun compared to the this fun of art of making money! Keep moving on, cheers champ!"

That loss triggered something within them and they came roaring back.

Sometimes we all lose, be grateful you are still alive, If you are under 40, you still have more than half of your life in front of you. Think about Warren Buffet, he has 100 billion, but I bet that he would give 99 billion to be 50 again. Your time on earth can't be measured in dollars. You can earn infinitely, but you can't live infinitely. Don't look at your account, it's gone anyways. Cry, meditate (helped me a lot), and get back on your feet. You will be back on top sooner than you think. If you have a wife cool, have sex with her, if not, go out with some females, will help a lot, and they will care less than you think about your loss. You will find out that you are the only guy that cares about your losses, your friends, family, will forget the day after.

Literally everything pointed towards TSLA being bullish.  \n\nI almost never buy straight calls but in this case I did (I also did call debit spreads) because it was too good of a setup on a stock like this to pass up.\n\nWhat was it about TSLA that made you decide to get Puts? \n\nAgain, if it\u2019s too upsetting then no need to answer, not trying to make anything worse.  But if you\u2019re willing to discuss perhaps you can figure out how not to do it again?\n\nEDIT : I read the other comments and see what happened.

Before the split simple options priced $3000 still had like 30,000 in volume so thats like $90mil usd worth of power being exchanged in that strike price alone. Now with the stock split, those options priced at only $300 and volume is still 30,000 (lets be real, its all bots & automated) so thats only like $9m worth of money being exchanged vs the previous $90m.\\n\\nI see options expiring 9/2 are still pretty expensive $600-800 so Ill have to study what happens a bit more but I still dont quite see it matching the insanity we had before or am I wrong?\\n\\nAre the good days of TSLA options over?

I kept the contract with the hope of exercising it as I was /still am interested in TSLA accumulation for the long term. That contract is now worth 87.50. When I called Fidelity asking about exercising they said that I will have to pay 13K to exercise it and will not get to keep the gains from the contract, is this true? I was under the assumption that I will lose the 26.40 which will go to the option seller and I get to keep the  61.1 that the option has profited (which I had hoped to use towards the 13K which I will eventually need to exercise it). Also, If I exercise it, what will be the purchase dates of the shares that I exercise (will it be the date of exercise or the date I bought the contract?) \\n\\nAppreciate any helpful guidance with the above or is there any other better way to profit from the ballooned up contract price.'",

     "It's a contract enabling you to buy 100 shares of TSLA at $130 per share.  It's currently worth 87.50 per share (or, $8750.)  If you exercised it, why would you get $6110?  Exercising it means buying 100 shares of TSLA at $130 per share.  That means giving your brokerage $13,000, and they give you 100 shares of TSLA.  That's it.\n\nImagine you bought a coupon saying \"1 bottle of Tide for $15\" for $5.  Then you go to Walmart, and someone standing outside says \"hey, I'll give you $12 for that coupon.\" You ignore him, go into Walmart, and use the coupon.  Using the coupon means you give the cashier $15 plus the coupon, and they give you 1 bottle of Tide.  They keep the coupon.  They don't give you $7 just because the guy outside was willing to buy the coupon from you for $12.\n\nWhat you're also ignoring is that it's better to sell the call and buy the shares on the open market.  TSLA closed at 217.61.  That means the call is ITM by 87.61.  87.50 is the bid, and 88.40 is the ask.  The last is 88.00.  Which means you probably could have sold it at market close for more than 87.61, which means you'd save money selling it and buying the shares on the open market instead of exercising."

     "Take an example :\n\nTake a 45 days out cash secured put on TLT . TLT July 21 99/95 credit spread will give you around $102. That means, say if you repeat the trade for say 1000 times, you Win 700 times. For calculation sake, let\u2019s say 7 wins on 10 attempts. That means you make 102*7 = $714. While the 3 losses will set you back by 400*3= 1200.\n\nSo for 10 trades, you will most likely make a loss of 1200-714= $486. This proved to you that selling credit spread Dillon TLT right now is not a good bet. To make your you are net profitable you need to select a trade where the probability of making profits over a long period of time is more than the probability of you loosing full amount. \n\nYou can further optimize it by cutting of all trades at 100% loss (I.e if the premium you collected is $102, close the trade if the value of credit spread goes above $204). This will reduce your probability further but will help you avoid max loss. \n\nYou can further optimize it using technicals and based on whether IV is high or not.\n\nBut bottom line: Just because you get $100 premium in a trade, you are not going to make $10,000 in 100 such trades. You might realistically plan for say $2000(i.e $20 per trade). Anything more would be your skills or luck.\n\nCash secured puts and wheel strategy might perform better."

     "The most profitable way to capitalize on the option would be to sell the option. That\u2019s what you do. It would be the same profit basically, but eventually you could exercise the option, since you are long TSLA, but you\u2019d have to have enough capital to purchase 100 shares of TSLA at $703 each.  You\u2019re up 63% on it right now which is great. Some would sell now or already have grabbed their profits and sold. So that\u2019s up to you to decide, and of course we don\u2019t know what will happen to the market and TSLA between now and January so it could do worse. You also have to eventually worry about Theta, time decay as you get closer to your expiration date. So TL;DR, you buy the options to sell them for profit generally speaking. Deciding when you think that is most profitable is the next big decision to make, but congrats on being nicely ITM."

     "Hello all I\u2019m a newer trader, been trying to get familiar with options trading the last half year. Now Im very aware theres still a whole lot more to learn a whole hell of a lot more so thats why Im here with this question. So earlier this week on Monday, I came across the stock $Muln/Mullen on and saw a lot of buzz and well the price was very cheap (like $0.07 at the time) and I had small cash to spare. So on Robinhood I purchased some shares and some call contracts for a strike price of $0.5 with the expiration date of May 19th, 2023.\nThen, later this week they announced they were doing reverse split of 1:25, and I didnt fully understand what that meant for me other than seeing that the shares I had turned into a fraction of what I had before and the price of Mullen then went up to $1.50. The call option is still there so my question is what will happen to it now?"

     "Hi folks,\n\nAs I\u2019m doing my first steps with options trading, there are some points I couldn\u2019t figure out with Iron Condor. I understand that max profit is taken when it expires in the range of the short legs, and max loss is occurring when it expires outside the range of the long legs. But the things I don\u2019t understand are:\n\n1. As IC consists multiple legs and potentially multiple buyers/sellers on the other side, is it possible that some/all the legs will get early assignment in different times before the expiration date, thus discomposing my setup?\n2. In case it expires in the money, how exactly max loss occurs? Doesn\u2019t it convert into short position of the underline stock/ETF?\n\nHopefully I was clear enough.."

     "Help understanding what happened here?\n\nI'm new to trading options and set up some low risk trades to get my head around things (well, high risk options but where I'm prepared /expecting them to expire worthless) while I build up a better understanding.\n\nI purchased 2 OOTM call contacts on Credit Suisse, with a Jan 2024 expiry, based on the thesis that the banks as a whole overcorrected and will improve as the general market improves.\n\nI was down a bit generally on the calls as Credit Suisse continued to trade down beyond my predicted floor, but no biggie I thought, I have a year for it to recover. So I was pleased today when I checked the market as Credit Suisse was up 5%. I opened up my brokerage app expecting to see a bit of improvement in the value of my contracts but found the opposite.\n\nCredit Suisse up 5%, my options down -20%.\n\nI'm not upset, this is exactly the kind of learning I wanted to do with those first few purchases, but it's clearly shown I have a gap in my understanding.\n\nNow, I expected some IV crush as we approached the strike date, but these contracts are barely opened so I thought I'd have some runway? And the contacts held their value over the last week when the stock has been trading down, but dropped massively on the day the stock started trading back up?\n\nAny advice or enlightenment would be much appreciated!"

     "I agree that the earnings report was very good for Tesla, but I disagree with a lot of your assumptions or opinions at the end. \n\n1.  To say that this means all the talk about Lucid or Nio not being competition is a little short-sighted.  For one, Lucid will just now be delivering products to consumers in this upcoming quarter, so we can\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a better product or not until we see it.  Nio for their part is actually doing quite well in China which poses a threat to Tesla\u2019s ambition in trying to gain market share there.  Let\u2019s not forget the fiasco surrounding Chinese customers not happy about the QC in their newly delivered Model 3s.  And with the Chinese government basically saying Tesla spies on Chinese citizens, this could have an impact on sales in the region.  If Nio is able to expand production and penetrate markets beyond Asia, they may indeed be a force to be reckoned with.  And let\u2019s not forget Rivian, GMs electric push, Toyota entering the space next year, and the success of Hyundai/Kia.\n\n2. You mentioned Tesla AI being an attractive feature for the future of autonomous driving, but you failed to mention that Tesla believes in going all in on just using cameras for their autonomous system. This is a HUGE problem as the cameras are only reliable in certain weather conditions and there is no fail safe in place when the system fails.  Why do you think every other major car manufacturer and autonomous driving companies use a host of sensors including LiDAR?  It\u2019s because autonomous driving is only as good as the ability of the system to gain as much information as possible from the environment and be able to process that data.  Not to mention engineering redundancy is a great way to have a fail safe measure in case something happens.  If camera 23 goes bad or no longer functions properly (which camera failures happen in cars a lot), then the LiDAR is able to provide a fail safe to pick up where that camera left off.  Is there a glare preventing camera 11 from capturing data? No worries, the sensors can provide information where that camera can\u2019t. Which brings me to my last point\u2026\n\n3. Tesla is great because of Elon but it also has many shortcomings because of Elon\u2019s ego.  In fact, if Tesla were to fail tomorrow it\u2019s most likely because his ego got in the way.  This is what keeps some investors weary of the company.  Elon said he thought LiDAR was dumb technology that wasn\u2019t needed and is doubling down on cameras only as the solution.  The biggest complaint in the new Plaid models is the steering wheel, with even Marques Brownlee saying it would be a great car except for this and yet Elon Musk is doubling down saying he won\u2019t offer any other type of wheel.  It\u2019s Elon\u2019s ego that can end up being the downfall of the company.  And that\u2019s something investors have to be mindful about."

Elon did not sound optimistic about anything, he kept telling us why things were taking time vs telling us when things were going to finish. \n2. He wavered on next year growth between 50 and 100%, this is telling me that he thinks they'll get delivering new cars out of the new factors in Q2 next year or late Q1. \n3. We won't get to 1M vehicles this year, not that we have to, but about 830-850k inline with analysts. \n4. FSD isn't ready and he didn't hype it at all. \n5. Subscriptions were a bust as he didn't hype it, he eve said \"at this point the value proposition on subscriptions are so-so, we need to get FSD done\". Doesn't sound we see the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nI think 2021 is going to be pretty sideways for the stock, it reminds me of the 2018 when we knew that China was going to open and we were looking for the 5k per week number and went through production hell, then came out the other side of it. At that point the stock started rallying, once Tesla got some scale. \n\nWe are going through that again, but this time with 2 factories, an entirely new way of building cars, with brand new battery chemistry, with brand new ways to install the batteries in the cars with brand new factors in brand new places and during a chip shortage. \n\nSo this earnings call asked for patience and we'll give Tesla as much time as they need, its super hard to do what they are doing and we ask too much too soon. \n\nMy opinion is that the stock will just hang around until we see some clarity and results like in 2018, so a great time to buy more! Every month just buy more."

IV is used because it sort of summarizes all those variables and allows you to assess (imply) the relative price of different options.  A higher IV simply means a higher relative \u201cprice\u201d for those options. It can also be thought of as a market price. \n\nHistorical volatility is the actual measured variability of the stock.  \n\nSo if IV is higher than HV, it just means that options are expensive given the history of the stock.  If you were to buy options, you would be assuming that the stock is going to be more volatile going forward.  In that way, it is forward looking.  \n\nSo, when options are being bought as hedges because there is more \u201cfear\u201d in the market, it forces option prices upward and therefore IV increases, which is why VIX is a measure of fear in the market."

A low iv percentile doesn't mean stock prices will change a lot. It means option prices are low, and therefor taking a long position might be warren Ted (assuming a rise in volatility) \n\nThe opposite is also true when iv is high you might want to sell options because prices are high and you assume a drop in volatility. \n\nHowever this is antithetical to how the market views that stock at that moment, because high iv means the market expects high volatility.

     "Tesla is a piggy bank for Billionaires. They have more power than retail investors. The fundamentals of the company suck dog dick. If investors would put their money in F or GM or VWAGY those stocks would rise from a percentage standpoint way more than Tesla can given it's sky high valuation. But I guess it's a more solid investment to buy a company that trades at over 900 times earnings. Not that I have anything against Elon but it would be nice to see him build something that people actually want like high speed railways like they have in France and that backward country known as China. Remember the \"Hyperloop\" idea, it seems to have turned out to be all hype and no loop. In the mean time he continues to play with his space toys and invest billions into giving billionaires a chance to orbit the earth. I like his fuel cell technology and that could be a meaningful investment in the human condition. By now he could have outfitted the entire state of Texas with affordable backup generators but the fact is Elon really doesn't give a fuck about regular people."

     "There is an old expression on the street - buy the reviews and sell the news . Out of the last 45 earnings reports , 39 of them went down the day after they\u2019ve\u201d crushed earnings\u201d . Why? \n\nBecause they are reporting on the quarter gone by not what lies ahead. It is the governance that dictates the earnings report, unfortunately that is based on the number coming first - first they tell you what happened then they tell you what to expect . My strategy , which has worked very well, has been first to play a short term call  2-3 days ahead along with a cash covered put same equity slightly shorter duration. Equity does a run up ahead of earnings - I close my profitable call, take my cash covered put  premium - profit in both sides . Right before earnings around 3:00 before post market announcement , I take a long put sane equity hold for 2-3 days it drops right into the money I sell. A week later you revisit - most get a bounce up after the information is observed two weeks later . \n\nIt\u2019s a very good way to play earnings - Snap didn\u2019t go that way for the first time in a long time . Try this strategy ahead of earnings this  week you will do well - it t has a high win rate."

This also results in stock price going down. \n\n(4) Revenue and Gross margins might be good enough but SG&A is still high, stock price could correct.\n\n(5) Synergies promised during M&A fail to materialize as per the original time line. \n\n(6) Business could be cyclical with high PE when there is a trough and low P/E at the peak. \n\nIndustry specific -\n\n (Pharma) - loss of patent protection, pricing power pressure from generics competition, pipeline setbacks, rise in debt due to financing of M&A activity.\n\n(Financials) - Lower Net Interest Margins (due to low FED funds rate), Increase in loan provisions for losses due to deteriorating credit metrics, Increase in non-interest operating expenses, Poor loan growth.\n\nGood Luck to all!"

     ">I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down.\n\nHere Is 1 way to look at how options work.\n\nSelling OTM calls or puts is a game of over/under.\n\nYou think the price will move down then you sell an otm call (cc or spread).  You are playing that the price will stay \"under\" the strike sold.\n\n\nIf you think the price will move up then you sell a put, playing that the price will stay \"over\" the strike sold.\n\n\nBy selling OTM you give yourself a margin of error, where you can be a little wrong about the direction and still win the game.\n\n\nIf you are not sure about the direction, but think that the price will make a move, then you can play \"outside da box\" by selling a butterfly or a Condor (Condor, not an iron condor)\n\nBoth of these create a lower and upper level of the box, while time (date of entry and expiration) creates the sides.   You are playing that the price will move out of that box before it expires.\n\n\nIMHO European style options work best for the outside da box strategy because they do not have early exercise risk, so this let's you play the index options (NDX, SPX/XSP, RUT/MRUT, and DJX)"

     "Reading examples on how to sell a covered call and it seems straight forward. In the latest example I have read - own 100 shares @$45 and sell a covered call for a month out at a strike price of $50 and collect a $100 premium, if it expires under $50 you keep the premium and if it hits the strike price it gets assigned and you make the $500 profit and keep the $100. Sounds GREAT !!! sign me up,\n\nWhen I try to apply this to stocks I already own the numbers just don't work. Not even getting close to these kinds of possibilities. What am I missing ? Are the numbers they give in this example just way to unrealistic to happen in most cases ?"

Risk is up to the individual but should I cut and run at this point? (Would you?)\n3.) When closing the position I am confused on the best way to go about it.

     "New trader here and had great success in March/April just selling some basic spreads and getting used to the mechanics in small dollar amounts.  I'm about 20 trades in (all profitable!) and just had my first short leg challenged and so it was my first time making an adjustment. \n\nIWM put credit spread for May 5, 2023 expiry with 172/170 strike price for an original credit of $32.  Trade moved against me this week, so yesterday when it was about 1% out of the money with the short side showing a delta of 0.35 or so, I decided to make an adjustment by putting a call credit spread on to make it an iron condor.  Sold a far OTM 181/183 call credit spread for $28 premium (which is currently quite profitable). \n\nToday, IWM continues to go down and we breach the strike with a current market price of $171.34.  I roll the position by one week to May 12th for a $0.00 net to give it a bit more time to recover.  I believe most traders will only roll if they receive a net credit.\n\nQuestion - did I ever overadjust here by doing both the IC and the roll?  Would you have just closed the position?  In retrospect, as the stock continues to go down, I think rolling without a credit was a mistake."

     "\\-- Handling a short call spread when the stock price jumps to the short leg strike and goes sideways --\n\nIf you had known the future of META last week, how would you have handled this short call spread that expired on Friday 28th? I watched the price of META hover around the short leg for two days, and I'm not sure what I should have done.\n\nMETA short call spread\n\nFilled April 21\n\nBuy META US$245 Call 28/04 - 2 contracts at US$1.16\n\nSell META US$240 Call 28/04 - 2 contracts at US$1.66\n\nCredit: US$100\n\nAfter earnings last week, on the 27th, META shot up from $209 to $240 and hovered between $238 - $242 for the rest of the week. In the last ten minutes of trading of trading on Friday 28th, which was the expiration, META jumped from $238.12 to $240.32. META, but quickly assumed a $239 handle in after hours, where it remains.\n\nI held out until Thursday (27th) afternoon, with META on a bounce at $241.21, and closed the position with a cost of $360.\n\nIf I had known this future pricing, what should I have done?\n\nI wonder,\n\nIf had let this expire, would I have won or lost, considering META  immediately corrected below the short leg after hours? Is it ok to let a spread expire in the money? Is all this moot because you should close any position as soon as it even nears the short leg? Was it risky to hold a spread in the money for most of the day?\n\nI know I shouldn't have held this before earnings. Tuition paid.Thanks for any thoughts. Futures markets are fascinating and I'm keen  to see how to manage such a thing."

The OTM call expires OTM and you keep the premium, and your ITM calls\n\nThing B. The OTM call expires ITM and you then automatically buy shares at $3, then sell them at $5.   \n\n\nSo you keep the premium and the price difference between $3 and $5 share prices, minus what you paid for the ITM call correct?"

You could sell it for a $4 gain.  Or, you could sell at $7 call for at least $3 plus premium.  This means if price expires at $10, you would make little more compared to if you had sold for $10.  Of course, if price keeps going up you won't make as much as if you had held.

This seems like a way to lower your price no matter what happens, they can't both be ITM, so you can, if the put expires ITM, either get more shares with someone else'e money (marginally paid for with the covered call) or if the call expires ITM, sell your shares AND keep the money from the put.

Just painful watching it chop, until yesterday where it finally made a 1% move that really took a hit on.

Impulsive move. \n\nOracle has pivoted into cloud software and integrated multi cloud enterprise usage. 98% of companies now conduct themselves this way. Not a good reason to put .\n\nIt\u2019s at 107 today you need 100 to be at the money \n\nThe underlying equity is on the move right now - they don\u2019t make big swings on earnings but enough to mess up your trade . \n\nSell this trade it\u2019s too iffy , Theta ticking , you bought on a Friday so you already lost a weekend plus - NEVER buy an option  on a Friday . \n\nIt\u2019s at 107 today 107.40 after hours . You have time but , if they get a good or decent earnings , ( Jeffries just gave them an upgrade) you might find yourself at 112 trying to get under 100. The trade moved the wrong way already - cut and run . \n\n\u201c either you take care of the business or the business takes  care of you\u201d \n\nTony Soprano\n\n\nRemember the golden rules from Wall Street \n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t like losses, sport. Nothing ruins my day more than losses.\u201d\n\nSay you had to average a gain of $1,000 a day to make budget. If you lose $1,000 one day, then you have to make $3,000 the next day just to get back on track. That requires you to take on more risk than what might suit your trading style, leaving you more vulnerable to bigger losses.\n\nBeing \u201cpatient,\u201d until the market does what it\u2019s \u201csupposed\u201d to do, often doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s better to cut and start over, than let losses ride.\n\nAnd the idea that you have to be \u201cin it to win it\u201d is for suckers who haven\u2019t learned that it\u2019s better to be square \u2014 have no position \u2014 than to stay in for no other reason.\n\n.\u201cFirst lesson in business is: Don\u2019t get emotional about stock, clouds your judgement.\u201d\n\nEasier said than done, but this might be the quote that rings the most true, and about more than just the financial markets.\n\nWhen analyzing the decisions that led to losses, I found most of them were suffered after the trade was entered. And behind most bad decisions was some form of emotion; in most cases, the emotion was pride.\n\nBeing too stubborn to cut a position, not wanting to be criticized for potentially buying at the high or selling at the low, taking profit/cutting a loss too early, wanting to show everyone else that they were wrong, etc., were among the emotions behind many bad decisions.\n\n\n\nGordon Gekko"

The ask may be .60 and I put in a limit for .80.  Occasionally, it may shoot up to .80 as I am the only one offering to sell shares before diving back down because of another orders. This limit order may stay up all day before getting filled at the end by someone looking to gobble up a bunch at whatever reasonable price they can.  I traded 3 REIT calls this way once and came out $60 higher despite the stock price and the options prices not moving for 3 weeks.

So, by definition, if price drops, with other factors unchanged (or changed in the other direction), iv must crush too. As u/spxbull  said, deltaPNL and vega PNL explain the price drops pretty accurately.\n\nSo the question is, why price drops. While I also see cases mentioned by u/Ideal_Pancake, but clearly it is not the case here, because 1. as you mentioned, both bid and ask drop, 2. they actually got filled, a lot 3. it has a large oi, so pretty liquid.\n\nThe reason any price drops is because more people are selling, no difference here.

This depends on your margin.\n\nThis option costs around 17,500 USD for strike 960 USD and with very large spread. Break even is at 1,135 USD.

At current price level a strike of 520 USD (one standard deviation away) and expiration date of June 17th you would earn about 1,750 USD.

     "Hey guys, I am pretty new here so I can\u2019t post but I want to ask about how I lost money on my Netflix strangle with a huge price drop after the earning call.\n\nSo I bought 500 put and 600 call on 4/20 when Netflix stock price was 550. 500 put costs 2.42 and 600 call costs 3.5 with expiration date 4/23. During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. \n\nNext day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.\n\nFrom my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.\n\nI consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?"

     "Tesla has to start delivering product. Good Quality Product. Elon knows it's only a matter of time before people start to go: \"Hey, why is Tesla so high, but they only make 100,000 cars a year? Where's my ROI? Shouldn't I be getting sweet dividends if it's this pricy? Where's the truck? Where's the Semi? Where's Roadster2?\" Because of the high value, Tesla is finally in a position of financial comfort. This has fortunately killed off most of the shorts. But if the stock goes down to an area that other car makers occupy $50-100 all that \"free money\" disappears. So currently Musk is doing what he always does when he gets in a pinch. Try to distract. \"Hey look! We're playing with bitcoin! Lolz!\" You've noticed that the stock isn't shooting up like a meteor right? So as long as it trades sideways it's fine. But if people start selling to get their money back - that's when there will be a problem. This is why Berlin and Texas are being built with all speed possible - taking the cash and putting it toward production, if they can get production volume higher that will secure the business because then they can go: \"Well we are making Semis and Trucks in Texas, Model 3, Y and S in Berlin, Model 3 & Y in China, Model S, and 3 in Nevada). This is also why he's asked Biden for a carbon tax, he hopes to sell credits for financing operations. Although bitcoin runs counter to those efforts. That stupid thing now uses as much power as Argentina.   \n\n\nTLDR: This is the high wire act right now. Tesla's in this financially comfortable position but has to start showing results. If it stays in this range it's fine. Elon want to prevent withdrawals because once the stock starts falling it could drop precipitously. I'm not saying this would be the end, but it is the end of the unabated upward motion it had been enjoying. $1200 will be a real slog, not like before the split."

If you apply the same logic and the idea that history repeats itself, you would see that Tesla will have a huge piece of the EV pie in the next coming years. As we saw with $GME and $AMC, we saw how some stocks completely depart from fundamentals due to market makers and institutions. However, most institutions that invest in Tesla have continued to support it due to what Tesla has been able to achieve and what it plans to achieve in the future. As long as they keep selling more cars and Elon Musk doesn\u2019t get shot by oil executives, to answer your question, no it\u2019s not the beginning of the end. Especially with the new wave of stimulus checks, more money will inflate the price of stocks these next few weeks. The correction we saw with Tesla is healthy because stocks that have too much bullish momentum tend to crash if they don\u2019t consolidate. Hold and buy the dip!!! (Note: Note financial advice)"

     "Here\u2019s the update on what happened with insider trading which IMO created an over exaggerated selling of shares .. Short lived an once digested imo it will resume on the upward trend . \n\n\nUPDATE: Elon Musk's brother Kimbal just sold some Tesla stock. Is he calling a top?\n\n7:42 am ET February 12, 2021 (MarketWatch)\n Print\nClaudia Assis, and Tomi Kilgore\n\nKimbal Musk sells shares while Vanguard increases stake and another board member makes nearly $119 million on his trades\n\nA few Tesla Inc. insiders have had a busy couple of days this week, including one investor who is close to Chief Executive Elon Musk and again showing some good timing in his trades.\n\nThat's Elon Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, a Tesla (TSLA) board member and entrepreneur, who sold $25.56 million in shares (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musks-brother-kimbal-sells-256-million-of-tesla-stock-2021-02-11) in the open market this week with all the trades made above $850, according to a filing (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000149473121000001/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml).\n\nThe last time Kimbal Musk sold shares of the electric-vehicle maker, he also exercised options to buy the same amount, just at a much lower price. At the time, Kimbal Musk's sales seemed to mark a high for the stock for more than 2 1/2 months.\n\nKimbal Musk's timing was good this week, too. He sold his 30,000 shares on Feb. 9 in a series of trades at a weighted-average price of $852.117, according to a MarketWatch analysis of SEC data. The stock opened that day at $855.12 and traded in an intraday range of $859.80 to $841.75, before closing at $849.46.\n\nOn Wednesday, the stock (TSLA) dropped 5.3%, with an intraday high of just $844.82. It rose 0.9% on Thursday, but, at $811.66, it was still well below where Kimbal Musk sold his shares.\n\nHere are Kimbal Musk's trades:\n\n-- Sold: 7,971 shares at $850.277 (weighted average)\n\n-- Sold: 11,409 shares at $851.452\n\n-- Sold: 1,983 shares at $852.243\n\n-- Sold: 3,482 shares at $853.767\n\n-- Sold 3,415 shares at $854.805\n\n-- Sold: 1,140 shares at $855.927\n\n-- Sold: 600 shares at $856.676\n\nAfter the sales, Kimbal Musk still owned 599,740 Tesla common shares, or about 0.06% of the shares outstanding. His remaining stake is worth about $486.8 million shares at Thursday's close.\n\nTesla's stock has run up 97.1% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 index has gained 10.7%.\n\nVanguard increases stake to be the second largest shareholder\n\nWhile Kimbal sold, the Vanguard Group disclosed that it owned 57.81 million shares (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/102909/000110465921019218/tv01960-teslainc.htm), or 6.1% of the outstanding shares, according to an SEC filing Wednesday.\n\nThat makes Vanguard the second largest shareholder, behind Elon Musk at about 18% and ahead of Capital Research & Management Co. at 5.5%, according to FactSet.\n\nThat means Vanguard recently bought about 14.53 million Tesla shares, as the fund manager had previously disclosed that it owned 43.28 million shares, or 4.4% of the shares outstanding, as of Sept. 30. Prices paid for the shares were not disclosed.\n\nBoard member Antonio Gracias makes a pretty penny trading Tesla shares\n\nn another SEC filing late Wednesday (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000149515821000001/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml), Tesla disclosed that private-equity investor Antonio Gracias, a longtime Tesla board member and close to Elon Musk, acquired earlier this week a total of 150,747 shares at a weighted average price of $58.149 through the exercising of derivative securities.\n\nOn Feb. 9, the same day Kimbal Musk sold his stock, the filing shows Gracias sold 150,747 shares in a series of trades. He didn't do as well as Kimbal Musk, however, as he sold his shares at a weighted average price of $846.591.\n\nStill, Gracias made $118.86 million on the trades.\n\nHere are the Gracias's trades:\n\n-- Acquired: 97,000 shares at $52.38\n\n-- Acquired: 53,747 shares at $68.56\n\n-- Sold: 1,930 shares at $842.596 (weighted average)\n\n-- Sold: 13,256 shares at $843.51\n\n-- Sold: 22,036 shares at $844.372\n\n-- Sold: 22,122 shares at $845.364\n\n-- Sold: 19,320 shares at $846.381\n\n-- Sold: 19,039 shares at $847.36\n\n-- Sold: 34,023 shares at $848.404\n\n-- Sold: 18,588 shares at $849.32\n\n-- Sold: 433 shares at $850.346\n\nAfter the trade, Gracias owned 2,545 common Tesla shares.\n\nSteve Goldstein contributed to this report.\n\n-Claudia Assis; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com\n\n\t\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nFebruary 12, 2021 07:42 ET (12:42 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."

Even if you account for every possible bull case you could ever contrive for this company, Tesla is still overvalued. It might not happen this month, or even six months from now, but eventually Tesla's value is going to return to fundamentals. Everyone thinks they're bulletproof and a genius in a bubble. But Tesla's p/e ratio is >10x Amazon's. It will crash, and hard, eventually. I'll be ready to buy in when it does, but for now I'm buying cheap otm puts every month and waiting for it to collapse. There's gonna be lots of people who say 'this wont age well' and 'youre just a hater', but take some advice from Buffett and Graham - fundamentals ALWAYS matter. In the end, it's always about that. And Tesla simply doesn't have fundamentals to support the value it's at. FMV IMO is $80-100 or maybe, maybe up to $150 if you're super bullish and assume every possible thing goes right for them and somehow robotaxis are the future. But to answer the question yes/no. Nobody can time it, but this bubble will pop."

The premium on 3/17/2023 $1,000 calls are around $200. If I sold 11 covered calls, I could collect around $200,000 and it would be tax free. Id also be very happy to sell all my shares at $1,000 whether its this year or in 2023. Is there any reason why I shouldnt do this? Worst case scenario is Im left with $200,000 and a bag of worthless Tesla right? I admit this idea has come up in light of rising rates. I figured I might as make some money if tech continues to dive. Yes, I realize this would have been better applied a month ago lol'",

     "You gotta ask yourself a simple question. \n\nIf you did NOT own 1154 shares of Tesla, would you be enticed to sell a naked put on it?\n\nIf the answer is NO, then don't do it, as it is the same exact position.\n\nYou are better advised to establish a collar around Tesla, selling a call and buying an OTM put.  The put can be cheaper and further out. Since you are in it for the long haul, NO MATTER where Tesla goes over the next couple of years, just keep reestablishing the collar every month/week. With effective execution and paying some attention to certain adjustments,  you can reduce your basis on Tesla to a very low dollar amount if not nothing. This way your downside and upside are both limited, but since you immediately reestablish it, and since you are receiving a credit each time (makes sense to lose more on the downside as you were initially bullish on the stock, but that does not really matter if you are sharp enough), you are effectively reducing your cost basis on Tesla.\n\nSo basically I am just asking you to write the same call, but add a further otm put. If the call gets past it's strike, close the position and re-establish the collar. Same for the downside. But instead of a leap, we are working with weekly's and monthly's.\n\nIf you are ready to put some work in, and read up a little, you might as well net a whole million of this over the next two or three years, instead of netting 200 k and undertaking the FULL downside risk. It's worth a shot and you are getting paid five fold for your efforts with a reduction in total risk. \n\nHedge funds dont use collars, because the hedge fund industry is ultra competitive, and if the past ten years of below par gains are any indication, fund managers have and always will, look for homeruns to catch the attention. A limited downside and a limited upside is too boring for them.\n\n(That last para is more tongue-in-cheek then anything else, something I read, can't vouch for it)."

TSLA could be worth $2000/share by then.  You just don\u2019t know.  Better to sell quarterly call options which after doing it 8 times over 2 years will yield you more than 200,000 AND give you more control over your shares.\n\nDefinitely what I would do"

Mostly super short microtrends watching the 1/5 minutes, while keeping an eye on longer trends, but not as closely. Anywho on GME this week I made over 5000 buying ITM or close to the money options playing both sides, cutting losers quick and not pushing my luck on winners. TSLA is the only company I could imagine having violent/wide enough swings in a day to compare. So I'm curious if anyone does this consistently or if this is their goto. Not looking to replicate my gains this week normally, just curious on consensus. I made a quick couple hundred on 1 call and 1 put for TSLA today, but I just wonder if that's mostly due to the recent run-up and its especially volatile right now.\\n\\nTLDR: anyone do multiple 5-15 minute day trades a day as a main strategy, if so what tickers\"",

     "**Intraday: when to switch from 0DTE to 1DTE?**\n\nHi everyone!\n\nI have been day trading 0dte options on $SPX and trying to understand when would be the ideal moment of the session to switch from 0dte to 1dte.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I believe that from a certain moment theta starts playing a very significant role in price decay (from my analysis, around 1h30-2h00 before the end of the session). From around that moment, theta becomes a swirl, sucking up essentially all the extrinsic value (assuming IV remains constant).\n\nHowever, before that happens, I have the intuition that there is a moment when theta becomes already \"too significant\" in relation to gamma (which in theory is increasing, albeit at a different pace from abs(theta)). For my trading style, high gamma is desirable.\n\nI tried computing an intraday gamma/theta ratio, giving me a curve which tends to decrease until the end of the session (sometimes with interesting \"hiccups\") and I was thinking on using a certain level of that curve as a threshold under which I'd switch to 1dte, i.e. to a tenor with less gamma but also (more so) less theta...\n\nI imagine that the choice of that threshold also depends on the average duration of my trades, right?\n\nHas anyone considered this problem? Reached interesting conclusions?"

My question is regarding pattern day trading. If I buy say, 5 put credit spreads of the same strikes, and were to sell them the same day, which I\u2019m really planning on doing every other day, but just for reference, would buying and selling 5 put credit spreads in the same day only count as 1 day trade? 5 day trades?

Instead, I made a careless mistake and actually set a limit order for **4** **contracts of 24 Apr RUT 1825/1830 CCS @.30**.\n\nOrder was filled a few minutes later. I didn't even realize it at first until I looked at my position tab and saw this:\n\n**-5 1820 C**\n\n**+1 1825 C**\n\n**+4 1830 C**\n\nSo, due to my careless mistake, I effectively BTO and STC the 1825 strike. I'm confused about how this will work out on Monday. Do I still technically have both the 1820/1825 and 1825/1830 spreads? If RUT stays below 1820, does everything just expire worthless and I collect max credit like I normally would? I never hold spreads to expiration, so maybe the more important question is how I would potentially get out of these positions if I'm in profit?"

They collect the premium on the options and make it appear that the price is going in a certain direction. Once they see where the majority of the itm options are bought they keep the price away from those strikes. They know they dont have to buy any shares because they're controlling where the stock price ends up . Now, they don't have to buy to cover because they're controlling all aspects of the price. They slowly chip away at retailers money and they will end up with everyone's stimulus in part to  the premium they collect. It's a big club and we ain't in it. You can't tell me that gme basically dropping by half all of a sudden after the halt and then amc trading back and forth by pennies ALL damn day ($13.98 - $14.02)isn't suspicious especially with the volume we've been seeing \ud83e\udd14  There's a lot of backroom, dark pool trading stuff going on and unless Cohen can get the board to recall the shares for votes it will continue as they chip away at our portfolios a dollar at a time. They have the capital and the time to do it and they've been sticking in our asses for decades and no one is stopping them. The media, the dtcc, congress,  etc., are all in the same damn bed giving eachother handies and wiping their noses and asses with our money and futures.\n\nEdit: we may as well just drive out to wall street and throw our wallets out the window. Im holding off buying any options until after the gme conference call to see where that goes.\nEdit 2: the only reason anything was done in 2008 was because everyone lost everything and main street forced Congress's hand. Then they overturned all the regulations a few years ago when it was no longer fresh in our minds.  We need to make more noise and force their hands again.

I've had good experiences with customer service, I'm used to the app and how Power Etrade works, and my company stocks vest there, so I have a view of all of my stocks at once.  My only issue is that they do not seem to offer any money market type interest for cash sitting in the account.  I opened up a fidelity account to take advantage of that, but I just didn't like the UI and app as much.  I hate to just give up on earning 3-4% on my cash throughout the year by leaving my money in Etrade, but is there any other site with a modern UI like that that does offer a decent money market fund?"

     "Without knowing how much of your PF is in these shares, or what  the rest of your PF is consisting of all I can do is give some suggestions. The tricky part with all of this is sizing.\n\n1.) Look at the stock's beta to a sector etf or competitor. If you want  to hedge the sector, you can take a small short position in this, using your long shares as collateral. I wouldnt do this in serious size, maybe 10% at most.\n Eg.long 100k in AAPL, short 10k QQQ\n\n2.) You can put on \"costless\" collars, sell a call and use it to finance a put. Take a look at the options chain to see if it's  agreeable  to this. \n\n3.) A ratio spread is a good way to get almost free (not riskless) hedges. Sell the 30 delta put, and use that premium to buy 3x 10 delta puts. This is a hedge against extreme moves to the downside. The risk is that the underlying breaches your short put and doesnt reach your long puts upon expiry. The \"cost\" is margin space between the two strikes.\n\n(With hedges like these collars and ratios, I typically buy them 3 months out and roll/manage them monthly. Sometimes I'll leave the existing one on at the end of the month and just put another one on as well. Situuation dictates)\n\n4.)Synthetic Short-  Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put. Those are both short 50 deltas so you just sold 100 shares essentially.  Size according to taste.\n\n5.) If youre straight up buying long dated OTM puts, the trick with that is noticing a time when the IV is abnormally low so you can buy them at a discount. Use IV *Rank* to tell you this. \n\n\nIm not sure how tax loss harvesting works in your jurisdiction so take this with a grain of salt; any losses you incur on these hedges (or elsewhere on your PF) can offset your cap gains. So if youre down 5k, you can sell for 5k profit and net it all out."

When I first started options trading a friend recommended the Options Advisor, by Schaefer. I re-read the section on conservative options strategies, and he goes over his approach to selling options. He favors high quality slow movers with decent volatility, and even sticking to index etfs to minimize exposure to stock events. Basically a strategy of hitting a lot of singles consistently, with tight risk control. He has a nice section on selling credit spreads, as well as selling naked options.\n\nI consider TSLA extremely volatile, momentum driven, sentiment driven, and generally unpredictable.

A contract can be exercised whether it\u2019s ITM, ATM, or OTM.\n\nNow, if SPY is trading at 435, and I buy a 440 call, why would I want to exercise (buy 100 shares) of SPY when I could get them 5 dollars cheaper? \n\nWhat if I bought a 430 call, that\u2019s great! I can buy 100 shares of SPY for 5 dollars less the actual value. \n\nHere\u2019s where value ($) of an option gets either cheaper or more expensive.

Then hertz happened and It flew past $970. I was hoping it would settle down but seeing it $1130 AH I have very little hope it will get back under $970 by Friday. My strategy is let the shares execute on 11/5 for $970 regardless of stock market value. And then I can just sell a put a month out for about 3k and keep repeating that until I get my shares back. That way Im collecting credit until I get my shares back. Thoughts? I think letting them go and selling a put is the best option because it would cost 14k to buy the call option back as of now. It just feels dirty because Im a long term holder of Tesla. I only sold CC to collect rent on my position and would pay back or roll if things went south but this run up blindsided me.\\n\\nUPDATE: Im going to roll over via a 2 option order (sell another call and use credit to buy back this '",

     "In addition to the risk where the stock may unexpectedly breach your strike price, there is also a risk where your broker may force close your OTM positions even before they become ITM. They may do it as long as they think they are near being breached!\n\nI got burned by this today. I had a few put spreads with short strikes at 600, 575, 560, and 530. Near the market closed, there was a sudden dip. While I was trying to add more put for next week, I suddenly received notifications that my OTM positions were closed. While I was still scratching my head about what just happened, I saw the stock made a U turn and then my 780/830 call got closed too! All of these cost me over $2000!\n\nLater I contacted my broker (Tastyworks), they said there was no margin call on my account. It is just some expiration risk management they did. He said if the trend continued and the short leg went into money and the stock dropped on Monday, then my account would suffer a huge loss. That's why they force closed them for me.\n\nI can see where they're coming from and it's my fault not to realize this risk before. But the 530 put and 780 call were so far away from the money. I think they're a bit too aggressive on this. As a comparison, I had a 575 put at TDA and they didn't touch it.\n\nGoing forward, I'll try to close the positions out early even though it cost some money to do so. I hope my story is helpful for people who are not aware of this."

     "Question for all you options enthusiasts that are too intelligent to use WSB as your main forum of discussion (unlike myself who is clearly the type of moron that belongs on there...)\n\nSo, as the dumb speculator and gambler that I am,  I put half of my savings (80k) in Tesla leaps (puts) at a strike of $660 and expiration of 1/2022 about 30 minutes before close. I was planning on holding this for many months but I admit I was hoping I had caught the something close to the top. That last minute spike literally threw my leap underwater by over 10%, which being the novice stock market gambler that I am, I have no precedent to understand whether it was likely a true gap up or more likely to get sold and be volatile next week? Did IV crush or that last minute price movement really decrease the \u201cintrinsic value\u201d of my leaps that quickly? I saw the asks closed at 5 for $195 and bids of 5 for $125 \n\nMy main questions are:\n\na. Are options as \u201crationally priced\u201d during a close for Tesla options as happened at market close today as you would expect on any other day?  \n\nb. Is that immediate selloff in after hours from 695 to 680 as \u201csignificant of an indicator of demand\u201d as the original buying up from 636 to 695 was an indicator? For Monday to be bearish, who would be the supposed sellers on Monday that didnt try to sell at close today to the impending wave of institutional buyers?  Or as a bearish option holder should i see this crazy gap up at market close as scary and a likely indicator of few sellers come Monday?"

     "This may a case of market manipulation (legal or not).  I had money riding on the 660C, sold short, expiring at 4 pm.  I had my buy-to-close market order set up and had my finger on the mouse to pull the trigger.  TSLA was hovering around 660 right before closing, and it showed 658.34 as you said.  The going Call option premium dropped down to 1.00/1.50 from 10 a couple of minutes prior.  So it looked it was going down to 0, expiring worthless, jiving with the wildly fluctuating stock price.  The market closed and 658.34 stuck on the screen for some time.  I went back to the computer 30 mins later and TSLA changed to $695. I called Fidelity and the stock rep pointed out on their Active Trader Pro platform in the \u201cTime and Sale\u201d menu to show the TSLA buy/sale history.  At 16:00:00, the buy/sale history showed the last ones at last price:  Sale 695, Bid 665.15, and Ask 665.96.  How could the stock be sold at 695 while the Bid/Ask were 34 lower?  The Fidelity rep then found a super large size transaction with 69,323,258 shares down the list sold at $695, with Bid/Ask again at $664.99/$665.00.  Who would want to pay $695 when the going price was $34 lower?  Is this market manipulation or what?  Where is the SEC here?"

     "Without any judgments I\u2019m assuming you bought these 12/22 several moments before close. Problem with this strangle is that traditionally Tesla is not an up and down stock during the intraday . It generally comes out of the box either up or down , and stays that way for the day . Your trade leaves you with rapid tim decay and not much room to move . You have 40 dollars on the wingspan, that is actually not a bad spread for Tesla if you had more time . Look at the charts , starting with 11/30 when it was 1131 through Dec 6th at 971 down to 897 on Dec 20 th . You have a downward head with shoulders , into a consolidation at 894 on Dec20 th where it forms a cup with a handle a classic entrance point for a steep increase - in that scenario you put was dooms to fail as the price continued upward . Your move was to recognize that and immediately sell the 990 put for small  loss maybe a small gain . However when it climbed to 1067 today in the PM you should have netted a substantial profit of almost 40 per shares that\u2019s 4000 . Why are you pining ?"

I was studying some past record and found:\n\nStock Example A, back in Nov 2022 stock price was around $60, back then if I pick the Long Call March 30 2023 strike @ $85, it was selling for $3; today the stock is trading @ $87.25 and the Long Call is $5.42 - it doesn't look much profit, but this stock sky rocket to $115 back in mid Jan, and back then the Long Call was pricing @ $30, I think the idea is when your option is deep ITM thats where the big profit comes in?\n\nIf that's the idea, let's say I am hoping a stock will rise 50% by next year, and I should do the LEAPS at around 25%, so if the stock does hit my target and rise 50%, the option is 25% deep ITM, and best to happen couple months before the option expires to have more time value in it?Thanks"

So, I just took this trade:\n\nBought 500 shares of BBBY for 1.15 for a total of $575\n\nSold covered calls, 5 contracts 1/19/2024 C @ 2.00 for 0.57 per share, netting me $285. My total invested so far is $290\n\nBought puts, 5 contracts 1/19/2024 @ 1.00 for 0.59 a share, costing me $ 295. My total invested is $585.\n\nFirst of all, the reason I do this is mostly to learn, and $585 down the drain won't make me richer or poorer.\n\nI believe this is a collar strategy right? My first. I also believe, what makes it a good collar is the assymetry, I have a lot of upside (from 1.15 to 2.00) and exposed to small downside (from 1.15 to 1.00). Is this correct?\n\nThese are the scenarios I see come 1/19/2024:\n\nBBBY ends over $2.00: my put is worthless, my underlying is gone, my call is exercised. I've still made $1000 though, almost double my investment.\n\nBBBY ends between $1.15 and $2.00: my put is worthless, my call is too. I keep my underlying and have made some kind of return, between $0 and $0.85 per share.\n\nBBBY ends between $1.15 and $1.00: my put is worthless, my call is too. I keep my underlying and have lost some money, between $0 and $0.15 per share.\n\nBBBY ends below $1.00: my call is worthless, I keep my underlying, my put appreciated and offset the losses on my underlying, so my loss is capped at $0.15 per share.\n\nAre these scenarios all correct? Do I have something wrong?\n\nLast scenario: BBBY goes bankrupt, or gets delisted, are my options gone? Is my underlying worthless? What about if it gets bought out or taken over? \n\nAll help is appreciated!"

     "If you are going long and then use the STRADDLE or STRANGLE OPTIONS. Both STRADDLE and STRANGLE Option are Bidirectional Strategies that allows one to benefit no matter the direction of the of the stock. Only difference is a STRADDLE OPTIONS is done ATM while the STRANGLE OPTION is OTM. You just need to make sure that the probability is up, meaning the chance of profit is high and above 70%, and make sure that both Deltas are at .50 (CALLS) & -.50 (PUTS), make sure GAMMA has enough speed to outpace \"THETA\" (TIME DECAY). You also want to look at VEGA which is VOLATILITY, this the most important factor of them all because this is the only way any Option can make money. Without Volatility your options will go down in value because of an \"INCREASING THETA\" which THETA is always a negative number. In fact in the case of THETA you want to find one that is low so you loose less money by the day for every day the strategy is open.\n\nThe other reason to go with a STRADDLE or STRANGLE OPTION is because it will help you deal with sudden drops in value in cases like increasing interest rates like the 10 Year Bond Yield or increasing interest rates which have a devastating effect on Tech Stocks. In the case of Tesla, which has a swing between 50 or 60 points and some times more, you can make a ton of money off a strategy like this."

     "LEAPs are one strategy, but you should also consider using calendar LEAPs.\nFor example, your analysis shows stock price of $1000 by 2022. You buy the jan 2022 or 2023 $1000 call, sell the $1000 june 2022 call. If The june call expires worthless, you keep the credit, effectively giving u a lower entry price on your long calls.\n\nThe nice thing about this setup is if price goes down a little in the short term, you can make money on the decline rather than lose. I recommend using options calculator and playing around with different strikes and expiry.\n\nYou can sell the monthly contract vs your LEAP, and just roll the monthly forward for additional credits to lower your cost basis.\n\nAdvanced tip: sell your call at $1200 instead of $1000, which builds in a vertical spread to the calendar. This way if price rises too quickly in the short term, you still make money. You can also use a back ratio to get the same effect. For example, buy 5 $1000 LEAPs and sell 4 $1000 monthlies. Final advanced tip, buy a butterfly to neutralize vega."

I'm making a bearish call spread. This after I covered my short for a profit.  If you think the stock can bounce from here, determine how far and how long it can bounce and make a play at it.

     "The thing with TSLA is that options, whether short term or longer term, are so expensive that it\u2019s often just better in many cases to buy shares and sit on them. One may pay the price of 50 shares for at the money LEAPS on it which expire in two years, so imo in that case I would rather just buy 50 shares for the same price instead of paying that options price to potentially get profits equivalent to 100 shares (if all goes well in those two years without any major hiccups). And shares don\u2019t expire.\n\nBut if you were very bullish on TSLA over the next year or two where you felt it will be at least at and ideally well above your breakeven price for any given LEAPS, then of course you could consider them regardless (keeping in mind all the risks associated with options obviously, with worst case scenario being all of that money disappearing).\n\nThere is of course money to be made with TSLA options, there\u2019s a reason there\u2019s so much craze over them all the time, but one has to have a good amount of funds to risk for a potential 100% loss, and also be right on a lot of things such as how much the stock moves and if that move happens within ones speculated time-frame, etc."

Personally I would write covered calls with the expectations that he is doing the deal,  the 52.50's 3 months out, and own 45's puts 3 month out. net debit is about 1.60 ( 160 cost for the option side ) \n\nif he closes the deal that's a small upside loss of $160 of the cost to put it on and no extra gain from 52.50 onwards \n\nit it fails the max loss is about $360.00 due to the put protection."

The average implied volatility of TSLA is about double that of AAPL so it's expected that TSLA premiums would be much higher on a relative basis.\n\nAs for not finding any other such stocks, you didn't look very far.

     "It\u2019s not that there isn\u2019t anything \u201cwrong\u201d with this...your max profit is 100% in 2 years.  That beats just about anything out there.\n\nThe problem with this is the bulls think so highly of this company that they are believing it will be at 2000 or 2500 over the next several years.  Seems kind of ridiculous but many people are positing that.  So you potentially are missing out on tremendous upside.\n\nI think the better thing to do is write quarterly call options and you can make adjustments every quarter with your strikes.  Remember you only brought in 20K in premium.  I would think you can easily bring in 3-4K/ each quarter with little risk (e.g. delta) and give yourself more wiggle room to increase your strikes over time....so in the event TSLA did moon you can take advantage of that.  \n\n2 years is a very long time to wait for a call option to expire. \n\nAgain...there is nothing wrong with this strategy.  Options are wonderful there are so many things you can do with them"

     "If you have no real intent of keeping the shares ($1k for TSLA in 2 years is not unreasonable based on how the market has behaved), then why not reduce locked up capital by running a pmcc instead of a traditional cc? You do have more downside risk with pmcc since your long could end up worthless (I buy the LEAP at .8 delta for some safety), but your RoC is much higher dollar for dollar.\n\nGenuinely curious."

Especially if your goal is to reduce risk in this trade.\n\nYou could turn this into a collar as well if you want to cap the downside.\n\nIf you moved it to the Jan '22 date, moved to the 900c, and bought a 600p, your max upside is 22.7k and your downside is now 7.2k instead of 50k.  This is significantly less risk for marginally less upside and a shorter duration for this trade. If the trade goes to plan and by EOY, Tesla is at or over $900/share, your net gain is 32.5% on your original 70k. If you had just held shares, your risk would be much more significant and at a $900 price tag, you'd be at a 28.5% gain. This puts you ahead AND caps your downside. A better winner by your risk-off metric, I think.\n\nHere you go for the visual people (make it dark mode, I promise it's worth it):   [https://optionstrat.com/a2EKwjgPAc](https://optionstrat.com/a2EKwjgPAc)\n\nIf you're wrong and by EOY, Tesla is below $600, you can still cash out at a higher market price.\n\nIf Tesla is flat and we see it's still $700 by EOY, then you still took in $2k from the premium on the CC less the premium on the put and your downside was hedged.\n\nJust a thought.\n\nEDIT: Fixed the link"

People will suggest other things that could make more money which is totally valid, but I've been in finance long enough to know that nobody knows what can happen; we only know what has happened.

The stock could correct and your covered call premiums could be reduced yielding less than $20,000 over the same period. \n\nIf you're happy with the potential to take a double in two years, which by the way exceeds the index 5x, that's huge! You're more in control of your returns. There are people that will criticize the investment but they might not even make $20,000 in two years on $50,000. At the end of the day, you need to be happy and content with your trade/investment. And if you are, don't let anyone change it. The only time you should consider a second opinion is if you can recreate the trade with less risk or a more efficient method that guarantees a return in excess of your 40%.\n\nEdit: Had to correct the return and changed wording."

     "The other thing I've considered is, these might be completely gamma plays.\n\n\nWith all of the unusual scanners and people just following along, consider if that option moved just $.01 because of other people following along. That's a 33% ROI from a 1 cent move, which could be obtained from volatility and increased interest alone. But the other thing that I think about would be.. how would you exit on 40,000 contracts. Surely there's not THAT many people just \"following along\".\n\n\nI get that whoever made that writeup is certainly smarter than I am. But I also have a hard time wrapping my head around why you ever throw away $120,000 as a hedge clear down at the $40 put. Have we ever seen any company tank 90% in 9 days that actually produces a tangible product? I'm not so sure, but if you still think about what would happen to those contracts if it tanked even 15-20% in those 9 days, you would have huge returns on your investment (provided you could actually find another bag holder)."

     ">Recall from our previous commentary that a dealer is short massive call spreads in TSLA OTC to a major Japanese tech fund. The dealer is most definitely long stock on a delta neutral basis to hedge their short call spread. This much long stock will probably cause the dealer to blow through the firm's risk limits in the event the stock goes to zero. The dealer's risk management department probably forced them to buy these puts as a hedge.\n\n>If the above premise is true, one can back out the notional of the OTC call spreads that the dealer is short. These call spreads are probably 15 to 25 delta spreads. Now long 40,000 puts corresponds to hedging 4MM shares. Using a 20 delta, one can infer that the Japanese tech fund is probably long call spreads on around 20MM shares of TSLA (~$8 billion of notional).\n\n>This ties in with the $50 billion notional of call spreads purchased by the Japanese fund across around five tech names as has been reported in the press.\n\n\nELIR what half that means? I'm sure its as simple as hedging overall risk, but trying to understand the math behind the above language."

     "Hi all!  \nI am developing a tool to explore the options chain for all US stocks. At the moment this is biased towards selling cash-secured puts. Basically each day I download the data and process it with some filters and extra calculations. For example, I compute the (annualized) return on capital as bid/strike, link the option to the underlying's probability of hitting the strike (this is a probability similar to delta) and so on...  \nI am curious what do you think of this approach? What other analytics could be useful? Is this a tool someone will be willing to pay for (10-20 USD/month) if it is polished and released as a product? (At the moment I use it on my own only.)  \nMy idea was that an application like this could zoom one's attention towards particular options to sell, after further research. Does this make sense or since it uses daily data it is already too late and there is no edge in finding possible opportunities? Or perhaps it gives suggestions, but there is no edge because it lacks certain context and price/greeks data are not enough?  \nDo you have any suggestions in what other venue I could ask for feedback on this?  \n\n\nScreenshots: \n\n[https://ibb.co/sPCnThZ](https://ibb.co/sPCnThZ)\n\n[https://ibb.co/bmSgN1t](https://ibb.co/bmSgN1t)\n\n  \nMany thanks!"

(if i was looking to make a trade at that moment in time)\n\nI will use the open today as an example (3/14/2023) and TSLA.\n\nTSLA opened today at 177.31 and is currently sitting about 180.03 when writing this post.\n\nPulled up the chain, and looked randomly really, at APR 21, 2023 185 premium is at 12.85 currently just for this example.\n\nHas the stock move up from 177.31 to 180.03 been fully realized in that premium or should I wait some time for it to fully adjust? Is there an easy way for options traders to be confident that we are seeing a fully adjusted premium bid and ask price when we want to sell or buy an option?\n\nThis is very general. I know there are a ton of things changing all the time. The stock price is always changing and some stocks are more volatile than others etc etc..

However, what I\u2019ve been doing when this happens is roll the call forward to a higher price for no change in credit. As far as I can tell, I could do this indefinitely and while it may take me longer to recognize the profits from the covered call, I would still be making more than just holding the shares by themselves. I know there is no free lunch, so what am I missing here? Is it just the fact that it limits your liquidity unless you want to risk closing the position early for a loss?"

I decided to finally sell a covered call for practicing purposes, 22 strike 3/17/23 sold to open at .575\n\nAt some point the stock today hit 21.34 cost/share and the price of the premium was .50, the P&L column showed +7.34. Then at another point price was 21.52 cost/share and P&L showed -0.16.     \n\nAnd this is the confusing part for me...on most tutorials I've watched/read, they talk about collecting the premium, and if the price of the stock hits the strike price, then you lose your shares. However, from what I saw on my trade today, as the price went higher, the P&L was negative.

Which is pretty easy when we have seen speculative stocks crash the last few months. \n\nI had options that lost a lot of value around the same time. \n\nCan Tesla return to $800 8 months?  It can. \n\nI think you should evaluate your holding based on opportunity cost. You might not want to hold it if you feel better about a different holding. I would try and look at the situation like you had bought it yesterday. And, just not care what it cost. Because that is over now. Your next play however has not happened"

Minimum Div of 2% yield, and at least $2.00 annual payout, quarterly\n4. IV between 25 - 75\n5. Price between $x to $y based on your account size and risk tolerance\n6. Then, trending above its 200 EMA, and good bid/ask pricing. Check the bid/ask prices in the front week and 42DTE week to see strike selection and tight pricing\n7. Liquidity is my most important criteria, thus the need for weeklies. The div also culls out the \"growth\" stocks that have not made money.

Per Burry's filing ( https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921010281/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml ), he controls 800,100 shares (through 8001 puts), which control a notional value of Tesla of $534 million.  Notional value is based on the price of Tesla at the end of the quarter. Whether your contract is ATM or deep OTM, the notional would be the same. \n\nAm I missing something, or is the news about Burry's short blatantly wrong?"

     "Some of his PR moves lately have been controversial, however, they may just be Elon Musk moving chess pieces around the board.  For example, he bought bitcoin, then later said bitcoin mining might be bad for the environment.  Sure, this may be due to potential pressure from energy credits gained from selling electric cars, or, it may be a way for him to incentivize people to invest in green energy when he moves into crypto mining.  Or, it could be to increase the attractiveness of dogecoin, which he seems heavily invested to, and since he owns bitcoin, he limits the amount of bitcoin backlash for being pro other cryptocurrencies.  He also did make a profit on bitcoin.  Furthermore, Tesla has horizontal expansion, meaning, they benefit from having other types of businesses.  So, it is hard to think this is really a sink or swim moment for me, since the other option is that this is not an immature CEO being whimsical, but rather, a skilled tactician, setting up futures plays.\n\nWent all in with 90% of portfolio X2 leverage in premarket this morning at 569.63  I'm a microfish so that amounts to $17088.81.  Since I am a day/swing trader, I may not continue holding if I see other opportunities, but definitely monitor Tesla continually."

     "For future reference, don't cap all your stock with CCs. Always leave some minimum amount of delta and just manage your theta + delta. I use spreads + stock instead as smaller account, but concept is the same.\n\nIE: If you have say 1000 shares of stock, and you sell covered calls on all 1000 shares, you have effectively a delta of somewhere between 0 and 1000 shares (positional delta), and if you used say 0.2 delta calls, that is going to be around 800 positional delta to start, but as you go up, that relatively quickly shifts from 800 to 0 positional delta.\n\nIf you instead sold say 7 calls at least 0.7 delta. You would start with 300+490=790 positional delta and always have at least 300 delta, and have no more than 1000 positional delta. The downside is that you have have less theta and a lower initial positional delta. You can likely solve both by selling some short puts below your current price. This would increase your max positional delta (above 1000), while also increasing your theta. Though in this case if the stock goes up enough you'll want to close your short put early as a profit, if it goes down enough you'll want to close your short call for a profit. Of course, if it goes up too much, you'll take some loss (but the gains from your stock + short put will off set it), while if the stock goes down you'll lose some money, but your calls will take money. One just needs to be careful with  how much they can move. (the ideal solution here might be to sell 100 or so shares of stock and replace that with short put(s) (or short put spreads) with similar or slightly greater delta. Keeping at least half the positional delta of the position in stock.\n\nThis effectively allows you to swing trade as well. If timed well enough (or if there isn't too much movement), you can take profit on both sides.\n\nEdit: Corrected to use 790 as the total rather than 700. This brings it much more in line with what it would have been. Of course, a 0.7 delta is a bit more likely to be ITM than a 0.8 delta. If we used a 0.8 instead, it would be 860. Another downside with this approach is that it does require a fair bit more management than the standard wheel."

I get that.  \nBut why do people in general say selling naked options are dangerous?

There's a lot of money to be made this week, especially with [*collateral plays*](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays), so make sure you've brushed up on those concepts if you haven't already! Let's get into it.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n---\\n\\n#The Spreadsheet\\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORRe\"",

The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.\\n\\n**This Week  Earnings heat up as IV cools**\\n\\nSPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. Thats as low a move as weve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report.

Its copier technology was earth shattering at the time (hard to believe now). It had a stable of amazing inventions being developed at Xerox PARC.

     "What am I misunderstanding?  I am bearish on SNDL.  SNDL is $1.57.  I wanted to buy a Jan 25 Put for $1.50.  This forum says that ITM and ATM options are better values.\n\nOk, so I load it here:\n\n[https://imgur.com/kwCJrS0](https://imgur.com/kwCJrS0)\n\nThis tells me that price has to get to $1.02, a .55 drop, TOMORROW for me to break even???  So if I want to make money being bearish on SNDL, price has to decline nearly 36%????\n\n**How can I make money being bearish on SNDL without price needing to go 36% in my favor TOMORROW in order to break even, because if it takes longer to do so then I won't make money or it will have to go further in my direction to make profit?  For example, if price is at $0.75 on the day of expiration, I will break even.  PRICE WENT OVER 50% IN MY FAVOR AND I MADE NO MONEY IN THIS SCENARIO.**\n\nI know, this forum says \"NEVER KEEP OPTIONS TIL EXPIRATION.\"  Of course not.  But this put looks like it won't even make any money unless price goes beyond 36% (tomorrow) or 54% (later) in my favor.  Why would I be able to know if price is going to move that far?\n\nI am pretty sure SNDL will be around $1.00 at some point.  I am not sure it will happen TOMORROW.  But even if I buy this put and price gets to $1.10, I will still lose money.\n\nI do not want to short SNDL.  I do not want to take risk by selling calls.  I want to make money from downward movement of the stock but apparently it needs to go really far for me to do so.  What am I missing and how do I make money on a downward move in SNDL that doesn't need to go massive distances to make money?"

Hypothetically, isn\u2019t selling ABC short by 1000 shares equivalent to selling 10 call options? So I could do 10 long calls at $50 strike and short sell 1000 shares? I suppose the big difference here is I don\u2019t get to choose a strike price per say short selling. I would just have to close my positions all at once if my long calls are profitable.\n\nI\u2019m not totally sure how the math works out.

Like, imagine a stock is $4 and you have a $6 strike put which is trading at $0.10/2.00 or something ridiculous.  You paid $.50 for it, so selling it would be a loss.  But it's got $2 of intrinsic value.  Do you just let have the shares get called away (sell 100 at $6) and then immediately buy to cover at $4?  Is it smarter to buy the shares right before close the day on expiration in case there's a gap overnight before you sell the assigned shares?  Like it might bite if you had your $6 put expire because you couldn't sell it, and then you sold the shares at $6, and then Monday morning price opened at $100 or something.  But if you bought the shares before close at $4, then who cares if it opens at $100, because you'd still make your $2 profit when you were assigned sale of the shares at $6, yes?"

I have a plethora of investments varying in risk from risk averse long term investments to high risk items\u2026in other words, day trades on the strategy I\u2019m employing with options will not blow my entire investment portfolio.\r  \nI have formulated trading strategy that I can remain consistent on and I trade premiums only for smaller profits but presumably less risk/loss potential.  I suppose that I am looking for a bit of confirmation that I am on a reasonable path forward with my approach and making reasonable assumptions about profit potential.  \r  \n\r  \nStrategy:\r  \n\\-I only trade premiums (to mitigate risk).  Loss potential is only what was spent on the premium. \r  \n\\-Only trade premiums on 3-4 leveraged Index ETFs utilizing SPY as an \u201cindicator\u201d.  I watch these ETFs daily to stay on top of recognizing trends and price movement.  I don\u2019t really keep an eye on anything else besides these funds.\r  \n\\-Each trade I make is 8-10% of account total with stops placed at a 10-15% loss (10% of 10% = 1% of account total). \r  \n\\-The goal on each trade is to sell at 15% profit, if I don\u2019t get the warm and fuzzies that it will hit 15%, I will sell early.  The way I see it is, 3%, 5%, 1.5% is all profit and profit is profit and not loss.  Are there any reasons not to sell in the green just because it\u2019s not in the green enough? \r  \n\\-In general, I try to execute 2-4 trades per week, but only when I\u2019m confident on the direction.  I am perfectly fine with sitting out of trades to wait until I get a good feeling on direction.\r  \n\\-I stick with Deltas >.5 and generally go for expiration dates that are 7-14 days out. \r  \n\\-Track the shit out of everything and mull over the data of what worked, what didn\u2019t work, etc every week\u2019s end. \n\n\r  \nDoes this strategy seem legit?  So far, I\u2019ve had a profitability rate of about 85% and lose rate of 15%.  \r  \nI\u2019ve read with compounding it would be possible to double this account in a relatively short period of time, is there any truth to this?  I am earning around .5% - 1.5% profit on the total of the account per trade.  \r  \nI see where people say they grow their accounts heavily at first and then tank and lose it all.  Why is this?

     "I think some of the previous comments about delta are misinterpreting what you meant. I'm pretty sure you mean that the magnitude of the value of your spread has gone up, meaning it has become more expensive for you to close the spread, and it therefore currently shows a net loss, right?\n\nIf so, the reason for this is probably IV expansion. Changes in option prices are related to movements in the underlying (described by Greeks like delta and gamma), but they're also related to changes in IV (described by vega). OTM credit spreads have overall negative vega, meaning IV decreasing benefits you, while IV increasing hurts you. The reason for this is that increasing IV generally pushes up the price of all options, but it will usually push up the price of options closer to ATM more than the price of options further OTM. Decreasing IV generally pushes down the price of all options, but it will usually push down the price of options closer to ATM more than the price of options further OTM. In a credit spread, the short leg is closer to ATM, so when IV increases, the loss on your short leg will be larger than the gain on your long leg. Similarly, when IV decreases, you benefit since the gain on your short leg will be larger than the loss on your short leg.\n\nTherefore, what likely happened is that TSLA's IV increased from yesterday to today, and this had a greater effect on the spread's price than the effect from the underlying going up."

     "It all depends on what you think TSLA will do over the next week. It could be one of the following scenarios:\n\n1. TSLA stays below $1130. You gain whatever extrinsic value your option has right now. \n2. TSLA goes down to $1049.99 or lower. Your option expires worthless. \n3. TSLA goes above $1130. In this case, you'll miss out on more gains by the stock going up than what you lose by closing out the option. \n\nRolling is the same as taking the loss, and opening another different position. Don't let your current trade dictate where you should open your next trade at.   \nIf you think TSLA will keep going up, close the position. If you still want to open a CC, find a good strike for it, and open it there. Don't stay attached to this one."

     "I think the issue most retail investors are faced with when it comes to TSLA, in particular, is that buying calls even 6 months DTE is extremely cost-intensive atm. TSLA is in a high IV environment with an IVR of 55.5 and an IV% of 89.8 respectively. Typically it is not wise to purchase options on an underlying with high IV%. In this case TSLA is 89.9% higher in IV than in the previous 52 weeks (today). The 445 calls for Sept 25th (battery week) are around 41.10. Come battery week, the IV will probably increase into the 90's, making the buy-side of the options relatively more expensive. As traders, we should be looking to buy options in low IV, and sell premium in high IV. \n\nI think the real battery week play here for the Sept 25th expiration would be a long broken wing butterfly. More than likely the SP will mimic earnings and taper off shortly after. Given this is September and institutions aren't done profit-taking with the election about 8 weeks away.  ATM of me typing this, NQ futures are down 1.18% so tomorrow will probably be optimal for a BWB credit spread play or long puts @ the Oct 2nd or Oct 9th expirations if you have the capital. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Position: Long Put BWB (Net Cr 2.50) (Max Profit 770 if SP pins around 385 Short Puts)\n\n1 370P\n\n\\-2 385P\n\n1 390P"

My prediction is that it will be enough to satisfy current investors into not selling but not enough to create a hype train again. I expect a moderate rise up leading to the day itself (Elon will probably be super leaky this week, so depending on how juicy his tweets are it may hit some high levels) followed by a flatline after the event or a small dip if it's not what's expected. \n\nThe lithium play is a huge risk. If they do end up unveiling solid state batteries then lithium is in for a terrible future. Nickel is the metal of choice if you want to take the cheaper route. Giga Metals in Canada is the current rumoured source.\n\nWith battery day in everyone's sight and stars in their eyes for this new tech it's worth remembering that the stock market doesn't always do the expected thing. With the number of people piled into the battery day play a lot is priced in. Those expecting it to rocket after the event have already bought. And those who still don't have shares are probably not running to grab any because of the polarized nature of Tesla in the market. \n\nTl;dr I'm expecting a run up prior to the event itself.

You need TSLA to double its evaluation (which is already considered somewhat insane by most metrics) in a 26 month time period.\n\nIf you insist on doing it, at least do a PMCC instead to get that cost-basis down. A 2023-01-20 $2000 call could reduce your cost by roughly half and then you get another year to collect more premium. If you really want to invest $14,500 and are open to the spread you could drop the strikes pretty significantly. The below position is still around $14,500 invested but instead of  needing Tesla to get to $2,145 you \"only\" need it to get to $1,745. \n\n* \\+1 2024-01-19: $1600\n* \\-1 2023-01-20: $1900\n\nThe mid is $143.40 so you could probably fill a little lower than $145 but lets just say $145. If you get assigned early because TSLA explodes and you don't get a chance to move the short leg out, you'd make $300-$145 ($15,500).

You effectively just move the maintenance amount out of the loan and into the cost of the put itself. Since the put will gain value as the shares lose value, the maintenance requirement is discounted by the gain in value of the put.\n\nTo answer the literal title question, strike selection is effectively an insurance cost/benefit analysis. How much do you want to spend in insurance premium to protect how much value in the shares? Most people want to get leverage through their insurance premium, so puts are usually OTM to the current spot price of the shares. Which typically have appreciated in value over the initial cost. So the married put is to protect some amount of unrealized gains."

The share price increase did not happen but I was able to sell the deep ITM call to lock a small profit. \n\nI did just this, then at close realized the two week 3/10 $1 calls are actually 5 cents cheaper, for whatever reason, than the current value of the weekly $1s I sold. \n\nCould I essentially leg into a \"credit calendar\" calendar, freeing up my ability to sell the shares tomorrow, then close the credit calendar for next to nothing?"

Here is the sample trade in Robinhood - https://imgur.com/a/pYsEMTJ\nLong Put: This bearish strategy has 1 leg. It gives you the right to sell shares of the underlying asset at the strike price by the expiration date. Typically, the goal isn't to exercise, but to sell the contract for a profit before expiration. Ideally, the underlying's price quickly drops before time decay reduces the contract's value. This strategy will do poorly if the underlying's price rises above the strike price and your option expires worthless. You'll pay a debit to open this position.\nYou're paying $720.00 for the right to Sell 200 shares of QQQ for $200.00 per share by January 19. 2024. If QQQ shares aren't $200.00 or lower on January 19, 2024, these options will expire worthless.\nI would like to ensure options are not executed and should expire, if it comes to that.

     "I'm trying to answer these questions to enable options trading on my account\n\nPlease answer the following questions carefully.\n\nCall and put options are opposite sides of the same transaction? I answered FALSE\n\nEquity option contracts ALWAYS cover 100 shares? I answered FALSE\n\nOn the Australian stock exchange website there is this quote \"On ASX's options market an option contract size is standardised at 100 underlying shares. That means, one option contract represents 100 underlying shares. This may change if there is an adjustment such as a new issue or a reorganisation of capital in the underlying share.\"\n\nThe buyer of a put option has the right to sell the underlying asset? I answered TRUE\n\nA BHP March $45 call option gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy BHP shares at $45 any time on or before the expiry date in March. I answered TRUE\n\nOptions contracts are available over ALL ASX listed companies? I answered FALSE\n\nIf I have bought a call option contract I can take my profit at any time by selling an identical option contract. I answered FALSE\n\n(Surely if you did that you would just have two open positions?)\n\nThe most you can lose when you buy a put option is the underlying shares price? I answered FALSE\n\nIf I sell a NAB option I can close it out by buying back a BHP option? I answered FALSE\n\nOptions are a wasting asset as they have an expiry date and therefore a limited life. Time value erodes over time for an option. I answered TRUE\n\nAn Exchange Traded Options is a standardised contract between a buyer and a seller that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or to sell a particular asset (the underlying asset) on or before the options expiry date, at an agreed price, (the strike price). I answered TRUE\n\nMaybe somebody can tell me where I'm going wrong?"

     "Hello,\n\nI have a question about how to think about trading my stock.\n\nI bought 1000 AMD shares many years ago.\n\nThe cost basis is roughly around $40\n\nIt is in my IRA account, so I can repurchase it without tax implications if the prices stay roughly the same or even if it moves past the strike price by a few dollars. I like to be conservative in my trading and hold these shares until 2025.\n\nRight now, I am doing a covered call spread.\n\nE.g.\n\nAMD is at 79.XX\n\nI would sell weeklies like 10 March 2023 - 85 strike, which is \"0.14\" delta - I get 40 cents for a total of $400.\n\nI will then buy protection at 90 for the same date, which is \"0.04\" delta. I pay 10 cents for it for a total of $100.\n\nMy net, if all goes well, is $300.\n\nMy net, if the stock takes off like crazy, which shouldn't happen every week, is $5 \\* 1000 = 5000 - 300 = -$4700\n\nI can fine-tune this to a lower number, meaning lower earnings. I can have one such take-off event every 15 times I win; otherwise, I lose.\n\nThis strategy allows me upward protection. I do not have downward protection at all.\n\nI was thinking of modifying the strategy a little differently and selling ITM calls like\n\nSell 10th March 2023 75 strike - Delta of \"0.76\" for $4.40 - $4400\n\nBuy 10th March 2023 82 strike - Delta of \"0.28\" for $1.24 - $1240\n\nMy net is 75 + 4.40 - 1.24 = 78.16\n\nMy repurchase if it breaches $82 is 3.84 \\* 1000 = $3840\n\nThis strategy provides some downward protection, and the upward is too close for comfort.\n\nHow do yall deal with this? Is there a good rule of thumb that I should start with? What if the shares were not in an IRA, which has tax implications?\n\nWhatever ideas you all share, I will try them in my paper trade account to get a feel before deploying.  \n\n\nI couldn't post this in the main forum."

     "The way I've been doing covered calls recently is leapfrogging (not an actual strategy word).\n\nYou own 340 shares, so let's say you have 3 tranches, each with 100 shares, that you can sell one option on. \n\nConsider selling one covered call for next week, one for the week after that, and the last one the week after that.\n\nYou will always be selling a call every week, but once the 3rd week goes by, you'll be closing or letting expire a 3-week old option for higher premium and/or higher strike than you'd be able to focusing just on weeklies, and then selling another 3-week expiry option again.\n\nEdit - I'm also doing this on a monthly dividend paying ETF. So, assuming I don't get called away, I'm making ~5% (annually) on the dividend on top of the call premium. If I do get called away, I'm totally fine with that, I'll just buy back in or spread the love to another underlying."

     "Depending on the cost basis of your shares of course...\n\nWait until a big move up on the share price. For TSLA, a 5% - 10% gain is not unheard of. Especially if it gets closer to $250 or higher per share or so before a major swing upward.\n\nSell 1 CC for your breakeven cost on the shares or ATM. This is purely to Milk the premium like you want but is going to limit capital gains on the shares if the CC expires ITM. A big move upward on the share price means IV is up too, increasing the premium even more on top of what delta is doing to drive up premiums. 180 - 365 DTE is going to get you a mountain of premium too. If TSLA continues its winning streak, sell another CC and so on. If Elon tweets something or does something stupid, buy to close one or all your CCs. Rinse and repeat.\n\nWaiting for the underlying to have a winning streak and a big gain before selling lowers the risk of selling the CC too early and missing out on the premium you could have made. 180 to 365 DTE CCs also give you a lot of money up front and a lot of time (theta decay) for the chucklefucks on Wall St to eventually bring down the underlying price so you can close out the CCs for a profit. Shorter term DTE contracts will get you more premium per week but you're running the risk of the stock shooting up after you sell with each one you sell. Buy an OTM put if you want some insurance."

     "@helicon that is certainly one way to do it but not one I would do.  Then again I have completely blown up my entire account before so getting off that ride will plant some cautious seeds.  I have been writing spreads way the hell away from the action and have done quite well on TSLA.  One example is writing the 1255 vertical when it was trading at 1380.  It want up $150-200 the next day.  Cashed out at 80%. Next day I wrote the 1600 vertical.  Cashed it out the next day at 80%.  They are not retirement trades but they add up a ton especially with some size.  The initial outlay isn\u2019t too bad and it\u2019s easy to not worry about it much.  I have no idea what the ceiling on this stock is but it is a mover.  I hope this is helpful to you.  I also hope your account survives this bold maneuver.  Cheers"

     "Just spent the weekend researching the viability of doing Reverse Iron Condors on TSLA then found this thread. It's Jan 2023 now and TSLA just spent the last year dumping from 400 to 100. Lots of movement so Reverse Iron Condors should have been a no brainer right? Unfortunately no.\n\nA mild OTM Reverse Iron Condor that needed to move 4.9% in a week for a max profit of 15% happened 36 weeks out of 52 weeks (69% of the time). That 'sounds' good until you consider the other 31% of the time the max loss was 100%. Risking $1,000 you would make $150 twice only to be slammed by a -($1,000) loss on your 3rd trade.\n\nA more OTM Reverse Iron Condor that needed to move 8.7% in a week for a max profit of 56% happened 18 weeks out of 52 weeks (35% of the time). So 1 out of 3 trades you would make $560 on $1,000 risked but the other 2 trades would suffer a -($1,000) loss each.\n\nStill going over the numbers. If I come to any more positive conclusions I will update my post.\n\nI think it pays to remember how options are priced. Your likelihood of winning is already priced into the option. They are priced in such a way the odds of making a profit consistently are against you."

     "It seems so very similar to AMZN in all of 1999.  This online bookstore went public in 98 and spent early parts of 98 at $2-3/share.  In June it jumped to the insane price of $20/share and most of the Financial Advisors were wondering what was happening with this online book store.   But then in fall/winter of 1998 it pulled a Tesla and skyrocketed to $80/share, holding there for a very short time and then crashed back to $50/share in Feb of 1999.  Between Feb and April it did what TSLA is doing now and skyrocketed to $105/share for absolutely no good reason.  Then over the summer of 99 it collapsed back to $45/share and everybody was bummed and many were wiped out.  But then in August through December it again skyrocked to $106 in early Dec of 1999.    That is pretty much like TSLA is today.  A price absolutely unhinged from reality.   AMZN then did a steady but consistent fall from $106/share to $6/share by Sept of 2001.   Most of the stockholders got wiped out.   However those that held finally got back to $106/share in late 09/early 2010.  Whew, what a long time to be totally underwater.  Of course since then they have become much more than an online book store and finally got some traction and actually started making a lot of money for people.   I think we are somewhere in the Amazon 1999/2000 equivalent period with TSLA.  There is much pain to come, but eventual profits for those that either buy in later and much lower or have incredible patience bordering on being comatose."

     "Now, I have a question about the stock repair strategy.  From what I saw on an article, say you are down 50% or so on a stock.  What you do is, buy one ATM call for every 100 shares you have, and then go .50 of the way between your ATM price and the average cost you have, and sell two OTM calls there for every 100 shares you have.  So for example, if your average cost is 30, and price is 20, you would buy one 20 call and sell two 25 calls.  The article said that you should try to do it for as close to no cost as possible, or sometimes you even get a credit.\n\nAnyway, while I've been looking around at this, I have not even seen a single case where doing so would be even close to zero cost.  I have been using all sorts of various numbers, and in no cases is buying 1 ATM call less than 2x the cost of ANY OTM calls.\n\nSo does this even work?\n\nIn every case, the ATM call is like 3x or more compared to all OTM options.  So you cannot do it and have it cost nothing, or even get a credit.  What's the problem?"

Obviously I understand the basic theoretical in that  the purchaser of the call options is increasingly likely the exercise, the further past the strike price the options go.  \nBut in a purely practical sense, what does this look like as the seller? Using a hypothetical and saying 1000 call options total have been sold for TSLA at 250 for March 17th, and say it's currently March 1st and the stock now sits at 350. Obviously, assuming the stocks don't plummet, the options are going to be exercised at some point. But let's say we have personally sold 20 of these call options (the other 980 having been sold by other sellers on various exchanges).   \nDo we simply run the risk that the specific buyers of the 20 calls that we have sold will choose to exercise their options at any given moment? How could it be distinguished which specific call buyers have the right to assign the specific options that you've sold? Can you wake up and find that half of the options you've sold have been exercised and the others have still not? I understand that assuming the stocks do not fall in value they will need to be delivered at some point prior to expiration, but the question is how this actually looks in practice.\n\nIf anyone could spell out how this actually looks from the perspective of the seller, I'd be grateful.

     "Wisest strategy on small accounts?\n\n\n\nHello! \ud83c\udfc6\nI've been absorbing a lot of theory the last 2 weeks, watching a lot of educational content on YouTube. \n\nI am European and I don't have access to a paper trading account (IBKR one is laggy af, it doesn't even load my open positions).I will probably go with TastyWorks which doesn't offer paper trading. \n\nI want to throw 1000$ in my account and learn, as I know experience is everything.\nMy goal is to make consistent monthly income within some years.\n\nNow I read about pretty much most of the strategies out there, and I think I will opt for a defined risk strategies such as spreads, selling options 30 to 45 DTE doing as much research as I can on the underlying assets beforehand.\n\nMaybe I will try PMCC once I grow my account a bit :).\n\nI've seen some people been successful trading SPX and QQQ 0DTE and 2DTE but I don't think I have the knowledge nor the experience to do that yet, please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nI've read IronCondors and IronButterfly can wipe out your account as well, so not risking that yet lol.\n\n\nI wanted to ask you guys first before jumping in and sticking to a strategy.\n\nThank you for reading ! \ud83d\ude0a"

Is there room for more gains if price continues to increase? \\n\\nObviously I dont want to exercise 1.6MM in TSLA shares. \\n\\nThank you \\n\\n\\nEvening EDIT: sold 15 at open @ $17 and then kept trying to catch the falling knife with the other 15. Overall a 75% return vs the 400% i was hoping for. Disappointing but still a successful trade\\n\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/F40V7CY'",

Left just enough $ i figured I'd YOLO a solid portion into a Option for one of the top trading securities. Hadn't traded TSLA in awhile, was playing around on the options chain, found a position that seemed appealing and bought it. As soon as i bought it i realized i had made a mistake. \n\nI was originally looking for 4/24 calls, but after changing some of the viewing columns up on the options chain, i guess the page reloaded and defaulted on showing 4/3 options instead of the 4/24 positions i was just at. Accidentally bought a 505C for 4/3 as opposed to 4/24 like intended... From market open  to close today i was constantly wondering if i should cut losses and sell it while i could, or grow bigger balls and hold it through.\n\nI held it through and watch my portfolio drop all day. After hours trading, my portfolio ended getting to 40%+\n\nshit was hilarious to be apart of. Gonna be rolling in some tendies tomorrow whether i close at open or later in the day"

If TSLA does go bankrupt...there may not be any shares at all.  I suppose TSLA could tank and be worth $50/share in the next year...maybe then the puts would be worth more.\\n\\nJust seems kind of funny and odd to me.\\n\\nMaybe it's just people taking a bearish position...but it seems like a better way to do that would be to sell a bear put debit spread at a strike of 50 or 100.

When a short Call or Put goes ITM, is there a definitive term for the difference between the strike price and the assigned price?\r  \n\r  \nI use my own visual slang for this measure. For short PUTs, I use the term \"blowthrough\" as in it blew through my expected strike and landed in my account. For CCALLs, I use the term \"spew\" as I picture all the dollars I missed out on spewing out the top of my strike price into the air.  Slightly stupid sounding I admit but it helps me keep the numbers straight in my head. \r  \n\r  \nAs a further example. If I have a CSP on XOM for $100 and it expires ITM at 99.00, that's $1 (and 1%) of \"blowthrough\". If I have a CC on XOM with $100 strike and it expires at $101, that's $1 (and again 1%) of \"spew\". Since I'm running a modified wheel strategy, limiting both of these numbers is my goal. I'm just wondering if they have actual accepted terms in market parlance."

     "Hi guys,\r  \nI just want to learn a little more about options trading, particularly covered calls. I have XXX shares of a stock and been selling weekly covered calls +5$ above the current price.\r  \n\r  \nMy question is - what happens when my covered calls go \"ITM\" (In the money), and the \"person\" who bought my calls, doesn't have enough funds to exercise? Does this mean it just expires worthless and I'm off the hook? Or does the broker just exercise on their behalf and pocket the difference? I think that last sentence is my misconception. What happens to the ITM covered calls?\r  \n\r  \nThank you for your time. Sorry if this is a stupid question. I've read that there's an X% chance they get assigned, and I've read that ITM covered calls are always exercised if ITM. I'm just really confused at this point."

It's VXX which is pretty high volume so buying that underlying automatically to sell, at mid or mid less a penny is pretty safe (1 cent bid ask spreads usually), if  I can set that.\n\nBut is this available?

     "I placed a short vertical on SPX right at Powell speech, I ended up being completely wrong and should have lost money, but the trade profited way over the max profit, what did I do wrong?\n\nI thought the market was going to spike briefly and then drop after JP's speech so I set up a short vertical spread with two triggers (a stop-loss and a take-profit). I was way wrong obviously, the market rallied, but somehow my P/L is $17,100???\n\n\r  \nAs you can see below, I sold ten of March 10 SPX vertical at 4110/4120 strike, at a 6.00 limit. I set a take profit at 3.00 limit to buy back the contract at 50% profit, and a limit stop loss at mark price of the underlying at 4110 with a limit offset of 0.10 just to ensure I would get filled (so that my max loss would be nearly equivalent to the credit I received from the spread).\n\n\r  \nAnyway it gets filled and the market instantly starts ripping upwards. I was disappointed but did not close early, had already decided to leave emotions out, stick to my strategy, and either let it hit my stop-loss or my take-profit.\n\n\r  \nSo SPX promptly hits 4110 (which was my stop loss) and I go to my positions to see the damage, only to find that not only are ALL THREE of my positions are somehow open, but my profit is over 10k. After a long confused pause I scrambled to close my position.\n\n\r  \nI entered a closing trade for all 3 and they get filled, but then after looking again to make sure, I still have an open bought vertical somehow?? I fumbled around thinkorswim for two minutes with panic rising and unable to understand what I have done, figured I had to just close the position so I picked the opposite of my position and just blindly submitted it at the default mark limit, and it filled quickly.\n\n\r  \nNow finally with all the positions closed I am looking at $17,100 profit in about ten minutes. What have I done? I don't get it at all. It was a short vertical spread so understand that my MAX PROFIT on this trade should have been 6k, and that was only if SPX stayed below 4110 all the way until March 10th and then the contract expires worthless, which wouldn't have happened anyway because I set a take profit at 50% so my max profit if I absolutely nailed this trade should have been 3k.\r  \n\n\nEntry:   SOLD -10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/13.70\n\nStop loss: BOT +10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/1.00\n\nTake profit: BOT +10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/1.00\n\nclosed my accidental open position: SOLD -10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/5.40"

So i thought- Great!\n\nOn robinhood I could buy to close the option as soon as it expired-becuase I thought I was supposed to let it expire worthless...maybe I did it wrong....Robinhood still has my collateral listed as a negative in my buying power.\n\nSo when do I get the collateral back?  \nDo I wait until Monday morning to get that money back?  \nI was trying to start a Wheel Strategy and I thought I had done it completely right-contract expired worthless and I collected the premium and strike wasn't met.  \n\n\nIf I could just get some info on what to do or what is going on that would be great!  \nThanks!"

How do you set these up?\n\n\nI got an email from Schwab suggesting that I might like \"Cash-Secured Equity Puts\" based on my account activity.\n\n\nMy investing strategy is pretty straight-forward. I set multiple limit orders at today's price less a discount of 5/10/15%, good for 60 days.\n\n\nFor example, I want to purchase an ETF or a dividend aristocrat stock XYZ which has a 52 week trading range between $80-110 and today's price is $100. I'll set limit orders of $95, $90, and $85, all good for 60 days. If the market dips, then my orders will execute and I'll buy at a discount. These investments will be held 30+ years.\n\n\nI repeat this activity every 60-90 days, or whenever I have time. Schwab is suggesting that I try Cash-Secured Equity Puts because that's essentially what I'm already doing but not receiving the trade premium income ... or something like that.\n\n\nCan someone please \"explain like I am 5\" how to set up a cash secured equity put for the above example?\n\n\nFull disclosure: I am a CPA & MBA but also an idiot."

So if my put ended up ITM and triggered a sale, I wouldn't end up short VXX, but rather my long itm call would trigger a simultaneous buy to offset? I know my concern about avoiding assignment isn't a great reason for a strategy, and the move/down gain on put would be offset by call value loss, but the premium difference would be what I was looking for....VXX puts often underpriced IMO.\n\nAm I getting the mechanics of this right, and is there a name for it?

If Tesla were to Enron itself and completely disappear in two years (anything can happen, I suppose, and you don't know what you don't know) your max loss would be $500 - $24 = $476 per contract less commissions paid to STO.\n\nThe best case scenario is you make 2.4% nominal per year. The average market return is 8-11%. I don't like to use the phrase \"picking up nickels in front of a steamroller\" but this really seems like it. Because you face the risk of near-total principal loss to get a sub-market return, whereas with a CD you do not face the risk of loss of principal AT ALL (FDIC insurance).\n\nYou could sell $5 puts on plenty of other stocks, I do cash-secured puts in my portfolio and sometimes when I have like a grand left I'll sell two Ford $5 puts just so that more of my money is working. I have owned Ford before and wouldn't mind buying it for $5, but I've also held it and watched it do nothing so I'd rather wheel it than BTH."

I was lucky enough to get into tsla early and I have faith long term, but was curious if there's an option strategy I should research to access some cash without losing shares. I did sell some covered LEAPS which went way in the money and gave me a heart attack, but I held and the recent plummet saved my shares. In retrospect, perhaps being exercised would have been great :) \n\nAny pointers at what a newb should look into? About 2k shares held long-term."

     "Hi. I am very new to options. I THINK I understand a basic call option. I did a small one last week and made a little money. \n\nI am now trying to verify how a call option works if I am ITM and decide that I want to exercise my option early and buy the stock.  So I made up this example just to be sure I have the steps and results correct to do this\u2026 I know my numbers are not realistic, but I really just want to make sure I understand the process.\n\nSo here\u2019s my example:\n\nXYZ Corp currently trading at $10/share\n\nBuy 5 call contracts of XYZ CORP @ $2.50 each with a $6/share strike point = $1,250.00 Premium paid\n \n1 week later:\n \nXYZ Corp trading @ $12/share - I choose to Exercise my option to buy the shares. Cost = $3000.00\n\nNow here\u2019s where I get confused: when I exercise to buy, I think it\u2019s different than if I just sell for the contract profit. Right? So I\u2019m not sure how much I get for owning the contract for 1 week - so I\u2019m just going to make up a number and say I get $500. \n\nSo I exercise and get $500 from contract. I would think that the $500 is applied to the amount I owe to buy the stock. So I also have to put up $2500 cash to complete the transaction. \n \nSo now I own the stock. \n \n1 day later:\n \nXYZ Corp trading @ $11/share - I sell 500 shares that I bought at $6/share for $11.00/share = $6,600\n \nSummary:\nI paid $1,250 + $3,000 = $4,250.00\nIn the end after selling the stock I receive $6,600\nSo I made a profit of $2,350\n \nBTW, I\u2019m not saying this would be the best way to do this, selling the contract might very well be a more profitable play. But I just want to know if I have the theory correct. \n \nSo these are the steps I see:\n\n1. Buy the contract paying the premium\n \n2. Exercise my option early and buy the stock.\n \n3. Sell the stock for more than what I paid for it. \n\nDo I understand this correctly?\n\nThanks for listening."

     "Probably a dumb question that I should know because I do a decent amount of options, but what is the downside of setting a really low strike point on selling a covered call as long as it is above my cost basis?\n\nFor instance, I own 100 shares of carnival (CCL). My cost basis is $8.00. The current stock price is around $11.00. Beyond losing out on any further increase in stock, what is the downside of selling a covered call with a strike price of $9.00? The premiums I was looking at was around .35 or $350 for the entire contract.\n\nSo I would lose the value of $2 per stock based on the price of the stock (Eleven (current value) minus Nine (the strike price) equals two), but get an extra $1.50 for each one based on the premium.\n\nAm I dumb for considering doing this? I would get $100 based from the rise in the value of the stock, and then an extra $325 for setting the strike below the current market rate. That sounds pretty good for an initial $800 investment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I meant $3.50 premium, not .35."

I just discovered this sub and made my first ever reddit account a few days ago.\n\nI'm new to options and so far, the only trade I made was buying to open a single call option and then selling to close it before expiration just to get a feel for it.  So, if this question is profoundly stupid, I apologize in advance.\n\nLet's say that I want to write and sell a far dated covered call option.  Let's say the expiration is 6 months out but I guess it really doesn't matter whether it's far dated or not in the context of my question.  I have no margin at all on my account just as a FYI.  Would this be a \"Sell to open covered\" trade?  That's what shows up on my broker's platform.\n\nAnd let's say that after I write and sell a covered call option and I collect the premium on it.  Then as long as the covered call I sold and already collected the premium on is not ITM and is not assigned, is it then possible for me to sell the contract I hold at all or do I have to hold it until expiration or until assignment?\n\nIf this is possible, then what Order Type would I choose?  On my platform, I have:\n\"Buy to open\"\n\"Sell to close\"\n\"Sell to open covered\"\n\"Buy to close covered\"\n\nIf this is not possible at all and is one of the most ridiculous questions ever asked in here, again, I'm sorry, but would still appreciate an answer."

My question is what is the probability this gets an early assignment? In other words what are chances my 100 shares of Tesla get sold at $970 BEFORE market close 11/5? Ive been told that deep ITM calls get assigned early but Ive held this CC for a 1.5 weeks deep ITM. If early assignments are rare it seems its smart to just roll out to another ITM CC slightly further out. This will give Tesla a chance to fall down to a spot where I can exit for cheap or just keep rolling it out till my strike is no longer ITM. Thoughts?'",

So I got $265 credit with max loss of $400. SPY closed at 408 Friday and my assumption is vertical movement. \n  I understand if both contacts expire OTM I keep the credit and ITM I have to close and spend $400. I am less clear about what happens if they expire somewhere in between (let\u2019s say 405) and how I would close the contracts. \n   My main question, however is this: The 407C is trading for 5.83 and 403C for 8.52.  Assuming I can fill these positions, I can close these contracts for $269, four dollars more than what i paid. I could then slide the spread higher to sell the 408C and buy the 412C. To me this seems like a pretty obvious adjustment that puts me in a better position. Am I missing something? What would be the disadvantage of this adjustment? \nThank you!"

I'm buying a new contract at a new price that PERSON B is writing for the same security.\n\nDoes a computer just automatically change the database linking between me and PERSON A to PERSON B and PERSON A? Is that done at the brokerage level, or clearinghouse level, or at OCC, or somewhere else? Is it done immediately or when the option expires? Does anyone here really know how this actually works?\n\nI've always been curious, but now it's relevant for me. I sold some GOOG March 3 Puts $94 in Vanguard. I then initiated an ACATS from Vanguard to tastyworks. Both brokerages said I couldn't do anything with the option while they were in transit until Feb 15. Since Google has declined, I want to close the puts at a profit, not wait until Feb 15. Tastyworks said I could buy the same number of GOOG March 3 Puts $94 in their account, then once the ACATS completed, they would all disappear (since the -# of written puts transferring in would balance the # of puts in the account).\n\nOn one level, that makes sense, but they hadn't seen it before, and I was wondering if anyone understood how it would technically transpire. Vanguard holds its own securities. Tastyworks holds them at Apex Clearinghouse. Who would be responsible for matching up the # and -# of puts to cancel them out (and record a realized profit for taxes)?"

Keep experimenting with it and to ensure your profitble my hard rule is selling CC at break even price or above. Another tip, when VIX is higher Volatility increases and so price of options increases which is ideal for CC.  I would  sell CC at varying price and varying times which means I would not enter int 11 contracts in 1 trade."

The tl;dr is that on expiration day, if a stock closes right around the strike price of your short option (including AH trading), you won't know whether you've been assigned on your short option until Saturday. At that point, it's too late to exercise your long option. So you're now either long or short 100 shares of the underlying. If the stock gaps up or down Monday morning, you have to cover at whatever the new price is. If it's moved against you, you could take a big loss.\n\nConversely, if you tell your broker on Friday to exercise your long option, you won't know whether you've been assigned on the short option until Saturday. If you weren't assigned on the short but you exercised the long, you're now either long or short 100 shares and have the same issue.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/hdyddu/the_lesser_known_dangers_of_credit_spreads_i/"

     "Not even remotely Robinhood\u2019s fault.  First, auto-exercise is only based on regular trading closing price.  It is up the the friend to monitor AH trading and act accordingly (e.g., exercise the long puts).  Better yet:  close the positions (it goes without saying that you have to do this during regular trading hours but given what happened here, I\u2019m just making sure).  Second, Robinhood doesn\u2019t receive notice of the short puts being exercised right away (and assigned to the friend); rather, the OCC receives exercise instructions and then randomly selects a broker with a short contract holder, which may or not be the same broker from which the exercise instruction originated.  Then the selected broker selects, typically randomly, a contract holder for assignment...this is not an immediate process (the broker won\u2019t even know until AH trading has closed) so there is nothing for the broker to react to.  Third, it only takes a sliver of forethought to figure out what pin risk is without even having to read about it.  On a volatile stock such as TSLA, your short can be pinned quite some distance out.  Fourth, and with respect, the actions taken by the friend here demonstrate nothing more than ignorance of the exercise and assignment process, as well as the risk of spreads and almost how options work in general.  It\u2019s an expensive lesson but that takes me back to point three above:  Just thinking forward a little bit and asking questions about the position should have been enough here.  For example, what if the underlying does X, Y, or Z?  How does that affect the position?  Instead, the friend is surprised that the broker didn\u2019t do this for him.  Lastly, the friend\u2019s account not being a margin account does not insulate the friend from losses.  I wish the \u201cfriend\u201d best of luck."

They are all bid up. What does that mean? It means that the market **believes** there is news coming out that will move this stock before the 5:30pm option notice deadline. If I were short any TSLA options, I would not have gone away at 4:02pm and start the Labor Day weekend. I would have waited for news and acted accordingly.\n\nTLDR...  Although I am smart, I am not smarter than the market. On a normal expiration, out of the money options should have minimal bids (0.01 or 0.05 or 0.10 etc ) and not $1 bids or $2 bids.

     "The correct answer is IV. I posted this answer a couple of days ago, but I think it applies to help you here: \n\nIV is created by bidders inflating the option beyond it's fair value. In an options pricing model like BSM or Stensland, the option has a fair value according to underlying's price, DTE, strike price, and the risk free interest rate (there are also differences in the calculation of early exercise, but don't focus on that). The remainder of the option's price then is IV. As an underlying's price moves in a direction or is anticipated to move in a direction, bidders suddenly appear at particular strikes, causing the price to move upward. Usually this correlates to an event like earnings, unexpected news, or in this case the underlying doubling... \"IV Crush\" then is experienced when the bidders suddenly disappear from that option, thereby causing the IV portion of the price to collapse, coming back closer to fair value. **IV is the reason then that an options price can seem to be non-sensical in such that a put can gain value when the underlying goes up, or a call gaining value when the price moves down, going against the normal pricing expectation.** Traders can capitalize on this IV inflation by actually selling the volatility in the option, and then as the IV disappears, they can buy back the option for a profit.\r  \n\r  \nHope that helps the understanding."

     "I am going to be a bit of a contrarian here:\n\nTSLA IV did not go through any kind of shift today that would allow one to say \"this was due to IV.\" I doubt that TSLA IV changed at all today. Also a stock that deep in the money would not be much affected by IV even if it did shift. So IMO that is not the answer.\n\nI honestly think that you got your comparison wrong. TSLA was essentially even today and the call option was up around 3% to 4%.  But there is a nearly a $2 spread between bid and ask so the actual paper gain or loss is going to depend upon whatever you assume about the appropriate peg. The assumption that it can be calculated mid-price between bid and ask is not appropriate for an option that ditm.\n\nI regard this as a fairly risky bet. TSLA doesn't have to fall 15% for you to lose money - and if there is a negative tail event taking it more than 15%, you lose everything.\n\nWhy didn't you consider a put credit spread - quite a bit safer than this?

Tesla climbing 5.9% in any given week seems highly probable (TSLA moving +4% in 5 days has been one standard deviation historically), and if it did climb that high by 2/12 or 2/19, then you would have the opportunity to sell your next call at a better strike price at that point in time?"

     "Hi everyone, this might be a bit long, just sharing my option trading experience for the past 7 months and would like some advice/insight/opinion and probably what would you do if you were me:\n\nI learned the Wheel from here and I gave it a try back in July last year, where I found a stock trading @ around $26 that time and did a 1 Short Put contract next month @ 25 for $1.25, if I was right I remember it was a 5% return for premium if I didn't get assigned. Anyway the stock market never works the way I think it would, and I got assigned @ $25 and have been holding the shares until now.\n\nI started working the Wheel, kept doing Short Calls every month, the worst moment was the stock was down to $14, but my Short Call was doing alright, even when it reached $14 I am still like breakeven in the case if I sell all my shares @ $14. Sometimes I am forced to roll up because I am too close to the strike price, but nothing serious so far so good.\n\nUntil the end of December, the stock market started to rebound, at that time the stock price was around $21, and was seeing a lot of big green days. I also learned this from Reddit, the best time to do Short Call is during the big green day, and I been seeing a lot 5% 10% rebound in a day for this stock, so I tried to be safe, did 35 contracts of Short Call @ $28 expires 30th January for like pennies, hoping there is no way to rebound 33% by end of January.\n\nAgain the stock market never works the way I think it would, this month I didn't have much sleep lol, the only good night sleep I can have is during the weekend where the market won't open in the next morning. I watched it climb step by step every 3 days, $22, $24, and then to my Short Put assigned price $25, last week was $26, then last Friday was $27.5 geez. And the price for today is $28.3 lol. Still got 2 more trading days left before expiration, but I couldn't watch it anymore, and I can't guarantee the stock will close below $28 next Monday, so I closed all my Short Call contracts and am now lining up for next month February with lesser contracts Short Calls. With my Short Call winnings for the past 7 months, and with the shares I already have from $25, I don't really need to do a lot of Short Call contracts for February to make up the loss.\n\nSince I only got assigned for 1 contract @ $25 seven months ago, when I did 35 contracts Short Call I was using a margin account. I never really done that many before, and I learned that I need some sort of security deposit in the account to allow me to do so. And during mid January, when it was very volatile, the trading system helped me close positions automatically due to lack of funds in the account. Sometimes I can react in time and make deposits to avoid closing automatically (back then I still believed there was no way it's gonna reach $28). And those deposits weren't cheap, in total I had to chip in another 130K into the account just to stop it from closing more of the contracts.\n\nThe question and advice I am asking here is what would you have done if you were me?\n\n1. Why I did 35 contracts for pennies back then was I was trying to make back some loss from other trades I done before.\n2. I did thought of rolling up during mid January, but back then the option prices were way too high, not realistic at all, so I waited till the last week of this month, hoping the time value goes down, and when I close the positions today, it was at least 100% cheaper if I close during mid January (and back then it was just $25, still thinking no way it will reach $28)\n3. Another dumb thing I should have used my 130k funds better was to invest in other stocks instead of working on this Wheel and miss out opportunities. Although that's true, I didn't have the time to study other stocks and was very busy with my business.         \n\nAnyway I just want to share my experience and would like any input and opinions on how I can improve. Need to learn from my mistakes."

     "1 \uff09Is the leverage effect of options gets higher    ,  when  higher  the  price above the buy price  ?\n\nI bought an ETH call option when ETH is at around 1558usd.

     "I don't have anyone around who knows anything about stocks and options, so I'm hoping that strangers on the internet can help me. So, without further ado:\n\nFord is currently trading at $12.85 as of this post.\nA $12.50 put for 02/03 sells for 26\u00a2 per share. \nA $13 call for 02/03 sells for 40\u00a2 per share. \nWe'll assume for the sake of conversation that F doesn't crash. \n\nIf I sell a put, and it doesn't get exercised, I keep the full $1250 ($12.50 per share, 100 shares), $26 of which is pure profit. \n\nIf it does get exercised, I now have one call that I can mark out as a $13 call, sell it for the next week, and if it executes, I get the $1250, which is already $25 more than I paid, plus the $40 up front. If my call doesn't get exercised, I keep both the money, and my stock.\n\nIf I can't find a buyer at a higher breakeven than I paid, I can sell my call at $3 two years from now, pocket $970 up front, and still call it a victory, since the $3 call means I'm out at most $300 per contract. Which is a lot, but still only 1/4 what I paid, and more than enough to start over with another company.\n\nSo, if I'm understanding all this right, the only risk I take is \"oh, I wound up bagholding like 25% of my investment, but the other 75% is still cash profit (assuming I've moved enough F to cover my initial puts and am now back in the black from selling in in the first place). That risk is mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, by due diligence.\n\nIt seems like as long as the breakeven on the call you sold is higher than your average paid from selling the put that got you the call, the only risk is tanking stock. Profits might not be massive, but they're consistent, and an exit strategy (if F drops below $10 I get out) can (mostly) protect me from a tank. \n\nPlease, somebody tell me where I'm wrong in all this, because everyone I know is telling me I'm wrong, but nobody, myself included, can find the flaw. I know there's a whole world of nuance where gigantic amounts of money can be made and lost in a heartbeat, but I don't want gigantic amounts of money, I want to stop being homeless."

I'm fairly new to options, so I'm sticking with cheap calls and covered calls with low cost while learning the cycles and greeks and all.

They've announced a reverse stock split, that I'm pretty sure will bring my 500 shares down to 100 (or maybe even less, don't know yet). Does anyone know what happens to my cc's if the number of shares is cut before they expire? \n\nThe second one, last year I had bought a couple OTM calls that grew ITM then hovered. They've announced a large new issuance at about 3/4 of it's current share price, making my calls useless. I guess my question is similar to above - do any adjustments get made for options, or is this value change just part of the risk? \n\nI'm thinking adjustments have to happen if the change affects my number of shares, but not if it just affect the value of shares.

If you look at a chart this stock has hit strong resistance every month last year July, Aug, Sept.. Oct, Nov .. it gets up to around 11 ish and then drops..\n\nMy one choice is to just let my shares be taken at 8.50 strike  I make profit anyway because I got my cost basis down to $8.15 ,\n\nOr I can relax and wait until Friday gets near and see if this stock drops from 11 ish resistance again.. if so buying back the calls will be cheaper if it drops alot, or I can  roll the calls Friday at a higher strike price  a month or two out depending on where the stock price currently is.\n\nI guess I can let the shares be taken away if Friday comes and the stock is still high because Im not paying 2.58 per call to buy them back. .thats 500 dollars Im giving back.

     "Newish options trader here, ive been paper trading for about 6 months with consistent gains. I created a throw away here, so I can talk about my assets and portfolio and my strategy for feedback. Im primarily a real estate investor with 30 units owned outright and about 2 million in equity. My cashflow is around 10K a month to play with. I still work a full-time W2 position making 155K per anum. So this 10K a month of REI cashflow I can leverage without any real regard for safety into more capital, hence why im doing options, I dont rely on the money outside of investment.\n\nI picked up a scanner a while back for a few hundred bucks, and run my own through finviz. Generally ive been trading things like spy, qqq, nvda, msft, tsla etc... looking for volatility. Ive been waiting for open, wait for volatility to subside somewhat and find a clear direction. Ive been using MACD, RSI and MA 200 as far as technical indicators. At the start of the move I think its going to make ive been just buying calls or puts trying to keep it simple. I understand the more complicated options strategies and tried them, but honestly I have had way more success in my paper account with calls/puts maybe 3rd on up or down on the options chain in the intended direction.\n\nI keep resetting the account, but I have been starting with 25K, and pushing that to 200K before I reset the balance. Ive done this enough times now I feel comfortable putting my cash in, and going at it. When the trade starts going against me i cut my losses immediately, if its moving fast I do a market order, if its a slow mover i try and get filled with a limit order. So ill take a bunch of small losses, before I hit a big move either up or down with a call or put, and then I close it out around 3/4 of where I think it will hit. Ive only been trading between 930-1030 but generally im done around 10 and restart the next day. I tried trading outside this window and it does not work out. Most of the options Im trading are between 0dte and 1 week dte.\n\nIm fine with the risk reward, luck aspects of this strategy because I am able to lose the cash without any negative consequences, and it can help me drum up more capital for real estate investments that will cashflow. I think once I get the account to 200, I will scoop it into my business account, and then start fresh with 25K and keep doing that.\n\nI do not like option selling or credit spreads, or longer dated options because to me it feels like all of that is subject to way more manipulation by the market makers, then just scalping 0dte options. I tried them on paper, kept spreadsheets and it just seemed like a slower way to lose money tbh. With day trading calls and puts its a way more binary win lose, and ive been able to win more than lose so far. My experience with leaps, wheel strat and some of the others has led me to the conclusion that the reward is not worth the amount of risk with them. If im going to assume risk, I want the full reward.\n\nLooking for feedback on the strategy, but im essentially just day trading normal options."

I compared buying ATM spreads (with the short leg at the expected move) vs calls and puts at those expected moves (25 delta-ish) and how close they are in price. This is useful not just in TSLA but in any stock where options prices are expensive (dollar wise) and people ending up making bad decisions because of that. Full post here, no paywall as always.

I once tried to make a similar calculation integrating the profit over probability distribution to see which options were most profitable which I could share, but this seems truer to reality. Anecdotally, it's way easier to profit by selling options far OTM or buying options close to the money or even ITM."

     "Other replies have addressed the mechanical reasons why infinite rolling will eventually hit a wall. I'd like to address the mindset problem.\n\nBeing an average, humble trader that just wants a decent trade \"once and a while,\" doesn't require optimizing the hell out of every trade. But \"doesn't require\" isn't the same thing as \"blindly ignore,\" let alone \"intentionally make bad decisions.\"  Focusing on the outcome of a single trade is a very bad habit for any trader. It can lead to [results-oriented thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/) as well as [loss aversion bias](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/content/loss-aversion-bias) and chasing profits at any cost.\n\nSo my problem with the idea of rolling that one trade until it finally wins is that it misses the forest for the trees. A better mindset is to be indifferent to the outcome of a single trade and focus more on your average results over many trades. Over 100 would be good. Over 1000 would be better. Over 10,000 would be great. Averages are what matter. Averages are how you converge on the expected value you planned for and targeted. Averages are what separate profitable traders from one-hit wonders."

Keep in mind that provided the stock is above the strike price the trade will start to profit at some point.  There should be no rush to roll if the option is not ATM or ITM.  With TSLA around $172 your Apr 150 put is not at risk right now.  You don't include the credit you got, but calculating the breakeven price including that credit will find the BEP somewhere around $145.  \n\nThe other thing is that rolling can be very helpful but can also move the trade out in time to keep it open longer that can reduce the profit per day.  I prefer trades that do not get challenged and just close for a 50% profit, so I like to get out of these problem trades as soon as possible and not let them hang around too long.  \n\nYou opened this trade around the 45 dte so it might not profit until opened for 10 or more days.

Anyone who bought the rumour and doesn't care about Tesla long term will probably be selling because for them, the hype about inclusion is over and the music has stopped. \n\nIf I were playing Tesla (other than being long shares and not selling until Im a boomer and need divys), I would probably continue shorting condors and hoping to win off the crush.

Sure you just did a few good spins and it\u2019s ripping, but after a few seconds (or whatever) it loses momentum. \n\nBut, if something does stir it, volatility will pick up again (and fast). What makes IV great is that when IV spikes, it expands almost consistently since wild swings both ways help. \n\nGoing long theta and long delta is the best long term move for TSLA, while shorting volatility. Because of this, call debit spreads or put credit spreads are probably the preferred TSLA strat."

     "**NOTES AND EDITS:**\n\n1. Use of the word \"Decay\": as it has been correctly pointed out I should've used the word contraction.\n2. $TSLA stock price: we are not here discussing if the price will go up or down. I am trying to elaborate a discussion about Implied Volatility which is determined by the price of options and not the price of the stock. If you don't have something useful to add to this technical conversation it is better that you ask questions or just read but don't add speculation or link to your youtube channel that no one wants to see. Lol\n3. What strucks me a bit of the contraction of Implied Volatility just before the event is that it signals \"complacency\" to me. If we had a big risk of a big drop the price of Puts would be through the rough, but it's not. Neither is the price of calls anymore. They were last week. So this contraction is not pricing in a direction, but rather looks like people are like \"no idea what's gonna happen bro,\" or assuming a somewhat steady price. Or else volatility would be much higher.\n4. I hold $TSLA call spreads but I was waiting to sell premium this week and I am frustrated because volatility piked last week and has dropped by 50% this week (from a high IV rank of 56 to 25). This drop in volatility to lows for Tesla while the VIX is in its 20s makes it even dangerous to sell Tesla premium. I even noticed Tom Sosnoff frustrated about this on Tastytrade live both Monday and Tuesday.\n\nI find implied volatility fascinating and it is is one of our biggest allies as options traders so I love this conversation. Thanks everyone for commenting and please keep the convo going :)"

I am debating if I should hold my position and write options for July (805 strike has a premium of $140.25 or Jan 2022 805 strike for $218) or take a loss and sell the shares. I know there is going to be a lot of volatility in the short term, but I think Tesla is a long term play.

     "A few thoughts in more detail below, but you got very lucky. Don't count on trades like this working out for you in the future.\n\n* From how you described it, you didn't actually make a mistake. It sounds like you fully intended to buy the calls after already having the IC open, right? The fact that you already had a short call position at the 1050 strike doesn't matter. Whether you're buying 2 calls to go from a position of -2 to 0 or from a position of 0 to 2, it's the same change in exposure.\n* That being said, it's not clear to me what the logic behind buying the 1050 calls was. It sounds like it was just a bet that the underlying would go up, which is inconsistent with the thesis behind an IC, which is that the underlying will stay rangebound. You got lucky that the underlying went up significantly. If the underlying had gone down instead of further up like it actually did, or even just gone up a small amount, you could easily have had a loss, especially with something as volatile as TSLA.\n* It can be very dangerous to leg out of a spread or IC like you did. The point of an IC is that the different legs offset each other. When you remove a leg, the overall position becomes much more exposed and sensitive to directional movements in the underlying. You got lucky that this worked out in your favor here, but it could have easily gone in the other direction. You profited from the long call leg of your IC gaining a lot in value as the underlying went further up, while you didn't have a short call leg whose value would drop at the same time to offset it. Consider if the underlying had gone down instead. The remaining long call would have dropped in value much harder than if you had both a short and long call, since there would have been no corresponding gain from a short call to help offset the loss from the long call.\n* Different people have different strategies and risk appetites, but I also really don't like the initial IC trade. It's incredibly narrow for an IC, and with something as volatile as TSLA, you're looking at a very high probability that the IC ends up at max loss on one side or the other."

     "Is there a way to forego the increase in value of a put option as the underlying approaches the strike price, in exchange for paying less for that option up front?\n\nI understand that at expiration, the strike price forms a clear boundary between an option having value and being worthless. But I would like the option to function in that manner all the way up until that time, if I can get it for cheaper (or offset the cost with a sale).\n\nSo let's say I am in a stock that is trading at $100 a share, and I want insurance to \"kick in\" if it goes below $90, but am okay with that insurance being worth zero at any price point above that.\n\nNormally if I buy a put with a 90 strike and the stock goes down to $95, the put would be worth more than what I paid (assuming enough time is left until expiration). But I want to forego all of that increase (is that called \"time premium\" perhaps?) if I can pay as little as possible for that option at the point of purchase. (I understand that \"paying less\" may translate into me selling a different option to offset the cost of the put.)\n\nThen, as soon as the stock goes to $89.99, I'd like to have the fair value of that option kick in at that point. But anything above $90, it's okay if it's worthless, for the entire life of the contract.\n\nI hope this isn't stupid. It was a much more concise question in my head!"

Or do you have different approaches for different strategies?\n\nHelpful resources like books or livestream or YT videos? I personally learn best from real life examples but then again\u2026limited experience."

Also I was watching a podcast that mentioned part of the spike was institutions selling deep ITM puts, and rolling them, collecting income and not having to worry about counterparty doing early exercise.  They stated it's a neutral strategy, not bearish, because you have to hold the underlying.\n\nCBOE actually commented on this P/C ratio spike and confirmed deep ITM put on tech like AMZN : https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/how-early-exercise-order-flow-impacts-equity-option-put-call-ratios/\n\nI understand early exercise rarely happens because you're throwing away extrinsic value, but for deep ITM, you have more intrinsic over extrinsic.  \n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around it.  If you own 200 shares of ABC at current price $100\n\n- sell 2 deep ITM put options with strike $120 \n- collect premium of $20 each (2 * 20 = $40 total premium received) \n- ABC goes down, puts go up in value, you're losing on both stock and option, counterparty is winning\n- ABC goes up, puts go down in value, you're winning on both stock and option, counterparty is losing\n\nAs long as ABC does not go below $100, the trade is profitable for you?

     "I have been paper trading for a few weeks with a specific strategy. I can't imagine that this is real, but I've had huge success with it. I'm buying vertical spreads on SPY deep ITM which expire same day. Basically, I looked back in time and found that the S&P doesn't often fall more than 2% in any given day. I buy a spread first thing in the morning at 2% below opening or even lower if it's dropped already for the day.\n\nI'm buying 10 contracts for $4,000 - $4,500. I then put a sell limit a little above that, say $4,200 - $4,700. Most days I make about $1,000 after buying/selling multiple times. I risk about $4,000 at a time. I've had a few hit expiration as well. Even on negative market days, I'm winning.\n\nTell me why this is working so easily in paper trading and why it's not just that easy to make money. I've read a little on the subject but haven't seen anything quite specific enough to convince me of the reason.\n\nWhat I've come up with is that when I'm buying a contract, in the real world I'd have to have a seller at my price. In paper trading, I don't need a real seller. It just happens if the price hits my limit. The same would be true for selling then. Is this a correct understanding?"

     "I had call options for a security that would expire on the 20th of Jan 23 At the strike price of 2,5. I asked the broker how can i exercise the options to buy the stock before expiration. I was told it was not possible on their platform. At that time i was Ok with this as i was bullish on the performance, but disappointed as i never saw anything that it would not be possible. The reason i would have wanted to buy the stock was because the market price was 20x the strike price and selling the options would not have resulted in any meaningful profits as they were still extremely cheap.\n\nFew days later i get a margin call. I notice my balance was negative. I immediately sent them a message and email asking what was happening as i never used margin and only had bought call options. Next thing i know they are closing my positions to cover the margin call. I called the broker to ask what is happening as this was impossible.\n\nThey said there had been an error in their platform resulting in them giving me 10x More options than i had paid for, and the price updated a few days later which caused a margin call. The Person on the phone was very helpful so i asked a few questions about trading options on their platform. She told me that it was possible to exercise the options early to buy the stock and told me how to do it: message them and give the instructions. (Previously was told it was not possible) also other questions i had about how they handle itm call option expiry as i was led to believe my only option was to sell the option or let it expire, so naturally i wanted to know how they handle expiry. She gave me an answer which was how i originally expected it to work but again was led to believe something else would happen as i had asked this before.\n\nNow the issue for me is that at the moment i cannot do anything as majority of my positions have been closed. But i am still negative balance as the same 10x issue is with selling the options. For example, Previously 20 dollar premium became 200 days after transaction, now the same security was sold for the same price as a part of the margin call by the risk management but the account received 20 dollars which would not be enough to cover the margin deficit. This will probably be fixed later. \n\nTldr, broker accidentally gave me 10x More call options which few days later caused a margin call which caused them to close my positions after which i learned that i could have went along with my original strategy after they had misled me to believe it was not possible on their platform (it was possible) and now i have lost almost all positions which i could have turned into approx. 3m profit. Atm waiting for their reply\n\nAny suggestions?"

Based off these market moves, the maintenance req expansion seems very reasonable/predictable.

     "Question on how Robinhood (or other brokers) represent options value in your account.\n\nI think i have an idea of how this works but I've always been curious. As\u00ed understand it, when I sell a put or a call the premium comes directly to me at the time of sale and becomes cash i can use. However, i am now linked to the contract which can fluctuate in value. I never see and immediate jump in my percentage gains for the day when I sell a contract, so I'm assuming that even if i get the money in my account, Robinhood only represents gains or losses on the contract as it fluctuates prior to expiration. In other words, if i make 500 premium from a contract, i will immediately have 500 dollars more in my account but I won't see it represented as gains until the contract expires worthless (let's assume that's what happens for this example). Is all this correct?\n\nA second question is, let's say i have hold a stock and sold call on it. If, prior to expiration the stock price rises above the strike i sold at, i basically won't see any gains represented as the stock rises past the strike, correct? The increasing intrinsic value of the call above the strike should basically negate any actual gains i make in the underlying stock, regardless of the time value left on the call, right?\n\nThanks for the help."

     "Hello , I started learning options yesterday and looked through the introductions for options and I am still kind of confused about intrinsic and extrinsic value. I understand that ITM options only have intrinsic value whereas OTM and ATM options have Extrinsic value only   \nBut I do not understand this scenario online \"Assume a trader buys a put option on XYZ stock. The stock is trading at $50, and the trader buys a put option with a strike price of $45 for $3. It expires in five months. If the stock falls below the put strike price of $45, then the option will have intrinsic value. For example, if the stock falls to $40, the option has $5 in intrinsic value. If there is still time until the option expires, that option may trade for $5.50, $6, or more, because there is still extrinsic value as well\"  Wait so what it is saying is that if i bought this OTM Put it will have intrinsic value if the stock falls to $40? but won't it contradict the statement whereby OTM options only have extrinsic value? Or is this because the OTM option became ITM? im so confused. And also , if bought an ITM call of the same XYZ stock $45 at eg $5 , and the stock price drops to $40 , does that mean by ITM call loses all its intrinsic value and we just lose the premium right? Pls pardon my noob qn"

     "A strategy I've been using some lately has been to look for stocks that pumped in AH on legit good news and has sky-high IV, then watch for a pullback that day (usually will happen in the morning) and sell puts then.  Pick a price that it shouldn't drop below.\n\nExample: ARVN had cancer drug news that sent their stock from $25-$30 to $70 over night.  It immediately pulled back to $60 and then at noon pulled back to $55, which is where I sold a -40p+25p spread that expired that week, for 0.68.  My logic was that even if the stock did nothing but pull back for the rest of the week it would probably still end above $40.  I ended up buying back the spread the next day for 0.10.  (Well, technically I only bought back the short put, the 25p was unsellable.)\n\nIf you're careful about the strikes of the puts you sell your only real risk should be tail risk... in the ARVN example if it had come out that the results had been falsified the stock could have dropped like a rock and I would have had to eat maximum loss.  That said, the reversal would have to happen fast, because I usually take my profit within a day or three.\n\nAn extra warning: don't do this if you don't know why the stock pumped, and you need to think the pump was for a good reason.  If it's just randomly pumping it could just be pumping and dumping, and if it's pumping for a bad reason it could dump once people figure that out."

     "The mistake here was doing it in TSLA.  I would recommend AMZN in the future.\n\nIn all seriousness, you have to understand that if you keep re-adjusting your strikes, as long it moves a lot in the future, you'll keep losing money.  Your trade is a pure implied vol vs. realized vol trade, since as long as future realized vol > implied vol (adjusted to your skew strangle), you'll lose.  So far, it's been realizing far more than the implied vol.Also, I'm not sure on your expiration but given you have 75k premium left, I assume these are mid dated options too (so not LEAPS but not weeklies either), so it'll take you a long time to collect this premium (for the vol to become theta), even if it stays range bound.\n\nAs someone who is bullish TSLA, I think TSLA is probably somewhat overvalued at this point, but the thing is even if it crashes back down, you still lose because you readjusted your strikes and now you'll lose on your put side instead of the call side.  Also the thing is you never known when it will come back because clearly it's in the middle of a massive short squeeze right now and can go up a ton more.  TSLA IV is also probably too high and cannot possibly maintain this level forever, but in that case, if you just want to sell vol, I recommend you open up like a condor with like 200 dollar wide ATM options for your base part of the condor or something rather than a strangle/straddle, and make sure to do it on leap options (2021), so you aren't as gamma exposed and so the next stock you invest it isn't ROPE."

So you need to find 100 shares.  Here's what you do:\n\nSell a 975 put. That'll put cash in your pocket. Use that to buy a 985 call. Either:\n\na) TSLA closes at around 900, so the calls don't matter, and your ITM put went way down in value, so you can buy it back with a bit of profit (whatever you didn't spend on the 985 call). Happy day.\n\nb) TSLA closes at 976, so the new Put is OTM, and you get assigned. You lose $100, big whoop.\n\nc) TSLA closes at 1000 or something. Both calls are ITM, you exercise one, get assigned the other, and you lose $500 on that but you keep the new put's premium, which oughta be decent and take the edge off."

     "Probably just hold it at this point and look for an opportunity to sell it if Tesla has a good/great day next week. \n\nMain issues though are:\n\n1) Too large of position size. If 1 trade going bad can have such a negative impact on your account, then that position is too large. With $25k, you probably shouldn't have more than $500 - $1000 at risk in any short-term position. \n\n2) You need to limit your losses either through stop losses or \"mental\" stop losses where you decide (before entering the position) what % loss you are willing to tolerate before cutting your losses. This depends on your personal risk tolerance as well as the risk/reward of the position. Also consider exit conditions if the position opens way down at market open. The point is, you need to focus first on avoiding massive losses at all costs. Otherwise, you will constantly give up your gains. \n\n3) Don't chase these losses. It happened, it's over, and it's time to move on. Make future trades based on their own merits and not to try to quickly recover losses from this trade. If you try to chase, you may get lucky. Most likely though you will suffer another big loss and go down this cycle until you inevitably blow up your entire account taking riskier and riskier trades. \n\nSo overall: smaller position sizes and focus on minimizing losses and exiting positions (even at loss) when your predetermined exit conditions are met. If you do these two things, you should rarely have losses significant enough to bother you."

Does that mean I receive $500 dollars in profit because the stock went up $5 dollars? Obviously minus fees and factoring in the premium I already paid.\n\nIf I\u2019m entering this position I would want to buy to open correct? Because if I do take the contract to expiration I want to buy the stock and without it I don\u2019t have Margin so i wouldn\u2019t be able to sell to close right?\n\nBut say i take it to the 180DTE mark because now I\u2019m still bullish and think the stock will rise to 15, does that mean I have to buy the 100 shares at strike price when the contract expires? Meaning I have to pay 500 dollars plus the premium I already paid?\n\nSorry if this is a repetitive question, my biggest concern is am I making the right call with buy to open and once in a contract can you just simply close a position and walk away with profit."

     ">The main reason being how you can take larger positions with the same capital at risk.\n\nYes, this is true. However, it also means that your gains are capped. When you're long calls or puts, you have a significantly higher upside potential vs. selling that potential via deeper call or put spread to subsidize the entry debit. However, the better approach will vary depending on the volatility skew, your view, and your risk/reward goals.\n\nIn your ARKK scenario, you're not exactly comparing the same trades. Buying the 39 put at 4.20 is a much more aggressive trade because you'd need it to go down to 34.80 to break even. It would have to go down to 30.30 to reach the 107% potential the spread trade has. However, ARKK's IV is so high for that term (48%) that there's \\~14% chance that it will close below 30.30.\n\nThe spread, on the other hand, is way less aggressive as you're buying the 42 and selling the 39 for 1.45. It breaks even once you hit 40.55 with the potential for as much as a 1.55 gain at or below 39 for a capped 107% gain.\n\nIf you're moderately bearish and expecting a 0 to -1 vol move in the underlying (31.18-45.01), the spread trade has a much better return profile at an average of 38% for the model. The naked put would be -50%.\n\nHowever, if you're very bearish and expecting a -0.5 to -2 vol move in the underlying (21.59-37.46), the naked put would average 90% while the spread would cap at 107%. The big difference is that the long put trade would produce a gain 315% if ARKK closes at 21.59.\n\nI'm not saying you should have a preference for single-leg or spreads or whatever. It's more that options are awesome because of how well they enable you to finely tune your strategy to express a really precise view. That's also why it's very useful to have tools that do all the heavy lifting to compare which trades are best for a given view as it really depends on the underlying probabilities and option pricing at any given time.\n\nJust remember that the expected return on any given option is 0. In other words, the fair price of an option is calculated to break even. That's why market makers are willing to simultaneously buy or sell a given option for a slight (or sometimes not-so-slight) edge in the bid/ask spread. This means that you need to be not just correct about the direction, magnitude, and timing, but you also need to be *more* correct than the market."

     "One of the main differences between the two is the curve of the risk graph.  If ARKK were drop to $39 in a week, the 39 put would be up roughly $170 whereas the spread would be profiting around $105.  Then from there, the 39 put would eventually decay to zero and expire worthless by September and the spread get max profit is ARKK is at 39 or less.  This was calculated as one 39 put for 4.10 vs three 42/39 spreads at 1.28 each for a total of 3.84.  I tried to make the capital as close as possible."

     "It just depends what risk you want to have on. By doing the put instead of the equivalent value in put spreads, you get roughly 8 more deltas, .012 more gamma, .083 more vega and pay .011 more theta. \n\nSo, just analyze the position. If the stock moves to $39 in the next month, the ROI on the put is likely much better. At that point, the put will have a 40ish delta and the spread will have something like a 10 delta. Your pnl from delta and gamma will be greater with the put than the spread. On the other hand if the stock grinds down over the next 6 months and hits $38 in late August, those puts probably get crushed by theta and trade not far from intrinsic. At that point, if they\u2019re trading for something like $1.20, the spread will be trading for not much less than that and so the ROI on the spread will be greater. \n\nPoint being, it depends what risk you want on and that depends what you forecast the stock doing. Outright calls and puts benefit from quicker moves and vol increases, and lose when volatility dies and theta crushes them. It\u2019s easier to just look at the actual greeks of each trade and decide what is better depending on your forecasts."

     "When comparing a long put and a put vertical where both positions are short the same put, on an expiration basis, the equivalence price is the short strike less the premium received for it.  Above that price, the spread outperforms.  Below that price, the long put outperforms.  Therefore, the desirability of one versus the other depends on the performance of the underlying.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, long the XYZ $100p for $5 versus the vertical that is long the XYZ $100p for $5 and short the $95p for $3 (net cost $2).  At $92 ($95 - $3), the standalone long put is worth $8 for a gain of $3 whereas the spread has achieved its maximum gain of $3 ($5 spread with a cost of $2).  So above $92, the spread outperforms.  Below $92, the long put outperforms.\r  \n\r  \nBefore expiration, the P&L depends on what the price of the underlying, IV, and theta decay.  But it's still the same idea.  Since both positions are long the same option, which one outperforms is determined by what the $95 put does.  If it's worth less than the $3 credit received (IV change and/or theta decay), the spread outperforms.  If it's worth more than $3, the standalone long put outperforms.  This is easier to visualize if you have an option program that can graph multi-legged positions before expiration.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then there's the issue of less cash at risk with the spread that you mentioned."

Shares up nearly $28, or 6% to $498 this afternoon following headlines regarding China deliveries (and CEO dance moves), with total volume closing in on 1M contracts and calls leading puts 5:3. 52% of today's volume is in weeklys that expire in two days, including 41K 500 strike calls which have traded from $3 to $9, avg $5.46. Largest trade is in the longer dated Jan21 term, where 1280 Jan21 380 puts traded for $39.50 tied to a delta hedge of 28K shares at $489. This $5M block of premium may close part of the 335/380 put spread that traded last week 4000x for $16.50 vs $429 stock. Notably, today's all-time high price for TSLA comes with unprecedented levels of bullish sentiment in the options, in the form of inverted put/call skewness. Currently 25 delta call ivol at the 30day term is above that of 25delta puts for only the second time since options were listed in 2015"

It's got a unique vol surface/skew that is very different than a lot of other equities (ex biotech)\n2. There is an abnormal amount of option volume relative to share volume, which is way different than the option volume: share volume of other stocks\n\nI believe TSLA is the hardest equity to trade in terms of being a pure options vol trader (ex delta).\n\nIf you can trade TSLA in terms of vol, I believe you can trade almost any single stock well except for maybe biotechs, corporate action stocks since that's another category.  I'm just talking about vol here, not like you are just bullish TSLA and bought a ton of OTM calls."

     "Hi all- put/call skew is also the 'smile' or smirk discussed in options pricing- for most stocks, etfs, and indexes the out of the money puts trade at higher implied vol than out of the money calls to reflect the (actual or expected) higher risk of things crashing down than up.  Any consistent way to quantify it works- we use a 25delta put IV minus the 25delta call IV- that is what the green line shows on the image. So you can see that most of the past year in Tesla options the 25d put was about 8 points above the 25d call and when that became negative (put below call) it was very unusual! In this situation the calls are cheaper (in volatility terms and possibly price) than the puts and it means you can collar (hedge) the stock at a historically cheap cost.  Notably- this trade just printed today 1/9,  **5000 TSLA Aug20 300 Puts $12.173** (*FT Theo=11.31*) \u00a0Above Ask!\u00a0 \\[MULTI\\] 10:45:12 **IV=58.2%** PHLX 63 x $11.35 - $11.75 x 83 PHLX \u00a0ISO - OPENING\u00a0 \u00a052WeekHigh\u00a0 Vega=$377k **TSLA=489.32** (Premium=$6.09m)  - suggesting someone might be look for Tsla to reverse course for at least a while."

From there, one of three things can happen between now and 16 Jul 21.\\n\\n1. TSLA stock keeps going ballistic and goes through the strike price. Stock gets called away. In which case, I get to keep $10,100 (premium on call) + $95,000 (100 shares at $950). So a total profit of $45,100 ($60,000 cost and $95,000 + $10,100 profit).\\n2. TSLA stock tanks massively in which case, i still hold the shares and take the loss on those, but collect the premium of $10,100 lowering my costs basis to $49,900.\\n3. TSLA stock does nothing, scenario 2 above as the options expire and i still get to realize more profit due to lower cost basis.\\n\\nIs my thinking correct here.

Has anyone experimented with this? or a 3x fund it\u2019s respective inverse.\n\nWouldn't work, don't waste your time. You can do a much better job of inversing (or leveraging) yourself just with options. A short IC is inversed by a long IC, for example. But of course holding both at the same strikes would net to zero, or would be equivalent to a box spread.\n\nYou never want to be \"truly neutral\" to all risks. If that's the goal, invest $0, easy-peasy. If you are trying to be specifically delta neutral, a short IC is already delta neutralish. It's good enough. If you want to neutralize more delta, you can pair a positive delta theta/vega play, like a leveraged short put, with shorting delta-weighted shares and rebalancing daily.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ulvsck/theta_without_delta_intro_to_vol_trading/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/v67zay/a_guide_to_csps/\n\n> On more volatile stocks such as TSLA I was considering **selling debit put spreads** or iron condors with premium collection around 1:3 the width of my spread.\n\nYou can't *sell* a *debit spread*. If you sell to open a spread, that is a credit spread, by definition.\n\nDelta-neutralish structures like ICs shouldn't be used on stocks with high volatility, like TSLA. Exploit the high volatility, don't be victimized by it. You want to sell overpriced IV and cover with underpriced realized volatility, keeping the difference.\n\n> I would look to take money off the table at 30-50% max profit. If I was to reach 40% I may would set a stop loss for 30-35% max profit and see if I could approach the 50% mark.\n\nYou can't one-size-fits-all profit targets across disparate structures. What's optimal for an IC may not be optimal for a credit spread. For example, a 50% **net** of max profit target for an IC can mean that one of the wings has lost all of it's credit, while the other is paying max. You don't want to get that deep into testing one wing or the other, so a more middling profit target, like 25% of max, lets you exit when the underlying price is closer to the midpoint and no wing is tested.\n\nAlso, stop-losses only work on the most liquid and high volume trades. If your IC is only traded half a dozen times a day, there isn't enough price discovery for stop losses to be effective.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/stop_loss/"

You also don't want to exercise when there is still time value on the options since it is better to sell the call option and buy the stock at current price.  But if you want to hold until expiration and want to have positive theta, you can turn it into a butterfly with a bullish bias.  One example is to sell two 16 June 2023 280 Call for 10.00 and buy one 16 June 2023 300 Call for 7.00 for a credit of 14.00.  This will have a positive theta and you can hold until expiration without having theta risk. You will however still be exposed to delta as this trade has a positive delta so you will lose money if TSLA retraces from the recent highs but that is also the case with your original trade (original trade even has more delta risk).  You can play around with the short strikes based on where you think TSLA will by by June 2023."

     "Importance of being right about market direction when trading options\n\nI trade stocks consistently for many years based on a mix of fundamental & technical analysis. But when I turned to options I became a loser again\u2026 I tell you my reasons I suspect this is happening: The risk reward ratio for options is not good as stocks. A vertical, for example, is 1, so I have to be right more than 50% of the time, like 70%, in order to make money, which is impossible to me (and probably everyone to do it consistently). So I started trading OTM butterflies, and the RRR is decent, but I have to be extremely right about market direction, which is not easy too. If I buy/sell ATM butterflies the reward is low and OTM it is hard to get the direction. So I started going long ATM Straddles when I guess IV is low, but the premiums are not cheap, and again I need prices to move well in my favor. At this point I think the options business is more like pure mathematics and game theory. I feel like market forecast doesn\u2019t work for options and the math must prevail, like buying OTM butterflies (maybe broken wings to get some theta if the price don\u2019t move), above and below the underlying and pay to see, like a poker hand. I know my thought process is probably very confused and I appreciate if someone can tell me a new line of thinking. Thank you, Yuri"

     "Hi,\n\nMy second post here! You can read my first post at below link (not mandatory lol)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/y5zei2/comment/isr6028/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/y5zei2/comment/isr6028/?context=3)\n\nIn case you read my first post, here are the updates for the positions. my ORCL/AMZN trade expired ITM, and SQ/COST expired OTM!\n\nAnyways, been reading about lots of options and wanted to give some updates and ask lots of questions here.\n\n1. I ordered \"Options Volatility and Pricing\" by Nathenberg. Its at parents place, so I am going to start reading it from January 2023. Question is: Is that enough to understand everything about options and most importantly will it teach how to trade volatility. I been reading a lot on volatility, but I am still not sure what to look for (IV, IV Rank, IV Percentile) and how much is \"high IV\" and how much is \"low IV\". Also read about \"Volatility Smile\" and volatility across different strikes and different expiration dates. I understand the concepts but I am lost on how to use them in a structured way. I am part of few discord groups (Free communities) and the answers are very general and vague like \"You get it with experience\", \"Keep studying\", \"Stick with stocks\"...\n2. For long term investing, I have a solid stock portfolio, except its not solid in 2022 lol.. but pays dividends and they are blue chip companies, so they will go back up within 30 years. No problem.\n3. I am interested in options trading (both day and swing trading). Additionally, last 2 years I have been developing an open-source algo framework (currently connects only to TD and IB). Link is below for anyone who wants to contribute/discuss. Still its work in progress! For day trading I want to use my algo and automate the trades.  \n[https://github.com/brahma-investment-group/big-algo-framework/tree/ib\\_insync\\_final](https://github.com/brahma-investment-group/big-algo-framework/tree/ib_insync_final)\n4. For swing trading, I have about 5K, and planning to do spreads (vertical, diagonal, calendar) and iron condors -- 45 to 60 DTE, Credit only. I read some posts here which suggested these. But again, I dont know when to use when and under what conditions.\n5. For day trading, I am assuming that doing spreads and iron condors would be a kill. My overall strategy for day trading would be momentum directional. I actually wrote a algo (using the above algo framework) to buy single PUTS/CALLS -- 1 OTM with minimum 2 DTE (So on fridays it would literally buy next weeks options). Again, for the algo I picked few stocks and indices (SPY/QQQ), but it wasnt taking into account IV or any greeks. Of course, I won some and lost some, but there isnt any consistency\n\nLooking forward for any suggestions or to answer questions and have discussions!"

     "Any non-obvious pitfalls to selling ITM spreads?\n\nFor example, I've noticed that I can take a stock with an established uptrend, and sell an ITM put spread pretty close to the price (so not ATM but just one or two strikes away), and get a risk:reward ratio better than 1:1. This works for expirations that are months away, so I have months for the trend to continue past my spread's strikes.\n\nIt seems like a pretty simple trend trade with the benefit of defined risk, and the downsides of limited reward and potentially having to wait weeks or months to take profits.\n\nAnything I'm missing?"

Across 10 months (feb-nov) the $1000 weekly gains would result in gains of $20,000, and the loss weeks would result in a losses of $20,000, but these would be subject to wash sale and cannot offset the gains (yet). \n\nMy understanding is as of TODAY, all the $10k january losses + the $20k losses accrued through the year are wash sale disallowed: therefore short-term taxes as of this moment would be owed on $20k. \n\nHowever if all positions were closed out today and not touched again until on or after Jan 1st, then ALL losses this year will become REALIZED: the result is $20k gains - ($20k losses from rest of year) - ($10k january loss) for a net short-term capital loss of $10k, realized and claimable for the tax year 2022.\n\n\nIs that understanding correct?"
