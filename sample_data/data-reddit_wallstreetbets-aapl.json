Sears, not knowing what the thing was, sold it in its home appliance department along with the Kenmore vacuum cleaners, blenders, Little Mac hamburger cookers, and ironing boards.  The sales people had no training and not a clue how it worked. They could not demo them.  So they sat there with lovely cardboard signage turned off.\n\nBushnell would have been dumb to support a competitor. Atari was bought by Waner Communications in 1976. They sold it to Jack Tramiel of Commodore fame in 1984. \n\nPeople look at personal computers as something that has always been around and has clear value. Not so at all. In the beginning you could not give them away. No one had a clue why you would want one. Hell the handheld calculator had just come out and people struggled adopting it.  The learning curve was steep; the software buggy.  The memory was so small you couldn't do much.  Then came the Visicalc spreadsheet. The first \"killer app\".  It allowed middle management to do REAL work every day and being middle management could sign off on the expense - which was SUBSTANTIAL for a real computer, keyboard, printer, terminal (or monitor) and floppy disk drives."

[Source](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp#citation-17)  You can read more about dark pools more generally there.  They are not illegal, even though dark sounds scary, they are a normal part of daily market function.  Many times, its just pensions or buy side institutions looking to not disturb the markets.  \n\nOn this day..  AAPL had:\n\nAAPL Off Exchange & Dark Pool Summary\r  \nToday's Off Exchange & Dark Pool volume is 30,672,965, which is 46.93% of today's total volume.\r  \nToday's Lit volume is 34,686,800, which is 53.07%.\r  \nOver the past 30 days, the average Off Exchange & Dark Pool volume has been 42.84%.\r  \nThe average Lit volume has been 57.16%. [Source](https://chartexchange.com/symbol/nasdaq-aapl/exchange-volume/)\n\nIt was a slightly higher day in off exchange / dark pool volume, relative to the average daily volume.  This particular trade accounted for \\~13% of daily volume.  Its large.  But it is not uncommon.  \n\nTLDR  Take this with a grain of salt amongst all the other things you take into account when making a trade.  Or not, just smash the call button on your personal gambling device. \n\n....yes there are controversies surrounding off exchange trading on \"unlit\" markets.  I encourage you to educate yourself.  Find others that share your beliefs and organize.  Its not to hard to find the folks addressing these issues if thats what you are into."

     "Up and down cycles are inevitable, just as Issac Newton once said, \"What goes up must come down\". Now, I don't mean that stocks are like gravity where it'll plummet back down to earth or to the core. But, stocks will inevitably come down, because people will want to pocket profits and reallocate assets as wise investors should (definitely doesn't extend to many of us here). That being said, for Aapl here's a list of bearish news I could list right now:\n\n* **Recession fears:** EU nations (ie: Germany) and some other wealthier nation(s) are entering a technical recession (New Zealand). Thereby, demand for discretionary goods (iphones/macs/ipads) traditionally will go down. As lending/credit will inevitably tighten, government bailouts or supports can only go so far before they can't lend any further (Not sure about this argument tho...)\n* **Sales Decline:** Certain segment of Apple products have been on the decline for the past few quarters, showing potential slowdown and worsening sales overall in the future\n* **Inflation**, while people are pointing out that inflation is declining people have to remember, we are talking about 4% inflation rate on top of a 8%+ inflation rate last year during the month of May alone. Wages have not caught up with it, and this discrepancy seems to be only widening. Yes, were not having a wage death spiral like the 70's, but we're also seeing a bigger gap in wealth. People nowadays are now more selective in their spending, giving a feedback loop to potential increase of recession. As spending slows so will profits and revenues decline for companies across all discretionary markets (Apple falls into this).\n* **Innovation**, Apple honestly, haven't really brought out any revolutionary products nor any new product(s) that can shake the whole market. Yes, they recently brought out that vision pro thing. But, at $3,500 how many people could really afford it just to \"try it out\"? Furthermore, we've seen how META, MSFT, Google all have given their shot at this eyewear market. Realistically none of them have had much success, yes maybe Apple could actually change it. But, unlikely just cause of the rich history of failures with this attempt of a product. I remember back in the 2000's seeing a teacher showing us similar 1990's version of these visual digital eyewear that was to simulate \"a new world\". Doesn't work well and haven't even after 3 decades... It'll probably take 3-4 generations before it could take off, which means cash burn. Remember Meta was confident they could pull it off, but now they're clawing back on their spending on Metaverse, that's one of the main driver in why META rebounded.\n* **Shareholders**, one of the least thought rationale why stocks decline. When a company such as Apple who have one of the largest or if not is the largest company in the world, shareholders will demand more and more out of it. This leads Aapl to one day face the same dilemma that oil companies now face. Oil companies in order to retain investors, have to return 50%+ on average of their gains back to their investors in the form of stock buybacks/dividends. While, there are a lot of reasons that differentiate between Aapl & oil companies in terms of industry demands (oil is a capital intensive market). It also acts as a good reminder that some of these oil titans of the 50-80's ended up having to return more and more over time to their shareholders in order to retain investors capital. These dividends/stock buybacks were things that Steven Jobs didn't really like overall, because he thought capital could be better/efficiently used by the company themselves. But, now Apple has gone down this road and gave out dividends and have increased their stock buybacks. When shareholders gets used to this, they won't take it kindly if Apple suddenly decreases it when it runs into a recession etc. So stock prices will come down significantly once Apple starts or slowdown stock repurchases/dividends.\n   * Look at Disney for example, yes Disney too have a lot of other reasons that Apple doesn't share commonality of why their stock prices declined from the heights of the pandemic. But, one of the things I see common when reading articles and opinions by investors is the lack of dividends or stock repurchases. Hedge funds/fund managers who want safe and stable returns looks to purchase these cash cow companies because they give a good or relatively fair return in the form of dividends/stock buy backs. Once, Disney went down this road of no longer giving dividends. They started to waver after the height of the pandemic and with more and more disappointing earnings report compounding it. Shareholders patience have only so much before they decide to drop the stock, that once gave dividends or stock buy backs. It's the fallacy of *\"once given, it's hard to go back\"*.\n\nOverall, these are my rationale why Apple could come down in the future, now these are just my opinions and shouldn't be used for any financial decisions. Also these are just the cons, I haven't listed any pros or any reasons why Apple could keep going up. There's both sides of the coins and honestly **Apple is a strong company**. I don't expect it to suddenly drop 20% in the span of a month. If that were to happen it'd have to be a recession on the scale of the GFC of 2008 or the great depression. But, just keep your toes on point and be mindful when making an investment/purchase. Do research and DD and hopefully it works out in the end.\n\n**TLDR:** Why I think a decline in Apple stock prices is cause of the following: Overbought, recession fears, inflation, sales decline in certain segments of apple products, lack of innovations that can be used/afforded by a lot of consumers, and shareholders demand. Overall, Apple is a strong company, but must be wary of this overly positive market when there's a lot of downside risk to it."

This keeps people interested in the brand and drives up sales. Additionally, Apple has a strong financial position with lots of cash on hand to invest in new initiatives or weather any storms that come its way. Finally, consumer confidence in the company remains high despite some recent controversies, meaning people are still willing to buy its products."

Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apples returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isnt flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. \\n\\nAs the worlds leading consumer products and technology company, Apples earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple? \\n\\nHeres what analysts think:\\n\\n* Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/)\\n\\n* Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv\\n\\nRevenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

This could get a freak flood  from crap banks and unbanked into iphone as a bank. Making overnight, Apple one of the biggest most integrated and well accepted fintech payments processor.\n\nthat is some heavy stuff looking long from here, not to be overhype, but it could be a 2-7yr multiX price vs share with forward splits expected, potential spinoff and massive uptick in cash volume plus user/fee base. It's crazy enough for a movie plot.\n\nIRL, I use android because I don't like having a phone master i have to pay for my own shit. Trade wise, fk it, near term volatility is profit, and obvious growth long is easy value.\n\n\\*\\*edit, derped out and forgot extended context\n\nGoldman Sachs is doing the banking for Apple, Goldman just announced step back from retail/consumer banking. It is almost conspiracy good timing for the perfect bridge to shadow bank it. Which could lead to customer and holdings increase beyond the massive volume and fees implied on all sides.\n\nInteresting times. \\*\\*endedit \n\nJust my 2 crayons."

  "Text": "b\"Hello everyone! I have been a lurker on the sub for a few months and want to post about a small position I am taking and I am sure many others are. Tech companies like META and MSFT beat earnings and their stock prices spiked after. I see an opportunity with MSFT earnings coming out first, them beating earnings, and their stock price blowing up, followed by the same thing happening with META a day later. I feel like the market should've priced this in because they are in the same industry, but it still happened so I feel AAPL has a chance to do the same. \\n\\nHere's my position and reasoning. I bought 10 call contracts with a strike of $190 expiring 5/5. The IV is 38.18% and my breakeven is $190.04. I feel if AAPL beats earnings the same way its competitors did, it will see a similar jump in share price. Yes, Q1 revenue was down 5% compared to the previous year while MSFT was up 11% over the same period of time. I feel this provides more upside potential for AAPL if they beat earnings.\\n\\nI\"",

I would watch in the short term if it hits 153 your puts are not in line with the trend, 136 and your still on line for some nice tendies. That strike date is too short tbh and I will say theta may eat your ass, but I like weeklys so I know your risk profile.  I'm starting to see a trend where people are right but the timeline doesn't allow for the full maximization of pulling tendies.  God speed and have a nice mid life crisis explaining to the wife you yoloed 100k on some chinese foxxconn employees not trying to kill themselves and protesting instead, oh and what if china opens up like the mkt is pricing in?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said with that delta and your timeframe you can grab 170% profits on your breakeven of 141 and upside to 136 in the short term is \\~210% honestly puts suck."

     "AAPL is holding because of many reasons. Here are some random ones I can think of:\n\n1. Their physical goods and raw materials literally have intrinsic value (like gold etc). When war broke out, ppl in affected countries bought apple products hoping to resell later in a bid to retain their falling currency value. Countries less affected by world economy are still consuming apple products.\n\n2. Their revenue is diversified across hardware, software and services. (Unlike Meta and Google that are heavily reliant on only ad revenue as their main income source).\n\n3. They don\u2019t spend money recklessly, or yolo into something just because hype (eg. Metaverse), but focus on their fundamentals in delivering quality products.\n\n4. As a result are actually profitable unlike the other big tech. Look at their quarterly reports, still posting profits despite interest rates hike and supply issues, showing resilience year after year.\n\n5. Apple has resources to buyback heavily if it falls more, heck, institutions and investors will probably buy them back before letting it fall further.\n\nWait all you want but AAPL will never fall to $60. I\u2019m willing to bet with you if it falls to $60, mods can ban my account."

     "more bearish stuff, they have high forex exposure and strong dollar will fuck them over. Last ER they blames exchange rate, they can do the same again. It\u2019s definitely not the apple product price cuts and sales they are doing in China that\u2019s hurting margins. the average Chinese citizen needs no incentive and is flocking to buy an inferior spec phone in comparison to the Chinese phones with dual fucking chips is what apple is trying to convince US share holders. Heck they haven\u2019t even provided guidance since covid yet people still view it as a \u201csafe\u201d company. The only reason the stock hadn\u2019t collapse is share buy backs which is also why EPS is still strong because there\u2019s less shares on the market\u2026. Apple is a ticking time bomb the way they are burning their cash reserves to prop up stock price. If they run out of cash it dooms the company, if they stop buy backs it\u2019ll doom the share price. One is short term demolition but survival at the end the other is permanent demolition."

Unlike the three stocks I mentioned above, Apple actually has positive earnings on a yearly basis.

     "Thank you for the write up. It\u2019s great. \n\nHere is something I wrote previously: \n\nSome headlines recently mentioned that Apple has told suppliers to prepare for higher iPhone 14 pro sales volume. Great. It seems like a fantastic product with lots of updates that make it a great value. On top of that, they didn\u2019t increase the prices on any of the models which shocked most people. And it should, because it is a certainty that the phone is now more expensive to produce and deliver into peoples hands than it was a year ago. Honestly, it\u2019s a great move by Apple. The headline of \u201cFancy phone company increases prices because of inflation\u201d would not have gone over well. They are going to eat the short term hit to profitability for long-term goodwill. It\u2019s a genius, long-term oriented strategy. Plus they probably had no choice if they wanted to maintain revenue numbers.\n\nBut what about profits? Apple is great at the supply chain, cost structure, and all of that stuff. But there is no way they can offset higher chip prices and material costs. \n\nSo what did they do to help improve the profitability of the iPhone business segment? They slapped new packaging on the previous years lower end iPhone offerings and removed the worst selling low end model. Almost nothing has changed on the lower end models. According to Statista, the lower end model accounted for a majority of iPhone sales as recently as 2021. (https://www.statista.com/statistics/804398/us-iphone-sales-by-model/) There is probably better data out there, but the point is that the sales of the low end iPhone are really important. If they just slapped new packaging on the phone, why would anyone buy it? \n\nI don\u2019t know. But I do know that it makes the higher end iPhone a much better deal. And this is holding true: \u201cApple expects 85% of early adopters to opt for a pro model\u201d https://9to5mac.com/2022/09/09/iphone-14-sales/ and https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/19/apple-supplier-shifts-production-to-make-more-iphone-14-pro-models\n\nHow could 85% of early adopters opting for a pro model be a good thing if more than 50% of iPhone sales should come from the lower end iPhone? I\u2019m no math magician, but something seems off there.   I\u2019m sure people are talking about this, but I\u2019ve personally stopped watching/listening to most news sources. \n\nAll in all, Apple has a large and complex business, there are certainly other levers they are pulling to increase profitability. But it seems a near certainty to me that profitability is going to continue to decline while revenue may also decrease. I really don\u2019t know, but I would certainly gamble on the stock going down via November 120 puts. Timing is everything though. Apple going down should bring down the stock market as well even if most stocks are doing well."

Apple people look at the devices I like as if they were some insane foreign gear-driven wrong-alphabet typewriter and always have."

     "I'd adjust all the numbers to account for the piles of cash you'd also be buying, kind of cash-back rebate on your $2.3T purchase. Too lazy to look at balance sheet to subtract assets from liabilities.. but I'm pretty sure it's positive. Plus, isn't it possible they borrowed a fuck ton of money at low rates and can now just themselves buy treasury bills to make money off of the borrowed money?\n\nOn the scale of things, won't matter much to your argument. The real wiggle room is in how far into the future you want to value their growth and prospects.\n\nThey have some incredible products and even more incredibly stupid users. I mean.. you can't even add a fucking memory card to their phones, ipads, etc... instead you get reamed to pay more. But.. wow.. there's a \"virtual island\" or whatever. And people are all happy about the fact they offer the higher memory versions, get excited about new colors and increasingly worthless features, etc, etc. Hard to put a number on holding a massively loyal fanbase that throws money at you happily.\n\nBut, I agree, I think they're going to take a tumble. Not because investors want to park their money elsewhere (there will always be an appetite for risk, and AAPL represents the best of value AND growth combined).. but because I think consumers will slow their discretionary spending a lot, and that's what the market is going to care about.\n\nI have March $110P."

     "Lmao people who bash VR (note not AR) as a bad investment are so short sighted. As someone using it everyday it\u2019s like reading comments about the internet in 1992 where the news segments are laughing at notion the infant WWW would result in anything significant. \n\nIf you know someone with a meta quest go ask to play thrill of the fight (a $10 game) and experience getting your fucking ass kicked in a single 3 round fight in less than 10 minutes. You will be dripping with sweat throwing haymakers in an immersive simulated boxing match, and the best part is it\u2019s insanely FUN. I\u2019ve lost 20 pounds literally because of a video game lmao, with 0 changes to my diet. \n\nEvery person I have shown my VR headset two are amazed by it. Once the triple AAA companies start making games it will the future vr will play a major role in video games. It\u2019s is the ultimate immersive \n experience for games. \n\nAnd video games are only a fraction of the potential revenue streams. In the next 10 years the NFL and NBA will be selling monthly subscription options to watch games in VR from a court side seats perspective. The nfl I promise you, will put cameras on qb helmets to give you in the moment feel of a game from the qbs perspective. VR has so many potential options for revenue, sports and video games are just the obvious start.\n\nTLDR you are being a dumb dumb if you think VR is a fad. It\u2019s new, it\u2019s not perfect, but holy shit go use one and you will understand. It\u2019s like the first time you used an iPhone and got that \u201cyeah\u2026 this is the future\u201d feeling. I promise you, two of the 7 biggest companies in the world are not investing billions in the space without the due diligence, and more importantly foresight, to see where VR is 5 to 10 years from now. It has the potential to be their flagship product."

     "In the financial world what you just posted is actually illegal according to both SEC and NASAA rules. \n\nThe reason being is because it gives the illusion of success. \n\nHowever, we must list all performance not in the last year and all winners and losers, net gains, and for a specific time frame. \n\nThe entirety of the stock market has traded flat for the first 6 months of the year barring 6-8 high moving stocks that make up all growth across all sectors and markets. These stocks now hold weight of some 30-40% in all of the indexs. The whole point of an index is for it be equal weight so that if apple posts a missed revenue and weak guidance and drops 30% that it doesn't tank growth for the next 3 years on your index fund investments. \n\nAlmost every other stock in the market including real money makers that have solid balance sheets and recession proof products or services are trading 40% lower than they were a year ago. \n\nSo there are two big points to make here. \n\n1. You cherry picked data and used recent massive run ups in the last 3-4 weeks as your primary data source to say we are going to continue to go up. Which is stupid but also would be illegal if you were in finance. \n\n2. It's ironic that you don't realize the statement you just made is the perfect illustration as to why we will crash a good 20-30% and it's going to be almost entirely the stocks you just mentioned. \n\nNvidia is trading at 200 times its earnings. In a normal market with the absolute highest potential growth a PE ratio should never exceed 80-90. 80 quarters is 20 years. That's fucking insane. A normal PE ratio for a good growth company and solid balance sheet is normally 24. \n\nTesla at 64\nMicrosoft at 36\nApple at 30\nGoogle at 28 \n\n\nSo you can see how Google, apple and Microsoft are way closer to that normal PE ratio and have huge fortresses of a balance sheet. If they take a haircut of 10% each they'll be at market value. Because those 3 have a weight of close to 15% of the spy, the spy will take a haircut to about 385. When Tesla and Nvidia come back to earth, that's what you're gonna see spy hit 350s. This all assumes the rest of the market stays flat. Which of course it won't. \n\n\nWe are in the fomo greed cycle at the very end before a big hit. Stay cash and get ready to play the ups and downs for the next year."

Add in the chip shortages that have been going on and how apple hasn't really been in the forefront of the tech industry since Steve Jobs passing, and quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if the company does crash in the coming 1-3 years."

     "I\u2019ve been bag-holding AAPL for over 10 years. There have been quarters with disappointing iPhone sales before (the iPhone 6s year, for example), but sooner or later Apple always rebounds because it tends to be quick at identifying issues and often turns them into strengths. \n\nThe growth of iPhone sales has decreased for a while now, everyone knows smartphones are a mature product now and people tend to use them longer. That\u2019s why Apple created the $1000 phone category in the first place. They\u2019ve also diversified a lot, with services still growing strong, and the Mac being more appealing than ever due to the switch to Apple silicon. Apple also has fantastic production efficiency, does a lot in-house, has special privileges with its manufacturers (for example, Foxconn making sure that Apple products are assembled on time even when everything else is on hold), and is actively working on reducing its reliance on China for manufacturing. The fact that they plan a huge stock buyback is also a good sign of its health, in my opinion.\n\nYes, a couple of bad quarters could be bad for the company. And yes, it\u2019s still very reliant on iPhone sales. Generally, I expect their growth to slow in the future, possibly turning into a value stock over the next 5\u201310 years. But I don\u2019t think Apple has any more risks than Google, and the argument \u201cit\u2019s not the same price it was in 2019\u201d doesn\u2019t really convince me.\n\nIf you want to play some short-term bets against Apple be my guest, but I\u2019m sleeping very well with my shares (admittedly, I\u2019ve sold a lot this year and only have 700 left)."

The more I read about apple the more the company seems like it is effortlessly ahead of its competitors. Their ability to poach other markets is unique. Surveys suggest the apple car is even more popular than Teslas. Simultaneously have exceeded a 50% share of the mobile phone market. Their watchful waiting in the electric car market, in my opinion, is going to pay off massively. I do not necessarily agree ethically with this company or other monopolies like it, however, the relative stability of the investment, even though it wont return 280% in a year, I believe it can be even more attractive than punts and other gambling activities, especially when you combine it with other consequential trades like a $TSLA short. I still gamble on meme stocks however I have learnt 10-20% is ok, but not 100% and I certainly think a lot of money can be saved in the process.\\n\\nDisclaimer; this is my opinion and p'",

There is NOTHING they dont have their hands in.  They are their own bank for fuck sake. The long term gain tax will be very nice\n However I do have one exception. It's a stock I bought about the same time as Apple originally.\nMVIS some of my apple shares went to this. A decade of waiting and riding this ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 15 CENTS is about to pay off huge. 10x AINT NOTHIN when this one hits. I've bought a crap load more along the way.

This is why I think if there is a rally, it won\u2019t make it to the top VTL on your chart. It might make it half way there, and this will look like a wick on the weekly chart.\n\nHead and shoulders can be measured to predict the long term move for swing trading. Duplicate the existing parallel channel, take the duplicated parallel channel\u2019s top VTL and put it on top of the existing parallel channel\u2019s bottom VTL. Whatever the duplicated parallel channel\u2019s bottom VTL is, is the next price target.

Well apparently chinese people are dying to buy iphones. They are literally killing each other to get an iphone. \\n\\nBut wait. Isnt the asian market known to always want the best product configuration available for the cheapest price? I.e their iphones have dual sim slot, their androids have the fastest processors.

Their core business is still the iphone, their next line up iphone 14 will have the old. A15 chip thats already in the iPhone 13. \\nTheir new macbook air base model 256gb has a 30-40% slower ssd than the last generation but with a rougly 30% price spike.

     "Thanks for sharing, agree with some points but definitely disagree with your idea of watching Bloomberg and CNBC all day. They are rarely on the side of retails best interest and are puppets to the controlling powers to play a fear game on retail investors and traders to get in and out of their positions at the worst of times. \n\nI'm sure you reflect back and wish you took the advice I'm about to give everyone on here.\n\nInvest, put your money in a basket of stocks/etf's all in and never look back, only down the road after 10 plus years. People who truly invest in stocks get rewarded.\n\nEvery seasoned investor/trader can tell you a story how they had a plethora of stocks at very low prices but decided to sell after holding for small gains either because of fear or felt like they needed to cash in some meesley gains. \n\nHow many of you at one time have owned shares of Tesla, apple, Kla, ASML, enphase, applied materials, Facebook, google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel, amd, nvda at infintile stages in their stock price lives and say to yourself \"only if I would have held for 10 years\"\n\nPeople who invest in America long term get rewarded, more times then not \n\nThat is the best advice you will ever get .\n\nOk now the funny people can start now with typical wsb sayings....let's here it, the big money controllers are feasting on you...yes just like the casino."

     "I just wrote a detailed analysis on the behavior of some of you regards of what you consider a \"short squeeze\" of another famous symbol this week that I did the research on.\n\nReality is, what you regards think is a short squeeze, is likely just a buying rally. Yes shorters will have to close their positions when the stock rallies 50-100-200% but then it's only up because some regard bought it at that high premium. When the shorts are closed, a continued rally only means a bag holder passing the bag.\n\nGL yall squeezing these evil wallstreets. In reality yall just squeezing each other :)\n\nThe post got banned because it's literally my first post and I have offended some admin's lack of reading skills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Short interest gets reported biweekly. Whatever it is the short interest on your favorite symbol today, [will be published on June 29th](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest), 20 days from now.

My take - irrespective of the other factors, peeps are getting less interested in 30-day options and more interested in 0TDE, 1DTE, etc. This naturally drives the 30-day premiums down - less demand for them.

It\u2019s been upsetting as on oil and gas investor to watch this fucking absolute ass clown in office fuck this up so bad. The rubber band affect is going to play out soon. Rig count is already dropping substantially again like in 2020. This will further decrease supply. The oil companies and investors like me are relatively pissed about how they haven\u2019t let the natural functions of the market play out how they should have all for an election coming up.

     "1. Ironically, it\u2019s Russian oil that is preventing opec from controlling the oil market. Russia needs cash and can\u2019t cut production. I don\u2019t see this changing unless Russia gives up in Ukraine, but even then Russia\u2019s economy will take time to recover.\n2. I absolutely don\u2019t see the case for Jpow cutting rates to address the debt ceiling fallout. JPow was bullied into not raising rates in 2018 and it is clear that was a massive mistake. I don\u2019t think he will make the mistake of using the Fed to fix political economic crisis again. He even said in the FOMC meeting that the debt ceiling is not the responsibility of the Fed. In this case, I believe him. He\u2019s not going to risk his image/legacy to fix the fallout of a MAGA political stunt. The capitulation will have to be political. \n3. A ban on short selling just isn\u2019t going to happen unless a 2008 level event occurs. It won\u2019t be a trigger but a reaction to an already occurring crisis. I don\u2019t think a temporary sell off due to the debt ceiling stunt will qualify. To get political capitulation on the debt ceiling, politicians have to let the stock market suffer in the short term so they can blame the other party for \u2018holding our economy hostage\u2019\n4. Appl may win as the temporary flight to safety play, especially if treasuries are seen as risky given the debt ceiling nonsense."

     "Unpopular opinion but I am bullish on tech stocks. All this news gives no edge. Ever heard of the kansas city shuffle? Its a giant con job where u think youve figured out the con but its actually a double con and what you think is the con is actually the decoy and what ends up happening is the opposite. Think about this: inflating dollar is bearish for the dollar in the long run, which in turn is bearish for bonds. Blue chip stocks especially tech have an inverse correlation so they are probably bullish. Ive had this thesis since late last year and the markets reacted as I was suspecting. Remember this whole thing is a zero-sum game. If the news outlets (who are in bed with the banks and fed and treasury and everyone thats corrupt) are selling bearish news - that's like a sports book offering you a recommended bet. I don't think they want you to win in the long run so in general I would do the opposite of what they're saying is going to happen because they have no repercussions from being \"wrong\" (with their public predictions) and there's nothing stopping jamie from having his traders inverse what he's saying."

It's easy for any professional trader to say that you guys are idiots but I respect what you do, so no hate on my end. Trading is calculated gambling at the end of the day anyway. Compared to you guys, I'm basically a boring stock trader but damn good at it. AAPL is my baby.\\n\\nI'm a swing trader on the 15min chart and 5min, just depends on the price action. I obviously don't win every trade but I shoot for large profits held over 1-3 days so losses don't matter. Willing to help any newbs sometimes and show you what my targets are on certain days when I see good bets.\\n\\nCurrent:\\n\\nFor anyone that messaged me in chat, reddit clears out chats that are too far down on the list so if you don't hear from me in the next day or 2 then I've lost you! Send me a DM rather than a chat request to carry on our convo.\"",

In this period of inflation, consumers are more budget conscious and will most likely skip unnecessary purchases if they're spending thousands more a year on food/gas.

The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasnt broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats. \\n\\nAll of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will '",

Which is getting harder and harder in a world where rent, utilities (my country is seeing record high gas and electricity prices) fuel, etc... are going up and up and up whilst wages stay stagnant.\n\nAlso it may be me but people's view of smartphones and other luxury items has also changed it seems. Buying stuff just for bragging rights doesn't seem to be that much of a thing anymore. From what I see people \"brag\" about not wasting money on the apple product but rather opting for the far cheaper alternative.\n\nDoes anyone remember how in the early to late 2000's we here in the West had this culture around excessive consumption and bragging and flaunting wealth? It was in a lot of our pop culture even pop songs and music videos started implementing advertising in the lyrics (Nelly shilling shoes is an infamous example) Today in many ways feels like the opposite of those times. And it's kind of nice."

So the company has value based on the revenue and profits and almost no value based on stuff it owns. Apple has a huge software component in its valuation."

Book value is primarily impacted by three things: net income, share issuance, and capital return.\n\nApple's BVPS keeps falling because of the buyback. \n\nJust look at their Common Stock line item and their retained earnings. When Apple repurchases shares, that common stock falls by (0.00001 + issuance price) * shares repurchased. The retained earnings falls by the (price paid per share repurchased - issuance price - 0.00001) * shares repurchased. Retained earnings also falls due to Apple's dividend.\n\nRetained earnings = Previous period RE + Net Income - Dividends - Preferred Dividends - Share repurchases. \n\nApple does $100 bn in net income, buys back $90 bn in stock, and pays out $15 bn in dividends. If they didn't return capital to shareholders, you would see their book value skyrocket by $100 bn. \n\nApple will have a negative book value if they keep returning all cash generated to shareholders."

  "Text": "b'For the love of God I need some confirmation bias. You guys need to tell me youre long on aapl so I know Im inversing you. \\n\\nJuicy insider info: Tim apple himself told me they are not having supply chain issues but demand issues cuz their products have been insanely expensive for not much updates. Their products suck now for the average joe that was used to buy apple products for no apparent reason at all. \\nA usable macbook air with up to date specs? $2000\\nThe pro version? $3000\\nA new iPhone? $1500\\nA new iPad? $1000\\n\\nDemand is drying up faster than your wifes box when she listens to your retard ass talking about your losses and blowing another account. Apple has put themselves in a corner. And there is no turning back. \\n\\nThe new iPhone will not come out in September. They will postpone it and have only a low number of iPhones at release date so they can claim they cant keep up with demand. Try to artificially pump up these numbers but unless in the past this time it wont work out. '",

     "Great discussion here. These are the threads that I enjoy most. \n\nI like Tesla in terms of innovation & their domination of the EV market, along with their solar business. With that said, I am bearish on the company. No one can maintain these crazy valuations in this environment. Also, during economic downturns, automotive is the first to take the hit. Taking inflation, PPI, rising interest rates, supply chain issues, increasing competition, etc into consideration...Tesla may find itself in a tight spot in the not so distant future. Don't get me wrong, the company is here to stay, but it won't stop the stock price from returning to a more realistic valuation. The euphoria will die off rather quickly once the big money decides to start heading for the exit."

     "Put your nuts on the line. Make a decision and quit sounding like Jim Cramer.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has just reiterated they are going to raise rates 3X this year (and money is in a full blown panic).\n\nApple at almost 30x earnings (which is held as an inflation hedge for alot of the Scandinavian sovereigns over the last decade) is going south.\n\nTelsa 600x earnings provided the reason for its CEO to dump $20 billion dollars worth of stock in the last 90 days. Did you listen to what Elon said about \"others are valuing my company\"? It's going south.\n\nVISA is scrambling to catch up with blockchain technology (by partnering with Coinbase and whomever else will allow it to get their legacy sticky fingers into their decentralized ecosystems). It's going south.\n\nHere are 3 easy picks. Take one or all. Fear and greed is what fuels the algorithms that provide 87% of the market trading volume in 2022.\n\nDon't over think this stuff."

  "Text": "b\"AAPL is the greatest short investment i've ever seen the market present to investors for the following reasons;\\n\\n\\\\-AAPL normally trades at 12-22PE during a decade of HIGH growth;\\n\\n\\\\-AAPL now is expecting to grow at 1-4% YOY and trades 30-60% above it's average valuation (31PE);\\n\\n\\\\-Demand has been pulled forward years in advance, and its the kind of demand that is not re-occurring. You don't buy a new Macbook every year and the Iphone's hardly change at this point;\\n\\n\\\\-Even the AAPL car at best would bring in 10 Billion by 2026. The market cap is 3 trillion NOW, it's insignificant and laughable;\\n\\n\\\\-China is imploding with real estate being 25% of GDP they are going into a harsh recession now that Evergrande has defaulted. AAPL sales will likely decline.\\n\\n\\\\-WSB has presented Wallstreet with a once in a life time opportunity. Wallstreet invests a massive amount of money in AAPL and FAANG since they have huge market caps that allow them to store a vast amount of their wealth into. Wallstree\"",

This is considered acceptable because it's also heavy and not comfortable to wear on your face for a long time. One of the things they spent the most time showing off is how it's great to just sit back and watch a movie. If it's not comfortable enough to wear for a long time and the battery is less than 90% of movies being release now days then the primary entertainment use case is gone. Using it as a a multi monitor office is also not practical...other VR products have tried it. There are definitely some cool concepts in it but it's not there yet...and 90% of the cool stuff is available in other VR products."

     "TL;DR AAPL is getting hyped for the wrong reasons despite raising the bar on VR technologies. They're instead a strong company backed by major financial institutions and have continued to build a robust and exclusive technology ecosystem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs AAPL bullish? Yes.\n\nIs it entirely because of VR? No.\n\nThere's too much information and history pointing to VR being a flop. It's a technology that is worth developing but it's just *not quite there yet*. Again, AAPL hasn't cracked the code on this... yet.\n\nI say yet, because they actually have a strong shot at taking this technology to the next level, and the reason why is because of their steady focus on size reduction, aesthetic and face tracking technology. We use our faces to express ourselves, this is a major stumbling block in VR where while it may be entertaining, there's still the ever-present feeling that you're either in costume or hanging out with a bunch of puppets. Size and aesthetic are just a given, the current headsets on the market look ridiculous and uncool.\n\nApple is also arguably better at monetization than Facebook has been, and I strongly believe that metaverse developers will step up their game to meet any extra demand brought on by AAPL products, which will increase competition and enrich the community. If you look at the situation as an economist, we all know monopolies aren't efficient in the long run. We need more players in the game like AAPL to spur on further innovation.\n\nDespite all that, that's still not the reason AAPL is bullish in my book. Apple has continued to deepen its ties to financial technology and offers a card backed by Goldman Sachs, the second largest bank *in the world.* Goldman Sachs is a titan in the financial industry and has backing from some of the most elite supporters such as Blackrock and Vanguard.\n\nThe apple card that I mentioned above is made all the more useful with its integration through apple pay, this might not sound like a major innovation but it's a strong addition to the Apple ecosystem of technology from a business standpoint. Apple earns money on interest paid on these cards, which will likely provide small but stable profit for years to come.\n\nDoes this lead me to believe that AAPL is a rocket? No. But I do still have confidence in them to stay in some sort of weird area between being a value and a growth stock."

For the first time I'm selling the earnings pop or protecting whatever the run up price is with a stop loss and I'll get back in with puts. I'm doing that only due to the lack of supply. Apple I have 155 calls and 145 puts but I am holding my position through. I think the earnings beat is baked in already but I'm expecting they will be announcing the new AR this quarter and I hold and capture the middle in options. I think apple has lagged all year despite its recent run and it cod have legs left. My opinion only. I will get back into amd most likely 82 to 85 after it pops to 95 and drops . Fingers crossed. I am deciding while I type if I want to go larger on upside calls and to what risk I'm willing to expose myself to."

Your contract is for 100 shares... by expiration, so many shares will be bought back that it is really like a contract for 120 shares. \\n\\nFor those apes that are new and dont understand buybacks, it is essentially the opposite of shareholder dilution. Companies purchase shares of their own stock and then burn them into thin air. \\n\\nWhat are some other good buyback stocks? I recently learned that 252 companies in S&P are doing buybacks, first time in history that the majority of them are doing so. But I want BIG, steady buybacks for my value LEAPs. \\n\\nId keep stacking shares and buy long expiration calls whenever apple dips 5%'",

Some of you were asking which dividend stocks I plan to buy, and this is not financial advice and DYOR but they include: AAPL, MSFT, NVDA (very small opening position at this price), JPM, SBUX, KO, PG, and O.\\n\\nOf these, at today\\'s (May 25, 2023) prices, my fav starting price positions are for SBUX and O (think these are good price for these 2 stocks especially).

     "Your missing two interesting facts in you analysis which I think are pretty valuable:\n\nRSP significantly underperformed SPY (RSP is the equal weight version of SPY). This basically suggests that as many have insinuated, the market has been dragged higher by the mega caps. With Amazon and Google missing and Apple faltering, if we lose those I think there is a bias to a significant downside.\n\nAlso of note is that the majority of stocks trade below their 200-day moving averages, in other words, most stocks are trending lower. \n\nCouple these items together and it\u2019s sort of a receipt for further downsides to the market. Do I think we crash, No I really don\u2019t think so. Do I think we could go 10% lower, that is a definite possibility."

When Ivy starts brining in recurring revenue, I truly believe this can run up to $500+ per share within the next 5 years.\nDisclaimer.\nI own both nvda and BB shares so not trying to sway people over to BB.

[Last post was AAPL and it did fairly well](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/). \\n\\nPYPL is a global, technology-driven payment platform with hundreds of millions of direct customer relationships in more than 200 countries. It empowers a streamlined digital and mobile payment experience in-browser, on mobile devices, and in-app. PayPal is also accepted at 75%+ of the largest 100 internet retailers.
