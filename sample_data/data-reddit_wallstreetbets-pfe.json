     "**Last year I decided I want to short GM based purely on emotion and for personal revengeful reasons.**\n\nI had no business taking this trade, as it was not in a bearish trend at the time, nor did anything indicate they would take a major fall I was hoping for.\n\nI put my $1000 up anyways and decided to lay down several out of the money put contracts far out - 6 month expiration to expire in December last year.\n\n**After taking some nibbles at puts, I eventually risked my entire account - the whole $1000. Then a few days later (to my advantage) the news hit - our economy was starting to tangle and take on the news of supply chain disruptions - notably the semiconductor shortage became a more frequent topic of concern. This sparked my interest in knowing this will be a game changer for domestic car manufacturer production.**\n\nWhile the news continued to roll out worse and worse each day, my contracts soared almost 700% in just a short few weeks and I decided to take profit.\n\n**My account was now at $6000 give or take. And it just kept on going from there and I slowly started closing multiple contracts several days in a row.**\n\nIt was at this point in September GM started to rise again but the semiconductor shortage and supply chains were actually getting worse by the min - although your president was telling you otherwise. Citing the economy was doing so good! Remember?\n\n**Well I saw right through all of this shit and decided to pick up a new batch of puts on GM with a further out expiration (that being June this year).**\n\nAfter being \"lucky\" and turning my 1k profit into 6k, I decided to only risk about 25% of my account to further my bearish stance on GM, and continued this risk management from that day forward - dabbling into other trades as well.\n\n**Price went against me for several months while GM printed a fake rally despite of the fact we were in a downfall and supply chains just continued to get pummeled.**\n\nI averaged into my GM trades even more the further price rallied.\n\n**I sat on those contracts for several months in a -40% (sometimes even -80%) loss and waited on GM to fall again.**\n\nAnd they did - just recently where I have fully closed them for **even more** profit.\n\n**I also documented every bit of this journey in my Discord in the #gm-yolo-headquarters channel.**"

Any time you double your money half goes back in your pocket and absolutely doesnt come back out. That other half is indeed \"free\". If you double it...half comes put. Another strat is that half your winnings go in your pocket and dont come out. Have 100..win 20..10 goes in.  On bad nights you still lose your 1000. But on insane nights you dont win 50k and leave broke...you leave with at least 25k or much more. You bring home say 10k. You go back next day with 5 k. You do NOT increase your pool to 5k that night.\nTge casinos rely on you doing the opposite of this \"hey i won 10k..ill raide my pool to 5 and put the rest away. An hour later..'well i lost 5 but its free money ill whip out another 2500\"\n\nWjen gambling your ONLY real power is over your bet. Anything else is delusion"

Buy Pfizer calls. 7/17 38c is my position. \\n\\nIf you don't read the news you might not know that Trump has shortlisted Pfizer, JNJ, Merck, MRNA, AZN for operation warp speed (NYT article)\\n\\nPfizer is a great play, they will be releasing Phase 1/2 data by the end of the month and are collaborating with BNTX. \\n\\nThey are incidentally doing the largest vaccine trial involving 18-80 age group (looking at you INO) and across 3 different markets (Europe, the USA and China). \\n\\nPfizer are so confident in their vaccine they are outsourcing production of their patented drugs to increase manufacturing capacity for these vaccine candidates. Yes, candidates. They have 4 candidates in trial. \\n\\nWhile BNTX being the junior partner would potentially get a greater share of the gains, a quick glance at BNTX calls shows really really fucking high IV, whereas Pfizer calls are in the 20s% as I write this.  BNTX options are also manipulated to shit and I know this from personal experience. \\n\\nAnoth\"",

Now the public has just said through rioting that there are no more fucks to be given bout the 'rona as all fucks are given towards police brutality. \n\nXLV took a dip but was right back up to ATH before one could blink. It out performed everything except recently tech overtook it. \n\nNo more 'rona checks are coming, Fed isn't handing anyone money after the riots and now the news doesn't give a shit about COVID as it's protest/riot coverage 24/7, and come July those extra unemployment checks stop. People will no longer have health coverage nor money to pay for shit. The Fed is now less focused on Corona and the pressure on the FDA to get it done disappears and they go back to their normal, glaciers move faster, speed. \n\nPlus R&D is about to be fucked up for a year as no college labs, now this may improve the budgets as R&D is the biggest expense, but also means nothing in the pipeline to cover the drops when patents expire and their shit becomes generic."

The better comparison is MRNA and BNTX. \n\n1. Pfizer is an established pharma company with 300+ products, they\u2019re already worth way more than Moderna by market cap. \n\n2. Moderna owns the mRNA tech that they built the vaccine on. They\u2019re valued on the potential of that technology, not just the covid vaccine. Pfizer is not an mRNA company.\n\n3. BioNTech own the tech that the Pfizer vaccine was built on and they have a 50:50 split agreement. Even if The PFE/BNTX vaccine sells twice as many doses as the MRNA vaccine, PFE will only get half of that revenue.\n\nMRNA and BNTX are both mRNA biotech companies and their valuations are based on growth potential. PFE is the beneficiary of an agreement with BNTX to co-market their COVID vaccine. Besides that deal, PFE is the same company it was before the pandemic, so the growth valuations on the mRNA companies shouldn\u2019t apply to PFE. Obviously, the vaccine is very valuable but PFE has already gained $60B in market cap this month."

You and I are hoping to sell our calls to someone who wants a position or larger one in PFE. They could have just bought and hedged with puts. \n\nPFE dumped the morning after EUA was granted, and dumped the next day, and the next week. I realized yesterday it was a runup of fools hoping to sell to a greater fool after eua. The same goes for the full auth runup. I\u2019m straddling tomorrow but more put dominant. \nWill hold far otm spreads for a pop.

Were in a public health crisis, and its great the government is going to be providing a vaccine for Americans.\\n\\n-The government is giving Pfizer a \"due date\" (again, NY Times): \"The contract is part of what the White House calls the Warp Speed project.\"\\n\\n-Trump will announce that \"We have the vaccine!\" no matter what Pfizer actually has, because he pumps markets and people around him are saying a cure to the coronavirus is his only hope.

     "I'm really looking forward to seeing MRNA fly once all of this shorting finally gives out. So much BS in here. I'll highlight your 'analysis' of the P1 data. News flash, a mild or moderate fever after getting a vaccine is very common, and indicates that your body is mounting an immune response to the antigen; i.e. it indicates that the vaccine is working. None of the patients in 100 ug dose cohort experienced severe fever, and overall the safety profile for that dose looks very good. There has been no pushback from FDA or NIH on Moderna's clinical testing timeline due to this data. These kinds of posts always seem to leave out that 100% of the 100 ug cohort produced neutralizing antibodies, all of which had titres well above the median titres from convalescent plasma. This is an indication of 100% efficacy (admittedly this may not equate to 100% disease prevention but neutralizing antibody titres are arguably the best available metric if disease prevention is not assessed), which is a very significant achievement in any clinical study.\n\nThe study design critique is also laughable. Moderna has been working hand-in-hand with NIH and FDA for not only development support but also on clinical study design. The phase 3 study will be conducted almost exactly how FDA wants it. (This also goes for the other companies pursuing vaccines, because they are also working closely with NIH/FDA).\n\nOn the topic of insider selling, I don't disagree with you that it seems shady. I only partially buy Bancel's argument that it is all standard, pre-planned selling in a locked-in schedule. I wouldn't be surprised if they timed some of their press releases to make those stock sales more favorable. But the thing is, it is possible for a pharma company to have greedy execs and also bring safe/effective products to market. It might be news to you, but it is actually quite common that pharma execs are greedy and do shady things.\n\nYour manufacturing comment is poorly researched, MRNA has had contracts secured with large CMO's for months now to achieve the manufacturing volume that they are reporting.\n\nOne last note, regarding the apparent difference in the drug substance doses for Moderna/BioNTech: what ultimately matters is for the dose that you use, can you achieve a high rate of sufficient efficacy and safety? I.e. if Moderna's dose is just as (or more) effective and just as (or more) safe as the dose that BioNTech selects, the difference really doesn't matter from a therapeutic standpoint.\n\nI have exposure to MRNA and PFE. Both are going to do well."

The combined revenue from these two products is estimated to be $21.5 billion in 2023, compared to $56.7 billion in 2022. However, if we were to exclude the Covid-19 products, the companys sales of everything else will likely trend higher.

This already presents a barrier to smaller companies that cannot muster the logistics to organise and carry out such a study. It improves the advantage of larger companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Although Moderna captured early hype and headlines in the USA for promising early stage results, it will likely lag behind larger companies in crossing the finish line for Phase 3 (see google trends graphic linked below).

Historically viruses evolve to be less lethal because killing your host is a bad way to keep spreading. The truth is many of us have likely already encountered a coronavirus in our lives, but it just felt like a cold.\n\nFrom what I understand covid will likely be here evolving andinfecting us forever like many other similar viruses. At worst it'll be as lethal as the flu and we will have to keep guessing at what strain is gonna be most prevalent and try to get people vaccinated yearly. At best it'll just change into another annoying cold."

     "I am going to add something else to your post which by the way I find quite compelling thematically, we could have quite the debate about why PFE and BioNTech are or aren't good investment.\n\nAs you have somewhat pointed out, in the short term not much money is going to be made. That is a well understood phenomenon in biotech. A tangential example would be the scarce development of new antibiotics. New compounds are really expensive to develop and once one is found governments regulate the shit out of them because of how absolutely fucking important they become.\n\nNow, what is at play here, something truly transformational is the technology behind this (and several competing) vaccines. PFE/BioNTech [BNT162](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNT162) is an mRNA vaccine. Instead of injecting some \"weakened\" form of the pathogen and hoping for the body to be like \"oh heck you shouldn't be here\" and mount an immune response without killing you in the process, an mRNA vaccine consists on isolating some part of the genetic material of the virus, stabilizing it and then injecting it in your body. Inside your cells the genetic material is converted into the corresponding protein, and if effective, an immune response is obtained. PFE/BioNTech HAVE JUST SHOWN THAT THIS FUCKING IDEA WORKS!! Yeah, everybody was expecting for it to work, but they actually did. That means they have a bunch of data and expertise to guess what?.?.?.? DEVELOP many more vaccines!!! Not only against microbes, but also for practically any agent. Cancer? Sure, just look for the mutational signatures most likely to enhance an immune response. Dementia? Sure, just go through the dozens of genetic markers associated with protein aggregation in the nervous system. Aging? Hell yeah, a lot has been uncovered about the biology of senescent cells which can be targeted and treated.\n\nAs you mentioned this is a pivotal moment for the human race. Do you think this is all bullshit speculation? Fair enough, there are many challenges ahead and a lot of charlatans will emerge. Will only these two companies emerge victorious?  Absolutely no. You shall all be very excited. THIS IS NOT INVESTING ADVICE!!  \n\n\nBNTX 01/21/22 C140.000  \n\n\nstock\n\nPFE, MRNA, BioNTech, PACB, ILMN"

When looking at the chart of the relative strength vs other major stocks and indicies, PFE looks primed for a rally.  In particular, I like the relative strength of PFE vs the QQQs.  The PFE:QQQ ratio looks to have bottomed out.  That provides good safety for traders.\\n\\nNFLX > PFE > USO\\n\\nI ranked the 3 stocks above by rally potential.  NFLX is still in the infancy of a rally.  PFE is next up.  USO rallied a decent amount already, so some of the rally potential has been used up.\\n\\nIf you are interested in the short side, I have a few stocks that are what I consider bearish.  However, I wouldn't short them in this environment because of the high liquidity.\\n\\nT > GLD > HD\\n\\nT has the highest short potential of the 3.\"",

Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investments price.\\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\\n\\n\\nUptrending Tickers\\n\\n\\n* CMA   5/19/23   40C   1.30\\n* TFC'",

The issue is how to tell the player which move to make - so there was a hupothesis that Hans Niemann inserted vibrating anal beads in his ass and was told the moves in morse code via the vibrations. \n\nElon Musk decided to weigh in as he always does.\n\nIn a subsequent tournament, Hans was searched and scanned with a metal detector. Particular attention was paid to his ass and onlookers couldnt contain their amusement. \n\nSo yes, chess, anal beads and now wsb. Enjoy."

Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investments price.\\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\\n\\nUptrending Tickers\\n\\n* PLUG   2/24/23 15.5C    1.09\\n* VMW'",

Chinese \"Do not\" trust local Chinese brands that deal with medication, if there is a foreign alternative the local Chinese will always go with the foreign brand.  This is a transition for them to eventually allow official foreign MRNA approval.  This is all about not making XI look dumb for being overly nationalistic."

     "AMD, NVDA, and DIS... all beaten down waaaaaaay too far.\n\nAMD and NVDA are refreshing their product lines between fall 2022 and spring 2023. Major refresh. New GPUs will be 2-3x faster than current ones. AMD's CPUs will have big arch improvements.\n\nDemand for their chips is still high. Current GPUs are 2 years old and close to end-of-production but still selling above MSRP and difficult to find.\n\nAlso, many analysts are worried about a chip glut or a gaming slowdown. There won't be a chip glut for at least several years (production capacity hasn't increased in a major way for years and won't increase until 2024 plus the upcoming product refresh will actually INCREASE demand) and any gaming slowdown is basically temporary plus these companies don't just make gaming GPUs, they have very healthy non-gaming segments like AI/ML, automotive, HPC, and datacenter.\n\nDomestic supply chains for both AMD and NVDA will improve greatly as TSMC's 5nm fab in AZ opens up in 2023 and ramps up to full blast by 2024.\n\nDisney has a ton of high-demand content coming out soon (KENOBI) plus more growth from parks/experiences coming as travel becomes more expensive and going to Disney World becomes a far cheaper/better option than going to Europe or the Bahamas.\n\nBonus pick: GFS... They're going to take over the 2nd tier fabbing we do overseas and turn it domestic. That's critical for the US's effort to De-Chinese-ify American businesses.\n\nNot sure why people keep pumping money into energy... the west is trying to shrink usage of Oil and Nat gas asap. Not shift, SHRINK.\n\nAKA - large-scale Oil and Nat gas demand destruction is happening as we speak. Energy seems like a dumb play."

They\u2019ve also got a very powerful edge network of servers all around the world which forms a huge moat. They are adding customers like crazy, over 150k customers spending more than a million year. This company\u2019s goal isn\u2019t just to protect the internet, it\u2019s to become the next AWS.

I rarely buy any options, calls, puts etc\u2026 I invest small amounts on my long term investment with stocks that are under $50 (to buy the most stock for the least amount of money) and keep buying the dips on those that have dropped quite of bit by adding small amounts. My long term portfolio also helps me by big bets on my short term portfolio because I have been watching closely how my long term stocks been performing or any news of those stock. So I buy a lot and trade for a day or a few days. My short term portfolio also helps me buy more expensive stocks for short term trade. This helps me lose a little and gain a little but with a long term short gains instead of yoloing one stock."

The rise in 2015 is due to the lower cost of sales. On the other hand, the operating profit margin is expected to rise to ~37.0% in 2015 from 26.8% in 2014. Its further expected to improve to ~38.3% in 2016 and ~39.3% in 2017.

It says it itself if you actually go to the source and not the sensationalized journalism:\n\n>The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak. As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented because of detection bias. Third, demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants; further study is underway to identify other population characteristics among cases, such as additional demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions.\\*\\*\\* MA DPH, CDC, and affected jurisdictions are collaborating in this response; MA DPH is conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples for genomic sequencing, and linking case information with laboratory data and vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load.\u2020\u2020\u2020 Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings."

LMAO\n\nIt\u2019s just a study of atoms, structures, reactions & energy.\n\nIf one likes going against the general population, well then you would have taken Covid seriously since early last year when the general population ignored it. Now that the masses realize the complexity of a virus, now isn\u2019t the time to be \u201cagainst\u201d the norm. \n\nEveryone has a right to choose to be or not to be vaccinated. Everyone has the right to choose if they wish to use their brain or not.  \n\nPerhaps the silver lining is a decrease in the tard population.\n\nShow me any part of the world with low education & I\u2019ll show you a much higher concentration of tards in those areas: extremists, cults, conspiracy theorists, fanatics & fascists.  After all, it wasn\u2019t that long ago people were burning witches."

Hospitalisations and deaths have remained low because we have vaccinated so many.  Honestly covid doesn\u2019t feel like much of a threat any more.  \n\nMore damage was done to the economy by an overblown reaction to the disease than the disease itself, and I don\u2019t think the govt would impose a lockdown again as public sentiment is now so heavily in favour of just getting on with our lives."

     "Anti-vaccine and electoral madness aside, is anyone else feeling like mRNA vaccines are beginning to look like a bit of a con job? Why weren\u2019t inactivated virus vaccines given EUA? The data from Israel, whose vaccine strategy was very much like ours, suggests  the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine is reduced by 1/2 every 3-4 weeks. Now, I\u2019m not saying that there are dishonest players in big pharma who used their lobbying clout to get Pfizer a 27B deal for a questionable product, but it seems as Pfizer lobbyists perhaps used their clout in DC to get a 27B deal for a questionable product, and now they are pushing for booster shots for a vaccine that perhaps doesn\u2019t work that well. \n\nInactivated Virus vaccines create t-cells that can ward off infection potentially for years. Also, antivax people can\u2019t shout weird things about genetic modifications with these vaccines. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying, actually, is I\u2019m buying OCGN calls on Monday. Covaxin is likely getting WHO approval this month, they have a manufacturing plant set up in US,  they have the right to sell in Canada who will perhaps provide doses to the rest of the world. So even if the FDA is as cognitively deficient as joe biden himself and we don\u2019t get Covaxin, that Stock is gonna pump with WHO approval and then I\u2019m moving to Europe while the US turns into the Last of Us."

There has been a barrage of positive news, and omicron being milder is the only plausible reason for the selloff. But the drop is incommensurate with the rise when Omicron fear gripped the market. \n\nThe drop is irrational for another reason - a variant which spreads faster and has some vaccine/immune evasion is precisely the impetus to boost AND to mix and match the booster dose. At an individual level, if you must get infected, you might prefer Omicron over Delta, but at the community level, something that spreads 5x faster and does 0.5x less harm is exactly you would urgently want to vaccinate/boost against if you have the means. This applies to the richest countries where the tier 1 profits come from. \n\nOf course, we're all familiar with how important NVAX is for the rest of the world to control the pandemic."

     "Yes and no. I think the only thing that\u2019s going to lift this is actually reporting revenue, and that\u2019s not going to happen until Q2 2022 at the earliest. They have 3 main clients, Operation Warp Speed, the EU member states, and doses sold through covax. However, deliveries to all three of those are still months away. \n\nUSA: there is a new 30 day waiting period after a submission. If they submit before the end of the year (possible not guaranteed), there\u2019s a 30 day delay. Then the FDA starts reviewing the application. This will probably take around 2 months (based on Pfizer + Moderna EUA). So the absolute earliest they can deliver doses is March, right after the entire country has finished being boosted. \n\nEU:  they have a contract to deliver up to 200M doses, however individual member states have only ordered 27M against that capacity. And 3 member states (Italy, Denmark, Austria) have said they will expect deliveries in late February/early March at the earliest.\n\nCovax: The manufacturer for covax is the same as for EU (Serum Institute). Logically, if it will take > 2-3 months for deliveries to start to the EU, it\u2019ll be about the same delay for Covax as well, since the manufacturer is the same. \n\nThe wild card is India, but there\u2019s political fuckery going on there. They seem to think that the other locally produced vaccine is a source of Indian pride, (although it is of course made under license, like novavax). So no guarantees there. \n\nBasically, they are 2-3 months away from any revenue at all, and then probably 5-6 months away from significant revenue, since the serum institute still has to scale up production. The shorts won\u2019t let go of it until then. And the longer they delay, the riskier it gets. There\u2019s going to actually be a huge oversupply of doses in 2022, if they can\u2019t get this thing out soon countries will source their vaccines from other suppliers, and they\u2019ll be stuck picking up the scraps Pfizer doesn\u2019t want."

Vax stocks are losing their sex appeal/meme appeal, see the charts of MRNA and BNTX both down roughly 50% from their 2021 highs. \n\nI would still not discount a white swan event (opposite of black swan) where covid fades away which would be a white swan for everyone but a black swan for the vax makers.

     "BNTX and Pfizer have  59% of the Vax market, throw in Moderna, and you have over 90% of the market accounted for.  Covid vaccine retention for the two market leaders is over 90%. People will usually take the same vaccine.   Revenue is very sticky.  NVAX is very late to the game, even given its alternative formula.  To make inroads in market share is a tough get at this late date.  \n\nRight now, there is no good news that is able to provide a positive catalyst for the vaccine stocks.  Doesn't seem to matter what is forthcoming, new approvals, new exploding mutations, plainly obvious need for new vaccines to treat new mitations, incredible new orders, huge order books, promising pipelines, ---the Vax stocks are getting hammered and the charts look bearishly  bleak.\n\nDoes it make sense???  BNTX is at 253, it was 460 in August and is the quarter's worst NASDAQ performer, and the pandemic isn't getting better and the positive catalyst have come and gone left and right.   At its current SP, it's P/E is like 7.  It is wildly oversold and incredibly cheap, as is perhaps NVAX.  But it's only going lower from the looks of it.  Perhaps the Vax stocks are going down because people who bought in August over 400 are bailing out for tax purposes.  However, it is highly probable that these stocks are being manipulated by the big boys, given the trading patterns that are happening.  One thing for sure in my mind, it's crazy to buy options with this group.  Moderna leads the pack as it is included in many ETFs, and all of them are trading as a sector, and the sector is on a solid downtrend.  Not sure if the sector constitutes a falling dagger, but it's close to it the last few days.  But the whole sector is volatile, and has had near 100 point swings at least 3 times since August.  So you never know.  But I'd pick an entry point carefully at this point, the sector is likely to go lower in the short term.  Might be a better idea to day trade also, and if you get ahead, under no circumstances use a stop loss.\n\nLonger term, Pfizer and BNTX are making billions, and the fundamentals are sound.  Their next earning reports will be blowouts, they will not miss, but if they are on the beat but light side, or provide poor guidance, a 20%;dump is totally probable.  If you have the stomach for being heavily red at times, and can invest biggly and are the gambling type, the payoff could be hughe if you can wait it out, if not, play in a different sector."

Moderna missed earning last week and reduced the guidance for 2021; this reduction was not driven by lack of demand, it was driven by delays in manufacturing. BNTX-PFE jumped in and took over the demand Moderna failed to serve. The current drop is still an overreaction of the market to the Pfizer anti-viral which cause a lot of Stop/Loss drops and liquidation of call options.\\n\\nPfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be $13 Bn, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from $33 Bn to $36 Bn. Consensus estimate is $12.27 EPS Q3. We estimate a somewhat better result, $12.75 at minimum, driven by a/o higher sales volume and improved financing result. Similar to what happened to this stock for Q4 2020 earning on March 31st 2021, the most likely scenario is a rally starting directly after the Q3 earnings.\\n\\n'",

If you\u2019re poor I\u2019m guessing you also don\u2019t have a good career or prospect for a good career.  Why not find a good and well paying career path that you like and you want to go down and use that $200k to pay for an education for that career path and for living expenses while you do that.  If you choose a 4 year degree you could probably stretch that money out all 4 years.  If not then you can at least stretch it out for 2-3 years while you get good grades and can then qualify for grants and scholarships.  You are very unlikely to create an income you can live off of comfortably and safely for a long time off of $200k.  Use the money to invest in yourself and you will always have the ability to generate a lot of income for yourself.\n\nEngineering pays really well for example, and you really only need a bachelor\u2019s degree.  You can go into computer science or computer engineering and become a programmer, also high paying and also only needs a bachelor\u2019s.  Data science as well I believe.  Or you can go down a trade route.  Maybe an electrician or an auto mechanic?  Research what these jobs typically pay and their growth outlook, and then pick one that you would enjoy doing.  You have an opportunity here to set yourself up for life, don\u2019t squander it."

There is a set market for video streaming and with Netflix's numbers coming out we saw they are not gaining as many users as before, my thesis is that Dis+ took most of it with better kid friendly content. https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fg%2F11f5bxylc0\\n\\n\\nWe saw what Snap did when Facebook reported they were losing marketshare, I am adopting the same thesis to Disney taking Netflix marketshare. Not to mention Encanto being one of Disneys biggest movies this quarter - https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=encanto\\n\\n\\nOn Vaccines we know that more and more people are vaccinated and with both theme parks open we should see more and more people heading to parks. With JnJ reporting massive vaccine sales we should see MRNA and PFE also report the same which just means more people are vaccinated.

     "Not a fan of the Disney app.  It\u2019s by far worse than Netflix, Amazon, FuboTV, YouTubeTV, even peacock and DirectTV stream.  For one, it\u2019s missing several basic features.  Play from beginning, the ability to scroll through an episode or season without having to start whichever one was already going and back out and go back in.  The coding makes the overall app slow, which make basic features like the plus minus 10/15 second feature not work efficiently.  It lacks good information offer apps have when the show is playing.  Apart from that, it still doesn\u2019t have a lot of content, although the quality of content is top notch. The only good thing about the Disney plus app is the content, but the software is garbage.  They need to hire extensively several more software engineers and look at making some acquisitions.  They are moving to live TV now, streaming an upcoming awards show. I\u2019m skeptical it will work well since their current app is already so far behind where it needs to be."

There is no Novavax delay, we just applied for EUA in the UK today. There IS, however, a Bharat delay, they got a \"talk to the hand\" from the WHO yesterday. Bear in mind, the WHO application has NOTHING to do with Ocugen, which does not have any sales agreements at all, much less any commercialization rights in any countries that give a flying fuck about the WHO. Lastly, you can't supply what you don't produce, and Ocugen is currently producing... nothing.So, fail, fail, fail, fail, fail. Nice job."

In fact a lot of athletes use steroids during the off season to train and then stop before it is time to test. BUT! **mRNA is completely untraceable.** ***\"The new frontier of performance enhancing drugs!\"*** Athletes could juice all the way up to the competitions. Think about all the records they could break!\\n\\nIt\\'s the perfect market! Athletes have been resistant to vaccination because they don\\'t know what it may do to their bodies.

Novavax (NVAX) is slightly behind Pfizer/Moderna/AZN/JnJ in the COVID vaccine race but will likely end up with the **most effective vaccine** with the **fewest side effects** and will be the **easiest to distribute,** as if only requires standard refrigeration (4 degrees Celsius).\\n2. Many people think that the \\\\~95% efficacy data from PFE/MRNA means that we're in the clear, but the data refers to 95% prevention of **symptomatic disease and not 95% prevention of infection**, which is an important difference that has been largely overlooked. **Based on pre-clinical and Phase 1 clinical data, I think NVAX will be significantly better at not only preventing symptomatic disease, but also better at preventing infection and transmission.**\\n3. Importantly, NVAX's COVID vaccine (NVX-CoV2327) is the **only candidate that can be multiplexed with a flu vaccine resulting in a long-term revenue stream beyond the initial wave of vaccinations** providing a convenient option in the \"",

     "Fellow Pretty Huge Dick in-training here--NVAX's vaccine is *stellar* on all metrics: excellent CD4+ response in patients, high antibody titers after second dosage, highly-scalable, and has realistic storage conditions for the developing world/ rural US. Their broad cytokine profiles are even good. This vaccine is probably the best to emerge in this entire year (I've been with them since February) and will singlehandedly save us if new strains emerge and we need annual vaccinations to keep COVID at-bay.   \n\n\nHowever, we shouldn't forget that Novavax is a *horrible company to bet on*. Also, in 3-4 months *no one will care* *about their COVID vaccine anymore;* I see this stock dropping sub-70. Follow the pump for awhile but be sure to gtfo quick and just buy shares when the price drops. Not to blatantly disagree but there won't be an acquisition--Sanofi would be the only realistic candidate to buy them out and they probably don't have the cash flow for that (and their own vaccine candidate to deal with). NVAX is on their own here.   \n\n\nWeirdly, I actually think there's real long-term potential for NVAX to grow in India as a flu+COVID vaccine provider with the Serum Institute. Trivalent flu vaccines are egg-based, which may not be favored amongst the stricter vegetarian populations in North India. Yes NVAX's vaccine is made in Sf9 cells (which isn't technically veg) but it can fit India's current vegetarian labelling system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian\\_and\\_non-vegetarian\\_marks#:\\~:text=Packaged%20food%20and%20toothpaste%20products,%2Dvegetarian%20and%20non%2Dvegetarian.&text=According%20to%20the%20law%2C%20vegetarian,food%20with%20a%20brown%20symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_and_non-vegetarian_marks#:~:text=Packaged%20food%20and%20toothpaste%20products,%2Dvegetarian%20and%20non%2Dvegetarian.&text=According%20to%20the%20law%2C%20vegetarian,food%20with%20a%20brown%20symbol).). I actually think NVAX bomb in the US market (unless we need annual boosters) but will be great in India's emerging annual vaccine market."

     "Too much to science and not enough time dedicated to the actual team running NVAX.  I will never, ever trust anything from NVAX until they actually demonstrate that they can execute.  NVAX has been around for 30+ years and has never made a single new drug.  Even for biotech, going 30+ years with never making a new drug is excessively long.  NVAX, however, once had a vaginal cream product....that they sold for a loss.  Time and time again NVAX promises the moon whenever there is an emerging public health threat.  They were supposed to delivery on a vaccine for MERS and Ebola....yet years later where are they?  NVAX constantly promotes hype for a new vax against a public health threat; the stock gets pumped; NVAX sells shares to raise cash; NVAX doesn't deliver; the stock tanks, and then hopefully by then the next emerging health threat arrives to repeat the cycle over again.  It's truly amazing how they're able to keep this company running repeating the same schtick over and over and over again.  People forget that NVAX fell into penny stock territory and was about to get delisted from NASDAQ right before COVID hit.  They had to reverse split to save the share price.  NVAX has a long history of dilutions, which was masked with the reverse split.  And here we are with COVID.  Yet again, immediately as the stock was driven on hype, management does another share offering to raise more cash.  So the cycle continues.  This is the same management, who btw, stands to reap $100M in stop option bonuses after Uncle Sam's cash infusion.  The bonuses aren't even tied to having to actually deliver a product to market.  Management will get their payday no matter what.  Somehow, someway, NVAX will eventually fuck up their Ph3 trial....it's in their blood."

You mention some positive data may come from the Phase 3 trial over in London in a few weeks, but any catalyst potential is diluted given all the vaccine news being thrown out there lately. I'm not sure investors will immediately react with glee to Novavax's own version when it finally rolls out.\n\nI think the key thing here is contracts. Given everything you said about NVAX's vaccine, it's only a matter of time before local/state/federal governments realize NVAX's solution is superior by a mile. The problem is that politicians are desperate to kill this thing as quickly as possible, so they'll likely go for whatever horse comes out of the gate first. It's going to be at least a year before they realize NVAX provides the better bang for the buck.\n\nThis is probably a play for the second half of next year."

So I share this with the hopes of receiving feedback and not asshole downvotes. 4) Im not posting any math because every time I do, people downvote or it just doesnt get any attention. So Im going to keep this pretty high level. The math is pretty easy though if youre interested. Just look at potential market size of a drug and assume you capture a small conservative percentage of that market (look at analogous drugs in the sector). \\n\\nMy argument: Now is the time to buy OPK  \\n\\nWhy/thesis: \\n\\nOpk just received approval on its pro'",

As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)). Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!\\n2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works. Therefore, US demand will literally be capped tits high until more of the US population is fully vaccinat\"",

     "$AUPH has a best-in class Lupus treatment. They have no competition. Well, they do have competition, but their oral medication has superior results over the more invasive treatment that their competitor offers. So it's a no brainer\n\nThing is, they have very few sales (500 people getting treatment out of a potential market of 1.5 million). Due to the timing of the treatment coming of age, it is pretty apparent their lack of sales is due to Covid and lack of access to doctors. So at the moment, IIRC, they are burning through cash with no apparent way to make it up. This is probably why the short interest is so high (about 18% (edit: this number may have changed since I last looked)). As a note, a week or so ago, they went on a hiring spree for sales people (or at least, there was a screenshot of job openings that just came available). Sales people is likely their only barrier to massive growth (thing is, they would never need sales people if they were acquired by a major pharma with a huge sales team, and I think they know that)\n\nIIRC, according to patent filings, they don't have a pipeline worth mentioning. A buy out is their only option. $35-$45 per share are the speculated buyout numbers. In fact, as history tells us, companies like this are designed and built for buyouts. I can't imagine any way they'll get BO by monday, or even this week. Maybe in 3-4 months\n\nThey had a fake buyout announcement a week ago which seemed to have driven the stock price from $14 to $20. They have a ton of short interest so OP's post makes sense to me.\n\nThis is just informational, and is all publicly available information that you can get from reloading twitter then reading filings. I'm not an advisor or even know what I'm talking about."

For those looking for a new trade, I will outline why NVAX is de-risked and remains enormously undervalued, even with the 26% pop since data was released today. **I will also explain the significance of the results and why the reduced efficacy against the SA variant is bad news for the world, but actually presents a huge opportunity for NVAX and moreso than any of the other vaccine makers**. For those who didnt read my previous posts, I worked in vaccine R&D for several years and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n***Tldr: Despite the confusing headlines, todays data confirm that NVAX has a highly effective vaccine on par with PFE/MRNA and will allow them to lock in the billions of dollars of existing supply deals.

     "NVAX price analysis\n\nThis stock is extremely undervalued for the following reasons. Ill go into detail\n\n1. 2 billion annual production capacity\n2. 1.7 billion in contracts\n3. Lower efficacy for SA strain means people will need a booster every 6-12 months\n4.  mrna strains will not be able to provide boosters for multiple strains at once like novavax\n5.  Novavax is only company in world to test a flu/covid combo in a phase 3 trial (UK)\n6. Nanoflu will become the market leading flu vaccine\n7.  The potential for an annual flu/covid booster is enormous.\n\n1. So the first one is pretty straight forward.  8 manufacturing facilities in 7 countries including the massive facility at serum institute.  Serum Institute expects it to cost about $2 to produce each dose.\n\n2. Novavax has contracts with US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, EU, India, Israel, Philippines, and all poor/middle income countries via CEPI.  about 1 billion of the annual doses will be sold via cepi for a profit of .50 a dose.  The other billion are close to $16. cost on those may be closet to $4 a dose and a portion of those are partner shares via japan south Korea.  lets say 700 million with $12 profit and 300 million with $6 profit.  Thats .5 Billion plus 8.4 billion, plus 3 billion.   11.9 billion annual profits for the best in class vaccine...\n\n3. The lower efficacy was actually good news for vaccine manufacturers as it means demand will be perpetual (like flu) as vaccine companies will need to protect against different strains. (as a result of the JNJ and NVAX data JPMorgan increased their expected covid vaccine market size\n4. Going forward, the mrna vaccines are at a disadvantage in responding to multiple variants due to the side effects.  They are unlikely to be able to increase dose size as demonstrated by all Moderna phase 1 participants getting very sick with the high dose(100% had fever over 101).  novavax went with their 5 dose instead of 25.  Both were safe and equally effective.  This means novavax could easily give a booster for 5 variants.\n5. 400 participants were tested with a flu/covid combo in uk trial.\n6  often forgotten is Nanoflu which beat the market leader in head to head phase 3 comparison for all 5 flu strains.  Flu market is 4.1 billion for over 65 and nanoflu is positioned to capture a large portion of that.\n7. So um who isnt going to want a flu/covid booster? This is why Ra capitol invested early.  They saw the potential.  Who wouldn\u2019t want the best in class flu and best in class covid vaccine combined??  This is going to be HUGE..........\n\nSo in summary we\u2019re looking at 11.9 billion in profits... before even talking about income from nanoflu or the future covid/flu combo which is going to be the most demanded vaccine in history.  We now know there will be annual boosters needed due to reinfection rate seen in nvax and jnj trials as well as the new strain being less effective.  Other future strains are bound to happen and will also require different boosters.\n\n11.9 billion times 20x PE is 230 billion... Thats a stock price of 3570... even before accounting for increased sales from nanoflu/covid combo."

I'd like to see Novavax develop a trivalent consisting of original covid strain and the SA and possibly Brasil variants.  No way mrna vaccines at 100ug/dose could formulate a trivalent without inducing severe reactions.  They would have to develop separate vaccines for each strain.  Their manufacturing is already max'd out and can't meet the current demands.  How the hell are they going to handle 2 additional vaccines?  Additionally, the cost would be astronomical.     \n\nNovavax is positioned beautifully here.  They could create a bi, tri or quad in their sleep.  Hopefully they keep expanding on manufacturing - they're going to need it.\n\nHope you keep posting - great stuff!"

     "Yea I work for mgm resorts in Vegas. Occupancy rates on the weekends are 50-60%, but during the week we're at 17-25%. Its going to be a really rough quarter. This is generally our slow season, but we get through it with a handful of good conventions in October and November, then rodeo in December. The week between Christmas and New Years is generally our biggest week to recover from the slow period, bolstered by tourists coming mainly from Europe and Asia. All those conventions are gone, New Years Eve celebration is cancelled, and I don't see us having that travel into the states from countries that are also locked down. \n\nWe always look forward to January and February, as those are traditionally our biggest months bolstered by some massive conventions, including CES, but those are gone too. March is usually great due to a few conventions+ March madness.\n\nSo really, our turnaround might happen in March if March madness isn't completely canceled, and we start to see vaccine distribution in late spring, though I think it will be mid summer at the earliest.\n\nThe one thing that MGM does have going for it, it went with an \"asset lite\" strategy over the last few years, selling the physical land and buildings that the hotels and casinos to a reit, while retaining operations of the casinos. So the MGM has a TON of cash on hand to ride out the storm. Even so, I've been perplexed by the recent upswing in ticker price. \n\nJust my two cents."

     "I generally like the play.  I had LVS shares and calls but got out a bit too early when it crossed $52.  Because it's changing its focus to Singapore and Macau and trying to sell Vegas I don't want to buy puts for the slight dip it will likely take on the inevitable pullback, but MGM remains a stretched company that was just starting to re-org when Covid hit.  Horrible, horrible timing for them.\n\nA couple of things to consider:  There will likely be a stimulus pop.  Maybe more than one.  The Presidential contest becomes less important by the day and members of Congress know that they're all being blamed for inaction.  Believe it or not, they're sensitive to that.  Both parties.\n\nBUT, I think you're missing a bigger downside catalyst:  Conventions.   Vegas makes its money on convention traffic.  The holidays you mention that they're going to lose are gravy.  They're going to be missing the main course for almost another year.\n\nConventions have long lead times for planning/logistics of all involved.  Most of the big ones have cancelled into next summer.  Even if everyone is vaccinated by April, I doubt you really see conventions come back full force for over a year.  Zoom will replace a lot of this corporate expense.\n\nI'll start watching for an entry point for puts (and for my comfort level, a little longer time horizon).  Good write up.   Best of luck, and thanks."

This already happened once back in June, when the initial outbreak started to decline. Medical experts already anticipated worsening conditions in the Fall/Winter, but it didn't matter until it did.\n\nI suspect Covid has already mutated into different strains at this point and I wouldn't be surprised if the vaccines end up being about as effective as the flu shot is, which could dump its efficiency down into the 40-60% range."
