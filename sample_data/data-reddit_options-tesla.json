     "If you have the buying power to short $TSLA you can flatten the delta on the call by selling shares. For example if the call is at 70 delta, sell 70 shares short. This gives you a position delta (shares plus option) of zero. If $TSLA keeps climbing, you'll still make money (the delta on the option will increase all the way to near 100) and if the stock tanks, you are covered by the short shares.\n\nYou kind of did this with the puts but right now you are heavily biased negative deltas. If you can't short shares (not enough BP) then reduce your put deltas (sell some of those puts) until you have roughly offset the current call delta.\n\nYou don't have to use ATM puts btw, so long as the deltas offset."

     "I don't really have much advice on the situation you are in. It seems like you are betting for a drop based on your 4 to 1 put to call ratio. I believe hedging is like 1 for 1.\n\nThis doesn't help now but...what you could have done which might not have been super exciting was:\n\n1. Sold a call against it. A 7/21 250c would have got you 12.60. That would have covered your initial cost and should you have held to 7/21 and Tesla stayed above 250, you would (in theory) collect another 2k. I say in theory because you would wanna close it at some point before the last day, etc etc. This would be a vertical spread. To be clear if all the above played out you would have earned 1,260 plus 2,000 so 3,260 on your 1,200 that you de-risked by selling the 250C.\n2. Sold a call with a different date. It would sort of be like a PMCC (poor man covered call) but usually the long call is much longer than a month. You could have sold a 6/16 250C for around 2.90. Hope that it didn't break 250 by 6/16 and sell another one for the week (6/23) later and collected some premiums while protecting your position. Just keep milking it. Should TSLA make a big run you could buy it back at  a loss. But this is a lot of work I think, constantly checking it (which I bet you were doing anyway).\n3. You could have just sold your 7/21 for 21.10  bought a 7/21 250C for 12.60. You would have de-risked. You would basically have a 7/21 250c for about 350 bucks. If things were going bad you know that as long as you got 3.50 for the 7/21 250c you were break even. Anything above that is gravy. Should Tesla for even higher you could have done a #1 and sold a call against it to lock some profit down the road and still be in the trade. \n\nI would have done number 1 or number 3.\n\nThe biggest issue is you had a plan (sell at 239) and then ignored it. I have done the same. Not judging you. Greed and fear kicked in and you decided to bet against Tesla with your puts.\n\nWhat you might want to do is close everything and take a profit. I am thinking you could still squeeze out some profit from all 5 (when added together basically your call is saving the day). Profit is profit and a win is a win. Theta is going to start eating your \\*\\*\\* on those puts.\n\nJust some thoughts. Not sure what the pros have to say. Good luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: spellling is difficult as is Capitilization and punctuation"

You also don't want to exercise when there is still time value on the options since it is better to sell the call option and buy the stock at current price.  But if you want to hold until expiration and want to have positive theta, you can turn it into a butterfly with a bullish bias.  One example is to sell two 16 June 2023 280 Call for 10.00 and buy one 16 June 2023 300 Call for 7.00 for a credit of 14.00.  This will have a positive theta and you can hold until expiration without having theta risk. You will however still be exposed to delta as this trade has a positive delta so you will lose money if TSLA retraces from the recent highs but that is also the case with your original trade (original trade even has more delta risk).  You can play around with the short strikes based on where you think TSLA will by by June 2023."

When selling a put you commit to buy 100 shares so make sure you have cash to cover it.

     "I\u2019m in the same position but I had been actively managing by rolling it up and out every week or so. So far, it\u2019s becoming a losing proposition as I now have my covered call expiring 6 months out at $240 strike.\n\nThe way I look at it is by considering the covered call as guaranteed income over time. If I roll out a covered call for minimal credit into next month, I consider this to be \u201cdividend\u201d or income at the same strike. If I roll it up and out, I will likely have to pay the difference but the jump in strike prices is also considered \u201cdeferred dividend\u201d.\n\nHere is an example using your expiration and strike:\n\nIf you roll out to the same strike to next month, you will receive an income of $190. Two months will give you $410 in income. Three months will give you $730 in income. Assuming these prices are accurate, the best bang for the buck is the 3 months as it guarantees you $240 a month.\n\nIf you want to roll up and out, you can pay now to guarantee slightly higher income. Next month, $5 strike higher ($190) would offer you $240 instead of $190. The next month, $5 strike higher ($195) would offer you $565 instead of $410. $5 strike higher ($200) would offer you $1,040 instead of $730.\n\nIf you are confident about where $TSLA price will be in the next six months, then be willing to pay upfront to guarantee income by that date. For example, I believe $TSLA will remain above $250 by January 2024. So I would pay $2,680 to guarantee me $3,800 in actual income or $630 a month.\n\nBut because you\u2019re paying upfront, you now have no leverage to use cash to get into more aggressive positions such as buying ATM or OTM call options for $TSLA.\n\nLet me know if this helps."

     "Your wording was confusing but I understand.\n\nBy writing a call you've effectively stopped yourself from gaining anymore money from your positions past the striek price of the call.\n\nYour options are:\n\n1) Roll it, probably the best if you own the stock theres no additional expiry to worry about just throw it far out and raise the strike price.  Robinhood has the option to roll single leg options, you can always do this but the roll option is simplified for beginners.  I.E. pick the roll option, pick an expiry further out and up the strike price.  Do it far out so your positive.\n\n2) If the strike is above your costs.  Just have it taken away.  Honestly, this here is what you should do if your already at a profit.  Chasing a higher profit will lead to more loss.  Just have it taken away than sell a put in hopes of getting it back later at a lower price. (look up wheel strategy)\n\n3) Close the position, it will cost you money.  You played the game and lost, you dont want to lose your stock and this is your last option to resolve it.  This is the worst option.  But sometimes neccessary, rarely.  Should only be done if you expect the underlying to continue to go up.  Your not likely going to make any more money than just having it called away.  IMHO your far to late to close it and it be reasonable.\n\nDont play with options unless your willing to **take the risk**, you wrote a call, you should have accepted that call was an acceptable amount of gain if it passed the strike.  Do not write any calls unless your willing to sell the stock at that strike price and forfeit any potential profits from it going much higher.\n\nDont learn options on stock that is valuable to you and you want to keep long term.\n\nPick something else and much cheaper, greeks will be different but basic principles are the same."

I.e. if the price stays roughly the same after a split, nothing will change from my perspective. Thinking to sell some options but since this is my first time, I'm wondering if there's something I'm missing here. Thanks for your input.\"",

It could profit modestly if it heads towards 230 or so, but if it pingpongs theta will kill this and by the time it actually hits 200 the option is not going to profit. good stocks don't stay down for long most of the time. if it pingpongs, you are not going to profit as big as a straight down to 185... \n\nIf you are confident a volatile stock could go down, don't buy put especially the long-dated ones. Go with short calls or short. When you short, you can pick how many shares you want to short. If you could short 50 x 250 = -12500, you could do something with that credit, and if you are right and it goes to 200, you still win 2500. No Greeks involved, because this just copies the move of the shares.\n\nOr if you truly want to do this, what you could do is also sell put against this to turn it into a pseudo-bullish move. \n\nEx: 200P for 12.50USD. Then you sell 230p weekly. You should still get decent premium on these as TSLA is-well-TSLA. If it goes above 230p you keep the premium and sell again. If it hits below 230, you roll."

Your ITM put can generate profits just by a potential IV crush.\n\nDisadvantage:- ITM puts have little extrinsic value to sell (even this one seems to have a lot compared to other instruments). Today the 1000 put costs 440 and has 85 extrinsic value, or a theta of 14.\n\n\\- You need to deploy a lot of capital. It seems inefficient for this extrinsic value.- Theta decay is inefficient ITM.\n\nSolution: If you sell slightly OTM puts, every month until Jan 2024, you probably get more value out of this, especially if you expect that the bottom is somewhere around 500.\n\nYou could also try to acquire 100 TSLA via assignment, somewhere around 450, and then start to sell ITM covered calls. That would allow TSLA to fall to maybe 350 and you're still not incurring a loss.\n\nShould TSLA fall below 300, we probably have other problems than what Tesla is doing. \ud83d\ude02"

By the way you asked this question, no disrespect intended, I\u2019m guessing that you\u2019re newer to selling premiums, and I would just say that pacing yourself and waiting to use margin until you\u2019ve found a consistent strategy that works for you personally, and once you\u2019ve been able to replicate this for months then consider margin but not before. \n\nThat said, you could consider dollar cost averaging (DCAing) into a TSLA position, at a set schedule over the course of the next few months until you have +100 shares to sell calls against, or perhaps use an ITM LEAPS contract to sell calls against, and regardless of how you get to your long position \u2014 run it with one contract before pushing in to sell large numbers. \n\nThe market conditions right now are not kind to going long on margin on anything, especially with tech. If you had to pick a time to push into some shares, id consider waiting til a retest of SPY lows at 380 and if it breaks downside then everything will be on sale. At the absolute minimum\u2026 wait for CPI data and FOMC. \n\nTesla contracts are not the easiest to manage, fluctuate a lot, and the underlying is prone to wild moves \u2014 if you are willing to practice with paper trading I think that is an excellent idea. If not, then starting smaller and *no margin* if you\u2019re learning how to run a strategy is the most helpful thing I can highlight within this entire reply. Practice makes perfect, and practice in the market costs tuition (your equity)."

Assuming the goal here is premium capture, it's possible there's another way.\n\n3/17/2023 is about 40 weeks away.  $110/40 = $2.75 / week.  Right now the weekly 15 delta call (6/10 765c) is selling for about $3.30, which totals 40*3.30 = $132 by 3/17/23.  This call can be hedged by buying 15 shares at $700 for $10,500.  \n\nAssuming no dynamic hedging (only holding the 15 shares through expiration), upside breakeven is about $810 or a +16% in one week. 810c is currently trading at 4.3 delta (or a 4.3% chance it hits that price in one week).  I'm ignoring the downside breakeven specifics b/c a bullish mentality obviously don't care about that scenario.  But at least 15 shares per lot is a metric fuckton less downside than 100 \ud83d\udc40.  \n\nAt 9 lots, the 15 delta hedge is 135 shares or only $94,500, which prevents any possibility of margin call scenario on the downside if starting cash balance is $350k.  Also, total premium captured for 9 lots over 40 weeks is $118,800, meaning if the stock trades sideways that whole time, the 135 shares would end up being \"free\", in fact a $24k profit for acquiring them.\n\nTrade obviously goes extremely wrong if the stock collapses and premium can't be collected each week.  Also obviously goes wrong if the stock spikes EVERY week and there's a loss on the 20 delta call every time.

There is no real reason to sell calls that far out in time, as many people have said you could run with shorter term calls and roll them constantly.  My preference is to start with selling a call around 20 delta in the next monthly cycle and then when it gets down to about 7-10 DTE I will roll out to the following month.  Occasionally my call will be breached and I'll need to adjust the strike for a debit but if I'm rolling up $10 and it costs me $6 that is still a win.  As a disclaimer, I am only doing this with ETFs, not single stocks.\n\nAs another option, why not sell a 20 delta put and roll that?  With 700k you could sell 10 x 20 delta TSLA Jul puts (595 strike) for about 23.20 credit.  So you take 23k in credit and as long as TSLA doesn't tank below 595 you're good.  For something like this I would roll to the next monthly at 21DTE give or take a few days.  As a disclaimer I would not trade at this size, or recommend doing so, in a single stock unless this position represented about 2-3% of my account (ie something along the lines of a $20,000,000 account)."

You would also have to pay short term capital gains tax this March on the $42.6k assuming no early assignment accompanied by a cost-basis offset sellback.\n\nBest case: stock rises above $1150 well before expiration, you buy-to-close for much less expensive cost, you keep the premium, and free up your collateral to use for something else.\n\nOk case: stock barely hits $1150 right at expiration, you are not obligated to buy the stock, the collateral that your broker has been making money off of for the last 26 months is returned to you, you still keep the premium.\n\nWorst case - and not even really that bad: TSLA slides below $1150 and stays there for 26 months and you are obligated to buy 100 shares of TSLA at your strike and baghold at whatever price it's at.\n\nNightmare fuel - TSLA goes bankrupt, you face early assignment, although you kept the premium, it's offset by the fact you own worthless shares, selling them back in an attempt to lower your cost basis for the year. You've lost $72.4k."

     "The cons are that it falls 80% and never recovers which could legitimately happen in 2 years if we're really in a bubble caused by a decade of asset inflation brought on by unprecedented \"quantitive easing\" performed by the federal reserve and when it tightens policy stocks fall similarly to how they did in 2000. \n\nThe other con is that if you're really so bullish you could make more than 37% by just holding the stock that you buy via specific entry point analysis or even discount averaging and make better returns on your money. \n\nIf it falls to an extreme point on an extreme put you sold and you get assigned there's absolutely no guarantee that whatever extreme scenario that is occurring doesn't cost it to fall twice as far or whatever. \n\nJust because it seems impossible now doesn't mean at all that the risk is as low as you think it is. \n\nIf you're truly \"fine\" holding tesla at any price then I guess there's zero downside for you and you should just jump in. \n\n\nThe pros are you get 37% return over roughly two years. \n\nHowever if you could make more than an annualized return of 18% or so then this isn't even worth it anyway and it just locks up your money for no reason.\n\n\nThe biggest problem with selling calls or puts is that it's always collecting pennies in front of a bulldozer. You may not realize it but the bulldozer exists whether you see it or not. \n\nNothing is free in this life. Absolutely nothing. Nothing ever will be. The moment you start thinking there is free money out there especially on wallstreet is the moment you become a sucker that makes someone else rich. \n\n\nEven if money is free because the fed inflates assets to infinity then you would've potentially Locked up money that could've kept up with asset inflation and instead locked it at 37% which may not even be enough to keep up with real  inflation over the next two years notice I said real. \n\nSo even in the scenario where the USD literally becomes free it's not free money. \n\n\nIt will be very far from free money. Tesla could be below 700 next week next month or next year. It could also go to 3000 next year if they release full self driving to all customers and create robo taxis and semis bla bla bla and you'll still have earned less on your money than if you'd done something else. \n\nEverything you're doing has opportunity cost.\n\nThat means nothing is ever free"

Read the prospectus, it walks you through this stuff: https://www.axsinvestments.com/download/582/tslq/6682/summary-prospectus-18.pdf\n\nThe options are not cheaper. The notional value is different.

Now an ATM put is priced the same as far OTM regular TSLA calls. One could scale out far more effectively and safely with these if it the liquidity increases. It essentially opens up a new avenue for traders who may have been previously priced out of trading TSLA options directly. \n\nI\u2019ll definitely be watching this and possibly adding to the liquidity pool if the opportunity presents itself. \n\nThanks for bringing to my attention."

Because of this they closed the position to avoid being assigned the shares.\n\nIf you had $18,500 in free cash available in your account then they should not have closed you out.  Since an IRA does not have margin LOANS available, and you are usually limited to the amount of cash you can deposit, this may have caused them to use more caution by closing.\n\nIn summary, you only needed $500 to open the spread, but could have easily required $18,500 to buy the 100 shares.

The only way you'll be profitable in this is if Tesla is BELOW 730 - 250 = 480. That is your BREAK EVEN point. So that means that in order for you to make any money on this it'll have to get BELOW 480. Since you paid 250 for it, it has to go 250 below 480 (480 - 250 = 230) for you to make 100% on your bet. \n\nSo hell no you shouldn't do this. \n\nOh and 4, even if you think Tesla is too high its hard to be against a company that is going to be growing at 50% per year. IT is pretty high but it could stagnate over 500 for 2-3 years and still be fine and you'd be fucked for 25K. \n\nThis is such a bad trade. \n\nWhen I trade options, I try to make sure I will make 100% super easy! I think this is the opposite of that.\n\nIf you think Tesla is overvalued then wait for a topping signal and look for a shorter term put, but the premium will still be very high. Just make sure that you'll be profitable at a support level if you want to do that. which may end up being 750 lol."

     "Other replies have addressed the mechanical reasons why infinite rolling will eventually hit a wall. I'd like to address the mindset problem.\n\nBeing an average, humble trader that just wants a decent trade \"once and a while,\" doesn't require optimizing the hell out of every trade. But \"doesn't require\" isn't the same thing as \"blindly ignore,\" let alone \"intentionally make bad decisions.\"  Focusing on the outcome of a single trade is a very bad habit for any trader. It can lead to [results-oriented thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/) as well as [loss aversion bias](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/content/loss-aversion-bias) and chasing profits at any cost.\n\nSo my problem with the idea of rolling that one trade until it finally wins is that it misses the forest for the trees. A better mindset is to be indifferent to the outcome of a single trade and focus more on your average results over many trades. Over 100 would be good. Over 1000 would be better. Over 10,000 would be great. Averages are what matter. Averages are how you converge on the expected value you planned for and targeted. Averages are what separate profitable traders from one-hit wonders."

However when the decline continued to 7 it would have been hard to impossible to stay at a credit. \n\nThere is also tying up capital both money and mental energy.

Keep in mind that provided the stock is above the strike price the trade will start to profit at some point.  There should be no rush to roll if the option is not ATM or ITM.  With TSLA around $172 your Apr 150 put is not at risk right now.  You don't include the credit you got, but calculating the breakeven price including that credit will find the BEP somewhere around $145.  \n\nThe other thing is that rolling can be very helpful but can also move the trade out in time to keep it open longer that can reduce the profit per day.  I prefer trades that do not get challenged and just close for a 50% profit, so I like to get out of these problem trades as soon as possible and not let them hang around too long.  \n\nYou opened this trade around the 45 dte so it might not profit until opened for 10 or more days.  Be patient and it is possible to mess up what would be a good profitable trade by adjusting too soon rather than let it work . . ."

China announced a form of Covid that breaks through the vaccine BA.115 . 43% now in new US cases - here already - flush the toilets again . It\u2019s all perception- perception right now and for the most of 2023 is one of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Inflation , terminal rate  and for how long - margin and demand destruction , slumping retail and consumer, rising personal and national debt, exit multiple and terminal values , Ukraine , oil and energy it\u2019s endless. For this to turn gamma positive and accent to the upside , all of the aforementioned must subside significantly. \n\nIt\u2019s all about perception \n\nIt's all about bucks, kid.

Implied volatility in the big ETFs can sometimes have a hard time pricing two-way movement like last week. The indices were practically unchanged on the week but were seeing intraday moves larger than what options were pricing for the entire week. The VIX collapsed on Friday on that rally but it certainly wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. In other words, if one is trading pure IV out a month or more those changes in VIX are tradeable.

I think it may get a small bounce tomorrow and give a good entry.  It sure has nice premium in the options and if it settles down and trades sideways a seller of this premium would be in great shape. I see the premium quite low on MTN options as this stock did not really sell off and earnings are coming up. Trades at quite a multiple for a company that is really not growth. High institutional ownership and may be part of the re.balancing we are seeing of late. When all the funds own the same name and join together to bid it up. How will it work if they all want out at the same time. May sell off on a good or bad earnings report imo."

With that, option volatility, as measured by the VIX settled near 20 to close the week.\\n\\nAt the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **1.5%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $388 to the downside and $400 on the upside. Here's how that 1.5% expected move compares to this week's expected moves in QQQ and IWM:\\n\\n**QQQ 2.6%IWM 2.4%**\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the VIX closed lower on the week, near 20 Friday. Again, that wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. If one is trading pure IV out a month or more being short vol would have worked, but if one was trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... the VIX or individual stock IV is less important if the stock makes a large one-way move higher.\\n\\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** made a big move higher, helping to take the indices t\"",

There is a TSLA report on Q4 22 sales due out Jan 4. The smart money says they miss the analysts number by at least 15,000 cars . Not good . The bank has a margin on TSLA 13 billion dollar loan to fund TWTR - the lower TSLA goes the more stock gets sold on margin . I just read the Shanghai plant is closed. \n\nTSLA earnings comes out Jan 25 th . They will probably scrape by on top and bottom line. All eyes will be on the guidance . What can Musk say positive ? A share buyback . Musk is a cagey shrewd businessman. He might want to deflate shares making a buyback cheaper , and calling in more shares. A reverse dilution makes his shares worth more - less in the market to buy . Driving the price up could be a result of that . Of course TSLA in its present state might not have the free cash flow to buy back 10-15 billion right now . They didn\u2019t have it to buy TWTR . \n\nTheir brand is wrecked right now , Musk is distracted with TWTR. No one is flying the TSLA plane it\u2019s on autopilot. \n\nYour problem is : \n\n(1) As soon as the stock significantly rises on an announcement the holder of the long put will sell  . That will lead to an assignment . \n\n(2) As of closing you are -103.00 per share in the red , the difference between your strike and the price . Each option you sold is - 10,300 at present . If you only secured the put with 10,000 - the exchange house will sell off 300 from your equity account - at that point they may close you out of the trade as your debit exceeded the CCP. Or , you can give them more money and hope that TSLA will go back up - but what if it dips to 90? Another 30 points is about 3000 per option more of your money gone. \n\nChances are as soon as the stock goes up 5-10 points you will be assigned and lose between 9000-10000 per option written"

If we do resolve this chop to the upside, I think there's a good chance we see tsla take off. the chips and AI plays are extended, aapl is aapl, the remaining high beta megacap that's acting as safe haven from the regional bank crisis that hasn't left the station are tsla and amzn. Last week, it formed a consolidation range around the 20d MA, which I will use as my risk. If it goes up, you have both delta and IV working for you going into earnings, but I'd probably take profit on most into earnings, and perhaps sell some higher strike contracts if I do end up holding into earnings.\n\nI also think it's a mistake to look at open interest in that manner. you don't know whether those are bought or sold, part of a spread, covered call or hedge against a short. it's a roadmap to nowhere."

     "I'm new-ish to options, so I tried running a straddle scenario through the numbers last night for Tesla's earnings day. My conclusion was that it would take an out-of-the-ordinary move in response to the earnings report to make a straddle likely to profit. All data, unless otherwise noted, was taken from E-Trade around 23:00hrs Eastern last night. Here's my math:\n\n* Price at close on 23 Jan  = $144.75\n* Max earnings move in last 6 quarters was 12% ($17.37 if closing price on 23Jan is used)\n* The premium for a $145 strike contract (1 put and 1 call) was $13.65 (or 9.43% of the close price of 23Jan) ... but I didn't note down when the contract expiration was for this. If I had to guess, I think it was the next monthly.\n* The underlying price would have to move above $158.40 or below $131.10 to be ITM\n\nGiven the premium would require a move over 9% to be ITM, and the largest recent earnings moves were 12%, this was unlikely to be a winning play.\n\nIf there was more information available, maybe one would have more confidence in the move. TSLA being a volatile mess, I don't have the funds to risk just based on the above.\n\n... this is where someone points out my simple math mistakes, probably."

Obviously I dont have all the data in front of me and I only have the observed data, but I can infer that essentially Tesla every few months will undergone an infinity call gamma squeeze that will keep pumping the stock up. Theres been some talk on Twitter about this if you just like search TSLA gamma, squeeze, etc. so Im not the only one to observe this. \\n\\nIf you are familiar with the famous Volkswagen squeeze, its similar, but the key difference is instead of it being a short term squeeze, this one seems to be a more drawn out squeeze that occurs every few months. So the reason its notable is that Tesla holds some interesting characteristics. First, its call skew in options sometimes is MUCH HIGHER than its put skew. This is unique. Very rarely do you see companies where the call skew is much higher than its put skew. Option demand is usually on the downside for protection for big fun'",

     ">Someone starts by buying way OTM calls > force market makers to buy stock to hedge calls initially,\n\nSomeone please explain this to me. Recently, an option course I took with TDAmeritrade has a multi-choice quiz question that  asks about the roles of market makers. One choice given is \"to take the other side of the option trades\" and another choice given is \"to match buyers with sellers.\"  It says the former is incorrect and the latter is correct. I had to re-take the entire 30-question quiz in order to achieve my 100% score because I got that question wrong. It ingrains in me that market makers do not have to take the opposite side of options trades. \n\nSeriously, if EVERYONE on earth wants to buy OTM calls and nobody wants to be the seller, can those calls still be purchased?"

Even if your hypothesis isn\u2019t correct, it\u2019s posts like this that help the community and why I love having a forum to share ideas.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what are your positions here (and otherwise)?\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking recently about the wave of attention towards SPACs and wondering if we\u2019ll see a delta hedge / gamma squeeze on SHLL in July even though the merger isn\u2019t until Sept/Oct. SHLL seems to be the consensus high-upside SPAC across r/SPACs and WSB and the options chain just got listed on Thursday so it\u2019ll only garner more interest short-term. More brokers will add SHLL to platform and options volume will pick up. We saw unusual call volume on SHLL on Thursday for the October strikes even through the market hasn\u2019t had much time to figure out the market price for calls. It\u2019s also possible that a headwind was cleared on Nikola on Thursday, given the warrant lock-up cleared 7/3, so shares staying flat or going up should further help SHLL. It seems very likely MMs will need to delta hedge SHLL options by buying shares in large volume very soon; combined with increasing retail interest I could see this only picking up more. I only own a small amount of warrants but I\u2019m very interested in this short/medium term mostly because of the fact that options on SPACs seem to be nonexistent until DKNG/NKLA/FMCI and I\u2019m wondering if hype + added chain will cause this to pop quickly even though the merger isn\u2019t until late Q3. I could certainly be overestimating the ability for this to run pre-merger, or the impact that added options have on price, but interested in this one."

I got a lot of questions on that post and wanted to go into a bit more detail about what it all means and what comes next.\\n\\nRefresher TLDR: A ton of retail flow is buying upside calls in high flying stocks and that creates short gamma for the sell side/ market makers. As the stocks go higher more and more stock needs to be bought to cover for the increasing short deltas created by that short gamma.\\n\\nGME was a hilarious example on Friday as it ran out of strikes on Friday's expiration and the MM's had essentially covered their short gamma for that day and the stock topped out and pulled back after that happened.

     "Not trying to hate since your posts are really helpful, but your Tesla example is due to it having earnings this week, which pushes up OTM call skew. Basically, people think if it moves this week (which it will), you will see a jump type of move as it\u2019s unlikely to be like a 2-3% type of move where that 850-900 call spread looks good.\n\nThat\u2019s why you end up seeing some things like the 850-900 costing the same as just the 900 due to jump risk. But with that said, I actually think the (put or call) spreads are better for this particular earnings."

There is a lot you NEED to understand fully to become profitable,that takes practice, patience, tolerance, and STUDYING. There\u2019s a lot of nuance to options trading, it\u2019s not so black and white. Can you tell me what the delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho mean? What they show? Can you understand implied volatility, and how volatility can effect your options? These are just very, very basic questions you should be able to answer before you start trading options. \nYou should be focused on trading stock and profit from that consistently before moving onto options. DO NOT LISTEN to YOLO retards, .01% of them actually profit, the rest are forever posting loss porn. You need to learn basic TA and basic options TA.\nThere\u2019s a way to make that 15k back, just study and be patient. Don\u2019t touch options until you\u2019ve learned how to understand them."

Don\u2019t try to make it back quick or you\u2019re most likely going to incur more losses. Use this boring trading style to study where you went wrong. If it was directional bets, learn more about the Greeks and how to exploit their variables to your advantage. \n\nHang in there, psychological toughness and emotional control are necessities for the market and like anything- they don\u2019t come easy. The fresh pain your feeling is usually part of that process of developing them. \n\nThe most important takeaway should be there is more to life than money, and that you have your whole life ahead of you.

     "Cut back on position sizes immensely (trade no more than $500-1000 at a time), trade only SPY/SPX or QQQ, and trade only during distribution phases or market moving events.\n\nFor example, we have spent about 3 weeks in an accumulation phase across the major indices, so it is very hard to play directionally. We are likely to come out of it soon as we move into earnings season, so there is probably going to be a good setup for a 2-3 week play. There is also an argument to be made for taking a month-long strangle and trying for a multiple hundred %er on the winning leg if we rally or plummet. \n\nYou can also just play the big days like CPI. If you took a 0dte strangle at open on the last 3 you would have made several hundred percent by close. \n\nMy point is you can't just fire off randomly at any old stock cuz you'll get your ass kicked since the liquidity is worse (meaning the bid-ask spread is worse) and you are more susceptible to unpredictable news events. Play the major indices (SPY and QQQ) and play the major levels. We are holding 3600 on SPX for a reason, hence the mega rally on CPI last Thursday"

Even though I tripled my account, I simply was not ready and on the level of someone who makes $$ consistently like that. It will be very wise to take a break and figure out what you want out of trading. Since I blew up badly, I\u2019ve put in tremendous amount of work and tried different types of trading without risking money (scalp, day, swing) and I found what I liked and implemented a strategy from how I view the market. I would advise not risking $$ until you\u2019re okay with seeing the market move a crazy amount and u not be apart of it. FOMO comes in many forms and controlling it is so key. Also if you haven\u2019t read trading in the zone then I wouldn\u2019t risk money until you do. Understand what you want from the market!

You have 15 grand in savings still.  Don't be depressed about it, you fucked up with stocks and thats a lesson learned.  You will 100% make it through this.  It's not somthing to freak out over just to learn from.  \n\n\nFurther advice:  Simply stop with the market.  It's too tempting to stay in and \"recover\" what was lost but in reality that was a loss you will never recover.  Even if you turn that 15 into 30, that original 15k is gone for ever.  Come to terms with it and make money the traditional way of college students for a year or two.  as you already considered above.  \n\n\nI've seen far farrr too many people in stocks ruin their lives over it, even kill themselves.  My brother has struggled with massive anxiety about it and it controls him, his mood is tied to it, it's an addiction imo.  \n\n\nDon't play around in stocks until you have enough money in life that you're perfectly safe losing 100% of that money.  The stock market is ALWAYS a gamble.  Don't pretend to yourself that you will be able to be safe if something goes wrong or somehow intelligently manage it.  \n\n\nAs I said, this is certainly NOT the end of the world, you could have zero life savings as most individuals our age do, and therefore you're already ahead.  Take the lesson, pull a lot of that money out of stocks if not all of it, and focus on college.  I hope this helps :)  \n\n\nNote:  Your well being is far more valuable than 15k dollars that are already gone (or any amount of money).  Stop focusing on the money and focus on other forms of fulfillment for a few months"

Also you know, you can analyze your overall portfolio and match your risk tolerance. Again, believe me or not, it is always better to have a consistent +5-7% average instead of potential +20% if you went all in on SPY if swings +20% and -20% hurts your psychological state it is way safer to combine SPY with bonds right? Simplest strategy ever, wanna less volatility - increase bonds, boom.  \n\n\nSurely you should not treat it as investment advice as I'm not an advisor at all. I worked with an advisor and then stopped cuz I found out that I can find the same info on youtube and basically make the same portfolio. But at least pick the basic idea - you don't do \"all in\". You must have like 80,90 or even 95 of your portfolio invested into ETFs for a very long run. And that portfolio consists of US/nonUS ETFs for Stocks/Fixed Income. So basically 4 pieces, US ETF, US Fixed Income ETF, nonUS ETF, nonUS Fixed Income. And the % of fixed income regulates the volatility - that should match your risk tolerance. And after you settle this one you may try to experiment with 5-10% of your portfolio as a sandbox, here you can go all in but you must select this % for the sandbox based on your psychology, and how much money you can lose without breaking down mentally.  \n\n\nBtw, my portfolio is about -20% from the inception. I have a realized loss of 1k thanks to best ever strategy \"buy high, sell low\" though I sold in the mid of the China ETF fall, at 40$ (right now it is 8$ or so). Also lost some on esports ETF bet. Also, have an unrealized loss of 1k on AMD bet."

Unless you have ridiculously bad positions and you\u2019re trying to play options trading, if you\u2019re hoping to hold on for the long haul, just stop looking at it.

You must give your stocks time to grow and patiently sell calls or puts (a wheel strategy - the wheel strategy can easily get you a 30%-40% annual return).\n\nIf you want to be more aggressive, you can put a portion of your portfolio into SPXL ETF. It is a 3x leveraged ETF that goes up or down three times faster than the market. You can also accumulate 100 shares and sell covered calls against it. It also pays a dividend. Now is a good time to start buying. You can choose to dedicate, let's say, $5000 to this ETF, and when the market reverses, trim the gains (e.g., the amount goes to $7,000, so you trim $2,000 and save it, when the ETF amount drops to $3,000, for example, buy back shares to rais the holdings back to $5,000, and so on. But be prepared for large drawdowns as well as upsides with this ETF. If you are not ready for it, stay away).\n\nDon't bail out. You have time on your side. Do not engage in risky trades because you want to get rich quickly because you read about some lucky guys who turned their $1,000 into millions. There may be a few guys lucky to achieve it, but most people fail. It is a lottery ticket, not investing. Also, remember, trading works well if you have millions to trade. With $30k, you must be careful, or you wipe your account out fast."

The fact is, any high reward endeavor comes with high risk, and with such an endeavor, there is a price to pay, i.e., a tuition fee.   \n\n\nHere are three tips:   \n1) Treat trading as a business (read Mind Over Markets by James Dalton, specifically, \"A Business Strategy\" in Chapter 5);   \n2) Watch \"Trading as a way of life\" TED talk by Jihan Bowes Little ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7WgRtLbx4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7WgRtLbx4k)); and  \n3) Reflect on why you want to trade, your strengths, and your weaknesses, and answer the following question honestly: \"Do you have what it takes to trade?\"   \n\n\nIf you have given trading 100%, and now is not the right time for you to continue, then that's ok, accept it, move on, and put your time and energy into something that isn't so emotionally taxing for you."

     "I did the same thing at your age. My risk management was abysmal. I've been trying for the last 10 years and still cannot be consistently profitable in trading. But, my losses are small now at least. I did a stocktake of my trades and basically about 80% of my losses were from \"Yolo\" trades where I pretty much expected to make big, so I risked big. Never eventuated and I was left holding the bag! \n\nMy advice is, find high quality data from tick data suite (I got 10-20 years for 5 pairs on a free trial), and learn to code on mql5. Create robots so that trade execution psychology isn't necessary. Learn data analysis techniques so you can scientifically find opportunities in price data. This will allow you to see what works and what doesn't in the most reliable way possible.  Godspeed!"

If not, then you NEED ONE.  If you have a trade plan and still lost, then you need to review and update it.  Trading without a plan is pure gambling and leaves you open to making rash emotional decisions that can lead to losses.\n\nDid you put too much of your account at risk?  Keeping risk to 5% per stock or position is one way to lower the risk.  Keeping 50% of your account in cash will usually help you get out of trouble if you get into it.  \n\nFigure out what went wrong and how you can avoid having it happen again will make you a much better trader.  \n\nIf you do start again use a simple and high win rate strategy such as a covered call on a solid high quality stock.  Even AAPL is down, but I think we can all agree it will not stay down forever.

Now I have been buying more shares on Tesla below $560 little nibble $520 & below I bought probably to much oh well I\u2019m a long time investor with Tsla. I buy the $1700 leaps every time it goes below $550 & sell them on the next big move over $600 for a good profit. I would buy Tesla shares & get up to your first 100 & start selling calls or puts. I make a great passive income on doing this I only sell weekly calls & lately I can do it 2 times a week of course buying my shares back but pennies on the dollar. But there are tons of much better trades than this. I highly recommend you don\u2019t personally.

Either when Elon announces the CEO of Twitter or the location of the next gigafactory Mexico, its off to the races, and if neither of those things happen its still about to happen. The company is not currently going bankrupt so its going to bounce, hard, before it continues its much deserved decline to reasonable levels. This is just market science, Im surprised its been allowed to go this far. I tracked back the other day. On a five year chart Tesla has only been this oversold one other time.

Back in Jan I rolled it to 130 strike(back when stock was $108) with expire in April. Well, Tesla has popped huge. So I have a few choices I see to do here: oh, and my avg purchase price for the shares was $350 so there is a loss there.  \\n\\nI've made cash rolling this option so far of about $3k\\n\\n1. Hold the option awhile longer and see how it goes. Premium is high enough no one may execute it.\\n2. Roll the option out to June up to $140 strike that would cost me about $500. Although it would result in an extra $500 gain on those shares if it executed. Rolling it however results in a $8k or so paper loss. Which may not matter since later I see if the stock falls and it becomes a gain at some point.\\n3. Roll the option out 3 months to get more cash out and raise strike.\\n4. Hold another month and roll in March.\\n\\nI've only been trading options like this for 2 years and overall have made m\"",

Now the challenge is to figure out what they were buying and selling. One way to approach this is to look at the side of the quote the order printed on, with the assumption being that bidside trades are seller-initiated, and askside trades are buyer-initiated. This is a variation of the Lee-Ready quote rule cited in their 1991 paper. Applying this model, it looks like the trader bought the Oct 230c, sold the Nov 230c, and the other 2 legs are unclear as midmkt prints. One approach to classify the midmkt trades is to compare the prices to the theo value (we source ours from [ftoptions.com](https://ftoptions.com) in Chicago, they do a very good market-maker style dynamic fit), assuming trades above theo are buyer-initiated and below theo are seller-initiated. That would suggest the Oct 265 calls were bought and the Nov 280 calls were bought (that part CNBC got right). So now the picture looks like a buyer of the Oct 230/265 call spread for $26.69, and seller of the Nov 230/280 call spread for $26.79 - a net dime credit. Using the same theos to calculate the price of this as a single package gives a value of a few cents, which means the fill was near value. There are a few more ways to confirm this- open interest changes for the following day:\n\n|usymbol|expiry|strike|putcall|openint|oichg|date|close|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TSLA|10/18/2019|230|C|5174|\\-5203|10/16/2019|$29.80|\n|TSLA|10/18/2019|265|C|5972|\\-4874|10/16/2019|$1.10|\n|TSLA|11/15/2019|230|C|14196|6036|10/16/2019|$35.13|\n|TSLA|11/15/2019|280|C|7446|4042|10/16/2019|$7.28|\n\nThis confirms the Oct contracts were closing, while the Novembers were opening, and also there is an exchange feed from the ISE that identifies customer buying and selling for each contract. Looking at that we get the final confirmation\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Oct 230.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5459|\\--|100%|\\--|\\--|\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Oct 265.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|6143|1%|1%|1%|90%|\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Nov 230.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5450|\\--|\\--|100%||\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Nov 280.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5901|92%|\\--|\\--|\\--|\n\nThis shows (for ISE volume only, but fortunately this flow was nearly all on the ISE) the customer was buying the Oct spread to close, and selling the Nov spread to open (which was confirmed by the open interest changes). I actually found the origin of the Oct spread, sold in mid September near $17 with shares near $245.\n\n||||||||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|500|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.90|(FT Theo=$18.08)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|10:58:34 AM|\n|500|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$18.15|(FT Theo=$18.43)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|10:57:11 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.00|(FT Theo=$17.00)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|11:02:48 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$16.89)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|11:02:42 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$16.90)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|11:02:33 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$17.02)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|11:02:08 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.00|(FT Theo=$17.02)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|11:02:06 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$16.93)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|11:02:01 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.00|(FT Theo=$17.02)\u00a0\u00a0BID\u00a0\u00a0ISE|11:01:32 AM|\n\nSo the overall picture looks pretty clear now- On Oct 15th this trader closed a short call spread for a loss, and sold a new Nov 230/280 call spread to open for little out-of-pocket cost.  The point of this is to (hopefully) see shares return to lower levels when they can exit the spread for a lower price. They did get long 6K of the Nov 280 calls- but only as the long leg of the short call spread, which is now $20 deep and trading near $45. The profit figures being tossed around on the long Nov 280s (up $18 \\* 6K = 10.8M) are offset by the larger loss on the short Nov 230 calls (-$35 \\*6K = -21M), which nets out to a hit near $10M on this trade. It is certainly possibly the seller is long Tesla common stock and was using these call spread sales as an income generator - if so the sting is not so bad, but the initial in-the-money strike price of 230 would be an odd choice for a long-term holder."

In addition, JPow is talking today at 2:30PM EST, likely IV will drop after that.  SPY is pretty likely to go up, but with IV down you could easily see your calls drop in value even if SPY does go up.  Basically holding is taking a gamble... I'd recommend taking at least some profits before JPow speaks.  Whatever you hold afterwards, if we get up to 450 and don't break through I'd say sell then because we're likely to turn downwards again.\n\nTSLA has been following SPY pretty closely lately and your TSLA calls are in a similar spot."

I dont trade it and so don't know that landscape at all. \n\nBut you will still bleed out unless you get a pop. What are the odds of a pop? A pop to the extent that you need it? At what level rise or fall do you close out?\n\nYou could sell 4 higher strike calls and make it into some sort of back ratio.

But do not even think to hold after earnings, the burn after earnings will be bad that it will leave a scar. TLDR, Wait a couple more days and get our in profit, don\u2019t be into earnings.

TSMC and ASML should be safe long term picks in general since both are basically 'required' for the semiconductor industry to work as TSMC is basically a duopoly (with Samsung), while ASML is pretty much a monopoly. \n\nIntel and AMD may potentially have movement later this month when Intel's new CEO is supposed to talk about Intel's future. QCOM will likely rebound after it plummeted on bad earnings which really wasn't all that bad aside from the shortage issues everyone else is also facing.\n\nAs for the semiconductor shortage, any near term big price movement is basically banking on Biden's words. The administration says they will address supply chain issues in the 'coming weeks', semi conductors included with that. But regardless of what they say it won't 'fix' the issues right away, but could offer certain (or all) companies monetary incentives. Nobody knows what he will say/do, so it's up in the air what companies actually benefit the most from it. Could always just buy calls on a semiconductor ETF."

You could also sell nearby calls and \"lock in\" your gains, but at that point, you may as well monetize your calls. You said you basically want to roll your calls higher (pocket gains now and spend some on a new bullish call trade) so this may be the best course."

It\u2019s up to the broker and their policies around this.\n\nThat being said you should have lost less than what you paid since, presumably, there was still some extrinsic value left when they closed it.

Just make sure the underlying LEAPS call has a delta higher than 0.7 and that the debut payed is less than 75% the difference in strikes. Telsa is also probably to expensive for this though.\nIf you really want to play Tesla than you can do spreads since they have defined risk, just don't get greedy and hold till they expire. If IV Rank is over 50% do a credit spread, if it's under do a debit spread. With the drop yesterday and today its probably over."

It has been dropping $50 daily.  Pltr if anything is likely lower. Play puts requires lots of luck. Not recommended unless all stocks crash(>-30%)-unlikely.\n\nKeep your 1200 Euros.

Here was [the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gij559/higher_probability_trading_in_high_dollar_stocks/).\\n\\nOne of the things you often hear traders talk about (and it's even discussed in the comments on that post) is when doing a multi-leg trade, if the move happens too quickly, sometimes you wish you had just done something more 'simple'.\\n\\nIn this case TSLA hit the target of $1000 a month 'too soon'. I revisited these trades today and to compare how they performed vs eachother.\\n\\nBut more importantly, I wanted to show how I manage a vertical spread when it's gone ITM and hit its target with alot of time to go til expiration. I'm not sure a ton of people understand that flip... from going long premium with decay *against* you... to long premium and decay *with* you.\\n\\nIt's a cool\"",

Because when you're that deep in the money, it's almost like you own the stock. If the stock goes up a dollar, your call should go up by almost a dollar. On the 1000 call, there's still a risk that the call doesn't hit, so the delta is much lower, therefore it goes up less per dollar."

If it's at or below the price after the date it'll expire and disappear the next day (usually Saturday). If above, you sell the stock at the strike price.\n\nYou can buy to close if the price is close to the strike right before market close on the expiration date for less than you received.\n\nBut be aware that you can only do this during market hours (4pm eastern) but there are after hours until 8pm where the price could go past your strike.\n\nAlso, if you want to sell at a generally safe price, choose a Delta around .3. On E-Trade you have to select \"Greeks\" from the drop down and select \"search\" to see the Delta."

Rake off half a percent a week for 26% a year. If your option will exercise on Friday close it out and sell a new one for the following week a few points higher. You never have to lose your stock. Generally this will work 48 weeks a year and maybe 4 times you buy back the call. Do it every Monday. Do not go longer than a week. The returns will likely beat most managed funds."

Then pick the expiration date of the option and the strike price you would be willing to sell your shares at.   I would then recommend using a limit order *(somewhere between the bid and ask)* to determine the premium you receive, rather than accepting the market price.  If you have enough shares the system automatically marks them as covered.  If you don't have enough shares *(or already have them in use as collateral for another CC)*, the system automatically checks to see if you have Options level 4 approval, and if not it will give  you an error and not let you sell the naked call. \n\nNow only do this if you are truly ready to sell the shares you have and are ok giving up future gains on the stock, while at the same time you don't need the money right away and are ok not getting to sell your shares at the current price.   I mention this because there are too many people out there who lament their decisions because they can't cope with the lost opportunity costs of their shares being sold and missing out on gains as the stock goes up, or not having their shares sell and missing the peak as the stock drops."

The only issue I have with it is the part about a covered strangle addressing the issues you enumerated.  \r  \n\r  \nA wheel typically starts off with a low delta short put.  If assigned, you write an ATM or OTM covered call so now it's a high(er) delta position.  A covered call is equivalent to a short put so in either case, effectively, you have a short put position.\r  \n\r  \nA covered strangle is equivalent to two short puts.  In terms of strategy, it's more premium in your pocket and you've dollar cost averaged (if assigned).  There's no magic here."

     "I think people would be much better off if they applied some sort of trend following strategy with The Wheel.  Most of the \"Help me! I sold a put on XYZ\" posts I see, I pull up the chart and the daily, weeklies, and monthlies look like a dog's breakfast.  They are trading below all major MAs, volume is piddly, and the chart is printing a series of lower highs and lower lows in succession.\n\nHonestly, I think the bare minimum to do the Wheel (assuming you are treating it like a short-term swing trade vs. a longer term strategy) is to trade it when a) price is above a medium term moving average like the 50 or 63 (quarterly) and made a new confirmed pivot high over it, over the quarterly Volume Profile Point of Control, the Weekly MACD is green and rising, etc.  Honestly, anything that shows that the medium term trend is steadily holding to rising...it can be whatever you want it to be but it has to show strength.\n\nSince the Wheel is generally a bullish strategy (the expectation is that the puts will never be assigned) you want price to keep making higher highs and higher lows.  Once it stops doing that, you shut it down and look for a ticker that is.  This is the reason so many people here and in /thetagang were so pro-Wheel for most of 2020-2021 is because the market just kept going higher. It was a viable strategy that was fairly easy to implement and most were holding for a few weeks and closing out for profits by selling a put at support, getting assigned or having it expire worthless, and then selling the shares at the clear resistance point.  \n\nPeople can still trade the Wheel if that is what they are comfortable doing, but pick stocks that are strong, like energy and basic materials, or mining, for example.  Don't trade $AMD, $TSLA, $NVDA, etc. because it has to turn around.  Sure, it probably will, but is that $1.00 in premium right now really worth 6-18 months of pain and torture until it does?  For most, I think not, based on the bi-weekly \"help!\" posts I see on a lot of options trading subs."

     "Stock analysis changes as stocks that passed your test last year, month, or week may not pass today.  With that said, good quality blue chip style stocks are generally a good place to be invested during a downturn.  Cash is also a good place based on your view of the market cycle.  \n\nIf the stock blows past the price you want to own it at and/or your analysis is that this stock is no longer one you want to own or hold, then close for a loss and move on.  If this is happening more than a couple of times a year then look at how you are analyzing and selecting stocks.  Too many traders trade these high risk stocks and then complain when they have to \"bag hold\" them.  \n\nFor example, I stopped trading TSLA some time back when Musk was doing odd things (smoking pot on video) as I recognized the stock was not driven by fundamental business factors like profits, and they weren't profitable for some time.  \n\nTSLA was always a *speculative play* and has a cult following which has no place when trading the wheel.  Should anyone be surprised that TSLA dropped like it did?  With all of the other EVs coming out will TSLA keep their cult status?  If someone wants to trade TSLA then do so with a small (5%) of the account as more of a gamble.  \n\nI'd give TSLA 5+ years to see if they settle and become a stable blue chip style stock before trading it, or expect the wild price swings to keep happening.  Part of what makes TSLA attractive is the high volatility that offers bigger premiums, which are an indication of its risk.  \n\nStocks with high premiums relative to their price should often be avoided as there are higher risk or the premiums would not be so high!  \n\nAAPL would be a better example.  It has dropped and many may be rolling or assigned shares, but I expect few would think this is not a good stock to hold, and maybe even add to their positions as risk and the account allows.  Many years ago AAPL was like TSLA and is now a blue chip style mature company with solid management worthy of trading and investing in.  \n\nPart of the wheel strategy is to be a shareholder when needed, and that is why each trader will want to trade stocks they would not mind holding through these down market times, which we all know will not last forever.   \n\nA covered strangle is a good strategy for those who have become assigned shares on a good stock provided they are prepared to buy more shares if the put is assigned and doing this does not make this or any stock too large of risk in an account."

It costs a lot of money to trade 100% collateral CSPs and CCs, if you are trading equities that cost $50/share or higher. I'm astounded at how many people Wheel SPY and QQQ! But if they can't afford $50/share or higher, that makes people trade shares with lower prices, and a lot of those companies are in bad shape or are new with no track record of consistent shareholder value. In other words, the high cost of the Wheel forces them into sub-standard equities."

Hopefully anywhere between $500 to $550 a share. \\n\\nAnd with that I am planning to sell 25%-30% OTM calls every week for premium. Should be apx $3000 to $5000 a week in premiums. If the stock goes past my strike, then I will lose out on some potential profit but I will be up a boat load on stock still.

If we go into recession next year, these rates could go even lower and then ZIM will have MUCH worse margins, and have depressed earnings. \n\nThe stock market is forward looking, a dividend yield is inherently backwards looking. There\u2019s no way ZIM will be able to maintain their dividend because they have massive headwinds with slowing economy. \n\nZIM could be a good long term investment, but those are the main reasons someone would sell this stock. Look at their profitability before 2020, they used to be a break even business at best, and now they have massive profits. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see them at break even again if the economy and demand for goods cools.

     "Solid list but I disagree with a few of them or at least think they need more nuance:\n\n>4. Make strike price high enough to be unlikely to be hit\n\nIf you're getting paid enough at a reasonable strike then there's no reason to be afraid of getting tested or having shared called away. If I can sell a CC at even $1 above my basis and net a decent premium I may be looking at a 5-6% ROI in a month. I'd happily get my shares called away especially if it barely passes my short call, that means I maximized my trade window\n\n>7. Shorter expirations can allow for collection of more premiums vs longer expirations (under 30 days)\n\nThis can be fine, but it also works against point #4. The closer I go to expiration the more likely I am to have my shares called away at a strike that appears too low. This often times leads people to trade far OTM for little premium so they don't get called away or trading too close then having to roll their way out of it because they just wanted high theta decay\n\n>9. Don\u2019t trade all of position (ex: 1 contract with 300 shares)\n\nThis can be fine if you want to layer trades or have an extra round left in the chamber, but I don't think it should be a hard rule. If you listen to your other points (i.e. sell at an amount you don't mind walking away from) then you can do a 3 lot on 300 shares without batting an eye\n\n>11. Buy to close at 75% of premium\n\nI completely agree on having a management level. 75% is a little rich for my blood unless I'm either really confident or playing for something like IV crush that may have just happened to coincide with earnings or an event. I like 50%, but as long as you're managing winners I think it's just individual preference. \n\nThat all said, I think it's great that you're building a framework so you have some mechanical process to make decisions that you can tweak as you learn more and develop a system."

It will help prevent you from having all your eggs in just one basket.  But at a minimum, if you do write calls on all the shares you own of a given stock, I'd suggest you ladder them out with different strikes and different expirations to help you better adjust and respond to various market ups and downs for the underlying."

That gives you a sweetspot for risk/reward and has been backtested on a variety of credit strategies.\n\nFor expiration, 45 DTE entry and roll at 15 DTE also has backtested well for a balanced risk/reward.

     "12- dont do covered calls. It is a terrible proposition, you end up selling low when the price is high or making nominal returns on a stagnant stock. After a while with low premiums on a stagnant stock everybody starts looking at more volatile names and moves further out to increase the premiums and when the stock you have been holding goes up you miss it, and lock up all the shares for weeks.\n\nI strongly suggest reading up on cash covered puts. It is a much safer way to generate revenue. You put up the cash, get a premium back, if the stock stays out of the money you get your cash back, if your put is in the money you get assigned. but as you have gotten the premium, you are buying at a discount, and hold or sell, up to you. using made up numbers - if share Z is $10 and I sell the $9 put and get $1.00 premium - I put up $900 but get $100 back = total spend $800. If Share Z drops to $8.50 and I get assigned, I only paid $800, and I can still sell the shares and come out $50.00 ahead. If it drops to $5.00 then I am holding 100 shares of Z at an unrealized loss, if it is a company you believe in, hold the shares until they come back up or sell them in a covered call.\n\nCovered Calls are pushed because they seem like easy money, but they are not, and the bank gets your shares for cheap when the price is high. Cash covered puts are much much more in your favor."

Again, just a quick in analyzed example, a 245 strike put will cost right around $7.\n\nLooking at the scenarios, if the stock moves up some but not over $300 then you keep $7, or $700 on profit.\n\nIf the stock moves up a lot above $300 then you can make $29, or $2,900.\n\nHowever, if you buy the put the amount it may go up in unknown, but the long put didn\u2019t cost you much, and maybe nothing at all."

It's hard to judge how profitable it is without knowing the price you paid.\n\nJust close the whole spread if you go over $560. You would have just won the lottery if that happens. Don't get greedy, you can always open a new trade with the profit.\n\nActually, there's an argument for legging out now and just covering the short leg while it is still OTM and relatively cheap.

Look at this trade as a spread only.  \n\nThe spread on the close was worth about 107, so you are up around 68 on the spread.\n\nThere are several things you could do here.  Sell the spread and take your profit.  If you are still bullish, you could \"roll up\" some.  For example, as a spread you could sell out your long 356 calls and buy the 460 calls.  If you did something like this you would then have the 460 / 560 call spread, and you would have taken sold the 356/460 out for 68.  So here you would lock in some of the profit.  \n\nIt depends on how aggressive you want to be and how much profit you want to take.\n\nYou could also just sell out some the spreads you have and hold the rest."

You already know you messed up but there are a few ways you can lower your losses.\n\n1) Sell  a put credit spread, the margin wont change since you already have the call credit on the other side. This can help you capture some of your losses. Dont go too close to the current price. You can effectively converting your call credit spread into iron condor.\n\n2) Pray TESLA goes down from here, which is possible since CPI report is coming out this week. Market might get hammered before or it might go up even higher in anticipation of a lower CPI. So its a 50/50\n\n3) You can roll your position further out to further expiry like Nov or Dec and go as far otm as you can. You have to take losses now but it increases your chance of profiting from it.\n\n4) Just take the L and learn a lesson. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither way there is  a lot to learn for you from this extremely risky trade.

This is my third 50% dip.  \n2017-2019, 2020, 2022. \n\nI think Macro plays a huge part. \nTSLA is down 25% this 3 months, and flat the last year. \nQQQ is down 16% and 14%\nAMZN is down 31% and 36%\nFB is down 12% and 45%\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of news about Elon this and Elon that.  It\u2019s is 90% noise. I ignore it and focus on the fundamentals. \n\nNegative catalysts. \nTesla Shanghai was shut down for 1.5 months. This will hurt Q2 financials. It\u2019s Teslas highest margin plant. Also the Fed will announce there is a recession on July 28th.  More Elon news will come out. \n\nPositive catalysts\nEvery automaker will sell every EV they make.  Tesla is planning on making the most and have a 1 year backlog on the model Y. I wish the news about Elon would have reduced my wait times it has not. My Feb order planned for Aug has been delayed to November. The delivery reports for tesla are planned for Jan 3rd, Apr 3rd, July 3rd, Oct 3rd.  So Jul 3rd will not be great.  I expect October to be good and Jan to be off the charts with Texas and Berlin to be ramped to 5k per week.  Also Tesla is announcing split. \n\nMy own strategy which is not financial advice. Wait for them to announce the recession on Jul 28. The Q2 financials and Q2 earnings have past. And then mid August buy calls.  \n\nI bought calls last year in June and rode the Q3 and Q4 deliveries and dumped them 800C 6/22. 80k calls sold for 400k. It was pretty sweet. When TSLA doubled the calls 5x. \n\nOf course this is gambling. And the majority of my holdings are in the stock which is investing. \n\nShort term PE is compressing. Long term EPS Cars*ASP 50k, 20% margins:\n2020 ~0 EPS (500k cars built)\n2021 $6 (930k)\n2022 $15 (1.5M: 600k, 800k, 50k, 50k)\n2023 $25 (2.5M: 600k, 1M, 450k, 450k)\n2024 $36 (3.6M: 600k, 1M, 1M, 1M)\nThese estimates are just based on the current factories. In 2024 Shanghai 2, Texas 2 and Berlin 2 Maybe producing cars. Shanghai they bought a second piece of land.  Texas and Berlin have room to expand. 40 PE 2023 = $1000, 40 PE 2024 is $1440. Or use your own PE.  \n\nHappy hunting"

Even after the split, a single call contract close to the money will set you back more than $4,000 (because right now it will set you back more than $20,000). And the call will be loaded with premium and subject to substantial time decay. If TSLA continues to run as it has recently, it will validate all of these high costs. But that is a big risk.\n\nFor expensive stocks like this traders often use Call Debit Spreads (same expiry) OR Put Credit Spreads (pretty close to the same bet) where cost is reduced to a fraction of a direct call but profits are capped.  (I am not recommending the spreads by the way in the case of TSLA, but it is the standard way of getting cash requirements way down for expensive stocks).\n\nKeep in mind that TSLA will still be at $400 per share plus after the split."

It has been tortuous all the way down because the upwards percentage rallies have actually EXCEEDED the total down bear movement, that is until last Friday. \n\nThe fact is, you already know the economy is in a mess and things look worse, not better. Given that's the case, the current down moves actually haven't been too bad because dip buyers got rewarded the whole way down since January and late put buyers got smashed despite this being a down market. \"Short covering rallies\" or however youd like to describe it. The bottom line is there will be a moment that there will NOT be short covering rallies and there will NOT be a relief rally, and that everyone trying to long a dead cat bounce will get smashed beyond smithereens. However, when is that moment? You will not know. February SPY puts is probably the safest way to play this although dollar cost averaging in will be smarter than all at once. I have no guarantees that tomorrow isn't \"the day\" but you have to go with statistics and just assume \"the day\" is later on and therefore DCA into your put plays is the smarter thing to do. I would DCA over a period of 2 weeks to a month so give yourself some breather, and please do Februaries."

This is a staggering number of picks to be made by one person! \\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\nWhile we can all argue about his expertise in making recommendations on such a wide array of industries and companies, what I wanted to know was:\\n\\n1. **How accurate were his recommendations?**\\n2. **Would you have made or lost money if you followed them?**\\n3. **Can you beat the market following his picks?**\\n\\nSo its high time that we put Cramer to the ultimate test and end the debate about his usefulness once and for all!\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xethcdd2fv981.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5b59dd0688a13e4ab449435131b7ab82074a89a4\\n\\n**Analysis**\\n\\nThe data about all the stock picks made by Cramer are available [here'",

You don\u2019t ever have to follow whatever he says, but there will always be a counterpart to your trade, and wouldn\u2019t you rather know the strategy of the other side?"

He consistently repeats that you should not be blindly buying all his picks, the show is a platform to hear lots of names and get ideas. 2.

     "\"with no chance of loss\"\n\nI have a better chance at getting laid than you have trading Covered Calls with no chance of loss. \n\nBut bruv, if you long 100 shares of Tesla at $810 and sell a contract for $2,300 your net outlay is going to be $78,700. Every point Tesla drops is -$100 so if Tesla drops 23 points then you are at your breakeven. If Tesla drops say 40 points for example you now have a loss of -$2,700 and seeing how Tesla can drop 400 points in a month shows there is significant downside risk. Sure you can buy back your short call and sell another call at a lower strike but you risk getting your shares called back below your basis cost. \n\nCovered calls are not a trading cheat code and they can be very dangerous if you play high volatility stocks like Tesla.

The most important is to understand that you don't buy a stock with the sole purpose of selling a covered call on it. You want to buy a stock that you would outright buy 100 shares of regardless, and then determine the optimal approach toward selling your call. \n\nFor instance, if you buy TSLA at $800, you want to research and answer the question of where you think it is going in the short term. Do you think it will rally throughout the next few weeks? Probably shouldn't sell a covered call. Do you think there is the possibility of a large negative catalyst that makes it see a significant (10%+) decline? Maybe consider just selling the stock. \n\n$2300 of premium is really nothing compared to TSLA's overall movement. That's only a 3% move afterall. If you believe TSLA will remain relatively flat or if you believe volatility is too high, then that may be a good time to sell a covered call, but you don't want to blindly sell covered calls just because you own 100 shares of something because in the long term it will never overtake the amount of money you are losing or missing out on from holding the underlying."

     "I'll share my story since I experienced the \"worst\" case scenario with this strategy. I too had this realization a couple weeks ago. The key is to choose a stock you truly believe in and wouldn't mind holding if you had to.\n\nI've always been a fan of Roku (not here to debate on stock picks lol). So instead of just buying the shares I opted to \"wheel in\" (see wheel strategy) by selling cash-secured put. So basically I collect premium, if the stock hits the strike I get assigned the shares for each contract. I sold 2, 1 @ $150 and $139. This was the week of Roku earnings...\n\nCome earnings Roku dumped, I got assigned 200 shares with the average price of $137 but Roku ended that week @ \\`$112-ish so I'm down a good chunk but it's not realized. I'm a little sad but I believe in Roku and this is the best part of this strategy, I haven't really lost, I can now sell Covered Calls, now granted it sucks because I need to sell above my average price and since I'm so far out the money the premium isn't great but I can still make something. Fast forward to now (just go look at the Roku charts). I'm back in the green, collecting the big premiums for the weekly Covered Calls, and I might get exercised which means I'll just repeat it all again.  \n\n\ntl;dr\n\nSold cash-secured puts on Roku, \"worst\" case scenario happened, Roku dumped. Got assigned 200 shares, sold covered calls, Roku recovered. I'm back in a perfect position. My only recommendation is don't buy the shares out-right. Sell cash-secured puts to get into them so you can take even more premium, double dip!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal Note: People say, \"but what if it blows up and you miss out on all the gains.\" Ignore them, they're not understanding your goals. I have a different account for my buy and holds to the moon. My goal with this account is to generate a monthly dollar amount and as long as I'm doing that. I'm winning."

The real world is far from ideal, using your TSLA example last week you would have had a range of 700 to 856, your 815 CC would have done fine.  Then you have this week where it looks like TSLA is having a face-ripping up move where you'd sell your CC but if this continues through the week it'll cost you more than that 2300 plus your initial 81,000 to buy back in.\n\nThere are no guarantees, an outsized move in either direction could ruin your plan.  I've seen mention of cash secured puts which is a good plan, just sell puts at the price you'd like to buy at until you are a proud new TSLA owner.  You could also consider selling a further OTM CC, when doing this I like to look around 20-30 delta (as I'm looking at TSLA right now with it trading at 862 that would be a CC somewhere in the 900 - 920 range)."

I use covered calls, but there is risk involved as with everything in the stock market. I would also recommend always rolling your calls to avoid assignment if you can take a credit without pushing it out more than \\~45 days."

     "You're on the right path.  But the number 1 rule is never let your shares get purchased.  You never want hold the same contract anywhere close to expiry.   \nFor example.  If you sell a contract for 23.00 per share and bring in $2,300 in premium.  You will watch the stock for the next couple days. If it stays at a similar share price, that contract will be worth less each day(thus making you a profit).  A professional trader will buy back that contract on Tuesday or  Wednesday for $1,700 or $1,200  - making  $600 - $1,100 profit. \n\nThen sell another contract and repeat.  \n\nAgain, the number 1 rule - DO NOT let your shares get exercised and ideally, don't own the same contract anywhere close to expiry.   \n\n\nFurther example, based on the scenario above.  You sell a contract brining in $2,300 premium.  on Wednesday the share price has increased to $814. You now but back that contract ... given the time decay, it may only cost you $2,400-$2,500 ( could be slightly more)  Then immediately sell a $820 for the following Friday bringing in $2,500.  (This being called a roll over) \n\nStock price stays the same or goes down, you win on the premium (but lose on the stock price.  This is why you should choose a stock which you want to hold long term\n\nStock price goes up, you need the liquidity to roll over to a future date.  you lose a bit on the buy back, but gain on rolling over to a future date (plus have the increased stock price in your portfolio)\n\n  \nThe method described above is not a get rich quick system. it's slow, safe and methodical generating a few thousand dollars per month. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll take it one step further, and probably be downvoted to oblivion.    \n\n\n$GME is a highly volatile and heavily discussed stock on Reddit.  With $100,000 you could purchase 800 shares (stock trading at $120)  Weeklies at $128 for this Friday are 4.80 last sale price ( $480 per contract x 8 contracts = $3,840)  I only own 50 GME shares, but i will tell you, Options are tempting given the volatility and options pricing\n\nWith $TSLA you are putting all eggs in one basket (in order to get the 100 shares necessary)\n\nYou could purchase 500 $GME shares as well as 10 $GOOG shares.  In July GOOG does a 20-1 stock split and voila, you now own 200 shares of GOOG which you can implement the same strategy as above. \n\nMyself, I use the strategy above, but I've picked some long term growth stocks in a TFSA, so I'll be ready in a few years to really capitalize on monthly income.  $SOFi is one that I just purchased at the $10.60.  Once this one grows over $20, it will generate enough options pricing for me to sell contracts.  In my standard investment account I pull in $1,000 per month just having fun with selling contracts.. however, the past 6 months have been great.. the market is turning the other direction and I've purchased some contracts... longer term, so I can sell poor man covered calls while the market goes the other way. \n\nGood luck to you. You are on the right path."

On a purely fundamental basis, there are a lot of red flags in the profitability and valuation DD:\n\nhttps://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ENPH/summary?search=ENPH\n\nBut if you compare that profile to other momentum stocks with macro-level tailwinds, it doesn't look that bad. It looks pretty average on that basis, and compared to GME and AMC, it looks like a solid gold winner, lol.\n\nCan you come up with bear scenarios? Sure, easy. Cost of credit is still rising and big solar projects need a lot of debt-based funding to get off the ground, so you'd think there'd be a slowdown. But so far, that's not showing up in ENPH's quarterlies.\n\nSo my basic rule is, even if the DD says danger ahead, I don't bet against momentum."

     "Definately looking overvalued, but they ARE profitable and are having what looks to be a record year. Next quarter is projected to be phenomenal as well. It\u2019s weird to see companies in this market trading over 100 times full year earnings earnings (they\u2019re looking like they\u2019ll make $300 million this year ) there\u2019s nothing that says this stock has to go down. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t even on my radar but now it\u2019s looking like an intriguing possibility. They have about $1 billion in cash on hand.\n\nIf they weren\u2019t profitable yet and had a less cash on the balance sheet it would be a no brainer, but they aren\u2019t at risk of going bankrupt, they\u2019re making decent money (25% margins is decent I guess nowadays?) and they\u2019re actually growing by leaps and bounds.\n\nYou\u2019re basically betting that some black swan event occurs that stops people from installing solar, slowing house builds isn\u2019t enough clearly because housing starts have already slowed and it\u2019s not translating over to Enphase, in fact it\u2019s the opposite, they\u2019re going to have a record year.\n\nTough call.. LOTS of meat on the bone, I could see them easily dropping to $30 a share and no one else would bat an eye in this market.\n\nThe other Con about buying outs is how expensive they are, $4.00 for May $120 puts??? There\u2019s not a single contract on that chain that\u2019s a decent risk reward, I\u2019m specifically looking for sub $1.00 options and the chain doesn\u2019t even go that low. If you could get mid to low $200 strikes for under $1.00 I\u2019d probably be down, but no way I\u2019m putting up $2200 on something that would have to move TWO standard deviations just to break even.\n\nYou won\u2019t start making intrinsic profit until $269\u2026 AND you have to risk a shitload of cash for the privilege.\n\nAnyway, no one knows what it\u2019s gonna do, it\u2019s probably not for me, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least to see the stock at $150 and dropping. Just not a good enough risk/reward for me to out real money into it"

I think it's interesting in general.\\n\\nI took my position some days ago, but for this example i use actual prices.\\n\\nExpiry Jan22: You sell 1 lot of 850$ put (delta 36) at 245$ and 1 lot of 1000$ call (55 delta) at 201$. You received 446$ per share (44,600$ total). IV is 76%. Your delta is negative due to very high IV that distrorts delta of options...but dont worry because the passage of time will reduce this distortion. Now you can just wait and hope: if at expiry Tesla will be between 850 and 1000 you will gain all your premium (return is more than 50% of your exposure, so very high). Your breakeven point is 404$ on downside and 1446$ on upside. During the life of the options you will gain for Theta (very low at the beginning) and mostly you will gain if IV will go down.

But more electric vehicles and more efficient ways to replace fossil fuel driven systems means less demand for oil.\n\nI don't really see any direct affects in the short term on the energy sector though.

Then on the other side you should be employing bullish strategies on RIVN as you see fit with market condition. \n\nJust because you think this ratio will come to be does not determine how the market will make this ratio happen.

     "You could do a pairs trade maybe? This is where have a long position (real or synthetic) in one stock, and a short in the other. Here's how it could work.\n\nLet's assume that ABC and XYZ have a strong correlation such that XYZ is usually $10 less than ABC. And right now, the stocks are only $X apart, where X is some number other than 10. To profit here, you would go long on one symbol and go short on the other. Your expectation is that at some point, *relative to each other*, one will gain value and the other will lose value. It doesn't really matter what their current prices are, or even what their prices will end up being in the future, as long as the stocks *trend towards* that $10 difference.\n\nLet's use actual numbers to illustrate:\n\nScenario 1: ABC now is $100. XYZ is now $97. Go long ABC, short XYZ.\n\n* Scenario 1-A: ABC later is at 130. XYZ is at 120. Your long stock has gained $30. The short stock has lost $23. Total profit is $7.\n\n* Scenario 1-B: ABC is later at $80. XYZ is at $70. Long stock in ABC has lost you $20. Short stock in XYZ has gained you $27. Net gain is (again) $7.\n\nScenario 2: ABC is currently at $100, XYZ is at $85. Now go long XYZ and short ABC.\n\n* Scenario 2-A: ABC laters goes to $120, XYZ to $110. ABC has lost you $20 and XYZ has gained $25. Net gain is $5.\n\n* Scenario 2-B: ABC later goes to $50, XYZ to $40. ABC has gained you $50, XYZ has lost you $45. Net gain is $5.\n\nThe upside here is that this doesn't rely on a bear market or a bull market. Up, down, doesn't matter. All you care about is that correlation to correct the prices relative to each other.\n\nThis gets a bit harder to apply when the relationship isn't a fixed dollar amount, but a ratio instead. You would need to change the amount of shares/contracts in one position or the other.\n\ntl;dr if you believe in the correlation and the correlation is currently out of alignment, short one side and long the other to profit off of the correction of that correlation."

I guess I was not flagged as a pdt.. sounda like going forward they will restrict my account for 97 days if I do this again. Annoying since the most I personally had at risk was only 150k which I was ok with. Ohwell thanks for all the comments and special thanks to the snarky remarks.'",

     "I will tell you why - because you made a trade without having sufficient funds in your margin account. You sold 1000 contracts at  what ever price your vertical spread was at. They are laying that money out on margin . What if you closed the spread the wrong way , closed your long position first incorrectly, leaving you naked on a short leg position. Tesla tanks - do you have 750 a share  x 100,000 shares? 7.5 million ?No if you did you wouldn\u2019t get that letter - they would have frozen your account till the trade settles - three business days . You had a weekend in between hence it took five days - what if you lost . A vertical spread at Schwab is not automatic. It has to be closed manually by you. \n\nHere is where you are at, you must call as a day trade restriction was filed against you . You get one warning , but you must call. You will now be told to up the amount in your margin account or they will restrict your trade to only what is in there 25,000 minimum. If you don\u2019t have that you can no longer trade - you said you just made 5x that so no problem . \n\nIf you happen to get Mr - Ms Hardass on the phone , they can strip you of any margin trades , revoke your level two trading status , drop you to a level one cash only account . Watch how you speak to then . They are the money police - ask for a derivatives broker , they will transfer you to the bad boy department. \n\nOne more day trade restriction and its bye bye margin trading for good cash only"

I'll think you'll get off cheap here.\n\nSecond, you're short 1 contract.  How much did you sell that for?  $100?  $200?  If you get assigned you'll be short 100 shares with a $900 cost basis.  If TSLA opens on monday at $905 and you buy to close then you'll be at a loss of $5 \\* 100 shares = $500 less your premium so lost only $300 to $400.\n\nIf Tesla opens at $895 then you made $500 plus your premium kept.\n\nHead over to r/thetagang and TastyTrade's youtube channel.  If you're going short on options, especially naked, you need to learn to calculate risk/reward to ensure you make money long term and also some basic do's/don't such as 'always BTC before expiry'.  Also download Think or Swim and setup a paper trading account to practice.  You can do it on the weekend using the replay feature.\n\nThis is not an account ending lesson learned the hard way.

     "You should have received your assignment notification by now, if you indeed were going to get assigned. Did you?\n\nSince it was a call, you will *receive* $90k in cash and be short 100 shares. So you will be praying for TSLA to open Monday below 900. The higher it goes, the more trouble you will be in. But even so, keep in mind you got that $90k cash, so even if it goes to say $905, you're net loss in covering will only be $500, plus borrowing and transaction fees.\n\nIf you want to put a cap on your Market open exposure, open a GTC limit order to cover the short shares now, and pick a limit that is above 900. Like 905 or however much you are willing to lose automatically. That won't save you from a big gap up on open, but it will make sure you are filled for the best possible price if it opens below your limit. So if TSLA opens at 899 and immediately ticks up to 907 and stays above that the rest of the day, you have a shot at covering for a profit, as opposed to trying to do it manually and missing the market.\n\nIf it gaps up huge, you might get margin called. That's the worst-case scenario. The more cash (above and beyond the 90k) and equity you have in the account, the lower your risk of a margin call."

If you buy a single put option with 815 strike, that option will cost you $59.90 right now so your break even is that you need Tesla under $755 to make money. If you buy a single option, you want to be directionally certain of the direction of the move. \n\nInstead - do a spread to lower your risk. Buy the 815 strike Put (costs $60) // Sell the 750 strike (pays $34.50) for $25.55 net debit and max profit of $49.45 per contract if Tesla drops to $750 or lower. \n\nOf course, if you REALLY know that Tesla is going to drop, then go right ahead and buy the single Put option at full price and ignore the spread. But if really knew that Tesla was going one direction or another you would not be new to options and you be minted already. So take the safer bet - the put spread. Way cheaper if you are wrong."

     "> My question though is why my P/L is swinging so much and if that is due to the amount of Open Interest or just because its Tesla and the price swings so much? \n\nIt's mostly bid/ask reacting to TSLA price moves. Your delta is 72, so you get 72% of the $ price movement of TSLA. I looked at the order book and while it's pretty healthy, the tape is pretty quiet, not a lot of trades filling. Nevertheless, the bid/ask is swinging through about $1 every few seconds."

     "Elon's ability to keep the hype train rolling is 2nd to none.  Take a look at what happened when Dr. Burry, the king of brass balls and short positions, announced his short position in $TSLA.  Dr. Burry lays out a very reasonable and encouraging message to Elon to issue shares and take profits to cement Tesla's existence.  He even used an email from Elon where he himself admits that the stock price is not based in real value.  In response Elon essentially jingled some keys by announcing a massive Bitcoin position.  I'm guessing he has dozens of such distractions ready to go since the entire existing electricity model can be improved by leaps and bounds.  Not to mention you can electrify new things like boats, ships, bikes, boards, flight, etc. Each of these would serve as fuel for the hype train.  Also there was the flame thrower...\n\nTLDR:  It's Dr. Burry's brass balls VS Elon's long shlong."

I've had a roller coaster ride with options, but lately, I've lost a lot of money in the last month that I'm dead inside and don't think I'll ever be able to trade logically again without being hampered by emotions.\\n\\nAs an example, around March I sold my Tesla shares for $300 less than what I paid for it. However, Tesla stock soared afterward, and if I hadn't used my paper hand, I would have been getting greens by around 40%.\\n\\nMy problem was that I didn't plan ahead of time before initiating a deal. I really just have emotion to bargain with. Before entering any trade-in, I should've had an exit strategy in place and established what I was seeking to achieve and being realistic. Any advice on how to be less emotionally invested in your trades would be appreciated...\"",

     "Take a break if you start to get emotional with trading. Occasionally, for a few weeks, and occasionally, for a few months. It is quite helpful. Trading isn't worth the anguish and frustration... If you're not in the appropriate frame of mind, you'll keep making poor choices out of desperation until your account is entirely blown. \r  \n\r  \nTell you what, you can try using a trading bot assuming you have a lot of experience this time around. For this, I recommend [Breaking Equity](https://www.breakingequity.com/?r=1). They help you stay in control of your emotions during the trading process, making it simpler to stick to your strategy and maintain your discipline."

This way if something is down big, you can\u2019t just start trading because you aren\u2019t in the broker app - it\u2019ll gives you a moment to think before you react and check the news too. This helps me decide if the reason I bought is still intact or not and then I decide accordingly.\n\nThe second thing I do is set a price target for the position and add a notification on my tracker app, once again, not my broker. As I mentioned it helps me from opening my broker and trading. If my PT gets hit I re-evaluate and then decide if I feel like riding it out some more and set a new price target and keep holding or selling. I mostly sell because I\u2019m conservative on my short term trades as I just use it to help grow my long stock at this point in life. \n\nI do this for anything 3+ months options and short term shares. I just do earnings checkups on my long holds. \n\nUsing a separate app in general has me in the habit of opening the tracker app instead of my broker, so way less trading and more watching for opportunity."

Think in bets and not outcome. Maybe your decision to sell Tesla was the right decision. You never know about the future, you can just make a decision based on known facts. You have two aces on your hand and go all in: maybe not the wrong decision. You have nothing and go all in but somehow still win unexpectedly: well, good outcome for you but it was not a good play.

Instead of panic sell, i just let go and treated as if it doesnt exist and just left it untouched and moved onto other stocks as i knew the company would spring back sometime later. Took longer than expected but did work out. As for emotional trading, i do believe it helps abit as most ppl think thee similar - if you have strong urge to buy, hold or sell as so many others would do the same. BUT always do some DD before investing unless you are just tossing fee cents here and there just to have some fun like playing slots."

     "My options portfolio is up 293% for the year as of yesterday ($16,700 -> $71,077), but there were years when I too was an emotional trader and lost a lot of money because of it. There\u2019s no shortcut to this lesson, and it\u2019s the single most important and PRODUCTIVE lesson you can learn- congratulations! You\u2019ve experienced what it\u2019s like to trade your feelings  and you will be that much more equipped to be able to ignore them when you open your next positions. As you state, having defined exit plans, or any plans at all, is a huge step toward ensuring that happens. Stock prices never do what you \u201cwant\u201d them to do, but will frequently do what you \u201cthink\u201d they\u2019ll do. \n\nMy advice is 1), regularly reassess if your opinion about what the price will do has changed. If so, adjust accordingly. If not, do nothing (always an overlooked option), and if you\u2019re not sure, do nothing until you are. Dont let your feelings tell you that you must always do something.\n\n 2) Keep track of how often you\u2019re right and wrong so you can make sure the gains you take are large enough to offset the losses. You should be able to know what those ratios are, so if you don\u2019t, start keeping track. \n\nDon\u2019t stop trading! You\u2019ve just learned what will help you make big gains in the years to come!"

If you plan your trading from start to finish you are prepared for negative outcomes also. It is not a sudden event and gives you experience also to make better trades in the future. Don't focus of how the trade evolved but focus on entry and exit planning according to your risk tolerance."

     "The best changes I've made to my strategy after destroying my portfolio are as follows:  \n\n\n**1) There is no such thing as a missed opportunity.**  \nYes, black swan events are rare.    \nHowever, there are so many cases of stocks going up or down by 100s of % in a day or 1000s in a year.  \nChasing a stock is a fool's game and very VERY rarely pays off.  \nDon't try to force an entry or exit point onto a stock you're (emotionally) invested in.  \nIf you have a strategy (swing trading etc) then look for opportunities that fit your criteria and don't try to convince yourself that there's an opportunity there otherwise.\n\n**2) There are only three things that matter when assessing stocks** ***(and they all affect each other.)***  \nTechnical Analysis attempts to measure sentiment, what the market believes is fair value based on buying and selling pressures at different levels of valuation.  \nTA typically remains correct until something changes.\n\nFundamental Analysis looks at actual data, news, numbers.  If TA is the driver then FA is the cop with a speed camera who will chase you down if you're out of line.  Sometimes TA runs away from FA but that's never done without the help of the last one.\n\nSentiment Analysis, which takes things like social media posts and attempts to gauge the wider public opinion about a stock.  This one is fickle, full of liars and trolls.  However, it can be helpful to guide your analysis towards FA or TA if you're unsure.  \n\n\n**3) Leave your ego at the door.**\n\nThis one might be the most relevant for you.  \nIf you have too much ego/confidence you won't second-guess your DD when it's wrong.  \nIf you have too little confidence you won't stop doubting your DD when it's correct.\n\nBe Confident about your DD but avoid confirmation bias, avoid FOMO, avoid unfounded FUD.\n\nBe Objective.  Take the information into consideration in a dispassionate way and use your chosen analyses to figure out if it's helpful to your end goal.\n\nFinally, sometimes results will have nothing to do with your DD.  A company gets bought up at a good price and you pat yourself on the back, even though it was nothing but luck.  \nThat's your ego convincing you that you somehow earned those gains. You didn't really.\n\nSometimes you had everything right and some news comes out that tanks the stock.  \nIt sucks, but that's not on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps."

I do the opposite of what my gut tells me to buy low and sell high.\n\nAlso, maybe you just need to read some literature? Learn about [Kelly Criterion](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/mn0ykx/kellys_criterion_for_gamblers/). It describes, how you are likely to lose, even when the chances are for you, just because of sizing. Don't be overleveraged, it is bad for your mental health and money. It is very important. Learn about the damn risk management! I size my bets, so my max loss on each is not that big. I have some naked puts against margin, but I'll easily stomach even a circuit breakers day.\n\nI think you should put it all aside to calm down and go read some books on this.\n\nAnd the literature says, that you probably won't beat the market, see the arguments for the efficient market hypothesis.

Bad for options, cause volatility and not traded outside hours. Bad, cause not the best price. Bad, cause you cannot wait a bit after a spike. My stop losses would be at like -40% of the stock value, so I just don't bother. Maybe they are very useful for day traders or something.\n\nOr maybe you just screw it and go become a [boglehead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/)? It is not a bad decision, not at all. Just as I won't ever recommend trading, I always recommend passive investing."

I like this option because it will grow much like owning 100 shares without dishing out the 100k capital. I can buy for about 50k give or take. \\n\\nLets say Tesla is near 2k per share when I want to sell after about 12 months. My option will be even deeper in the money. Whats my worst case to sell this option if liquidity dries up? Ive heard an options contract, as long as its in the money, will always sell for its intrinsic value. So is this calculated in my scenario by subtracting the share price of 2k minus my strike price of 400? So I get 1600 of intrinsic value. Or 160k value to my options contract I purchase for 50k. Is this correct?\\n\\nSo my concern is obviously liquidity. But could someone confirm what Im saying is correct? And if so, how do I force this sale if liquidity dries up?'",

I make thousands a month doing this.  \n\nI sell puts on stocks I want to own. For example I sold a put a few months back on UPST at 125 a share. I made 7$ a share and when i sold it the stock was trading at 128$.  So it got put to me at 125$ a share and I got paid to wait the week to buy it lower than the current price.  I just started covering it and selling calls since I made over 200% on the stock and now I\u2019m generating 4-8% a month on the call side till I sell it.  \n\nFor covered calls I do no longer than a month or two.  With at least a 10% upside and I can usually make 1-2% a month.  With the puts I make more but it isn\u2019t all the time.  I have to want that stock if I\u2019m selling puts.\n\nMy accounts total 1.4 million that I have for options. Almost 3 million of purchasing power if you add my margin account."

     "Ok, so here's a position that's active for me today, for a bit of illustration.\n\nThe underlying is $AM, Antero Midstream, an operator of gas pipelines in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.\n\nSince February, I have been acquiring long shares, and selling CCs on it. I bought a total of 900 shares, paying $7984, $8.87/share. The CCs in that time frame gave me $517 premium. I rolled them near expiry most of the time, starting out OTM, but as the share price rose, they were ITM. While all this was going on, I collected $247 in dividends in 2Q and 3Q 2021.\n\nThis month, they were far enough ITM that it was worthwhile for someone to extingish their extrinsic value to collect the dividend, and because today, Oct 26, is the ex-div date, they were called away early. I got $10 per share on them, for $9000.\n\nSo, total gains were 1016 in capital equity appreciation, 517 premium, and 247 dividend, for a total of $1780 on $7984 invested, a gain of 22%. I held the average share about 5 months, so that annualizes to 53% ROI. I am very satisfied with this.\n\nNow could I have made more? Sure, the shares are presently trading for $11.22 a share, so some one got that extra. What premium they paid to get it, I cannot say. But I made good money, and am off to other investments."

     "A lot of how you trade depends on your risk tolerance - we sell out of the money puts on stocks that wouldn't mind owning. The basic strategy is:  \n\\- choose stocks and ETFs with liquid option series  \n\\- narrow down to stocks we wouldn't mind owning at a cheaper price  \n\\- look at annualized yield for different expirations to determine the best one to sell   \n\\- a few other more complex parameters around vol skew, technicals, earnings, portfolio etc  \n\n\nTwo real examples below (disclaimer: not recommendations), to give you a sense of what you would make:  \n\n\nSPY:  \nSell the Dec3 380.00 strike PUT  \nCash needed: $38,000 (fully cash covered)  \nDays to expiry: 39  \nTheoretical price: $0.51  \nAnnualized yield: 1.2%  \n\n\nARKK:  \nSell the Dec3, 112 strike PUT  \nCash needed: 11,200 (fully cash covered)  \nDays to expiry: 39  \nTheoretical price: $2.42  \nAnnualized yield: 20.4%  \n\n\nSo, as you can see, for an ETF the lowest risk would be 1.2% per year, the more risky would be 20.4% return on your cash.  \n\n\nYou can turn that up by:  \n\\- selling single stock options (take a look at COIN or SNAP to get an idea)  \n\\- using margin (but if you get assigned, you'd have to manage very carefully - doesn't happen often if you're selling 10-20% out of the money, but it does, so beware!)  \n\n\nHope that helps!"

Usually I would say to keep them wide but if you\u2019re already really levered up use the sold call premium as a way to offset the loss on the put spread if your bullish assumption is wrong. You\u2019ll pay off this position in about a year assuming there isn\u2019t a massive breakout or a massive decline. In my opinion there is no way we will see a huge decline in the GDX in fact I will personally send you the $500 dollars if the GDX falls more than 20% in the next year."

The reason for the drop was chatter that the Chinese government was going to limit the amount of tutoring that could be done in certain segments at certain times. A huge proportion of students were paying for tutoring. The students did this in order to better compete, and the feeling was that the government wanted to reduce student academic stress and family financial stress.\n\nI felt the company could deal with a moderate reduction in revenue.\n\nWhat the government wound up doing was much more severe than anyone expected: they said the tutoring services had to become not-for-profits. TAL dropped 70% in one day, to $6, and is now a little above $3."

     "I agree that the earnings report was very good for Tesla, but I disagree with a lot of your assumptions or opinions at the end. \n\n1.  To say that this means all the talk about Lucid or Nio not being competition is a little short-sighted.  For one, Lucid will just now be delivering products to consumers in this upcoming quarter, so we can\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a better product or not until we see it.  Nio for their part is actually doing quite well in China which poses a threat to Tesla\u2019s ambition in trying to gain market share there.  Let\u2019s not forget the fiasco surrounding Chinese customers not happy about the QC in their newly delivered Model 3s.  And with the Chinese government basically saying Tesla spies on Chinese citizens, this could have an impact on sales in the region.  If Nio is able to expand production and penetrate markets beyond Asia, they may indeed be a force to be reckoned with.  And let\u2019s not forget Rivian, GMs electric push, Toyota entering the space next year, and the success of Hyundai/Kia.\n\n2. You mentioned Tesla AI being an attractive feature for the future of autonomous driving, but you failed to mention that Tesla believes in going all in on just using cameras for their autonomous system. This is a HUGE problem as the cameras are only reliable in certain weather conditions and there is no fail safe in place when the system fails.  Why do you think every other major car manufacturer and autonomous driving companies use a host of sensors including LiDAR?  It\u2019s because autonomous driving is only as good as the ability of the system to gain as much information as possible from the environment and be able to process that data.  Not to mention engineering redundancy is a great way to have a fail safe measure in case something happens.  If camera 23 goes bad or no longer functions properly (which camera failures happen in cars a lot), then the LiDAR is able to provide a fail safe to pick up where that camera left off.  Is there a glare preventing camera 11 from capturing data? No worries, the sensors can provide information where that camera can\u2019t. Which brings me to my last point\u2026\n\n3. Tesla is great because of Elon but it also has many shortcomings because of Elon\u2019s ego.  In fact, if Tesla were to fail tomorrow it\u2019s most likely because his ego got in the way.  This is what keeps some investors weary of the company.  Elon said he thought LiDAR was dumb technology that wasn\u2019t needed and is doubling down on cameras only as the solution.  The biggest complaint in the new Plaid models is the steering wheel, with even Marques Brownlee saying it would be a great car except for this and yet Elon Musk is doubling down saying he won\u2019t offer any other type of wheel.  It\u2019s Elon\u2019s ego that can end up being the downfall of the company.  And that\u2019s something investors have to be mindful about."

     "I streamed the call and I did not like the tone of the call, this was going to be a nothing call anyways as nothing new was really going on but I did not like a few things about it. \n\n1. Elon did not sound optimistic about anything, he kept telling us why things were taking time vs telling us when things were going to finish. \n2. He wavered on next year growth between 50 and 100%, this is telling me that he thinks they'll get delivering new cars out of the new factors in Q2 next year or late Q1. \n3. We won't get to 1M vehicles this year, not that we have to, but about 830-850k inline with analysts. \n4. FSD isn't ready and he didn't hype it at all. \n5. Subscriptions were a bust as he didn't hype it, he eve said \"at this point the value proposition on subscriptions are so-so, we need to get FSD done\". Doesn't sound we see the light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nI think 2021 is going to be pretty sideways for the stock, it reminds me of the 2018 when we knew that China was going to open and we were looking for the 5k per week number and went through production hell, then came out the other side of it. At that point the stock started rallying, once Tesla got some scale. \n\nWe are going through that again, but this time with 2 factories, an entirely new way of building cars, with brand new battery chemistry, with brand new ways to install the batteries in the cars with brand new factors in brand new places and during a chip shortage. \n\nSo this earnings call asked for patience and we'll give Tesla as much time as they need, its super hard to do what they are doing and we ask too much too soon. \n\nMy opinion is that the stock will just hang around until we see some clarity and results like in 2018, so a great time to buy more! Every month just buy more."

There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fools premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4Xed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.\\n\\nBasically, **What I wanted \"",

But for some reason people can't separate that from the b.s. articles on their web site. The two things are two completely different entities. Freelancers write those articles and they have ZERO to do with the advisor service and recommendations. TLDR, the MF stock advisor service does work as advertised. Hate all you want."

     "Some anecdotal evidence here, I used to subscribe to SA some 15 years ago (left because I went on a student loan paying binge for a few years and never came back).  They made recommendations on Marvel and Netflix and a few other good ones. If I had kept my initial investment in NFLX I would be a retired multimillionaire today.\n\nWhat TMF doesn\u2019t exactly tell you in the stupid advertising is that these folks actually do real research into their companies. And not just fundamental analysis either. They\u2019ll call the CEOs and talk strategy. Look for real industry leadership.  Research competitors.  Put in some honest legwork (or at least they tell you they do these things). More research than I usually do anyways, but that\u2019s not saying much I suppose.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not some paid shill, my experience with them in the \u201800s was fine. Good actually. And I whatever y\u2019all can hate me for my opinion, but not everything they do sux.\n\nAlso, FWIW, I work in the water treatment field and our company is an industry leader. One of the ways we keep on top of our competitors is to write a bunch of fluff blog posts and hold light-on-content webinars that keep people engaged. Our website is the top result on a bunch of search keywords. How do we do this?  Campy marketing tactics. Ded serious.  Is it pathetic?  Maybe.  Profitable?  Absolutely."

     "I think your conclusion is right on. I've talked to a number of people who work there (back-end tech side) and they all pretty much know this. They hate the spam too, but it works. It's a weird company in that respect. Stock Advisor is actually a good product from what I can tell, but they also up-sell like crazy and the expensive products don't have the same track-record of performance. \n\nCynically, SA is the entry-level credibility establisher. Getting people from 0 to >0 spend is the hardest part in the sales funnel, so they have their strongest product at >0, but affordable. Then they actually give you a good product to build a solid core SA subscriber base. \n\nBut this also establishes a core of people willing to spend money on newsletters. Then the up-selling kicks in. Once you've established that someone has money, is willing to give it to you, and you've convinced them that you're not scamming them (and SA isn't), then you can sell the expensive stuff. If you get 1 person into an expensive product it's worth annoying a lot of low-tier subscribers, many of whom will deal with the annoyance because they like the product they're getting. Their newsletter margins come from selling Super Big Tech Trends 3D Printing VR Growth 10000x Newsletters for 2-10k/year. Same logic applies to outside sales; you need crazy amounts of spam to drive subscriptions and they sure know it."

     "This analysis is missing *one* thing. The relative size of the companies in question at time of suggestion. The reason I say that is I have a feeling, though I can't provide for it, that the companies selected by Stock Advisor likely are just \"drifting\". What I mean by this is that they are mid-cap companies with little to no threat of going bankrupt; in that case the odds that they will rise naturally over time are very high.\n\nIf one were to invest in a 5 factor model type portfolio one should beat the market by means of simply reducing diversification, that is, one never buys the losers with the winners, and so if one doesn't have the \"drag\" one doesn't have bad returns. This is the same problem as putting all of your money into Amazon; it would look like a genius move today to do so but if you had factored it and decided that it was a sound investment 2x years ago you'd have made a lot more than the SP500 specifically because Amazon *in* the SP500 is being dragged *down* by other things.\n\nI don't know how much of the portfolio recommendations are in the SP500 today but if it's a large enough amount one of the key factors for them could have been just choosing what would enter into that index, or rather, any index; companies that \"qualify\" but aren't actually in the indices are also high priority targets simply because in order to get into an index you have to have your finances right to begin with and you need to be, among other things, particularly business savvy which means no one is afraid you'll go bankrupt.\n\nThe sell recommendations probably run the same logic; much like we pick winners by looking at their fundamentals and likeliness of maintaining value and future-forward concepts there's a good chance that they either dump or discourage things that are either no longer viable or almost impossible to maintain. For instance the Tesla recommendation wasn't actually a \"bad\" one; 2020 was a strange year for certain but the odds that Tesla would have been in play in that year without all that was going on are probably not that high. The same is true for a number of closures of businesses as well; it required an extraordinary event to take the mundane to godlike. Now I'm not saying that Tesla isn't an industry leader or that it's CEO isn't who he is but I am saying that the widespread nature of the concept here is significantly dependent on the timing rather than the merits of the business itself and the viability of the technology which is still in early stages.\n\nI guess what I am saying is that without an analysis of just the general nature of the companies suggested and when there's a missing link; there's likely a sound commonality between the companies that can effectively be taken with little effort but they're counting on people simply not doing that; furthermore we do have a recursion to consider, that is, much like Kramer, if it appears in \"The Fool\" the natural outcome of that company may be changed and the trajectory raised esp. since they release, like Morningstar and others, their own price projections which I assume they release in their own favor meaning that they generate the buzz, set the price floor, and then let drift work on companies that were generally mundane but also relatively safe or with competent serial entrepreneurial leaders who don't fail often in businesses.\n\nThat's what I think is under the hood of the data itself. Not that I am saying the data isn't valid, it is, it's just that history rarely produces rational propositions on how something occurred and instead just expresses that it occurred."

     "The price of an option is calculated from a number of components:\n\nUnderlying, Strike Price, Days to Expiry, Interest Rate, Option Type and X.\n\nAmong the entire list above, the **first 5 are always known at any given point of time**. So why does an option price still vary keeping the first 5 factors constant. It's the variable X. That represents the \"**error**\" or \"**uncertainty**\" in the calculation. It is also termed as IV - IMPLIED volatility.\n\nSo to calculate what an option price should be at the moment, you need to know what the IV is. You could assume a number, let's say 40% and use that to calculate the price of the option. Let's say the price of the option on calculation, comes out to be $1.5.\n\nNow the next step depends on what your goal was:\n\n1. Was your goal to find out the price of the option given that you think the IV was 40%.\n2. Or was your goal to find out the IV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If your goal was the former, then it's done, you know the price is $1.5 given an IV of 40%. (This goal is generally for people who are doing projections of option pricing assuming certain market conditions.)\n2. If your goal was the latter, then you check whether the price of the option in the market is also $1.5. Let's say it's not, it's $1.2. You change the IV and use 30% to calculate the option price. Let's say this time it comes out to be $0.9. You change the IV again, and use 33% to calculate the option price, this time it comes out to be $1.1. If this is close enough for you, then you can assume the IV to be 33%. if it's not, then you use 34% to calculate and it comes out to be $1.22. Is that close enough? If yes, you can consider the IV to be 34%. If not ... so on and so forth till you are happy with the value.\n\nThat's why IV is also called the \"error\" or \"uncertainty\" parameter. You iteratively calculate it by trial and error. You don't need to do it by hand, there are programs which do it for you based on the BS model.\n\nHope that helped."

But - supply and demand for the options contract pushes the price of that options contract around, and the resulting IV for that options contract is simply an output from the options-pricing formula. Knowing what the long-term IV is for that underlying is what informs you re: whether to buy or sell that option premium.\n\nEdit: I should clarify- the IV assumption associated with a specific options contract (either input into or derived from the options pricing formula) is the estimate of the annual standard deviation of the underlying security price. \n\nThe OP\u2019s question is a good one. I\u2019m a long-time options trader, former market-maker at the CBOE. There are many nuances to this question and its answer, depending on the perspective of the question. Many of the answers/reply\u2019s are getting to the heart of it but agreed, there are basics to be understood before some of these answers, and the perspectives they represent, will make sense. I\u2019d agree, ignore the interpolation of IV to the expected stock price move over the next week/month/year. Supply and demand for options will create IV an an output that can be disconnected from the \u2018reality\u2019 represented by the OP\u2019s stock price projection chart. Demand for insurance via wing puts drives up IV for those options, creating the vol smile or skew you often see for example. Hope this helps"

     "A very good question.\n\nOk, to clarify. Each option has an individual IV. That means each strike, in each expiration cycle, and a Put or Call per strike.\n\nThe underlying also has an IV. That is calculated for every expiration.\n\nWe can see that in your example, or expressed as IV Index in the options chain. But since IV can only be derived from options, the 'underlying IV' must be based on the options within that expiration cycle. My understanding is that it is always the ATM option, because it is usually the most heavily traded, and it is the option's price that determines IV, and not IV that determines the price.\n\nI also researched this question but couldn't find a good explanation. It's probably somewhere in the Black Scholes formula which I am too lazy to work through  \ud83d\ude02  Probably the commenter below who said that it's \"sugar for dumb retail traders to rot their minds with, ignore it\" got it right how it's calculated.

     "The price of an option given its strike and expiry implies a volatility for the underlying stock. This is made evident when you look at an options pricing model to see where the sigma in the model comes from.\n\nSuperficially it may seem like, given that definition, that every option in the chain should yield the same IV, but of course they don't. On the other hand, their deviation from a single IV is not chaotic nor (very) random. Within the same expiry, for example, the mapping of the IV of all options in the chain will typically show a very systematic skew - a crooked smile with more of a smirk on the left side. (Generally this skew can be explained by hedging behavior and similar). To some extent this reflects that an options model does not and cannot reflect all of variables that actually connect an option price to its underlying price nor does the historical behavior of the stock itself perfectly reflect the assumed distribution of its behavior (lognormal for the stock and normal for the log growth rate of the stock). \n\nFinally and more important than anything else, the options pricing model that yields both the concept of historical volatility for the underlying and the estimated volatility of the same as implied by an option's price, is unable to incorporate any reasonable estimate of the price impact of a tail event, which explains why, at times like recent weeks in general for the market or just before earnings for specific stocks, IV rises, and it rises more for near-term expiries than long term expiries.\n\nThere is no point in consolidating IVs and there is no such thing as an IV for an option (an option is volatile, but there is no measurement that \"implies\" its range). It is incorrect to say that IV will \"tell you nothing.\" Even though strangely variable (to one just starting out), it is quite systematic and it is useful to compare IV measures to historical volatility of the underlying. It is IMO the must useful statistic in options trading."

I know it will go up or stay same. I will make money anyway unless tesla get $10 next year., it will be jackpot if Tesla split again. I have the stock at a reasonable price. My loss may be 50-100 if Tesla come down to $450, but I already collected more than 12K,,, and already made some money and will write another call next year. Why this seems so complicated? I don\u2019t know. You can buy it from your margin account and sell an option with 2 years expiration and get $15K back immediately. In six month if Tesla moves to $700 per share you can buy back your option and write a new one. This is what I am trying I added \u201cRiot\u201d to same list and \u201cBlok\u201d. Their option payouts are fantastic, There are people already bidding for up to $2-3K Tesla for next year or two.

     "Lending without credit score is nothing new. It has been existed and done for thousands of years in many countries which doesn't have a credit system like Americans. The notable Alibaba has been doing personal loans without credit scores long before UPST. There is no credit system in China and lots of other countries. \n\nEven in America lots of private lenders are fighting in this no credit required personal loan business. Amazon kept offering the small business loans without checking anything along with many private lenders when they charge 8-9 percent interest.\n\nThe red flags I see in UPST\n\n1) The earnings are not stable. They had a good year in 2019, then had a disastrous 2020 when their business almost done to zero. The high growth we see now is based on 2020. IThat says the business model highly depends on the overall capital market not safe proof.\n\n2) Their expansion into the auto market is over optimistic. Auto makers are offering nominal 2.9% interest to buyers with good credits, 5% to customers without a good credit score. UPST is charging from 6%-9% interest to their clients, I don't see how they would compete with the auto markers. It is reported they are buying Prodigy Software  for auto loans. They are not using their own AI platform?\n\n3) The insiders are selling their shares \"phenomenally\". WIthin 6 months their founder, co-founder, major company officers, the 10% owners are selling hilariously. No buying at all. If they are so confident the growth of their company, why they so eager to let their stock go? While analysts are recommending strong buy, the insiders are selling high."

TGT and WMT already said they are going to eat some of the costs to keep prices low to retain market share, and investors did not like that.\n\nZM - Don't know much about the company tbh, other than their video chat program that became popular during the pandemic. If that's all there is to know about the company, they look overvalued. \nI work in the banking/financial sector and only know of one company that uses their services, and it's the free version at that. If a large company already has an enterprise software product suite subscription, one of those products is probably the same thing as Zoom (MS Teams anyone)\n\nADSK - I'm mad I missed out on Intuit.

Even if they meet or beat revenue their growth going into next year won't be a justification for the absolutely ludicrous analyst price targets.

Create and follow a trading plan.  Having a documented plan forces you to be accountable to yourself if anything else.\n2. You need to know how you intend to manage your trade to profit or loss.

[http://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla](http://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla) .. you are better off doubling down. I usually take 1 or 2 contracts and as we get closer to expiration I consult the max pain and decide if I should double down based on that and the hourly chart action.  So, then I bail or double. Based on MaxPain .. you probably are right selling but maybe next time just see where max pain is. The stock will get help from those that control the options markets. You would then double down and then sell at the end of day today.  I sold NIO Call spread and watched it closely today and bought it back at the lows ... Then it ripped higher quickly ... Look at the NIO maxpain. This is why I took profits on my short call play as I expected it to bounce hard to try and get most options to expire worthless."

     "I've paid tuition to learn these lessons... 1st, you want to go in with a plan as to what your P&L targets are, and size them at a level relative to your account such that you won't panic sell and lock in a loss. Been there, done that, watched it turn around the next day. Seems to happen only on positions that are way too big a %age of my account.\n\n2nd, you want to make your plan as mechanical as possible so that your emotions don't get involved. I like to use limit orders for stop loss or profit target (or both, if your broker lets you do bracket/OCO (one-cancels-one) orders to set both at the same time. If you're looking at a trade and not feeling good about your exit points in total dollar terms or relative to the motion of the stock, downsize the trade or don't take it.\n\nI've also stopped buying plain calls and puts (after these last few, I promise) and have started buying debit spreads instead. Don't do this unless you know how to manage spreads (TL;DR never ever ever hold a spread into expiry + assignment), but with a debit spread you can either: get a call at a given strike for much less $ or for the same $ buy much closer to the money and have more delta on your side. \n\nIf I have a strong directional thesis on a stock (and options aren't super expensive, e.g. relatively low IV), I've been experimenting with buying a 40+delta option as part of a debit spread, paying no more than ~30% of the spread width. 100% profit / 50% loss are my exit points, and buying these on a dip in the stock price helps majorly of course."

If paper handing on a dip isn't in your plan it's against the rules to do it.\n\nI also suggest either holding longer or shorter.  By longer I mean buy 2 months out (or longer) so you can shrug off dips because you have time for it to recover.  By shorter I mean if you're looking for a short term trade then plan on always exiting before end of day.\n\nAlso, figure out what sorts of trades stress you out and avoid them.

     "I totally understand how you feel. When I first started trading, however, I was buying shares in companies I hadn't researched or knew much about. There were many times that I saw numbers going down and either panic sold early at a loss rather than riding out the dips, sold because there was a tiny bit of bad press, or hesitated YOLOing enough shares to really make a difference. Seeing prices rise and fall on some volatile stocks is an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nThat being said, over the past year, I'm at almost 200% ROI because I decided to make educated buys in companies that I had/still have faith in (Tesla, Microsoft, Square, etc.) and then put my portfolio away and stopped watching it like a hawk. Most gains happen over time, and as long as you have faith that the companies you bought into are good investments, don't worry about the daily changes (unless you're a day trader, in which case CHASE THOSE DIPS AND SELL AT THE PEAKS LOL). Just think, Google and Apple didn't rise in value overnight. If you buy and hold, not only do you get that long-term tax break on gains, but you reduce the amount of stress in your life.\n\n\nTL;DR: \n1. Research the companies you're interested in (DD is key)\n2. Buy the ones that you have faith in for growth potential.\n3. Pay attention to the news surrounding your investments.\n4. Don't helicopter-parent your portfolio\n(If you day-trade, ignore everything I said. Paper-handedness is part of the game. You'll learn to read trends and eventually get a good system going)"

There will always be opportunities to make money in a market. \u201cPatience pays\u201d\n\none of these is most likely the culprit to your trades\n\nAn simple way to combat this is to have a system either- TA/FA/Order flow whatever works best for you do this and do it consistently and those dips won\u2019t shake you out as much.

It gains when \"something happens\" in either direction. But the tradeoff is that your premiums add up quick. You might also look into Long Strangles, which is a Straddle but different strike prices - you get a wider range (bigger net) but the sacrifice is max gain is slightly reduced. Finally, there is a position called Short Iron Butterfly which gives you a similar payoff, but also a) has downside protection because it is comprised of spreads; and b) is a short position and sometimes being the seller is better. Check these out on Investopedia.com and study them! Good luck."

That means you would need the stock to move below 930 or above 1070 by close tomorrow to make any money.  It looks like that is still possible but opening this morning is going to be about 1050 so you aren't there yet.  It would be near impossible for this position to be a complete loss because it would have to peg your strike at expiration, but unless it keeps moving up basically another 2% over the next 2 days you will lose money.\n\nThat's the math, you are playing for a move outside of what is expected.

     "I occasionally trade long straddles, not dissimilarly to how you are describing, but in earnings season it can be a hit and miss strategy. The mechanics of the strategy are that you are betting on the stock being highly volatile. \n\nThe main issue with them is that they're expensive, because ATM options are, well, expensive. So, the higher the cost of the options, the more the stock needs to move in order for you to make money.\n\nIf you're a mathematical prodigy, you can try to figure out whether the IV of a specific straddle is underestimated - and that's likely to make you some money. But I, for one, struggle to believe that there are many such opportunities on the market. Sell-side derivatives traders are generally quite quick to act on any market imperfections they notice. \n\nThe timing of your specific strategy is also problematic, as market makers tend to expect volatility to rise around earnings announcements; they move accordingly, making options more expensive. This adds to the amount of actual price movement you would require to make a profit.\n\nLastly, like any long option strategy, you're going against theta - although generally if you keep the position open a few hours you're unlikely to lose a ton of money due to that. \n\nAs someone else said, look into similar strategies such as long strangles, etc. as well."
