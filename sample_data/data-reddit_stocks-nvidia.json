Nvidias shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmakers stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidias gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.\\n\\nSignificantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. Its been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Me'",

     "I'm a long time gamer and also one who witnessed the birth of RIVA TNT. I must admit until the last 3 to 4 years ago I still thought that Nvidia products are mostly for only graphics processing - until the crypto craze that has opened my eyes that GPU has more uses than for gaming. And now AI seems to be another interesting use for GPU.\n\nThis makes me feel curious in two points: \n\n1. aside from crypto and AI, in future would GPU's be also useful in other applications outside of literal 'graphics processing'? Because if so, then once the AI craze calms down, perhaps the value of GPU makers would still shine again in future uses.\n\n2. Would it be possible in future that GPU would somehow have their names changed, since their use would reach far other than graphics processing? Or they would retain its legacy name, just like 'hard disks' are still names used for hard drives in general, even though SSD has no disks anymore."

Let's swing through this exciting news using Monkey Banana Language.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia has become a huge banana tree in the jungle (reached a $1 trillion market cap), joining an exclusive club of only a few other giant trees, mostly in the tech forest.\r  \n\r  \nWhy has Nvidia grown so much? They've been growing a ton of shiny, attractive bananas (producing high-demand GPUs) that are important for both gaming and artificial intelligence platforms. As more monkeys (consumers) see the value of these bananas, they've been clamoring to get them.\r  \n\r  \nPlus, Nvidia's latest batch of bananas (earnings report) was even bigger and better than what most monkeys expected, which has made this tree even more attractive. Nvidia also predicted it'll grow even more bananas ($11 billion in sales) in the future.\r  \n\r  \nAs a result, many other banana trees in the chipmaking part of the jungle have also grown bigger. However, not all trees have been so fortunate.

By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.\\n\\nToday, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-ge\"",

To understand AI market I follow real experts like Ilya Sutskever (OpenAI), who said and I quote \u201cit turned out that they make a lot more GPUs than TPUs [or specialized chips] so it's cheaper to train on GPUs.\u201d Google has thousands of engineers working on software and hardware around their TPU. If anyone is going to take market share from Nvidia, it will be Google, not Tesla. Cathie is full of shit and talking her own book."

But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of \\'ideas\\' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past.

I started when I was 18, in 2020, I am 21 now. During those first couple of years, market went wild. I missed seemingly every opportunity.\n\nBut one thing I realized. The opportunities kept coming, and will keep coming. First next gen tech, then EV, then crypto, then rotation out of tech, now back to tech, and AI. \n\nThere is no shortage of opportunities in this world. If you keep your eyes open for the next opportunity, instead of reflecting on the past and what you missed, you will find it. This is a mistake people often make. They chase after trains that have already departed not seeing the new one arrive at the station. \n\n\nArtificial Intelligence is just getting started. I always was bummed I wasn\u2019t alive or old enough during the early days of the internet, because that seemed like a generational wealth creation opportunity I missed. \n\nAnd then came ChatGPT. I now know a second wealth creation opportunity has arrived. \n\nI believe the best companies in the AI space have yet to even form! People forget Amazon IPO\u2019d late into the tech bubble, 1997 I believe. Maybe the next great AI company is still under construction. But keep your eyes out instead of reflecting on the past. \n\n\nOne final word about Nvidia- nothing intrisntic about the business changed, the arrival of ChatGPT changed the company\u2019s outlook. It was getting (unfairly) beat down in 2022 , no one saw ChatGPT coming unless you worked in the space. \n\n\nGood luck investing."

     "Tech will continue to outperform all other sectors.\n\nI've heard people call tech a bubble in the entirety of the past decade and more. (You have encountered them).\n\nThe people who always try to convince you that the fall of tech is just around the corner, that perhaps another - unknown stock - will lead the next decade. (You have encountered them).\n\nThese people are the same people who hate on people who buy Nvidia 4090 GPUs. They know what's the best of class product or stock, but don't want other people to enjoy the gains if they don't have it (crabs in a bucket).\n\nBeware these people, as they can sound convincing and once you accept their (tech bubble) ideas, you may also become one of these people after you miss out on gains.\n\nIt's better to **keep it simple.** Tech revenue is growing at high double digits, that means their outperformance is still intact as no other sector is growing so. Debating over whether the stock should be 25 or 35 PE is meaningless, because double digit growth changes PE ratios quickly.\n\nFor example, MSFT's EPS is 2.5x higher than it was just 4 years ago. It might be hard to appreciate 20% in one year, but it adds up. That means 35 PE becomes 14 PE in just 4 years.\n\nIf you buy tech at a local peak and it goes down, like it did in 2020 and 2022, you're supposed to average down. MSFT Azure was growing at 46% this time last year despite the falling share price. They are opportunities and not \"aha tech bubble\" moments."

I guess I have a similar story where I was gonna buy a whole Bitcoin back in June of 2020 when it was roughly 5k but backed out because I thought it was too risky lol. I also wanted to buy a thousand dollars worth of Tesla back in March 2020 when it was roughly 300 bucks a share (pre split). I decided not to invest in it because someone who I had known who had a lot of experience investing in the stock market told me not to. This was also my very first time putting any money in the stock market, and I was extremely hesitant about putting my hard earned money into something I essentially thought was a gamble.If anything this experience taught me that you just gotta follow your gut when it comes to everything in life including investing lol."

It is in Nvidia's interest to give the Chinese government the impression that Intel is a viable foundry replacement for TSM. \n\nBecause if the Chinese believe that:\n \n1. TSM is the only foundry capable of producing top-of-the-line GPUs.\n2. NVIDIA is prohibited from selling the cutting edge GPUs to China.\n3. Such GPUs are capable of giving the west an advantage in not just economics, but in warfare (e.g. weather system predictions), weapons (missile design and guidance), cyber warfare, or even biological warefare.\n\nThen the conclusion is that they *MUST* attack Taiwan soon to stop the disparity. However, if China has the impression that Intel can somewhat replace TSM (not completely but even partially), then such an attack is less attractive as it would be like cutting 3 heads off a 5 head hydra.\n\nAlso, I'm sure Nvidia would love for Intel to catch up. Even though Nvidia has a terrific relationship with TSM, having more foundries closer to home (and further away from Chinese missiles) is a net gain for Nvidia."

     "Is time to recover this gem written by Peter Lynch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You\u2019ll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*\r  \n\r  \n*A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that\u2019s been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald\u2019s was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald\u2019s could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with McDonald\u2019s. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*\r  \n\r  \n*And if McDonald\u2019s was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot\u2019s company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*\r  \n\r  \n*If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you\u2019d just be breaking even today.*\r  \n\r  \n*I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: \u201cDue to the recent bankruptcy, we\u2019re removing this stock from our buy list.\u201d In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I\u2019ve ever seen before or since.*\r  \n\r  \n*You often hear about companies whose future performance is \u201cdiscounted\u201d in the stock price. If that\u2019s the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*\r  \n\r  \n*When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64\u2014though nowhere near as extreme as EDS\u2019s. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It\u2019s a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon\u2019s earnings didn\u2019t grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18\u215d in 1974.*\r  \n\r  \n*The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*\r  \n\r  \n*The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14\u215b in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid\u2019s p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*\r  \n\r  \n*Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn\u2019t have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*"

If you have any friends or relatives in Taiwan, they can tell you how bad the situation has become over the past few years. US investors are seriously underestimating the probability of China\u2019s interference in Taiwan. It\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s a matter of when. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re going to have a full-on invasion, they are going to be much more surgical than that. There will be a bold move they make soon and it will be a minsky moment where US investors assign a non-zero chance that TSMC could be at risk in the future.

Here's some bullet points of why:\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nCovid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.\r  \n\r  \nAI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.\r  \n\r  \nHigh Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.\r  \n\r  \nInsider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years. The worst is that the CFO is now doing it which is the one person in the company that knows best about valuations.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want more details you can watch my video on YouTube by searching 'NVDA TickerTaco'."

Therefore, I'd rather throw $10k at a gamble like this with 300-1000% upside if it works, than throw $50k at puts that expire 6-12 months from now with 50-200% upside. I know I'm simplifying the greeks drastically, but the essence is that if timing is impossible, might as well risk less capital for higher upside potential. If the first $10k position blows up, this gives me the opportunity to sit back, relax, and wait to potentially reload another position in the near future.\n\nWhereas if I got the entry price wrong for a larger, deeper put - they will have lost 30-60% of their value anyway. From a psychology perspective, it's much easier for me to dismiss a smaller position loss and cut my chasing rather than hoping for my large, bleeding position to recoup it's value. Waiting for deep OTM puts to recover is mentally exhausting and draining."

Intel's cash flows are gone, and at the current state of things, this whole \"Intel will dominate the chip manufacturing business\" is pure speculation, which is the reason why Intel's share price is where it is.\n\nAn investment is favourable when the best case scenario makes you a lot of money, whereas the worst-case scenario does not make you end up with a substantial permanent loss of capital. You do you, of course, but in my opinion, Intel does not provide such balance right now."

They have to protect their moat and have to convince people to use them as a foundry\u2026.how will they compete but on cost?\n\n5-  Do you even understand how many graphics chips are needed to run AI?  The growth is tremendous and Intel has no products in this space\u2026. In fact do you know Intel discrete graphics cards are run on tsmc chips?\n\n6- This post makes me want to \ud83e\udd22 \ud83e\udd2e.

It's a one man show with NVIDIA right now and later this year AMD offering their own MI100 chips. And yeah those comments from Nvidia were certainly encouraging for Intel but that doesn't mean the pickaxes will be fabbed in the US rather than Taiwan and South Korea - though Intel getting up to the standard that they can even be used by NVDA as a bargaining chip to haggle for lower prices with TSMC is a good sign for them.\n\nLastly the margins for them making other companies AI chips will be lower than the margins for those actually designing and selling them. Again Intel is far behind in designing it's own AI chips.\n\n100% agree with you that NVDA is way overpriced though."

NVDA's technology and infrastructure will be key to developing these custom large language models specifically for NOW platform.  \\n\\n\\nServiceNow already has some AI features, but this new partnership could introduce more uses for generative AI across the enterprise. It sounds like this could make a big difference to IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers by strengthening workflow automation and quickly increasing productivity.  \\n\\n\\nIt also seems like NOW will be using this new AI tech to help NVIDIA improve its own IT operations.They're working on various applications o\"",

Steadily rising ROIC, stable and high revenue growth, founder still involved, considered critical infrastructure by many of their clients, 98% gross retention rate, etc.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in AI companies though I feel like Tesla is the most overlooked opportunity in the space. They are the farthest ahead in real world AI. Meaning AI that actually interacts with the real world and isn\u2019t just text based. If they manage to solve FSD not only will that save lives but it will transfer over to Optimus which itself has a massive TAM. It\u2019s amazing what the bot is already able to do comparing 2021 when it was first revealed to now. And it will be very cheap to produce and scale. It\u2019s probably atleast 10 years out from this of course but the opportunity alone makes tesla a great one to take a bet on in the AI space"

Companies very often get complacent when they are market leaders (see Oracle, IBM, Intel recently).\n\nAMD was never lured to fight much Nvidia on the peanuts of the gaming market, they never made any money on pc GPU, but this may change with AI. Intel too has recently started competing.\n\nPoint is: what really matters to customers of those GPUs eventually is how much computing power they get for their money. There's different models and different software out there.\n\nAnybody expecting Nvidia to dominate without a competition for a decade clearly does not understand the complexity of long term dominance in tech which is very hard to obtain and maintain."

     "With the pump after hours the stock is still down over 35% from its all time high and yet its still incredibly overvalued. I remember arguing with u/apooroldinvestor back in November who was convinced this company would never go below $300.00 a share and I will say what I said then. This stock is the very definition of a bubble. \n\nThe valuation is absolutely egregious no matter what metrics you use. The company is priced beyond perfection. The company is trading over a 500 BILLION DOLLARS! That is about the same size if you were to take all the biggest semi-conductors like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instrument\u2019s, and Broadcom together and combined them! In what world does this make any sense to anybody? \n\nOn top of trading at high multiples they had earnings declines which a company priced to over perfection should not exist period. This company has a lot more to fall before I even consider touching it. Right now the only thing moving this stock is pure speculation cause its for sure not the fundamentals that is moving it. This stock is completely disconnected from any fundamentals. Up over 50% in just 2 months. \n\nNo thank you, staying away. I am leaving this to you u/apooroldinvestor and the other Nvidia fanboys."

     "I\u2019m not an expert in market mechanics but I can think of some who would buy calls after a massive gain:\n\n1. People who think the price will still increase the day before or the day of expiry (in NVDA\u2019s case, most contracts are expiring tomorrow. That\u2019s two full days of the price potentially increasing post-earnings. \n2. People who plan to exercise the contract.\n3. Naked Put Sellers\n4. Market Makers for Delta Hedging\n5. Scalpers\n\nProbably many more reasons why, but remember the price of the option is directly related to the price of the underlying so if you bought a call for $80 that was $8 the day prior, the only reason it\u2019s now worth $80 the day before expiration is because it\u2019s intrinsic value is close to $80.\n\nAlso, for every buyer, there is a seller and vice-versa. The person who sold the call either sold it naked in the first place, or they had the 100 shares of the underlying in their account in case it\u2019s exercised. Market makers will generally buy/sell to provide liquidity and to earn some change off the spread."

     "After the price run up, some people and hedge fund algorithms are trying to find the right prices for a put/call straddle that pays off with enough volatility. For example, tomorrow, NVDA is likely to be volatile, whether it moves up or down. If it closes at the same price, then that would be a seemingly unlikely event. \n\nYou are supposed to be able to exactly calculate the values of puts and calls for a long straddle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model\n\nHowever, you need to know the volatility to be able to calculate the prices. What volatility are you going to use? The volatility from the last 5 minutes? 5 years? All time? What is the drift? How do you define the drift? These problems are hard, but it doesn't stop some hedge funds from making money sometimes. Some hedge funds also lose World-Economy-Shattering sums of money. Some of the people who made the model won the Nobel prize for economics and then almost crashed world markets trading in Russia, saying that it was a sigma-six, infinitesimally improbable event and that no one could know that the value of the ruble would collapse. But that's not true at all. Even assuming Gaussian distributions for price volatility is only a first-order approximation on a distribution that may be skewed or have long tails. \n\nSo basically some economists pretended to solve a problem by sweeping undefined variables under the rug. But, if you have an estimate of volatility and drift, you can play games with puts and calls, and your estimates will be good some of the time. That's one reason why so many shares are traded by algorithms."

     "It's hard to say what Nvidia should be valued at.\n\nThere are people who point at NVDA's 130 PE.\n\nBut when that 130 PE came from 2022 which included the following: 2.17bn inventory charges, china chip ban, 1.35bn arm termination fee, change to proof of stake destroying crypto mining (NVDA's 'gaming' revenue which was cut in half), worldwide poor macro conditions (rate hikes + inflation) leading to companies and consumers cutting spending where possible, gaming GPU is one of the first to be cut in the personal budget\n\nI'm sure I could be forgetting a few things but I would not use 2022 as an indicator of the future given the above are either one-off events (termination fees and write downs which added back brings NVDA's PE to 70) or factors outside of NVDA's control (chip ban and interest hikes)\n\nTheir recent massive rally can be justified depending on whether the AI boom will fuel NVDA sales in the long term which is highly speculative.\n\nThere's also the scenario that AI does take off, but their large customers develop their own chips. \n\n'Gaming' alone will never justify their market cap, that's why they're chasing the corporate money.\n\nThe reason I've personally been holding for a long time is:\n\n1. One of the very few if not the only mega tech company still run by the founder who is also an engineer. MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META and GOOGL all became massive in their fields under the leadership of their founders.\n\n2. History shows that while there are failures, the investors who hit  at home-run 100x bagger are the ones who held AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA when their futures were NOT certain and the valuations were NOT 10-20 PE. AMZN was always (still is) unprofitable or trading at insane PE ratios, yet that didn't stop them from being a great investment. When TSLA when burning cash and their survival was in question, that was the time where an investor hit it 100x. AAPL once had triple digit PE before the massive iPhone profits came in. MSFT was before my time but who invested in the 80s or early 90s when a PC in every home was NOT the norm, nor was it inevitable it would be the norm.\n\n3. While it paid for earlier NVDA investors, and some think it's too late (it may be too late) I remember people thinking AAPL half a trillion market cap was too late. People who invested when AAPL was the biggest company in the world a decade ago were rewarded with 1000%+ return when including dividends.\n\nThere is speculative upside and downside, always will be, but I think long term investors ought to be optimists just seeing how companies continue to surprise in how much innovation (and profits) they can deliver. Name ANY tech company today and they ALL had doubters as they climbed."

MSFT, GOOG also benefits from AI but given their wide products and diversified business, just feel this will limit their growth.\\n\\nTesla is also a good option for growth, but its CEO just too unpredictable, and Tesla has lots of competitors while Nvidia has strong moat for both software CUDA and hardware.\\n\\nThe only question is that, should I buy at $278? The price seems bubble to me given their recent earning report and entire economic environment.'",

Nvidias market cap is 686 billion dollars. CUDA is definitely the dominant backend but at that valuation it has to stay that way forever. What specifically caused this spike in market cap? Large language models. What if there is specialized hardware developed for these that does not need a general purpose GPU? How many firms are going to deploy these models and how many GPUs will they buy? Is crypto mining going to be hot in a 5% risk free environment? Will the Nintendo Switch 2 increase revenues? \n\nI think a lot of good news and perfect execution has been priced in so I\u2019m not bullish at the current price. That being said the final step I like to take in my analysis is to inverse my opinion as I am usually critically wrong about something. So my final answer is hyper bullish."

The valuation is difficult to justify at this point unless you basically assume the bull case.\n\nIt could do fine, but it's hard to see how it would be a huge relative winner from here. You'd probably need to be betting on the macro (in which case why NVDA?) or the AI hype accelerating further.\n\nOtherwise there seems to be a lot of down side risk near-term. Demand obviously isn't great right now. and it's not clear how long that will last, the AI hype might be overplayed near-term, and the valuation is currently stretched.\n\nLong-term I worry more about competition. Investors pay a premium for NVDA because of its dominant position in AI, and while I'm not going to claim I'm an expert in this space, from what I've read there's a reason to think others like AMD and maybe INTC could erode their marketshare with time. Believers will tell you, \"it will never happen!\", but it's amazing how much disruption and change can in a decade in tech.\n\nMy personal view is sell, take the gain and look for an attractive reentry price. I think NVDA is going to be volatile with large swings up and down, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price is only slightly higher than it is today in 5 years."

     "The size of the GPU market globally is just not large enough to justify their current valuation. All this AI hype has people thinking it\u2019s going to explode, but it\u2019s oversold. The Cloud boom was driving a lot of that, especially from the heavy hitters like Microsoft, Meta, and Google. Their cloud growth is slowing down, and those companies already have a shit ton of GPU capacity. Frankly AMD (with their Xilinx acquisition) could end up being positioned better than Nvidia for AI workloads. You\u2019re almost assuredly going to see an AMD FPGA integrated directly into a 2nm CPU die, directly into a GPU die, or perhaps a dedicated AI system build, with multiple low nm FPGA\u2019s on the motherboard along with multiple GPUs. FPGA\u2019s are also very futureproof, as by definition they are reprogrammable. At some point it\u2019s conceivable that ML model structure will shift, such that GPU\u2019s become significantly slower than FPGA\u2019s or ASIC\u2019s due to design efficiencies gained by directly constructing circuits to run or train specific ML architectures.\n\nCrypto continuing to move to proof of stake will continue to shrink that market segment also.\n\nAlso, their consumer GPU\u2019s could already hit 90fps at 4K on the previous generation (3xxx series), so there is very little need to upgrade to a 4xxx.\n\nToo many uncertainties (for me) to justify a ~600B valuation, on what\u2019s looking like a ~$4bn profit year in 2023. That\u2019s like a 150x P/E, in the face of those headwinds/risks, plus recession and overall equity risk\u2026 Oh also, Biden banned their top end AI chips to the 2nd biggest market, China."

  "Text": "b\"After reaching a valuation of more than $800 billion in late 2021, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares fell sharply -- intermittently by as 70% from the all-time high. With that frame of reference, Nvidia's fundamentals were pressured by a slowdown in gaming, crypto-mining and the broader personal computer market. However, on the backdrop of the ChatGPT tailwind, NVDA stock has started to rebound aggressively, reflecting investor optimism about the potential of generative AI technology.\\n\\nWhile I acknowledge the tailwind that Nvidia is likely to see from AI computing, I also argue that the thesis remains speculative, given the early stages of the technology. Moreover, investors should consider that the market is already pricing lots of optimism--with NVDA shares valued at a FWD EV/EBIT of close to x60.\\n\\nNvidia is scheduled to report Q4 2022 earnings on February 22nd, and I assign a 'Hold' rating pre-announcement.\"",

Still good though, because most people don't take anything more than gaming or crytpto mining performance into account.\n\nTheir CPUs are amazing and they're slowly chipping away at Intel's absolute dominance in enterprise systems. \n\nNvidia is also a blind buy. Some people probably think they're the only GPU manufacturer that exists. They are the absolute best of the best in GPUs, which isn't hard since  there's only 2 lol\n\nIntel is making GPUs now too,but they're garbage and will stay garbage for I'm guessing 3 generations before they are seriously competing in the mid range. I have no clue when they'd be fighting with Nvidia for #1, but it's gonna happen at some point. \n\nEven though their CPUs aren't beating AMD by a landslide anymore, they still have a massive amount of market share and can easily make CPUs that don't use more energy than a thermal reactor. \n\nIts definitely worth looking at other companies like Qualcomm and Samsung as well, but I'd say these 3 are worth blind buying.

Their margins will compress and they will become commoditized. They will be around, but not as high margin businesses. \n\nINTC: Margins will continue to shrink. -Consumer: Apple moved to own chips, PC providers will likely have ARM-based chips from one or more vendors.\n\n-Data Center: Cloud providers moving to their own chips (e.g. Graviton for AWS, likely MS and Google are designing their own server chips). RISCV is also coming up.\n\n-AI chips: NVIDIA dominates, but cloud providers are also designing their own (TPU, Inferentia, Trainium, \u2026).  Also 100+ AI startups\n\n-Other business units are too small and highly competitive and low margin\n\n-Behind TSMC in manufacturing, custom foundry remains to be seen. Intel tried it before and failed, foundry is fundamentally a different business style than Intel is used to. Intel\u2019s manufacturing unit has always had a captive customer (x86), now needs to fight for customers.\n\nIntel will survive, but as a shell of itself. Margins will be much lower, company will be much smaller, and revenues not grow fast. \n\nI think similar fate will also fall on AMD and NVIDIA."

Hold shares, drip divs into SMH and buy puts insurance going into earnings.\n\nAMD is solid, high growth, high margins in a good subsector of the semiconductor industry (B2B server and HPC). It's a buy under 85, valuation isn't insane.\n\nNVDA is overpriced and their growth doesn't justify the price. Good buy once crypto has fully gone into a freeze.

     "Interesting you don't include Qualcomm.  Intel By far is my armchair pick.  But I think investing in all 3 is solid moves. \n\nNvidia -  Grew because of Crypto.  Now they have to make the right investments and gambles again.  Unless Nvidia creates dedicated crypto chip/PCIE-card, and crypto has growth again, I don't expect them to have that explosive growth again.  That said their Full stack approach (software, UI, AI, verse, GPU), as well as server adoption puts it in a really good place for sustain and future.  This also allows them to do a software licensing to offset hardware costs.  I think they are making great investments.  The main issue is cost for stock price.  They aren't going anywhere. \n\nAMD - AMD is My short term pick.  If you are looking to sell next year, or at least reevaluate, AMD is my pick.  They are eating Marketshare.  They are making investments to get into Enterprise equipment.  They are creating top of line consumer CPUs and dominating low end. And their high end server grade are at least equal footing to Intel, if not better.  Their biggest hurdle is breaking into the trust between intel and companies have had for decades.  Their acquisition of Xilinx is a huge technology advancement. Again, I think they are making good investments, but they don't control fabs, and they don't control end product.  And they are pricey, but I can't fathom them not growing in 2 years. \n\nIntel.  My choice for intel, is it is low risk and high potential.  Which is ideal for stocks.  It is extremely cheap now, but will likely not improve much in the next year.  But they have fab, and plan to sell that fab space for other companies.  This is HUGE.  This is competition with TSMC. And they still have time to get their processes fixed.   They also don't just sell CPU/GPU. They have NICs, Memory, Ethernet, FPGAs.  Which are all small compared to their competitors.  They have the best case for a truly integrated SoC, which is good for servers.  Which they already have trust.   They are investing in GPU, Mobile, both are risky, but could pay off handsomely.   And their stock is cheap with dividends. \n\nThe safest play is ETF in this space.  They are all going to win in some capacity, It is just a matter of who wins more."

Also, stocks are typically reasonably priced because the market doesn\u2019t foresee strong performance over the next year or so.\n\nI really want to love Intel but they just haven\u2019t proven to me that they have fixed their execution problems.

     "I think a lot of people over rate having a fab. Fabs don't make near as much revenue as the main company, Intel is just so massive they could afford it but AMD could technically buy back their spin off company global foundries and bring it up to speed. What is the real issue here is what company has room to grow and has demonstrated this yearly. It's AMD, it competes in a growing sector of sales and more and more compute farms come online daily with big big companies like AWS and Google buying high margin server parts as fast as they can be made. In the past AMD had something as low as 5% market share and Intel has 90% while now AMD has 20 and Intel 70 roughly. This shows in a big way in the company's revenue. The last factor I will mention is Intel pays dividends but AMD only does buy backs and is slated for an increase from 1bil to 8bil buy backs for the coming year. This pretty much means the company is signaling which of the categories it falls into. The AMD execs quote 20% growth and I honestly believe them. I believe them so much that I passed an Intel RnD job that I would have loved for a lower paying position at AMD. I had a research project they sponsored at my uni but also had an AMD internship previously and weighed my options to end up here.\n\nAlso a last word, I don't think either company is going anywhere and I think Intel has so much promise in emerging technology and fabrication. Nvda I don't know enough about but I will say ... With new AI accelerating units and integrated graphics as well as a potential rework of crypto ... I'm not as sold."

The graphics behemoths from California were considered the technical leaders. But on Friday, the US market leader ended the decades-long relationship with a bang.\\nEVGA speaks openly about how frustrated the card manufacturers are with Nvidia's business practices. First there were no chips available for months, now the manufacturers' warehouses are suddenly full with cards that will be obsolete in just a few weeks. EVGA claims to currently make a loss with every graphics card sold. Nvidia dictated prices and quantities for months and thus got its hardware partners into trouble.\\nSo.. What is your opinion about that? Nvidia and the future.\"",

Wasnt sure how it would end up but kept buying. Now the portfolio is breaking new all time highs every week. \\n\\nIm sure heavy Nvidia and Tesla investors are feeling good too. \\n\\nCheers everyone, lets hope the run up can keep going!'",

  "Text": "b'https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-activision-deal-eu-approves-takeover-of-call-of-duty-maker.html\\n\\nEuropean Union regulators on Monday approved Microsofts proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EUs executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europes green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.s top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsofts acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giants own platforms. Activision is behind so'",

     "I think they could be attractive but what worries me is that the risk profile of companies like TSM, AMD and NVDA have now completely changed.\n\nNow the US is putting restrictions on US chip exports to China we could see China getting more proactive in securing their claim to Taiwan in a move to gain some leverage against US sanctions. The more the US tries to restrict tech and semi exports to China the less China has to loose taking actions like blockading Taiwan.\n\nRealistically this status-quo will not hold and something is going to happen over the next decade, that's unlikely to be a full invasion in my opinion, but China can still apply extreme pressure on Taiwan if it's in the interest of their national security. And make no mistake, securing access to cutting-edge semis is absolutely essential to the national security of both the US and China.\n\nWhat worries me about buying any of these companies is that that there are now significant geopolitically tail risks here in which these companies could drop significantly more overnight. Plus arguably semi stocks like AMD, NVDA and TSM are all extremely expensive relative to the rest of the market already. The risk/reward seems skewed towards very positive returns (assuming the status-quo holds), or extremely negative (assuming geopolitically tensions increase).\n\nIf you want a small position just for some exposure, then fair enough, but I wouldn't take out a big position in any of these companies unless they drop more."

Certain areas (cars, datacentre) will still have high demand, but others (PC, gaming, crypto) are in huge surplus right now.

Even now Nvidia has a forward p/e of 34 with a forward peg of 1.58 - it is still overvalued and this will get worse  if earnings reduce further.\n\nFinally - great company does not equal great stock."

     "\"It's taken a dump\" depends on your perspective.\n\nWe can all agree that tech stock prices were massively inflated at the November 21 peak. Nvidia broke $340 and I don't even remember how high their P/E ratio was. (*edit: their P/E in Oct 2021 was 79*) The crypto market was breaking ATH's like crazy and their GPU's were selling like crazy.\n\nBy October 22 it almost dropped to $100 due to revenue decreases and macroeconomic conditions but it still bounced back to $160 within a month. That's not a bad jump.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nNvidia is a great company. They will definitely grow in the coming years and I expect the price to go up long term and maybe even break it's previous ATH if the economy recovers (which it probably will at some point). However, I'm bearish short term as I can see their revenue growth declining sharply mainly due to less demand for their GPUs and ofc due to recession. \n\nMy position:\n\nI'm short on Nvidia for a few days. My opinion of course could be completely false and my stop losses trigger by Thursday and I'll probably reconsider my trading skills (which are average at best). \n\nIf someone has more to add or disagree, I would appreciate any input."

The question will be what multiple the market gives to their EPS and growth rate. I don't know if they will reach the same multiple they had last year unless we see more QE inflating market multiples, but I think it is going to be very easy for them to top their ATH within 5 years with a much lower multiple than before.

Not any time soon IMO. We may see north of 200 after the end of  the tightening cycle, and we go back to easy money, but that will be in 5 years or more.\n\nWhat happens to the stock depends on the growth story that nvidia puts forward. Can nvidia justify having an inflated P/E? Right now, no.\n\nI say this as someone holding 100 shares of nvidia at 240$. I would not have paid 240$ for nvidia; it was a gamble on a put that bit me when Brainard came out overly hawkish early in the year, and the stock tanked over 60$ in a day. Due to some life issues I was unable to buy back the put before it was assigned. I have been contemplating selling since, but kept selling CCs on the rallies. I am still thinking of selling, since the downside potential of nvidia right now could easily put it under 100$/share for years.\n\nShort term -> Downside to less than 100$/share.\n\nMedium term -> May go back up after easy money cycle resumes.

     "Crypto is actually a less impactful segment to Nvidia\u2019s revenue stream than it was just a few years ago. Crypto makes up approximately 2% of their current revenue. \n\nThey\u2019ve been shifting focus heavily toward data center and AI. Gaming is still a large contributor to their revenue stream, and will continue to be meaningful, but you can\u2019t use current gaming revenue figures interchangeably with crypto. \n\nPeople here saying crypto is the reason Nvidia is going down are entitled to their opinion, but I think that\u2019s misleading. Sure, crypto is a part of it because it impacts investor sentiment (as evident by this thread), but a bigger part of it is macro supply chain issues, China\u2019s restricted economy, higher interest rates and yields, and concerns of a recessionary environment weighing on the chip sector.\n\nTL;DR Crypto only makes up 2% of Nvidia\u2019s current revenue; making dramatic price target calls on Nvidia\u2019s crypto revenue is probably the wrong way to look at it. \n\nCheers to everyone and good luck if you own shares!

When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear."

The US Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges and a settlement with the company today. Its order claims Nvidia misled investors by reporting a huge boost in revenue related to gaming, hiding how much its success relied on the far more volatile crypto market. Nvidia isnt admitting to wrongdoing as part of the settlement, but it agrees to stop any unlawful failures to disclose information.\\n\\nThe charges stem from Nvidias fiscal year 2018 financial reports. The SEC notes Nvidia saw an explosion in crypto mining-related sales in 2017, when the rewards of mining Ethereum grew dramatically. Crypto mining was widely reported as a cause of GPU scarcity, and Nvidia launched a separate CMP line spec'",

For 500,000 EVs that would be 2 Million Chips.\n\nIf each Orin Chip brings NVDA $400 (Have NO idea if this is even close to being correct)\n\nThat would bring NVDA $800 Million just from NIO compared to NVDA current annual Automotive business of $566 Million\n\nSo that would be huge.

This has already started.  Future growth should  come from gamers who skipped the 3000 series, render farms, datacenters buying gpu compute and general ai gpu requirements. All this makes NVIDA a long term part of the tech fabric that use everyday. I, for my part, remain bullish."

It's likely gonna hit at some point later this summer because Google hit a similar area of demand (and it took off faster in 2021, so NVDA is likely behind on this).\n\nDisclosure: I hold AVGO/AMAT but I'm thinking about making it AVGO and ASML.\n\nI've said so elsewhere and will say it again...I think a large reason why the inverse Cramer stuff has worked extra well this year is because this is the worst that the Nasdaq has been since 2008 (even if it's nowhere near that on a percentage basis) and a lot of what he likes is large cap tech. Yes, there's other stuff, but large cap tech is a lot of it.\n\nSo, you pretty much could've just gone SQQQ and done great. I did it once on a feeling and sold too early because frankly, the fact there was multiple -100 + days was a major shock for me (which tbh, I THINK that's gone until July because quarterly OPEX is hedged up big time, and I think some of what was seen in May was major fund liquidations)."

Given the market we're in I'm seeing lots of reasons why investors might want to be a little more cautious on the near-term outlook for NVDA, but so far this hasn't been fully reflected in the stock price. It's possible NVDA will keep going up, but it could also easily fall 50% from here should we see a larger shift in investor sentiment.\n\nIt's probably a great company to own long-term, but at the current valuation you risk being underwater for a year or two before seeing any returns."

     "They are not really similar. Nvidia designs chips for  GPUs and for AI applications. They recently entered the data center market. Nvidia doesn\u2019t make their own chips, but have a contract with TSMC to make chips for them. \n\nIntel designs and makes chips for clients (laptops and desktops), data centers and recently entered the discrete GPU market. They are also expanding into the foundry business, meaning they will make chips for other customers. They also own Mobileye, which is expected to IPO this year or next. \n\nBefore you buy either of the two stocks, I would advise that you learn more about the companies, and their financial performance. Intel for example, has been a dividend stock for a while, but they are going to have a negative cash flow for the first time in decades to fund their foundry business. As a result, the stock may not do well for the next couple of years till Wall Street sees tangible results.\n\nNvidia on the other hand has been growing very quickly the last couple of years, but there are strong signs that the music is about to stop with an oversupply of GPUs and chips in general. The problem with growth stocks is that the multiple completely collapses once the growth slows down, so there is a significant risk of that in the short to medium term."

But something to consider...chips are very cyclical and don't necessarily do great in a recession environment. Plus, PC sales may be slowing tremendously. This may already be priced into both of these stocks. I would guess that there won't be much upside to either of them for a bit, at least through earnings, but at least with Intel you get paid 4% to wait. AMD is really taking market share from Intel though so there is some risk that Intel continues to lose market share. Assuming you can, I'd also look into Taiwan Semis."

     "First off Ethereum mining is finished so everybody who bought GPU(s) or ASICs to mine are in a dilemma whether they should sell their hardware or look for another coin which can be mined profitable.\n\nImagine regular gamers buying multiple graphics cards (sometimes dozens) just to mine because they heard it it's profitable, and this was from 2020 until now. And imagine big mining farms where you can find hundreds or even thousands of graphics cards, this was from \\~2017. You can google it, just take a look at some of those pictures.\n\nAbout 95% of the mining-power (hashrate) was mining Ethereum so all the other GPU-minable coins combined can't \"absorb\" all of this calculation-capacity so these other coins became unprofitable overnight for most of these people (unless they have very-very cheap or free electricity).\n\nSo back to the article it's not just this mining pool but about 80+% of all miners (based on calculations) will probably look to sell their hardware on the second hand market in the coming weeks/months and all this worth about between $5B and $15B, it depends on who you ask, it's between 10 and 30 million graphics cards.\n\nAlso Nvidia inventory is full of new RTX 30xx cards right now that's why they choose to introduce in October only the high-end RTX 40xx cards first because they're much faster than the fastest 30xx card the 3090 Ti so they don't have in-house competition.\n\nThe prices of second hand market will push down the new market prices because that's how supply and demand works, if I buy a used card because it's really cheap then I'm no longer looking for a new card. So I'm pretty sure their gaming revenue and margin will go even lower in this year.\n\nI'm not sure how this will affect the stock price because in one hand the Ethereum Merge is very old news, whoever is serious about looking after their investment should've known about this for months. On the other hand Jensen Huang always downplayed the effect of mining on the company.\n\nThey expect the revenue to drop to $5.9B in Q3 (down from $6.7B in Q2), they told us that their inventory levels are high so this is already priced in. But they didn't mention anything about the second hand market after the Ethereum Merge in their earnings call.\n\nI would say it's not impossible that we will see something like what we've seen in 2018, maybe in a smaller scale because the stock is already down 60% from the top."

Otherwise, you simply cant compete with the breadth of software already available on x86/AMD64. With batteries improving rapidly, we might reach the point where high efficiency wont matter and everyone will look for horsepower again.\n\nWe have seen all this before even within x86 generations. We have also see it in other sectors. When energy is expensive, people switch to efficient. When energy is cheap, they no longer care and just look for best performance.\n\nSo im thinking that depending on how battery tech advances the next 5 years, its possible ARM goes out the window, and ironically, WinTel makes a comeback on.... smartphones.... wouldnt that be something?

     "As someone who\u2019s been watching all 3 recently, here\u2019s my take on what will happen.\n\n1. Apple - at a near ATH (less than 7% off), which is similar to S&P500. Heck, they were at ATH just last week. I find the growth in Apple to be in short spurts. It tends to boom up, then trade sideways for a while. I think we\u2019re gonna go sideways for a bit with Apple, especially with general market weakness. While Apple is a great company, its had a hell of a boom recently (tripled in value over last 2 years). Long term, it will go up I\u2019m sure. But I might trade sideways for a while before then.\n\n2. NVDA - Quite a bit off their ATH currently, but also not quite at their bottom I don\u2019t think. I could see them going to 200, maybe a bit less with poor market stability. Their P/E is still incredibly optimistic compared to the rest of the field. In order to maintain their P/E over the next two years, they\u2019d grow 50%. It holds a high PEG value too, (2.92), meaning it is relatively overvalued even accounting for its growth. I think it definitely can go up, but I think it\u2019s actually pretty fairly priced where it\u2019s at. \n\n3. AMD has taken a brutal beating recently. It\u2019s about 60% off it\u2019s ATH. It would need to increase 50% y/y to match its projected growth by 2024. Its PEG ratio is under 1, indicating it\u2019s a buy. AMD is currently sitting at a 6 month low. It hasn\u2019t been valued lower than 100 per share since July 2021. Since this valuation, which is before Semi\u2019s really took off in Q4, AMD has acquired Xilinx, acquired another (albeit smaller) company, announced a 8bil buyback while completing nearly 3 billion of their last announcement. What this tells me, is that AMD is so confident in their company and they think they\u2019re undervalued, so they\u2019re buying up their own stock with free cash to potentially resell later or improve valuation.\n\nOf these 3, the greatest short play is AMD. It has the highest opportunity to increase 50% y/y. Next would be NVIDIA. Ideal growth at 25% y/y. Finally Apple, which I would be impressed with a growth rate of 15% y/y.\n\nI think the riskiest play, at this point, is actually NVIDIA. They\u2019ve been really overvalued for a long time, despite their market dominance. With greater market competition, they may struggle in the years to come. AMD is in the same boat, but just more undervalued across the board, and therefore has less room to fall. Apple is by far the safest play, I would say. But that doesn\u2019t mean a 20% drop couldn\u2019t happen over the next few months.\n\nDisclaimer: I hold substantial amounts of all three stocks listed for close to two years now. My biggest position is in AMD, for the reasons I listed."

     "You should recognise that although Google represents itself as a technology company, by revenue, it's an advertising company. About 80% of its revenue. I can't find what percentage of that is from paid search, but I imagine it's quite large.\n\nThe search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.\n\nNow go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.\n\nGoogle can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.\n\nSo I think google is going to face serious headwinds in terms of their core revenue drivers. They will survive, but its going to be painful. They got complacent. The tortoise overtook the hare while he was resting on his laurels."

     "I'm seeing many already established, often outlandishly high P/E companies here that would have been a good investment some time ago.\n\nFull Disclosure: I own shares in the company that I will now briefly talk about. I consider it a great investment right now (I'm not responsible for any losses).\n\nWestlake Chemical Corporation (WCC). First let us talk about past performance and financial metrics. WCC over the last 10 years has shown a 10 year median return of ROE of 21,4% and a ROIC of 14,5%. When one considered the ROIC it seems like a company that seems rather cyclical and is rather sensitive to major crisis (ROIC 2008=-1.67% and 2019/20= +3-4%). That 14,5% is with the years of corona included. So the upside is a generally high ROIC, but a high variance of the ROIC. The company has been profitable 19 out of the last 20 years (with the year of unprofitability being the banking crisis in 2008). So the return side looks solid, even if I'd rather have less cyclicality.\nLet us consider the growth. The story here is similar. 10-year average growth rates are 16% for revenue, 19,7% on assets, 26,2% of FCF and 19,7% for EPS. It is nice that ROE is mostly greater than the growth rates, indicating that the growth is sustainable. This growth also seems not to driven only by aquisitions and the issuence of debt. There have been two aquisitions made and in parts financed by debt in the last 10 years and the business is far from overly leveraged ($4.88B debt and $2.23B cash on hand with a marketcap of $15.1B). The 10 year median margins I do not know enough about to compare to industry standarts, but they seem high with Gross profit margin of 24,4%, EBIT 18.1% and FCF-margin of 11.1%. Maybe someone more knowledgeable about the industry can weigh in here. The company is also buying back shares, even if not at an emormous rate.\n\nAnd all of that for a P/E of 6,8.\n\nTo me that seems like a conservatively run company, by a management that makes sensible and careful business decisions, with good profitability and good growth and low debt. For me this is a \"no-brainer\" stock, although it isn't perfect, which is why i have just recently bought the stock and gave it significant weight in my portfolio. A personal problem is that I do not know enough about plastics and coatings, which is their business, but every other metric checks out for me.\n\nI would be happy to hear any criticism of the company, as it then might improve how I look at companies in the future. Good luck and thanks :)"

When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear."

So there is this whole forward PE lie. The PE is actually much higher with the lower guidance. They do this to rationalize that Q3 and Q4 companies can make it up. Also the excuse gives their investment banks cover to unload saying forward PE lie is low. When Q3 earnings can\u2019t make up the difference then will come the bloodbath.\n\nSo just beware all scams\u2026 but recession like is never priced in until it actually happens"

     "There is also a report that Apple shipped 5-10% more iPhones than expected last quarter, so the truth is somewhere between, most likely.   Though everyone is expecting a lousy quarter and it probably will be, any hint of getting past this by AAPL will send the stock up quite  bit very quickly. Plus, unless you believe Putin will wage war forever even without ammo or soldiers left, and the Fed will continue raising rates long after the economy has slowed down,  this is the time to BUY.  Everything except cryptos or TSLA, the latter because of its ultra high PE which is not justified.\n\nTo me, the real golden goose is AAPL. My Colombian girlfriend's iphone died yesterday and boy did she panic. \"I spend my whole life on that phone, I run my business on that phone, I need a new one now, please send $800\". Then, as I queried her about fixing her old iPhone she ignored me and just bought a new one on credit for the asking price. She couldn't bear to be without it even for a few hours. Therefore, multiple her by a billion and contemplate the reality of today's world.\r  \n\r  \nBesides basic food and survival, the iPhone is the top priority. I have seen homeless people with iPhones. In 2008, at the pits of that crash, I had 250,000 cash and decided to go all in when no one was buying stocks. I had to pick a stock though. I did the same mental math about \"what is the last thing young people will give up even if there is a depression?\" I decided it was the iPhone. I bought AAPl at $15 a share and accumuated more on steep selloffs and now have 55,000 shares. Warren Buffett also added to AAPL's value when he went heavily in, his first tech stock ever. So, in the time period when IO was growing my wealth with AAPL, through ups and downs, gold has been all over the place, cryptos were born, peaked during the covid lockdowns then crashed and now seem likely to die and disappear. and ten years from now if I dont sell any, my AAPL shares will probably be worth around 15 million dollars. So ,let this be a lesson. Want longterm stability and wealth growth? Invest in AAPL, and right now at $139, it is a bargain. No real risk at all."

The FTC complaint is not yet public.\\n\\n* FTC Chair Lina Khan, who was appointed by President Joe Biden to lead the agency shortly after her confirmation to the agency earlier this year, has signaled an interest in more robust antitrust enforcement. \\n\\n* The trial before the FTCs own administrative law judge is set to begin on Aug. 9, 2022.\\n\\nThis is [not wholly a surprise](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-latest-earnings-report-is-nail-in-coffin-for-40-billion-arm-deal-analyst-172042020.html) to people paying attention.

     "Arm is currently owned by Softbank.\n\nSoftbank is listed on the Tokyo exchange.\n\nSoftbank's stock price is down today while the broader Japan index is up.\n\nSoftbank would get around a billion if the acquisition doesn't proceed. \n\nClearly the market doesn't think it's good for Softbank.\n\nTherefore, if anyone has followed acquisitions before - the acquirer stock price goes down and the acquired goes up.\n\nIf this follows the rule, and what we see happen to Softbank, Nvidia's price should actually go up since it follows what tends to happen and it inverses Softbank's position.\n\n\nEDIT: ARM licenses their IP to other companies. They made a total of $300million for 6 months to Sep 30, 2021. \n\nPeople might ask why would NVDA go up?\n\nWell, it's because NVDA has to pay stock + cash to acquire ARM. Some cash would be forfeit, but they don't pay $10bn in cash and 44.37bn in shares (pre-split) which would be worth 56bn right now, and an additional $5bn or 10mil pre-split shares based on ARM meeting performance targets, and that would be worth almost 13bn right now.l\n\nSo NVDA may go up as they're not paying $10bn cash and up to 200mil shares, or over 70bn for ARM. We don't know how much ARM is worth as they're not publicly traded."

It's been slow lately, so probably due for another run up in a year or so.

The stans will hate me for this, but they are rapidly losing their edge (and Elon's attention). Ford Mach E is on par with the model Y. Rivian, Ford and GM all beat them to the punch on a truck. Cybertruck is years behind. The semi is finally coming out in beta. Build quality hasn't improved.

Lots of large, legacy S&P companies valued way higher than they should be, well over a reasonable P/E. Specifically tech companies.\n* Quantum computing will be here shortly too.

     "I would look real estate ADJACENT. It'd be worth it to see which companies are expanding and buying commercial real estate, as any expansion COULD be seen as a sign of growth, or at the very least, a bubble period. If the company continues to do well, you'll see an increase in revenue, which can only be good for investors. If not, you can still hold out maybe an 8 month bubble? I mean, the rising stock price could last longer than that, but usually a company will know within its first year of expansion whether or not that was a sustainable cost, indicative of employee number growth, and the ability to still meet quarterly fiscal goals and market predictions.\nI'd pay close attention to metropolitan real estate, especially. It's a little easier to read about and stay updated on when any expansion like that will be having job openings published in their local news papers, and it's just easier to research that way, as there's just MORE business in metropolitan areas. So, condense your search down to one area that you can track thoroughly and frequently, and I think you have the best chance at finding the stocks that are right for you, instead of trying to follow market trends and analyses.\nYou can take a look at the data, or you can just look around you.

They used this breakthrough to create something called a Large Language Model.\n\nThis type of AI is far from perfect but showing some amazing results.   Google had been holding back as there is a serious safety concerned.\n\nBut Microsoft joining with OpenAI has decided to ignore any safety concerns and go full steam forward. \n\nWhich has got Google to get going and also ignore the safety concerns as the horse is out of the barn.\n\nThere is a ton of money to be made with this type of AI.   Many, including myself, speculate that most Fortune 500 companies will be using this technology and will be spending a lot of money to get their business into a LLM.  Their own on top of a general one.\n\nThis type of application is also much more compute intensive than any other common Fortune 500 application.  So that means there is profits to be made by the big three, Google, Amazon and Microsoft.   Google margins should be a little better as they have the TPUs to leverage.   But this is also a big reason Nvidia is doing so well as Microsoft and Amazon will be use Nvidia for the inference.    But I suspect this is only in the intermediate term and you will see Microsoft and Amazon with their own TPU type devices so they can not be paying Nvidia the huge margins and instead enjoy for themselves.\n\nIt is interesting that Google has the patent but they let people just use the key AI breakthrough for free.   But I highly doubt they are going to force anyone to pay them or even license.  It is not how Google rolls."

     "A lot of these stocks never any sense to me from an investor's perspective, and I'm saying this as someone who knows the EV industry well.\n\n* Lordstown - I have no idea why this stock ever appealed to anyone. I never even heard anyone hyped up for any of their vehicles. I doubt anyone but the most hardcore EV enthusiasts could even name one of their EV models that they've announced.\n\n* Lucid - At least it had promise with it's vehicle. But the problem is it simply entered the market too late and only sells very high end luxury vehicles. Also the Saudi backers are undermining the stock by forcing them to build a factory in Saudi Arabia, a country that's a good distance away from all 3 of the largest car markets (China, the US, & Europe) and where there's very little demand for EV's.\n\n* Nikola - The thing was clearly a scam from a mile away. And Hydrogen powered vehicles are NOT EV's, it doesn't matter to the consumer if the hydrogen is turned into electricity to run the car when there's no hydrogen refueling stations near them. IMO it's flat out false advertising to claim that Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are EVs given that it can confuse consumers.\n\n* Nio - Their battery swap stations make no sense. Tesla explored this many years ago in their early days but ditched it for good reason, it's way more expensive to scale then building out an EV charging infrastructure. And Battery-As-A-Service is a terrible idea to, which is why no one else has adopted the strategy. If it weren't for them pursuing these bad strategies then Nio would be a lot more viable IMO.\n\n* Rivian - This company simply moves WAY too slow to be successful. It took them 12 years to bring a single vehicle to market. \n\nBottom line, if you want to invest in EV's just buy Tesla stock, it'll be a lot safer then any of these other EV stocks the OP mentions (given that they're sitting on a ton of cash and are making a profit, unlike the rest of these money losing EV stocks, most of which will probably go bankrupt sooner or later)."

Developers then develope games and other products with Nvidia GPU of course therefore Nvidia cards also perform often far better even when an AMD card seems stronger from the values, games still vastly run better with Nvidia cards. Same goes on for basically all industries require graphics cards or graphical services.\n\nI don't see neithe amd nor intel providing the same amount of tools and sources for graphical development and even then, nobody would double development cost including all tools, so most companies will stay with what the pipeline already uses unless intel or AMD provide VAST advancement over Nvidia which probably won't be the case within the next decade and especially intel has to recover from being kicked off the throne by AMD.\n\n>i would send a link to YouTube videos but Reddit doesn't allow to post YouTube links.\n\nSure it does I did that often enough."

They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty.\\n* **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts.

Analysts that believe in these companies are hoping that consumers will continually overpay for their cars and that manufacturer incentives won\u2019t come back so that dealers can maintain margins. \n\nWhen you have people underwater on their overpriced car it\u2019s going to be hard to flip them into a new deal, some are taking themselves out the market due to the poor pricing and rising interest rates will decrease demand. Autonation, Sonic Automotive and Asbury are all down a good amount from their all time highs. Autonation for example had a random rally in their Q4 earnings despite net income dropping, a conveniently placed share buyback and the company themselves claiming that used cars will be more expensive for them to obtain. They\u2019re now down -16% from that earning report. \n\nThere\u2019s still hard to obtain cars such as hybrids, EVs and enthusiast products but regular petrol models are widely becoming available without having to fight for MSRP."

The CCP has been proclaming thier intent to invade Taiwan since the 1950's. I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will continue to do so for the forseeable future, and thus TSMC's p/e ratio will remain at a discount relative to most of thier peers. You're only going to get paid that multibagger if you can convince others the risk of China invading is gone."

     "If they were a US company, sure they would have a higher valuation but that's only a small piece of the story.\n\nThe bigger story is that their days of higher margins and growing revenues have stopped as per TSM's own financial release.\n\nFor Q2 2023, TSM has guided to the following:\n\n||Q2 2023 (guidance)|Q2 2022|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|15.2 - 16bn (-14% YoY)|18.16bn|\n|Operating Margin|39.5% - 41.5% (-17.5% YoY)|49.1%|\n|Operating Income|6bn - 6.6bn (-29% YoY)|8.9bn|\n\nThe finances of companies change quickly, especially for a chip company.\n\nThe decline is a stark contrast to their 3-year history where they doubled their revenues.\n\nI think it will be some years before the next boom cycle begins. Remember you're calculating their PE ratio based on the peak of the cycle, and the stock price is looking towards the decline part of their cycle. You want to invest when their valuation is high (because earnings are at the trough of the cycle) and the cycle is beginning to boom.\n\nIf you reduce their earnings by 30% (as per their -29% YoY guidance), PE goes up from 14 to 20.\n\nAnother factor is that earnings is just an accounting figure - includes depreciation which was spent 5 years ago, and it doesn't factor in expenditure today.\n\nTheir Q1 2018 capex was 2.5bn.\n\nTheir Q1 2023 depreciation is 3.6bn.\n\nTheir Q1 2023 capex is 9.93bn. This means higher depreciation charge going forward which reduces EPS.\n\nTheir Q1 FCF = 2.7bn which is well below their net income of 6.8bn.\n\nThere is not a chance in hell their capex is ever going to go back to 2.5bn.\n\nTheir FCF for the last 4 quarters is 16.1bn, which gives a P/FCF ratio of 27.9.\n\nFor comparison, ASML's capex in 2018 (full year) only increased from 0.60bn EUR to 1.32bn EUR.\n\nASML's P/FCF ratio is 31.5 which is not that much higher than TSM's P/FCF.\n\nASML's guidance\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Q2 2023 (guidance in USD)|Q2 2022|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|\\~7.02 - 7.56bn (27.8% YoY)|5.7bn |\n|Operating Margin|30% (no change)|30%|\n|Operating Profit|2.1 - 2.27bn (26% YoY)|1.73bn|\n\nASML expects full year 2023 sales to be 25% greater than 2022.\n\nUnless TSM's guidance is really bad and they out deliver massively, it's clear that they are NOT cheap when looking at their negative revenue growth expectations and lagging earnings numbers due to their capex increasing 4x in 5 years.\n\nASML is justifiably valued higher as their revenue growth is still intact and capex has only increased 2-3x. (Reminder that TSM's higher capex is good for ASML, since they're one of ASML's customers)."

     "1. Focus on getting a (higher) income and investing as much of that income into the market as possible on a regular basis. That way you can ask /r/stocks, \"What should I do with my $100-$500 in excess cash that I earn every single month that will compound into thousands as I increase my savings rate over time\"?  If you're in high school or something, get educated and maximize your earnings potential.\n2. Rethink your priorities about wanting to 'have money' each month. That shouldn't be the goal of investing at this presumably early stage. You want to grow your portfolio by contributing as much as you can as early as you can. What is $30 in dividends each year ($4 a month?) going to give you? Unless you are retired or already have a very large portfolio, chasing tiny sums of dividends is pointless. If you want income, find a job, don't sabotage your investment portfolio by siphoning off the dividends!\n3. Focus on diversified strategies for your regular investments. My guess is you aren't doing a lot of research into individual stocks (if you are, my apologies) and randomly picking blue chips is a poor strategy. (Have you investigated the valuations of MCD? Its free cash flow? Dividend growth? Does it compare favorably to treasuries? Do you expect it to outgrow the S&P 500?)"

I hope you question is sincere and you are not just being a bear, hiding in the shadows and pretending to want to learn.\n\nI do not have my research with me but there are a few things to consider, the first is your 20% growth rate.  If you look at the past 5-years, I feel like their demonstrated EPS growth was greater than 45% with the most recent year being closer 85%.  Additionally their 3-5 year projected is maybe 35% to 45%.  As a longtime holder, I know I have never seen a forward EPS projection of greater than 50% so there is room for them to surprise high.  IMO, this puts them at greater than 40% growth, not 20% as you state.  \n\nThe second point I would like to address is time, you mention can they maintain this performance for a decade.  If you consider we are in the first 6 to 7 years of the 4th industrial revolution and each of the prior IRs have last between 50 and 70 years, yes I firmly believe we can assume another decade of their performance.  We all know they are at the forefront of some major 4IR themes like AI, automation, AR/VR but they are also already playing a role in the next wave of ARKG like things, which I believe is still 10+ years out, such as (forgive me for not recalling these items well, they are too far out for me to have spent much time researching) protein incubators, synthetic proteins, and biochambers."

Intel itself uses TSMC for the latest generation processors because their fabs are behind. Investing in new fab tech is always a multi-year gamble ahead and we haven\u2019t seen the customer base or the steep investment in new cutting edge fab techniques. \n\nWhat intel has going for it is xenophobic gov buyers who want American vertical integration, even if it means semiconductors are less efficient or several generations behind the state of the art."

We don't know what are your goals. If you are a long term investor, I think \"gambling\" 66% if your portfolio on stock picks is extremely risky, even more so that you have very few titles, so it's very concentrated. Sure there are a few solid defensive picks, but it's not enough. I don't see real estate either.\n\nIf you still want to pick individual stocks (which requires a lot of time and research and increases your risk a lot) I would lower the proportion allocated to individual stock. Your core positions should be the majority of your portfolio and be ETFs.\n\nI think being aware of the difficulty of picking the right stocks, of our cognitive biases, of investment styles, and learning about yourself (how you deal with stress, losses, hard decision, regret) are all very important."

Their rev will likely be slashed 50% or more.\n\nIf you think cryto coins will continue to be valuable then sure. Nvidia will be like a crypto inflation hedge. As crypto inflates, it will take Nvidia with it.\n\nOne caveat. Intel has announced that they are finally going to compete on GPU with AMD and Nvidia. They have always made GPU's but they never focused on performance before. But they can most assuredly compete. They have the tech and manufacturing to do so. Further its not really a GPU that makes mining better, its simply the parallelism that was built into GPU's about 10 years ago. There is no reason why you cant build that into any regular CPU. In fact, it a lot more efficient to place that feature directly on the CPU. \n\nI wouldnt worry about Intel yet, but you do need keep an eye on them. The good news is they have been mismanaged for over 20 years now and its hard to overcome bad management because they are usually entrenched hard in the upper echelons. For every Apple there are 100 IBMs, T's and Xerox's."

Not all buybacks are good buybacks.\nIntel is lagging behind with its technology. \n\nI like a good company story and sometimes do turnaround plays.

     "They make various levels of GPU's and each year they go up in performance. With the increase in performance I'm sure they optimize energy efficiency as best they can. If the increase to performance was linear with the number of watts it takes to run you would need a nuclear reactor to power your GPU (editorializing but still...)\n\nI'm no expert but a quick Google search shows Nvidia's first GPU ever had a recommended 200 watts. A 3080 is under 400 watts. The difference in performance and capabilities between those are, well practically like Atari vs high end VR.\n\nIf someone wants a more energy efficient GPU they can go for a lower end GPU and use software to reduce the output and therefore the power drain. It's something that already exists, you can run at 70%. Why would they make a new line of GPU's that are not better than the last when you can just buy one of the previous generations or throttle the GPU?\n\nThat's like asking why isn't apple making a nokia brick phone that can last on battery for 10 days straight. Sure, maybe it's possible but that's not advancing technology/performance/capabilities/or the product line. It just doesn't make sense. If you really want that ^ go buy the 20 year old nokia brick which used to last for like 10 days.\n\nTldr; the customer isn't always right, more often then not the customer is an idiot."

And again, there are a number of them in the line. You are actually describing what they do. The 3050 is similar in performance to the 1660 super (3 year old GPU) and the 3050 is recommended 350 watts and the 1660 is recommended 470 watts.\n\nPerformance increases inherently = power efficiency.\n\nAgain, if performance increases were linear with wattage no one would be able to run them.\n\nAgain, customers are idiots. They want the 3090 at 200 watts when that's just not going to be a thing *now*. Eventually they will release the 6060 or something which will be equivalent to the 3090 performance at lower wattage and drain.\n\nPeople want a rocket ship that runs on a AA battery and obviously if that technology existed it would be for sale. Eventually, what we consider to be a rocket ship today will eventually run on a AA battery, but no you can't expect a high end GPU without running it at what it requires for power, obviously."

Intel's new 12th gen CPU set is pretty power hungry too. \n\nA lot of factors at play though. Price. Mining performance. Gaming performance. If they can provide NVidia 3060-3080 performance for a significantly lower price point, they'll take a bite out of Nvidia. But, by the time these roll around in 2022... Nvidia will probably be rolling out their 4000 series and mop the floor with everyone again.\n\nIf Intel comes out with a bang and has RTX 3080 performance for say $499, with abundant inventory, they can definitely make a splash."

  "Text": "b'Word on the street is that Adobe ($ADBE) has been playing some sly games to maintain its market dominance. Rumor has it they\\'ve been strategically seeding the internet with pirated copies of Photoshop, making it a breeze to crack. This tactic has allowed them to establish an iron grip on the industry, while turning a blind eye to the pirates dancing around with their illicit copies. It\\'s no wonder the phrase \"that\\'s Photoshopped!\" has become synonymous with digital trickery. Talk about keeping the competition at bay!\\r  \\n\\r  \\nBut hold on tight, because there\\'s a game-changer in town. Introducing Firefly AI, the surprise superstar of Photoshop (BETA). This AI-powered tool is an absolute game-changer, my friends. Nothing else out there can match its capabilities right now, and mark my words, it\\'s only going to get better. Brace yourselves for mind-blowing photo mash-ups that will blow your artistic socks off. The momentum it\\'s generating is sending shockwaves through the creative universe!'",

     "Alright, I dig it.  But here\u2019s the thing.  If adobe puts out it\u2019s own ai to do photo editing (and logically expands into film, graphic design, and all their other projects), they are shooting themselves in the foot selling fewer licenses to companies employing people to do these things.  \n\nIf company x can use a highly tuned firefly ai to have 1 editor do the the work of 5, then who loses the sale of 4 subscriptions?  Adobe.  Naturally, I assume adobe will sell firefly subscriptions for a mint to cover the lost licenses but even doubling the subscription price would be a stretch and they\u2019d likely get pushback from professionals who do not wish to be replaced.  \n\nAdditionally, putting out a new tool only available by what would have to be a very expensive subscription bars people from learning it.  Adobe student subscriptions have been a loophole for years.  But when students graduate if they can\u2019t afford licenses for the ai software they\u2019re used to, they don\u2019t buy so they either go work at a firm which is already cutting their staff or they pirate it or they find an alternative.  None of which is good for adobe"

The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  \\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities.

     "It's tough to gauge where Palantir is at. On one hand, their software is pretty incredible and it really seems like there are almost no competitors. If their AIP platform takes off with the commercial side, then I think that will quickly become their central business. On the other hand, the fundamentals of the company on a free cash flow basis support the stock price if you make some very optimistic assumptions. Basically, they have to grow their free cash flow at 16% per year to justify the current price. Moreover, the company is known to issue large amounts of stock based compensation which of course dilutes shareholders. I don't think it would be wise chasing Palantir at these levels  right now. \n\nDisclosure: I am long Palantir."

     "Interesting article on hacker news, apparently the staff at Meta dont use their VR headsets much either. I cant use VR at all because I get vertigo and know many other do. migraines too. so I thought Metaverse was doomed to fail from the get go. Anyway...\n\nGoogle have Deep mind, and have been in the game with powerful AI for a while, what trumped them is public access. ChatGPT was a master stroke in that regard and blew the lid off companies hording \"their precious\".\n\nI am in TQQQ on this, the reason is that AI big bois are propping up the markets but any one of them could take a tumble on a proper game-changing moment from leftfield. Ultimately it's the big names that will own AI, or buy it out, all else will be open source catching up. So open source is the place to look. but...\n\nThough its a bit like crapto post 2013, where it was almost impossible to pick winners, but if you threw enough at a bundle, one might moonshot. Its happening fast now , but the difference this time is the AI companies stock is not 0.001 cent, but already at >$200, so no one is jumping in.\n\nNVDA should have been predictable obvious one, and I am still seeing lots of investors poo-pooing it saying dont get in now , too expensive. But this misses the impact of AI to turn these big companies into absolute monsters. \n\nSame with Adobe. they just brought out generative fill. thats a game changer, and they will have monopoly on graphics for a while. if their price seems to high at $400 then by all means do a Cathy Wood and fail to realise the impact of AI as it sends big players sky rocketing. \n\nmy view is grab anything already big in AI and wait 3-5 years. whats coming could add a zero to anything. but buying small stuff looking for moonshots may not be the way.\n\nmeantime the biggest market yet to be breached imo is home robots. M3gan is the most insightful movie on this. Its way off though, the hype is not the truth with home robots yet. but AI first."

AI is still in very early stages.  The costs will come down dramatically to the detriment of Nvidia.  In 2007, it cost $10 Million to sequence a human genome; today it costs $200.

  "Text": "b\"Shareholders finally approve NVIDIA stock split. The stock split will be payable in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record as of June 21 will receive an additional three shares of stock for every share held. The shares will be distributed after the market close on July 19, and the newly split shares will begin trading when the market opens on Tuesday, July 20. \\n\\nExisting shareholders won't have to do anything to receive the additional shares, which will be deposited directly into their brokerage accounts once the stock split takes effect. It's important to note that investors shouldn't necessarily expect the new shares to appear in their account immediately after the market close on July 19. As internal processes differ from brokerage to brokerage, it may take as many as several days for the new shares to show up in investor accounts.\\n\\nFinally, investors should remember that a stock split does nothing to change the value of the underlying business, but merely divides \"",

Intel is not winning any of this MS back!!!\n\n4) Intel is betting on the foundry.  They have no real customers to note\u2026.and can\u2019t do it as profitably as TSMC and Samsung.  Combine this with the fact they will likely need to offer better pricing to get business\u2026.margins will suck for at least a decade.  \n\nIntel is sputtering and on the decline."

     "So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.\n\nThe truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?\n\nThe answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.\n\nIn the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.\n\nWhich brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.\n\nIn 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s..."

Mostly so to create an AI that can understand the user\u2019s surroundings and can be used in both AR glasses and autonomous vehicles. Tim Cook himself has mentioned they see this as their hardest problem, but one they intent to solve. Other than that AAPL in general is a great stock to own.\n\nW.r.t. green energy I\u2019d recommend Fluence (FLNC), which is a global leader in utility battery energy storage. The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play."

For the buy low sell high mantra, things are not looking horrific however. \n\nFor green tech,\n\nI like RIO under 60, copper and rare earths. For more risky/speculative, I like TLGRF (battery anode + mining) at $1.00 usd or lower, which it is roughly at now. and I think something for the watch list is PYR; they might go through a reverse split in the next 6 months. if that happens, once the dust settles I will have to go in. \n\nThere is no rush. I do not see the next 2 months as good for the market. I recommend waiting or DCA, and only after doing your own DD. These are ideas that I like. Two safe ones, and two risky ones."

     "I think we are in, how do you say, a bubble but a bubble with many smaller bubbles within in it. Sort of like a large bubble encasing many smaller ones. Anyone of these bubbles popping could cause a contagion effect. What is concerning is the fact this economy has been injected with cash from the actions due to the pandemic. Was injecting cash a good thing? Eh, hindsight is 20/20..am I right? Rhetorical of course, we simply don\u2019t 100% know. I do know many folks and businesses alike are using these funds, wages and savings to push up the market all while collecting money from these investments. Might be an explanation to where some of the missing work force went. It\u2019s very interesting using analytics and techniques to review market data but it\u2019s human behavior at the core. Right now everyone who has skin in the game are at best trying to find what will pop first. With so much fear and confusion it\u2019s like the fed thinks we need something familiar to happen in the market to know which way is up. IMO not gonna happen. This inflation is going to stick. Why? Too much money chasing too few goods. Slap the working force and unemployment goes up. Thing is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the working class with the money. So I see high unemployment and moderate inflation 4-5%, but a big demand in growth for services. So I\u2019ll call it Flowflation. Ew, how do we get out of this? Policy to detach from energy costs and dare I say it drop interest rates and some how get the rich closer to us in terms of income. I\u2019m also skeptical that something is lurking in the shadows of some heavy weight countries. That\u2019s my Ted talk thanks for reading \ud83d\ude4f"

It is a pure gambling machine based on technical analysis. \n\nhttps://talkmarkets.com/content/nasdaq-bitcoin-gold-among-beneficiaries-of-falling-rates-expectations?post=389768\n\nThis is an article that sends shivers down my spine. First this part:\n\n\"The market is thus betting that we have reached a peak in terms of rate hikes and that from here looser monetary policy should follow.\n\nThe Fed, SNB, and BoE all hikes interest rates this week, but the message from these banks was the same: more increases may be required, not will be if inflationary pressures persist.\"\n\nWhere on earth are people getting this idea? The Fed is doing something rather clever. They are providing liquidity at ever increasing rates. Meaning you can have money, but it will cost you. They are completely misunderstanding looser monetary policy.\n\nSecondly, the idea that you can read the market as an uptrend because of some technical analysis is ludicrous. Technical analysis works until it does not work, and then it does not work really badly. People have since 2008 only seen a market that goes up. That is scary as it implies we have a generation of \"investors\" that don't understand that markets can go down hard.\n\nIt will burst, but it will be death by a thousand cuts."

My personal view is certain parts of the tech sector: APPL, MSFT etc\u2026have taken in a lot of sideline cash in anticipation of rate pauses (or even cuts) and are currently overvalued. Great companies but not at a fair price. I had a big bag of MSFT, sold 60% this week.

     "LOL at Tim Cook, he literally did nothing. Apple is all brand and it became so because of Steve Jobs and a good marketing campaign in the past. Revenue growth is less than inflation meaning that the company is losing money YoY without accounting for inflation.\n\nThere are plenty of great CEOs that made incredible turnarounds, this sub only focus on the most well known companies, some of which have such powerful brands that don't require a great CEO to maintain their market position.\n\nGoogle CEO is also terrible. They literally didn't innovate at all, it's still just the search engine. All attempts to diversify were huge failures. Google Cloud is a joke. Youtube is just a good acquisition but that's all.\n\nZuckemberg is losing money with that stupid metaverse and he's such a big weirdo and nutcase. He also allowed TikTok to take over their core business despite enjoying huge benefits as a monopolist in the sector with high switching costs.\n\nAmazon still didn't find a way to have decent margins on their e-commerce business despite the fact they had almost a monopoly for over a decade and it's been 30 years that the e-commerce platform has been created. And. AWS is slowing down.\n\nNvidia is a meme stock nowadays that was extremely lucky to ride the crypto boom. What merit the CEO has to just be lucky enough to sell the GPUs that then found an application for mining coins? Just luck, they didn't create the GPU because of crypto, they produced them for a completetely different segment. Revenues have pummeled and people that praise it didn't even look at the balance sheet. I'll argue with anybody on here who tell me that Nvidia balance sheet is in good shape. In May 2022  they reported revenues of 8,3 billions....in October 2022 revenues 5,9 billions...they literally collapsed despite the inflation.\n\nMay 2022 EBITDA 3,55 billions, Jun 2022 EBITDA 770 millions....LOL\n\nThis sub is just an echo chamber that parrot back what others say.\n\nIn the real world, it's not even questionable that Elon is the greatest. Nobody has his track record. He made Tesla a powerhouse, he created SpaceX, he created The Boring Company, created NeuraLink, created StarLink, created OpenAI, created Paypal, ecc.\n\nOnly clueless Elon Musk haters and trolls can put him behind the other Tech Ceo who literally did nothing and only maintained market positions thanks to huge and powerful brands that they inherited (they didn't create it)."

Here are some of the most promising:\n\n1. Healthcare: AI can help reduce costs in healthcare by streamlining administrative tasks, improving diagnostic accuracy, and predicting patient outcomes.\n\n2. Manufacturing: AI can optimize manufacturing processes by predicting maintenance needs, reducing downtime, and increasing production efficiency.\n\n3. Retail: AI can help retailers optimize inventory management, reduce waste, and personalize customer experiences, leading to increased sales and cost savings.\n\n4. Banking and finance: AI can help banks and financial institutions automate routine tasks, detect fraudulent activity, and optimize investment strategies.\n\n5. Transportation: AI can optimize transportation networks, reduce fuel consumption, and improve logistics, leading to significant cost savings for both shippers and carriers.\n\nOverall, the potential cost savings from AI are significant and span across many industries. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see even more industries benefiting from its advancements."

Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive in the future, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality.

Over the next 12 months, they're projected to double that to 9.33 EPS. Thus forward p/e ratio is only 36. The company has very little debt and pays a small dividend.

     "TLDR: Nvidia has been leading the way in consumer-grade PC graphics cards. The ones we play Fortnite with for about 5+ years without any rebuttle from their only competitor, AMD. Although AMD has been making strides overall as a company, only rivals Nvidia in one segment of grpahics cards, the budget-low end. Nvidia's long standing as the goliath in the market, secured them other opportunities like enterprise scale super computers that are in Universities and other places that need super computing. AMD's budget cards, although \"good enough\", secured them deals with Microsoft and their consoles.  \n\n\nLets talk future: Nvidia's next gen launch is going to showcase the full capabilites this architecture was designed for. Nvidia will lead, again, in the enterprise and consumer sector with these graphic cards. AMD has a launch too, but they are still a generation behind as their best GPU, 5700XT is weaker than Nvidia's by 4 cards. (I gave you AMD boys the 1080TI, so RTX 2080 and up). With Mixed/Virual Reality, Content Creation, and Streaming on the highest incline, we can accurately speculate that this launch will be successful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLSDR: If you have any thoughts of buying NVDA, do it now and not when its over $400. Selling all my positions of $T and dumping into NVDA."

     "\"That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339\"\n\nVery insightful technical analysis of NVDA. To say that the share price is worth $49 would put it around pre-2016 levels before the crypto boom. Going from 6566 employees to over 11k employees (2018) means they are doing something right. Along with the recent Mellanox/Cumulus acquisitions, this would definitely place the stock price at least much higher than their 2016 levels. Keep in mind that the company is founder led by (IMO) one of the top CEOs in American history for over 27 years. \n\nIt is hard to deny that AI/HPC/gaming will only evolve and grow in the future so the share price today reflects that sentiment. Only time will tell if NVDA is worth the price it is today. But $49 on a 30b market cap valuation is just simply ridiculously low."

My educated guess is that OP is probably a BI analyst or Data scientist, who is more familiar with R, SQL, Tableau, than Tensorflow, cuda, or python in general.\n\nI am a ML engineer myself and I can say that the whole AI/ ML area will just vanish now if without Nvidia. We rely heavily heavily heavily on CUDA, tensorflow, pytorch, etc. None of them can steadily run on AMD graphics card. Everyone on my team has a company desktop top with at least one top notch Nvidia GPU for develop. For actual training, we have company-wide ML clould with hundreds if not thousands Nvidia Tesla cards. \n\nWill this be changed? Yes probably when specialized AI chips (e.g Google TPU) is a thing. or when the next non-neural network ML model is invented, which requires a huge paradigm shift in AI research, and I don't think that will happen in the next 5-10 years.\n\nAlso AI/ML IS BIG now, and it will become bigger.\n\nAll these being said, I don't have any NVDA stock now (sold all my postions late 2018).

Their greatest strength, Glide, became their greatest weakness when both the gaming industry and the GPU industry focused on DirectX and OpenGL.\n\nAs a gamer back then, the choice was obvious. The final nails in 3dfx\u2019s coffin were the reasons above, but they fucked themselves into a corner long before."

     "Nvidia still has high demand for their GPU's. They sell out even without mining and high price tag. \n\nA lot of people will be investing in powerful desktop workspaces for home due to coronavirus. The shift to remote work is going to be the outlier here. You won't be able to get a job without a fast or capable computer. So nvidia will have strong demand from both professional and gaming markets for their cards at all price points. \n\nXbox and ps5 will fail at launch this year, due to the supply chains being effected and consumer spending. Sony and Microsoft are all shifting to cloud based gaming anyways, so the only console maker after this new line will be nintendo going forward. Nvidia is already in cloud based gaming with shield.\n\nI do not see nvidia losing market share because to be frankly honest, amd is not competitive yet. The features nvidia gives and the stability it provides is vastly ahead of amd at the moment. Maybe, rdna2 by amd will show us something new but I doubt it, after seeing the xbox and ps5 demos.  \n\nIt's not overvalued and is still bull because there is no proven competition yet.

With this, their hardware will set the standard for what type of architecture most games are programmed on. Games will be programmed to have their most functionality on AMD hardware. \n\nI think AMD is better positioned to be the leader in gaming graphics this generation, and has plenty of room for growth."

So why arent CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been undershipping chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).\\n\\nWe have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters, Su said, as spotted by PC Gamer.

It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So lets break it down\\n\\nEV stands for Enterprise Value. Enterprise value is made up of the companys equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the companys value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash.

In the last 10 years the minimum was 12.79, the median 31.09 and the maximum 96.39. For the PE ratio to get back to median value there are two possibilities, either the company grows faster than expected (quite difficult since a generous growth has already been priced in) or the share price falls.\n\nHope I give you another perspective on the NVDA valuation!"

People can Google what EBITDA is and how it\u2019s calculated if they don\u2019t know. It made your write up longer than it needed to be. Also, you flip flop back and forth in numbers (billions and millions). I don\u2019t think NVidia has 19782 billion is cash, I think you are missing a period after the 9 maybe. Also, use commas (or a space depending on where you are located in the world) between thousands (19,782 for instance). It\u2019s so difficult to quickly understand the number without commas. Sorry to harp so much on format, but if format is no good people will not respect the content of your analysis. Another example is when you say Nvidea 5 year growth is 1.401%. I assume you mean 1,401%. Any analysis you post publicly should be much tighter formatting/reviewed. Good luck in your investing."

     "I don't quite understand why people compare valuation ratios with the industry average. Isn't it possible the entire sector is in a bubble? This is a genuine question. I would appreciate an answer.\n\nGPU crypto mining is more likely to die out than to grow. As far as I know, no new crypto project uses Proof of Work. That leaves us with Bitcoin and its cousins. If Bitcoin succeeds, mining difficulty will ratchet up and GPUs will not even be considered for mining. If Bitcoin fails, no one will want to mine anyway. And already, most of network's hashing power comes from ASIC rigs, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nFor gaming, NVIDIA does have a pretty good moat in PC gaming, eventhough they have lost the consoles to AMD for now. And AMD is closing in. But, I think the bigger threat is a good game streaming service. If Google Stadia or a hypothetical Apple service becomes good, which I think is highly likely, they won't have any trouble catching a userbase, given their extensive ecosystem. While GeForce Now might be a good subscription model for NVIDIA, IMO it'll be difficult for it to compete against a service that comes with an entrenched ecosystem. While it is possible that NVIDIA chips power those game streaming services, it is also possible that they don't. With AMD closing in, and the larger trend of companies designing their own chips, no telling how that might go.\n\nI welcome critical comments."

     ">Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn\u2019t as black and white, but that\u2019s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIn the short amount of time, e.g. daily trading, human psychology may convert or is more or less unanimous. And that can be captured neatly in a stock's price.\n\nBut stock price is one dimensional.  Over a long period of time, the psychology on why someone or some institution buys or sells a stock becomes complicated.   The one dimensional stock price cannot possibly capture the psychology behind buying and selling."

     "My critique of this DD is that it is not finished! You have done a great job at what you've done so far, and it's a really good base to perform a more thorough valuation, but there is more digging to be had here. The most important thing is trying to figure out how much money you think the business will make over time. It doesn't have to be 100% accurate, but there should always be a rough idea of how much you expect them to make. When you do this, it's important to factor in the risk of the business going under or being outcompeted (make sure you discount that from how much money you expect them to make). Also it's really important to understand how their business works. Personally, I know nothing about tech, but this could be a great play for someone who understands the industry better than me. \n\nBasically I think you've done a great job here, but you have more work to do! What I'd recommend you do from here is skim more quarterly and annual reports to see how they work on the more minute levels. Anyhow, you're doing amazing, keep up the good work! (:"

So, the 30% down vision you have is still a bubble from when other people were screaming the same song over the last 30 years. Crashes aren't really crashes when they never crash down to levels seen in the prior crash. The NASDAQ is up so much since the 1990's it's crazy. All while having wars, shootings, and all the nonsense bears say will produce a crash. Wrong for too long equals wrong forever."

Initially, I invested in AMD back in 2016, primarily because it was more affordable compared to Intel, and I happened to get lucky. In 2018, I added NVIDIA to my portfolio as I had a deep interest in gaming and GPU/computer building. In 2020, I purchased an Oculus device, which allowed me to glimpse into an untapped future. Interestingly, Facebook, now META, has emerged as a dominant player in this space. It's possible that they will enjoy several years of success, much like Intel did in 2016.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nRecently, I discovered Roblox, a company that shares my vision and embodies how I envision the true metaverse operating. They have a long road ahead, but with the right talent within the company, they have the potential to achieve their goals.

Neither will have any future in \"the metaverse\" because they aren't doing the technology that will actually drive people to the metaverse and out of the games there currently are.\n\nRoblox may be its own version of what could be considered a metaverse just like Fortnite and Minecraft but they lack the ability to go outside of their own game, the ability to take items out of certain games and into others is what will drive popularity along with being able to sell those items to other players. Decentralization is the way, none of the current infrastructure for any of these games incorporate this ability.\n\nThere are few public companies that are pushing for this reality and building it. Anything less will just be what we already have and will not be disruptive or innovative."

So Nvidia will have to rely on some server based tech (they claim A100 GPUs), which renders Cloudflare's Workers tech redundant at this point. \n\nIf they do extend support to Tensorflow, they now need to rely on a C++ compiler as well, which takes away the biggest benefit (extremely fast cold start times) since you can no longer use a V8 isolate for an ML worker.\n\nTl;dr: Current cloudflare tech isn't built for AI.

     " I saw the live event yesterday, there wasn't really anything surprising. Gains were nice, above average, but it's semiconductor, 2x gains every 2 years is the norm, that's Moore's law for you. It does look like a solid generation though, some of the rendered videos they showed looked absolutely stunning, Ray tracing will really take us to completely photo-realistic computer generated videos. The eye works on ray tracing (photons hitting the retina) so it should work.\n\nBiggest issue I had was the announcement that the cards were fabbed on Samsung 8nm \"Nvidia custom node\".\n\nI don't really like this, that's a really old ass node. Samsung 8nm is really just Samsung 10nm with a new coat of paint. About 15% logic density over 10 nm, with maybe 5-8% performance gain.\n\nIt's hard to compare logic nodes between manufacturers, performance is very hard, but for transistor density this chart is good,\n\n[https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm\\_vs\\_10nm\\_vs\\_12nm\\_vs\\_14nm\\_Transistor\\_Densities](https://www.techcenturion.com/7nm-10nm-14nm-fabrication#nbspnbspnbspnbsp7nm_vs_10nm_vs_12nm_vs_14nm_Transistor_Densities)\n\nRTX 2000-series was on TSMC 12 nm with 34 million transistors per mm\\^2, Samsung 8nm is 61.2 MTr /mm\\^2. It's a nice 80% density gain, but it's like really fucking old stuff. Smartphone were getting fabbed on TSMC 10 nm (comparable to Samsung 8nm), in 2017 with the Snapdragon 845 (thing that goes in all flagship android phones).\n\nIn 2018 Snapdragon 855 was on 7nm.\n\nIn 2019 Snapdragon 865 was on \"advanced 7nm\" N7P, about a 15% performance gain.\n\nIn 2020 Apple will launch the next iPhone on TSMC\u2019s 5nm EUV in a couple weeks.\n\nTSMC 5nm has a transistor density of 171.3 MTr /mm\\^2, destroying Samsung 8nm @ 61.2 MTr /mm\\^2. Being around 2.8x more dense and \\~140% more performance per watt.\n\nNvidia seems to be on lukewarm terms with TSMC, while TSMC's new best friend is AMD. After lawmakers banned Huawei from using TSMC, AMD quickly gobbled up all their reserved 5nm wafers. AMD is going hard pushing newer nodes, of course larger dies like GPUs do kinda need to be on older more mature nodes. Just so they can fab such huge dies without defects and get good yields. AMD also has CPUs, which are much smaller and can handle higher defect rates. AMD is pushing 5nm CPUs in 2021, probably GPUs soon to follow. While Nvidia seems to be trying to nickle and dime Samsung getting good prices on their refreshed 10nm node.\n\nPros I think is that Samsung has a lot of capacity, they've really fallen behind TSMC lately, and they kinda suck. But obviously Nvidia can still deliver strong performance gains and will be able to pump out a lot of GPUs with all that capacity available at Samsung. Leaving all that performance on the table also gives them a really easy next generation. All they would need to do is move the same GPU to TSMC 7nm EUV (which they really just could have fabbed on today), and they would have an almost free 2x boost in performance over Ampere.\n\nAlthough...maybe none of this really matters. Their data center work-horse Nvidia A100 is of course on TSMC 7nm, and that's where they make all the real money anyways. Gamers not clogging up capacity on TSMC 7nm so the people who pay the real money can get all the A100s they want is a good thing.\n\nNvidia has also been really successful in selling dedicated AI research hardware to gamers. The AI people are very happy, because they're getting everything they want, 24GB on 3090, 40GB on A100, vastly improved tensor units, hardware sparsity optimization, TF32. They're really happy about Ampere. Gamers get sold this as DLSS, RTX voice, NVIDIA Broadcast. I don't think they really realize the tensor cores will be sitting idle over 90% of the time in games, and they're really just for training and running neural networks. DLSS is really impressive though, the way AI lets you cast fewer rays and fill in the blanks with a neural network is very clever and does vastly improve picture quality. I think Nvidia has sufficiently justified the tensor cores existence to gamers and they have accepted them.\n\nIt really helps Nvidia streamline their product lineup, I mean, the 3090 has\n\n36 TFLOPs FP32 (normal graphics)\n\n69 TFLOPs RT (Ray tracing)\n\n285 TFLOPS (AI acceleration)\n\nFor comparison, Google's latest Cloud TPU v3, purely for AI acceleration has 90 TFLOPS per chip. Tesla's \"Full Self-Driving\" AI Chip has 74 TOPS (37 TFLOPS). Nvidia has really succeed in selling AI accelerators with gaming support to both data centers and gamers. It's good business and more focused development teams, good synergy.\n\nYou're so performance limit by heat anyways, I think tensor cores takes up maybe 10% of the GPU, you can only create so much heat in a tiny area, throw in some tensor cores to space things out and it doesn't really matter for gaming performance. It could even improve gaming performance because it makes the chip easier to cool, just makes the whole thing a bit bigger really."

You dont believe it and everyone thinks its gonna come back and retest.  Now way this could be the bottom.  While others are feeling the FOMO of missing the bottom.   There is always that split. \\n\\nBut this just feels overdone.  Big mega companies like Nvidia and TSLA have run 80% in a matter of weeks.  \\n\\nSo where do you stand ?  \\n\\nDo you think a massive drop is coming by end of March or you are in the camp that its mostly going to up or sideways for next few months and fed is going to be pausing if not cutting and lot of bad news will trickle and that would mean that the economy feels bad but the stocks market will feel good about that as all bad news will be out.   \\n\\nWhat are the stocks yo'",

This is completely useless without seeing your inputs in the DCF analysis. Also I feel like I see people specifically use GAAP EPS instead of Non-GAAP EPS just to make a company look more expensive. If anyone is curious you can look at a companies investor relations page and read their earnings release to see reconciliation between GAAP and NON-GAAP and decide for yourself how you want to value the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNon-GAAP PE of \\~56.8, FWD PE of \\~48.3. This forward estimate (from yahoo finance) does not include revisions since their latest earnings release. Forward looking estimates will almost certainly be revised upwards and the stock will get cheaper on a forward basis. Not too expensive IMO for a company that just grew topline 60% YOY and bottomline 100% YOY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is what Argus Research says in their latest report for NVDA dated November 2020:\n\n\"On our more forward-looking DFCF valuation, NVDA is valued in the $900s, above current prices and in a sharply rising trend. Our blended valuation is in the mid-$800s and also in a sharply rising trend.  NVidia operates powerful and profitable franchises. We believe that most technology investors should own NVDA in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven applications acceleration. We are reiterating our BUY rating to a 12-month target price of $600.\""

     "Nice writeup, not too long and a good categorization of pros and cons.\n\nI have written about NVDA a few times before, I am long since 2019 with a cost basis of $139.50. For a long time, NVDA was about 5% of my portfolio (I prefer to hold about 20 high conviction, long-term companies in my portfolio at any given time) but recently, NVDA as a position has now fallen to more like 2-3% of my portfolio. I would therefore also like to add more (at least double my position), but I am apprehensive about the valuation (the obvious time to add would have been in March 2020, duh...).\n\nAnyway, I do believe that Nvidia can eventually easily get to $100B+ in annual revenues. I work in a \"niche\" field that's not quite cloud, HPC or gaming but has similar technology requirements and I foresee a version of the future where the ARM-based Nvidia DPUs dominate the generic backend compute that is still dominated by x86 today (Intel and AMD). This is also the reason why I am not nearly as bullish on AMD as I am on Nvidia. Also as a side note, we use Mellanox NICs and they are a great company/team and a technology leader in what they do (I prefer their NICs over e.g. Solarflare).\n\nTo summarize, I am starting to think that I might have been wrong about the valuation with Nvidia and indeed missed some good buying opportunities during the last 6-8 months when it was available for below $500 (even after the post March 2020 recovery). Just to explain myself better, I do consider myself a value investor and typically the earnings multiple is one of the first things I look at. A lot (but not all) of my other 5% holdings are more classic \"value\".\n\nAnd just to clarify something, the thing is, from a purely quantitative POV,  40x forward earnings is not insanity... at 20% annual earnings growth, price-to-earnings multiples up to 40 (or even 50) can be acceptable (see \"Security Analysis\" by Graham et al). It's all about what the risk is with respect to the company being able to maintain its current earnings growth trajectory.\n\nThe $300B EV might be another thing that understandably turns people off, but obviously at some point Nvidia can start accelerating stock buybacks.\n\nFWIW, I am not adding yet at these levels, but I am seriously thinking about it.\n\nP.S. One thing about Nvidia is that it's not a SW company so it doesn't have SW company margins or ROC/ROA. However, part of its moat is the barrier of entry and uniqueness in the competitive space. Like you said, a risk is that the IaaS companies / cloud providers will use their profits to design and build their own chips (in that scenario, ARM is still a major winner though)."

That's not saying that people aren't going to go to pet stores, but I do think that buying elsewhere has had an impact.\n\nSimilar to WBA/CVS, Petco trying to adapt to changes by moving towards services - \"Petco: We are \u2018becoming a services business,\u2019 CEO says\"  https://finance.yahoo.com/video/petco-becoming-services-business-ceo-150603247.html. \n\nWBA has been a \"can't win\" for years now. Peaked in 2015, too many stores, is down 62% since. Covid wasn't the beneficiary people thought it would be and the stock keeps heading lower. I haven't liked the business for years but at around book value with a good newer CEO, one feels like it's a little overhated. \n\nWBA isn't going to the moon (or probably anything remotely close) any time soon and neither is WOOF, but trading at around book (WOOF is at about book value) feels a little overhated for something that is not an exciting business at all but probably isn't going away any time soon. \n\nI don't own either."

While growing, they don't care about spending, they need to reach their potential at all cost and as soon as they can to beat competition.

Our transportation tech had not advanced as much.  Our battery tech is stuck on lithium for so long.  We're still so reliant on crude oil.  We still don't have substitute for plastic.  Chatgpt is not all that great. It can't even remember my name and my favorite color and hobbies. I have to remind it every day. Sometimes it forgets in 10 min. All it is good for is for students to do homework. Write essays and math problems.  Good for college computer science students for coding.  It basically exposes the flaw of our education system. School has been too focused on testing and memorization.  Homework is useless with chatgpt. Chatgpt is great for people who genuinely want to learn, at the same time it helps people who don't want to learn to not learn. The only impressive tech we got are screens. We got high resolution monitors, we got vr, we got projectors. Screen tech is very advanced and impressive. That's because that is where the money is at. I think tech companies growth slow down because we reached the peak of screen tech. Or near that peak. I don't think we got any ai that is near passing the Turing test yet. Tech layoffs is not a good sign in them continuing with ai development.  Definitely a lot more room for growth, but they will probably wait till after the recession to resume that."

The actual latency would be dependent on your monitor's refresh rate.   A 144hz monitor would only have around 7ms of \"latency\" (a new image is displayed every 7ms).   A cloud platform would have that same latency + the network latency"

The 6/21 date doesn\u2019t really matter to you unless you\u2019re a broker.  You can ignore that.  \n\nSo what does this mean for you?  If you bought Nvidia tomorrow at open, you would still get the split of 4 shares for each share you held.  Doesn\u2019t matter the date you bought, the record date is for the brokers.  I bought Tesla and Apple after the record dates, they still split.  This will too.

Also worth considering, fears about inflation have previously driven down NVDA's price the past few months and might continue to cause volatility in the near-term future. In a vacuum, though, I think NVDA should be a good stock to own longer-term."

The reason is that ARM as an architecture stands to expand into the desktop segment. Apple is transitioning, and Windows has the software support but is lacking the hardware. The merger would give Nvidia control over the architecture and companies like Apple and Qualcomm would have to pay royalties to Nvidia who could at the same time churn out their own ARM chips."

The split news has ran up the price in the last week with no fundamental change to the stock. There are a huge number of people who are buying it for the short term because they think everyone else will be buying it because it's cheap, all trying to sell after the split actually happens. Back to the point of fundamentals, their profit was lower in 2019 and 2020 than in 2018 - this could be fine if they were reinvesting it all, but they aren't. In 2020 their revenue was only about 25% more than in 2018 but their stock price is more than double. They're a great company, but they are too expensive right now.

For example, healthcare companies using AI for drug discovery and personalized medicine, or manufacturing companies using AI to optimize their production processes.  \nAgain, it's important to do your own research and carefully consider the risks and potential rewards of any investment before making a decision."

Right now 100% of these funds are in a general S&P index. We are thinking about selling 80% of that and basically reinvesting in what would essentially be a variety of indexes that make up the S&P, with some of the riskier sectors left out. Plan is to hold these for at least 6 months, possibly longer depending on economy. Let me know what you think.\\n\\n20% S&P index fund,\\nXLK - 5%,\\nXLI - 5%,\\nXLP - 20.25%,\\nXLU - 10%,\\nXLB - 2.5%,\\nXLV - 18%,\\nXLC - 5%,\\nXLE - 5.5%,\\n5% Sin Stocks - BUD, TAP, MO, PM.\\n\\nEssentially were leaving out Financials, Real Estate, and Consumer Discretionary.\\n\\nRemaining 23.75% we plan on using to DCA into individual stocks we like for the long run - Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Semiconductors (Nvidia, AMD, etc), etc.\\n\\nEdit: Just so we are all clear, the bottom 23.75% is for us to DCA into A'",

Most of the time, the winner of the last decade are not the winners of the next one, and by removing sectors you are taking away diversification and thus risk. \n\nFor example Financials do better than during high interest rates as they can offer better spreads to their customer (the difference between the fed interest rate and what they offer the customers). In contrast technology does worse, as their ability to generate loses declines. In high interest rate environments, the hurdle rate for investment increases -  so people are less likely to own companies that start to make money in 10 years. \n\nReal Estate protects against inflation better than tech for examples.\n\nBy reducing sector exposure and buying single companies that are in a single correlated sector, you increase your risk.\n\nIf you want to decrease your risk, you would add emerging markets or other developed markets (Europe, Australia, Japan etc) to your portfolio. You can also add bonds for example."

REITS that I have looked at usually have option premium more like a value stock. But MPW has premium rivaling Tesla and Nvidia.\\n2. High dividends are concerns for several reasons.

It's such minor news it's not even worth mentioning.\n\nIf you believe in NVDA and think they are reasonably priced, there's no reason to sell. Especially because of a stock split. I'm up about +350% on NVDA because I just don't pay attention to the minor news. It doesn't matter when you're a company like NVDA with their market position.\n\nRemember too. If you've held less than a year, you're paying short term capital gains. After taxes, the value you hold in NVDA is not directly transferable to your net worth if you sell. For this reason, you should really be hesitant to sell great companies, even if their evaluation seems a little rich. If you plan to hold companies 10+ years (which I recommend that you do), the company will be overvalued for months, even years, but if the underlying asset is still solid, theres no reason to sell. \n\nImagine if you bought aapl in 2005 and sold everytime you thought it was a little pricy or they had a stock split.

This way if it goes down, then you can buy more and get a better DCA. If it goes up, then you made some profits on what you sold and you still have some to ride the upswing.\n\nIf you believe this is a good long term stock, then sell nothing. Hold on to your shares. If it dips due to a sell-off, then add more to your current position and wait until whatever your long term period is. If the company is good enough, then it will catch up to its \"overhauled\" value.\n\nWhat ever you decide, be sure to learn from your choice.\n\nMy DCA for the stock is $151. I've had it for over 3 years. I consider it one of my core holdings and I plan to hold on to it for another 15 - 20 years, unless the fundamentals change.\n\nA stock split adds no value. The false psychology of equating a lower cost price with a discount is what drives the frenzy (if there is one). In simple terms....if you split/change a dollar into 4 quarters, then you still have a dollar's worth of value. There is no difference between the value of 4 quarters and the value of a dollar bill.\n\nRecall when TSLA split...the stock shot up 40+% over several months following the news and split.\n\nWhen AAPL split, it shot up for a couple of days and then went down. If I would have waited 7-12 days after the split, then I could have bought it at a better price. Instead, it would be several months before I saw any green.\n\nWhen TTD split a couple weeks ago, it slightly went up a point or two over the next 4-5 days and then shot up. I was hoping this one would have behaved like AAPL after the split. Nope. I miss out on this one.\n\nNo one really knows how the stock's price will be affected by the market psychology behind a stock split. Decide on what to do based on the fundamentals of the company. If long term is your view, then the possible frenzy from a stock split will wash out in the long run..."

Before the Nifty Fifty, you could probably point to how the 1929 crash of the Dow didn\u2019t recover until 1954. The Dow blue chips were the original FAANG.

So use logic: the last 12 years were not normal and therefore \"return to the mean\" is inevitable.\n\nAlso, the fed is not a friend of stocks and is raising rates to slow things down. High interest rates become appealing for savers because \"THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE\" is in play.

Same with 2008. Excpet 2008 was so bad that it rook all the gov'ts energy to stop ot from becoming a depression. Liquidity basically didn't exist after that. That's why we wnet from normal monetary policy to ZIRP and QE.\n\nThe deflative power of 2008 was so bad those two policies didn't even cause a >2%, inflation rate for a decade. Then when it did, the feds started trying to raise rates and the executive administration at the time pressured the treasury to pivot so the market was green for the 2020 elections. After 2020 we went full on helicopter money...\n\nLong story short, there was a debt accrued for saving the economy in 2008. The govt never relieved that debt when it could have, and then accrued more debt in 2020. That debt will suck up liquidity again and cause deflation tk run rampant, and if it happens during a recession as we're entering right now, it can turn it into the very depression the govt tried to stop in 2008. Any economist will tell you deflation is far more dangerous than inflation.\n\nThat's what everyone is afraid of. We have a ticking time bomb in the federal debt pile and just as it's reaching maturity we're entering a recession. This could nuke the american economy for decades. That's what's different."

     "[Here is a full set of graphs with labels for different time periods, showing the performance of different US/international allocations in terms of return/standard deviation (risk)](https://imgur.com/a/tj0ygmE). Make sure to read the imgur labels for the first two as they cover different time periods.\n\nTakeaway: In some periods, either over entire decades or even 3 decades, a 100% international portfolio gave you more return, though with a lot more volatility (i.e., risk) than 100% US. In other decades, 100% US had better returns, and with less volatility than 100% international (but more than 70/30 split). But over the entire period, 100% US wins, in large part due to post-09 outerformance.\n\nBut generally, if you want to overall do well across your lifetime, it seems a 20-30% allocation to international is suitable. Your goal is to get as high return for as little tradeoff in volatility (i.e., somewhere near the top left corner, unless you can get a lot farther to the top by going a little to the right). Such a split will make sure you're not at the bottom of the curve in periods like 1970-2006, but it may come at the cost of not being at the very top of the curve.\n\nRight now the risk/reward tradeoff is better outside the US based on historic PEs, and I do *not* mean just comparing PE of ex-US to US, but comparing the relative PE of ex-US/US to its historic levels. That is, the ratio (PE of ex-US)/(PE of US) over time. (Obviously the PE should be lower for Europe, but no reason to think it should be at some of the highest percentiles of cheapness in history right now). It's also important not to fall for the fallacy that the strongest economies = best stock performance. Higher GDP growth in the US does not mean it will have better stock returns, just like higher GDP growth in emerging markets doesn't translate to better returns. Though it is a good indicator. \n\nI personally take a concentrated bet by a big tilt not just to ex-US stocks, which are cheap, but small cap value ex-US stocks. This is the cheap of the cheap, the deepest value of the equity styles (large/mid/small and value/blend/growth). So I'm definitely pushing for the top/right parts of the curve since I'm accepting higher volatility."

They can keep buying the dip because to them it doesn't matter whether the market goes down or starts to rally. It's opportunity cost that people are consciously making; buy more equities because there's nothing else that they need their money for.\n\nAdditionally, depending on the size of your account and your account type, it may not be feasible at all to sell everything and wait for a better opportunity. Someone who has 6-8 figures in a taxable brokerage account isn't going to be able to sell everything without incurring a massive tax penalty for doing so. Many people who have these accounts simply borrow capital from their stocks and never sell; in a year like this, the best option for them would be to borrow less than they normally do or pay down some of their short cash position (High Net Worth individuals typically call this strategy buy, borrow, die, with the idea that you don't pay capital gains during your lifetime).\n\nOutside of Reddit, when I talk to people that I know (medicine, tech, finance, and construction industries primarily), wages are decent right now, bonuses are still on the table for most people (depending on how the rest of the year unfolds), and lay-offs haven't been any different than any other year (many Fortune 500 companies have annual layoffs in the fall as part of their typical business cycles). For these folks, it's business as usual. Lots of companies are still hiring strategically. On Reddit, there appears to be a different story brewing (e.g. wages are bad, layoffs are en masse, panic is setting in, etc.); this likely points to people being in different industries who are experiencing a different economy.\n\nI don't think that buying the dip will fall out of favor. I think that the people who are buying are doing so consciously.\n\nGood luck to all!"

I find it more likely we go through a period of time where the markets are relatively flat and pes that have been expanding since 2008 slowly catch back up to averages. I think dividend stocks with growth will continue to do well once the market bottoms and we go range bound for a bit. Something like a MSFT with a little dividend/ share buybacks/ decent growth I think will do decent especially if we see another 10% ish pull down. DCA into company\u2019s that you use daily and understand and keep a minimum 25-50% in index\u2019s and keep some cash on the sides and you will do great in the coming years."

If ANY other index was surging the way we see DXY is surging, people would be tripping over themselves to be in it. I suspect that because \"dollar strength\", though, is such a nebulous concept for most of us nobody really cares.\n\nFor you, me, and any other average investor, the 10% increase in DXY we have seen over the last 3 months doesnt really amount to much. We just dont have enough cash for it to really matter. Particularly in the face of high inflation. For these investment groups, companies, and banks with hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, though? That 10% increase in dollar strength is meaningful. It makes zero sense for them to move off of cash positions until they start seeing prolonged evidence of the dollar strength stopping its run. This last week just closed with the dollar increasing by its largest single numerical candle increase, and among its largest percentage increases, that it has seen during the bull run its been on since last summer. Its not slowing, its still maintaining. \n\nDCA is still, by far, the most effective method for us low money investors, and that's going to hold true no matter what. However, until we see the dollar strength show prolonged evidence of slowing it just makes no sense for the big money that determines the direction of the market to start pouring enough in to spark a new bull run. Just my thoughts, and what my personal investing plan right now is built around. Everyone is more than welcome to disagree, but I just decided it was a thought worth sharing."

In a bull market you can expect your dip purchases to go green relatively quickly.

     "Buying the dip historically works when it's not a recession. Recessions are multiple months long and will often have more than 1 bear market rallies. A buying the dip strategy where the contribution grows as the price (and market) decreases toward a mean valuation will be a more successful variant to blindly buying the dip.  All stock strategies will have flaws as no one truly can see the future, but if the premise is simply buying something cheaper today than it was yesterday, then only time can determine the successfulness of the strategy. Since mean regression suggests a CAPE of 15 is roughly the 60 year average, that still suggests the market can drop below \"fair value\" due simply to the time in overpriced territory still leading to a short term unsuccessful strategy.\n\nEdit: Moreover, the mean CAPE over the past 40 years suggests a flaw in the value of 15 or the market has been inflated for nearly 40 years. This isn't to suggest shiller is wrong, but the market has a lot more participants with a lot more debt, huge passive index investing environment and more complicated financial products (think derivative, sub prime loans, shadow banking, etc) than we did 40-50 years ago. Either the CAPE would need to fall for a sustained period below 15 or a new mean should be used."

Sure, the markets will likely overreact to the downside, and then recover a bit about a week later, but won't ADBE, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, etc, etc, all be EVEN LOWER after Jerome spooks everybody next week?\\n\\nWhy are people buying right now?

Currently those go for about 30 bucks wholesale. If you get a 20% off sale and they are $24 are you going to wait to see if they go 30% off? I'm not I'm buying some at 20% off and I'll buy more at 30% off and if it gets really crazy and we get 40 or 50% off I'll use all my remaining capital and then some. \n\nIt's a lot easier if you stay connected to the fact that you're buying assets not news stories. Not headlines. Not knee-jerk reactions on the day some event happens. The one that blew up after hours today, FedEx. Trading 170s. If that thing gets in the 140s. I don't know about you guys but I'm buying. You just have to develop levels on the assets you want and why they make sense to you. If you're buying an asset for $200 and the only reason you buy it is because you think it's going to $250 you're going to have a lot of problems if it goes to 150. You're going to sell it and then you're going to wonder why you bought it in the first place. This is the cycle that blows up most novice traders. Buy stuff you actually want to own. It makes the drawdowns a lot easier. Just my opinion here but the one stock I would absolutely not touch is NVIDIA. I would be buying Intel hand over fist before I touch Nvidia. Why? Because crypto has driven Nvidia for the past 5 to 6 years. Eth going pos. We have no idea what that will do to the Dynamics of Nvidia but we do know what Nvidia looked like in 2015 and it was a hell of a lot lower than where it currently is. Will there be another alt that catches on? There could be will it drive cards like ethereum? Maybe, I absolutely would not front run that. that's just me though."

Nvidia said that more than 70 laptop manufacturers would offer gaming laptops that use the companys next-generation Ampere architecture.

I feel investors should really start looking outside the US. it's just a matter of time before the dollar collapses. Latin America is where I'm setting my eye. Also I'm Keeping an eye on the small cap CSV. It's a funeral service company that's aggressively aquiring all the mom and pop funeral homes. It's been really beat up recently. For chips I've been doing well with LAM research  and KlAC. It makes more sense to me to look into the Semiconductor equipment manufacturers. In trying to stick with a 15 or less holdings portfolio.

Remember: So far Tesla have tested exactly 0 (ZERO) miles of autonomous driving in California. \n\nMusk is grasping at straws again, after lots all around the states are filling up with unbought Teslas and the company is financially overexposed. In fact, unless he finds new financing, cashflow is gonna dry up in summer this year already.\n\nAt the event he also said that he's commiting 100% of Teslas current capital to autonomous driving from now on - which means he atleast admitted to canceling Roadster 2, Semi, Pickup and Model Y. Couple of his other promises that of course never came true.\n\nAlso a variant of the new 14 nm hardware was first introduced in an iphone in 2015.

     ">Nvidia #NVDA an expensive P/S ratio, but a reasonable P/E given its excellent profit margins.\n\nSince when is 23x P/S and over 130 P/E \"reasonable\" for a company that has negative growth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Generational AI growth is definitely not a panacea, but has started to gain traction as use cases expand beyond ChatGPT.\n\nThe problem is that NVDA lost the revenues from the crypto space +. many companies already upgraded their clusters during the pandemic or to compete in the meta verse. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Besides, higher performance computing is becoming a must have.\n\nOnly for a few things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u2022 Its Auto segment is doing extremely well, gaming rebounding, and data center still growing.\n\nGaming was down 46% YoY. That it was up in the quarter that included Q4 is normal. Professional Visualization and OEM down as well. Yes auto is strong, but data center is up only 11% YoY and down 6% QoQ. For a company that prices in 30% growth for a decade that is too little. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Nvidia's new product innovation and exceptional R&D spend allow it to keep its pole position.\n\nYes. The problem is that Nvdia already is the dominant force in their sectors. That means one is betting on 30% growth of those industries. Given that interest rates are 5% now, and the bank that used to give loans to many startups is now bust, I doubt that a 30% growth will happen. \n\n>then better than expected Q1-FY24 guidance\n\nThey guided Q1 lower than that last year. Not sure where it was better than expected, given the valuation."

That's a way that big and mean players get to become even bigger and meaner, as they get to write their own rules.

There isn't any other data coming out soon to sway the market until the next month's FOMC meeting and cpi numbers. If the next fed meeting goes well and we only raise rates a half point and then the cpi numbers come out confirming that inflation is in fact starting to fall, than there will be a huge probability that we see an end to this bear market. I'm not convinced yet, as Powell's last meeting didn't show any sign of him budging, mid terms elections are pretty much over with no \"red wave\", and keep in mind there is a real possibility that the next numbers might actually come in hot. So in other words, we go up or down. But seriously, be patient and keep your eye on the news."

After that, I know 4100 is on the top end of a lot of analysts range\u2026 good resistance at 3900-3915. If we get two closes about that level it\u2019s higher to that 41 handle, but if it\u2019s rejected then we pause until next months data.. possible PCE or FOMC as a catalyst before that. Ultimately though, we should be down to 3200 in a realistic world. Lots of forward expectations have to work out perfectly for these values to be justified historically.\n\nHaving said all that: tomorrow? Something in me says we should be lower for consolidation. But the indexes hit the highs of the day on the close; there are simply no more sellers and the buyers have taken control. Most people are expecting a consolidation day, and there\u2019s still a lot of pessimism and bearishness\u2026 so I\u2019ll say big up day tomorrow. +2.5% $COMP +1.8% $SPX +350 on the Dow."

     "Corporations will not pay the tax in the end. Consumers, hence taxpayers will. Inventors, industrialists, and entrepreneurs got to where they are because they paid the price up front by risking their own livelihood and welfare, innovating, sacrificing their resources up-front, leading others to produce, etc. They gathered others, the people, to become employees, because those employees obviously couldn\u2019t and still can\u2019t do what they did to get to where they are. The workers, the people, the consumers, the ones that the companies employed, got them there, but it was the leaders/owners of those companies that hit the employees there. Corporations begin with one to a few determined people. It will be the people, the employees, the workers, that will keep the companies running by paying taxes for those companies. Yes, those same employees will pay the taxes on behalf of the companies. The money will just be redistributed by politicians, lawmakers, scam artists, liars, thieves, they are. Democrats never get the fact that corporate heads aren\u2019t idiots. That\u2019s right. We all know The Democratic Party is the \u201ctax more, toll more, and take more party.\u201d Businesses will move their companies out of the country, or just sell to foreign investors and cash out. Read Atlas Shrugged. Producers quit when their resources are taken. Champions stop playing the game when you make rules so that \u201ceveryone wins.\u201d If they stay in business after being levied a 15% corporate tax, they will increase prices to cover inflation, thus driving inflation higher. A friend of ours showed us a receipt from a restaurant last weekend that had a new charge on it, \u201cTemporary Inflation Fee.\u201d Hmm. Who\u2019s paying that? The restaurant? No the customer is. The rich are rich because they are always smart to figure out how to get out of paying more, whether it be taxes or more for their raw materials, if they are manufacturers. If restaurants pay more for food and fuel, they increase prices. As stupid as Trump was and is, he said something very honest that every successful business tycoon knows, but doesn\u2019t have the balls to say, \u201cPaying less taxes doesn\u2019t make me a bad person. It makes me smart.\u201d Do you want to give more of your money to the US government and let them manage it? Really. How good of a job have they been doing the last 20 years or so? We would be in jail if we stole like they do. The deficit is like an out of control water meter, spinning endlessly. The hydrant is open full blast and it\u2019s flowing dollars with high pressure. WE are the source of those dollars. The American workers. So, WE will pay those corporate taxes. Not the corporations. Votes to raise taxes are votes to speed up the bleeding process toward the death of a democracy. Free childcare, healthcare, education, job training, food, gas, housing, etc, etc. Free? Who\u2019s paying the bill? We are. We\u2019re paying with our freedom to generate more money by giving more tax money to dishonest, disloyal, and disgusting people. Remember something\u2026\u201dCompanies make money. Politicians take money.\u201d Politicians produce nothing, but policies filled with words. Words that further enslave the ones \u201cfor whom the policies are written.\u201d"

The article mentions:\n\n>Intel's Xe discrete GPUs are a new generation of graphics processors introduced in late 2020 and early 2021.\n\nThose are not the same as the ARC models released last year to compete with mid range GPUs. The Xe are scaled up versions of their integrated cards, I thought even the Xe ones were integrated. \n\nRumors I heard was ARC was cancelled cause they lose their 1200 developers in Russia. \n\nIntel has always had a lead in GPUs since many of their CPUs now ship with an integrated GPU which is good enough for most ppl. Its the dGPU market where their share is 0, and the Xe GPUs are also not sold for desktops, its only for laptops/prebuilt systems:\n\n[https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/discrete-gpus/iris-xe-aic.html](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/discrete-gpus/iris-xe-aic.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't go to Bestbuy and buy these things, so its not really a true stat just like how Intel sells the most GPUs annually since all their CPUs come with one."

I invested in a small company with a great product and huge plans, but scaling up production is difficult and when it didn't work out, the stock dropped 90%. Likewise, there are plenty of companies (*cough* GM *cough*) that are talking about their plans everyday, but not executing whatsoever and going bankrupt as a result. So the lesson here is that, unless a company has an amazing track record of executing on plans, look at what they're doing, not what they say they will do.\n* Unlike what people say around here, diversifying by owning more stocks is not safer. As a retail investor, and especially when just starting out, you don't have time to truly follow more than a handful of companies. It's much safer to own 1 or 2 stocks you know really well, than 10 stocks you only know the basics of."

     "So I'm just a novice, but this is advice I get from\nmy successful father every time I try and talk\nstocks with him. People only enjoy trading\nbecause they enjoy money. It is an unnatural\nprofession. People enjoy hobby's via their\npassions.... Woodworking, skiing, cooking, etc. all\nof which can never be fully mastered and one\nmay spend a lifetime pursuing greatness in.\nStocks on the other hand, are not interesting at\nall, well atleast to 99.99999% of the population,\neven 99.999% of an educated population, the\nONLY reason it is popular is because SOME\npeople make money doing it. So his point is, if\none can never be too good at something, why\nwaste the time and energy on something that\nisn't your passion? The opportunity cost of\ninvesting in individual stocks is that it takes time\nand money away from perfecting your actual\ncraft, hobby, or profession. A boat craftsman\nloses out on his primary skills every second he\nwastes trying to understand the stock market,\nespecially \"better\" than others. Why not invest in\nthe S&P 500 and never look at stocks, and be\nable to advance your self personally and\nprofessionally, become more skilled, and live and\nenjoyable fulfilling life. Instead of reading 10k's\nand worrying all the time. It's that simple.\nSpecialize, find what you like or you are good at\nand grind endlessly at it. Stop and enjoy life,\npursue new skills. There are some brainiacs that\ngenuinely enjoy trading and finance, but from my\npersonal opinion there are less of those in the\nworld than there are people in this sub. So yeah,\ntake it from my main man, and myself trying to\nfollow on his footsteps. Enjoy life, never stop\ngrinding, pursue your passions, and don't let distractions get to you, because unless you're a\nprofessional, even investing can be a distraction.\nGood luck to all of you."

Operating Earnings down 77% last quarter, QoQ Growth in Datacenters is stalling and it trades at 3x historic multiple when they had good 15% growth."

     "No. There's a good chance that we are seeing a regime change - people continuing to rely on \"what worked over the last decade\" may be disappointed.\n\nPeople should have a reasonable % of their portolio in tech, not have a tech fund. It's not no tech, but maybe you have 20-25% of your portfolio in tech (S and P 500 is about 24% tech), not 100% or anything remotely near that. Additionally, I think even with technology there has to be a little bit of a move away from the giant \"household names\"; some tech exposure should be finding medium sized tech names that are working/can work in this environment. \n\nI don't own it but look at Aspen Technology, which is up this year because of what it focuses on - look at the industries on its website who are the customers and look what industries have done better this year. The stock has also done pretty well over the last couple decades. You can have some major household names as tech exposure, but branch out a bit. Doesn't have to be that, but there are some things in tech that are working. \n\nThe era of easy monetary policy that powered a lot of tech gains over the last decade isn't coming back for a while, which Powell restated yesterday. Not something I'm thrilled with but if that's the case people have to adapt. I'd love for this to be a period where we get through it, the pivot happens and the growth party starts again but the longer this goes on the more unrealistic that feels/I don't see the conditions coming together for that happening. Feels like best case is the eventual recovery looks more 2002 post dot com.\n\nWorth a read - \n\nhttps://citywire.com/pro-buyer/news/nothing-is-always-good-rajiv-jain-s-warning-for-growth-pms/a2391677 (\"\u2018Nothing is always good\u2019: Rajiv Jain\u2019s warning for growth PMs\")"

Mexico is the future for most new factory jobs coming to North America. There will be some niche industry's that move into the US, particularly energy intensive ones such as battery production (especially with the Inflation Reduction Act). I could definitely see states with low electricity rates, such as Texas, taking advantage of America's relative energy security. I suspect that much of Europe's energy intensive industries will essentially decamp from the continent and accelerate factory development in the US. Europe is a couple of decades behind Japan in this, but their demographics are similar and energy security virtually non-existent."

Widespread reshoring will only happen in the short term with some pretty drastic populist protectionist legislation and will result in a large drop in the return of capital. Not only do I believe this will have a dramatic impact on the economy overall, more importantly the oligarchic nature of American Politics will strongly resist this happening, I think they would rather risk a populist revolution than allow populist legislation to pass, at least that has been the trend of history.\n\nIf we can keep the boat of western democracy afloat and climate change doesn't cause to much of a crisis, in time reshoring will gradually happen as wages and standards of living reach some sort of equilibrium across the globe. This mean a reduction in real wages in western democracy in and an increase in developing nations.\n\nPersonally I think we are screwed."

One thing multiple founders of Oculus mentioned repeatedly is that when a person has a positive experience in VR, meaning they truly experience presence with no motion sickness, then they will crave returning to that experience. In other words, when VR is done right, it will become addictive. I believe Zuckerberg also believes that which is why he is pumping billions of dollars into it.

Being able to walk around something (engineering) and view it from different angles and interact with it and zoom in on it from the comfort of your house would be a massive educational tool. Yes you can do these things in person, but having a fully functional virtual airplane that has a complete working engine and all engine parts that you can practice working on and having the ability to autoscrew something in or remove panelling with the flick of your wrist and reset it to how it was before you started tinkering with it with the simplicity of a menu button click.

I would probably be willing to pay a $400 headset up front, and a monthly $30-50 fee to have access to good versions of these.

Millennials will finally have their Gen X moment and be able to say \"see, you feel old too!\".  \n\nAnd if that doesnt happen, It's already started to show potential to revolutionize gaming and casual fitness. Each Gen will test a new use case and perfect or monetize an old one that was proven out.  How far and where it goes will determine if it becomes the type of cash cow meta is dreaming of above. Theyre clearly shooting for something like that with this positioning though -  currently it's proving concept but largely costing meta money and feeding steam revenue.  \n\nZuk doesn't have a bad track record and he's far from the only one betting on there being enough of a cance of this not just being the gimmicky trend stuck in the early 2020s zeitgeist to put some resources amd tallent into it.

     "I'm not going to do the research and math behind it but obviously Zuck thinks the probability weighted DCF is worth burning money. The way I'd go about calculating it is you say it'll take x years to get setup, another x years to build up a user base, and x years to begin monetizing. Let's say 7, 5, and 2 years. Now I would calc a DCF to that point in time 14 years from now. And within that DCF I would discount each of those CFs by my estimated probably of the metaverse actually taking off. So I'm my assumptions before that point I would build my DCF as if it is fact that the metaverse will be a thing in the future.\n\nNow that I have my NPV for the meatsverse 14 years from today I would estimate all of the costs leading up to that point, bring all the cashflows back (do not discount the capital outlays by probably because those will 100% happen since Zuck is 100% certain he wants to pursue the project (revenues can fail, costs don't, if anything they will be higher than anticipated)) and badabing badaboom you've got the NVP of the metaverse which Zuck obviously thinks is worthwhile\n\nSomething to note is that this is a project Zuck is very passionate about and his underlying assumptions shouldn't be trusted because he is looking through rose tinted glasses.\n\nBut let's say bull case does come true and the world falls in love with the metaverse similar to the Ernest Cline novel \"Ready Player One\", the value of owning the virtual world that everyone has adopted is astronomical. Cosmetic micro transactions, transaction fees for third party developers to sell within your metaverse (like how apple and Google charge for transactions on their app stores), premium access, ad space within an infinitely large virtual world, hardware sales. If it takes off there is a lot of money to be made. \n\nBear case, you spent a lot of money to develop really good VR tech that you can probably sell/license to try and recoup costs but I doubt it would make enough to justify the spend"

In that way the metaverse stuff makes sense, but is so fresh that it's unclear who will lead that revolution. It's unlikely to be an established company.

     "Metaverse isn't just video chats with avatars. The metaverse is putting on a pair of glasses in the morning so that you can get google maps overlaid on your field of view while you're travelling, make it miles better than a GPS. The metaverse is sitting in an e-cafe with your friends, before deciding to play a VR game together that you can literally walk to from the cafe, and after that going for a walk on the beach while chatting and coming across others doing the same thing. The metaverse is scrolling through facebook while wearing your VR sunglasses as you're walking along. \n\nThe metaverse is just going one step further than a mobile phone. It is about making tech a greater aspect of our lives through wearing glasses that make life a mix of reality and VR, such that you never actually need to take off the VR glasses. [These are the glasses that Facebook released recently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkpFqbpa0Zk). They don't have any VR capability (yet), but you can see the kind of thing that ZUCC is thinking of having in 10 or so years. \n\nThe point of the metaverse is to integrate facebook's software into our lives in such a way as to never actually come off it. With any social media currently, the second you put your phone away it's gone. With the metaverse, you'll be able to interface with social media just by having a pair of glasses on, making it much easier to stay online in perpetuity. The double-whammy that META have here is that they can use the hardware they're developing for the metaverse to host a facebook operating system, making them less beholden to the interests of companies that host their software and apps, such as Apple. It's all very dystopian imo and I hate the whole idea, but I think it will make a fuckton of money."

But we could have AI predicted expressions that accurately convey our sentiment in the very near future. \n\nAs for a billion, that's a low estimate if they get it right. Imagine a limitless world full of wonder, excitement, and connection. And then their are the AI applications. With everything tracked and stored, you could instantly visit with a VR copy of anyone. Imagine being able to see your dead spouse, a perfect recreation. It will have an AI curating everything you see. The best part is it will have a negligible carbon footprint and you can do it in a very small climate controlled room. When the world gets harder to live in, we will have this ready alternative.\n\nFor this thought experiment you need to assume it will be more comfortable. That's a hurdle it will absolutely need to overcome. But once it's as comfortable as sitting in the non-VR room, with all the things there for you to see, why wouldn't you go? Have you imagined what a real VR movie experience will be like? To be in the room with the actors, see them from every angle, be part of the action. The beauty is that once some of the initial hardware problems get solved, AI based software solutions should do the rest. \n\nHonestly, I don't think it will be better.

People text message.\n\nSure, your boss or teacher may insist on you getting on Zoom, but really that's because they want to surveil you, it's not because people prefer video chat.\n\nReddit (and much of the larger tech obsessed world) suffers from a logical fallacy that \"any technology that can be imagined will eventually be realized, and that any technology that is realized will be mass adopted.\" Blockchain, VR, metaverse, etc... While those technologies will probably have niche uses and small communities of diehard fans, there is zero inevitability that they will ever get mass adoption."

Chances are it won't get there, but chances are it will. And if it does, it's gonna start a new era. Personally, I believe it will develop, on the B2B side at least. As for the Metaverse Zuck is envisioning, that's gonna be a whole bit more difficult. \n\nThat said, the possibilities if it succeeds are boundless, and eventually everyone will have their part in it, just like the internet. \n\nThere will obviously be places to buy and sell, there will obviously be the gaming side. There will be porn. There's eventually gonna be stuff like virtual vacations even. Ever wanted to explore Iran but either didn't have the money or were afraid of terrorism? Well, if the Metaverse as Zuck envisions it comes to be, you will be able to. And all of these are very superficial things. It really could span a range from \"nich\u00e9 and mainly B2B\" (which I am very confident will develop at least) to \"literally a second life that everyone spends hours upon hours per day on\"."

Seeing how it might work best and organically growing. \n\nThe meta version is more like a holodeck in Star Trek. Gamers are the first ones to understand how it could become huge. \n\nYou\u2019ll interact w others and be in that virtual space for many hours. \n\nIt can be gaming. It can be education. Health. Therapy. Love. Fun. Social. Business. \n\n\nFor sci-fi nuts like me , it\u2019s very obvious the amazing opportunities it can have at every level \nof life. \nFrom having a boring corporate meeting on a nice beach with your boss on the other side of the world, to teaching kids history with interactive movie with a teacher infront. \n\nMeta versi\u00f3n going all In is definitely a bad move imo. They are turning into yahoo where it has tons of apps and side biz that no one knows and fail. Hardware wise also. \nThe idea is no bad per se, it\u2019s just fb doesn\u2019t have the best track record for many things they are trying to do. \n\nThey could be focusing on other things like a Shopify competitor, making fb watch a standalone biz to compete vs YouTube. Have a free email service and other ways to harvest more customer data outside apples privacy wall. \n\nBut mark seeks to have been playing too much video games and want to do that full inmersive metaverse. And gave us a cartoon world in his keynote. \n\nSo I think either Apple or some random company will do better. Like when zoom became the pandemic sensation on a tech we all clearly thought the big faang should have had.\n\nIt\u2019s plus it\u2019s obvious meta wants to become the platform for it and charge people.

If you recall, right before they became meta, FB was getting raked over the coals in the press for data security, enabling all kinds of bad shit, being bad for mental health, ignoring internal content guidelines, letting big names get free passes on content, etc. There was talk about anti trust investigations. Suddenly that all vanished, right after they rebranded and got people to talk about something else. Flushing a couple billion a year down the drain on an eternal development project that is actually just advertising is a really good ROI that helped them side step much bigger problems.  \n\nI expect anything they make out of this to be about as fun as a mandatory HR training video."

Surgeons could do practice runs on rare operations before cutting on a person (or the medical school could simulate unexpected complications). In addition, training people to perform  other jobs where the price of errors is high becomes much easier if you can put them into  a digital environment.\n\nUltimately, metaverse technology should be able to allow  a person to do anything you've seen done in the holodeck in Star Trek (or seen implied off screen, if you catch my drift) with sufficient technological development.  The pieces and parts are all there to do what needs to be done but they're not developed enough to do it well yet.\n\nWhat Meta is looking to do is get in on the ground floor so that everything that comes later is built on their tech.

It puts weight on your face, it makes you too warm, and my eyes get fatigued staring at that screen for an extended period of time.\r  \n\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of these problems are a direct result of how young the tech is. All of these problems are being actively worked on and will disappear in less than a decade as long as money keeps flowing into the technology.\n\nFatigue is a result of the weight, the low resolution, and the visual-vestibular dissonance.\n\nWeight is getting lower, resolution is getting higher, FOV is getting bigger, screen door effect is disappearing. Nausea and vertigo might be controlled with vestibular stimulation, but even if that doesn't become mainstream, it only really applies to games (Where you move around a lot but your body doesn't). That means sure, gaming might not be a thing you do for a full day at a time, but social apps and virtual office spaces might become something that's as easy to stay in as a real physical space, when all other problems are solved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Furthermore, with a video chat, you see the actual person, not just some animated cartoony looking version of them. With a video chat, you see a person's subtle facial expressions, whereas the metaverse characters only pick up body movements and I don't see how they'd ever get to the point where they can pick up on every little facial expression that an actual video can pick up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, this is a lack of vision. People who try VRchat don't sing praises about Omegle. People who try Horizons work environments prefer it over video calls. Sure, they might complain about the sweat and heat and weight and resolution, but those are all problems that will be solved relatively quickly. \n\nThe next generation Meta headsets will  capture your facial expressions with fidelity comparable to that of an NPC animation in a video game. Full realistic face scans will be next (and this will happen in this decade, the only limiting factor here is the processing power of the device or the streaming bandwidth)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\r\rI do think the metaverse can produce some really fun gaming opportunities, although I still feel they're a bit gimmicky. I have noticed that Mark Zuckerberg seems to focus primarily on the business application of the metaverse. I just don't understand how the metaverse can convince any significant number of businesses to buy metaverse equipment and get into the whole metaverse, when we already have video chat capabilities.\n\nThe equipment is cheaper than renting an office, it's cheaper than paying people to commute. It's cheaper than flying people from different countries for in-person meetings (there are vital parts of the work that can't be done via Zoom but can be done with accurate 3D scans of offices and products).\n\nStartups right now look for talent all over the world. VR allows people to work in a shared space without the office expenses, the commute expenses, etc etc. This will be embraced by startups. Initially VR-focused startups, but eventually others looking to expand without increasing costs significantly.\n\n  \n\n\n>I believe Zuckerberg is a smart guy, but I don't understand how going ALL IN on the metaverse can possibly be a good idea. Obviously there are other players in the metaverse space (not just Meta/Facebook), but Meta seems to the the furthest along and they're pouring billings of dollars into this. The thing is, I think the traditional Facebook businesses are a solid investment. Their \"Reels\" are growing very rapidly. 50% of the time people spend on facebook is on videos...a lot of that is Reels. 20% of time on Instagram is on Reels. They're fighting back well against Tiktok. But the fact that they've changed their name to Meta and they're going all in on the Metaverse makes it impossible for me to invest.\n\nI don't know if Meta will be the ones to get to a VR future. Maybe. He's trying to fund his experimental business by attaching it to a profitable but fickle social media business. Social media popularity wanes with its social generations. New 18 year-olds aren't jumping on facebook, they need a social media where their parents aren't, and they're also the people who are going to spend the most disposable income in the next decade. There's a high risk that Zuckerberg won't be able to just buy the next big social media, and he probably knows it, which is why he's going a step further hunting the thing future kids will want to be in."

If FED is raising rates, the market will have a hard time going up. If FED is cutting, the market will act irrational.\n\nAt your age, you should think in decades. Buy slowly as market goes down. You will end up with lower average cost per share and then just hold long term as long as the company is doing well. If something major happens with the company than review why you bought and make adjustments.\n\nJust my opinion, but AMD is a bit less risky. INTC is going though some major changes. If it works they will be a great company to hold. I like the new CEO but I am not sure if the rest of the company has changed enough yet. \n\nBest of luck."
