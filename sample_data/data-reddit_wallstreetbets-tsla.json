The idea that it would dissappear by morning had me checking my app nonstop to look at AH action and watched futures all night and I remember thinking \"this is too much\" I didn't like the feeling, I mean obviously a ton of money is always nice but trading is too much for me.  \n\nI do 5k-10k options per week now to deal with it as I love the action but man oh man your post brought me right back to January 2021.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nanyways man I wish you the best and hope you can repeat the success you almost made and even more !"

     "For those don\u2019t understand how this guy made money or don\u2019t fully understand \u201copening/buying long/bullish calls\u201d.. read on.\n\nHe decided to purchase TSLA $240 Long Call options when it the stock was approx $225 (aka the underlying) on Wednesday, with 2 days till expiration, for $1.26.  He knew that if it didn\u2019t go above $240 by 48 hours he would lose it all.  \n\n\nFortunately, during the time of the screenshot, TSLA was trading around $249, his prediction that TSLA would exceed $240 was correct with a value of $9 per option contract, he paid $1.26 per.  \n\nHe didn\u2019t exercise the option because he doesn\u2019t have the funds to do so.\n\nInstead, he just sold the options to someone else who probably exercised it, not that it matters to him.\n\nSo basically, the stock (underlying) went up 10% in 48 hours & the odds of predicting that correctly is highly unlikely, therefore the large payday.  Again, he has 48 hours since he chose that timeframe to sell (close) them at whatever value he wishes but since time is the enemy, if the stock does not move in the direction he thinks then his call option will rapidly lose value as the market will see it more & more unlikely to reach the 240 mark.  Vice versa, because the stock began to rise, his option begun to increase in value as it became more & more likely to reach & exceed that mark."

Clearly it\u2019s overbought, a pull back is due and the recent uptrend of consecutive up days is unprecedented, however, stocks like Tesla defy reason and play mostly with the FOMO crowd at this level and it seems like Musk is doing everything he can to regain the trillion dollar valuation again.  I would not bet against the richest man in the world and the support of the US government with subsidies and incentives.   My opinion is we trend up and down until we see 300 and correct back to a trading range of 245/300 until Q 3 when we regain the 350+ range and trillion dollar valuation.\n\nDon\u2019t trade on this post - only my opinion."

Since holding it, I have had no regrets and instead of seeing the drops as times I \"should have seen it coming\" as times to buy more.

The AI investor does not have a lot of places to go, NVDA is already thru the f***ing roof, and the markets are anxious for some more of the AI piece of the pie. Many AI stocks are purely meme stocks. Tesla is extremely underpriced if they happen to put out a fully autonomous vehicle by the end of the year / first quarter of 2024. They are not a simple EV car manufacturer, They have robotics, AI, software, they have more user data than any other car company..: Elon owns other tech companies that could massively benefit Tesla products and services in the future. I would never buy stocks of a car company in 2023 but Tesla is not just a car company. Just my opinion, but I think tesla at least is worth what NVDA is worth right now at around 432, my bet is Tesla is going to reach 300 very fast like in 2 weeks, and it will be worth at least 350 by the end of this year. That is my personal opinion and the reason I\u2019m loading up on tesla, don\u2019t trade based on this."

     "Understand the rational mechanics behind sentiment, because individual emotions are irrational but group behavior is predictable.\n\n-\tConsistent output delivers slow growth. Consistency is safe (good), but also boring (bad).\n-\tOverabundance initially generates better prices, which improves sentiment but inflates value to unrealistic levels. This creates both a bull and bear case unless followed by industrial output.\n-\tScarcity always follows a rush to abundance. Sentiment sours when need can't be met, but in two different ways. If scarcity is partial, it increases percieved value. If scarcity is total, the company cannot deliver and sentiment tanks instead.\n-\tGroundbreaking news delivers immediate sentiment spikes (Microsoft/OpenAi)\n-\tLackluster responses to groundbreaking news delivers immediate dips (Google)\n-\tFundamentally both of the prior return to the status quo, because there is a distinct worth disparity between an innovation and actual application of it to a real purpose. The former is speculative worth, the latter is real worth.\n-\tVery bad news causes an immediate dip in sentiment, like an oil spill (Enron/Exxon/BP/etc)\n-\tDespite doing awful stuff, a company already anchored into infrastructure should always be expected to recover after a spanking. We are all still reliant on their services, and that need does not go away. These are excellent speculative positions, for instance BP still had exclusive contracts with the pentagon for decades, which is a guaranteed return. Whether we are mad at them or not does not really change that.\n-\tA fluff company cannot recover from a spanking. Their product didn't matter, and the hype is gone, which was their only momentum.\n-\tIf you can't find a good investment idea, bet on whoever is quietly working on the main thing the world needs right now.\n-\tIf you can't find a good speculative position, bet on the poker chip factory, not the casino. Gambling returns are shaky, but gambling as a whole has a consistent demand. Poker chips satisfy the casino's needs, gambling satisfies a want. Needs hold more worth than wants.\n-\tTrust seasonal sentiment because we are creatures of habit. Retail is a good bet leading up to holiday shopping. Oil is a good bet in the winter. Travel is good in the summer. Bet on what people do when they do it.\n-\tDo not neglect your own individual bias, and check your own shit. You are human and also have irrational sentiment, and it is very easy not to remember that money not lost is as good as profit."

Yes it fucking does, f off idiot if you think no. \n\nIs this a car stock???\n\n\nNo it's not a car stock, it's a Ai stock, infrastructure, computation of multiple factors.

So 7.5B is roughly 35%. If these subsidies stack directly that is 105% subsidized (for Texas at least). Additionally if the new deal isn\u2019t percentage based, the economies of scale would mean Tesla would make a nice profit instantly by installing them. There are a few big IF\u2019s, but I like the numbers."

If IV collapses to 30% and price stays then you\u2019re down half. \n\n\nOptimally you\u2019d want to see TSLA shoot to $160 tmrw. \n\n\nGive it like 1-2hr into open if you want to gamble which I assume you do. If you don\u2019t, try to set a sell order for your cost first thing and hope you get lucky."

Applied to current preopen spot level of 154, those calls should open at around 5.70 generating a nice 24% profit for OP if he is not stupid enough to hold on to those options whose value will decay quite fast.\nGiven OP probably had no idea either what he was doing , congrats and FU.\nSource : trust me bro, this is my job"

He had about 50k he won after a car accident, and invested heavily in Tesla when it was on its way up to its high. He was always in trouble with management for spending all day on his phone and talking about stocks with people who were just irritated by it.\n\nI really wonder how he's doing now. I know the kid was sweet, but not super bright. And he certainly didn't come from money. His mom was a single mom and he lived with her and a roommate.

My account is now at ~$100k [proof](https://ibb.co/GHBwy7b) with the majority of it coming in the past month. I withdrew $23k around the time my account got to $30k from some TSLA puts (when it dropped from $220 to $200 in one day). The majority of my gains this month are from NVDA. I bought 15 12/30 177.5 puts when it was around 178 and sold for a 10k gain when it dropped to 154. Then I bought 30 1/6 NVDA 165 puts and sold for $48k gain when it dropped to $142 yesterday. My only position now is what you see in the screenshot.\n\nEdit: Here are my first trades in September that got me off to a good start https://ibb.co/09hP0rz"

Depending on your overall income for this year, that income plus your trading profits, may put you in one of the higher tax brackets.

Next day it started climbing and climbing and climbing, had I held 3 more days I would be double my account, this year has sucked went from 57k to 2k thanks to market crash l. hate you people posting 100k returns, I was trying to make 100k to build a home for my family, dont look like that's happening now. Ultimately my fault but still I had planned to get back in to recoup after price dropped more, WSB stopped it from dropping screwed my plan. No more house for us :( rant over congrats winners sorry to the ones who lost big, force to sell or go bankrupt hurts."

I will not be surprised if they cancel Q&A altogether.\\n\\nEDIT: This ER was a fizzle not fireworks, and the puts might be fucked. Thanks for all the comments - will post an update on Friday or when I close them, whichever comes first.\\n\\n**UPDATE 1/26/23: Thanks for the comments, good wishes, and ill wishes, my fellow regards. As I said in the early comments, I am OK if I lose 100% of the position since it is a small portion of my experimental Webull account. I do not condone \"yoloing\" a significant amount of money on short term trades with FDs, especially ER plays. Also, fuck Elon Kanye West Musk.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aftu293pv8ea1.png?width=348&format=png&au'",

     "I was going to buy PUTs; however, analysts had been revising their estimates for Q4 over the past week to make it easier for Tesla to \"hit\".  \n\nEven with help by the \"consensus\", they still barely got there \\*and\\* there were some questionable details in the reports.  \n\n\nFirst of all, WHERE did that $4B in cash go?  Magically there is a 4.3B bite out of cash labeled as \"investments\".  I sure as shit hope Elon didn't send money to bail out Twitter.  If that happened holy hell.  I only theorize that because I don't think there was any mention of this investment in the call.   \n\n\nSecond, the #'s showed that margin took a pretty good hit even though sales only really started in Dec.  Imagine what is going to happen in '23?  Couple that with the comments about costs going up and ....\n\nThird, very curious how they added a lot of employees but expenses dropped.  (e.g. SG&A)  \n\nFour, they recognized \\~350M of FSD revenue to help them meet #'s.  Adoption rate for FSD is very low these days and this isn't something they will be able to keep doing.    \n\n\nWith all that said, I hope this thing runs back to 300 so we can get some real short action into '23.  Not sure they have many levers left to pull."

     "$TSLA is a buy at $80\n\nIt will hit $80 in April as tech stocks correct\n\nWhy?\n\n1. The OPEC decision to drop production will increase inflationary pressures and force the federal reserve to raise interest rates higher than anticipated \n\n2. The liquidity crisis at the banks has just begun. This will result in tightening of credit standards\n\n3. Tesla is a premium brand and as the Covid relief vapors dissipate, the pressure increases.\n\n4. There are some extraordinary luxury EVs flowing into the marketplace with Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Maserati, Lamborghini, Ferrari, Bentley and Rolls-Royce \n\n5. Elon Musk is alienating many potential EV buyers who dislike his political views and Twitter tirades. He is Tesla and Tesla is he (for better or worse)\n\nAll that said, when it hits $80 I will buy a bunch because of the strong command he has over his zealots. People will buy the Cybertruck and people will continue to worship Elon as a genius. I\u2019m happy to ride that up although I will likely load up on $VCR vanguard consumer discretionary since it has 12% exposure to Tesla"

     "Question he has 154 contract and cost him .90 cent so in total it cost him 142 dollars and it expire on the 6 of april and he needs these contracts to go to 411 on spy to break even right and he was fine at first but now spy is at 409 so my question is \n\n1. When you have a contract and it hits it goal which was 411 can you collect those gain early or do you by force how to wait at the end of your contract to collect your possible gain or nothing if it doesnt hit its target\n\n2.how much would math guy gain with those 154 contract if it al hit its target of 411?\n\n3. What happens if somehow spy goes over 411 and let's say goes 416 by the 6 of april would he gain more money\n\n4. What video helps explain how to order a contract in Robinhood and pull out \n\n5. Does robinhood have contract for 300 for tesla for April 28 kinda want to risk it and see if I become somewhat rich or stay broke got 5k willing to lose and this math guy seems interesting in his calls that ik willing to lose that 5k\n\n6. Can you have multiple contact for different days on 1 stock"

It also requires special welding techniques.\n\n\n>Tesla has shared virtually no details about how it will overcome the challenges of working with stainless steel, which include safety. The steel used in most cars is designed to crumple in a crash, absorbing energy and protecting passengers. Stainless steel does not crumple as easily, exposing passengers to more of the force from impact.\ufeff"

The price of the stock is determined by how much people are willing to pay for that piece of paper. If more people want to buy the stock, then the price goes up. It's as simple as supply and demand.\n\nThere are two main types of stocks: common stocks and preferred stocks. Common stocks are what most people think of when they think ofstocks - they give you a vote at shareholders' meetings and entitle you to a portionof the profits (if any) generated by the company through dividends or share buybacks\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)"

In particular, the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas tends to be a peak time for moviegoing, as families and friends look for ways to spend time together and escape the cold weather.  \n\n\nAMC, one of the largest movie theater chains in the United States, has typically seen increased foot traffic during the holiday season. The company has reported that December is typically one of its busiest months of the year, with many customers coming to see new releases, as well as classic holiday films that are often re-released in theaters.  \n\n\nExpecting strong earnings report tomorrow."

Tesla\u2019s cars really are the best, but the number of people who are freaking out about Musk\u2019s actions on Twitter in a particular dramatic and reductionist manner and in turn saying they\u2019ll punish Tesla for it is large. I\u2019m not sure what to think. On the one hand, a car is a large purchase, and Tesla makes the best EVs no question. On the other, some of the original cadre of Tesla buyers were purchasing on an environment basis and as a political statement alongside the cars quality.  I don\u2019t know if this will be material. It certainly hasn\u2019t flipped their reputation in red states where you can get definitely get made fun of for having a Tesla.\n\nI think marginal stock pricing may be getting pushed a bit on the same dynamics. Owning Tesla stock as esg surely is related to owning a Tesla as esg\u2026\n\nOr maybe this is just car loans being so expensive and they are past most of the people who pay with cash\u2026"

On the very day of expiration my option opened in the money for the first time ever.  Not only that but the stock was something like $3 over.  So I went from near complete loss to huge gains in just one day.  Then I fell asleep.\n\nI woke up to find the price had dropped back below by literally cents.  My options were now about to become worthless.  And being an idiot I didn't think to maybe exercise them (I think this would be tax advantageous) or sell.  Expired worthless at exactly the strike price.  A few days later the stock was up something like 50% more."

And they really never elaborated what purpose the robot even serves other than it watering a plant in a video it seems like a god awful waste of resources and man hours.    Would much rather get an updated Cybertruck design and a firm release date that they actually stick to.   But I guess when your company trades at a 500 P/E ratio you need to do futuristic hype projects like this and not actually produce shit people want"

It's valued as a tech company over a car company, car companies that are 10x the scale have cheaper market caps and are valued not as highly as Tesla. Sales for Tesla's are going down as more and better car companies are getting into the EV field. Tesla is almost entirely extrinsically valued, it could crash to it's actual price at any moment. We're seeing tech companies in the stock market fall constantly because of the extrinsical value they hold.

     "Your graph does show what you intended, that insiders are selling a lot and buying very little.\n\nHowever, it also shows that insiders are not magic, and they aren't exempt from missing something or making mistakes.\n\nLook at the last insider purchase. Now watch as insiders sell all the way from 75 to the very top. If they were magical market makers, they wouldn't have sold at 100, 150, 250, 350, etc. They would have held right until about 425 and then dumped and made a killing. But they don't know when things stop going up, just as they don't know when things stop going down.\n\nThey aren't buying at these levels despite a huge dump. Should they be? Time will tell. Maybe Tesla reverses from here, makes some announcements, Twitter gets a new CEO, rates stall, earnings are incredible, and Tesla rises from here to 1,000 over the next few years. We would be able to look back on this graph and think \"these idiot insiders didn't buy at all! What do they know?\"\n\nSo time will tell. Insiders look dumb in retrospect for selling shares at 75 when things ultimately went above 400. Will they look equally dumb for not buying as much as they can get their hands on at these levels?"

What are the other holdings? Are they options that are owned by banks?\\n\\nI think this is a really cool concept that allows options play without options risk.

It's not just Elon Musk's company nor is he the one making the actual cars, he's just the main investor. Tesla employs alot of people in the U.S, and is currently spearheading the initiative to make trucks lithium powered. \n\nDon't ever lose your position unless you're absolutely sure a company is going bankrupt. And even then, bunkruptcy isn't always the end: if the government announces a bail out, that means they have faith ib or a desire to keep that company open. \n\nWasteland Management for example went bankrupt in the 90's due to Mafia corruption. Now it's one of the most reliable garbage stocks you can hold. \n\nSometimes, unpopular companies such as PG&E of California are propped up due to necessity- despite being wrongfully blamed for a wildfire that some resident started with his propane tank, PG&E is the only company established enough to handle electricity for all of southern California's wildfire prone areas. - it's not their fault that global warming is causing drier seasonsand excessive heat waves. That's why PG&E is still alive and well despite the 2018 backlash."

I shall fullfill my duty and buy the options that most are either too smart to touch or too dumb to understand the underlying 99.9% probability of pure worthlessness of the contracts.

Now every automaker on planet earth is rushing into the EV space, potentially crowding out QC challenged Tesla. Now other automakers from Lucid to GM to the Korean Megacorp are blowing Tesla's technology into the weeds. Meanwhile, Musk's wildly oscillating political stances potentially are alienating everyone.\n\nSo short Tesla? Hell no. Who knows what Musk comes up with next?

As the other carmakers sell EVs that revenue stream will also dry up (if it hasn\u2019t already, I\u2019m not sure of the current situation). This means Tesla bringing in something like $15-20K less revenue per vehicle sold. Which is\u2026 a lot. And prices are even lower in China where a ton of future sales are expected to be. This means that even if Tesla can meet the crazy predictions for unit sales growth, it won\u2019t translate into nearly as much earnings growth.

Around late 2007 or early 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately 31% of Exxon Mobil's (highest market cap in the world - at that time). Apple's market cap has grown by an estimated 1,500% since 2007.

Tesla is a rapidly evolving company, and if you want to make informed investment decisions, you need to keep up with the latest news and updates.\n\nSo, here's my advice to you, wise guy: Instead of relying on outdated data, do your homework and stay up to date.

EV already have low maintenance and the only expensive thing on people mind is the battery pack after all.\n\nThey claimed to have ramp and made 800K cells in a period of 7 days recently (if true that\u2019s a huge milestone consider they just hit a million and 10 million cells lately). IMO, I think Tesla is currently focus on volume production for battery before implementing new battery formula (their battery is still the old graphite \u2018anode\u2019 and NMC \u2018cathode\u2019 chemically based on the recent battery tear down not the new promised silicon based anode and iron based cathode on battery day presentation)\n\nOther EV makers so call \u201cTesla killer\u201d will have to make super dirt cheap EV to offset the need to battery replacement every 8-10 years period since no one include \u201cBiden\u2019s union favorite\u201d don\u2019t have battery production planning in place at all. Alternatively they might have to swallow their pride and conform into Tesla battery structure design in order to use Tesla battery moving forward. Might as well using Tesla charging plug as well.\n\nI might entice in throwing in some chum change on some call options a couple days before their earning call for giggle."

     "A number of things Aside from the Twitter debacle.\n\n First is the Tesla owner community is pissed on the design of the early models, AC units. It's above the battery, so it dumps water on the battery pack. It eventually corrodes through the steel and destroys the battery. The cost of repair is an average of $28k. There are a few boycotts going around in the Tesla community.\n\nThe second part is the Ford Lightning. Being available to be a test bed for future EVs. One of the tests was towing. It takes EVs  300%-500% the amount of charge to tow 2000lbs-4000lbs. Efficiency goes out the window. This has led people to speculate the reason Cybertruck and Tesla Truck delays. \n\nThe third part is competition. Specifically Hyundai is expected to be the new Champion of EVs. Their EV Ionic line is out pacing Tesla in sales. Others are betting on the Hyundai Hydrogen Hybrid System, they announced with the Concept Vision 74. Adding to the new interest in Rotary Hydrogen Engines being developed. There have been 2-3 different ones, so far \n\nAnd Last, it's the Ukraine war. Ukraine is a major electric hardness manufacturer. That's shut down. They are also the second richest European countries in terms of Lithium. It has caused the Lithium price to go up 220% and it's only going up."

It has grown vehicles revenue and deliveries at a 40%+ clip with guidance to continue to do so. Emissions credits becoming an increasingly small percentage of that revenue (286M Q3).\r  \n\r  \nIt operates with net profit margins (14.9% TTM) unrivaled by top large scale automakers. Despite low total volume, it still pulled in more profit (3.3B) than Toyota (3.1B) in the last quarter (a company traditionally seen at the top of vehicle manufacturing efficiency).\r  \n\r  \nIt does this while spinning up two new factories in Austin and Berlin and scaling up factories in Fremont and Shanghai. It has solidified necessary materials for battery cell and pack manufacturing, which many see as the limiting factor in EV growth. It is not saddled by legacy business that will have to be spun down and shows way more financial competency than small pure EV competitors like Rivian and Lucid.\r  \n\r  \nDespite competition coming, TAM is massive (some projections at 1T by 2030), there's room for Tesla to lose considerable market share while maintaining growth rate. GM and Ford are targeting low single digit margins for their EVs, by their own admission, allowing TSLA to use it's pricing power in times of low demand (i.e. covid, recession).\r  \n\r\r  \n\rAll this at the cusp of the largest EV/Solar tax incentives in US history."

I have listened to there bs over the years and for some apparent reason they use scare tactics to manipulate the stock price always in favor for the big institutional investors. lets take tesla right now, there excuse is Musk bought Twitter, so he didnt shut down tesla, they are on track this quarter for historic deliveries, got deal done with south korea, cybertruck coming out, so in essence thereis no reason for tesla to be down except for manipulation practices by investment banks. Bottomline is Musk could be sitting in his tesla office everyday they would come up with something else"

Those are usually the two legged dollar menu of a human that you will find talking about what junk Teslas are and how elon fans are so dumb that the only reason they can mark them up so high is because people will buy at any price from him.\n\nThen on the other side, you'll find the group of individuals that are capable of both breathing, using only thier nose and reading without moving thier mouth. \nAll this while either knowing something about the company and being able to speak on it or not knowing and not caring to, and so, not sharing an uninformed, ignorent opinion.  \n\nAlso, just as a side note as I wrap up. If you think Tesla is just an eletric car company, and your on here telling people \"you've done the research\". Look around for the nearest moving vehicle and stand in front of it. \ud83d\ude18"

The only thing holding TSLA back is that Elon has apparently gone insane.\\n\\nTesla is still the strongest EV maker by far. They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can't make enough EVs to matter.\\n\\n(See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won't let me post the links. )\\n\\nWhat really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn't that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles. By the end of 2023, it will be even higher. A company doing a 35% to 40% YoY growth rate is not at all high to have a 57 PE ratio.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Edit: Her\"",

Automotive gross margin of Tesla is on a decline after a year where they had the highest prices before they had to cut prices at the end of 22 and beginning of this year. \\n\\n\\nWith lower prices, their margin is going to drop even more.

     "The \"Tesla is an auto manufacturer\" point doesn't really stick for me. Tesla makes autos, so sure... the statement is true. It does sell the scope of Tesla's innovations short though. It remains to be seen in terms of whether or not Tesla's innovations are over-valued in my highly regarded opinion.\n\nI think it's become easy to complain about any perceived deficiency in Tesla performance when other auto manufacturers do not have a direct comparison that can also be scrutinized at the same level. I do also believe that a fair share of that scrutiny is put on Tesla solely based on whether or not the person likes or dislikes Elon.\n\nOf course, maybe other makers will surpass Tesla at doing Tesla things... but that day isn't today. I don't see how Tesla can be written off into the eternal put abyss. For me, it's a hold right now, as I'm happy with the position that I have. Otherwise, I'd at least consider buying."

(TLDR at bottom for the illiterate/lazy)\n\nPositions: \n0 DTE TSLA Puts on last Friday at strike prices of $217.50p and $207.50p. 2k turned to 75k Friday afternoon \n\nThis morning I decided to be semi-responsible and withdrew $40,000 and then proceeded to hammer 0DTE Spy $378c a bit too early at 10:30am. Doubled down at 11:40am, saw I was -9k about 20 minutes later as SPY broke below $376 so tripled down for a total of 390 contracts. About an hour later SPY rocketed and sold all contracts for a $35,000 profit. \n\nUnfortunately bought SAVA weeklies at the top and holding strong on DWAC. \n\nAnything is possible fellow gamblers. Godspeed\n\nTLDR: Bought 0DTE TSLA $217.50p and $207.5p last Friday when trading at $222 and sold at $203 Friday afternoon for 75k profit.\n\nBought 390 SPY $378c today and sold for 35k profit\n\nHolding LYFT Puts/Calls, DWAC calls, and SAVA calls.

I understand that this is not an end all be all analysis, and that there are other ways to evaluate the question that might produce a different answer, but I dont have the time, resources or skills to do a full analytical study  Ill leave that up to the big institutions who have billions riding on it.\\n\\nI looked at only 4 key metrics and compared them to other companies in either the automotive sector or the tech sector and only based on their most recent quarterlies, so there are some timing discrepancies, but they shouldnt matter a great deal since Im not looking at day to day, week to week moves. I understand there are many other factors to consider, but Im a regard and kind'",

     "The way I\u2019ve always looked at it is like this. You compare Ford and GM because they are the same. They have similar margins, similar debt, similar mission, and so on. Then there is tesla, they are an outlier in all cases. They make more money, have less debt, and operate differently. \n\nI also think they are a car company, because most of their revenue comes from car sales. But it doesn\u2019t make sense to compare it to legacy, because they are different in almost every way other than they all sell cars. \n\nTesla also sells energy storage, which has been ramping extremely fast. And sees no signs of slowing down through the recession, unlike car sales. \n\nTesla also has advantages in this upcoming price war, while legacy is fighting to become profitable Tesla will be able to set (relatively) whatever price they want and still make money. More than legacy does on their ice sales.. \n\nSo in the near term, Teslas valuation may due for some downward pressure if prices need to keep dropping. But longterm there\u2019s a maturing EV business and a high growth higher margin energy business ramping. And there\u2019s a slim chance legacy performs better than tesla over then next few years, higher chance that legacy slips more and tesla picks up the slack."

  "Text": "b\"Two years ago, it was pretty clear that Tesla was overvalued. Its P/E ratio was significantly higher than its competitors. In fact, the company was worth more than General Motors, Ford, and Toyota combined. Tesla seemed poised to eventually compete with the established automakers but investors seemed to think that Tesla would eventually become a monopoly. Tesla did better than expected in 2020 but it seemed like investors overshot the new reality. And it seems like I was right to be fearful when investors were greedy on TSLA.\\n\\nFrom two years ago, the stock has gone down by 58.27%. The P/E ratio is now 37.78. The thing to note about Tesla is that it's really a tech stock and it should be treated as such. Tech stocks tend to have higher P/E ratios because investors anticipate higher revenue growth. Another thing worth noting is that while the stock price has fallen, earnings have gone up. In 2020, Tesla made roughly $31.5 billion with $6.6 billion in gross profit and just under $2 billio\"",

     "Tesla lost its edge.  It never would have succeeded without Elon Musk. But Elon doesn\u2019t understand the average car buyer. Most people aren\u2019t comfortable buying their cars by texting and ordering site unseen. Full disclosure I have two 2018 Teslas a model X in a Model S with both of them having about 50,000 miles on them. They are great cars but I just rented a brand new Toyota Avalon in San Diego last weekend and the self driving experience was superior. Not a herky-jerky slamming on the brakes and tearing off into different lands experience. Elon needs to stop playing with his social media purchase and get new product into the marketplace. There are lots of fun EV alternatives coming out of the market. I know and 80-year-old man who put a deposit down on the pick up truck when it first came out. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll still be around by the time they get the pick up truck to market. To me it\u2019s looking just like another example of someone that gets super successful and thinks it\u2019s because they were a genius and no one else can measure up to them. Big mistake."

     "Lol what. You realize precovid tsla only hit the lvl it's currently trading at 1x then promptly plummeted 30%. I'm so sick of this its a tech company argument. Really? OK then let's look at it as a tech company. It's main product would be fsd which has been in beta for its whole existence, has lost multiple lawsuits around the world and can't even be advertised as fsd in places in Europe due to it not being a working product. Every new product post last car variants that came out precovid, have been delayed and not released or canceled. So rn as a tech company it hasn't even delivered a complete product. Lastly, the burn rate on these factories is no joke and the fact the Chinese have begun snubbing tsla for Home grown EVs(byd,Xi, etc) means there's less demand from one of its main buyers. So now you have a situation where you have excess factory capacity because you just spent shit tons of money to build factories without appropriate demand to back up the increased production. Tsla is a fucking car company and do you really think more tsla buyers just gonna keep popping up giving them exponential yoy customer base growth rate? How? Why would someone buy a tesla now when something from Honda costs much less, or stuff from China cost less and have 20+ year warranties and way nicer/less sparse interiors and additional accessories. It blows my fucking mind that ppl really think tesla is worth the value it's currently trading at and even moreso that ppl think it should be trading at 2x+ its current value. You are a fool if you believe this or just a elon Stan. No metrics have supported even current price levels for the last 2 years. The fed created this with their bazooka money cannons and interest free money Era is fucking over."

     "TL.DR Elon messed up his brand to those most likely to be buyers right now, and in the past. Tesla can't rely on his remaining fans to fill the gap for in the short term. Legacy companies will get stuff figured out and build better cars. Tesla will be an also ran many years from now.\n\nBrand\nYou guys need to understand brand. Damage the brand and it can take a long time to recover, if it can. He done went and messed the brand. \nFor right now, not in 5 years or 10, but right now, what kind of person has bought an EV. Up to now I suppose the EV market has been made up of those who think they are helping the environment, some status symbol buyers, and some are Elon cultists. Elon has made his best effort to alienate many of the enviro crowd, who tend to swing left. So if you alienate those, you also alienate a good portion of the status symbol buyers, bc the damage done to the brand takes away the status part of the status symbol. Brand.\nSo we are left with your remaining Elon cultists and right wingers who want to own the libs. But most of the people I know here in Tennessee who want to own the libs think climate change is a hoax. Most of the time I go to the local Walmarts where there are charges, there are usually ICE pickup trucks parked in the spots, every time. \nAnd until the Twitter purchase, Elon had the quirky genius that left leaning types love. Right wingers don't like Elon because of his cars. They like that he has owned the libs so hard since he bought Twitter.\nBut back to the cars. Never been in a Tesla, but I here so much about the poor quality. The legacy companies will get the EV thing figured out, and will build better cars. Why? Because they build cars. Nothing else."

Lots of competition it didn\u2019t have 2 years ago, higher interest loans, huge amounts of defaults on loans (people can\u2019t pay off their cars), and many people dumping their Tesla\u2019s in the used market. Also, the Elon fan boy train died down after people realized he\u2019s not the genius everyone thought he was by buying Twitter which turned out to be the worse business move in his career. He\u2019s also alienated a lot of people by getting political and becoming a conservative. Tesla as a company isn\u2019t doing much either. Their tech is no longer \u201ccutting edge\u201d, no new features, delay in the self driving mode for 3+ years, delay in the cybertruck and roadster for 3+ years. Also, no more crazy waitlists. Also, people are complaining about the poor QC. As funny as it sounds, Tesla can\u2019t keep up with the competition anymore the way they used to in 2018 - 2021. No, in my opinion the stock still has a way to go down and there isn\u2019t really anything positive that will drive the stock up. I\u2019d keep it on my watch list until Q2 - Q3 of this year."

It\u2019s an electric car company who\u2019s CEO has just spent 44 billion dollars on the most effective anti-advertising campaign in human history. Tesla went from being the default choice, to being the last choice in a sector they are quickly getting overtaken by the majors. There are drastically more choices now, and they won\u2019t call you a libtard for being vaccinated.\n\n\n3. It\u2019s a car company that has been building the same limited number of models for almost a decade and they\u2019re still not cheap\u2026 the ENTIRE premise of them not releasing new models was to keep manufacturing costs down and let the economy of scale reduce prices. Their current cheapest option is 45k\u2026. \n\n\n\nIf the economy turns back around, this will probably have been a good time to buy, but there\u2019s ZERO question in my mind that the company is DRASTICALLY over valued and begging to be more than halved again."

     "Here's what ChatGPT says about what you regards are talking about today. Here are some of the common phrases and topics that I found in the thread you provided:\n\nBinance and Europe: There seems to be some issues between the Binance platform and Europe. It's mentioned that France has launched a money laundering investigation against Binance, and the platform seems to have left the Netherlands\u200b1\u200b.\n\nMicrosoft or Nvidia: A user is considering whether to place out-of-the-money (OTM) calls on Microsoft or Nvidia, suggesting these are popular stock options among the community\u200b1\u200b.\n\nBiden and red days: There's a comment about President Biden declaring an end to \"red days\" (days when the stock market goes down)\u200b1\u200b.\n\nSpotify: A user predicts a downturn for Spotify because the service is not working on their computer. This comment seems more humorous than serious, but it does show how personal experiences can influence trading decisions in this community\u200b1\u200b.\n\nMarket trend: A user has commented on the market going up by 10% in one day and people experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)\u200b1\u200b.\n\nSQQQ: There's a discussion about the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF (SQQQ), with one user considering buying and holding it, despite others apparently having been \"burned\" by it in the past\u200b1\u200b.\n\nFederal Reserve (\"Fed\"): There's a comment about the Federal Reserve possibly bluffing about hikes being over, with a prediction that the market will go up significantly\u200b1\u200b.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR): A quote from Alex Karp, the CEO of Palantir Technologies, is mentioned. The quote refers to an increase in interest in the company\u200b1\u200b.\n\nThe common phrases and topics in this thread seem to revolve around specific stocks (Microsoft, Nvidia, Spotify, Palantir), ETFs (SQQQ), trading strategies (OTM calls, buy and hold), and current events affecting the market (Binance's situation, Federal Reserve's actions, market trends)."

Even if they meet target, that would still be up 43% or so from 2021. Growth and demand is expected to slow in 2023,  without a doubt, but I believe the $7500 discount was to drive some sales before year-end in anticipation of the $7500 EV tax credit available next year, rather than a severe plunge in demand.\\n\\nDuring the Q3 earnings call, Musk expects an epic and record-breaking Q4. Is this as believable as Musk not selling any more shares \\n\\nI am not good at reading tea-leaves and drawing magical lines like many others. But it seems there could be a massive run up or draw down in the coming weeks, even if it is short-term.\\n\\nCalls or puts?\"",

Seems sus. Very soon after the stock started dropping in the pre market, which later the article was debunked by Tesla and reported again by Reuters. \\n\\nAnother possibility is Elon selling, which just happened to seem like a sell off on the bad news which I find possible because 6% drop on news that was later debunked seems like a lot. \\n\\nEither way, huge overreaction from the market today (unless is was Musk). China is apparently cutting back on restrictions, so hopefully there are no future surprises in Shanghai production. \\n\\nNow I see Cramer '",

They require a lot of up front analysis and active management of the trade. Also, my experience has been that the first move can be a fake out, so you can easily wind up selling the side that will actually be profitable and eventually lose on both. \n\nYou can always paper trade the strategy to see how it goes and get a feel for the challenges and potential rewards. Good luck!\n\nUPDATE: For disclosure, I hold a very small (0.22% of portfolio) 2/17/23 vertical short on TSLA.  I took the position based on my Bollinger Band strategy and nothing to do with the upcoming earnings."

(time value or true value as i call it)\n\nI went with a 3970 call\n\n3875 put.\n\ncost $34 total. Small bet.\n\nthe call alone went to 90 (roughly 500 us dollars).\n\nthe put nearly buried, was so over ruled.. and paid for...it is safe to leave for the other half of the gamble until  expiry.\n\nthat is a successful strangle.. you can get hung real bad with volatility, being too far out..or not enough movement leaving you in decay. That is just playing for fun then.\n\nto determine a need for strangle.. the call and put volume should both be large, the graph in a noted high or low... this nearly gaurantees a big pop one way or the other...you can also lopside the strangle to favor put or call. Up to you and your DD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get too emotional at Tesla.. I'd be all puts even as it climbed to the fake moon.\n\nHave fun with it."

If youve seen the current rally, youll understand how quick it is for $TSLA to go from $100 to $135 within a short period. This is just the beginning \\n\\n2. Earnings are coming up and $TSLA demand is skyrocketing lately. This means earnings will do incredible and the price action you just saw recently will be multiplied (think 150)\\n\\n3. Elon Musk is slowly gaining back the trust of institutions and people, and is getting ready to have Twitter appointed a new CEO which will let him be focused entirely on Tesla, this means the stock has bottomed and will probably be rebounding HARD  back to 180-200+ in the next month\\n\\nGet ready for blast off '",

He sold Tesla stock repeatedly prior to bad news coming out lol I just read a WSJ article stating that out in print lol Tesla is a car company that has no leader and the decisions are being phoned in from Twitter's headquarters where BTW Elon is trying to do the same thing he did with all of his companies......figure out a way to make money from it lol SHORT Tesla to the gates of hell....just my braindead opinion"

     "I studied the stock market in college. My professor told me that if you want to make real money then you have to critically think about every option. He said that your brain is the most valuable tool. The stock market is kinda like a metronome. It swings back and forth on its appraisals of things. A true companies worth comes from their innovation and not the \u201cnews\u201d. Remember guys the stock market really is something to admire sometimes (These charts, options, cool colors). We really shouldn\u2019t take it for granted. Life is a one time thing. Walk up to that girl and just kiss her, spend your last $20 on a lunch with your father even tho he beat you when you were younger, tell your cousin you went thru her phone and saw all her nudes. Live for the moment. \n\nGoodluck tomorrow guys. I love y\u2019all."

     "I've been thinking about this stock way too much so really appreciate you putting this out there. Based on a few other DCFs I've seen from unbiased analysts, this makes sense. They had $130 but that was before the consensus growth dropped.\n\n> Note: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is...\n\nThis is the most important assumption. I think with the recent price drops, we should expect this growth to go down more, but no one knows by how much.\n\nI believe 24.4% is too high but if they execute perfectly, they can achieve it. But it's really difficult and few companies are capable of pulling it off.\n\n> Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.\n\nI think this strength is mostly gone. Their product roadmap includes the Model 2, Cybertruck, Semi, and full FSD. These have been on the radar for awhile and there are other companies beating them to the punch in each of these markets. BYD is beating them in battery tech as well. Looking at their R&D spend compared to other companies, this isn't a surprise.\n\n> Manufacturing Complications\n\nI actually think manufacturing is a strength. They've shown to be incredibly nimble during the chip shortage. They also managed to keep costs under control. Compared to other companies who historically ramp up to 1M units, they did well. The QA is questionable but I don't know how bad it is. They're definitely not Toyota, but maybe still better than say VW.\n\n> Product Liability Claims\n\nThis is the greatest present threat to Tesla. It's why Musk started censoring the guy that put the 8 car crash video online. There's a lot more complaints and evidence collected by national agencies. NHTSA is going after their FSD Beta for public endangerment and it's going to get heated.\n\n> Market Confidence in Tesla\n\nParticularly, among retail investors, this stock is so strong, even with Musk proving to be a tool. The growth story is arguably over for now, but the Tesla cult premium puts them over the edge.\n\nI think your $85 fair value is right on and it would be around here if it was any other stock. The cult premium pretty significant."

     "I'm not reading all that. Not sure what most of it is.\n\nMy price target was under 100 by next Fall. I made it a bit over a month ago before Tesla dropped 50%.\n\nNow my price target is less than 50$.\n\nWhy? Let me count the ways.\n\n1. Russo-Ukraine War. Two thirds of worlds pig iron produced in Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine production is in ruins or without power (Zaporozhye Nuclear Plant ring a bell?)\n\n2. The full Tesla thesis will require a 10x increase in Lithium production in 10 years and a doubling or more of nickel, chromium, molybdemun, and other minerals as well. Throughought human history no nation or society has been able to double production of a mainline commodity in 10 years. Now that Russia is out there is no way future production goals can be met. Add in inflation and high interest rates and it complicates this further.\n\n3. China is a wreck. Millions of new Covid cases a day. People refusing to pay mortgages because real estate developers stole their money. Riots. And Xi sitting on top of it all without any competent lieutenants because he purged everyone that might challenge him. China will be lucky to be a single country by the end of the decade. GigaChina is probably going to be a total write off. Oh, did I mention that China's population actually peaked a decade ago and there are about 100 million more males than females. Population bust means that China won't even have high consumption. Both Apple and Tesla should have left two years ago.\n\n4. GigaBerlin has some of the most expensive energy in the Western Hemisphere. It's going to cut into Tesla's margins and maybe make then unprofitable. Europe IS in recession (China too) and that means lower consumption. BASF moved its entire operations to Louisiana because without natural gas they cannot compete.\n\n5. Musk bought Twitter and pissed off all the Libs who are Tesla's best customers. They'll be more receptive to the truth. Tesla's cars are not green. They require a lot of expensive materials that are all produced in high polluting and carbon intensive industries. It takes a decade or more to break even on the carbon debt of producing a Tesla. Plus, Tesla's are a luxury car. They are usually people's third vehicle. In the coming recession luxury purchases always fall.\n\nFor these reasons and the shitty economic outlook it think 50$ is generous. I think its ACTUAL value is probably less than Ford. But people bought a dream that would save the climate. They won't believe it's not true for a long time. They won't want to."

The above is all rear view perspective. What Tesla has in the planning will I imagine blow many peoples minds. It's a bit of a leap of faith owning the stock to be honest. Also there are fewer companies on the worldwide stock exchanges than in the 90s. So fewer investment opportunities. A 'green' company such as Tesla will want to be on most portfolio managers holdings when they have their 1 to 1s with bosses, the pressure to invest green is really significant. So from USA, Germany, UK, France, Korea, Japan and Australia etc. people from around the world will want a share of few of Tesla. So that buying power in a smaller pool should give support. Plus no profit sharing dealers."

While you might say 3-5% can be had risk free from a treasury, that 3-5% could be realized much quicker if TSLA stabilizes or bounces. If TSLA gets a nice bounce, you could probably take 2-3% very quickly and close the position. If TSLA stops dropping, the premium could also quickly evaporate.  \\n\\nLook at it this way: You're either buying a stock you love at a price that would be like 99% lower than what you've been paying the last 24 months while you had a hard-on for it, or you just pull a few percent in premiums a lot sooner than 12 months.\"",

     ">I completely agree with your assessment of the situation. Tesla is a great company that has been severely overvalued by the market for quite some time now. However, their cash position and recent profitability give them a strong floor under their share price, even in the event of an economic recession.\n\nSelling puts on Tesla shares is a great way to make quick profits while waiting for the stock price to stabilize or rebound. You can get 3-5% premiums on these puts, which is much better than what you would get from investing in treasury bonds. Plus, if Tesla does bounce back quickly, you could take 2-3% profits very quickly and close out your position."

Should I consider $185 puts 30 days out and $230 calls 30 days out? I think about 50 contracts for each? My logic is earnings TSLA gets a 10-12% spike then musk sells shares for Twitter purchase and price falls back down to $200 and below. Thoughts?"

     "Good post OP, but I can quickly summarize the anti catalysts of Tesla.\n\nBasically all their profits come from Tesla Shanghai. Unfortunately, that money is trapped in China. The factory the Chinese built for Tesla came with some draconian terms. They have to pay ever increasing tax revenue per sqft, which means eventually they won't have the efficiency gains to comply. Expanding the factory also doesn't help them with this metric. They also have to invest ever increasing sums of money into the factory, meaning the profits from the factory are earmarked to expand the factory. If they fail these conditions, China is able to seize the factory and their IP.\n\nGoing along with the above, the head of Tesla China, Tom Zhu, is effectively CEO of all of Tesla now in all but title. It s a clear powermove by china where they're the alpha in the relationship with all the leverage. China can tell Tesla whatever to do and effectively has a controlling interest in Tesla, even though they don't legally have one, just because the destructive risk to Tesla of losing their best factory is too much for the company to survive. They are part of China Inc now, and if they don't like it, China will exercise the terms of the contract Tesla signed and make 2/3rds of Tesla part of China inc.\n\nTesla used Enron style mark to market accounting, which was approved under the Trump admin in 2018 and Tesla immediately switched to it in Q1 2018, restating earnings under this accounting change . It increased revenue by $299M in that quarter and profits significantly, allowing Tesla to continually report profits. This accounting scheme allows revenue to be pulled forward and led to the stratospheric valuations of the dotcom bubble. It also cuts both ways, it accelerates growth and falling, meaning Tesla has had a rosier (and not as profitable) economic picture because of this accounting change, and likely would not have made it into the s&p500 without it. Tesla also pays suppliers on a delta, so revenue is prebooked and costs of production are deferred.\n\nThe above accounting scheme really benefits a backlog of orders like Tesla has historically had. It also allowed them to play games with Hertz and Carvana inflating orders by placing large non binding orders.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla has prebooked carbon credit sales that haven't occured yet. They cook the books in a lot of ways.\n\nPost 2018, Tesla rapidly went through CFOs that resigned probably because they weren't comfortable with how much Elon wanted them to cook the books. Eventually Elon promoted a young 30ish year old millennial, Zach Kirkhorn to CFO, a position he was absolutely not qualified for. He changed his job title to Master of Coin and bought Bitcoin for Tesla, so he's either an idiot or the Bitcoin was Tesla's attempt to get their stuck money out of China, or possibly both.\n\nFSD is Theranos level fraud. The paint it black video was faked, and the employees involved at the time have turned whistleblowers to the media. Tesla isn't transparent with data, but crowd sourced data as well as YouTubers show fsd needs at least a 10000x improvement to match the average driver, if it were to actually drive with no driver baby sitting it. \n\nTesla has one of the highest defect rates of any car manufacturer and highest repair costs on average, but keeps the lowest warranty reserves. The profit margin they have is thus somewhat faked because the long tail of warranty issues isn't sufficiently provided for. Tesla avoids warranty repairs as much as possible by marking them as good will, denying warranties outright, doing stealth recalls, or patching issues via software to hide the failure until the car is out of warranty.\n\nTesla solar is basically dead as a business. The solar roof was stillborn. Tesla semi, the cybertruck, the roadster, and the robot are all vaporware at best, it not actual fraud too. Unlike fsd, they didn't sell them at least.\n\nAll the fraud stuff won't matter legally until Tesla goes bankrupt. They're gonna go bankrupt because like Enron, their numbers are severely massaged and they're not a super profitable company like their financial reports claim, they're at best a barely profitable company whose structural finances collapse when they don't have exponential sales growth."
