POST_TEXT: b'Hey everyone.\nI have two covered calls contracts that have gotten away from me -theyre deep in the money.\nTSLA $185 July21. Tesla is at $250+ now. \nAside from rolling up and out, or buying to close, whats a better to way to avoid assignment while keeping some profits beyond $185?\n\nAppreciate the help!'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 11:39:27'] There is no "better" way. There are only a lot of shitty ways. Hopefully you wrote the strike so you will net a gain on share assignment? You didn't write the strike below you share cost basis, I hope? Taking assignment is a winning outcome if you selected a strike for a gain on the shares, so just be satisfied with that. I know the FOMO of that huge coulda/shoulda/woulda gain is hard to swallow, but every other alternative may be worse.You'd have to be very, very confident that you will make up the cost of a rescue plan, like buying the call back, to make it worth rescuing a winning trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 11:39:34'] You could try selling puts to recoup some of the lost profit. I am in the sane boat having sold 6/16 $205 calls
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 12:20:12'] I assume you collected the premium when the stock was BELOW 185. So while you are losing out on this Moon shot, you are still making money. That is the way CC work. Anything you do will only cost you money. Further, there is no guarantee that Tsla continues this blow off.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 12:18:31'] Did you sell these over 60 dte? What was the thought process of not managing earlier? At the end of the day this is a winning trade.You could roll up but you should dig around expiration etc to see where you get the biggest premium . Personally if you're willing to take the risk you should probably roll this up till after earnings which is around 45 days because that's where you're going to get the most premium. You could even potentially roll up further into a debit but just make sure whatever you're paying is less than the width that you're expanding toSo you might pay 5 dollars to get 10 extra dollars (net 5)Also you have to still be bullish or at least to whatever your short strike is going to be
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 12:55:46'] Just let them get called them buy the shares back. What’s the big deal.  Why does everyone want to roll up call.  The loss in capital gains will be same.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 16:28:08'] There is no way to do better than what you described. What I do is to roll the calls to 90-130 DTE (or further away) to minimize risk of early assignment. And roll again when they approach 60 DTE. Roll away and up but for a credit.Then I convert the trade into a strangle by selling a put. When selling a put you commit to buy 100 shares so make sure you have cash to cover it. If not I sell a put spread, but a strangle is the best because it helps rolling the entire structure up and down as needed for a credit.Then work out of the hole, roll them up little by little, strike by strike until you get them otm.Also I sell shorter term puts so I can repeat the process again and again, e.g. 130 DTE calls but 7 DTE puts and so on. Play with it and see what is the best.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 20:42:11'] You’re supposed to hedge before you open a position. Your shares are the hedge by the way. Right now you’re just betting if TSLA goes up even further or not.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:27:47'] I sold 2 covered calls of TSLA Sept 15 $200 C when TSLA was in the $160s. Fortunately for me, I have another 500 shares to be grateful for. We live and learn. Good luck to you going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 15:00:17'] This won’t help you now but I start to sell puts when my covered call goes deep ITM. If it keeps running I keep selling more. Hold them as long as I’m comfortable. If the stock reverse’s then I take some of the puts off the table.Unfortunately this happened to my NVDA and MSFT and PLTR
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 16:17:34'] I’m in the same position but I had been actively managing by rolling it up and out every week or so. So far, it’s becoming a losing proposition as I now have my covered call expiring 6 months out at $240 strike.The way I look at it is by considering the covered call as guaranteed income over time. If I roll out a covered call for minimal credit into next month, I consider this to be “dividend” or income at the same strike. If I roll it up and out, I will likely have to pay the difference but the jump in strike prices is also considered “deferred dividend”.Here is an example using your expiration and strike:If you roll out to the same strike to next month, you will receive an income of $190. Two months will give you $410 in income. Three months will give you $730 in income. Assuming these prices are accurate, the best bang for the buck is the 3 months as it guarantees you $240 a month.If you want to roll up and out, you can pay now to guarantee slightly higher income. Next month, $5 strike higher ($190) would offer you $240 instead of $190. The next month, $5 strike higher ($195) would offer you $565 instead of $410. $5 strike higher ($200) would offer you $1,040 instead of $730.If you are confident about where $TSLA price will be in the next six months, then be willing to pay upfront to guarantee income by that date. For example, I believe $TSLA will remain above $250 by January 2024. So I would pay $2,680 to guarantee me $3,800 in actual income or $630 a month.But because you’re paying upfront, you now have no leverage to use cash to get into more aggressive positions such as buying ATM or OTM call options for $TSLA.Let me know if this helps.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 16:43:43'] 225 this friday.....I know how you feel.   Just pray Elon opens his mouth with something silly and buy out of it when it tanks.   Other than that, you have to do the math and see if it's worth it to buy back and hope it keeps going up.   I tried to buy mine back last week and my limit order never hit......oh well
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 18:28:13'] Hopefully your strik was above your cost basis and you will make profit on assignment.  Afterwards, you can keep selling CSPs at $185 strike to collect premium while you wait for the downturn to come.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 20:06:10'] Had 192.5 calls expiring this friday. Just closed the position out for pretty much max profit and be done with it. At least its not on my screen giving me those should hv could hv thoughts. Hoping Powell puts some temporary brakes!!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 17:24:37'] Roll them for another month - Aug18 , or something like that. You get a little more coins , will be locked for another months and if TSLA drops you'll keep your shares. Not sure what benefit of keeping shares though, if TSLA drops.    No regrets on missing gains - think of it as part of a bigger scheme. So if you have use for those money then let the calls get assigned and follow the plan. If you have no good ideas for those money, roll for another couple weeks at the same strike, get more theta money, and make plans.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:00:48'] The max profit on a covered call doesn't actually feel too great does it

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 14:03:56'] Tsla is so volatile i dont like long dated calls with it. If i was in your position i would let it get called away and start selling puts. If you want to write long dated options you should probably run a spread. I.e. you sold 185 calls, you could have bought 190 calls as insurance. Then you could have exercised yur calls and onky been out the 5$ difference
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 14:34:38'] Just today I rolled my short Jul 2023 $205 call to  $240 Jan 2024 for ~$3/share.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 15:56:59'] are you thinking about buying the call back? maybe after a dip. you can finance the cost with by writing puts on tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 16:35:53'] Reverse buy write
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 05:42:35'] Never write a CC on a meme stock, learned that hard with GME
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 09:01:16'] This is the “risk” of selling CCs. You limit your upside while limiting your downside..Regardless, you are making a small profit on the shares when assigned, plus whatever premium you got.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 03:30:26'] It’s so oversold right now, I would buy the TSLA $250 July 21, sell you shares and let some cash sit as margin for the bear spread.  I would expect TSLA to retrace to at least close to 200,   So the $7300 call you sold will only be worth $1500 at TSLA $200.  You keep the 6K profit now, buy the $2k spread insurance, and profit as it falls.  It’s a directional gamble though.  Otherwise just let them get called away.Honestly I think it could be lower than $185 by July 21.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 11:50:22'] Market risk is increasing - wait till July and then if still deep in money, roll out to August for additional premium credit. Or you can roll now. I am in similar boat but have a significant profit (selected Strike price at my sell target price)

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 13:43:37'] Sold a put? After 5 green days in a row right into resistance? I am glad you are excited for selling your first option contract but do not forget to set a stop loss and a take profit block. 1 month DTE is plenty of time for TSLA to retrace to 170 and maybe lower if you plan on holding til expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:03:37'] 6/23 is a long time in TSLAland, for reference it was $170 last Thursday and today it peaked at $193 then promptly went back to $185. Next week we could either see $200, $160, or whoever knows; the high IV makes it pretty great for a weekly play.If you’re happy with owning TSLA at 167.4, great, otherwise you’re picking up pennies in front of a freight train.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 08:54:18'] Why has selling a put made you change how you perceive the risk of trading Tesla shares?I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself getting excited about entering a position when all the risk is still to come. Close it for a profit or wait for it to expire worthless and then celebrate
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 09:12:03'] I mean, the country could default and Tesla could drop to 120 and you'd be assigned. I'm usually all for selling puts and calls, but I want the moronic debt ceiling to be resolved first.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 21:58:32'] Selling options and collecting premiums is a great way to add some income into your trade/investment journey. 1 important thing I have learned about options is exercising- patience.  Technical chart is your friend. Use it. TSLA looks a little high right now, will probably wait for it to drop a little further before selling a put, or like many here have said, wait till the debt issue settled before entering. Otherwise all the best to the put you have just sold.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 07:25:46'] To me, selling contracts on bigger names is not just safer but a show of progress. I have built up my acct enough to make these trades.. to add to this, as long as you are fine with the possibility of getting assigned, then there is almost no real risk anyway.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 15:58:19'] Don’t want to pour water on your excitement but selling puts is for more experienced and they get it wrong a bunch.  Better—just don’t do it.  Additionally if your naked, then it is a terrible idea and blows up accounts.  Instead pick a less volatile and smaller priced stock if you feel the need to fill your craving.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 14:19:20'] Um, I've done this by accident but alwasy bought to close within 90 seconds, TSLA was last at that level Wednesday around the open.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 18:08:52'] This ends only two ways. You get lucky with Tesla staying up and you instantly become over confident in how easy it is to make money selling puts. Option 2 is Tsla goes back down and you lose your money x100, making you realize options trading can be painful. I guess option 3 is that Tsla whips up and down violently as it usually does and you die of a heart attack from watching it so closely as we all probably did on our first trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 19:52:18'] Tsly does the heavy lift (albeit at a fee) but the capital risk is much lower
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 20:15:10'] My 2 cents. If you get 20% profit on any day, exit out of the position. Tsla is mother of volatility and you don't want to cry after a month.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 21:49:47'] The higher the yield, more than likely the higher the risk. Annualized you are looking at excess of 15%
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 04:19:43'] What a round about way of saying. Was selling tesla put a good trade or not til next month. What are you guys opinion?...
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 08:34:37'] You must be down around $300-400 today, I imagine.  If the current Three Falling Peaks pattern plays out, TSLA will be down somewhere between 140-150 by late June.  That would price your Jun23 170P at around $20-$30.  That's a ten bagger!... except in the wrong direction. I'm not wishing a bad outcome upon you.  But I hope you are starting to see that the risk/reward on writing options is not for beginners.  You sold at relatively low volatility, near resistance, during bearish price action, with only hope and no plan to guide you.  Basically all of the mistakes you could make on a short put, you made.  At least use vertical spreads, if you must short options.  Similar upside potential, but your downside is capped.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 08:41:28'] Sorry for your loss.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 04:46:43'] I sure hope you have 160k to spare cos that bad boy can get assigned at anytime. Look for stocks in lower prices... leave the big boys alone, unless ofcourse you want to own them

POST_TEXT: b'I am contemplating if I should just buy stock or selling put. Anyone playing TSLA option? If so, what strike are you comfortable with expiration.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 10:01:51'] Current price of TSLA is 160.39 as of this writing.  If you are long TSLA and your target price is 190 by July here is a trade with a trade plan that you can look into for demo account only. It is for a long diagonal: Buy 1 July 165 call and Sell 1 May 170 (35 delta) call for a debit of 10.50.  Risk is 10.50 to the downside which will be realized if TSLA drops to 85 based on risk graph.  There is also a 5.50 risk to the upside if TSLA rallies to 300 by May expiration.  This is a long delta and long theta position.How to manage if TSLA goes down: Sell to close position if TSLA underlying is less than 149.88.  This will result in a $170 loss based on risk graph. At this point, consider buying stock if you are still bullish.  This would have saved you $1000 had you bought stock at 160 (current price now), and then it dropped to 150 which would result is a $1000 loss on paper.How to manage if TSLA goes up:  If TSLA rallies to 169 before May expiration (25 DTE) Buy To Close 170 call and Sell To Open June 180 Call 35 delta (or whatever delta that will net a credit)  for a credit.  You will now have a  July 165/ June180 call long diagonal.  If TSLA continues to rally to 180, Buy To Close 180 and Sell To Open July 190 Call.  The end result will be a July 165/190 Bull call spread.  At expiration, if the 190 is ITM, you can close as a spread, Sell to Close 165/190 for a credit of 25.00 at MOC.  If the 190 is not in the money at expiration, you can exercise your 165 call if you desire is to own the stock.  You will have the right to buy TSLA for 165 and sell CC or whatever your heart desires.  If any of the short strikes do not get touched, let the calls expire and sell weekly 35 deltas.  To summarize, you are selling 35 delta and buying to close and rolling when those deltas hit 48-50 when they are ATM and then selling a further out 35 delta or whatever strike will net a credit.    As I mentioned earlier, this position is long delta so as long as you close the shorts early enough before the deltas get too large, your position will profit each time you roll for a credit.  Your 165 longs will have a larger delta than the new short call's delta each time to roll.  What do you guys think?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 20:10:17'] I sold five puts in Nov 22 before the huge drop in Dec. All of them got assigned at $145-$160. Wasn’t fun holding 500 shares when it was trading below $110. I have another put $165 expiring 19 May.Not worried as my thesis for selling the puts is intact. I also only sell covered calls at $200 and above when premium is juicy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-24 21:45:37'] Below $150 sounds pretty sweet.   I sold a put at 149 and another at 155. Probably going to roll my 155 out and down to 150 or 145 if I can do it profitably.   Sell near the money on 0 DTE. Youll get a good entry point and a shitload of premium. Then sell deep out of the money calls
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 02:01:57'] if you are comfortable buying at current price, you can sell puts ITM (\~170-180s) and 1-2 months out so you get good premium. If the price goes above, you get the premium if not you are buying strike-premium price. Or go deep OTM (140-150s), less premium but either you get to keep smaller premium or way discounted stock below $150.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 20:28:24'] The reason someone would buy deep ITM puts would be because theta is low so the price doesn't decay as fast as ATM, and also the delta is higher so the price will move similar to the stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 21:44:37'] RSI doesn't mean anything by itself. RSI can help you add confidence to an entry based on price action or other technical signals. Especially on an individual stock, which might register as overbought on any time period's RSI but continue to run up for another 10% or more. RSI can be very powerful during a period of sideways movement to help you grab the top and bottom of a channel, but we're going through a major trend right now so momentum indicators don't say anything actionable other than "yes, we're going up."I would absolutely expect a modest pullback on TSLA within the next week or so, but I think using RSI as your entry trigger was a mistake, and you didn't buy enough time on an option with no intrinsic value. A $215 put expiring in July would be a much lower risk trade with a good chance of returning a 30-50% profit if it pulls back this week, and an opportunity to exit at a moderate loss if it keeps running.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 22:27:25'] You have a little time on your PUT. I have covered calls with a $235 strike I got right before market close. AH is screwing me hard. A nice pull back tomorrow would pay a premium, but we shall see.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 01:59:57'] This is completely equivalent to a cash secured put. You are literally reinventing the wheel.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 03:55:23'] If it works, you make 4% a month.  Projecting that out 12 months is wishful thinking.    During the October series last year, TSLA fell about 90 points.  Assuming that returned similar numbers as your example, it would take 3 successful cycles to make up that point loss.  But could you?    Suppose you bought at $300 and sold the $275 CC for $37.  It drops to $210. Your short call expires.  Cost basis is $263 ($53 loss).  Now you're either going to have to write a lower strike that locks in a loss or you're going to have to sell an OTM CC with a further out expiration in order to get enough premium to break even (60 days, 90 days?).  How many months does that take? This all works until it doesn't.    CCs and CSPs of the same series are synthetically equivalent.  Why do this in two transactions (stock + CC) when you can do it in one (CSP)?  Fewer commissions, fewer fees, less bid-ask slippage.    Wash sales are meaningless as long as you are out of the stock by the end of the year and you stay out for 30 days.    If you are fine with owning the stock at the net cost (stock price less premium received for the CC), go for it.  But risking money because the premium is high isn't the best choice.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 05:29:40'] If you buy the shares for $196.48 and sell the 31Mar23 170C for $33.25 and share price is below $170 at expiration then technically your cost basis hasn't dropped.  You will have collected $33.25 on one trade and your account will still show a cost basis of what you paid for the stock, which, in this example, would be $196.48.For tsla to drop below $170 at expiration on 31mar23 it would require a 13% drop in value, which is nothing for tsla.  Just look at price change from 2dec22 to 4jan23 to 2feb23.  It went from $194 down to $108 and then back at $188. So it drop 44% from 2dec22 to 3jan23 and then rose almost 75% from 3jan23 to 2feb23.Never sell covered calls on stocks that you don't want to own.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 06:17:51'] The problem I see is you are taking on the downside risk of it dropping 50% but limiting your upside to 4%.  If you own Tesla you are taking on a good amount of risk you want the chance for a large amount of profit too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 04:58:30'] Consider this.   Instead of doing it monthly.   Do it weekly but not on Monday.  Write the call option that pays you around 1.8-2.1%.   Stocks at 10$ per share.   Write the 11$ call.  They are out there.  Mostly on the stocks that have just had big moves.   This way you’re only on a 3 day period and there will be less time for a major move.   Obviously don’t do this during earnings week.    Do the math on the weekly’s.    You can always dump the stock if it’s dropping and leave yourself naked.   But you’d only be doing that with maybe a day or a half day left on the contract.    Compound 1.8% weekly for a year and even if the stock goes up and you get called out.    Fine.  More profit.   🤑.     Stocks Im doing this with.   RIVN-BHC-PLTR-UBER-BBBY (I know but because I’d the action on BBBY the premiums are juicy!  💰.    DKNG-LMND.   GL GL🍀🍀
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 04:07:45'] Another thing to consider is whether or not you’re using a cash account or margin account. While the return may look better using a cash account, it will look much different using a margin account. Just take a look at the margin requirements for both. The premium for the put is smaller than the premium collected for the covered call, but the margin requirement will be smaller as well. Return on margin capital will be very similar.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:07:54'] I cringe every time I see "deep ITM" and "sell to open" in the same sentence.Anyone who calls themself a "wealth architect" might as well have "scammer" tatooed to their forehead.The trade scheme boils down to selling overpriced volatility. That's standard credit trading mechanics and can be accomplished any number of ways, most of which, IMO, have better risk/reward and other characteristics. For example, you could obtain a similar rate of return by rolling OTM short puts, only the puts should have less opportunity cost.> Wash sale rule could cause tax implications if you rebuy shares that are called away without waiting 31 days (i.e. must pay taxes on the full premium received, but can't write off the "loss" of the shares).As long as you close the washing trade in the same tax year, this is a non-issue.> There is no upside potential if the stock moves higher.Yes, but that's true of all credit trading and/or delta-neutral strategies for selling overpriced vol. So not really a negative.> Lower risk to the downside on the trade (compared to selling OTM covered calls).I understand why you think that, but it's basically not true. They both have the same downside risk on the stock side. In the ITM CC case, you got more upfront premium, but at higher risk of assignment with attendant higher loss of potential gains on the shares. In the OTM CC case, you have less upfront premium, with lower risk of assignment and lower potential loss of gains.> If the stock does drop significantly, your cost-basis/breakeven has been lowered considerablyThat's just a restatement of the previous "advantage".To me, the biggest negative about the scheme is that it is grossly inefficient of capital. There are more efficient ways to use that amount of capital or better ways to use less capital for the same risk/reward.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:40:04'] Just stick with at the money and go in and out of the trade according to whether the market is oversold/overbought. Going super deep ITM on a covered call you have to hold for a year sounds stupid.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 15:25:51'] Tesla IV in that cycle is around 63, which means a one standard deviation move was about $36 from Friday’s close of 196.48. That call is not “deep itm” by any definition. You are correct that it’s the same as selling the 170 put. Which you might want to do if you have an opinion on the stock, but it’s hardly a free money trade considering that at the start of the year that put would have been in the money by $65.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 18:16:48'] The only time you should sell itm calls is when the stock is falling hard.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 22:41:09'] Tesla dropped from 200 to 100 in a month and stayed ~120 for 3 weeks and then recovered to 200 in a few weeks.

All that technical analysis and fundamental analysis go by wayside once your emotions and  temperament get challenged. People don't understand that it's the execution itself, where most fall or succeed. This is why we have trade management so we can have some control over our trade, but realizing there's no control over the market.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-02 09:16:58'] A few thoughts:1. If you’re just looking to speculate on price the stock has the highest delta and the lowest (zero) risk for all of the other Greeks. 1. Your argument for why it should go up is pretty thin but would is a good hypothesis for formulating such an argument. Can you quantify the number of cars sold? Approximate a margin? Go as far as to estimate earnings per share this quarter? 1. Can you extend the above to go as far as estimate a target price?Without the above you’re just blindly throwing darts.

For the last 90 days no one wants to know this guy , he comes on hard with a bravado speech and the stock shoots up 50%? Let’s not forget that at 50% increase the stock is still down 60% from 347  the post split price No more talk about Twitter- it disappeared along with 50 billion ? The stock at 130 might be half worth it , I cannot believe what I see- but ,,,Perception is everything , and investor day is coming - 200 is probably a price target So move over Powell - move over weak consumer - move over recession and high interest because here comes Elon Have we all gone crazy ???

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 21:45:31'] Definitely not.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 23:24:37'] I wouldn't bet against it until you see a clear reversal. If you think that fair value is at 140, there is time for you to react when the reversal is on its way. Here's a personal example of a mistake I made being committed to puts on tesla: [https://imgur.com/a/VWcazoV](https://imgur.com/a/VWcazoV)When I opened the put, I figured fair value is about 100. After earnings and listening to Aswath Damodaran, I'm convinced it's about 130. But I would not be shorting now. I made some back by doing 8 DTE calls with tight moving stop losses as the stock rose yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 02:03:58'] As someone who lost 100% of the put play on TSLA earnings, I would advise against buying them, but maybe for trading spreads where if it does not work out, you will be out a little bit, if at all. Like a March/April calendar at 140, for example.Earnings were a binary event and the books were manufactured, but no one seems to be seeing through the pump and dump they did by reducing the price at the end of the quarter. Such are cult stocks. Now you are betting on a reversal without any binary events, so the price might drift sideways or even higher by the time the puts expire.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 07:30:46'] Wait until 200+ before considering. This is a short squeeze and unless they want to continue selling off the market to hold on(like they did in the last hour) then shorts are gunna keep closing out their positions sending it higher.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 10:55:28'] Ah yes take out a large put play based on your gut feeling that seems smart
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 21:00:49'] Imma see what it does monday
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 12:10:24'] Understand that what just happened was a binary event - twitter the brand destruction- that’s what took it down to 101. Tesla is a real company , that stands alone as the only EV car maker that can successfully build and deliver . I can see where 195 is the new support level and short term , go to 225 . Comes April when the new earnings are due , if the numbers aren’t there , if dropping the price clips the margins, I could see a fallback to 175. You might want to test that 140 put more towards the middle of the year as the recession sets in .
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 15:08:17'] Very short term short position imho,  looks like $270 area is next area of resistance. But I don’t have a crystal ball. Tough for me stand in front of this much momentum but you never know.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:46:11'] I sold covered calls at its lowest with a 140 strike and managed to roll them out to June before earnings ... and I really hope you're right!There is definitely some illogical exuberance going on, but I need to just wait until it drops again to a point where I can buy to close my calls. I wish you luck with your puts. May Musk put his foot in his mouth in both of our favors.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:06:39'] Twlo was a stock I didn't mind to own beginning of the year.I learned that this is beautiful in theory but in practice it's hell. I rolled it  like crazy,  ended up with a contract on 2023 thinking that I would have time for it to recover.Good assigned at 160 in  july lol.In the end was better to have the stocks earlier, at least I could sell aggressive CCs / collars / covered strangles and reduce my cost. My total loss in the moment is 6k.I think it's quite possible to have it happening in your case as well.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 14:23:48'] If the pro's  exercise these puts early is basically an interest rate calculation.  If they exercise their puts and buy the corresponding calls, they will have synthetically the same position.If they exercise, they get short stock (this creates a credit balance which they receive interest on) and they no longer pay (or not receive the interest on the price of the puts.  If this carry cost/benefit is more than the corresponding calls, you are at risk of early assignment.When this is the case, there will be no extrinsic value left in the puts.  As mentioned by another poster, there is currently about 3 points of extrinsic value in the puts, so not likely just yet.  As time goes on, this extrinsic value will disappear.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 13:50:27'] Your odds are pretty good. Of being assigned. What exactly- who knows - but ur honestly probably eating shit on this. Happens to all of us man. I've been early assigned the dumbest things. Hopefully you're not destroyed by the position. I remember closing PTON puts out for 5k loss/per contract when it hit 120ish. Hurt at the time but still one of the best losses I ever took.   Cut bait and move on.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 15:28:51'] Who cares about early assignment? Guessing those puts are 100 delta each right now.  So getting assigned really changes nothing unless you would have to use margin to afford the shares. Sell calls against the puts or something imo. But either way you should have cut the position a long time ago.  Also, fwiw, selling 2024 expiry naked options makes very little sense.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 16:35:56'] For the near term, odds are high that TSLA is only headed in one direction.TSLA can drop to $60 and still have the same market cap as Toyota  [https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers-by-market-cap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers-by-market-cap/)  Toyota makes about 9 million cars per year.

Writing calls, and then closing out the captured premium in profit, and then using that premium to sell off the shares.   Started at 1500, now a little under 1200.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 05:59:02'] If it’s any consolation, I sold $300 puts and rolled it out repeatedly until I got assigned. You will get assigned sooner or later when the opposite side believes it’s time to get out of their short. Take it as a slight bullish signal if you do because your stock is likely to go back up (though a far cry from $226).

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-24 07:35:52'] You sold TSLA puts at 226 - you sold them some one bought them - whoever has the contract on the long side is waiting to see how far down this goes . There is a TSLA report on Q4 22 sales due out Jan 4. The smart money says they miss the analysts number by at least 15,000 cars . Not good . The bank has a margin on TSLA 13 billion dollar loan to fund TWTR - the lower TSLA goes the more stock gets sold on margin . I just read the Shanghai plant is closed. TSLA earnings comes out Jan 25 th . They will probably scrape by on top and bottom line. All eyes will be on the guidance . What can Musk say positive ? A share buyback . Musk is a cagey shrewd businessman. He might want to deflate shares making a buyback cheaper , and calling in more shares. A reverse dilution makes his shares worth more - less in the market to buy . Driving the price up could be a result of that . Of course TSLA in its present state might not have the free cash flow to buy back 10-15 billion right now . They didn’t have it to buy TWTR . Their brand is wrecked right now , Musk is distracted with TWTR. No one is flying the TSLA plane it’s on autopilot. Your problem is : (1) As soon as the stock significantly rises on an announcement the holder of the long put will sell  . That will lead to an assignment . (2) As of closing you are -103.00 per share in the red , the difference between your strike and the price . Each option you sold is - 10,300 at present . If you only secured the put with 10,000 - the exchange house will sell off 300 from your equity account - at that point they may close you out of the trade as your debit exceeded the CCP. Or , you can give them more money and hope that TSLA will go back up - but what if it dips to 90? Another 30 points is about 3000 per option more of your money gone. Chances are as soon as the stock goes up 5-10 points you will be assigned and lose between 9000-10000 per option written

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-20 20:19:24'] What do you mean by “unhedged calls” at 160 and 170?  Unless you are speaking from first hand knowledge about a specific firms open positions then you have zero idea if the position is hedged or not.  You can hedge the delta on short calls many different ways - long underlying, long other strikes, other expirations, short puts, and those are just options within Tesla.  You can also partially offset risk with other ETFs that contain TSLA or any other asset that you think is correlated to directional moves in TSLA.

I keep seeing bad numbers from tsla, but twitter seems to also add to the chaos. If Musk finds a new Twitter CEO quickly, I think that would make Tesla bounce up a bit.

This analysis is for Options expiring on Friday January 6th, 2023.\n\n* TSLA continues to have a steady positive outlook, based on a bias towards CALLS over PUTS, however, the market isn't as bullish as it was prior to 12/27 (image 1)\n* All OTM strikes have over 100% IV, this means that the market is fairly indecisive about the direction of the moves but expects the moves to be of significant size.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 13:13:17'] I disagree with your support levels. $100 would be a psychological support with $64 being the most long term MAJOR actual support where the most buying and selling actually took place.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 10:01:50'] Not touching this. On a strict volatility play you'd have an 80% chance of profit based on the last 2 years of data and a 20% chance based on the cliff starting in September.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 09:23:08'] There was easy money to be had with TSLA puts in december, now it'll probably just jump around erratically. Technically selling puts way down could work well but I'm just not in the mood to touch this radioactive stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 13:12:20'] With the amount of times you cross posted this analysis someone might think you have ulterior motives. If you must know; We are ready to buy back in on TSLA at $50, $25, and $15.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 16:49:31'] This is a close one.  I would say some of these puts, but not most, will be exercised.The key is to look where the stock is trading from about 515pm to 530pm.  The cutoff time to notify the OCC for a contrary exercise is 530pm, although in practice brokers/firms may have an earlier cutoff time.  At 520 it was 150 and then slipped just below by 530.  If I had to guess, I would say you will be assigned on 1 of your short 4 contracts.  Please let us know the results.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 18:06:14'] If you catch them. Sell otm weekly covered calls
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 16:33:43'] It depends, I think it's happened to me maybe 25%-40% of the time. I dispise being assigned stock. Usually if I get assigned stock my risk go through the roof and my profit cueing doesn't really increase. The more I do options the less I want to have it assigned. Answer, it really varies, I think it's happened noticeably below 50% of the time but not less than 25% of the time to me. Also, to be assigned stock you usually have to have the contract expire and on Friday or the last day of the week(not always friday) it's possible to assign it on expiration day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 18:13:44'] Options can be exercised till 5:30 pm ET on the day of expiration. So yes, there is a possibility that you’ll be assigned.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 06:08:28'] Here we go again , WHATS THE BIG DEAL bwint assigned??? So tired of this narrative of fearing assignment, sell the damn stock as soon as it’s assigned.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 16:47:44'] I would assume you are the owner of 400 shares (90% probability); you will get notified sometime Saturday if that is the case.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 17:28:05'] This is the fun part. Hopefully Elon does not do more dumb shit over the weekend tho.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 17:47:50'] Looks like it. However, I expect a small rally next week before next leg down to 137 gap. Engulfing candles at bottom of a downward trend tend to by volatile so you should have an opp to close above 150 next week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 17:10:31'] Yes you will get some TSLA next time sell QQQ puts you should sell 160$ calls until assigned

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 20:00:41'] Remindme! 18 hours
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 06:53:04'] The market close price is what will be used as the auto assign process, and since it was above $150 at close this should not have happened.But, if it closed OTM and then went ITM between the close and about 5:30pm et then an option holder would have had to contact their broker and tell them to exercise.  Then your put would have to be randomly selected out of all puts left to expire to be assigned.  The odds are very low, but it could happen.  You should know by now (Sat morning) if it did or not and I agree that this concern about being assigned should not be a big deal since you didn't close the put to take off the risk . . .
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 09:32:46'] Always close your options sold. Always.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-17 10:14:58'] Even close to in the money is near 100% assignment nearly every time

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 16:59:51'] Depends on when it dropped .01 below 150.  If this happened before 5:30p ET, and stayed that way until then, you will likely be assigned.  AH goes on until 8:00p ET, the option exchanges do not.  No biggie.  TSLA is about done dying for awhile, or sell in premarket first thing Monday, lick your small wound that’s not going to be as big as the premium collected, and chalk it up to good luck and experience.  Also, if you’re going to trade options at that value level, learn about Limits.  Ask questions, we’ll explain.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 20:02:55'] How much premium did you take in on your $60,000 risk, or did you use spreads?Obviously you don't have to share that, but I'm curious as to why you did a 0dte on TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 17:34:18'] What is your expiration? Unless it is expired today - despite your put are ITM - there is extrinsic value so you will not get assigned yet. If it expired today - and its in the money - yes you will get 400 shares on Monday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-16 17:57:50'] You might depending on the AH action. It’s not just price at the close. Immediately sell ATM calls or ITM if you’re aggressive. Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 02:09:41'] earnings is always a crapshoot. But I am looking closely at tsla, as it has been holding up well in this market chop fest. If we do resolve this chop to the upside, I think there's a good chance we see tsla take off. the chips and AI plays are extended, aapl is aapl, the remaining high beta megacap that's acting as safe haven from the regional bank crisis that hasn't left the station are tsla and amzn. Last week, it formed a consolidation range around the 20d MA, which I will use as my risk. If it goes up, you have both delta and IV working for you going into earnings, but I'd probably take profit on most into earnings, and perhaps sell some higher strike contracts if I do end up holding into earnings.I also think it's a mistake to look at open interest in that manner. you don't know whether those are bought or sold, part of a spread, covered call or hedge against a short. it's a roadmap to nowhere.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 19:06:11'] I am betting on TSLA on the next earnings call, but not that far out. Although I think it is completely possible for TSLA to make new ATH this year. Its revenue and profit growth is solid with a really low P/E ratio given past metrics and other stocks with similar growth. If TSLA can deliver record profits it will send a strong message to the market and fix its current evaluation. I hold massive amounts of TSLA shares in my tax free account, but as always me trading TSLA vs me investing in TSLA are 2 totally different things.

What happens to the model when they grow 24% or more for 3-4 years and use a discounted cash flow model of 10-15%. Sure there’s risk in looking farther out. But it’s also in the realm. That’s why there’s such a large range in the stock analysis.  Every year the analysts say it’s going to grow 20-25% and end up growing 40-50%. Not arguing with the price. Just stating the possibility is the divergence.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-14 03:54:08'] I think this shows why it's extremely important to first have a great understanding of the field each company operates in. As an automotive guy, I think there's 0 chance of Tesla continuing to grow 24% / year. The market they operate in is "worldwide car sales". At some point they'll all be electric and that's the maximum Tesla can hope for. Then, how much of that market can they capture? With its current lineup (including CT), they're capped at around 2m cars. And are looking at a compressed profit margin due to competition.

POST_TEXT: b'Tesla earnings call is tomorrow Jan 25th. The Street has a love hate relationship with Elon, TSLA has taken a beating for a couple of months, but showed signs of recovery in the last week. This is how things look at the moment in the options market expiring on Jan 27:\n\n* TSLA momentum has been moving upwards since last week. Now, we have crossed the 80th percentile. We have had a momentum this strong since last July/August, which makes sense because TSLA just hit a bottom two weeks ago. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/www8m3ezuzda1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e41c3f6736921b59dd18230e9b699af720a58c72\n\n* The options market is generally biased towards calls over puts, which signals a bullish sentiment \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nh69ytp0vzda1.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b2423e79c8d68a8881ef886589255d2390754930\n\n* The next major resistance level is at strike $150, there is a massive build up of almost 10K new contracts added to this strike since yesterday.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 12:43:23'] I'm new-ish to options, so I tried running a straddle scenario through the numbers last night for Tesla's earnings day. My conclusion was that it would take an out-of-the-ordinary move in response to the earnings report to make a straddle likely to profit. All data, unless otherwise noted, was taken from E-Trade around 23:00hrs Eastern last night. Here's my math:* Price at close on 23 Jan  = $144.75* Max earnings move in last 6 quarters was 12% ($17.37 if closing price on 23Jan is used)* The premium for a $145 strike contract (1 put and 1 call) was $13.65 (or 9.43% of the close price of 23Jan) ... but I didn't note down when the contract expiration was for this. If I had to guess, I think it was the next monthly.* The underlying price would have to move above $158.40 or below $131.10 to be ITMGiven the premium would require a move over 9% to be ITM, and the largest recent earnings moves were 12%, this was unlikely to be a winning play.If there was more information available, maybe one would have more confidence in the move. TSLA being a volatile mess, I don't have the funds to risk just based on the above.... this is where someone points out my simple math mistakes, probably.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 07:40:52'] There are a lot of options depending on how bullish you want to remain on TSLA.1) More agressive move would be to sell calls (up to 2) against the position, shouldn't require any more capital and can reduce your directional risk. Where and how many you sell is up to you and how much you wanto to increase your break evens by. Selling 1x 135 call would make your trade delta neutral right now. If you want to keep being long TSLA You could sell further out of the money call and keep rolling the call down if Tesla keeps moving down. If you want to increase your break even sell closer to the money calls. Selling naked calls gives you the most flexibility to adjust the trade going forward.2) Sell the same ratio spread on the call side like you sold for the put side.2) Less agressive option would be to sell a call credit spread to increase your credit collected and get a better break even to the down side. Also, won't require any additional capital. Depending on how much credit you collected you could sell a call credit spread that collects enough additional credit to cover the width of the call spread and then you still have no risk to the upside. You can roll down the call spread if TSLA keeps moving down but you collect small credits to do it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 13:19:23'] I'd close it out and move on. Nobody knows what will happen to TSLA's stock price, but it could absolutely drop another 50% in market value in the next few months. The one-month and three-month charts look terrible. If another drop would cause you significant pain, your position is too large and you need to at least trim it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 10:48:04'] You were wrong. Take the loss and move on. Or wait and pray for a bounce.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-27 13:40:23'] This sounds like a Tony trade (it is). Basically he closed the vert 128/135, and sold a 155 call for 3.4  on 12/22 making it into a Strangle. Collecting about $11. After that I lost the thread. I assume he kept rolling the call down maybe into a straddle 128/128.If you a following Tony (I do) you should have a Tasty account to look at how he is managing problem trades. You do not have to follow , but should understand what he is doing.Edit: ok some of the trades were unclear but it seems he rolled down 4 more times, and collected 16.65 all toll, so he may only be out $1 right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 11:56:48'] A long straddle would require a very significant move to profit due to the IV crush caused by Vega that tends to occur after earnings announcements. So a long straddle would've best been opened before the IV ramp up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 10:01:25'] Can I use your post as a textbook example of why you should never write a covered call below the cost basis of your shares? It's remarkable how many people do this and then argue that there is no way that the price can go above the strike of their call, so there is "no risk" of being assigned for a loss on their shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 12:42:42'] Tough situation you’re in. For me it would all depend on the realized losses I’d have if the shares were called away/bought to close and my plan afterwards…
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 19:21:22'] Roll the calls as you get close to expiry. If your calls expire in April and you roll now you will have to pay debit.  It closer to expiry all value burns off and then even if you roll for flat strike, you can get credit.

You need to know what your plan is here , I would learn dynamic  stock if you like to own the stock. It is like the wheel but your holding the stock the whole time! You need to sit back , and reverse engineer to see what option you have to meet your goals! Do you want to grow your assest column,  do you want to create new money short calls , dividend, etc! Are you more of a trader where you care more about your net worth ! Some People just need to buy the business cheap , and write far otm calls to reach their goals!

I expect Tesla to be trading back near ATH in 2024. 2023 is going to be a shit show with Twitter and macro.I'm buying more 2025 LEAPs with every spare cent I have. Tesla is trading at a PE of 30 based on 2022 estimated earnings we will get in a few weeks. With 150% EPS growth rate that's a PEG ratio of 0.2. Anything under 1.0 PEG is usually a good deal, so .2 is an amazing deal.Edit: Why the downvotes?

I would recommend getting out on the next bounce and then waiting for the bull market to return and re-establish the position. I wouldn't even buy the stock yet. This could go way lower before panicking investors finally give up. Have the powder dry, park it in some low-beta ETF and wait.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 13:44:34'] Better off selling a straddle. Iv dump will be insane
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 13:35:01'] A straddle is the expected move on expiry... For TSLA, last I checked (market closed), a Friday expiry would cost you around $13. That's 9% move priced in for 2 days (25 bought, 26, 27). With longer-term straddle (2wks+), it must move violent enough so that your contract is worth more due to IV expansion and just "being very right". With short-term straddle like this, IV after earning will almost always stabilise and not "expand" like your theory. Now this does not mean that you will not profit, but you now rely on breaching BEP as opposed to just "being directionally right". If you breach BEP, in 2 days, IV crush does not matter. If you are confident that TSLA will be >157 or <131, do it, but your straddle will be in the red most of the time, until they breach either of those two walls. Have you thought about credit spreads instead?It will only be volatile, if on earnings call it shoots up from 144 to 154, then the morning after it craters to 134... if it continues to go up (or down), there is nothing volatile/unknown about it for the week, you just know where it is heading and IV will stabilise (or crush whatever you name it). But then with a very short-term straddle, pingponging like that will not get you money, that will just burn you the value of time (theta), and you will lose value. So no, if you want to buy long 26/1 straddles, your volatility thesis is likely wrong. Got to depend on breaching BEP by the 27th.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 15:39:58'] The strangle is better to be honest. You have more options to roll the untested side and go out in time for management. For a pre-earnings move that isn’t expected to go past the expected move. For joining a large move: I’d go long “not sell/write” a iron condor; it’s really good too. Not as sensitive to the IV crush and profits from major moves from the earnings announcement.If your going after earnings, might just want to do your standard bull call spread etc in the direction the stock is going.  Just some ideas.Edit: clarity additions.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 19:50:15'] Nope the iv pop will be before earnings not after. Buy the unknown sell the reality. Your a credit addle will get crushed after earnings. You got I backward.  You need s big move in either direction to cover the cost of options and to overcome the iv crush
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 21:13:55'] U need 20% move on both side to be profitable I would sell strangles

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 16:14:34'] Not sure why you are long the TWTR 60 strike calls. Elon Musk's bid is $54.20. Thus, it is very unlikely that those calls would have any value if the deal gets done or doesn't get done (TWTR stock probably falls down a lot).
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 16:09:11'] I mean.... riding it to zero is technically a strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 18:27:06'] Why do you have twtr calls for 60? Those are never going in the money since the buyout price is 54.20.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 19:47:07'] You went full dummy On the Twitter calls bud
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 21:26:59'] What the fuck. Bro these are garbage plays. The buyout for twitter is below the strike. Dump these asap
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 20:41:27'] They were bad picks. You can’t blame the losses in these trades on volatility. Twitter to 60? Really? They’ve been getting worse and worse even before the Elon bid. Also the Tesla puts are pretty far out of the money.  Even with its drop you need a ways to drop further and you’re approaching 1 month left so theta is killing you more than vix.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 21:10:31'] Just print out your trade confirmation hang it from your rear view mirror so you can have the best parking everywhere you go. 👍🏾
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 23:10:26'] Who in their right minds would bet against Tesla that far out of the money? Elon musk offered to buy Twitter at 54.20 dollars. Horrible plays, no research total ignorance and incompetence.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-11 18:39:50'] Roll your TWTR calls, $60 is above the buyout and if the deal is approved it will most likely zero out. Bad move

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 10:36:10'] You’d like to know which direction TSLA stock is going to move.  Don’t we all.  Fwiw, LEAPs with extrinsic value are expensive when IV is this high.  Better off buying shares if you’re making a directional bet that may take time to play out.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-03 12:03:26'] If you look at the chart where is the most PAIN.It's under $100. If the big players can force TSLA under $100 to about 85-90 all the novices will give up hope and sell the banks can buy it under 100 and hold for 5 years. Let it break below 100 before you buy those leaps.

I would buy once I see a nice uptrend .We might see $50 tesla if musk continues with his idiotic ventures and statements. I think he only owes 15% of tesla now so he doesn't care as much as people think and his lack of focus on tesla shows it .I wanna buy leaps as well but I am waiting for a strong TA signals which I don't see.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello, my broker somehow allowed me to sell to close Jan. 2023 500$ TSLA puts I had for about 2 weeks now for an insane profit. The order shows as "filled".\n\nMy question is will they revert it? Volume for the whole day on those puts is 2. The money even though not settled has been added to my account and my trade is showing on yahoo finance.\n\nEDIT: I don\'t think that I was clear, I didn\'t sell 500$ puts. I just closed my position which was 500$ puts for Jan. 2023. Bought for 18$ and seemed to have sold for 205.95$\n\nFinal update: Called my broker and was able to buy to open a 500$ put a minute before close for 205.65$. Made 30$. Would\'ve been on the hook for 25k if this wasn\'t done before settlement. Thanks everyone!'
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 08:35:51'] Im thinking you got confused after the split.  If you had a 500 put before the split, you would now have 3 166.67 puts. which are trading around 5.This would make sense as those are worth about 15 together, close to the 18 you paid.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 09:14:07'] You may have been able to sell this morning, but I would not be sure that your position is now closed. Sounds to me like you own a set of puts for around $166.66 after today’s split and are now on the hook for the $500 puts you sold this morning.Best of luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 09:22:33'] > Bought for 18$ and seemed to have sold for 205.95$Well either you are being bamboozled by fake news (because your broker hadn't updated gain/loss numbers for the TSLA split yet and you didn't actually get that much) or your broker made a big mistake in your favor by applying the post-split stock price to your pre-split contract.I'd bet money it was the former.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 11:46:20'] You sold a deep ITM put, only 3 traded today and one was at 205.95 (yours).  You needed to sell the 166.67p 3x as many.  There is no infinite money glitch.  Call your broker and cover your short put for a <$300 loss, then go sell your 166.67 for $5.  CALL THEM TO DO IT.  With splits their systems are probably all effed up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 13:18:25'] I think the split fucked with you. It sounds like you didn't close your put, but instead are now short a $500 (post split) Put.The $500 Put you bought turned into 3 $166.66 Puts after the split. Instead of closing them by selling 3 $166.66 Puts, you opened a new position by selling a $500 Put with TSLA's post split price. (You just sold a $1500 put on TSLA at presplit price).
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 09:20:00'] Too add to the other comments.  If your broker mistakenly showed you long the 500 puts and didn't take into account the split and adjust your position properly, you should contact them.  They may be willing to take you out of the error or at least work with you.
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 08:25:43'] Tesla is trading at $292.72 at the time of writing this. If you truly sold $500 strike puts you are so far in the money I feel like you should be more concerned with getting exercised than feeling like you made a profit…
	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 08:27:02'] So, TSLA had a stock split. A $500 put is very deep ITM right now.  The last trade was 205.95, which is about $100 in extrinsic (time) value, and $20,800 in intrinsic value.I'm not sure how you think you got away with something amazing here. Just know that you are on the hook to buy 100 shares of TSLA at $500, which last week was the equivalent of buying TSLA at $1500.EDIT: I can only see the value of the last trade--a third put sold at that strike. I don't see your two transactions in the level 2 data.

Other exchange centers would have a similar time frame.

Hedging also doesn't make sense to me as this often throws good money after bad as one side often loses while the other may win, and in some cases both sides lose, but to each their own.Unless you are willing to take the gamble it should be considered to close and reopen after the ER.

The difference between people who win at trading and those who lose is collecting profits and avoiding unnecessary risks. Is it sexy? No. Will it buy you a Lamborghini? Most likely not. But it will pay your bills. FWIW, you can make the play, be right and still lose.Tesla is a volatile stock with a somewhat fanatical fanbase that are likely to view a drop in earnings as a fire sale on their favorite company before it rockets to $500/share- which they are sure will happen any day now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 04:15:11'] Why not convert to a spread like 160 for next week and capture some high IV.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 04:17:21'] Sell premium against it. The drop in IV will crush you regardless of direction so hedging it topside limits profit but also limits risk. Price drops to 135 the hedge goes to zero you collect the premium. Now you can let time structure out and see if you can get a push back ITM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-24 10:27:55'] FWIW,  they could smash earnings and the stock can still tank.  If it was me I’d keep it.  You could always buy a put a bit OTM for after earnings.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-10 11:38:43'] EQS actually looks pretty amazing. However this year they won't make much impact on Tesla's dominant position. They haven't sold much at all. Maybe towards 3rd to 4th quarter of 2023 we might see what impact they have. But for now, they virtually have no impact yet. Meeting Production goal might be difficult too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 19:05:26'] Critique my plan. I am leaning towards selling credit spreads or diagonal after conference, getting out quickly at $150-200. However this would be my plan if I open all day:Most FOMC days have been red, yet tomorrow has pause expectation. This could send them to wild upswing when expectations are not met. I plan on entering a short-call ladder in the morning for 250-300 credit. If I could enter 4385c & 4360/-4340c for -300 credit, why shouldn't I? I need to make 4402 to profit, or it needs to go below 4343.10. 4402 represents 0.8% from today's close, and 4343.10 represents 0.7%. Pretty symmetric. Cheaper than a 4355/4385 strangle. Things I have considered beyond "it could end up at 4355, satisfies "red on FOMC statistics", and still kill you"1. **It is still a bullish strategy.** Why? Because if it goes up sharp, I can close the whole thing for big money in minutes. "Unlimited" upswing profit potential. The 4385c would love this, even at 4380 it would probably be profitable. 2. Yet when it goes down to 4330, due to elevated volatility and the nature of credit spreads in general, the short bear call will not be at full profit to negate the long call loss fast. It does come down to the most obvious point "it could ping pong and kill both legs."3. No amount of creative stop loss (closing short leg closing long leg etc) would save this because of the "wide-ish" bear put spread. Whereas with tighter width, in a swingy day you could potentially stop the short leg and let the long leg profit enough to cover the short leg shortcoming. 4. This needs to be opened now or early morning (I have IBKR and can do so), otherwise there will be no credit in the 2PM.5. I guess if SPX is stuck in between 4343 and 4360, I could open a short call at 4370, turning this into two bear calls for reduced loss (at that point there will not be profit anymore).NVM: I have 1 $25 bucks put butterfly centred at 4325 for the sell off protection. Will look at the candles around 2:00 and when he takes the podium.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 11:02:33'] How can one a really add cash into their portfolio with call options? I recently understood that if you buy 1 contract of x company who's share price is $100, that doesn't mean I have bought $1000 worth of shares because upon selling to close my call option if I see that the stock price went up to $120 after noting that the strike price was $99 and premium was $120, I don't make $80 ($200 - $120 = $80), unless I actually buy 100 shares at the strike price. So how am I really making a profit??? Is it all about getting a bid higher than the premium when selling to close my call option? If so, what makes a bid price go higher than the premium I originally paid? And if I am only going to make cash with the bid amount, why is there a need to do technical analysis or any analysis for that matter, plus why do we create such a big hype around options when we never even get to own 100 shares without paying for them?  I tried researching but I think an explanation leaning towards the layman type will make more sense! Please help. Thank you!

My understanding is that  this can be a high probability of profit, but I have less than a 10k account and looking at cheaper stocks in terms of dollar value just in case something goes funky and I get assigned (wouldn't be able to afford 100 shares of MSFT). I believe the bought put would cover this but feels it's still better to be safe. The issue is it doesn't seem as worth it on the stocks I've looked at (such as F) where the premium is quite low for the 7-14DTE. Would appreciate any tips on making this a viable strategy!

I realize I can let them get called away and still make profit but wanted to see if there’s a way to defend my position. I’ve already rolled these calls out and up to $7/share and they are now pretty far out and deep ITM. Any strategies I’m not thinking about that could help me extend my profit? I’m okay with letting them get called away if needed.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 14:23:14'] My question is about how low volume might affect options/taking profits. Let's say a stock has a share price of $5, but I think it's going to shoot up, so I buy 50 long calls at a strike price of $9, and then the share price spikes to $10 a few days later.Now I'm in the money, so let's say I want to sell all my calls and cash out. If this is a super low volume stock, would there be concern that no one will buy the contracts I'm trying to sell?Basically, I do think a similar situation could happen, so to maximize profits I want to buy calls instead of shares, but I don't want to be stuck holding calls that no one buys. Any insight or advice is greatly appreciated!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 14:25:00'] Hello! Usually trade on a weeklies or biweekly/s, but I was looking at buying some deep out of the money spy calls for cheap premiums. Specifically $465 8/18C. I usually sell my contracts well before they’re close to the strike, as I’d rather build off of $300 a week instead of making it big. What would be some of the drawbacks to buying said call to sell for 10-20% gains? I figure we probably aren’t hitting that strike, but there should be some money to be made on the way up? The few times I’ve gotten lucky have been on way out of the money calls and puts, but haven’t ventured into longer dated stuff.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 18:49:57'] A couple of questions for long time options experts.  I started selling options on few established stocks. Cash-secured puts only with OTM 30-40 days out at about -0.2 delta. Stocks that I wound not mine owning if I get assigned.   So far, I have not gotten assigned, so getting the premium is nice, but… It seems like in the last 30-60 days, the market is moving up while I’m sitting on the sideline. It feels like if I have just bought the stock or ETF I would have done better. Here are my questions:  \- In the long run, which one makes more sense selling CS-Puts and CC options or buying and holding stocks/ETFs?   \- If I want to get into SPY and hold for 3+ years, should I enter the market now with CS-puts and hoping to get assigned or just buy shares outright?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 19:29:23'] **What's going on with AMD? And should I wait or sell ASAP my AMD call options?**Today, when most tech stocks were up, the AMD stock went down, and it went down (interestingly enough) right when AMD unveiled their new CPUs/GPUs with AI capabilities.AMD $130 Call 6/16 \[Down -86.07%\]AMD $126 Call 6/16 \[Down -63.50%\]On CNBC, one of the market analysts was asked the very same question: what's going on and why did AMD go down? His response sounded uncertain, but he tried to explain that it has something to do with AMD's new AI products line-up NOT being immediately available for purchase and distribution. I think I remember him saying sampling will begin only Q3 and general availability only in Q4 and maybe Q1 2024. Apparently AMD's news wasn't good enough.So how come most AI-driven tech stocks went up (including NVDA!!!), but AMD went down? What could be a plausible explanation? And is it possible that bots and algorithms have taken over to work against the individual trader?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 06:36:46'] Hi everybody!I've read about options for more than a year now, and I'd like to think I now understand most of the fundamentals.I've been wanting to try it out slowly, and I thought selling covered calls (both as a hedge and an exit strategy) would be a good start.My question is more technical. What exactly happens if/when the buyer exercises? Will my shares be automatically sold at the strike price without any input from me, or do I need to do anything myself within the settling time frame?My question is essentially: can I keep selling the same covered call every other Monday (until the ticker reaches the strike price I'm happy to sell at), collect the premium each time, and then forget about it for two weeks? Or do I need to be ready to provide input when the call is getting exercised?I'm on IBKR if that changes anything.Thanks in advance!

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-14 17:14:20'] My question has been auto removed by the bot, will try it here:I am in the process of learning gamma exposure and gex stuff. I noticed on certain strikes gamma prices are higher than the rest. This past Monday afternoon, I noticed as price approaches strikes with high gamma, the gamma price balloons exponentially. I think it was around 432-433 area and create a squeeze like movement. However today afternoon after the fomc, as pricess approaches 435-434, the gamma price did not change much. Then we all know prices reversed back. Base on that, gamma prices obviously don't change the same rate as price moves towards the strike. My question is, what causes gamma/gex price to ballon in 1 scenario and another scenario there's little to no reaction? Is it because lots of calls were purchased to support the move on monday and barely any puts where bought in today's afternoon drop?

I understand that the options are not too actively traded, however, I did get filled at $7.0 and noticed that later trades got filled around $6.8.

On Friday, at expiry, if my total gain is still negative but underlying is above 9, I can just let the contract expire?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 09:14:54'] Could you give me your thoughts on this strategy? I have a strong belief that Oracle's stock will continue to surge in the coming days, surpassing its already impressive gains. This morning, I took a call option with a $125 strike price and a 36-day expiration. However, I'm aware that there's a possibility of a significant downturn if people start taking profits from today's rally. To hedge against this scenario, I also purchased a put option with a $125 strike price, expiring in 8 days. Do you think I should have refrained from spending the extra money? The reason behind my anticipation of substantial gains or losses is the recent behavior of the stock. If it experiences a sharp decline, I stand to profit; conversely, a significant climb would also be profitable. What are your thoughts on this? Alternatively, I'm considering selling my call option today to secure a profit and retaining the put option, as its gains can cover the cost of the trade. What do you think? I think long term it will go up but it may want to pull back substantially in the short term I want to take advatange of both outcomes

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 10:08:23'] Question on PMCC "Collateral" My strategy is to utilize a PMCC on an ETF (SPY or QQQ) but to sometimes close out my long leg to take profits and find a reentry point if my short leg (usually 30-45 DTE) isn't "making money" right away. The problem with this is it leaves my short leg naked for a very brief moment and therefore robinhood (please don't judge) will not let me sell my LEAP for profits since it is considered collateral (I don't own 100 shares either).    Since I don't want to close both legs at the same time so I can let theta do its thing with my short leg, my solution is to purchase an additional call as "backup" collateral, way OTM around $0.02 per contract. That way I can freely roll my LEAPS however I want in order to take some profits, with the cheap OTM call acting as my temporary collateral while I reenter with my LEAPS.    My question is, how stupid is this plan? I've been evaluating the risks of this but want to make sure I'm not overlooking anything. I am not concerned about short leg assignment, as I will be actively managing it and rolling it back out before it even gets to expiration.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-15 10:38:19'] Hi guys, I want to attempt the first quad-witching play! Likely plays XSP and not SPX, but example is given for SPX. Correct me if I am wrong...I indicated in the () where I have questions. 1. Suppose that at close today I buy a bear call ladder for a credit. SPX closes at 4410. So I opened a bear call ladder. -439c/441/444 for $110 credit. BEP is therefore >445.10, and <439.90. All expiring on 16/6 AM Expiration. It is clearly indicated on IBKR so I know it's AM.2. At 10:00 ish tomorrow, they will publish SET (where can I see this? CBOE website?). They will not be based on complicated mathematics with futures and whatnot, but rather just the open price of the SPX composition companies (correct?). 3. Let's say the SET on Friday AM is 4400 (XSP 440). Does this not mean I would lose money regardless where SPX closes? Because my guide is the SET. Why bother keeping the position open then? 4. If 3 is correct/partially correct, well since this is AM expiration, that bear ladder I purchased was really a bet on the opening price (SET). Would they expire right away an hour after SET is published? 5. I think 3 is where I am most wrong... Appreciate the correction.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-16 17:35:04'] Can you do it like this?Say you want to buy a straddle, but the prices are always terrible.  Instead of buying calls and puts at the same time, you buy one call.  As price goes down, you buy the rest of your calls.  But, if price raises, then you start buying the puts.This way, you (potentially) get into your position with better costs.

Clearly im bearish and thought the massive upside move on the stock was over done - only to see it have two massive days after that. Regardless of how wrong i was on my view, what could i have done better?  Lets assume the stock opened at >$40.  How would you hedge it out once the move to the upside started?  I didn't want to close the position as i still think we close below $40. should i have bought weekly $40 calls or $45 calls to hedge the upside? What else could i have done? Or was it better to close out the spread and leave the naked put option open and take the loss?  Thanks for your feedback.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 11:14:23'] Personally, I would hold 400 long, and run the wheel on 100 shares so you start to feel the volatility of TSLA. Buy the 500 shares. Sell 1 CC OTM with a week to expire. If it gets assigned, Sell 1 P ~5-10% less and see if you can buy those share back in a week. You’ll be collecting premiums the whole time, but you’ll realize how quickly TSLA changes from one week to the next. I have been *attempting* this same strategy for about a year. I’m really glad I only use 1-2 contracts at a time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 11:56:22'] This dude states the days of 5% move are gone and then TSLA today runs 3.3%. Quick say it again!

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 16:31:15'] To protect against large declines or climbs, I would only buy 400 shares so you have liquidity to roll over your contracts if needed.  Avoid being exercised. Otherwise, I would start with a CSP and fly at it. Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 01:14:03'] Your option lost theta and a lot of vega.  Check IV when you bought and IV now. IV is price the market gives for the stock movement chance. So even if the stock when down, if the IV was high when you bought it means it was priced in the option price.When you buy that put option you don't bet the stock will go down. You bet the stock will go down more or faster (so higher volatility) than the market prices it in. Stop option traiding until you study the greeks. There are combined option trades (spreads) that can change your trade to be focused on delta, vega, etc. For example you could have bought a put and sold a farther otm put to be more vega neutral.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 02:37:15'] Forget about calling it "theta decay" or "IV crush". Neither term will help you understand what happened.The put was simply overpriced when you bought it because too many wanted to own it in large quantities. Now, not as many want to own in those quantities and they are selling it. The price inevitably goes down when this happens. Each contract has it's own marketplace, which is related but also separate from the market for the underlying asset and the other options.How do you know it was overpriced in the first place? If you knew, you would sell it instead and make money, right? If you knew consistently which contracts are mispriced over or under, you would be a billionaire option trader. But you don't, and no one in this forum knows a certain option is overpriced or underpriced, so do not listen to whoever tells you they know this as a fact.Study.

Can you sell that option contract for a profit before it expires? Would a shareholder want your Right-to-Sell 100 shares at €200+more than you already paid per share/contract?I am a newbie investor but have seen pretty good month-to-day returns by simplifying the thought process. The math is FAR greater than what I can explain fully.Edit: Extrinsic value is "How much it is worth now." Intrinsic is "How much will it be worth later" Once you figure out the greeks, you'll be happier with your later positions

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 06:26:43'] IV crush and theta my friend
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-20 09:55:11'] An option's cash value equals its Extrinsic Value + Intrinsic ValueIntrinsic Value = Current share price - Strike Price for Calls or Strike Price - Current Share Price for Puts.So your 10/21/2022 200p has an intrinsic value equal to -8.xx as I am writing this. so you would need Tesla to move down at least to 200 if you are to get anything from intrinsic value and you would need to have it move down past 200 by at least the amount that you paid for it. I.e if you paid $1 you would need tesla to move to 199 before you start profiting from intrinsic value.Extrinsic value is the time value within the option and it decays to 0 as you get closer to expiration based off of the greeks. Since this option expires 10/21/2022 you have only 1.36 worth of time value at time of writing of extrinsic value. IF you paid less than $1 for the option you would be profitable right now, but if you paid more than $1 you would be in the red because intrinsic = 0 and there is only 1.36 extrinsic value.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 05:11:22'] I’m a long term share holder since 2017. Have a 2016 Model S. This is my third 50% dip.  2017-2019, 2020, 2022. I think Macro plays a huge part. TSLA is down 25% this 3 months, and flat the last year. QQQ is down 16% and 14%AMZN is down 31% and 36%FB is down 12% and 45%There’s a lot of news about Elon this and Elon that.  It’s is 90% noise. I ignore it and focus on the fundamentals. Negative catalysts. Tesla Shanghai was shut down for 1.5 months. This will hurt Q2 financials. It’s Teslas highest margin plant. Also the Fed will announce there is a recession on July 28th.  More Elon news will come out. Positive catalystsEvery automaker will sell every EV they make.  Tesla is planning on making the most and have a 1 year backlog on the model Y. I wish the news about Elon would have reduced my wait times it has not. My Feb order planned for Aug has been delayed to November. The delivery reports for tesla are planned for Jan 3rd, Apr 3rd, July 3rd, Oct 3rd.  So Jul 3rd will not be great.  I expect October to be good and Jan to be off the charts with Texas and Berlin to be ramped to 5k per week.  Also Tesla is announcing split. My own strategy which is not financial advice. Wait for them to announce the recession on Jul 28. The Q2 financials and Q2 earnings have past. And then mid August buy calls.  I bought calls last year in June and rode the Q3 and Q4 deliveries and dumped them 800C 6/22. 80k calls sold for 400k. It was pretty sweet. When TSLA doubled the calls 5x. Of course this is gambling. And the majority of my holdings are in the stock which is investing. Short term PE is compressing. Long term EPS Cars*ASP 50k, 20% margins:2020 ~0 EPS (500k cars built)2021 $6 (930k)2022 $15 (1.5M: 600k, 800k, 50k, 50k)2023 $25 (2.5M: 600k, 1M, 450k, 450k)2024 $36 (3.6M: 600k, 1M, 1M, 1M)These estimates are just based on the current factories. In 2024 Shanghai 2, Texas 2 and Berlin 2 Maybe producing cars. Shanghai they bought a second piece of land.  Texas and Berlin have room to expand. 40 PE 2023 = $1000, 40 PE 2024 is $1440. Or use your own PE.  Happy hunting

Are you going to roll the calls up? If rolling the calls up is the answer, have u given thoughts on how exactly you are going to do it?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 16:51:17'] Hi. I'm starting to trade SPX and I have some questions to determine my strike prices. Is there any good resource to review historical SPX volatility and major changes over time? I want to determine how likely certain movements might be based on history (ie, how likely is it to change 50, 100, 200, pts over a certain time frame, like a month or whatnot.)VIX is not helpful for what I'm looking for because it give current volatility and some of the websites I've seen just give historical numbers without the specific I'm looking for - ie, change amount over time period.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 13:14:45'] When it comes to option selling, why not do weeklies instead of monthlies? Usually it seems like the weeklies some at the same strike, when cumulatively added together, end up being more than the monthly. and if it's far OTM, that gives you time to push the strike further out on a covered call and/or collect higher premium. The weeklies seem better if you're bullish no?

If i bought an OTM put from regular stocks I would earn 800%+ with a drop like that, in this case I barely make 200% if it ends up itmMaybe I'm reading it wrong? Or is the IV just so high it's impossible to short via puts and I need to write callsEdit: Wow even credit call spreads are nigh impossible to make any sane level of risk/reward profit. This ticker is cursed. Dont touch it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:55:05'] Wheel strategy for bull market As far as I could understand Wheel should start with CSP to acquire shares on lower prices and then do the CC thing.

Perhaps the premiums are better comparing to CSPs premiums?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 06:56:55'] Need advice on how to think about LEAPS, since first time buying them. I bought SoFi $10 leaps expiring Jan 2024 for 17cents each. With the stock popping up the value of options has gone up a lot. With time decay involved I am not sure if I should sell for profit or wait. Is there an ideal period before expiration when you should sell to avoid time value decay? Am I even thinking about this right? Uncertainty in banking and financial sector is the only reason to consider selling, or I would hold until November and then decide.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 10:26:14'] What's the point (pros & cons) for trading options on futures VS. futures itself?&#x200B;\*\*All product below refers to /MES.    Small account here and got tired of the PDT rules trading SPX butterflies, so I started looking into futures and options on futures. After reading a bit, I have a couple questions regarding the topics.    I get futures are settled daily, but if I choose to hold a position overnight and there's an adverse price action, is margin requirement calculated in real-time? If so, will the margin call be issued by the broker while I'm asleep?    Liquidity between /ES vs /MES? Liquidity between options on /ES vs /MES?        Assume entering 1 x MESM3 at 4300, at expiration it settles at 4400, profit will be (4400- 4300) \* 5 - commission ($0.62) = $499.38. In comparison to the same day expiration option, on Jun 16, /MES 4300 call that cost $7, profit will be (4400 - 4300 - 7) \* 5 - commission ($1.82) = $463.18.    Why would I trade options rather than the futures itself, since the options payout is less, given the higher commission? Pros I can think is that the option will not be marked to market overnight compared to holding the contract itself; margin requirement might be lower for the option.        Please correct me if I'm wrong and thank you for any input. Currently trading in paper account to get a feel about this before dipping into real money.

It was not a display error, my maintenance margin did not increase. It's telling me the same about selling a SPY put.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 10:53:59'] is this a stupid idea and should I just close my TGT IC and take the $638 loss?[SCREENSHOT](https://ibb.co/mJJnydh)I am thinking of rolling the ITM short to 99 DTE, I still believe that TGT can at least touch around the 140 mark by then.Is this a reasonable strategy to turn my current $638 IC loss into a breakeven or even a win? The analysis tool shows that if TGT is at $119 by expiration, I will be pretty much in the same loss that I am now. But I really doubt that TGT will stay at such low, even if it hits it, it will have over 90 days to bounce back.Am I putting too much risk with this and should I take in the losses and close my IC before it expires next friday?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 22:49:44'] I don't know why I can't grasp this concept: Hypothetically, let's say a stock is up 500%. Looking at the option chain, every expiry has an IV of over 200%.Now let's say I want to play the mean reversion by buying puts 2-3 months out because I want to buy time, even though I have a gut feeling the stock that's up 500% right now will likely be down 50% next week.So, I buy puts with 200% IV 2-3 months out. Assuming the stock does happen to drop 50% next week, do these contracts still experience IV burn? Would these contracts lose money regardless of how far the puts are now ITM because the IV is so high? I'm trying to determine if I start buying puts on a couple of names 2-3 months out, but the IV is ridiculously high right now.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-09 03:14:51'] Question on pin risk!I am looking into vertical call debit spreads as a way to mitigate risk from buying calls at the expense of profit. I have learned about pin risk and wanted to make sure I am understanding the risks well to make sure I do not blow my account up.My understanding is that pin risk would come into play if I hold the spread til expiration and the short (sold) call is assigned. Prior to me being chosen for the assignment risk my long (bought) call expires worthless, and the stock price is very high requiring me to buy 100 shares at X$ above the strike price.In theory I can mitigate this by never holding to expiration. Even if assigned prior to expiration I will have the long (bought) call to act as a buffer. Though it sounds this can be a false sense of security if the spread is held over the weekend and the assignment occurs after hours, and some news comes out that has a negative effect of on the stock price and thus my long (bought) call? It sounds like this risk would still be limited though.As another hedge, I shouldn't trade spreads on any stock where I can't afford the value (100 shares x the # of options) of my short (sold) call.Most of the videos I have watched on this topic seem to be concerned with put credit spreads which makes sense as, if assigned, you'd need to owe the money required for 100 shares at the strike price. Though the risk is still there if the long expires worthless, short is exercised, and stock price goes up dramatically (e.g., Nvidia during earnings)Thank you in advance for any help and knowledge

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-14 13:20:45'] You are betting against a company with 50% YoY growth, net profit in billions and completely obliterating the car industry. If you are going to bet against a company like that you need a solid fundamental framework to justify that kind of short position. I plan on betting for TSLA with options given Biden's TSLA Shareholder Enrichment Act is coming out next year.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 17:29:38'] Hey all, just had a question. This morning I purchased a 6/9 41$ Al call and is sitting at 93% gains at market close. Obviously it's probably advisable to take profit at this point however I am okay with risking this profit I've made if there is reasonable potential for significantly more. If I hold it through earnings and the stock pumps, will I make significantly more gains? I'm new to this and not sure how IV crush and theta decay will affect me.I know this whole play is I advised and I understand I'm essentially gambling/playing with money. Thanks
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-31 16:01:10'] I'd really appreciate if someone can help me figure out wtf is going on with my puts. I'm holding SPY $300 puts expiring in January. Stupid, I know. Anyways...The contract closed yesterday at $2.95 per share and it closed at the exact same price today. After hours right now, the bid is showing $2.98 but that's not much of a difference anyway.So SPY went down about a half percent today while the VIX went up nearly 3%. So how in the ever loving fuck did my puts remain practically unchanged?!?!Theta is about -0.026 so I should lose less than 3 cents per share to time decay. Let's just round it up and say 3 cents. Okay, but delta is about -0.062, which if I understand correctly means my contracts should have risen in value by more than 6 cents per dollar that SPY went down. SPY is down 2.33 on the day. Let's round down and say an even 2 bucks down. Which means at a bear minimum my contracts should have closed at least 12 cents higher than yesterday, minus the 3 cents it lost to theta. So the puts should have easily closed at least 9 cents higher than yesterday, or $3.04. Probably even more than $3.04 though, because notice how I rounded off all the numbers in a disadvantageous direction. Yet even now the bid is $2.98. I feel like the market maker is literally trying to rob me. What am I missing? How am I misunderstanding this?Please and thank you.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 17:12:32'] Question about buying powerHey folks. I’m just discovering that the amount of buying power needed for certain plays is wildly different. For example if i am selling a put- on some underlyings’ the amount is the full amount required to cover- like a csp. On some it is a fraction. I can sell a 30 put on AI for only -315 in buying power! If I sell a 14 on PLTR it’s the full value of the risk. Even more interesting is that it’s different on differing platforms. TOS is reducing my Bp way more than TT’s. Can some one explain the differences? Is there a way to know without clicking into actual contracts and seeing what the amount will be?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 16:22:36'] I've been deep value investing for around 2 years now, and i'm looking to implement some LEAPs into my portfolio. I like the potential for big upside with limited downside it presents but I never know whether i'm getting a good price or not. For example, i'm looking at PACW call LEAPs expiring Jan 2025 at 15 strike. The ask is $1.70. How do I know i'm not overpaying? Usually, i just look at the IVRank (I use tastytrade) and if its under 50, I feel like it's reasonably priced, but there's got to be a better way.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 22:14:36'] Options in simpler terms: did I get it right?The price of an Options contract (i.e., premium) at any given point in time has two components = Intrinsic value + Extrinsic value.Intrinsic value is the measure of how much profitness that contract is sitting on at that point in time (based on the strike rate and the underlying stock price). Hence the terms - In the Money (ITM), At the Money (ATM), Out of the Money (OTM) etc.Extrinsic value is the measure of uncertainty surrounding the possible fluctuations of the Intrinsic value depending on the remaining days to expire. Hence, more days to expiry means more chances for the underlying stock price to go up or down. Thereby, higher price for that contract. So, as an Options contract nears expiry, the extrinsic value component lowers since not much time left to have price fluctuation in the underlying stock. And if the contract is already in OTM, then it'll be worthless on the expiration date.Did I get it right?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 08:54:47'] I'm selling an ITM $27.5 call exp 7/21 on UBER. As of this post, the price of the option is tracking the current price of the stock closer than usual. As an example, let's say UBER is going for $37.50 per share, my call option is priced at 10.00  over 45 days out. Typically, I don't see this happening until I'm less than 30 days out. Any insights to why this is happening? Does this mean there's low demand for the option and, as a seller, I'm in good shape? Or am I wasting my time and should close out my position?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 10:24:06'] Still learning options and have 2 questions: 1. What’s the max loss you can get for option trading? I read from Investopedia that the max loss is the premium. But I’ve seen people posting 500k loss in other subs. Does that mean he bought 500k premium and the contracts expired OTM?2. Let’s say I don’t have any AAPL share. Now I bought one call from person A, and then sold it to person B. If B exercised the contract, do I need to buy 100 shares of AAPL to person B? Or the broker platform is smart enough to trace the 100 shares back to person A (or the original call seller that A bought them from?)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 13:39:27'] Thinking of adjusting my June 16 put credit spread in Tesla. Sold the 165 bought the 160. Only like 20 dollars extrinsic value left here. I can adjust up to the 180/175 and get about .50 credit. Two questions- when I do this, does that “lock in” the full profit of my original credit spread?  I.e. is the additional $.50 premium is on top of the entire premium I received for the first spread?  Second- what sort of risk/reward should I be considering?  The 180 put is a 17 delta so high probability trade, but I’m risking 450 to make an extra 50, which doesn’t seem that great .(Not counting the previous premium, of course)

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-01 01:15:45'] If I have a bull call spread, and the stock price increases above the strike price of the short call before expiration (for example, 7 days till expiration), I understand that the profits I make will not be the max profit, as I would need to hold till near expiration before closing the spread to realize the max profits.However, if I were to hold the spread with the short call ITM for the 7 remaining days, is there the possibility for the ITM short call to be assigned, and needing to sell 100 shares at strike price?

What's the likelyhood the option buyer exercises sooner than later? I am watching the OI on them daily now and is staying the same...so far.Also, if my Unrealized P&L on the calls succeed the cost basis I sold them for, I would think the option buyer becomes interested.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-02 07:10:04'] Noobie question about brokers:I've been pouring over the FAQ and various broker discussions, but I'm still a bit in the weeds. I'm based in Europe and I'm on the hunt for a brokerage that allows trading options on US equities, like AAPL. From what I've gathered online, InteractiveBrokers does offer this, but it seems like you might need around 100k to comfortably trade options there. I'm not entirely sure, but that's the figure that keeps popping up, which is a bit more than what I'm able to work with.  I looked into DEGIRO too, but they only provide trading in US index options, not equity ones.  So, does anyone know a broker that's more suited to someone with a smaller liquid fund but still lets you trade US equity options?

I’ve seen this with other options that went NS that during a restructure and have been caught out with no volume NS options that no one wants.  If the spread is $0-50, would I be able to call broker or the market just needs to act?

However one trend I'm noticing is the necessity of keeping an eye on the trades?My dumb question is, can you legitimately buy / sell some form of options without the need to keep an eye on the market during the day? I work a regular 8-5 type of job and can't really keep an eye on calls or spreads to quickly close them if the market starts to swing the wrong direction. **So what do people do who have normal jobs that consume their attention but want to trade options?**

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 14:29:51'] Do long dated calls almost always go red before they go green? Im looking at paypal, for example.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-03 15:18:18'] Apologies in advance for the dumb question. What happens if your option is assigned but you don’t have enough funds to complete the transaction. i.e. purchased 1 call option contract in the QQQ @ strike 350 with a protective sell @ 359. The market closes @ 354.  Does the broker buy the shares for the position @ 350 and then sells at the current market price giving back the profits? Or does the broker demand funds be deposited to purchase the shares? Again apologies if this is in the literature above, or if it has been answered in the past. I skimmed the literature but it doesn’t touch the possibility of the trader not having enough funds to complete the transaction.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 09:13:27'] Hi, I tried to open a thread but have low karma or I'm too new.    I am trying to come up with an option's strategy. It's pretty specific..I want to be long AAPL for the 16th June. I'd like it to pay well at 185-190. The tricky part (for me)- I don't want the loss to exceed 20% anywhere above an underlying price of 170 during the first week, including if volatiltiy increases (over time or from a spike).    I came up with this:    Sell:    230x 160Put    15x 185Call    Buy:    150x 165Put    15x 185Call    30x 190Call    It isn't long volatility. The rest fits. Is there a better way?    Thank you for any help! Matt
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 10:24:20'] I want to get my hands on Darvas Box strategy with option paper trading. What bugs me, is how chart analysis generally translates to option trading. For example with Darvas, a stop loss barrier is formed at a certain stock price and if the stock price crossed this barrier, the option price lost value unproportionally.    Usually a risk per trade is set to 1-3% and take profit ratio is 1.5. How does this translate to Options when evalutating price action e.g. in TradingView?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 15:00:44'] Colour me intrigued. I had been considering indicators as mostly "accurate for short-term only" at best or "overthinking to death"... In general you want to create/respect signals for which you can enter for long or sell/short-sell. But what about for credit spreads? Credit spreads don't mature/pop as quickly as a single long option. At what point do you TA-ers enter credit spreads, and at what point do you exit? I was thinking if you want to see TA, you can see the signal if the day is likely bullish/bearish, to then sell a credit spread at 5-10delta. You either would keep to your conviction, or sell at a certain stop gap based on the indicators of your choice. I just cannot imagine the latter being that profitable given how these indicators like MACD, VWAP cross over multiple times in a day for credit spreads and other theta play.ETA:Ex: Had I opened 1 x 400c NVDA on Friday open because a certain pattern indicates bullish day, I would have probably made 30% for the first 5 minutes, until I see the MACD reverses and SMA/VWAP swaps (common signal for reversal).On the other hand, had I sold 1x 395/-400c for let's say 1:1 risk/reward 250 credit, then this probably would have barely made $20 around the same time frame because the short leg would have still carried some theta/extrinsics. I suppose you could have opened 1000 of 395/-400c respecting stop loss/stop price, so that you would still acquire respectable profits... but let me hear from you!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 16:10:28'] A. How are options priced? In terms of striking a balance of presenting a benefit to both the seller and the buyer?

What is the logic to taking that approach?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-04 18:56:54'] Hypothetically, if I I had the foresight to predict a stock would move over 100% within the next 30 days, but the IV is already high (over 100%), does it make sense to buy option contracts closer to ITM or at a price that's more OTM (i.e., at a strike that's 50%, 75%, 100% higher than the current underlying).I know how stupid this question sounds, but if I 'knew' with certainty the stock was going to move 100%, doesn't it make sense to buy at the higher strike?Edit: I guess what I'm trying to determine is whether or not it's even worth buying options when the IV is already high, either slightly OTM or far, far OTM, or just buying the equity--even if I had 100% foresight.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 09:46:30'] Those moonshots like TSLA Q3 earnings are a bane to call sellers.  Without seeing your trade by trade, my guess is that your strategy started to fail you last October when TLSA broke 900 and ran.  Call sellers want just enough ups and downs to generate a little volatility, but no massive runups like that (once you have your position established).  The only way around that is to pick more boring stocks, or indexes.

I have a set amount of capital that I will buy and sell shares with (by selling puts and covered calls). I made about 75k doing this almost exclusively with Tesla last year. I have definitely out performed the market but at the same time, my buy and hold shares have made me the most money over the past 4-5 years. The benefit of doing this is it gives you capital back which you can distribute how you see fit.

Selling options and/or running a wheel style strategy is NOT a max profit strategy.  It's a cashflow strategy that aims to generate a more consistent (but often lower) return than a straight buy and hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 14:44:37'] You’re not guaranteed to make money selling covered calls. You are establishing a short vol position and if you continue to roll, you incur losses relative to just holding stock if vol outperforms. You’ll tend to lose even if the stock rallies a lot, which people think is “good” for the strategy - It’s not.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 16:17:24'] the hard pill to swallow for most people practice wheel like strategies is that they just don't work. people think they've discovered some sort of infinite money glitch where you sell calls and use the calls to buy more shares. it only works if you are lucky enough to do it in very specific sideways markets. TSLA is an extremely volatile stock and isn't a good candidate for this.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 21:02:23'] I only sell really really otm weeklies. Its tempting for those higher premiums but i like to avoid those taxable events in selling the shares. (yes i know the premiums are taxable). i just look at the premiums a nice divy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 07:45:09'] You’re selling vol on one of the most volatile stocks, so yes that is likely to kneecap some gains. Maybe reduce your notional TSLA exposure, and buy vol (i.e. calls as close as you can afford out 3-6mos).  This is the last thing that I would sell puts on. Not a subtle mover, so you can get assigned quickly. Sure selling 10 of the $700s this AM would get you $15k. Get assigned and it barely makes a dent in the $700,000 you would need to post.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 08:54:57'] Sounds like you got the expected result. Option wheeling is an income strategy, it’s not intended to beat buy and hold and generally won’t over the long term. What can you do to improve your strategy? If you don’t need the income, just buy and hold.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-22 11:40:55'] You need to seriously look at your return and not what could have been. Selling CC on anything is a strategy and your original goal was to profit from it. You pick the company/target/strike/size and hope it stays above your entry point in order to collect the premiums each week/month, etc. It matters not what the ticker symbol is, just the return. You also have to manage your entries, in that you don't buy on tops and sell ATM calls on those entries, only to deal with the lows and scrambling to sell  premium that is way OTM with little gains, only to see the stock move back again and then seeing red on your sold options.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-24 20:31:00'] I think you are missing one thing. Comparing selling options to just owning the stock is an unfair comparison unless you are also quantifying the amount of risk you are taking on in options vs the amount of risk in the stock. If your overall risk was significantly lower in the options then it could be that you actually did better than the stock
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 10:49:21'] Maybe you can pair your covered calls with a super far OTM call (basically a super fat bear call spread- like a 15-20% spread or something). If Tesla starts having those monster runups, you leg out of your short call and let the long call run.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-21 23:50:00'] If by selling cc and it goes itm a lot of times then you are not predicting the price properly. So the purpose is you’re not buying the stock just to then cap gains.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 16:53:53'] Hi all,I have been listening to a podcast that gave a study for winning spy call options about 70% of the time. The strategy is to wait for VXX to go above then drop back below its 10 day moving average. Once it drops below buy a call option for SPY about 30 days out with a delta around .5.When looking at charts if I'm looking at weekly, VXX just dropped below its 10 day moving average while 1 month it's just above and 3 months it's about to cross above. Which chart do you think is the best one to use here?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-23 21:00:19'] Sorry for the basic question. I understand how covered calls work, and understand that you can "buy to close" as one way to close the position as opposed to leting it expire worthless if its OTM/let it be exercised if ITM and let the shares go.My question is, does that mean you physically buy a contract at the strike/exp that you sold initially? And then can you then turn around and "sell to close" the contract?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-24 12:32:13'] I have a losing IC in PYPL expiring in 23 days.I follow tastytrade's methodology so according to it I would be rolling the IC into the next month whereby I will move down the untested side ( the short vertical call) because the price went down against my position.The rolling has to be done entirely for a credit, which is fine when rolling the untested side, however when I go to roll the tested side without changing the strikes, it won't let me do it for credit, only a debit.But if I were to adjust the strikes on the tested side and go a couple of strikes lower, then I can do it for a small credit. My question is, is it more profit-efficient to adjust the strikes on both sides so they fit the new IVx of the expiration cycle?I am asking because according to guidelines I have watched on tasty, when managing losing trades they only change the strikes of the untested side.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 04:31:38'] Hey guys, I need to defend two Iron condors; QQQ 350 short call and MSFT 327,5 short call. QQQ: Rolling the put up to create in Iron butterfly grants a good premium (since qqq is just at the short leg) so I think I will be doing this. MSFT: Creating an Iron butterly doesnt cut it (because msft is already almost at the long call at 335). I was thinking about rolling the put side up to create a short box spread. This would grant a very good premium. This would lock in the max (750 per contract - call und put spreads premium). Would be a smaller loss than selling the call spread now.obviously I should have closed the positions earlier which was my mistake. Any thoughts on the defensive adjustments?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 05:33:16'] Quick question about earnings vol expansion: right before earnings, we know the vol on options expiring close to the the earnings date will have elevated vol. B/c of put-call parity, the expected move of the underlying shouldn't be a huge factor in the options price.Now suppose earnings happened, and the price of the underlying dumps. The vol stays elevated a few days after. In theory, b/c of vega, the price of calls is elevated (but offset by the underlying price decrease). **If you were looking to buy longer dated calls, how would you approach this? Would you wait a few days for vol to crush? Or would it not matter since the longer DTE, the less effect of earnings on the implied vol?**

If I were to close the option position now, I would incur close to 1k loss nett as it is high volatility now. Just like to ask for advice if I should hold on to it to expiry or close off the option position (incurring a loss on the option position but having a chance to capital gain/breakeven upon sale of the underlying)?I was thinking if I hold till expiry, the trade price might fall and I will then need to hold on the stock and not be able to free up capital.This stock has good fundamentals but I was assigned at a high price about a year back due to a cash secured out position which I have since learned on my mistake across the past year. However I did not expect the stock to go up 25% across the last 3 weeks.No bashing please. Still learning. Thank you.

Market capitalization can be affected by bonds being converted to shares.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 09:06:58'] > I'd like to bet on a specific pair of stocks with no connection on their real value. Who says there is no connection on their value? According to the price history of their shares, there is 0.44 positive correlation. Not super large, to be sure, but not zero either.[Correlation of TSLA vs RIVN.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/asset-correlations?s=y&symbols=TSLA+RIVN&timePeriod=2&tradingDays=60&months=36)Betting on a **market cap** ratio would be hard. It's easier to bet on price ratios. If you can assume that the public float will stay constant for both, price is a perfect proxy anyway.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-03 17:25:40'] There's literally 1000 ways to play this. As far as some set strategy there is no way to directly profit from the caps merging. The point is to employ proper strategies to capitalize on this particular movement you think the stocks will make. This can be as simple as buying puts on TSLA if you think it's going down, or selling spreads if you think it is trading flat while RIVN catches up. Then on the other side you should be employing bullish strategies on RIVN as you see fit with market condition. Just because you think this ratio will come to be does not determine how the market will make this ratio happen. You just have to keep a clear mind and recognize better money moves when they are there and protect it when needed.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 10:23:19'] You could do a pairs trade maybe? This is where have a long position (real or synthetic) in one stock, and a short in the other. Here's how it could work.Let's assume that ABC and XYZ have a strong correlation such that XYZ is usually $10 less than ABC. And right now, the stocks are only $X apart, where X is some number other than 10. To profit here, you would go long on one symbol and go short on the other. Your expectation is that at some point, *relative to each other*, one will gain value and the other will lose value. It doesn't really matter what their current prices are, or even what their prices will end up being in the future, as long as the stocks *trend towards* that $10 difference.Let's use actual numbers to illustrate:Scenario 1: ABC now is $100. XYZ is now $97. Go long ABC, short XYZ.* Scenario 1-A: ABC later is at 130. XYZ is at 120. Your long stock has gained $30. The short stock has lost $23. Total profit is $7.* Scenario 1-B: ABC is later at $80. XYZ is at $70. Long stock in ABC has lost you $20. Short stock in XYZ has gained you $27. Net gain is (again) $7.Scenario 2: ABC is currently at $100, XYZ is at $85. Now go long XYZ and short ABC.* Scenario 2-A: ABC laters goes to $120, XYZ to $110. ABC has lost you $20 and XYZ has gained $25. Net gain is $5.* Scenario 2-B: ABC later goes to $50, XYZ to $40. ABC has gained you $50, XYZ has lost you $45. Net gain is $5.The upside here is that this doesn't rely on a bear market or a bull market. Up, down, doesn't matter. All you care about is that correlation to correct the prices relative to each other.This gets a bit harder to apply when the relationship isn't a fixed dollar amount, but a ratio instead. You would need to change the amount of shares/contracts in one position or the other.tl;dr if you believe in the correlation and the correlation is currently out of alignment, short one side and long the other to profit off of the correction of that correlation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 10:29:55'] It’s called pairs trading. Obvious they are similar categories of stock, but make sure there is a significant correlation to each other, look at there beta, and historical comparison.At that point it’s relatively simple. It just a matter of how much equity you put in. 1:1 equity would be trading the relation the most, 2:1 would be more hedging ($1000:$1000, $2000:$1000).People who trade pairs mostly use futures because the capital efficient buying power compared to the leverage per dollar

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 02:27:56'] Hi everyone,I’ve decided on getting into options trading after months of familiarising myself with materials and online videos. I’ll be using Interactive Brokers and plan to day trade options on ETFs SPY and QQQ. I heard that for a short term trade such as day trading for ETFs, the expiration dates should be no more than 7 days as this is where option premiums aren’t as high as later expiration dates. Anyone here have successfully traded options with this limited time frame? And how much more riskier is this compared to a further out expiration date? Would you mind sharing your experiences / perimeters for your trade / options strategy that you used?Any advice or things to look out for will be much appreciated.Cheers!

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-11 10:06:12'] Ok, this is a stupid question. I just did my first option trade a few weeks ago really just to make sure I had the procedure down correctly. I made a spread selling a put on NVDA at 245 and buying a put at 220, both with the strike date of May 26. This gave me a net credit so I am hoping these will expire worthless and I can keep the premium. I plan on closing the trade, probably next week before the earnings report on May 24. I will close by buying back the 245 put. My question is what do I do with the 220 put I bought for insurance. Do I just sell it after I buy back the 245 put?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 05:41:13'] So I’m learning about covered calls and to me it seems like a free money generator. Someone please let me know where the secret risk is that I’m not seeing.Say I own 100 shares of SPY, which I want to continue holding. I write a covered call for them and if the market drops I keep the premium, if the market goes up but stays below strike I keep the premium as well as benefit from the increased value of the underlying, and if it passes the strike I take max profit. The market taking a downturn is obviously a risk but if I intend to own the SPY anyway and not sell during a downturn, I seem to take on no additional risk.As far as I understand it, pin risk is not applicable as I already have the shares in my account. If the option holder exercises after close, whatever my shares get called away and I just buy them back close to the strike. Additional money with no additional risk, what am I missing? TIA
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-12 07:51:15'] Hi, I trade shares normally and don't fully grasp options (as will be clear here in a moment). I was talked into a credit spread on AAPL earnings last week. long May 12 145c @ $21.13short May 12 143c @ $23.08for a net credit of $195. i tried to get 10 of these, only got filled on 2. so a credit of $390. I was under the impression I had a max loss of $5 per spread. This morning I was looking to short AAPL shares near open. My PNL and position size on AAPL were 0. When I entered suddenly i was short 200 more shares that I should have been and my PNL was -6000. I sort of freaked obviously, and after letting the stock dip a bit I flattened the position. filled at 173.20. Obviously I had been assigned the short side of the spread, something I wasn't aware was possible. So I checked the long calls, and they were hovering around $28, but AAPL was clearly headed down and I didn't want them to lose anymore, so i sold them got $5611 for them. After crunching all the numbers it appears I only lost $39, so i guess a cheap lesson. My question is really, what should I have done? If I hadn't traded apple and left those shares short, would the long calls of been assigned covering the short position and keeping my max loss the same? and having already covered that short position was I correct to get out of the long calls ASAP before they lost more value? Thanks.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-13 15:51:57'] I have been dabbling in stock trading for the last 3 years. Recently I have joined a student managed college fund that lets students invest with a 3 to 5 year holding period. After spending time there, I now know the signs on what good companies look like within the next 3 to 5 years.This brings me to options. Obviously, I'd like to start making returns sooner than 3 years, so I have started looking into options. I've watched a ton of youtube videos, but something I have noticed is that a **LOT** of people never explain **WHY** they made certain trades. They say "I thought SPY was going to go down and so I bought a PUT and made over $3,000 in a day" without ever explaining what it was that made them believe SPY was going down. These videos never actually explain the thinking behind why they believe something was going to happen. I get that tech ETFs are volatile and all, but what is the reasoning behind hourly or daily options? What are good signs, bad signs, or anything in between?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-15 13:10:22'] TD's banking app kept canceling a multi-leg trade I tried to place today. When I called them to ask about it, they told me that I couldn't place a limit order for the natural market price. Does that make any sense at all?Here's my example:SELL PYPL P 19 MAY 23 $70.00   BUY PYPL P 19 MAY 23 $72.50      MID: $2.50   NATURAL: $2.65LIMIT: $2.65 DEBITWhen I called, they told me the maximum valid limit order price was the difference between the strikes, even though the market was already trading higher (and..... pretty much always *would* before expiry?!). They recommended I put in a limit order for $2.50 instead, which naturally didn't get filled because it didn't take the bid-ask spreads into account. Am I crazy for thinking you should be able to place a limit order for any price "near" current market price?The app also showed a larger reduction in buying power (4k) than the trade price (~1k). That's incorrect too, right? The reduction in buying power should be the cost of the trade? It's essentially a debit spread even if it's the result of me unwinding a pretty unfortunate trade (which should eventually have increased my buying power, but for the system to tell me that seems to be a big ask by now)
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 10:20:59'] I bought a TUP $1 5/19 put about a month ago, and I'm confused why it hasn't risen in value as much as I expected. I bought it for $15 when the share price was $1.32, and it's currently only at $28 despite the share price being at under $0.80 currently. Delta is around 0.6, and theta is only about 0.006 so I wouldn't have expected it to be an issue with time decay or anything. I just thought it would have gained more money than it has, especially after being ITM now. Can anyone explain why it wouldn't have moved as much, even just from IV? I'm not sure whether I should sell it at this point or if it would actually start moving a bit more if it continues to go down (which I personally expect it to).

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 08:53:15'] Elon's ability to keep the hype train rolling is 2nd to none.  Take a look at what happened when Dr. Burry, the king of brass balls and short positions, announced his short position in $TSLA.  Dr. Burry lays out a very reasonable and encouraging message to Elon to issue shares and take profits to cement Tesla's existence.  He even used an email from Elon where he himself admits that the stock price is not based in real value.  In response Elon essentially jingled some keys by announcing a massive Bitcoin position.  I'm guessing he has dozens of such distractions ready to go since the entire existing electricity model can be improved by leaps and bounds.  Not to mention you can electrify new things like boats, ships, bikes, boards, flight, etc. Each of these would serve as fuel for the hype train.  Also there was the flame thrower...TLDR:  It's Dr. Burry's brass balls VS Elon's long shlong.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 09:55:39'] TSLA is the reason I don't hold much ARKK.This will get downvoted, but it's a bubble. Just look at the other comments in the thread, everyone knows the value is based on hype and not P/E or tangible returns. That's always been one of the defining features of a bubble.When it pops it will bring a lot down with it. I'm still not shorting it though as it could be propped up on hype ad infinitum.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:34:00'] Mustang Mach-e officially hit dealerships. 2021 Ford F-150 hybrid hit dealerships.While available inventory numbers are slim for the above, there’s still a difference between buying a car this quarter and putting a $100 refundable down payment on a 70k truck you’ve never even driven or seen in person nor have the slightest clue of expected delivery date.Just wanted to share some automotive insights. People are cancelling Ford bronco pre orders because they’re not coming in fast enough. Can’t count on any realistic estimates of sales based on those pre orders and truck shoppers are the most die hard brand loyal customers to begin with.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:56:09'] Bro close that lol. Tesla has been in a downtrend / consolidation for a while now. It's gearing up for the next leg up which would come any time now. It's not worth it. Make the same bet against XPEV who have less chance to randomly start going to the moon
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:35:28'] I shorted Tesla too.  The more I do my due diligence, I realize that Tesla is a great company, but that doesn't make it a great stock.  As an analogy, Cisco is a great company, but if you bought the stock in 1999-2000, you'd still be looking at 40% losses 20 years later, even though they control the enterprise networking space, and are the largest player in the SMB networking space.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:41:36'] I was in this camp prior to this year. I didn’t short Tesla but I never bought any. Increasing competition was my rationale as well but my tune has changed recently. China is the largest market and most worrisome for Tesla because I think NIO is showing promise. However, it takes a while to scale and technology is key to this industry. In the US there is no equal competition. BMW, Porsche, Audi future cars are all priced above $50k and some are north of $100k. Tesla dropping their prices make them more affordable for the masses. What also needs to be considered is the technology inside a Tesla as well as Elon’s future projects and how they will integrate with cars. Tesla will likely win the autonomous battle and first to market always wins.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:28:17'] I think this Texas situation might actually cause TSLA to pop again. People often forgot they make solar panels/home battery backups. I’ve seen quite a few social media posts of Tesla solar home owners chilling with their heat/lights on.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:50:39'] More power to you; it's risky, but I certainly understand and agree with most of your reasoning.  Tesla, just like Bitcoin, is mania.  No reasoning or sound logic, as gained by a hundred years of history - but pure 'this will only go up forever' stupidity.  I see Tesla at $400 by next January - and it would still be highly over-valued.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:01:32'] They are always cutting costs of vehicles. This is nothing new. Tesla mission is to get everyone driving electric, so they cut costs while retaining margins.Oh, and the competition has been coming for the last 10 years https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303653004579210053345661982

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:02:47'] You mention competition but then cite the Audi e-Tron... Surprisingly little of TESLA's valuation has anything to do with the sale of cars. If you see a new player in the robotaxi/automated driving/energy space I could see it majorly affecting TESLA's share price, but in the areas that tesla really shines, they dont have much competition.Billions were lost by TESLA shorts for making the mistake of seeing TESLA's value as a car company instead of a technology company. At least you had the presence of mind to cap your max loss with a spread.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:05:59'] One thing I learned from shorting NFLX back in 2015 is that competition was way slower than I expected (even for something with essentially zero barriers to entry). I would wait until I see strong competition and growing market share from competitors first and then short.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:17:42'] I had tesla shorts on this past week. Already was a good callIn my case I bought volatility rather than sell it for Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:19:57'] Interesting take on the price cut. Many would argue that the price cut could actually be a good news to Tesla as it would almost guarantee to increase market share, and the price cut could also result from a drop in manufacture cost, so in the end the margin probably would drop as much.

And that marked the top for the stock.Investors pushed the stock down on the news, and shares sold off by more than 5%.Tesla saw an incredible gain of over 740% in 2020. So, the earnings miss showed investors signs of weakness ahead for the company — and helped kick off the pullback we’ve seen in the stock.But I’ve tracked the stock since 2006. And I knew these past few weeks would be volatile.Now that the stock has dipped 14% from its peak, it’s time for us to jump in and buy call options.Tesla’s stock has dropped on earnings seven times since 2006. On each occasion, the stock has bounced back. That’s a 100% win rate.We’ll take advantage of the expected rebound by adding the April 16, 2021 $790 call option"

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:19:56'] Good luck but I can’t believe this is the trade you decided to make out of all of the possible ones. Tesla could see a correction in the short term due to the China regulatory inquiry, but if you’re not extremely bullish on them in the long term you’re missing the plot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:24:40'] None of those reasons matter in a delusional market - good luck. I would focus more on negative news coming out of China than anything. Mike Burry seems to think them buying Bitcoin is just to distract from their China woes.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:58:54'] Here's the thing (hear me out) -- Tesla is not a car company. Yes, it is ostensibly a car company, but it's value is in its *BRAND*. If not for that, it's a clear and obvious short. But soon it will be more than a car company. IMHO, before long it will be the next Apple--  Heat pumps for the auto industry and homes, thermostats, car chargers, solar panels, "smart" home tech, "smart" car tech... All Tesla branded. Disclosure: I have no positions at all in TSLA. Zero. I sold all my stock months ago and have been trying to figure out what everyone else sees but I didn't. This is the absolute best case I can come up with.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:54:49'] Lol that's like saying the iPhone has increasing competition.

Just like how there's so many Androids out there on the market, they will never be an iPhone.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 09:35:01'] First of all, Tesla isn't an automobile company, it's an electronic company that sells battery packs , solar panels and also carsAlso people don't view Tesla stock as a 1:1 ratio compared to the company value or profit, people view tesla way more weighted towards future gains since Tesla reinvest alot of its profits towards future growthAlot of people have bet against Elon and thus far unsuccessfully.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:39:33'] I'm not saying Tesla's valuation is realistic whatsoever, but I don't think competition is such a bad thing like Tesla bears seem to always think.There's a reason Elon has always made Tesla patents public, he's always wanted more competition and market attention in the EV space. Tesla has (and imo always will be) the upper-class, luxury EV with advanced tech. I don't think competition from vehicles like the Nissan Leaf or even the Audi e-Tron (which is totally sick) will undercut Tesla's market share. Essentially, the Venn diagram of Tesla consumers and Chevy Bolt consumers is 2 circles. More people buying EVs will always mean more Tesla owners (and more EV subsidies), no matter how you spin it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:39:08'] You’re not betting against Elon you’re betting against an unjustifiable valuation. What I think the Tesla cultists are missing here is that most people shorting Tesla don’t think it’s a bad company or don’t believe in Elon, it’s just at an unsustainable and stupid price for the company. Even Elon has said this, wake up people!I would implore all of you to look at what happened to Microsoft and Amazon during the dotcom bubble. Tesla stock has been on a run for just a year now stop acting like it’s price is a law of nature. A lot of you haven’t done your stock market history homework and are new to this, it shows.

Also selling call credit spreads is not shorting the stock. Thinking that that is shorting the stock makes me believe you may be new to this and think that TSLA stock will follow some sort of logic, which it doesn’t. Cathie Wood and ARKK just significantly increased their TSLA position and I bet they know more than you. Many very smart, very experienced traders have been wrecked trying to bet against TSLA based on logical reasons.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 10:50:26'] Godspeed man. Let us know how it comes out. The E-tron does look amazing but the range estimates is sort of bleak. Porsche is doing a decent one too. I personally can’t wait until Mazda and Subaru jump on board. An electric Mazdaspeed3 or an electric WRX? I’m in.

It's a bubble and it will pop. I'm sure it'll have a slight pop, but do you really think it'll come crashing down? I'm of the opinion that investing in tesla is about tesla AND about investing in Elon. And that guy can't be stopped. I don't have any tesla shares just my meager opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 11:42:00'] I own GM stock. I was comparing their market cap and vehicle production to that of Tesla’s. I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me, but GM roughly produces 10 times more vehicles then Tesla, yet its market cap is roughly 1/10th of Tesla’s.  So if you put that in perspective of vehicles produced, Tesla’s market cap per vehicle produced is 100 times higher than GM. Crazy. I certainly do think that Tesla should be valued higher than GM. But by 100 times? I don’t think so. So I’m bullish on GM, as they pivot heavier towards EV, and bearish on Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:39:10'] Why do I get the feeling the second this person buys a put the market will rally 5% in a single day.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 10:15:17'] If you are new to options, don't just buy a put option - buy a spread. If you buy a single put option with 815 strike, that option will cost you $59.90 right now so your break even is that you need Tesla under $755 to make money. If you buy a single option, you want to be directionally certain of the direction of the move. Instead - do a spread to lower your risk. Buy the 815 strike Put (costs $60) // Sell the 750 strike (pays $34.50) for $25.55 net debit and max profit of $49.45 per contract if Tesla drops to $750 or lower. Of course, if you REALLY know that Tesla is going to drop, then go right ahead and buy the single Put option at full price and ignore the spread. But if really knew that Tesla was going one direction or another you would not be new to options and you be minted already. So take the safer bet - the put spread. Way cheaper if you are wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 09:16:13'] If you have enough money to buy tesla puts, you can also get QQQ puts, Nasdaq, for a fraction of the price. Seems to me a safer option.September QQQ puts at 300 strike seems like a good idea to me.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:01:37'] OP had better get the timing right. Sometimes TSLA rips $100 for no reason.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:09:59'] Tesla is extremely volatile and can gain or lose $100 in a day. Often seen it swing 50 one way then 50 the other ie drop 50 then recover or spike $50 and lose it. Tesla puts are the worst kind of gambling
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 09:47:14'] I'm a TSLA bull so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've been selling puts to people like you for over 2 years now and I've made over 300k on them. The market may be going bearish but I wouldn't still bet long term against TSLA at the moment. Just do QQQ or SPY puts

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 12:51:33'] The whole tech market is selling off on a massive downtrend forming on many indicators, if someone here is dissuading you from buying puts, they are not good at this. TSLA is a good choice (there are extrinsic factors supporting ifs over-valuation as well), go a bit further  OTM and further out on the date, more than a month out. The premiums and TSLA’s big movements will net you good gains on a smaller buy, you’ll basically just have to wait for a slight bounce up so you don’t overpay or get IV crush, which will probably happen this week. Also read about Delta and Theta if you haven’t already. That’s my advice.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 17:47:23'] If that's what you really want, go for it. Recommendations: 1 contract only. You may be in for an unpleasant lesson (see next point). Assume you'll lose 100% of your bet. This is not an exaggeration. Others have said this, TSLA is one of the most volatile stocks out there. If it plays against you (easily 80 points against you) kiss your money good-bye. Time to expiration won't even save you. Your contract will be basically worthless cuz will be so OTM.Low ball your offer for the contract. If it doesn't fill after 5 mins modify your price and try again. You may be right in the play but a poor execution may screw you. i.e. you paid too much for the contract where you could have bought it for a couple hundred less. Don't pay ANY price for the contract.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 11:04:23'] I always tell my son that “you can easily identify the smartest people by watching to see who learns their lessons from other peoples mistakes”.  I clearly am not one of those people, but I’ll share my lesson with you:  Shorting TSLA is a BAD idea.  Betting against Elon is a bad idea!  I love a good short, but that stock defies gravity … often!  My brother sent me an article last year raving about how many millions people had made shorting TSLA..  My reply: “Interesting that they’re not talking about how many millions people have lost TRYING to short TSLA.”  I’ve been smoked 3 times trying.  Apparently I’m not such a quick study.  My advice is that this a time to be patient and let the market reveal its hand.  Take it FWIW

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 14:42:02'] Please, for the love of God, don't invest in options until you fully understand how they trade and the risk associated. Leverage investing is very risky and in a volatile market like this, it's a recipe for disaster for a beginner. Also, stay away from extra volatile stocks like TSLA, SHOP and so on. People lost many brokerage accounts when they started to play with margin.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 10:54:22'] Hey I’m still new at this too and from what I’ve read. If you buy puts , you have to make sure you have the money to cover “assignments” if your put is exercised.     Otherwise the bank will take your first born son

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 20:19:29'] If you're still learning about trading options Tesla is probably not the place to start unless you're paper trading. The reason is because Tesla options tend to be expensive, and making mistakes can be costly. However, you are correct in that Tesla has been trending down. How you'll determine your strike price will depend on your trading strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 20:39:39'] Don't
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 21:28:14'] FIRST, open a Paper Trading account with TD Ameritrade or your brokerage so you can test the trades out with fake money instead of throwing thousands of hard earned money away. Next learn how to read charts, technical analysis. Also read the book A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis by Anna Coulling.When training in the paper account, only buy a put at the break of a downtrend and get out immediately after it hits 10% or 20%. Seriously, 10% in 10mins or less, or you’ll lose it all. I lost a lot of money learning how to trade TSLA options, use a Paper Trading account and learn how to trade first. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 21:45:19'] Probably better luck day trading TSLA put options rather than gambling on a single OTM put
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 21:49:40'] If you are going to do it, use spreads or you will lose most of what you put in. I’ve profited from puts and calls but always have a higher success with spreads especially with Tesla for me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-09 21:58:00'] Here's the problem selling puts on TSLA.  You really have to like the price you set.  Because if TSLA dumps 100 points below that price...you are going to have to wait, and potentially for a long time, to recoup that money.  "Oh I'll sell calls against my position."So frickin' lame and theta like.Say you sell a 750....get assigned at 750 when it gets to 650.now you sell a 30 DTE 775 call for like 5.  Not that much.During that time TSLA, moves up to 840.  You "try" to roll your position out, but you can't unless you go out 60 days.  You don't want to roll to an 850 Call 60 days out.  Because you fear that TSLA might go back to 1000.So you end up getting assigned at 775, you bought at 750, you make a small profit...and TSLA just blows away and you miss out on so much gains.This shit happens all the time.  It's very very hard to be patient...sometimes you need to be patient for months.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 14:41:33'] From what I can see, there’s essentially zero extrinsic value left on that contract. It’s deep ITM and almost at expiration. So exercise and selling the contract generate the same profit, and if they had shares they wanted to get rid of then 🤷🏽‍♂️
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 14:37:21'] It expires tomorrow and is ITM by quite a bit. That's hardly early. It basically has zero value.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 18:45:53'] By my count they gave up 0.14/share in extrinsic by exercising early. They were probably worried about tesla having a green day tomorrow and decided to go on and cash out their position so they could have the cash ready tomorrow morning to do some buyingif tesla ends less than a $1 in the green tomorrow then they made the correct decision
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 15:11:06'] If you have time, look into [the binomial model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_options_pricing_model). What you’ll see is that on non-dividend paying stocks, it’s never optimal to exercise calls early, but it IS often optimal to exercise puts earlyBasic idea: a stock has unlimited upside, but limited downside. If a put is deep ITM, there’s almost no extrinsic value. As a result, it’s better to exercise early to lock in gains right nowFor a deeper explanation, look at chapter 13 of hull’s options, futures, and other derivatives

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 15:56:51'] You can quickly estimate how much extrinsic value an option has left with the delta. When delta reaches .99 to 1.00, you're at the point that all (or nearly all)  value is intrinsic and there's zero (or close to zero) extrinsic left. When this happens your chance of early assignment greatly increases for the reasons others have already discussed.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 20:46:30'] I mean, I'd also exercise it. Selling the put and then the 100 shares involves 2 sales (actions). Exercising is just one action, so it's less work. There is a risk too: what if the put gets sold, then TSLA drops a bit? I guess the question is, if you have 100 TSLA and want to get rid of them, and have an ITM put, why not exercise the put? Why do puts even exist?
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 22:00:13'] Sometimes people just click the wrong button. Or they think they have to exercise to lock in a profit because they don’t understand how options work. Or whatever.There will always be options that get assigned when there’s no rational explanation. If you’re banking on never being on the receiving end of an irrational exercise, you shouldn’t be in that trade. Because it will happen. Eventually.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 14:27:23'] An option buyer has the option to exercise at any time once the put is ITM.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 14:40:25'] Ok - I think I understand now. If I owned the put and couldn't find a buyer, the best option would be to exercise to lock in the profit. Or, thats the easiest way to lock in the profit. Thanks for the responses.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 19:08:05'] It's a good strategy if the market keeps on moving up slowly. Drastic moves can cause trouble, especially if you hold too many contracts for your account size.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 12:43:21'] Yeah I've been trading this for many years. Go small (i.e. less contracts) when the VIX is low, like now. Ladder in bigger positions when it spikes. You could also go closer to the money when the VIX spikes. Buy a way OTM put (1-2 delta) for protection. When IV is low, I'd take profits earlier (30-40%).Use the ES unless you have portfolio margin. Otherwise the buying power utilization is very inefficient.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 14:45:16'] When IV is too low to sell puts, it is definitely too low to sell strangles. Neutral strategies profit from IV contraction and time decay versus movement. IVR is at its 52 week low.SPX/ES aren’t more safe than those ETFs and equities that you mentioned. /ES is ~215,000 dollar notional product, SPX is ~430,000 dollar notional product.SPX is at a negative IVR. These are the red flags with your trades
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 08:47:25'] I've had similar struggles managing options against stocks due to volatility and assignment risk.  My primary strategy is a 12-Delta SPX Strangle, opened 45 DTE, roll out at 21 DTE, exit at 50% profit, and roll untested when tested is greater than 15-Delta.  It sucks up a lot of buying power, but I've also been mechanically managing this strategy for years.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 12:28:16'] How do you decide when to sell strangles and when they're overpriced?Why strangles and not straddles?  Why are those strikes the most profitable?With 30DTE 10 delta and 5 delta options, it'll take a long time for you to figure out you're losing money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-12 01:16:31'] Good idea, I have also been doing theta plays for a while but now that volatility is gone from the market I am thinking of calendar strategy. Wts your thought on strangle vs calendar ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-11 15:51:29'] I love the theta Strat's such as selling puts.  That's pretty much all I do and to be honest, the returns are pretty good!  As long as you choose solid names so that if you get exercised you're protected, you'll be good.  I also use a hybrid where I sometimes sell put credit spreads (very solid names).  Reading your comment and based on the deltas of your straddle, you are assuming more upside for the market which is my bias as well.  Selling puts or theta strategies however don't allow that upside gain as our returns are more or less fixed.  The strangle is an interesting idea.  Personally, I am considering a call roll strategy where I go 30 days out and get at the monies.  This will give me the upside I need to keep up with the market while the puts will continue to print.  That being said, I should probably investigate methods to hedge my downside just in case.What do you guys think though, strangle to pad the stats or call roll?  I'm curious.Also, I am using a bigger portfolio

I don't really want to sell the stock but want to make some side cash on options.  So I want to sell a Put contract (right?).  Looking at E-Trade I see this.  Strategy Put,   Sell Close, Quantity 1  Expire Jun 23'23, strike 195, type put  bid x size 19.15 x 115   (this verbiage confuses me still)  Estimated Proceeds: 1914.32  Based on the above and that I want these to expire (out of the money?  is that the correct phrase?):  I'm saying that, I bet AAPL will stay below 195 up until Jun 23'23.  If the option expires how can I can I tell how much money I get?  Don't you (or can't you) get a % just for selling the put option?  If the option does get sold.  The estimated proceeds is 1914.32.  Does this get taken from the stock I'm holding?  It would sell enough stock units to make up the estimated1914.32?Can I relate an option quantity to an actual # of stocks?Regarding bid x size.  What does this mean?  In my head, the bid is the price to buy the option contract and there are 115 what?  Is this related to quantity?    For example, if I raised my quantity to 115, do I get all the bids of 19.15?  So then if everything expired I would get 19.15 x 115 dollars?  Why is this harder to understand than assembly code?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-20 14:54:17'] If you sell a put option contract on an underlying stock or commodity that is out of the money, is it possible that the buyer could exercise the option while it's a losing trade thereby assigning you the shares?It doesn't make sense for the put option buyer to exercise the contract it while it's out of the money when they could just sell at whatever stock/commodity on the exchange to get a higher price than the OTM put strike price, but I'm interested in selling put options/put option credit spreads and really need to understand if sometimes you're holding out for the option to expire worthless (or for the price to decay enough to buy back the contract to lock in your profits) and you get assigned the shares unexpectedly when the contract is out of the money?

POST_TEXT: b"Greetings everyone,\n\nCant sleep even after a couple of sleeping pills. Today I got caught up in TSLA action and averaged my position until there were no more money left for me to do so. \n\nI made a decision to hold this position overnight. Although, I doubt there is any chance for me to get out of this without being wounded. \n\nAm completely devastated by the price action and by being such a fool. My life savings are being destroyed right in front of my eyes in a matter of hours.\n\nPlease be very cautious and dont break your own rules. You dont want to experience such unnecessary soul crushing event irl.\n\nEdit:\nGuys, I can't express how heart-warming it is to read all those uplifting comments from you. I'm beyond grateful for this. You really put a seed of hope in my soul that I can and will recover from this and it might not take as many years as I fear.\n\nUpdate:\nAs of now I'm going to hold my position till lunch time and see how everything goes, because my puts already almost worthle"

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 19:13:36'] You are still alive and there are people around you that love you and need you. Don’t forget that and don’t do anything stupid. Losses can always be repaired.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 18:54:40'] Never average down on short term options, especially if you are down on the postion
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:04:19'] You qualify for Wallstreet bets with the right loss porn.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 18:51:17'] This is why you never go all in, no matter how confident you are in the trade.Any one trade can go horribly wrong. Trading is probabilistic in nature and no matter how good you are you're going to miss on a lot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 21:12:35'] u/reallytastybanana have you considered converting part of your position into a strangle? That would be selling a fraction and selling OTM calls. I'm thinking ballpark 20% of your current position and converting to calls.Secondly, perhaps consider converting some of your puts into credit  spreads by selling puts in front of them.Third, consider selling 10% or 20% at a relatively extreme loss before going into expiry where it'll be worse.This is perhaps an extreme exercise in position repair. Some of your long puts are lottery tickets for a big price drop, so I'd hang on to some of them.With the above, if the price pops up you'll recoup some losses from the OTM calls. If the price stays neutral, you'll gain from having sold puts and you can feel good about watching puts lose value.  If the price drops, then your remaining long puts will gain some of their value back. In any case you won't be back to 100%, but hopefully your losses will have been buffered and not as extreme.Take care above else, your mental health is paramount. Money is only worth so much, often less than we would think.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 19:04:29'] Playing with money you can't afford to lose. Thats real gambling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 19:54:29'] I'm genuinely sorry this happened to you. Hopefully you have a strong support network in place, now would be the time to reach out to them.Stay strong, and remember there are always resources open to you should you need them.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 18:54:07'] ngl i bought some TSLA 745 calls this morning and sold for 2x at noon. What I did was equally as risky. Still, I never buy puts on tesla :/But dude, if weeklies are stressing you out that much, to the point where you need meds to sleep, then you need to not trade risky FDs. Try LEAPS or monthlies instead.EDIT: You put a lot of money in? Do you have a gambling addiction? I don't mean this badly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:40:13'] I applaud your mental strength to share and admit your story here! Everyone drums up when they win but keep low when they loose, and I commend you for your courage by sharing your caution with everyone here! Be safe and know this will soon pass! It will be just another veteran style story you will be telling years from now. I invite you to consider this a expensive yet valuable lesson that will actually help you be richer if you allow this to be a lesson and not give up investing all together ! This lesson is that of risk management behind every stock market decision you make. Most of us believe that it is the good trading and analysis skills that leads to more money, but lot of people already have successful trades here and there, but the fact is you will bring in the most money in with your other silent skill - risk management. It looks counterintuitive but you don’t make long term money from your trading skill but you make more money with your skill for risk consideration before you make any step.  This is why I say it’s a valuable lesson for you. It takes hard lesson to be a hero and it’s yours, flount it and use it properly to riches. Remember Warren Buffet also learned such a similar hard lesson (it happened to him with his very first stock purchase). Don’t stop investing you’ve learned lessons and you will quickly be on your way to riches as you collect more experiences up your sleeve. Remember at the end of the day money is less fun compared to the this fun of art of making money! Keep moving on, cheers champ!
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:59:21'] So I read Market Wizards awhile back. The common denominator with most of them is the fact that they all had some catastrophic loss early in their trading career. That loss triggered something within them and they came roaring back. They dug deep, read more, and became more defensive traders.  Refine that strategy, reload that morale, and I hope to see you crushing it in the future :)

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 18:44:59'] Carrying options to expiry is always tricky unless you have the delta. One off days like these close to expiry have been the widow-maker trades.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:47:11'] You are too emotionally attached to this money. I know you are because I was just like you. What can I tell you?...-Everything will be fine. It will get better. I’m not talking about your Tesla position. But in general with trading. -you need to take all this money out of your account. Put it in your bank. -if you want to keep trading you are going to take $2000 and put it into an account. And you’re not going to add a SINGLE dollar. If you add money you will hurt yourself more. It’s not even an OPTION to add money to this account. You MUST grow it. -stop fucking shorting. Literally just don’t short anything. Calls only. This one is huge. -you need to think about the way you trade differently. You are trading your P/L, not the chart that’s in front of you. It’s *okay* to take losses. Sometimes trades don’t go your way. What’s not okay is to add to a losing trade. Slow down man. Everything is gonna be okay. If you need help/need to talk my DM’s are open. I was in your shoes not too long ago my friend. I understand your pain. You are fine. ❤️

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 05:32:11'] Thank you for posting this, as hard as it is.  Helpful for others to see painful reminders not to blow up their accounts.  With Puts it’s advisable to go deep OTM *downward* so the pain is waaay lessened.Hang in there.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:21:53'] Don't bet against Elon. Cut your losses and buy call instead. The earning release is an unusual Monday (usually Wednesday) which may mean a few things. 1. The numbers are good. 2. May announce FSD V9.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 19:08:30'] Please do not try to double or triple your account in few months. That market was gone. The market we are currently in is churning heavily but keeping the index up to carry on this joke for a long time. To keep the index up at all times, algorithms target the top 10 market cap stocks. TSLA is one of them. have some quiet time..come back stronger later with low expectations.&#x200B;Good luck

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 07:31:51'] I'm sorry to hear this but stopping buying puts is the only answer.  This market and specifically this stock keeps finding a way to climb the wall of worry. This short trade hasn't worked for like the last 720957305 people that tried shorting this stock and it won't work for the next 9573057983.  Embrace Elon and his green hulk cock because he's going to continue to rip through bears and send them to an early grave.  You were unfortunately just the latest victim. Also, shorting Tesla is already an extremely crowded trade.  Crowded trades do not work for shorting and eventually almost all bears get their asses handed to them.  Just look at GME for reference.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 10:59:14'] I am in the same boat and it happened about a week ago.. I broke my rules and decided to average my position until I had nothing left with SPY puts. I lost my life savings too as the price action was around the time SPY broke out up. I know what is probably running through your mind right now, and I’m not gonna lie to you, but it definitely gets worse. You beat yourself up for it. You contemplate the worst shit possible. Hell, I’m still struggling now. But just know that you’re not alone. Millions of people have been in the same boat if not worse and come out of it. It is indeed really just money and just paper. I’m trying to pick myself up right now. I honestly just want to break even and quit from it all. This shit isn’t a joke.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 12:42:17'] Dude... if you held put, your puts should have returned a lot after today's dip... give us an update
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 19:34:20'] Trading FDs is a sport these days brother. Stay strong you’ll be back. Personally I like to set my stop loss at an amount I’d be happy getting out, if I’m looking to make 3-5%, if it’s approaching -2.5% I’d find a good place to get out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:01:25'] It’s only money. Don’t do anything stupid. What you should take away from this is how IMPORTANT and NECESSARY proper risk management is. Wish you the best
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:10:22'] I'm staying away from puts having lost 110k. Calls generate money quick if you jump in on time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 21:07:04'] Yeah Tesla has crushed many dreams. I call it the Most manipulated stock ever. This keeps me from buying it anymore lol. Hedgies will milk you dry. I’m sure you paid a nice penny for a $700 put. I got some advice for you. If you keep dreaming on it coming back down it will come down one time and you better take what they give you. Crumbs I’m sure but it’ll be better than nothing. Don’t pray on Tesla down fall after a 60 point run. It’ll come down another 20 points to eat up the bulls who get in on this new upward momentum then it shall be finished lol, everyone looses💀This just my opinion not financial advice. I’m not a fa. I’m just... f it man
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 21:10:24'] I lost six figures this January on GME strangles. I'm still here. If I may share since advice... Meditate/become mindful of your thoughts and how they are evoking emotions. Eat clean. Go to bed early. Don't drink. Be kind to yourself. Get a virtual therapist you meet with weekly (I used BetterHelp).  And I got back on the job market and interviewed a ton and got a new job too, that was pretty cool. I'm finally starting to feel like I'm on the other end of this. Best of luck to you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 21:20:13'] Been swing trading PLTR for the past few weeks with huge success. Was down 60% last month (solely because of this stock).  after learning its pattern and swing trading accordingly I broke even and then some. It had such a predictable pattern. Usually when it hits close to $23.50 it drops down. Buy puts when it’s high, calls when it’s low. Always bounces from $21/$22-$23/$24 within a couple days. so as usual, this morning i bought 15 contracts of 24.5p 4/16. “Easy money” I told myself. It just. Kept. Climbing. Pretty much back where I was last month. 2 hours into market open I thought about averaging down, so glad I didn’t.

Sometimes we all lose, be grateful you are still alive, If you are under 40, you still have more than half of your life in front of you. Think about Warren Buffet, he has 100 billion, but I bet that he would give 99 billion to be 50 again. Your time on earth can't be measured in dollars. You can earn infinitely, but you can't live infinitely. Don't look at your account, it's gone anyways. Cry, meditate (helped me a lot), and get back on your feet. You will be back on top sooner than you think. If you have a wife cool, have sex with her, if not, go out with some females, will help a lot, and they will care less than you think about your loss. You will find out that you are the only guy that cares about your losses, your friends, family, will forget the day after.

This isn’t poker so don’t go all in, even if you have pocket Aces. Can still lose to three 2s. Set your rules and stick to them. Set stop loss or trailing stop. Take profits where you can get it and don’t be greedy. Need like a Ten Commandments of option trading lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:34:46'] Well, depending on where you bought in, it could always go back down tomorrow. Everything had a good bounce today after yesterday’s pull back.Anyway, never short Tesla. Lesson learned, I hope.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 21:51:26'] You’ll make that money back sooner than you think. This was an expensive lesson but what you learned from it is absolutely critical and makes you twice the trader you were before.I remember when I learned my first lesson like this, I thought I would never do it again but I ended up repeating it a few times over the years before it really sunk in. it’s really several lessons in one: position size, risk management, and directional decision making.You will recover, you will learn from it and come back stronger than before, and you will dominate in the future. It’s things like this that makes or breaks traders. Don’t do anything stupid, it’s just money, and honestly no successful trader has ever gotten where they are without learning a couple very hard lessons along the way. You got this
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 21:56:57'] I know what it's like to be down 100k and hopeless. I also know what it's like to work hard, pay off that debt and be up 6 figures, only to lose another 40k due to gambling.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 23:10:35'] Stop the hating guys. We've all made bad decisions. I've only been doing options for 6 months. I only do weeklies every Monday and want my options to expire worthless. I do it for the premiums. This is my side hustle. My regular gig is ER nurse.  Every minute I'm not working,  I'm doing research. I don't understand a lot of what you guys talk about iron something and leap and spreads, so I don't do this.  I started with 5k and now I have 23k. I've been assigned only 3 times. I've been able to sell those on Mondays for a profit... last time being yesterday when I was assigned RIOT. My strike was $50.50 and it closed @50.05. I never trade the first hour or so after the market opens on Monday. I let the crazy, antsy people who have been nuts all weekend get their dow Jones fix to get over it.. so I made a quick $600 on RIOT and proceeded to sell puts. Yes, I know about capital gains. Thanks to all of you for posting because you ALL are helping me and othe noobs.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 00:13:52'] Just money. If you ever start imagining what you are going to buy or pay for with it, get out.Well - get out of trading options with it anyway. My retirement money is in a boring diversifies portfolio. A boring portfolio that is absolutely going to make me a reasonably wealthy 50 year old. How’s that for boring?Options are what I do instead of playing video games. Money is just the points in the game. I can DO that because my basics are all taken care of. I never let my options account become more than about 10% of my real account.It is going to all be ok.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 10:48:35'] I was exactly where you were a couple days ago, but on the opposite end. It was an intraday scalp that got out of control. I was bearish on TSLA, but something deep down told me not to bet against TSLA, so I decided to buy calls. Lost big. Revenge traded the next couple days and lost even bigger. I finally had to calm down and revaluate everything and now I’m very slowly digging myself out of this hole. Point is just take a step back. It’s not as bad as it seems.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-13 20:08:43'] I have to ask, and I by no means want to rub it in or make it worse - but why did you buy Puts on TSLA?  Yesterday TSLA gapped up, broke through a major SMA and finished at its high, maintaining strength even in the last 35 minutes of Monday despite the market going down towards the end.  Literally everything pointed towards TSLA being bullish.  I almost never buy straight calls but in this case I did (I also did call debit spreads) because it was too good of a setup on a stock like this to pass up.What was it about TSLA that made you decide to get Puts? Again, if it’s too upsetting then no need to answer, not trying to make anything worse.  But if you’re willing to discuss perhaps you can figure out how not to do it again?EDIT : I read the other comments and see what happened.  Seems like you are also pretty clear on what the mistake was.... those Puts are worth about $1 on opening tomorrow.  Not sure how many you have right now, but put a working order in for $3 so many you can salvage some of it on a dip?

TSLA just reported record breaking numbers , also on the charts, there is no reason why you would short this.  The charts say it will stay flat or move higher.  In this case we already know what happened and the priced rocketed up.  I would sell your options for what little you can pick up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-14 00:03:07'] The best way to predict Tesla’s price up or down is to watch AMAZON stock behaviour.  If AMZN has a strong boost up, TESLA will follow up within a day or two.  The opposite is true.A 10% drop within next 3 days is unlikely but 5% is feasible.AMAZON is at the peak right now.  We will see a slower increase, may be by another 1%.10% devaluation must happen and I am expecting it to happen next week or at the latest the following week.The landmark is once S&P reaches 4200 is one the dip will happen.  Because by then plenty of money is on the table and the dealer is ready then to pool the trigger and cash out.  It will happen so fast you won’t know what hit you.Calls are more risky now.

POST_TEXT: b'Late December last when things were all down I bought a 130 call in TSLA expiring 16 June. Paid 26.40. I kept the contract with the hope of exercising it as I was /still am interested in TSLA accumulation for the long term. That contract is now worth 87.50. When I called Fidelity asking about exercising they said that I will have to pay 13K to exercise it and will not get to keep the gains from the contract, is this true? I was under the assumption that I will lose the 26.40 which will go to the option seller and I get to keep the  61.1 that the option has profited (which I had hoped to use towards the 13K which I will eventually need to exercise it). Also, If I exercise it, what will be the purchase dates of the shares that I exercise (will it be the date of exercise or the date I bought the contract?) \n\nAppreciate any helpful guidance with the above or is there any other better way to profit from the ballooned up contract price.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:40:08'] Selling to close will net you $61.10 or $6110 profit per contract.If you want shares, then sell to close the option and use the proceeds, plus any cash needed to buy them on the open market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:21:40'] It's a contract enabling you to buy 100 shares of TSLA at $130 per share.  It's currently worth 87.50 per share (or, $8750.)  If you exercised it, why would you get $6110?  Exercising it means buying 100 shares of TSLA at $130 per share.  That means giving your brokerage $13,000, and they give you 100 shares of TSLA.  That's it.Imagine you bought a coupon saying "1 bottle of Tide for $15" for $5.  Then you go to Walmart, and someone standing outside says "hey, I'll give you $12 for that coupon." You ignore him, go into Walmart, and use the coupon.  Using the coupon means you give the cashier $15 plus the coupon, and they give you 1 bottle of Tide.  They keep the coupon.  They don't give you $7 just because the guy outside was willing to buy the coupon from you for $12.What you're also ignoring is that it's better to sell the call and buy the shares on the open market.  TSLA closed at 217.61.  That means the call is ITM by 87.61.  87.50 is the bid, and 88.40 is the ask.  The last is 88.00.  Which means you probably could have sold it at market close for more than 87.61, which means you'd save money selling it and buying the shares on the open market instead of exercising.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 18:08:58'] Thank you all. This is my first time exercising it, hence the confusion. I thought I get to keep the profits from the rising share price as well as get to buy it at the lower strike price. Its just one or the other. What I have come to the conclusion is that it makes very little to no sense to exercise it.  Sell and buy it in the open market is the way to go. Thanks again and happy investing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:20:11'] You do have to pay 13k to exercise it.  You said you wanted to pay a premium for the right to buy 100 shares at 130, so that's 13k.  You'll be the owner of 100 shares worth 216, so until you dispose of those, you only have unrealized gains.  The exercise date is your purchase date.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 05:45:30'] 87.50 - 26.40 = 61.10 These deep insightful questions, from trolls , is why I keep reading this Reddit , which has become drivel. Does anyone think this guy ever made a trade in his life??
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 22:04:29'] Don’t exercise it. There’s very few reasons for a call owner to ever exercise the contract and they’re usually dividend related. Just sell it and buy the shares if you really want to own them or maybe start selling puts at a level you’d like to own the shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 23:19:16'] You should not be trading options
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:14:32'] Bump. I'm curious as well.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 20:22:29'] You can close the option. Then use the proceeds to buy shares.  If it’s a taxable account and you want to avoid capital gains you will need to come up with cash equal to (share price - in the money portion) * #contracts * 100.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 01:46:34'] Reading half asleep so sorry if info was already received.  Buying the contract means you are posting a “interested in 100 shares at $x.xx, let’s negotiate a time and a premium I’ll pay for that option”.  The only time youll collect a premium on that option is if you sell that contract and get out of it-exercising this contract means buying the shares at the agreed upon price you paid to have.  Remember you’re dealing with people and banks, if you got to keep the new contract price AND buy the shares at a huge difference than current valuation, someone would be getting screwed twice….but man would that make options more fun!If the you sell the contract you would pay short term gains on the sale minus the premium you paid (in a taxable account) If you  get the shares, you own them that day, so I believe your short term for the next 52 weeks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 05:37:31'] If you sell the contract, you get paid. If you exercise it then there is nothing to sell and there is no 13k profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 06:17:45'] So you bought with no understanding of what an actual option is? You paid premium for an 'option' of buying at the strike...
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 07:14:38'] Its a pretty good deal but you cant cash it in AND excersise it, its one or the other
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 11:32:29'] It depends on whether you want the profit or you want to own 100 shares of TSLA at a discount.   If it were me, I’d sell the call and use a portion of the profits to buy fewer than 100 shares of TSLA.  Then do something else with the rest.  But I don’t want to own that much TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 19:38:30'] Your option is a contract, and the unrealized profit is the difference between the price you paid and the current market value. So, you must sell it to realize those profits. If you instead exercise said contract, you’re telling your broker you want to buy 100 shares of the underlying for the strike price (100*130=13,000). But, now that the contract has been fulfilled, you no longer have a contract to turn around and sell to another buyer.Hence why it’s one or the other. Majority of options are NOT exercised. Most traders are just looking to profit from the change in the value of the contract itself. In the future, if you do want to build an equity position through options and keep your options’ profits, you’d be selling cash secured or naked puts. Since it sounds like you don’t fully understand the basics of options yet, maybe hold off on venturing down this road (plus margin is required).
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-05 17:30:53'] It might be helpful to point out that because you are paying $13,000 for 100 shares worth $21,761; the idea is that you are to:Buy 100 shares with $13,000.Sell 59.7 shares (60 shares rounded up).Now you own 40 shares for free with your winnings from the trade.This means you probably bought about a 60 delta call when you first bought it; if I'm not mistaken. Slightly in the money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-21 15:48:16'] Take an example :Take a 45 days out cash secured put on TLT . TLT July 21 99/95 credit spread will give you around $102. That means, say if you repeat the trade for say 1000 times, you Win 700 times. For calculation sake, let’s say 7 wins on 10 attempts. That means you make 102*7 = $714. While the 3 losses will set you back by 400*3= 1200.So for 10 trades, you will most likely make a loss of 1200-714= $486. This proved to you that selling credit spread Dillon TLT right now is not a good bet. To make your you are net profitable you need to select a trade where the probability of making profits over a long period of time is more than the probability of you loosing full amount. You can further optimize it by cutting of all trades at 100% loss (I.e if the premium you collected is $102, close the trade if the value of credit spread goes above $204). This will reduce your probability further but will help you avoid max loss. You can further optimize it using technicals and based on whether IV is high or not.But bottom line: Just because you get $100 premium in a trade, you are not going to make $10,000 in 100 such trades. You might realistically plan for say $2000(i.e $20 per trade). Anything more would be your skills or luck.Cash secured puts and wheel strategy might perform better.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-17 15:19:57'] The most profitable way to capitalize on the option would be to sell the option. That’s what you do. It would be the same profit basically, but eventually you could exercise the option, since you are long TSLA, but you’d have to have enough capital to purchase 100 shares of TSLA at $703 each.  You’re up 63% on it right now which is great. Some would sell now or already have grabbed their profits and sold. So that’s up to you to decide, and of course we don’t know what will happen to the market and TSLA between now and January so it could do worse. You also have to eventually worry about Theta, time decay as you get closer to your expiration date. So TL;DR, you buy the options to sell them for profit generally speaking. Deciding when you think that is most profitable is the next big decision to make, but congrats on being nicely ITM.

So if I would want to do this with indices/ETFs as underlying, I would need to cover my risk for a written option by buying a future on the same indice? Does it necessarily need to be a future (because maybe the broker would only recognise something like that as counterbalance?) or would an ETF or basically anything that hedges against my option work as well?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 03:30:57'] Hello everyone!    I tried to post this exact thing but it got removed by the automoderator so I'll give it here a shot:    Is there any place that lists historical and expired options contracts that were available in the past? I have tried to get data for historical options prices for certain European stocks to be used for analysis, but the problem is that this is only available through data vendors with costs I have no money or willingness to pay for. I am only doing analysis and could derive theoretical prices by using the BSM model, but the problem is that it requires a strike price and I would much rather have expired contracts to tell me exactly what they were rather than just winging it.    So the question is: is there any place that lists expired contracts? Is there a place that lists historical options contract prices that don't cost a rigorous amount of money, as I have not yet found anything for this part? I am analyzing options prices for European stocks which makes things a little harder I think.    Thank you in advance if you can in any way help me with this problem!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 07:33:14'] Hi, max profit wasn't reached and I got fukked, why?I bought a PUT at $407.5 and sold a PUT at $407.For long leg i paid 4.862, for short leg i got 4.642, resulting in -$0.22 debit per combo X 100 = -$22 \* 5 contracts = -$110.Now, from my understanding, at price $407 and below i should have had the max profit which is 0.5 \* 5 \* 100 = $250 - $110 = $140.Now, one day to expiration (tommorrow last trading day) the price of underlying was $405, profit on my contract was $15 or oscillating around $40.My question is, why I didn't have my full profit $140, when the price was below $407.I know there is something like time value (which is the extra i guess?) but i didn't "know" then, that it might work also the other way, that means - lower value before expiration, and max value at expiration, which seems to me quite as bogus.Thanks to the fact that i didn't have the max profit yesterday, i didn't sell, and now i am OTM in max loss.

Now Im very aware theres still a whole lot more to learn a whole hell of a lot more so thats why Im here with this question. So earlier this week on Monday, I came across the stock $Muln/Mullen on and saw a lot of buzz and well the price was very cheap (like $0.07 at the time) and I had small cash to spare. So on Robinhood I purchased some shares and some call contracts for a strike price of $0.5 with the expiration date of May 19th, 2023.Then, later this week they announced they were doing reverse split of 1:25, and I didnt fully understand what that meant for me other than seeing that the shares I had turned into a fraction of what I had before and the price of Mullen then went up to $1.50. The call option is still there so my question is what will happen to it now?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 08:45:17'] Hi folks,As I’m doing my first steps with options trading, there are some points I couldn’t figure out with Iron Condor. I understand that max profit is taken when it expires in the range of the short legs, and max loss is occurring when it expires outside the range of the long legs. But the things I don’t understand are:1. As IC consists multiple legs and potentially multiple buyers/sellers on the other side, is it possible that some/all the legs will get early assignment in different times before the expiration date, thus discomposing my setup?2. In case it expires in the money, how exactly max loss occurs? Doesn’t it convert into short position of the underline stock/ETF?Hopefully I was clear enough..

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 13:57:43'] Help understanding what happened here?I'm new to trading options and set up some low risk trades to get my head around things (well, high risk options but where I'm prepared /expecting them to expire worthless) while I build up a better understanding.I purchased 2 OOTM call contacts on Credit Suisse, with a Jan 2024 expiry, based on the thesis that the banks as a whole overcorrected and will improve as the general market improves.I was down a bit generally on the calls as Credit Suisse continued to trade down beyond my predicted floor, but no biggie I thought, I have a year for it to recover. So I was pleased today when I checked the market as Credit Suisse was up 5%. I opened up my brokerage app expecting to see a bit of improvement in the value of my contracts but found the opposite.Credit Suisse up 5%, my options down -20%.I'm not upset, this is exactly the kind of learning I wanted to do with those first few purchases, but it's clearly shown I have a gap in my understanding.Now, I expected some IV crush as we approached the strike date, but these contracts are barely opened so I thought I'd have some runway? And the contacts held their value over the last week when the stock has been trading down, but dropped massively on the day the stock started trading back up?Any advice or enlightenment would be much appreciated!

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 16:51:02'] You had me lost for a bit. I read this as TLSS smashes earnings and got so confused looking at the numbers.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-27 03:07:12'] I agree that the earnings report was very good for Tesla, but I disagree with a lot of your assumptions or opinions at the end. 1.  To say that this means all the talk about Lucid or Nio not being competition is a little short-sighted.  For one, Lucid will just now be delivering products to consumers in this upcoming quarter, so we can’t know whether it’s a better product or not until we see it.  Nio for their part is actually doing quite well in China which poses a threat to Tesla’s ambition in trying to gain market share there.  Let’s not forget the fiasco surrounding Chinese customers not happy about the QC in their newly delivered Model 3s.  And with the Chinese government basically saying Tesla spies on Chinese citizens, this could have an impact on sales in the region.  If Nio is able to expand production and penetrate markets beyond Asia, they may indeed be a force to be reckoned with.  And let’s not forget Rivian, GMs electric push, Toyota entering the space next year, and the success of Hyundai/Kia.2. You mentioned Tesla AI being an attractive feature for the future of autonomous driving, but you failed to mention that Tesla believes in going all in on just using cameras for their autonomous system. This is a HUGE problem as the cameras are only reliable in certain weather conditions and there is no fail safe in place when the system fails.  Why do you think every other major car manufacturer and autonomous driving companies use a host of sensors including LiDAR?  It’s because autonomous driving is only as good as the ability of the system to gain as much information as possible from the environment and be able to process that data.  Not to mention engineering redundancy is a great way to have a fail safe measure in case something happens.  If camera 23 goes bad or no longer functions properly (which camera failures happen in cars a lot), then the LiDAR is able to provide a fail safe to pick up where that camera left off.  Is there a glare preventing camera 11 from capturing data? No worries, the sensors can provide information where that camera can’t. Which brings me to my last point…3. Tesla is great because of Elon but it also has many shortcomings because of Elon’s ego.  In fact, if Tesla were to fail tomorrow it’s most likely because his ego got in the way.  This is what keeps some investors weary of the company.  Elon said he thought LiDAR was dumb technology that wasn’t needed and is doubling down on cameras only as the solution.  The biggest complaint in the new Plaid models is the steering wheel, with even Marques Brownlee saying it would be a great car except for this and yet Elon Musk is doubling down saying he won’t offer any other type of wheel.  It’s Elon’s ego that can end up being the downfall of the company.  And that’s something investors have to be mindful about.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 18:42:27'] You're clueless if you think VW and F will produce a greater volume of EVs than Tesla at a lower average cost. When do you expect this magical transformation to occur?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-26 18:22:39'] I streamed the call and I did not like the tone of the call, this was going to be a nothing call anyways as nothing new was really going on but I did not like a few things about it. 1. Elon did not sound optimistic about anything, he kept telling us why things were taking time vs telling us when things were going to finish. 2. He wavered on next year growth between 50 and 100%, this is telling me that he thinks they'll get delivering new cars out of the new factors in Q2 next year or late Q1. 3. We won't get to 1M vehicles this year, not that we have to, but about 830-850k inline with analysts. 4. FSD isn't ready and he didn't hype it at all. 5. Subscriptions were a bust as he didn't hype it, he eve said "at this point the value proposition on subscriptions are so-so, we need to get FSD done". Doesn't sound we see the light at the end of the tunnel. I think 2021 is going to be pretty sideways for the stock, it reminds me of the 2018 when we knew that China was going to open and we were looking for the 5k per week number and went through production hell, then came out the other side of it. At that point the stock started rallying, once Tesla got some scale. We are going through that again, but this time with 2 factories, an entirely new way of building cars, with brand new battery chemistry, with brand new ways to install the batteries in the cars with brand new factors in brand new places and during a chip shortage. So this earnings call asked for patience and we'll give Tesla as much time as they need, its super hard to do what they are doing and we ask too much too soon. My opinion is that the stock will just hang around until we see some clarity and results like in 2018, so a great time to buy more! Every month just buy more.

A line of thinking like “oh it’s going to be super bad?! It’s going to start super bad with YOU then Elon!”I’m imagining thousands waking up saying “oh you wrecked my SPY calls?!?

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-04 16:10:27'] This is r/options and not r/stocks right? So i assume one should at least know that this is simply strikes pinning and not some conspiracy theory.
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-04 17:46:34'] Not at my computer atm, but I'd be looking at the volume profiles in relation to the technicals. 700 is a psych level so I'm not all that surprised. Especially coupled with what someone said previously about the MM's not wanting to pay out on the contracts which does happen. I would assume 700 range has a lot of volume built up which acts as support/resistance depending on where the price is. Gaging where it's more likely to fall or rise from its current levels can be better interpreted using the technicals, volume, and volume profiles.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/143lj3u/iv_and_hv_relationship/'
POST_TEXT: b'Hi,\n\nI am trying to learn more about IV and HV percentile before making my trades. Can someone explain this better ? My understanding is that IV is future looking and HV is past looking. Example of TSLA as of today:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zx6lxt2p5n4b1.png?width=210&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89e817611dfef980979273fec1a043bc5fcc76f8\n\nDoes this mean historically IV very low and right now IV is very high so its possible that all the volatility is priced in and more chances of volatility going down.  \n\n\nIV < HV = stock prices may change a lot and options are inexpensive  \nIV > HV = stock price changes may not be that volatile, options are expensive'
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 12:13:39'] Percentile essentially means the amount is "greater" than the others. 21% means its lower than 79% of IV in that 52 week period, and HV is 1% meaning its lower than 99% of HV in that 52 week period. The vix is at 13.93 as I type this comment which is absolutely insanely low, so the volatility both historical and implied are going to be significantly below averages.   TLDR; options are very cheap right now because volatility is stupid low
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 14:38:08'] i read it as HIV relationship. i should sleep
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 15:27:21'] Implied volatility is a number that pops out of an option pricing formula based on the actual option prices and expiry dates, strike prices, and a few other variables.  IV is used because it sort of summarizes all those variables and allows you to assess (imply) the relative price of different options.  A higher IV simply means a higher relative “price” for those options. It can also be thought of as a market price. Historical volatility is the actual measured variability of the stock.  So if IV is higher than HV, it just means that options are expensive given the history of the stock.  If you were to buy options, you would be assuming that the stock is going to be more volatile going forward.  In that way, it is forward looking.  So, when options are being bought as hedges because there is more “fear” in the market, it forces option prices upward and therefore IV increases, which is why VIX is a measure of fear in the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-08 11:42:26'] Your example does show that hv is low when compared to the last year. It's at 1% meaning it's 0.32 * 1.01 = 0.323. iv however is not extremely high at 0.484 * 1.21 = 0.58. it has been much high in the last year. Your concluding statement is also not correct. A low iv percentile doesn't mean stock prices will change a lot. It means option prices are low, and therefor taking a long position might be warren Ted (assuming a rise in volatility) The opposite is also true when iv is high you might want to sell options because prices are high and you assume a drop in volatility. However this is antithetical to how the market views that stock at that moment, because high iv means the market expects high volatility. And low iv means the market expects low volatility.And sometimes, just sometimes the market is right.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-06 05:28:37'] be careful with weeklies and over sizing your positions.what you should do is calculate the annualized expected loss on these trades and make sure its something your portfolio can afford.For example, if you spent $100 on bi weekly options,  your worst case scenario is $2600 loss at the end of the year, if you lose every single trade.to succeed long term, this loss, shouldnt be more than 5%(imo) of your entire portfolio, including the amount you save from income.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-06 06:27:32'] You got lucky. No two things about it. You should set profit target and sell then, unless you are actively monitoring it constantly. Use a profit taker type close order when you setup the sell, or something like a trailing stop loss. It will follow it down and sell when it goes back up a bit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-07 11:03:33'] Tesla is a piggy bank for Billionaires. They have more power than retail investors. The fundamentals of the company suck dog dick. If investors would put their money in F or GM or VWAGY those stocks would rise from a percentage standpoint way more than Tesla can given it's sky high valuation. But I guess it's a more solid investment to buy a company that trades at over 900 times earnings. Not that I have anything against Elon but it would be nice to see him build something that people actually want like high speed railways like they have in France and that backward country known as China. Remember the "Hyperloop" idea, it seems to have turned out to be all hype and no loop. In the mean time he continues to play with his space toys and invest billions into giving billionaires a chance to orbit the earth. I like his fuel cell technology and that could be a meaningful investment in the human condition. By now he could have outfitted the entire state of Texas with affordable backup generators but the fact is Elon really doesn't give a fuck about regular people.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-09 12:04:27'] Question:  You list "this week" the SPY options are pricing a move of 1.3% and in the prior paragraph you state how prior weeks SPY moved more than the 1% it was priced to move.  Do you or anyone give any credence to what % move options are theoretically priced at?  Stated another way...do you make a single equity trade based on that info and if so, why and how?I find that info meaningless to my analysis and trading methodology.  Including identifying entry and exit points.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 06:14:18'] There is an old expression on the street - buy the reviews and sell the news . Out of the last 45 earnings reports , 39 of them went down the day after they’ve” crushed earnings” . Why? Because they are reporting on the quarter gone by not what lies ahead. It is the governance that dictates the earnings report, unfortunately that is based on the number coming first - first they tell you what happened then they tell you what to expect . My strategy , which has worked very well, has been first to play a short term call  2-3 days ahead along with a cash covered put same equity slightly shorter duration. Equity does a run up ahead of earnings - I close my profitable call, take my cash covered put  premium - profit in both sides . Right before earnings around 3:00 before post market announcement , I take a long put sane equity hold for 2-3 days it drops right into the money I sell. A week later you revisit - most get a bounce up after the information is observed two weeks later . It’s a very good way to play earnings - Snap didn’t go that way for the first time in a long time . Try this strategy ahead of earnings this  week you will do well - it t has a high win rate.

(2) Earnings are in the past but guidance for the future could be weak, which also results in price going down after the earnings call. (3) Revenue might have increased but only at the cost of lower margins due to competition and price discounting. This also results in stock price going down. (4) Revenue and Gross margins might be good enough but SG&A is still high, stock price could correct.(5) Synergies promised during M&A fail to materialize as per the original time line. (6) Business could be cyclical with high PE when there is a trough and low P/E at the peak. Industry specific - (Pharma) - loss of patent protection, pricing power pressure from generics competition, pipeline setbacks, rise in debt due to financing of M&A activity.(Financials) - Lower Net Interest Margins (due to low FED funds rate), Increase in loan provisions for losses due to deteriorating credit metrics, Increase in non-interest operating expenses, Poor loan growth.Good Luck to all!

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-24 02:03:32'] >I would be interested in learning any other viable strategies, especially a strategy that can prosper from the move itself, without having to choose up or down.Here Is 1 way to look at how options work.Selling OTM calls or puts is a game of over/under.You think the price will move down then you sell an otm call (cc or spread).  You are playing that the price will stay "under" the strike sold.If you think the price will move up then you sell a put, playing that the price will stay "over" the strike sold.By selling OTM you give yourself a margin of error, where you can be a little wrong about the direction and still win the game.If you are not sure about the direction, but think that the price will make a move, then you can play "outside da box" by selling a butterfly or a Condor (Condor, not an iron condor)Both of these create a lower and upper level of the box, while time (date of entry and expiration) creates the sides.   You are playing that the price will move out of that box before it expires.IMHO European style options work best for the outside da box strategy because they do not have early exercise risk, so this let's you play the index options (NDX, SPX/XSP, RUT/MRUT, and DJX)

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-20 16:19:15'] You can always play volatility this way, but the fact that TSLA was up 50 or so Monday and dropped drastically today probably helped you bank a win on both ends.If TSLA had been flat Monday or Tuesday you may not have seen quite the gains you got… but either way, playing volatility during ER weeks is a fairly safe play.Congrats on the win!

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 10:09:09'] I play these as well. You did a strangle, not a straddle. Farther OTM strangles will give you more IV exposure, but also more theta decay to work against you more. If you "know for sure" IV will increase, go farther OTM like you did yesterday.IV doesn't always increase on the day of earnings. That's the only reason this isn't an automatic free money type of play. I use the IV indicator on ToS to watch how IV is movingIV ran up very hard all day yesterday on TSLA. This is more of an extreme case, not the norm. If the price stayed flat and IV did the same thing as it did yesterday, you still would have been up a decent amount on both sides of the strangle
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-21 10:50:09'] I wouldn't do a 0 day straddle like that except on something super volatile like TSLA, but I have a strategy I use to play straddles before earnings. It works pretty well:Look for stocks with IV above 70%, with weekly options, and a history of increased volatility before earnings at least 75% of the time over the last 2 years.Open a long ATM straddle 10 days before earnings. The contracts should expire the Friday after the earnings call. Immediately after opening, put in a GTC order to sell at 10% profit (some will do 15% but I'm conservative).About 50% of the time the sell order will fill itself in a couple of days. The other 50% you'll be wringing your hands right up until the day before the earnings call. Shoot for a 15% stop loss.My biggest gain doing this was in March of 2020, when I had a Nike straddle open and the market had a COVID panic drop. I made almost 50% on one trade.

For instance, if opened a Spy condor at 400/402/420/422 then my max loss should be $200 minus the credit from the trade. But if spy expires at 401, then I will have my 402 puts exercised and the 400 puts will expire out of the money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 10:04:33'] I'm using ToS and sold a call credit spread for CVS. The overall position shows a loss of $174 but the individual positions show that the call I sold has lowered in price, it's P/L being $63. The call I bought also lowered in price and it's P/L is -$33. Shouldn't the overall P/L be a positive since the money I'm making on the sold call is more than what I'm losing on the long one?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:39:37'] New trader here and had great success in March/April just selling some basic spreads and getting used to the mechanics in small dollar amounts.  I'm about 20 trades in (all profitable!) and just had my first short leg challenged and so it was my first time making an adjustment. IWM put credit spread for May 5, 2023 expiry with 172/170 strike price for an original credit of $32.  Trade moved against me this week, so yesterday when it was about 1% out of the money with the short side showing a delta of 0.35 or so, I decided to make an adjustment by putting a call credit spread on to make it an iron condor.  Sold a far OTM 181/183 call credit spread for $28 premium (which is currently quite profitable). Today, IWM continues to go down and we breach the strike with a current market price of $171.34.  I roll the position by one week to May 12th for a $0.00 net to give it a bit more time to recover.  I believe most traders will only roll if they receive a net credit.Question - did I ever overadjust here by doing both the IC and the roll?  Would you have just closed the position?  In retrospect, as the stock continues to go down, I think rolling without a credit was a mistake.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 09:21:56'] That is a calculated risk for sure. All estimates are just fine. Only minor risk here is that if out of those 500k cars if say 50% got FSD that would be $2 billion in profit and they already had $1.5 Billion in FSD back up cash. But this won’t happen it will be like 20%. But if they decide to add some of that $1.5 Billion to profit area their margins will look huge and $1000 not out of the question.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 10:04:02'] Not a terrible idea although the premium gained seems low for a credit spread on such a volatile stock.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 10:26:38'] To back up your trade, using tastyworks shows this is more than 1 std dev out so looking good, and they have a 85% chance of profit. However, this is after their earnings date of Feb 3, so there could be huge swings at that time. Should stabilize by Feb 19th, but usually those dates are ones to avoid having within your short time window.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 10:58:04'] TSLA IV Percentile is at 19% meaning it’s higher than it’s been for only 19% of the last 365 days.  And earning are coming up so IV is going to shoot up.  Terribly trade IMO.  You’d likely be able to get double, maybe triple the premium if you made this trade a day before earnings.  It will probably be fine if you hold until expiration but it’s going to be a roller coaster and you’re going to have 910$ tied up in it until then.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 12:26:24'] Just buy shares of tesla, it'll go up 10% in a month. and there's not NEARLY as much risk involved in that as this.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 12:40:04'] Very risky, Tesla valuation transcends time and space.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 15:34:15'] I'm personally going to say I like this trade. I don't like betting against Tesla but the top is near imo. To hit those numbers in about a month would be astounding but with Tesla you never know. However I think you'll be fine. Also, just my personal thing but 10% in a month is fantastic! If you could have a high probability trade and make 10% I just about a month, who wouldn't like it? I guess people don't like the pennies in front of a steam roller thing but if the trade starts going against you, you have a chance to adjust and not lose all of your collateral. I think it's a good trade and I'll be back on expiration to see how well you did. Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 11:21:15'] Honestly I don't know if I would do this. I saw tsla short sellers lost more money than the entire US airline industry this year. I wouldn't do it man.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 11:34:28'] if you only wanted 10% return, why didn't you just do a weekly, expiring this Friday at $790/$800? Why risk $1k and have your collateral locked for 1.5 month when you can make the same amount with similar risk (both .15ish delta). I'd take my chances with shorter term play with TSLA than anything over 1 month til exp. If it breaches close to your short strike, then you can always roll it over to next week, possible at a higher strike for credit
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 12:01:49'] I would say better to do a short strangle but wait at least until the week of 22nd when the ImpVol has picked up and reaches its peak before the report that way you will have an idea where the stock itself is and what you can expect it to do, but more importantly you will have a ImpVol crash the days/week after so even if you are wrong on the price level you will gain on the ImpVol and exit when the vols starts to come down.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 13:07:50'] It will probably work but isn't the safer play to sell puts when it comes to TSLA?  Take another look at the chart. There have been a lot more unrealistic surprises to the upside than down. At least, selling put spreads is how I have been playing it. Waiting for a month or so before I play Tesla at all though after the crazy snp inclusion run.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 13:08:22'] How many such credit spreads did you sell? Why did you choose these particular strikes and expiry?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 13:14:53'] Hey I think this is a sweet trade with good RR ratios. are you though planning on holding through expiration or selling after some time decay kicks in and you can buy it back for cheaper? it's hard to see Tesla rallying to 1000 in the next month. I think 6 months is more reasonable... &#x200B;I like this trader considering you're neither shorting it, or getting a risky call... just taking advantage of time decay

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 18:32:29'] Maybe pick a shorter exp and do it multiple times over 46 days so you can adjust the strikes and have theta work for you
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 18:54:07'] It’s fine and safe just stay small. You’ll find the first 30-40% will come quickly and the remainder will take longer closer maturity. With that said, making $40-$90 is not that great over the course of time. And then if you size up that’s where the risk amplifies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 19:29:26'] Curious to see how it plays out
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 19:47:40'] Why not bet that it doesn’t fall by a certain date? I think that is safer with TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-04 21:51:05'] This is a good approach. Even I sell CC on TSLA. Used to apply a 2 week expiration and upwards strike of 150 on the current stock price. But it has been very risky since with high IV, it goes upto 40 (avg) per day some times. Have updated my approach to taking upwards of 200 in strike and 2-week expiration.

In this case I think it's had an incredible run lately and adding another 33% to the stock price is very unlikely in the next 46 days.1000%+ loss if TSLA is above your strike though (versus premium received).33% in 46 days sounds like it isnt much by TSLA standards.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-05 10:31:24'] Wouldn't bet against Tesla. Much easy ways to make 10% gain.Just sell credit spreads on SPY for the closest expiration date...target 2-8% return for each credit spread depending on where SPY is trading.  They have expirations on Mon, Wed, and Friday.  So it is super easy to make 10% in a week using this method.  Example: sell a $380 call on SPY and buy a $381 call on SPY....with 1/8 expiration.  You can get 10% return on that.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 21:15:11'] I have a question regarding bullish diagonal spreads using long/short call options.  This ticker is trading at $4.50.Lets say you buy an ITM call for $3 strike price a month out.   Then, you sell an OTM call for $5 strike price expiring this week.  Two things can occur (If I understand this correctly):  Thing A. The OTM call expires OTM and you keep the premium, and your ITM callsThing B. The OTM call expires ITM and you then automatically buy shares at $3, then sell them at $5.   So you keep the premium and the price difference between $3 and $5 share prices, minus what you paid for the ITM call correct?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 19:14:09'] Came across a fairly basic strategy that I wanted some input on.Revolves around covered calls and we'll use Apple as the example stock here.Step 1: Buy 100 shares of Apple (let's say $165/share)Step 2: Sell to Open a call with a strike price of $170 expiring next week with a premium of $75.Step 3: Let the option expire regardless of stock price movement.Step 4 if the option expires worthless: Pocket the premium and place another covered call for next weekStep 4 of the option is exercised: Pocket premium and buy another 100 shares (can get tricky if price went way up) or find another, cheaper stock to do this with.Is there any downside to this strategy outside of the stock price plummeting and being left bag holding? And even then is bag holding a stock like Apple a bad thing?I understand the stock price going way up can be viewed as a downside but you'd still get your premium and sell at a higher price than what you bought it so you'd still be making money just not as much.

I was paid more than that too.So even in the worst price scenario, if AMC goes to 0, I would have been paid more than the loss I would incur.I don't know what other things can happen, such as bankruptcy of the company or some other disaster.Could someone help me with this?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 14:09:20'] Bit of a beginner question. Say I’m trading some kind of spread like a butterfly. I understand how the max loss is calculated, but do I need to make any consideration in case one of the puts I sold is exercised? I.e. say the net cost is $100 for a butterfly, if the stock is trading at $50, do I need to have $5000 mentally “set aside” in case one of the puts is exercised? Or would the broker automatically exercise one of my calls to cover it? I know that’s kind of a basic question, I can draw the diagram on paper but having trouble wrapping my head around how it would actually play out in practice
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 15:54:05'] I'm getting a little confused with equivalent positions.If buying a put and selling a call both result for you to SELL SHARES if ITM, does that mean you can lock in profits by buying a put just like you can with selling a call?  You buy at $5, price goes up to $10, you sell a $6 call to lock in profits plus a little extra.  Price closes at $11.  You sell at $6 plus keep premium.  The opposite of this doesn't work.  How would buying a put lock in profits?  They both require you to SELL SHARES though if ITM so are they similar?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 15:57:22'] My previous question brings me to my second question:Can you (actually, is it smart) sell a call to lock in profits?Pretend you buy a stock at $6.  Price goes up to $10!  You could sell it for a $4 gain.  Or, you could sell at $7 call for at least $3 plus premium.  This means if price expires at $10, you would make little more compared to if you had sold for $10.  Of course, if price keeps going up you won't make as much as if you had held.  Anyway, this is a demonstrable strategy, right?Or, if you perform this, and then price drops back down to $6, you get to keep all the money additionally you still have the stock.  Seems like a quite decent strategy if you want to still hold the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-04 16:02:50'] Last question.Is there such thing a a short covered straddle?Pretend you're trying to lower your cost as much as possible, so you buy at $10.  There's a lot of volatility, so you sell a $12 call (more money) and a $9 put (more money).  You don't care about getting more shares if it expires ITM.  If price closes over $12, you are fine selling and keeping the money from the put.  This seems like a way to lower your price no matter what happens, they can't both be ITM, so you can, if the put expires ITM, either get more shares with someone else'e money (marginally paid for with the covered call) or if the call expires ITM, sell your shares AND keep the money from the put.  Or, if price is in between, you get all the money from the call and the put and will not get any new shares.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 06:05:29'] Hello! I'm doing some research on selling far OTM ICs on SPX or /ES over SPY, and I like how SPX works because I don't have to worry about assignment and the taxes are better. However, I'm looking at /ES, and while I appreciate the extended hours and volume, I don't really understand how futures like this are "physically" settled. Obviously of you sell a put for, idk, futures oranges, then you need to actually buy oranges or whatever, but what does that mean for /ES? And what does quarterly cash settlement *mean*? I've tried reading about it but I can't quite grasp it. If I get assigned on a 4065 put for /ES, and it's *not* cash settled, then is that 100... units(?)... of ES? Or 40,650?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 09:04:37'] I have 400 shares of TSLA in my Roth IRA. Does it make sense to place covered calls at far out strike prices to make some tax free income on the side? For example, right now if I placed a covered call at a strike price of $210 expiring at the end of next week 4/14, I could make about $50 and it would expire worthless as long as TSLA didn't jump 15%. I could do this 4 times since I have 400 shares and make about $200 every 2 weeks which would be $5,200/year tax free.I understand TSLA is quite volatile and there is definitely some risk that it jumps way over 15% in a two week span and I miss out on those gains since my contract would be exercised but outside of that is this a sound strategy? Or I am missing an important detail?

Specifically, I sell lots of puts and I realized that when I exported my Robinhood 1099 to Turbotax the cost basis for all of my puts was marked as 0. On every page, Turbotax gave me a "are you sure this should be $0 cost basis?" message, but I don't know what the actual cost basis on a put that was never assigned should be?

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 20:12:15'] Here’s my take - I don’t like betting against Larry Ellison - smart man . Second a double top on an options expiration Friday  is not really of itself a reason to jump in. Impulsive move. Oracle has pivoted into cloud software and integrated multi cloud enterprise usage. 98% of companies now conduct themselves this way. Not a good reason to put .It’s at 107 today you need 100 to be at the money The underlying equity is on the move right now - they don’t make big swings on earnings but enough to mess up your trade . Sell this trade it’s too iffy , Theta ticking , you bought on a Friday so you already lost a weekend plus - NEVER buy an option  on a Friday . It’s at 107 today 107.40 after hours . You have time but , if they get a good or decent earnings , ( Jeffries just gave them an upgrade) you might find yourself at 112 trying to get under 100. The trade moved the wrong way already - cut and run . “ either you take care of the business or the business takes  care of you” Tony SopranoRemember the golden rules from Wall Street  “I don’t like losses, sport. Nothing ruins my day more than losses.”Say you had to average a gain of $1,000 a day to make budget. If you lose $1,000 one day, then you have to make $3,000 the next day just to get back on track. That requires you to take on more risk than what might suit your trading style, leaving you more vulnerable to bigger losses.Being “patient,” until the market does what it’s “supposed” to do, often doesn’t work. It’s better to cut and start over, than let losses ride.And the idea that you have to be “in it to win it” is for suckers who haven’t learned that it’s better to be square — have no position — than to stay in for no other reason..“First lesson in business is: Don’t get emotional about stock, clouds your judgement.”Easier said than done, but this might be the quote that rings the most true, and about more than just the financial markets.When analyzing the decisions that led to losses, I found most of them were suffered after the trade was entered. And behind most bad decisions was some form of emotion; in most cases, the emotion was pride.Being too stubborn to cut a position, not wanting to be criticized for potentially buying at the high or selling at the low, taking profit/cutting a loss too early, wanting to show everyone else that they were wrong, etc., were among the emotions behind many bad decisions.Gordon Gekko

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 11:28:01'] Your first two examples have bid sizes of 13 and 5, and the third has a 129.  Ask size goes from 4 to 60.If you are trying to unload a large position of something that isn't very liquid, you may have to ask for a lower price to entice buyers. Unlike futures, options are not closely tied to the stock price.For some illiquid options, I've seen my limit order as the ask or bid price occasionally throughout the day.  The ask may be .60 and I put in a limit for .80.  Occasionally, it may shoot up to .80 as I am the only one offering to sell shares before diving back down because of another orders. This limit order may stay up all day before getting filled at the end by someone looking to gobble up a bunch at whatever reasonable price they can.  I traded 3 REIT calls this way once and came out $60 higher despite the stock price and the options prices not moving for 3 weeks. My limit order required someone to buy them higher than the usual market rate, and whoever was looking to buy whatever they could get had to spend a little more to get mine.
	COMMENT: ['2021-09-22 17:36:15'] first of all, iv crush is not the reason, it is the consequence of pricing dropping, as iv is just calculated from the price. So, by definition, if price drops, with other factors unchanged (or changed in the other direction), iv must crush too. As u/spxbull  said, deltaPNL and vega PNL explain the price drops pretty accurately.So the question is, why price drops. While I also see cases mentioned by u/Ideal_Pancake, but clearly it is not the case here, because 1. as you mentioned, both bid and ask drop, 2. they actually got filled, a lot 3. it has a large oi, so pretty liquid.The reason any price drops is because more people are selling, no difference here. Someone is selling a lot of this options in these 3 minutes.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 01:32:18'] My system shows no position with such strike. Only 950 and 960 are tradable.A long call with such long expiration time and such high strike shows that you don't trust your investment. It's like gambling. If you think the price will rise why not selling an in the money put? This depends on your margin.This option costs around 17,500 USD for strike 960 USD and with very large spread. Break even is at 1,135 USD. An ITM short put with same strike gives you an income of around 42,000 USD. Break even is 540 USD.Conclusion:If you buy a call you will earn your first Dollar at an price of 1,135.If you sell a put with same strike you will loose money at 540 USD  and below.Profit/Loss Diagrams:Long Call: [https://i.imgur.com/kTbIU6z.png](https://i.imgur.com/kTbIU6z.png)Short Put: [https://i.imgur.com/yW5jmJr.png](https://i.imgur.com/yW5jmJr.png)My decision: TSLA is a high risky investment. It's good for gambling. If you want to be on safe side sell OTM Puts. At current price level a strike of 520 USD (one standard deviation away) and expiration date of June 17th you would earn about 1,750 USD. If you think it's still too risky an 400 USD OTM Put with same expiration date gives you 420 USD.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 06:43:52'] It's dirt cheap because it's unlikely to be profitable, much like the lottery... but just like the lottery, the reward has the *potential* to be very high, if you're lucky. Since it's a pretty low price, you could just try it as a learning experience (If you buy the option, you can't lose more than what you paid). Then, watch the price go up or down as the stock moves and watch the Greeks to understand what's causing the price fluctuations (mostly gamma and vaga, in this case).  A single gap up at opening might be enough to double your money, while a couple mostly uneventful days might slash the price in half.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 12:02:46'] Start with a cheap vertical spread and watch it to see what happens. You'll learn more by playing with it. Tesla is good to try because it's volatile and the bid ask spreads are small
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 00:59:51'] TSLA moving up and down 100 points isn’t anything new but the overall market has been in a downtrend since the beginning of the year. TSLA going up 300 points in a month will need a lot of bullish momentum. Don’t think that is happening soon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-21 04:15:40'] You should not be making any trades as you clearly don’t understand enough yet. Paper trade for a year and you will get a better understanding.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-25 18:07:15'] Hey guys, I am pretty new here so I can’t post but I want to ask about how I lost money on my Netflix strangle with a huge price drop after the earning call.So I bought 500 put and 600 call on 4/20 when Netflix stock price was 550. 500 put costs 2.42 and 600 call costs 3.5 with expiration date 4/23. During the after hours of that day, Netflix dropped to 500 which is almost 10%. Next day, my 600 call goes to almost 0 and my 500 put rises to around 4.5 which is almost the all time high of the day. So in total I am still losing money because what I earned from my put does not cover the loss of my call.From my understanding, straddle works best when there is a significant move of the stock price, no matter it is moving up or down. But in this scenario, I lost money with such a big price movement.I consulted a friend and he brings up an idea that iv crush could be the reason. But this would happen for all companies who will do an earning call so does it mean this straddle strategy will not work fine in this situation?

This week has been wild,  even the donkies playing at the white house didn't affect it much.  Crazy. It has to have a *healthy* pull-back sometime, the higher it goes without testing any below support is risky IMO. Good luck!:)

What makes you think it cannot go up another 15-17% in over a month?At least you took a spread, I am simply faulting your logic behind it. The market can be irrational longer than you can be solvent.

I was proud that I managed to roll it up once, but as TSLA kept rising, and theta kept doing it's thing, I got to the point this week where I could no longer roll it up OR out and finally closed it before expiration at the loss of about $1300.  I've learned to NEVER bet against TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 09:04:01'] I love seeing dips under $800.   Very risky but I immediately buy $800 calls.   Pricey but today prime example.  Bought 10. $800 same day exp calls @2.75.   10:35am.   Currently sitting @$8.30.     I never bet against this stock.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 08:23:49'] This didn't last long... back above 800. IMHO wouldn't bet against tesla long run. Maybe quick in and out shorts, but unless you have experience day trading tesla and have a lot of capital then I would stay away. Or if there's a huge dip in BTC... but that's a whole other massive bull to bet against for now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 10:11:17'] When I read that TSLA purchased Bitcoin it signaled, to me, that the Chinese market will be huge for Musk. Many affluent Chinese use Bitcoin to protect their assets and make real estate and other purchases discretely and privately.  I know there are a ton of Chinese EV companies, but in China there is a cache around foreign luxury goods that won’t ever go away.Also, with Biden in the White House, relations with China will improve drastically.I think TSLA is making a pivot most US companies started make nearly 15-20 years ago and I don’t see anything negative about it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 08:24:56'] I’m very bullish on TSLA I’m just wondering with all the moves (his brother selling and BTC action), is it making investors a little worried? Hence, the dip this week
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 12:25:41'] Tesla has to start delivering product. Good Quality Product. Elon knows it's only a matter of time before people start to go: "Hey, why is Tesla so high, but they only make 100,000 cars a year? Where's my ROI? Shouldn't I be getting sweet dividends if it's this pricy? Where's the truck? Where's the Semi? Where's Roadster2?" Because of the high value, Tesla is finally in a position of financial comfort. This has fortunately killed off most of the shorts. But if the stock goes down to an area that other car makers occupy $50-100 all that "free money" disappears. So currently Musk is doing what he always does when he gets in a pinch. Try to distract. "Hey look! We're playing with bitcoin! Lolz!" You've noticed that the stock isn't shooting up like a meteor right? So as long as it trades sideways it's fine. But if people start selling to get their money back - that's when there will be a problem. This is why Berlin and Texas are being built with all speed possible - taking the cash and putting it toward production, if they can get production volume higher that will secure the business because then they can go: "Well we are making Semis and Trucks in Texas, Model 3, Y and S in Berlin, Model 3 & Y in China, Model S, and 3 in Nevada). This is also why he's asked Biden for a carbon tax, he hopes to sell credits for financing operations. Although bitcoin runs counter to those efforts. That stupid thing now uses as much power as Argentina.   TLDR: This is the high wire act right now. Tesla's in this financially comfortable position but has to start showing results. If it stays in this range it's fine. Elon want to prevent withdrawals because once the stock starts falling it could drop precipitously. I'm not saying this would be the end, but it is the end of the unabated upward motion it had been enjoying. $1200 will be a real slog, not like before the split.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 14:29:39'] Never bet against Tesla. I'm dying get my hands on one and not any other electric vehicle. Not even an electric Porsche. I want his wacky tech and and vision of the future. GM might go electric, but it will still have boring cars.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 09:33:31'] Yes. It is. I'm a believer in the NOPE hypothesis, that no one is naturally buying shares only options. The minute this goes sideways for an extended period, well...Anyway, TSLA has traded sideways for a month now and appears to be in a slow decline. The minute people stop buying bullish calls this thing will drop like a lead balloon.Now if the hope lasts until the next stimulus check, it probably will get another 1-2 month leg up to 1k before it crashes.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 14:51:49'] > TSLA is this the beginning of the end? A couple things to keep in mind before you dump your calls/shares:&#x200B;* Pelosi is speaker of the house.* Pelosi's husband bought between 500k to a million $ of TSLA calls in December that expire in 2022.Pelosi has a pretty strong grasp on policy within the democrat party, and likely has a good amount of influence on 'how green' this country will be heading in the next couple years. There will probably be dips along the way for TSLA, but very unlike to be the beginning of a long term decline. Personally I think they still have a long way up to go.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 14:59:30'] Try betting against Elon Musk 😂.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 15:15:24'] If you are a long term investor and you’ve done your homework, you would see how saturated the car market was in the 20th century (tons of automakers) but only 3 (Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler) had over 70% of the total market cap (total sales of all cars sold in America). If you apply the same logic and the idea that history repeats itself, you would see that Tesla will have a huge piece of the EV pie in the next coming years. As we saw with $GME and $AMC, we saw how some stocks completely depart from fundamentals due to market makers and institutions. However, most institutions that invest in Tesla have continued to support it due to what Tesla has been able to achieve and what it plans to achieve in the future. As long as they keep selling more cars and Elon Musk doesn’t get shot by oil executives, to answer your question, no it’s not the beginning of the end. Especially with the new wave of stimulus checks, more money will inflate the price of stocks these next few weeks. The correction we saw with Tesla is healthy because stocks that have too much bullish momentum tend to crash if they don’t consolidate. Hold and buy the dip!!! (Note: Note financial advice)

The battery is more important then the “ car “.   A car is obsolete as we know it it will be a device that brings humans from point a to point b.

All I know is that this company hasn't turned a profit in its entire history without government assistance. And now that every other car manufacturer are cranking out their own EVs, it's just a matter of time that Tesla's first mover advantage comes to an end. I'm also tickled that this bubble stock invested in a bubble currency. It's like bubble squared. But the Fed can probably inflate it longer than anyone expects. We'll see what happens.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 16:24:13'] Keep an eye on old cars. The batteries in the first batch of mass produced cars are about to go bad -- NOT a production issue, it's just the nature of lithium ion batteries. They can only last for at most 8 years. Look out for how they handle the replacement cost/recycling. That will determine the future of $TSLA. The trend might indeed reverse if consumers have to drop a 5-figure every 5 to 8 years.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 18:29:17'] Here’s the update on what happened with insider trading which IMO created an over exaggerated selling of shares .. Short lived an once digested imo it will resume on the upward trend . UPDATE: Elon Musk's brother Kimbal just sold some Tesla stock. Is he calling a top?7:42 am ET February 12, 2021 (MarketWatch) PrintClaudia Assis, and Tomi KilgoreKimbal Musk sells shares while Vanguard increases stake and another board member makes nearly $119 million on his tradesA few Tesla Inc. insiders have had a busy couple of days this week, including one investor who is close to Chief Executive Elon Musk and again showing some good timing in his trades.That's Elon Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, a Tesla (TSLA) board member and entrepreneur, who sold $25.56 million in shares (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musks-brother-kimbal-sells-256-million-of-tesla-stock-2021-02-11) in the open market this week with all the trades made above $850, according to a filing (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000149473121000001/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml).The last time Kimbal Musk sold shares of the electric-vehicle maker, he also exercised options to buy the same amount, just at a much lower price. At the time, Kimbal Musk's sales seemed to mark a high for the stock for more than 2 1/2 months.Kimbal Musk's timing was good this week, too. He sold his 30,000 shares on Feb. 9 in a series of trades at a weighted-average price of $852.117, according to a MarketWatch analysis of SEC data. The stock opened that day at $855.12 and traded in an intraday range of $859.80 to $841.75, before closing at $849.46.On Wednesday, the stock (TSLA) dropped 5.3%, with an intraday high of just $844.82. It rose 0.9% on Thursday, but, at $811.66, it was still well below where Kimbal Musk sold his shares.Here are Kimbal Musk's trades:-- Sold: 7,971 shares at $850.277 (weighted average)-- Sold: 11,409 shares at $851.452-- Sold: 1,983 shares at $852.243-- Sold: 3,482 shares at $853.767-- Sold 3,415 shares at $854.805-- Sold: 1,140 shares at $855.927-- Sold: 600 shares at $856.676After the sales, Kimbal Musk still owned 599,740 Tesla common shares, or about 0.06% of the shares outstanding. His remaining stake is worth about $486.8 million shares at Thursday's close.Tesla's stock has run up 97.1% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 index has gained 10.7%.Vanguard increases stake to be the second largest shareholderWhile Kimbal sold, the Vanguard Group disclosed that it owned 57.81 million shares (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/102909/000110465921019218/tv01960-teslainc.htm), or 6.1% of the outstanding shares, according to an SEC filing Wednesday.That makes Vanguard the second largest shareholder, behind Elon Musk at about 18% and ahead of Capital Research & Management Co. at 5.5%, according to FactSet.That means Vanguard recently bought about 14.53 million Tesla shares, as the fund manager had previously disclosed that it owned 43.28 million shares, or 4.4% of the shares outstanding, as of Sept. 30. Prices paid for the shares were not disclosed.Board member Antonio Gracias makes a pretty penny trading Tesla sharesn another SEC filing late Wednesday (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000149515821000001/xslF345X03/edgardoc.xml), Tesla disclosed that private-equity investor Antonio Gracias, a longtime Tesla board member and close to Elon Musk, acquired earlier this week a total of 150,747 shares at a weighted average price of $58.149 through the exercising of derivative securities.On Feb. 9, the same day Kimbal Musk sold his stock, the filing shows Gracias sold 150,747 shares in a series of trades. He didn't do as well as Kimbal Musk, however, as he sold his shares at a weighted average price of $846.591.Still, Gracias made $118.86 million on the trades.Here are the Gracias's trades:-- Acquired: 97,000 shares at $52.38-- Acquired: 53,747 shares at $68.56-- Sold: 1,930 shares at $842.596 (weighted average)-- Sold: 13,256 shares at $843.51-- Sold: 22,036 shares at $844.372-- Sold: 22,122 shares at $845.364-- Sold: 19,320 shares at $846.381-- Sold: 19,039 shares at $847.36-- Sold: 34,023 shares at $848.404-- Sold: 18,588 shares at $849.32-- Sold: 433 shares at $850.346After the trade, Gracias owned 2,545 common Tesla shares.Steve Goldstein contributed to this report.-Claudia Assis; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com	(END) Dow Jones NewswiresFebruary 12, 2021 07:42 ET (12:42 GMT)Copyright (c) 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 21:58:48'] Tesla just invested in to Bitcoin so it diversified their market cap and their books accordingly. 1.5 billion is not some small number so it’s no longer a cash or deferred asset Tesla Holds. However they are betting on the utility of ownership with a property that doesn’t work against or with inflation. The value of the American currency is the main fear and concern here so that’s a major reason why Bitcoin is being snacked up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 22:05:58'] Real competition is finally coming for TSLA.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 11:29:47'] Tesla typically trade sideways to down post earnings for a bit.  Its rebuilding the base.  But we have 2 gigafactories coming online this that can double last years production.  I have calls but have been interested in spreads.  I just dont feel like I k ow what Im doing enough with options to do much more than calls.If you think teslas overvalued you have to look at the companies worth 1/10th to 1/100th of tesla value with ZERO production.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 08:26:09'] I’m wondering the same thing. I’m a little concerned about buying today and holding over the long weekend. If the market opens weak on Tuesday I think it’ll be a good buying opportunity then. I am sitting on the sidelines on Tesla for now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-12 23:10:19'] Tesla is a bubble. Don't get me wrong, I love the company and the cars and almost worked there (wish I had now purely for the stocks) but it is overvalued. Even if you account for every possible bull case you could ever contrive for this company, Tesla is still overvalued. It might not happen this month, or even six months from now, but eventually Tesla's value is going to return to fundamentals. Everyone thinks they're bulletproof and a genius in a bubble. But Tesla's p/e ratio is >10x Amazon's. It will crash, and hard, eventually. I'll be ready to buy in when it does, but for now I'm buying cheap otm puts every month and waiting for it to collapse. There's gonna be lots of people who say 'this wont age well' and 'youre just a hater', but take some advice from Buffett and Graham - fundamentals ALWAYS matter. In the end, it's always about that. And Tesla simply doesn't have fundamentals to support the value it's at. FMV IMO is $80-100 or maybe, maybe up to $150 if you're super bullish and assume every possible thing goes right for them and somehow robotaxis are the future. But to answer the question yes/no. Nobody can time it, but this bubble will pop.

Worst case scenario is Im left with $200,000 and a bag of worthless Tesla right? I admit this idea has come up in light of rising rates.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 03:36:13'] DO NOT SELL LONG EXPIRING SHORT CALLS.  Theta decay is mostly in the last eight weeks of a call, and that is where your benefit is located.  You make more on 24 monthly short calls, than 1 two-year short call.  Choose DELTA as your indicator of distance from at the money.   You will sell your shares at expiration, and shorter expirations allow you to sell sooner, than later.   Options are rarely exercised before expiration.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 12:00:14'] " I have 1,154 shares of TSLA"  &#x200B;congrats. i hate you out of envy
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 12:07:45'] Selling LEAPS is generally pretty bad
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 13:09:43'] You gotta ask yourself a simple question. If you did NOT own 1154 shares of Tesla, would you be enticed to sell a naked put on it?If the answer is NO, then don't do it, as it is the same exact position.You are better advised to establish a collar around Tesla, selling a call and buying an OTM put.  The put can be cheaper and further out. Since you are in it for the long haul, NO MATTER where Tesla goes over the next couple of years, just keep reestablishing the collar every month/week. With effective execution and paying some attention to certain adjustments,  you can reduce your basis on Tesla to a very low dollar amount if not nothing. This way your downside and upside are both limited, but since you immediately reestablish it, and since you are receiving a credit each time (makes sense to lose more on the downside as you were initially bullish on the stock, but that does not really matter if you are sharp enough), you are effectively reducing your cost basis on Tesla.So basically I am just asking you to write the same call, but add a further otm put. If the call gets past it's strike, close the position and re-establish the collar. Same for the downside. But instead of a leap, we are working with weekly's and monthly's.If you are ready to put some work in, and read up a little, you might as well net a whole million of this over the next two or three years, instead of netting 200 k and undertaking the FULL downside risk. It's worth a shot and you are getting paid five fold for your efforts with a reduction in total risk. Hedge funds dont use collars, because the hedge fund industry is ultra competitive, and if the past ten years of below par gains are any indication, fund managers have and always will, look for homeruns to catch the attention. A limited downside and a limited upside is too boring for them.(That last para is more tongue-in-cheek then anything else, something I read, can't vouch for it).
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 14:04:27'] If you want to sell your shares at $1000/share in two years, then fine.  Your break even would be Tesla being around $1200/share.Personally unless you absolutely have to have cash right now to spend...I think it’s not a good play.  TSLA could be worth $2000/share by then.  You just don’t know.  Better to sell quarterly call options which after doing it 8 times over 2 years will yield you more than 200,000 AND give you more control over your shares.Definitely what I would do
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 13:12:13'] Ask the guy who sold leaps two years ago if he has any regrets
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 11:12:12'] I have also considered doing this with my Tesla shares, but just seems very risky to sell a Leap CC. I have been selling weeklies/monthlies instead.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 12:37:40'] If you have 1,000+ shares of Tesla, you should not be coming to reddit for advice. Consult a professional.. not a bunch of anonymous people that have no bearing on your failure or success.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 11:23:07'] I feel like selling 45 DTE between 30 and 40 deltas would be a better long term premium gain but that's just me. I think it would bother me if Tesla ripped up and I was stuck with the shares till 2023
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 11:17:07'] maybe sell certain %, not whole 11. This way if Tesla moons you wouldn't regret it so much.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 13:12:02'] That's a pretty long time to hold the calls, but I suppose you could buy them back after some theta burns off.   What about selling Jan 21/2022 C900 instead for $120.  Seems like a better deal to me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 13:08:15'] That's a long time on a call for a stock as volatile as TSLA.  Lot can happen between now and 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 16:51:14'] You'd be happy to sell TSLA for $1000 RIGHT now.  Trust me when it hits $1000 before your strike price you will change your mind, you will wish u never sold those calls.  Been down the same road on a much smaller scale.  Sold TIGR $35 covered calls and bought in at 21.  When it hit 37 i was mad at myself for selling those.  Same with FUBO was selling 35 calls and i bought shares at 15.  When it hit 60 i was pissed off.  Thought selling covered calls was easy.  Its not.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 12:12:48'] Risky to sell a LEAP covered call. You risk losing your entire profit if Tesla drops. One idea: consider selling covered calls on a weekly or monthly basis. I've been doing this with Netflix for about 6 months, and the average monthly premium is probably around $1300. Consider what you could do with $1300In the Roth tax free deployed in a monthly dollar cost average strategy in an s&p etf over the time from now until the leap exp date in 2023.  Yes you risk getting the shares called away. The skill in the strategy is choosing strike prices that will be almost in the money but never get called away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 14:17:01'] Sell weeklies! One reason being that you’re in a non taxable account so if you actually do get called away, you can just buy them again without any tax consequences
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 15:16:10'] Don’t. I’m stuck in a position for 13 months because of a roll that got out of control, fleeing ITM strikes with a CC. If you are ok with selling at the strike, I’d stick to a strategy that allows you to collect smaller premiums more often. Say you collect premium four times and get exercised on the fourth. There are a number of benefits to this approach, namely, you can change your mind after each successive CC expiration (close it before expiration no matter what).
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 12:40:07'] Just sell 30 DTE
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 16:29:42'] It’s okay. Works out to be 10%/yr premium on capital. I wouldn’t do it though. Selling further OTM more frequently should give you a decent amount. Maybe not as much as leaps but then you’re okay if stock goes up. You can adjust your calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 17:17:08'] The contract high was 361 last month. Essentially half of your cast basis....I would push the button starting on the next run....maybe get 300K off the covered calls, a 1.1M if it gets called in 2 years. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me. Thats a double 750K move in two years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:08:53'] Rates just dropped
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:52:13'] Here is an ideas. Sell 154 of those shares and buy the leaps. Reduce those 1000 shares to 200 shares. Then buy Apple, Zillow, SQ and some of ARK funds which will give you a good mix. Then you don’t have to worry about collecting  200k.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 19:25:51'] I wish I can even  buy 1 share of Tesla. Whatever you did man I  admire you
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 23:55:00'] Another approach: Staggering the contracts in 6 month intervals, 6, 12, 18, 24 would avoid all or nothing scenario, increase time decay. Also Laddering Strike from 900-1050 in 50 point increments.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 12:57:17'] Rule 3 & 5 bro
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 11:04:24'] Wouldn't the total premium just be $2,200 with an additional 200 if the 11 calls got called away?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 15:09:42'] It sounds pretty reasonable though. Collecting 200000 now and +285 per share at expiry if they even reach 1000. It also puts the stocks to work instead of them just sitting there conforming  to the whims of the stock market. Giving you a reasonable cushion if they do just go down the drain. But I’m also fairly new to options so my advice definitely should be taken with a grain of salt.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 13:55:41'] You would at least missed out on 700k that’s assuming tesla will go to 2k by that time. It all depens on how you use that 200k premium
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 17:24:42'] I got some confirmation bias for you I have 100 shares of Amazon at 2900 and just sold a one year covered call for 530 at 3400 same idea as you seems impossible to lose on to tell the truth restricting my gains but sealing a instant 20% gain plus another possible 20% for future. Would have to go nine hundred up buy January to break even for the opposing side so I’m confident in it. Sounds like a good idea on your part as well free capital is always good and liquid plus a sure fire extra 90 if it does go in the money. Anybody speaking it down is a fool. But this isn’t advice

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 15:54:42'] I don't know about the tax situation. But that sounds too good to be true. Also, I would personally just sell shorter term covered calls. But that's just my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 15:57:18'] Here’s an idea, for every call you sell you can buy an equal value put so if it crashes you can sell at a better price and then rebuy low. Kind of an arbitrage play but if it works it works. If not it just goes back up
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 16:15:55'] that's a long time to have your shares covered.  if TSLAl/the market dives you will have to unwind before you can get out, etc.in theory, great play, but selling leaps always makes me nervous
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 16:29:46'] Perfect advanced strategy that people forget about!!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 17:02:48'] One big downside is you cannot sell them while you haver the covered call in place. You lock your shares in place. Do the math on up and down....950, and 1050. You might be better selling at a higher strike price. Not a taxable event...and tax free if it is in your Roth. Taxable upon withdrawal for the 401K.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 17:05:20'] As I suspected....you could make 175K on the 1200 calls. Or an even better deal 120K on the 1500 calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 17:07:59'] You can make so much more selling extremely out of the money CCs 45 DTE... like under 10 delta..
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 17:10:16'] This brings in a very interesting trade as the long options are way expensive or lucrative. You can buy 100 shares of Tesla at 67,500 and sell a covered call for 20,000. Am I right or wrong?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:07:39'] Would love to sell calls against my position to collect premiums between now and when it hits $1k! Great game plan. If you are forced to exercise at some point. You could then start selling puts at strike you like again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:10:39'] If you own this much tsla stock I hope you’re bullish. In this case I would recommend selling monthlies at about .2 delta. This can increase if you’re not as bullish on any given month or decrease if you are. The monthly premium will not cap your upside quite as much. I wouldn’t recommend selling a LEAP this far out unless you are not bullish on the underlying. Good luck! Cries in 15 TSLA shares at $550.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:11:17'] Generally selling leap is not profitable compare to short term cover call, Specially for fast growing stock.  Buy the leap if Tesla dipped and sell one or two months cover call.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:33:49'] I am bullish about TSLA long-term, but considering TSLA stock price outpaced revenue growth by 2000% in the last 12 months, I hesitate to be excessively bullish in shorter-term recommendations to those with a nice profit in their stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:41:48'] Sell shorter months and buy longer months. Isn’t that the general rule? Someone correct me if I’m wrong. Given that theta decays so much quicker on shorter term options, wouldn’t it make sense for you to sell monthly premiums? It’s an IRA anyway, no tax consequences.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:43:49'] 1154 shares of tsla. Flexing?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:50:13'] I personally never sell leap covered call but I buy leap calls. If you are planning to make $500 from tesla in two years that pretty low rewards compare to the risk. If I had 1100 tsla stocks I would probably do mix of monthly and weekly. If you don't want manage it then monthly and quarterly. For example:3 calls monthly, 4 more calls 3 months from now and 3 more weekly this way I'm monitoring tsla stocks and selling calls when market in my favor. All stocks goes up drop consolidate then up again. I want to take advantage of this trend and not sell too many calls when stocks going up violently which is possible for tsla that in 1 month $300 move.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 18:58:17'] Great Job on how well you've done on your retirements account.  Another way to look at it, if you sell covered calls at a premium of $200.00, if you bought back at $150 you made $50,000.Not a bad option either!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 19:04:17'] Owning that many shares of tesla and being able to sell monthlies is the absolute dream
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 19:48:29'] I’m still a beginning trader and trying to learn options, and man do I envy y’all. I can’t even imagine having a portfolio so great, literally I work fast food and have $300 in the market overall and have mostly lost money. Granted I’m only 19 and don’t have much money to really grow off but man if I can turn my $300 into a thousand that would be an achievement for me. If anything from how much money I’ve invested overall I haven’t even really gained money cuz I suck at knowing when to sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 19:51:15'] Terrible time to sell CC's. I'd at least wait until TSLA price comes back. Also think you are selling way too low. By March 2023 $1k a share will be giving them away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 19:56:47'] That’s too long of a contract in my opinion. I also write covered calls but like to maintain the position just so I can keep writing new contracts and collect the premium, so having a contract open this long, and with TSLA’s appreciation history, it wouldn’t be unlikely for you to get called away. Only once got my 400 shares called away and I was pissed because now can’t write new calls and the price point took off. I’ll check the options chain and if I see a better opportunity for you I’ll come back here.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 20:02:55'] Why sell leaps? Why not sell covered calls or secured puts on weekly basis. Use technical analysis to determine if you'd write a call/put then sell accordingly. The contract would expire sooner, you'd collect your premium quicker, then rinse and repeat? I do the same with my tsla, spce, and pltr shares.... the market is bearish right now, trade the trend, sells covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 20:22:17'] Dont forget that you can also sell puts against those shares at the same time. I would sell monthlys or quarterly, much higher return by end of 2 years
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 20:22:51'] You'll get more premium over time selling shorter dated calls. You can also roll the calls up more aggressively if you decide you want to hold onto your tesla stock in the event it rallies again. Any losses in the calls would be offset by the gains in the shares of you were to use a rolling strategy to retain the shares, but you would pocket premium if the shares sell off and gradually reduce cost basis over time. Probably a good time frame is selling the next month calls.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 20:26:26'] Even if it hits 1K you collect premium and the sale of those shares.  All GRAVY

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 21:57:50'] If you're fine selling TSLA at $1000 and don't mind risking to hold TSLA run to ground, why not? In the worse case, you pocketed $200K - In the best case, you have sold TSLA at $1000 and also bagged an additional 200K Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 22:04:30'] premium for that is tiny relative to what you could get within 6 months. what if it blows past 1k this april? but i’m not an expert, so i have no clue
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 22:20:57'] Can’t you buy the calls without having to sell your shares? Meaning you buy additional calls and sellout...
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 22:21:24'] I would say this is an insanely bad idea, no reason to commit so much capital on a low profit play
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 22:34:07'] I never sell long term calls. Too many extreme things could happen, and the premium doesn't compensate you for the missed opportunity. Much more profitable to sell monthly (or bi-monthly) and roll each month. Do the math on how much you would make in different scenarios for both strategies
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 22:47:23'] By 2023 it could worth alot more so you’d be losing out on that profit.I tried to do covered calls with my Disney stock and it ended up selling @ $115 and now im kicking myself.If I were in your shoes - i would just do shorter time frames and really conservative strike prices if you’re looking for extra money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 22:51:49'] You deserve to donate half of those to me!  I know what to do!  🤓
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 23:01:35'] There is severe risk of tie up of your capital for 2 years.  If TSLA shares go to $2000 the premium on those covered calls would probably spike to $1000++ so you definitely couldn’t buy back the calls to close them out and they most likely won’t be assigned so you’ll be stuck holding the shares for 2 years until they are called away at expiration.  If TSLA moons then you get to look at a huge red number in your account and although you’re still coming out ahead that huge red number will be there for two years to remind your dumb ass to never sell CC LEAPS again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 23:37:00'] Personally I would do something shorter and roll my contract up if needed. Best of luck to you. Either way sounds like you have some great gains in your portfolio.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 06:18:03'] The key point of the whole thing is “I’d also be very happy to sell all my shares at 1k”. That is the most important thing when doing covered calls, specially in a taxed differed account. With that being said, you might wanna rethink your expiration month tho, 2023 is too far out in my opinion.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-11 17:38:24'] I did this but with 1725$ strike price and used the premium to scoop up more shares during this discount period. Only downside is if Tsla spikes to like 2000$ in 2023 but I think that's not likely at least early 2023.Either way selling at 1725$ isn't too bad plus increases my share count.Another option is during this timespan if the price of the option drops I can use margin to buy it back and sell more options at a farther expiry date with a higher strike price and recycle the premium into more shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 14:29:05'] I get the impression this market "crash" won't last forever. You may be poised to sell now at gains and buy back later at a discount. Not telling you what you should do but you could theoretically go either way. If you already own the shares your covered really so if you think it'll hold for a while sell calls if you think it'll tank soon maybe sell shares now and jump back in when market is less foam and get a better price. Or just hold through it all, Tesla is diversified enough they shouldn't go tits up over a market dip. But their competitors might, and if they do Tesla will be worth more in the end. Not advice. Do what you want but you have choices.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 20:32:33'] 11 calls at $200 is $2200...Thought: Sell 11 $1,000 covered calls weekly. Tomorrow that would yield about $300. Let it expire, and do it again, week after week. By April 2023, you would collect $7,200 and you would still have the stock.You would adjust your upper end as the stock price changes.If by chance, your calls get bought out, you can the sell puts weekly to buy it back if/when the stock price drops
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-28 21:57:34'] Your math is wrong you only sell 11 covered calls at 200 that’s only 2200
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 03:09:11'] Tesla is totally overrated. The price / earnings ratio is a disaster. Shareholders will lose a lot of money on the stock.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 13:45:06'] So if tesla crashes to 300 or less, how does that affect your overall account? Think about it as well. You lose more trying to make an additional 200k.

POST_TEXT: b"Came from thetagang, when market was whipsawing I started experimenting with daytrading options. Mostly super short microtrends watching the 1/5 minutes, while keeping an eye on longer trends, but not as closely. Anywho on GME this week I made over 5000 buying ITM or close to the money options playing both sides, cutting losers quick and not pushing my luck on winners. TSLA is the only company I could imagine having violent/wide enough swings in a day to compare. So I'm curious if anyone does this consistently or if this is their goto. Not looking to replicate my gains this week normally, just curious on consensus. I made a quick couple hundred on 1 call and 1 put for TSLA today, but I just wonder if that's mostly due to the recent run-up and its especially volatile right now.\n\nTLDR: anyone do multiple 5-15 minute day trades a day as a main strategy, if so what tickers"

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 16:18:20'] Trading options on Tesla is a rush but a coin flip.  If you are seeking quick 10-20% gains it can be done fairly easily with weeklies… monthlies are obviously safer, and shares even safer.  The stock is volatile as fuck but has a few markers that generally spike it.Next week should dip below 1k to 900-950 (even as low as 850) … quarter delivery numbers report April 3rd and Texas factory grand opening party is the 7th, so first week of April should see another spike.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 22:12:25'] TSLA Calls work but you gotta know the resistance and support lines to play it. Playing it on fridays is a totally lottery ticket. If it’s early in the week and the options are still holding a lot of IV consider using a wide spread like a 1000/1050 call spread so you can stay in long enough for a profit instead of getting whipped around and beat up on a naked call.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-26 08:14:24'] I play (day trade)TSLA, SHOP, AMZN and GOOGL, every day.  90% of my trades are only in these four tickets.  My experience wasn’t different than the other responses here in the beginning but the more you watch it every day you become very comfortable with it and my experience has been it doesn’t behave differently than other tickers. Ppl lose money on it and others bc of what you said, they move $50-$150 a day. So you have to get used to being down a grand or two knowing it can make that up very quickly. But it functions just like other tickers based on its own structure.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-25 13:33:12'] It IS fun. I did well this week except for today I lost 25k, which basically set me back a month.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-26 05:29:02'] TSLA is fun to trade, but it’s one of those that move so fast that it can blow through a stop loss in an instant.   Boner candles and knives are common.   Not for the faint of heart.  Made a grand last week and early this week on it and lost most of it at the end of this week.   The getting into a moving car comment by one of the posters is very true.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-26 07:55:22'] Isnt trading stocks more stable and safe than crypto? Well, thats what i believe since crypto is volatile as hell. The top coins I am talking about. You can make huge gains only if you manage your risk otherwise it fucks you up.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-26 15:12:39'] I have been playing TSLA bull put spreads since November but it’s on hold since early February due to the volatility, downward trend and lack of time. By then I had enough profits to buy 20 commons. So I buy monthly 400 or 500 puts and sell higher puts based on pivots and other lines. I WILL NOT play call spreads. Too risky. It’s doable but recommend strict stop losses as it can blow up in your face if you step away for a bathroom break.

I suppose the question is would you be able to get a better return elsewhere by allowing yourself to get assigned and sell the shares.If TSLA goes on another run it becomes harder to get delta exposure when your short calls are deeper ITM. Maybe you could reinvest in more TSLA shares with the gains from the CCs to negate this.

Had originally sold the Nov 840C at 20 delta over 30 DTE then Tesla went parabolic so I rolled to Dec for a credit. Now I am at 850C for Dec and only down about $28k on it... I'll probably roll to Jan and up to $860 for a credit and use that huge realized loss to reduce this year's taxes.Hard to say if Tesla will stay at this level long term. Another thing to consider is if you have LT tax treatment on your shares and sell a call less than one month CC and get assigned you will make your shares ST.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 10:38:16'] **Intraday: when to switch from 0DTE to 1DTE?**Hi everyone!I have been day trading 0dte options on $SPX and trying to understand when would be the ideal moment of the session to switch from 0dte to 1dte.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that from a certain moment theta starts playing a very significant role in price decay (from my analysis, around 1h30-2h00 before the end of the session). From around that moment, theta becomes a swirl, sucking up essentially all the extrinsic value (assuming IV remains constant).However, before that happens, I have the intuition that there is a moment when theta becomes already "too significant" in relation to gamma (which in theory is increasing, albeit at a different pace from abs(theta)). For my trading style, high gamma is desirable.I tried computing an intraday gamma/theta ratio, giving me a curve which tends to decrease until the end of the session (sometimes with interesting "hiccups") and I was thinking on using a certain level of that curve as a threshold under which I'd switch to 1dte, i.e. to a tenor with less gamma but also (more so) less theta...I imagine that the choice of that threshold also depends on the average duration of my trades, right?Has anyone considered this problem? Reached interesting conclusions?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 16:41:29'] Any advice on trading NVDA going into earnings next month? Still learning about options and have been mainly watching SPY but was thinking about trading NVDA prior to their earnings on May 24.  My thoughts are that the price will at least stay stable or go up over the next several weeks prior to the earnings call. I'm trying to find the best way to profit from this using options. My first thought is just to sell a put. The stock is currently trading at 279. I could sell a way out of the money put at 260 with a May 26 date at 8.35 and buy a put at 240 for 3.85 to limit losses. I would then look to close position a few weeks before expiration. Is there another strategy that would either decrease risk or increase profit? With options, there are so many strategies - strangles, straddles, butterflies, etc -  I'm wondering I may be overlooking one.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 18:01:40'] A question about selling a PUT Apr 21 @ $26 strike for RWM.I was assigned on the 17th of April, but when I looked at the price for RWM, the highest it reached was for $24.86. So I am agreeing to buy 100 shares of RWM for $26 when it is worth only $24.86. Now, if I sell a covered call for May with a $25 strike, I get the premium ($30) but I could still be about $70 in the hole if that one gets assigned. Am I thinking this one right?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 05:23:05'] I have a question about covered calls..I've been selling a covered call on VTI every month and have picked up a few hundred dollars in premium so far. Looking at the options chart, the break-even price for almost all calls is about the same, $206.20. So a $200 call is selling for $5.90, and a $190 call is $15.80.What's the risk for me selling a $190 call vs a $200 one? Let's say the share price rises to $206.21. my shares sell at $200 each, netting me $20,590, including premium. I can then. Buy my shares back for an additional $31 out of pocket.The $190 call would net me $20,580, and I could buy back the shares at $41 additional out of pocket.So the risk to me is almost the same... Why shouldn't I sell deep ITM calls and make more premium? What am I missing here?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 17:42:56'] Hoping to understand how assignment works. Hypothetical situation: I sell an OTM put on XYZ for $10.00 strike for a $0.50 premium. At expiration the ticker shows $9.75 which is technically ITM but for the person who bought the contract they are still above their break even of $9.50. For the buyer it would not make sense to exercise the option because of the remaining $25 to breakeven. I feel pretty confident that I have this part understood.Here is my confusion: many brokers will auto exercise options if they are $0.01 ITM at expiration. Does that account for the premium paid or is it based only on the strike price of the contract and closing price at expiration? Would someone holding this contract at expiration be exercised even though they would be at a $25 loss immediately?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 02:19:48'] Hello everyone, question that I can’t find a clear answer for on google. I’m considering selling put credit spreads on Spy, with the long leg at around a -.18 delta, for roughly 10-15% profit to relatively safely build up my small portfolio. My question is regarding pattern day trading. If I buy say, 5 put credit spreads of the same strikes, and were to sell them the same day, which I’m really planning on doing every other day, but just for reference, would buying and selling 5 put credit spreads in the same day only count as 1 day trade? 5 day trades? Or 10 day trades, 1 each leg? These will be 2 leg strategies, I’m really unsure how day trading, or PDT works regarding options. I even wonder if putting in a sell order on 5 of these, would it trigger a day trade if say, 2 sold right away, and the remaining 3 filled 10 minutes later, would that all count as 1 trade? Sorry to ramble, thanks in advance!

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-21 07:30:47'] I sold a $50 put in MSGE with a 5/19/23 expiry. Today the following spin off occurred:  "Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE: SPHR) (the “Company” or “Sphere Entertainment”) today announced that it has completed the spin-off of its traditional live entertainment businesses and changed its name from Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. to Sphere Entertainment Co. and will begin trading today on the NYSE under the new ticker symbol “SPHR.” The newly-formed live entertainment company, which will take on the name Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. (“MSG Entertainment”), will begin trading today on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “MSGE.”"  My put contract now shows as "SPHR1" but with the same strike price of $50 even though the value of the new SPHR entity is \~$26-$27. The price of the new MSGE entity is around $32 even though yesterday that ticker was trading around $60. I am assuming I have to give E\*Trade a day or two to sort this out in my account?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-22 11:47:45'] I made a silly mistake yesterday and need to figure out if I have to untangle a mess on Monday, or if it's actually not a big deal.What I did:\- Before noon, I sold to open **5 contracts of 24 Apr RUT 1820/1825 CCS @ .40**\- A few hours later, I intended to then sell to open 4 contracts of 24 Apr RUT 1830/1835. Instead, I made a careless mistake and actually set a limit order for **4** **contracts of 24 Apr RUT 1825/1830 CCS @.30**.Order was filled a few minutes later. I didn't even realize it at first until I looked at my position tab and saw this:**-5 1820 C****+1 1825 C****+4 1830 C**So, due to my careless mistake, I effectively BTO and STC the 1825 strike. I'm confused about how this will work out on Monday. Do I still technically have both the 1820/1825 and 1825/1830 spreads? If RUT stays below 1820, does everything just expire worthless and I collect max credit like I normally would? I never hold spreads to expiration, so maybe the more important question is how I would potentially get out of these positions if I'm in profit?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 14:13:52'] Hello everyone. I have tried to look this up but was unable to find a definitive answer. Question being, if I sell calls and outs will I get assigned as soon as the price of the underlying stock reaches the strike?  Will i get assigned at the expiration date if the option is in the money?  Is there a chance that I won’t get assigned?  I am working with naked calls and puts, so would it be better if I just buy the option to close it? When I get assigned will depend on if I close the option or let it get assigned. I know working with naked options is probably not what I should be doing, but high risk high reward. Feel like selling is better long term than buying. Thanks in advance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 21:22:37'] So, I've been searching for some positive or zero EV trades. It's definitely hard to find. Underlyings or options with a lot of volume seem like they do not have those good deals which is understandable since they are so competitive. The question is: Is there a level of volume in an underlying you guys look for which tends to be liquid enough to be safe yet also provide opportunity for some positive EV trades?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 21:39:29'] I'm trying to do some Iron Condors with a small spread.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 18:35:30'] I feel like gme amc and probably others that I'm not paying attention to  on a regular basis are being completely manipulated with phantom shares. They collect the premium on the options and make it appear that the price is going in a certain direction. Once they see where the majority of the itm options are bought they keep the price away from those strikes. They know they dont have to buy any shares because they're controlling where the stock price ends up . Now, they don't have to buy to cover because they're controlling all aspects of the price. They slowly chip away at retailers money and they will end up with everyone's stimulus in part to  the premium they collect. It's a big club and we ain't in it. You can't tell me that gme basically dropping by half all of a sudden after the halt and then amc trading back and forth by pennies ALL damn day ($13.98 - $14.02)isn't suspicious especially with the volume we've been seeing 🤔  There's a lot of backroom, dark pool trading stuff going on and unless Cohen can get the board to recall the shares for votes it will continue as they chip away at our portfolios a dollar at a time. They have the capital and the time to do it and they've been sticking in our asses for decades and no one is stopping them. The media, the dtcc, congress,  etc., are all in the same damn bed giving eachother handies and wiping their noses and asses with our money and futures.Edit: we may as well just drive out to wall street and throw our wallets out the window. Im holding off buying any options until after the gme conference call to see where that goes.Edit 2: the only reason anything was done in 2008 was because everyone lost everything and main street forced Congress's hand. Then they overturned all the regulations a few years ago when it was no longer fresh in our minds.  We need to make more noise and force their hands again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-10 14:26:52'] I really like Etrade in general.  I've had good experiences with customer service, I'm used to the app and how Power Etrade works, and my company stocks vest there, so I have a view of all of my stocks at once.  My only issue is that they do not seem to offer any money market type interest for cash sitting in the account.  I opened up a fidelity account to take advantage of that, but I just didn't like the UI and app as much.  I hate to just give up on earning 3-4% on my cash throughout the year by leaving my money in Etrade, but is there any other site with a modern UI like that that does offer a decent money market fund?

Im in Canada (using Wealthsimple) so this is what the full buy worked out to be:* Limit Price - 0.46USD / Cost - $46.00USD / Exchange Rate (plus 1.5% fee) - 1.3730 / Fee - $2.02USD / Total Cost - **$65.93CDN**so the stock was around 10.38/share when i bought. my breakeven price when purchasing was 10.95/share, but now when i look on the app it shows 10.82. SNAP currently trading at 10.68 (as of 1:35pm EST). and on my app, the option is 0.32USD. so was wonder what the "odds" are of this being a successful trade or let is expire?anything else you all can provide for some guidance is welcome.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 11:12:08'] Don't just use dividends to buy VTI. When the shares have an acceptable gain, or are at risk of falling, just sell shares and diversify directly by reducing the weighting in your overall portfolio.You have two problems, or really two sides of the same problem coin: poor diversification leads to concentration risk should the stock tank. If you fix the diversification problem, you don't have to worry about your concentration risk and can save the money you've been spending on loss insurance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 11:48:42'] For years, I just let it keep growing as I had maxed out my ESPP, and also kept getting annual stock awards and special stock awards vesting throughout the year. In late 2021, I started selling covered calls on my company shares. Last year (2022), I started increasing the covered calls at various OTM strikes until I was able to sell calls on all my shares at various expiration dates. I only got assigned 1 call in 2021 when  I first started, and later got assigned 1 put in 2022, so I was back to selling the max possible number of calls all of 2022. Now in 2023, I recently quit my job, and incidentally just got assigned on a pair of calls. I don’t plan to grow the number of shares in the company stock again, as I’ll either reinvest it elsewhere or sell more puts for a different stock.I used to DRIP the dividends while I was working, but I’ve now stopped the DRIP to take the cash elsewhere.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-04 05:31:35'] an equity collar might be what you are looking for. It's essentially both selling a call against your position, then using that premium to fund a long put. It does cap your upside some, but brings down the cost of the insurance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 20:19:55'] You can sell long duration ITM calls if you want to be neutral for a few quarters. If you are worried about a market collapse(not your company operations) you can look at broad market puts. I’d look at 9-12 months out, and at least 10% otm. If you buy 2x the contracts you would be close to market neutral at a 10% drop. If your company has a lot of debt, you can buy 4x contracts 20% otm and you’ll have a lot more gamma on a down move and a big volatility expanse would let you sell some of the contracts to reduce total cost in the trade. You could also consider spreading the trade off if you get a big down move. You would look to sell a put underneath the one you bought to reduce the risk of the option leg.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 20:38:49'] Lets say you have $1,000,000 in stock with a cost basis of $0.Sell $100,000 of your stock for cash. The clock starts ticking (has to happen before end of year!)Buy $1000 far OTM options (say delta 10 or less) in 100 different stocks.From chance, you'll get wiped out on \~90 of them ($90,000 loss), but the other 10 should be worth about $10k each, which you can buy for $1k each. Sell $10k for $100k in stock when you exercise. You still have $1,000,000 but have a diversified portfolio and only owe taxes on $10k in profit.An example without stocks:I have 100 cups. One of them has $100,000 worth of gold in it, The others have a paperclip. I offer any cup for $1,000. You buy them all. You keep the one with gold in it, and sell the paperclips for $0.01.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-08 10:00:27'] Without knowing how much of your PF is in these shares, or what  the rest of your PF is consisting of all I can do is give some suggestions. The tricky part with all of this is sizing.1.) Look at the stock's beta to a sector etf or competitor. If you want  to hedge the sector, you can take a small short position in this, using your long shares as collateral. I wouldnt do this in serious size, maybe 10% at most. Eg.long 100k in AAPL, short 10k QQQ2.) You can put on "costless" collars, sell a call and use it to finance a put. Take a look at the options chain to see if it's  agreeable  to this. 3.) A ratio spread is a good way to get almost free (not riskless) hedges. Sell the 30 delta put, and use that premium to buy 3x 10 delta puts. This is a hedge against extreme moves to the downside. The risk is that the underlying breaches your short put and doesnt reach your long puts upon expiry. The "cost" is margin space between the two strikes.(With hedges like these collars and ratios, I typically buy them 3 months out and roll/manage them monthly. Sometimes I'll leave the existing one on at the end of the month and just put another one on as well. Situuation dictates)4.)Synthetic Short-  Sell an ATM call, buy an ATM put. Those are both short 50 deltas so you just sold 100 shares essentially.  Size according to taste.5.) If youre straight up buying long dated OTM puts, the trick with that is noticing a time when the IV is abnormally low so you can buy them at a discount. Use IV *Rank* to tell you this. Im not sure how tax loss harvesting works in your jurisdiction so take this with a grain of salt; any losses you incur on these hedges (or elsewhere on your PF) can offset your cap gains. So if youre down 5k, you can sell for 5k profit and net it all out.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-03 13:53:42'] Put hedging is insurance. The better the protection, the more the costs and the lower the deductible (loss down to the strike price). If you want lower cost insurance, buy further OTM,  accepting a larger  deductible..At times, I've used 10% wide vertical spreads (10% OTM) IWM or SPY. They're relatively low cost with a modest amount of protection and will not hedge a tail risk crash.  If they come into play, the long leg can be pyramided with rolling down.

POST_TEXT: b"I've lost on a few TSLA spreads and told myself I would steer clear until after Powell speaks tomorrow to do another. \n\nWelllllll I didn't listen to myself, got fomo, and opened a 3/19 call credit 740/750 yesterday. Woke up this morning and thought to myself that I should of followed the rule I set for myself. So sold early AM for a small loss. \n\nNeedless to say, its down 5% today and I'm assuming tomorrow won't be a good day with the feds talking about their March meeting. \n\nHindsight tells me I should of held on to it and made a profit this afternoon but I'm a pretty new trader so it's a learning experience. Went against my rule, didn't stick to my gut when it comes to tomorrow's announcements after breaking my rule, and am now wondering why I didn't stick to my plan. \n\nLong story short (learning lesson from one new options trader to other new options traders) - figure out your enter AND exit strategies before anything else and stick to it! Had I stuck to my predetermined stop loss "
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 19:38:41'] Good lesson, but I would also evaluate your risk appetite and target more predictable and consistent trades. When I first started options trading a friend recommended the Options Advisor, by Schaefer. I re-read the section on conservative options strategies, and he goes over his approach to selling options. He favors high quality slow movers with decent volatility, and even sticking to index etfs to minimize exposure to stock events. Basically a strategy of hitting a lot of singles consistently, with tight risk control. He has a nice section on selling credit spreads, as well as selling naked options.I consider TSLA extremely volatile, momentum driven, sentiment driven, and generally unpredictable. Feels a little bit like rolling the dice to me.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 18:52:50'] A great pro tip on credit spreads is to target like 30-45 days out. It's the tasty trade "rules" but gives you so much breathing room. You get a couple weeks to let it go your direction, and then manage it around 21 DTE to either roll for credit or close for profitWeekly spreads are brutal for two reasons, your strikes are closer to the current price for the same credit, and changes in prices can wildly change your spread value in each direction
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 19:46:45'] Never regret following your rules - learn and fine tune the rules over time. Discipline is extremely key for a long profitable stint in the market.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 21:33:48'] Why you open a spread with only 2 DTE (Days Till Expiration) ?The chance of your spread winning you money which such low time is almost zero. You should have opened the spread at least 2 months out and let time play in your favor. Stonks go up over time, but the road to heaven is full of stones, so just give your trade enough time for things to slowly go up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-16 19:39:13'] This is probably a completely ignorant newbie question, but if you did your call credit spread way out of the money and instead of the spread giving you say a $3 credit, it gave you a $0.30 credit, couldn’t you just buy 10 of the further out of the money spread to “almost” guarantee a win?  Say in this example it was a 900/910 spread, the credit would be much less, but risk would be much less with an almost certain return because the 900 option would be almost impossible to reach. Is it a matter of available margin?  Sorry for the long-winded question.  Just trying to understand the downsides!

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-17 13:21:37'] Just like you, most of us learn this lesson the hard way. My advice for you would be to identify a strategy that can perform well over the long term and start trading it consistently. If your strategy had an edge and if you followed it religiously, you would have made a good amount of money at the end of 25 trades.All the best.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-17 16:54:55'] I'm always on the fence of selling/closing my position and I keep reading that if its good enough to screenshot then its good enough to sell.

I though it was good enough to screenshot so I got out.  Its nothing crazy like others posting thousands of profit but I felt "good" about it.Now to learn more and keep educating myself to pick more winners and learn more strategies.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 11:32:29'] Yes. It is possible. Calls don't have to go in the money to increase in value. They just need to move towards the target
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 11:39:42'] It doesn’t matter where the current stock price is. If the price of the stock goes up from where it was when you bought the call, AND if it goes up enough to counteract theta decay and IV effects, your call will gain value
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 16:55:19'] If you're not too familiar with how delta, theta, and gamma affect options search for optionprofitcalculator on google and click the fist link. Very helpful for beginners
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-03 12:30:43'] To answer your question, you must understand why options even have a value ($). An option can be used to buy 100 shares of said stock. That’s what you call “exercising” a contract. A contract can be exercised whether it’s ITM, ATM, or OTM.Now, if SPY is trading at 435, and I buy a 440 call, why would I want to exercise (buy 100 shares) of SPY when I could get them 5 dollars cheaper? What if I bought a 430 call, that’s great! I can buy 100 shares of SPY for 5 dollars less the actual value. Here’s where value ($) of an option gets either cheaper or more expensive. Option contracts that are in ITM have the highest value because you can buy a stock below it’s actually price. OTM contracts are cheaper because by the time expiration comes, nobody will want to buy said stock for more than it’s actually worth.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 11:41:32'] Yes. I bought intc calls with 70 strike.Paid 6 bucks each when intc was around 43ish.Sold a bunch now for 12 bucks. Will sell more at 20 if the market keeps rallying
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-02 16:30:54'] it depends alot on the DTE and strike, if the DTE is close to 0 and the strikes are far OTM, you need a bigger move, you’re betting on gamma As DTE approaches 0, theta increases. that call looks like -3.97 right now. Delta also decreases, sitting around 0.32. im too lazy to do the math, but if you do it and plug your option into option profit calculator, you can see how much TSLA needs to be at, and when, to be profitableedit: you need a $12.4 dollar move to not incur a loss from theta LOLalso RH says your breakeven is $908.43 or a 4.29% move

POST_TEXT: b'What are your opinions on TSLA credit spreads? Seems like we can make a lot of money, no?'
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 16:08:23'] Sure but tsla can go up or down 10% at any time lol. There’s a reason why iv and premiums are so high.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 17:23:58'] You can also lose a lot of money, yes!
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 18:11:16'] Yes, but as mentioned, the IV is high so it sure can blow past your strike prices in either direction. So have a plan for when that eventually happens. I think the upside is more likely than downside in the short to medium term, it could easily get near $1000 within a couple of weeks (or days) with a decent catalyst.I'm doing covered calls with weeklies personally, $45k capital with margin to get ~$1500 per week with a strike price $50 OTM is pretty juicy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 19:38:22'] I’ve lost quite a few hundred dollars on Tesla spreads, the problem is it’s so erratic because it’s way overvalued but also a meme stock so it’s almost impossible to predict

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-08 20:45:53'] The downside of the covered call is giving up your upside.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 19:21:09'] It risky but worth it if you use proper risk management and have a target and exit plan. The thing with spreads not much you can do to defend it , so accept a full loss,  as long as you ok with that
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-07 20:17:31'] You should do it if you have a plan/opinion on where price might go in the time frame you're looking to sell the spread in. I think mechanically selling a put credit spread without regard for the bigger picture is asking to be blown up.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 13:23:25'] You waited too long - when the stock started to approach 970 you should have bought the option out .

Now I am surprised you haven’t been assigned- why the owner of the long call option you sold hasn’t exercised his option to call away the shares at 970 is beyond me. Either they figure they made 17000 already in the long call and want to see how much more they can squeeze before assignment or - they don t Have the 97k to call the stock away . You can buy out the call option you sold now  for 17k and own the stock at a higher price of 1140. You also have  your premium so you are ahead  of the game - unless you don’t have 17k to buy the option out .

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:23:20'] In addition to the risk where the stock may unexpectedly breach your strike price, there is also a risk where your broker may force close your OTM positions even before they become ITM. They may do it as long as they think they are near being breached!I got burned by this today. I had a few put spreads with short strikes at 600, 575, 560, and 530. Near the market closed, there was a sudden dip. While I was trying to add more put for next week, I suddenly received notifications that my OTM positions were closed. While I was still scratching my head about what just happened, I saw the stock made a U turn and then my 780/830 call got closed too! All of these cost me over $2000!Later I contacted my broker (Tastyworks), they said there was no margin call on my account. It is just some expiration risk management they did. He said if the trend continued and the short leg went into money and the stock dropped on Monday, then my account would suffer a huge loss. That's why they force closed them for me.I can see where they're coming from and it's my fault not to realize this risk before. But the 530 put and 780 call were so far away from the money. I think they're a bit too aggressive on this. As a comparison, I had a 575 put at TDA and they didn't touch it.Going forward, I'll try to close the positions out early even though it cost some money to do so. I hope my story is helpful for people who are not aware of this.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 14:01:29'] Even if the final print is crazy, you can choose not to exercise your options. Most likely the owner of a 670 call wouldnt exercise it.Its a different story if you/the other party traded in the auction to hedge it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 15:42:04'] So if I sold $690 covered calls that expired today, will my shares be called away? I see the share price has dropped below $680 shortly after 4:00 PM. Assuming the share price remains at $680 or even drops a bit on Monday, wouldn't whoever chooses to exercise the calls I sold them end up taking a loss?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 16:44:02'] So I had a cash secured put at 640 that I sold at 5.36, expired today. I feel like since it expired above my strike price it should expire worthless and I keep the premium, right?  My Merrill acct is showing that it’s now worth 7.10 a share and bc it’s worth more than I sold it for I netted a loss on the transaction, what gives?  When you sell a put do you have to beat the strike price AND the option value?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:09:50'] I have the same experience. I sold 26 690/700 call credit spreads. As you guys know, tesla exploded in the final seconds and closed at 695. It says I’m short 2600 shares, but the transaction is pending.Really my question is, if I’m assigned those shares, when will RH close my short position Monday morning (9:30, 10am, etc.)? Should I contact them in advance?Will it be a problem considering my account doesn’t have anywhere near enough to buy 2600 shares?It sounds like I could stand to lose a lot if tesla goes above 700+, but the opposite is true is tesla opens significantly below 690. Am I understanding my situation correctly? Thanks for reading!

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 01:07:26'] Question for all you options enthusiasts that are too intelligent to use WSB as your main forum of discussion (unlike myself who is clearly the type of moron that belongs on there...)So, as the dumb speculator and gambler that I am,  I put half of my savings (80k) in Tesla leaps (puts) at a strike of $660 and expiration of 1/2022 about 30 minutes before close. I was planning on holding this for many months but I admit I was hoping I had caught the something close to the top. That last minute spike literally threw my leap underwater by over 10%, which being the novice stock market gambler that I am, I have no precedent to understand whether it was likely a true gap up or more likely to get sold and be volatile next week? Did IV crush or that last minute price movement really decrease the “intrinsic value” of my leaps that quickly? I saw the asks closed at 5 for $195 and bids of 5 for $125 My main questions are:a. Are options as “rationally priced” during a close for Tesla options as happened at market close today as you would expect on any other day?  b. Is that immediate selloff in after hours from 695 to 680 as “significant of an indicator of demand” as the original buying up from 636 to 695 was an indicator? For Monday to be bearish, who would be the supposed sellers on Monday that didnt try to sell at close today to the impending wave of institutional buyers?  Or as a bearish option holder should i see this crazy gap up at market close as scary and a likely indicator of few sellers come Monday?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 17:28:14'] This may a case of market manipulation (legal or not).  I had money riding on the 660C, sold short, expiring at 4 pm.  I had my buy-to-close market order set up and had my finger on the mouse to pull the trigger.  TSLA was hovering around 660 right before closing, and it showed 658.34 as you said.  The going Call option premium dropped down to 1.00/1.50 from 10 a couple of minutes prior.  So it looked it was going down to 0, expiring worthless, jiving with the wildly fluctuating stock price.  The market closed and 658.34 stuck on the screen for some time.  I went back to the computer 30 mins later and TSLA changed to $695. I called Fidelity and the stock rep pointed out on their Active Trader Pro platform in the “Time and Sale” menu to show the TSLA buy/sale history.  At 16:00:00, the buy/sale history showed the last ones at last price:  Sale 695, Bid 665.15, and Ask 665.96.  How could the stock be sold at 695 while the Bid/Ask were 34 lower?  The Fidelity rep then found a super large size transaction with 69,323,258 shares down the list sold at $695, with Bid/Ask again at $664.99/$665.00.  Who would want to pay $695 when the going price was $34 lower?  Is this market manipulation or what?  Where is the SEC here?

TSLA has been a good one to write options (weeklies).  I usually open a credit spread (call) on Friday or Monday and add to it on Wed or Thursday, taking advantage of the declining time value.  It has been a good two month winning streak.  Thanks for sharing!

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-23 18:31:22'] Without any judgments I’m assuming you bought these 12/22 several moments before close. Problem with this strangle is that traditionally Tesla is not an up and down stock during the intraday . It generally comes out of the box either up or down , and stays that way for the day . Your trade leaves you with rapid tim decay and not much room to move . You have 40 dollars on the wingspan, that is actually not a bad spread for Tesla if you had more time . Look at the charts , starting with 11/30 when it was 1131 through Dec 6th at 971 down to 897 on Dec 20 th . You have a downward head with shoulders , into a consolidation at 894 on Dec20 th where it forms a cup with a handle a classic entrance point for a steep increase - in that scenario you put was dooms to fail as the price continued upward . Your move was to recognize that and immediately sell the 990 put for small  loss maybe a small gain .

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-03 20:52:10'] Risk management happens on order entry. You should figure out how to reduce your delta in the position by either selling calls against your position or exiting some of it. Theta is working against you, and you'll see faster decay as the expiration month gets closer. You might get lucky on Monday and the iv expands with the new order numbers. Get up with the opening bell and watch the value. You might be able to get out with a minimal loss.Personally, I would be selling the May 1200 calls 1:1 with the calls you already have.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-03 20:44:03'] My assumption is that it will drop like a rock within the next couple weeks followed by a huge bullish jump..hedge. Sell the hedge puts then allow yourself to profit off the jump when your IV increases on those calls.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-04 07:45:36'] As others said you can sell calls and turn it into a PMCC ( long call diagonal debt spread). If you sure the short you are selling it at a price you are willing to sell your long at. Options are a leveraged and time sensitive instrument. The amount of capital at risk should be adjusted accordingly. Buying an ITM is the proper way to play it long. Typically it’s better to buy closer to a .90 delta because there is less extrinsic and it will track the stock much closer.

If I only have $100k to invest, what is the best financial instrument to make use of this knowledge?For example, I could try to buy SPY call options expiring today with a strike price 4% higher than the current strike price. This should give me about a 50x multiplier on the money invested, so $100k --> $5M.Is there anything better than this (like futures, etc.)? Even at the cost of taking a massive risk with the $100k (but no extra leverage beyond the $100k), what financial instrument gives the largest possible multiplier?

I was studying some past record and found:Stock Example A, back in Nov 2022 stock price was around $60, back then if I pick the Long Call March 30 2023 strike @ $85, it was selling for $3; today the stock is trading @ $87.25 and the Long Call is $5.42 - it doesn't look much profit, but this stock sky rocket to $115 back in mid Jan, and back then the Long Call was pricing @ $30, I think the idea is when your option is deep ITM thats where the big profit comes in?If that's the idea, let's say I am hoping a stock will rise 50% by next year, and I should do the LEAPS at around 25%, so if the stock does hit my target and rise 50%, the option is 25% deep ITM, and best to happen couple months before the option expires to have more time value in it?Thanks

So, I just took this trade:Bought 500 shares of BBBY for 1.15 for a total of $575Sold covered calls, 5 contracts 1/19/2024 C @ 2.00 for 0.57 per share, netting me $285. My total invested so far is $290Bought puts, 5 contracts 1/19/2024 @ 1.00 for 0.59 a share, costing me $ 295. My total invested is $585.First of all, the reason I do this is mostly to learn, and $585 down the drain won't make me richer or poorer.I believe this is a collar strategy right? My first. I also believe, what makes it a good collar is the assymetry, I have a lot of upside (from 1.15 to 2.00) and exposed to small downside (from 1.15 to 1.00). Is this correct?These are the scenarios I see come 1/19/2024:BBBY ends over $2.00: my put is worthless, my underlying is gone, my call is exercised. I've still made $1000 though, almost double my investment.BBBY ends between $1.15 and $2.00: my put is worthless, my call is too. I keep my underlying and have made some kind of return, between $0 and $0.85 per share.BBBY ends between $1.15 and $1.00: my put is worthless, my call is too. I keep my underlying and have lost some money, between $0 and $0.15 per share.BBBY ends below $1.00: my call is worthless, I keep my underlying, my put appreciated and offset the losses on my underlying, so my loss is capped at $0.15 per share.Are these scenarios all correct? Do I have something wrong?Last scenario: BBBY goes bankrupt, or gets delisted, are my options gone? Is my underlying worthless? What about if it gets bought out or taken over? All help is appreciated!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 12:27:08'] Hello, noob question here.  Suppose I want to buy a Call option, but the market is quickly going up. If I put the Ask Price as my Limit Price, by the time I click on "submit", the cost of the option has already risen above the Ask Price.  Ideally I would put a limit price that is 2x or 3x the current ask price, but my broker (IBKR) limits how much higher than the Ask Price I can go by 20% max. If I put a limit price above 20% of the ask price, it will automatically reject my order (mentioning a price cap for legal reasons).  That said, I noticed that a limit price 20% higher than the ask price is not enough to get a fill when the market is shooting up very fast.  So what is the best way to ensure the fill of a call while the market is shooting up?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 18:46:28'] Guys, I am very new to options trading and still learning the basics. I recently discovered the iron butterfly/ Christmas tree strategy but it seems to good to be true. I tried a couple of price points on options profit calculator.    http://opcalc.com/QVh    It basically says that on March 13th, even if SPY moves around 2% in either direction, you'll make a 50-150% profit!! There must be a catch as it seems to good to be true! Is it the fills on such orders, is it the brokerage fees that opcal is not taking into account? What is it?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 03:54:41'] I have read through Michael Sinceres Understanding Options and feel I understand the basics just about enough to start writing covered calls for paper trading.I'm using tastyworks and am a little confused about how to pick an expiration date.From the book I thought there would be some weekly options but that options expired on the 3rd Friday of every month.Given the amount of options available I find it difficult to choose an expiration date? Knowing that the 3rd Friday of every month would be when most expire helped frame how and when I might trade but now I'm not sure when I want to trade if I want to do monthly options. Wild or be fair to say that If I want to trade monthly then I can start today and just look at options that expire in a month from now?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-11 10:02:56'] My option strategyMy strategy for optionsI need your advice!My english is not good but I try to explain  what I will do.Maybe is it not so wise.Example:SPX aktuell Price is 4000,00Above the Price 1. Credit spread deep ITM for    450 USD: buy Put 4155/sell Put 41502. Debit spread deep OTM for ca. 20 USD : buy Call 4180/sell call 4175 Below the Price3. Credit spread deep ITM for 450 USD : buy Call 3860/ sell call 38654. Debit spread deep OTM for ca. 20 USD : buy Put  3590/ sell Put 3585The total risk is 140 USD.All option expires in 5 days.If the price moves down or up by 70 USD then the risk is gone and if is more then it is a profit. The idea is that on one side the loss is limited to 70 USD but on the other side it can theoretically go up to 405+480= 885 USD. Of course, to be on the safe side, it will be closed early if it stands at e.g. 100 USD profit. It must be SPX because it is a European option that cannot be preassigned. The 5 days are necessary to give time for the price movement.Greetings

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 11:14:08'] Hi everyone - can someone explain to me like I was five years old, what does lowering your cost basis mean? If I add up all the premiums I collect from writing CC-s on a stock that was assigned to me through a CSP, I am only going to make a profit if it gets called away at or close to the price I bought it for right? If I keep reducing my cost basis by the amount of premiums I receive, I am only going to maybe break even if the stock gets called away at a lower price than the initial purchase, no? Can someone demonstrate this with some numbers? Apologies for the dumb question.

I could buy about 12000 shares of this stock for about 100$ but my broker, Fidelity, won't let me.  (unless I call a rep about it and I dont want to go through that whole rigmarole). What possible risk could I be taking apart from losing all of the 100$ that I put into it ? Why is this trading check put into place ?

The price is at 84.55 and the nearly ATM 3/17 $85 contract is only 0.08 with only 4% IV. 1 month ago the stock had normal volatility and then it almost doubled a few weeks ago and since then it’s had stable price-action. I bought some of those 85c contracts, so we’ll see what happens, but the risk is so low for the high reward.

I'm going to now trade overhead bearish option spreads instead of shorting the stock. $420 is my target.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-20 13:52:49'] If you are going long and then use the STRADDLE or STRANGLE OPTIONS. Both STRADDLE and STRANGLE Option are Bidirectional Strategies that allows one to benefit no matter the direction of the of the stock. Only difference is a STRADDLE OPTIONS is done ATM while the STRANGLE OPTION is OTM. You just need to make sure that the probability is up, meaning the chance of profit is high and above 70%, and make sure that both Deltas are at .50 (CALLS) & -.50 (PUTS), make sure GAMMA has enough speed to outpace "THETA" (TIME DECAY). You also want to look at VEGA which is VOLATILITY, this the most important factor of them all because this is the only way any Option can make money. Without Volatility your options will go down in value because of an "INCREASING THETA" which THETA is always a negative number. In fact in the case of THETA you want to find one that is low so you loose less money by the day for every day the strategy is open.The other reason to go with a STRADDLE or STRANGLE OPTION is because it will help you deal with sudden drops in value in cases like increasing interest rates like the 10 Year Bond Yield or increasing interest rates which have a devastating effect on Tech Stocks. In the case of Tesla, which has a swing between 50 or 60 points and some times more, you can make a ton of money off a strategy like this.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 10:05:02'] LEAPs are one strategy, but you should also consider using calendar LEAPs.For example, your analysis shows stock price of $1000 by 2022. You buy the jan 2022 or 2023 $1000 call, sell the $1000 june 2022 call. If The june call expires worthless, you keep the credit, effectively giving u a lower entry price on your long calls.The nice thing about this setup is if price goes down a little in the short term, you can make money on the decline rather than lose. I recommend using options calculator and playing around with different strikes and expiry.You can sell the monthly contract vs your LEAP, and just roll the monthly forward for additional credits to lower your cost basis.Advanced tip: sell your call at $1200 instead of $1000, which builds in a vertical spread to the calendar. This way if price rises too quickly in the short term, you still make money. You can also use a back ratio to get the same effect. For example, buy 5 $1000 LEAPs and sell 4 $1000 monthlies. Final advanced tip, buy a butterfly to neutralize vega.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 10:25:47'] READ this whole thread. Kind of comical. This is r/options right? This about making profitable option plays.  Somehow it has become the historical performance of TSLA. Last I checked we don't make money in options based on historical performance. Stay focused people. IMO, The stock is in a downtrend so set a target and then make an options play that benefits. I'm making a bearish call spread. This after I covered my short for a profit.  If you think the stock can bounce from here, determine how far and how long it can bounce and make a play at it. If you think it goes sideways here.. Straddle this manipulated stock.  Best of luck all!
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-21 16:57:44'] The thing with TSLA is that options, whether short term or longer term, are so expensive that it’s often just better in many cases to buy shares and sit on them. One may pay the price of 50 shares for at the money LEAPS on it which expire in two years, so imo in that case I would rather just buy 50 shares for the same price instead of paying that options price to potentially get profits equivalent to 100 shares (if all goes well in those two years without any major hiccups). And shares don’t expire.But if you were very bullish on TSLA over the next year or two where you felt it will be at least at and ideally well above your breakeven price for any given LEAPS, then of course you could consider them regardless (keeping in mind all the risks associated with options obviously, with worst case scenario being all of that money disappearing).There is of course money to be made with TSLA options, there’s a reason there’s so much craze over them all the time, but one has to have a good amount of funds to risk for a potential 100% loss, and also be right on a lot of things such as how much the stock moves and if that move happens within ones speculated time-frame, etc.

Personally I would write covered calls with the expectations that he is doing the deal,  the 52.50's 3 months out, and own 45's puts 3 month out. net debit is about 1.60 ( 160 cost for the option side ) if he closes the deal that's a small upside loss of $160 of the cost to put it on and no extra gain from 52.50 onwards it it fails the max loss is about $360.00 due to the put protection.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 15:03:11'] The downfall to doing a covered call that long is what are you going to do if it goes ITM by Jan 2022. They won’t exercise it early most likely so you have that 70k in initial capital tied up for another year not making you any more.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 15:35:18'] I feel long covered calls might hurt you in future if TSLA goes beyond 1000 within 2 years. I'm sure it will go. Instead, go for weakly coverd calls.Weekly coverd calls for 2 years will earn you approximately $19200. 200x4x24=19200. $200 per covered call per week
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 15:31:17'] > I haven't found any other stock with the call option two years out that is that high to reduce the initial investment. IE AAPL is at 133...would put strike price at 190 relatively, further relatively price should be 38....but its 9.40. It's a silly comparison.   The average implied volatility of TSLA is about double that of AAPL so it's expected that TSLA premiums would be much higher on a relative basis.As for not finding any other such stocks, you didn't look very far.  Check out the meme stocks with sky high IV.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 18:25:06'] It’s not that there isn’t anything “wrong” with this...your max profit is 100% in 2 years.  That beats just about anything out there.The problem with this is the bulls think so highly of this company that they are believing it will be at 2000 or 2500 over the next several years.  Seems kind of ridiculous but many people are positing that.  So you potentially are missing out on tremendous upside.I think the better thing to do is write quarterly call options and you can make adjustments every quarter with your strikes.  Remember you only brought in 20K in premium.  I would think you can easily bring in 3-4K/ each quarter with little risk (e.g. delta) and give yourself more wiggle room to increase your strikes over time....so in the event TSLA did moon you can take advantage of that.  2 years is a very long time to wait for a call option to expire. Again...there is nothing wrong with this strategy.  Options are wonderful there are so many things you can do with them
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 16:17:44'] If you have no real intent of keeping the shares ($1k for TSLA in 2 years is not unreasonable based on how the market has behaved), then why not reduce locked up capital by running a pmcc instead of a traditional cc? You do have more downside risk with pmcc since your long could end up worthless (I buy the LEAP at .8 delta for some safety), but your RoC is much higher dollar for dollar.Genuinely curious.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 21:14:04'] >If TSLA is under 500....well I just long held TSLA and have the 100 shares.Why not take some risk off so you don't have to deal with this? Especially if your goal is to reduce risk in this trade.You could turn this into a collar as well if you want to cap the downside.If you moved it to the Jan '22 date, moved to the 900c, and bought a 600p, your max upside is 22.7k and your downside is now 7.2k instead of 50k.  This is significantly less risk for marginally less upside and a shorter duration for this trade. If the trade goes to plan and by EOY, Tesla is at or over $900/share, your net gain is 32.5% on your original 70k. If you had just held shares, your risk would be much more significant and at a $900 price tag, you'd be at a 28.5% gain. This puts you ahead AND caps your downside. A better winner by your risk-off metric, I think.Here you go for the visual people (make it dark mode, I promise it's worth it):   [https://optionstrat.com/a2EKwjgPAc](https://optionstrat.com/a2EKwjgPAc)If you're wrong and by EOY, Tesla is below $600, you can still cash out at a higher market price.If Tesla is flat and we see it's still $700 by EOY, then you still took in $2k from the premium on the CC less the premium on the put and your downside was hedged.Just a thought.EDIT: Fixed the link

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 21:48:23'] I think it's a good trade. People will suggest other things that could make more money which is totally valid, but I've been in finance long enough to know that nobody knows what can happen; we only know what has happened. IV could drop off in nine months. The stock could correct and your covered call premiums could be reduced yielding less than $20,000 over the same period. If you're happy with the potential to take a double in two years, which by the way exceeds the index 5x, that's huge! You're more in control of your returns. There are people that will criticize the investment but they might not even make $20,000 in two years on $50,000. At the end of the day, you need to be happy and content with your trade/investment. And if you are, don't let anyone change it. The only time you should consider a second opinion is if you can recreate the trade with less risk or a more efficient method that guarantees a return in excess of your 40%.Edit: Had to correct the return and changed wording.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 16:50:32'] Not ‘this’ long.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 21:03:39'] Have you considered selling call spreads instead of a CC? Example, sell the spread from 800-820, if TSLA goes above 820 then you will still participate in those profits. The rule to this is you have to pretend it is a covered call and sell your shares if the short strike is breached and you close the spread.I'd agree with the other comments, one downside of a CC is you get locked in if it goes ITM, having that much capitol tied up for that long seems unfortunate.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-21 22:51:03'] You went too far out. Tied up 50k trying to be too safe.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 00:28:27'] One of the *soundest strategies* I've read on this forum so far which makes sense on a stock you want to hold, capping your upside but also lowering your risk to 500. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-22 02:11:02'] The cool thing I take away from this 20k covered call is that now you have 20k freed up to buy or do the wheel on other stocks making your money that you mad work for you.You’ll earn more than 50k capital in the 2 years on this play.

POST_TEXT: b'Ive been wheeling and selling CSPs the last couple months. Opened some CSP on TSLA, NVDA, and MSFT yesterday, and they all have a nice 25-35% gain after 1 day. Do most close out quickly to lock in the gains or roll them to a lower strike?\n\nI like looking at contracts from a $/day perspective. I usually get around $10-20/day wheeling at .3 Delta, so a quick $200/day is always nice to lock in.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 07:58:29'] Another way to look at it is from a new risk/reward perspective. What you stand to lose has gone up by 35% and what you stand to make has been reduced by the same amount. Is that new risk/reward worth it to hold for the remaining 29 days? That’s a call you have to make. Personally if I could make 35% of the max gain in one day, I’d call it a day and look for other opportunities.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:54:39'] I haven’t been doing this too long so take that for what you will, but I usually roll up and out at 50%. However if it’s around 2 weeks before expiring I’ll close it out if it’s in a profit. If it’s negative it’s a case by case basis to see if I can roll up and out within a reasonable time frame and get a net credit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-26 09:53:30'] It's interesting as i just started selling CSP's, different stock, but same question.  I mean I would take the money and run, start over on a later expiry.  I'll probably get killed for some reason for that answer, but in my brief time, and i mean brief, i've been up 50% in a few days which was great, but see it all go away, or negative after i convinced myself that 50% is good, but wanted more.

That's a 33% ROI from a 1 cent move, which could be obtained from volatility and increased interest alone. But the other thing that I think about would be.. how would you exit on 40,000 contracts. Surely there's not THAT many people just "following along".I get that whoever made that writeup is certainly smarter than I am. But I also have a hard time wrapping my head around why you ever throw away $120,000 as a hedge clear down at the $40 put. Have we ever seen any company tank 90% in 9 days that actually produces a tangible product? I'm not so sure, but if you still think about what would happen to those contracts if it tanked even 15-20% in those 9 days, you would have huge returns on your investment (provided you could actually find another bag holder).

By Buying these 3 cent puts their buying power just doubled mostly, margin has been freed up for other trades.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-24 16:59:36'] >Recall from our previous commentary that a dealer is short massive call spreads in TSLA OTC to a major Japanese tech fund. The dealer is most definitely long stock on a delta neutral basis to hedge their short call spread. This much long stock will probably cause the dealer to blow through the firm's risk limits in the event the stock goes to zero. The dealer's risk management department probably forced them to buy these puts as a hedge.>If the above premise is true, one can back out the notional of the OTC call spreads that the dealer is short. These call spreads are probably 15 to 25 delta spreads. Now long 40,000 puts corresponds to hedging 4MM shares. Using a 20 delta, one can infer that the Japanese tech fund is probably long call spreads on around 20MM shares of TSLA (~$8 billion of notional).>This ties in with the $50 billion notional of call spreads purchased by the Japanese fund across around five tech names as has been reported in the press.ELIR what half that means?

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-24 11:48:06'] Most likely is some market maker needed to clean some slides on that name and figured they weren’t gonna waste more than 3c per lot. No short gamma position can take a stock down to 0 think about it, even if the position is 10% of the market cap the most the market maker would sell is 10% of the shares assuming he was hedged on 100 delta. Not enough to get to 0.

Given the high volatility, would it be a bad idea to roll some dice with calls on some of the TBTF-type banks (CMA, CS)?eta: Looks like I missed it - the asks on most of the OTM calls for CMA just jumped. If I bought CMA April 62.50 call @ .70 when I posed this, I could have sold now for 100% profit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 08:23:00'] Hi all!  I am developing a tool to explore the options chain for all US stocks. At the moment this is biased towards selling cash-secured puts. Basically each day I download the data and process it with some filters and extra calculations. For example, I compute the (annualized) return on capital as bid/strike, link the option to the underlying's probability of hitting the strike (this is a probability similar to delta) and so on...  I am curious what do you think of this approach? What other analytics could be useful? Is this a tool someone will be willing to pay for (10-20 USD/month) if it is polished and released as a product? (At the moment I use it on my own only.)  My idea was that an application like this could zoom one's attention towards particular options to sell, after further research. Does this make sense or since it uses daily data it is already too late and there is no edge in finding possible opportunities? Or perhaps it gives suggestions, but there is no edge because it lacks certain context and price/greeks data are not enough?  Do you have any suggestions in what other venue I could ask for feedback on this?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 10:28:43'] Hey all,Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer this question!As a stock moves up the options call premium will move up and vice-versa, but how long should we wait to get the best premium? 10 minutes? 2 hours? (if i was looking to make a trade at that moment in time)I will use the open today as an example (3/14/2023) and TSLA.TSLA opened today at 177.31 and is currently sitting about 180.03 when writing this post.Pulled up the chain, and looked randomly really, at APR 21, 2023 185 premium is at 12.85 currently just for this example.Has the stock move up from 177.31 to 180.03 been fully realized in that premium or should I wait some time for it to fully adjust? Is there an easy way for options traders to be confident that we are seeing a fully adjusted premium bid and ask price when we want to sell or buy an option?This is very general. I know there are a ton of things changing all the time. The stock price is always changing and some stocks are more volatile than others etc etc.. Just looking for a general idea of when to pounce on a premium.Thanks everyone for your expert advice. Wishing you all profitable trades!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 11:38:19'] I’ve been selling covered calls in my stocks I own lately. I understand the risk in doing this is if the stock runs and you have to sell without generating the full return. However, what I’ve been doing when this happens is roll the call forward to a higher price for no change in credit. As far as I can tell, I could do this indefinitely and while it may take me longer to recognize the profits from the covered call, I would still be making more than just holding the shares by themselves. I know there is no free lunch, so what am I missing here? Is it just the fact that it limits your liquidity unless you want to risk closing the position early for a loss?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 18:12:49'] Been reading about covered calls and paper trading them on TOS,  and is not until I actually sold a covered call today on Charles Schwab for the first time that I realized I was so confused.I have one 100 shares of AI, bought at 21.88.  I decided to finally sell a covered call for practicing purposes, 22 strike 3/17/23 sold to open at .575At some point the stock today hit 21.34 cost/share and the price of the premium was .50, the P&L column showed +7.34. Then at another point price was 21.52 cost/share and P&L showed -0.16.     And this is the confusing part for me...on most tutorials I've watched/read, they talk about collecting the premium, and if the price of the stock hits the strike price, then you lose your shares. However, from what I saw on my trade today, as the price went higher, the P&L was negative. So now I'm thinking, if the price reaches 22, will the P&L be much greater than the -0.16 I saw when the price went up to 21.52?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-14 18:29:19'] I see endless comments, posts, blogs about retiring on dividends. Why isn't there more attention to retiring on options? I dedicated the first five years of my investment career trying to coordinate a dividend portfolio and tried to even them out so that they would pay out a somewhat consistent amount on a monthly basis. Once I found options, I repositioned my entire portfolio to be an all options portfolio. With the dividends, I got up to about $200 per month and with options I can easily double that consistently, with basically the same portfolio size.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-15 11:29:45'] The math makes no sense.

Here's my math, show me where I'm wrong:Sell to open $91.00 call for 2.75Buy to open $92.00 call for 2.20Assuming the trade goes against me and the stonk closes at $95 on expiration...the transactions are as follows:: + $55.00 in premium: - $9420 to buy the shares: + $9375 to sell the sharesNets +$10 in my accountWhat gives?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-15 12:32:12'] Let suppose we have very illiquid (and unreliable) options market for liquid base asset (stock / currency / …). Some models I know about (Heston 1993, SABR, … all continuous times stochastic volatility models) need to be calibrated on options prices data. And because by initial assumption this data is very poor, so the quality of calibration will be the same (I guess). I know about different phenomena’s that not captured by classical BS model (volatility surface, fat tales of log returns distribution, …). My question is the following: are there any sophisticated models (in comparison to BS; something like GARCH Option Valuation Model (Heston, … 2000)) that theoretically captured main well known options market phenomena’s (vol surface, …), could be estimated / calibrated only on the base assets historical data and the process of estimation is not very complicated / time-consuming? Let suppose, that we analyse situation from the sell-side and need to determine prices for writing the options.

What would be an optimal contract to hold though if my goal is minimizing theta decay over a two week period? For example, buy to open when a contract is 6 weeks to expiry, and close when it's 4 weeks? Alternatively, what contract timeframes do long-term, successful options sellers usually avoid since the theta isn't worth it for them? Is there anywhere I can find data like this? Ty

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-16 10:06:56'] I'm paper trading trying to learn about covered calls from a seller's perspective...As I understand, if the seller of the covered call  sells a covered call and the stock's price doesn't reach the strike price at expiration, the option expires worthless, the seller keeps the premium and the 100 shares of the stock.  Howevever, the part that is not clear to me is, what happenes if the person sells a weekly covered call on monday, the strike price for whatever reason is reached and broken through on a wed, what happens then?  So let's say the strike price was 50, and at 1pm on a wed, price hits 50, goes up to 50.10 and trends between 50 and 50.10.  4pm reaches and price is 50.05. Does the stock get assigned at that point in time and the seller keeps the premium?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 07:49:34'] I bought some $COIN call options at the beginning of the year when stock prices was trading at around $62. The options are 03/24/23 expiry with $70 and $75 strike price. Obviously markets have been volatile and these were down almost 80% at one point, but over the last few weeks the stock price has climbed and is now firmly above $70.However, my options are still down 30% and 40% respectively. I know there is a time premium but I still figured I'd be up on at least the $70 calls considering they were purchased when stock price was in the low $60's. How much would share price need to be in order for these to become profitable? Premium on both at the moment are $5.60 and $3.45 respectively.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 10:04:44'] I must be missing some risk because i know that free lunches dont exist. First of all i am talking about European options, and i pay no dividend tax.I saw a company (OCI) trading at €29,50 with an upcoming dividend of €3,50, ex-dividend 20-april.There is an call option (strike €20, with a bid price of €9,55, expiring 16-jun). So if i buy 100 shares of OCI, and sell a call option against them. I would make 5 cents per share + the dividends, if the share stays above €20.  This makes the upside 3,55. And for €0,50 i can buy a put option with same strike and experiation to cover my downside risk. Resulting in a guaranteed €3,05 on a €20,45 investment. (over a time span of 3 months)

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-17 14:01:11'] So first time this has happened because I ALWAYS set my options to close and never let them expire. I’ve short PUTs that expired today out of the money. $20 strike on FRC. I had them all set to close at $0.05 but somehow close of business there was still a bid/ask at $0.05-$0.15. On Vanguard, these options are showing up as “EXP” so I’m assuming they expired and I’m good? I’m just hoping there isn’t some odd scenario where after-market hours there is a collapse in the stock price and I get assigned somehow Monday morning…I don’t think so but has anyone ever been in this scenario? Edit: I will answer my own question because in another thread, I've learned that apparently after-hours is on until 5:30 PM time. So I suppose I'll know for sure what happens after that.

I closed it (bought back) to realize that p/l BUT I was wondering if I let it expire, it'd expire ITM (considering it was so far ITM with market close in 30m), I'd still get a p/l? The only difference would be that within those 30m I could get less or more p/l as the stock price moves? Or is letting a short put expire only a good idea when I know I'm getting assigned? I assume this logic holds for options in general?

I can sell a Apr $11 put for $3.80/$380 which would make the cost basis for this at $721 if I'm figuring this correctly.  I can also buy an Apr $8 put for $220.  Am I correct in thinking that I can sell the put, and if I get assigned which I'm likely to then I can exercise the put and still clear $160? or would it be $240? or am I missing something?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 07:58:15'] Am I crazy to think the simplest strategy for this volatile market is buying puts 4-9 months out? if i'm looking the macro-economic backdrop, the chances of a recession (or at least very slow growth) are growing. my thesis is the recent rally cannot be sustained, and we could correct. overall i'm a risk averse investor. based on what i've read about options, 2 month or less expiry is popular. however, i'm not sure when the market will begin correcting (maybe after next fomc meeting, maybe after next round of earning), hence my 4-9 month expiry strategy. i know most people will say by covered calls, or sell options, but this is my first true experience with options so i was trying to keep it simple and play to the macro trends. if this is my underlying view, my plan is to put buy puts 4-9 months out in the following: XLK, IWM, ARKK. the premium is definitely more expensive, so this is a big investment for me. before i pull the trigger, i wanted to get thoughts on this strategy. am i thinking of this too simplistically? what expiries have worked for others?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 09:31:47'] In TD … If I want to buy  1 put on SPY, exp 19 Jan 24, at 5.15 strike 275. It says the break even stock price is 270, max profit is $27,000 and max loss is $542. Does this mean if SPY goes to zero the profit is 27,000 (just as max profit is Infiniti on a call)? Also does this mean I can’t lose more than $542 no matter what if it expires worthless? In other words, if SPY goes to 430 would I be liable on margin the same way if you short a stock and it goes up you can lose infinite money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-20 15:06:40'] OP - Some people are going to say this was dumb. Which is pretty easy when we have seen speculative stocks crash the last few months. I had options that lost a lot of value around the same time. Can Tesla return to $800 8 months?  It can. I think you should evaluate your holding based on opportunity cost. You might not want to hold it if you feel better about a different holding. I would try and look at the situation like you had bought it yesterday. And, just not care what it cost. Because that is over now. Your next play however has not happened

If thats 10 contracts your break even is $823, which is way more realistic, but still a long shot.Unless there's some big news like million mile battery, big Self driving breakthrough, $25,000 car or something really big i dont see you breaking even. Cybertruck delivering wont get you there unless they find a way to ship hundreds of thousands of them. Id rather have 40 shares of TSLA to be honest, you paid a LOT of premium for that contract and you could have gotten shares at a really nice price.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-20 20:31:39'] 50/50 bro. Tesla is growing at a rapid rate and it's not slowing. Their vertical integration gives them amazing ROIC. FSD subscription will add more high margin income. Who knows what AI day will do to stock price. The big question will be the macro environment. Does market correct further?

Tesla has so much capacity coming online very late this year and 2022 should be all production so 2023 is a better bet by far. 2022 is much too soon. Price should continue to be under 900 most of the year. I have a 2100 target for Tesla during the next bull run and with the 1000 in 2023 it’s over a 1000% return. Can’t complain.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-20 17:00:00'] That was right after earnings and chances are price can move AFTER earnings. In retrospect, IF you look at 1/29/21 chart, that might have been a great date to buy a weekly call at the close at 785 or 790 strike (exp 2/5). it finished the week around $850, which would put you ITM by 60 or 65 points and you could have closed for a profit although the call might have been pricy because the post earnings vol.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-06 23:52:42'] I'm selling calls on Amazon right now and I think the returns are okay. But I've also not been doing this very long. One correction I've made to my approach is to make sure I sell the call when the stock appears to be going up in value. I didn't understand that when I first started and wound up buying back my call for a loss, twice. Another stock that I'm having luck with is UNH, though it is very expensive and outside the price range you indicated in your post. I think the basic conundrum with The Wheel is that stocks with high premiums are basically more risky. TSLA is probably the best example of this. The premiums are great, but just know that it could take a dive at any time.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-07 06:02:32'] There’s always a trade off between premiums and safety. High premiums usually implies high IV which usually implies more volatile stocks. The exception is around earnings. I like to sell around earnings on good stocks (as opposed to others) to capture the high IV but realize many times this is a bet. However when done correctly this ca net you a tidy profit. With the wheel though I always cover myself even with the cash secured put I will buy a put to protect downside. This strategy while lowering your income a bit allows me to sleep better at night. Use Barchart to screen for stocks around earnings and to meet your criteria. You have to pay for a subscription though.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 00:45:57'] Searching for stocks, consider factors like the stock's volatility, liquidity, and stability. Higher implied volatility typically results in higher option premiums, but it also comes with greater risk. Look for stocks with a good balance of these factors to maximize your potential returns while managing risk.You can look into Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). These stocks tend to have reasonably high liquidity and can offer decent premiums, though you should assess each stock's suitability for your strategy and risk tolerance.To discover more stocks suitable for this strategy, check out articles on the [best stock picking service](https://joywallet.com/article/best-stock-picking-services/).

Some will drop while others may not.Look at the 11 sectors to research the top or best stocks in each as you build your list.  I don't pay attention to what premiums the stocks pay while vetting them, but will look when it is time to trade them.  The premiums will vary so these will go up and down over time and it is more important to trade stocks that are less likely to drop and often move back up faster if they do.

Minimum Div of 2% yield, and at least $2.00 annual payout, quarterly4. IV between 25 - 755. Price between $x to $y based on your account size and risk tolerance6. Then, trending above its 200 EMA, and good bid/ask pricing. Check the bid/ask prices in the front week and 42DTE week to see strike selection and tight pricing7. Liquidity is my most important criteria, thus the need for weeklies. The div also culls out the "growth" stocks that have not made money.

Per this website and per SEC guidance (https://formthirteen.com/faq and https://www.sec.gov/about/forms/form13f.pdf ), options get reported on a Form 13F based on the notional value of the underlying stock, not based on the strike price or based on the amount actually paid for the option. Per Burry's filing ( https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921010281/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml ), he controls 800,100 shares (through 8001 puts), which control a notional value of Tesla of $534 million.  Notional value is based on the price of Tesla at the end of the quarter. Whether your contract is ATM or deep OTM, the notional would be the same. Am I missing something, or is the news about Burry's short blatantly wrong?

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-18 10:24:42'] Some of his PR moves lately have been controversial, however, they may just be Elon Musk moving chess pieces around the board.  For example, he bought bitcoin, then later said bitcoin mining might be bad for the environment.  Sure, this may be due to potential pressure from energy credits gained from selling electric cars, or, it may be a way for him to incentivize people to invest in green energy when he moves into crypto mining.  Or, it could be to increase the attractiveness of dogecoin, which he seems heavily invested to, and since he owns bitcoin, he limits the amount of bitcoin backlash for being pro other cryptocurrencies.  He also did make a profit on bitcoin.  Furthermore, Tesla has horizontal expansion, meaning, they benefit from having other types of businesses.  So, it is hard to think this is really a sink or swim moment for me, since the other option is that this is not an immature CEO being whimsical, but rather, a skilled tactician, setting up futures plays.Went all in with 90% of portfolio X2 leverage in premarket this morning at 569.63  I'm a microfish so that amounts to $17088.81.  Since I am a day/swing trader, I may not continue holding if I see other opportunities, but definitely monitor Tesla continually.

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qikrlp/is_turning_a_tsla_leap_huge_gainer_into_a_spread/'
POST_TEXT: b'Hi everyone, I recently bought a TSLA LEAP : 900 Call Jan 20 2023 and I am looking for advice on how to manage this trade, as it has run from 106.50 when I bought it just a month ago to 347.00 (\n\nWhile my outlook for Tesla remains very bullish for the next year, I am thinking of taking some downside protection without necessarily selling out of the option entirely.\n\nI was looking at selling a 1500 Call, same expiration (Jan 2023), which would net\nme 123.00, and thus reducing my cost basis to negative. This would leaving me with a max profit of 60 000$ + credit received if TSLA reaches 1500.\n\nMore concretely, my question is: would you do anything different in my situation (keeping in mind my outlook, i know a lot of people find TSLA overvalued, this is not the point of my post), or have any of you ever sold a LEAP call against a gainer as to effectively have a debit spread with a null or negative cost basis?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:21:31'] Probably better off selling your current LEAP and buying another with a higher strike. Then the cost difference is locked in gains and you still have a bullish position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:09:32'] IMO, turning into spread is not a good use of capital. Not to mention you are running into a lot of potential risks. Your spread is offsetting your gain the entire year and the long leg isn’t really doing anything. Why not just take the 225% gain of the table and reevaluate your position? You can roll it to further out leap if you’re still bullish.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 09:29:18'] Why not sell a shorter dated less OTM call like Dec 1200 or something like that? You could collect premium on more sales between now and your long expiration.I also saw mentioned to sell the long and buy a new OTM call to lock in some of those gains if your opinion is still bullish. Probably not a bad plan either.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 13:37:29'] What does "having a debit spread with null or negative cost basis" have anything to do here? If your current position has a gain, stop using the old cost basis as a reason for future trades.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 17:58:56'] Hey this post is very helpful! I’m in a similar situation with a different ticker symbol and all the conversation here is helping me work this out myself. Thanks y’all
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:25:28'] It's not a terrible idea if you expect a pullback then you have effectively made a small profit even if Tesla goes full Enron.  You take a risk on losing upside potential so if Tesla goes to 2k you miss out on 500 dollars on the upside.It comes down to your thoughts and risk tolerances.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-29 14:38:33'] I'm a simple retard, but I like selling PMCCs on LEAPS. It's higher risk but you could do this weekly or monthly and scalp gains that fit your tolerance.

POST_TEXT: b"Let's have some collective brainstorming here. From what I gathered, the exit options are (pun not intended):\n\n1. Buy back covered call at huge loss but get to keep the shares whose gain will likely be worth it\n\n2. Roll the covered call (out, out and up, etc.)\n\n3. Let the shares be assigned (and buy back the shares if want to keep in position, but significant tax on capital gains with this)\n\n4. Turn it into bear call spread by buying further OTM call\n\n5. Here's a maybe new idea: (What do you guys think about this?) Buy a call with the same expiration as the covered call but slightly higher strike price, so I'm effectively capping my loss without closing the covered call position? If TSLA drops, I can exit the covered call later since it's still an open position. If TSLA continues to rise, at least I have this new call I just bought that will rise in value at a similar rate as the covered call is incurring loss. \n\nWould this work? What's wrong with this thinking?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: "
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 18:35:18'] For future reference, don't cap all your stock with CCs. Always leave some minimum amount of delta and just manage your theta + delta. I use spreads + stock instead as smaller account, but concept is the same.IE: If you have say 1000 shares of stock, and you sell covered calls on all 1000 shares, you have effectively a delta of somewhere between 0 and 1000 shares (positional delta), and if you used say 0.2 delta calls, that is going to be around 800 positional delta to start, but as you go up, that relatively quickly shifts from 800 to 0 positional delta.If you instead sold say 7 calls at least 0.7 delta. You would start with 300+490=790 positional delta and always have at least 300 delta, and have no more than 1000 positional delta. The downside is that you have have less theta and a lower initial positional delta. You can likely solve both by selling some short puts below your current price. This would increase your max positional delta (above 1000), while also increasing your theta. Though in this case if the stock goes up enough you'll want to close your short put early as a profit, if it goes down enough you'll want to close your short call for a profit. Of course, if it goes up too much, you'll take some loss (but the gains from your stock + short put will off set it), while if the stock goes down you'll lose some money, but your calls will take money. One just needs to be careful with  how much they can move. (the ideal solution here might be to sell 100 or so shares of stock and replace that with short put(s) (or short put spreads) with similar or slightly greater delta. Keeping at least half the positional delta of the position in stock.This effectively allows you to swing trade as well. If timed well enough (or if there isn't too much movement), you can take profit on both sides.Edit: Corrected to use 790 as the total rather than 700. This brings it much more in line with what it would have been. Of course, a 0.7 delta is a bit more likely to be ITM than a 0.8 delta. If we used a 0.8 instead, it would be 860. Another downside with this approach is that it does require a fair bit more management than the standard wheel.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 15:34:50'] Isn’t point 5 same as point 4? Here is what I do, sell an ITM or ATM put to make it gut spread or straddle. Price keeps going up, I make a profit from my short puts. Price closes between C and P, the premiums on them are usually higher than their strike difference, so I keep the shares and still make money from the spread. The worst case, price drops lower than C strike and now you own another 100 shares, you can just sell another ATM or OTM call and repeat
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 16:58:12'] For people who have shorter TSLA CC dates. Have patience and roll up and out by week and increase your strike by $5 or $10 for a credit.By doing this your increasing profit of your shares that may get called away at a higher strike (even ITM) and also earn credit on premium. I have gone from 11/05 1050 to 11/12 1060 earning another $500 premium and gaining $1000 on my shares. Do this every week, until 2 things happen. Shares get assigned or you roll until the stock reverses to BTC close with minimal losses.I do not like rolling out long dates because of the situation your in OP. 2023 is a long wait. Not many will exercise to claim your shares with an option that far out. They have time to collect more premium to allow the stock to raise and also wait 1 year for long term capital gains.So in your situation, this is what I would do. If you feel bullish and think by 2023, Tesla will be $2000 or whatever it is. Accept you sold at $1200.Do Your # 5 strategy if you feel bullish. Most importantly Accept your leap (100 shares) was sold at $1200. If that leap hits $2000 by 2023. Just don’t be that person of regret.Lastly Your going to get people with the “just let your shares go or don’t sell Covered calls” but they aren’t really helping you.People who don’t want their shares get assigned. All Have similar issues.1) Tax on short term gain2) They feel bullish but the stock has gone up to fast and feels there will be a pullback.3) They don’t want to sell CSP because this may lead to another “what the hell, I could of gotten shares lower” another heartache.I hope the people providing comments, help with advice based on their experience on rolling a CC with an escape vs criticism.

All that trying to “repair” a trade you made that had the best possible outcome it could have ever possibly had.What’s wrong with that thinking is when you sell the covered call you’re signing a contract that says “I agree to give up all gains above this strike price in exchange for this premium I’m about to receive”. Now you guys who think covered calls going ITM is burning you is just you guys changing your mind about the contract you signed. There’s nothing wrong with changing your mind, you just have to pay the other party in the contract to get out of it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 17:09:01'] Close the position. I'm assuming you sold a call at a strike you were willing to part the stocks for, or one that you believed was too far to justify the stock moving up to. In either case, you reached max profit, and now that the stock moved to that price, it should even be less attractive to you to want to get into. If you do want to get into it again, just sell a put at whatever strike you're comfortable owning it at again.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 10:19:48'] In my Fidelity account I keep about 30k in SPAXX as my collateral for the options I’m selling. I noticed that with recent swings and my options becoming more valuable, money is moving from SPAXX into the margin total. 1. Is this because I selected Margin instead of Cash when selling the options?2. Is there a way to switch from Margin to Cash without BTC and then STO?Thank you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 08:09:39'] Please correct if my understanding is incorrect.  For both the below statements, assume the option is ITM at expiry. Because if its OTM, then there is no risk and it expires worthless.  Selling of naked put option is the same as owning 100 units of stock at the sell option strike price  Similarly, selling of naked call option is the same as shorting 100 units of stock at the call option strike..  Short position has a higher risk than long positions because of unlimited loss potential. I get that.  But why do people in general say selling naked options are dangerous? It is only as dangerous as directly owning 100 stocks in case of naked call sale, and shorting 100 stocks in naked put sale. Is it not?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-20 10:28:49'] Let suppose suppose that I have some discrete points from volatility surface. I want to get a continuously estimated surface from that. I have several questions about procedures. 1. Is a linear interpolation in the BS Implied Volatility space a good idea? Some sources write that such surface will not be arbitrage free, and other tell that everything is fine. Is there any problem here? 2. Is SVI a better tool for my purpose? 3. When interpolating should I use only last market data or it is better to use some smoothing history (last several hours surface / last few days) to avoid possible outliers?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 07:17:38'] I’m trying to make sense of this trade idea:UBS buys CS and CS shareholders will receive 1 share of UBS for every 22.5 shares of CS.At the time of this post, UBS is $20.32/share. $20.32/22.5 = $0.90331 for CS which is currently roughly about $0.04 below current price of CS.Why wouldn’t I buy 100 shares of CS and sell the $1 strike JAN 2025 call for $0.30 to make my CS price $0.64? I’m unsure of what would happen to the call once the acquisition goes final, but this seems like a really easy way to lock in a nice return.What am I missing here?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 07:33:11'] So basically, I kept buying options contracts that were never going to be profitable. They were always dirt cheap because they were close to expiry and way OTM. I was hoping to make money without risking a lot, but all that ended up happening is that I have a bunch of worthless contracts.I've changed my strategy and have now added more money to my brokerage. I know the whole point of options is that they're high risk/high reward, but I'm scared of putting a few hundred dollars into something just to lose it all. Any recommendations for someone like me that isn't looking for the riskiest plays? That would just like to try to make some consistent gains? Are there any stocks you've found to be a bit safer than others?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 08:31:54'] New to trading options.  I am long in a stock that I still want to keep a sizable position in.  However, I would like to free up the cash that is in the stock to use in other strategies.  Considering: (1) buying calls that are several months out to keep my position, and (2) selling calls on the shares that I have for a price I’m willing to sell.  I’m thinking that this will allow me to: (a) make money off of my current shares until they are assigned, (b) keep my position in the stock, and (c) free up some cash.  Thoughts?  Advice?  Thank you!

Can someone give me examples of threshold numbers for delta, gamma, theta when they're in our favor for both calls, and puts? To try to reword what I'm asking, I don't know when your delta, gamma, theta, Vega are in your favor, or not in your favor. It's hard to find information that's purely examples of what the numbers are telling you. Thank you in advance! So I have 2 DB 4/21 $8 puts.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 10:59:11'] Stupid question incoming.  I usually buy just calls or puts, but I wanted to try a different strategy to collect some premium.  I have x# of $1call contracts and same # of sell to open $40 contracts.  My question and thought is if I am assigned at the $40 strike, I will exercise my $1 contracts to cover the the $40 strike assignment.  With high IV, I should be able to make out good on the $1 contracts do to high IV.  Is my logic going in the right direction? or am I on a sinking boat with this strategy?  Thanks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-25 04:05:26'] I have a portfolio consisting of one, broad based ETF and a cash reserve.I use a threshold rebalancing strategy. That is, I aim to maintain a fixed ratio between the value of the ETF component and cash.When the price of the unit falls to a certain target value I buy sufficient units to return to the target ratio; vice versa if the unit price rises to a certain value.I can do this automatically by placing Buy and Sell Limit orders.Research on historical prices and dividends suggests setting quite wide price limits is optimal.So the orders are not often triggered, may be 2 or 3 times a year.It seems that I could earn extra income if I wrote put and call options on the ETF or something nearly equivalent.I would use the same strike prices as the buy and sell limit orders.Is this a viable strategy, and does it have a name?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 09:57:45'] I've been "paper trading" spy for a few weeks now. I use indicators to decide if I'm going to make a put or a call. So far my rate of success is greater than 75%. I know real money changes things, but if I can nail down a system it'll help cool my nerves.Today I wrote down put at 8:30 with a strike price of 396. My strategy is to trade open day volitility, so my exits are at 10:30.At 10:30 spy hit 395.95. If this was real and I sold the contract at 10:30, would I have made money? I looked at some online calculators and none of them account for trades like that, they all assume it's opened at the start of the day, and closed at the end. Obviously if I held till the end of the day I'd lose out unless there was a massive move in my direction.Please please please spare me the "that's just gambling speil" I appreciate the concern, but it's my money to win or lose

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 12:23:17'] Fairly new to this so hoping someone can provide some more context. From everything I've been reading the general consensus is that debit spreads are better in a low IV environment. When we are talking about a low IV environment, I assume we are talking about VIX and /VX, correct?My general understanding was that in a low IV environment such VIX being this low (it hasn't hit under 17 since January of last year), the market, in general, is more susceptible to a bounce or bullish trajectory. Why would it not make sense to utilize a bull put spread in a low IV environment? Why is a debit spread better in a low IV environment? My understanding is that you want to open debit spreads in a low IV environment and hope that IV potentially increases. Wouldn't it make more sense to open a bull put credit spread instead?

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-17 21:36:06'] Just a side thought - there's something almost poetic about TSLA kicking Xerox out of the S&P500. Xerox was one of the absolute rocketships of the 1960's. It was one of the "Nifty Fifty," stocks which *everyone knew* you buy and hold forever. (Although from its 1972 peak, it never recovered).

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-17 21:50:20'] Something that stuck with me (from cnbc) is that some funds already are maxed out (e.g. can, at most, hold 10% of their fund inam a single company  (or whatever arbitrary rules they have)) so when tesla shoots up, they are forced to sell some to keep at 10%.

This forum says that ITM and ATM options are better values.Ok, so I load it here:[https://imgur.com/kwCJrS0](https://imgur.com/kwCJrS0)This tells me that price has to get to $1.02, a .55 drop, TOMORROW for me to break even???  So if I want to make money being bearish on SNDL, price has to decline nearly 36%????**How can I make money being bearish on SNDL without price needing to go 36% in my favor TOMORROW in order to break even, because if it takes longer to do so then I won't make money or it will have to go further in my direction to make profit?  For example, if price is at $0.75 on the day of expiration, I will break even.  PRICE WENT OVER 50% IN MY FAVOR AND I MADE NO MONEY IN THIS SCENARIO.**I know, this forum says "NEVER KEEP OPTIONS TIL EXPIRATION."  Of course not.  But this put looks like it won't even make any money unless price goes beyond 36% (tomorrow) or 54% (later) in my favor.  Why would I be able to know if price is going to move that far?I am pretty sure SNDL will be around $1.00 at some point.  I am not sure it will happen TOMORROW.  But even if I buy this put and price gets to $1.10, I will still lose money.I do not want to short SNDL.  I do not want to take risk by selling calls.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-28 10:03:11'] I am unable to sell naked calls on Vanguard despite having a margin account. So usually if I want to run vertical bull spreads, I’ve to also own shares of the stock. For example, if ABC is $50 a share and I own 300 shares, I could purchase 10 call options contracts; however, I am limited to only selling 3 call options contracts.  I am wondering if there is a way around this where I could simulate a vertical spread. Hypothetically, isn’t selling ABC short by 1000 shares equivalent to selling 10 call options? So I could do 10 long calls at $50 strike and short sell 1000 shares? I suppose the big difference here is I don’t get to choose a strike price per say short selling. I would just have to close my positions all at once if my long calls are profitable.I’m not totally sure how the math works out. For a normal spread (say ABC $50/$60), the max profit would be difference of the strikes minus debit. Trying to combine long calls with short selling…come to think of it seems like a losing proposition unless you’re trying to leg out and wait I guess.

For example spy -10 contracts @ 392 and spy 10 contracts @ 391.  From what I understand this should be reversed.  In my dashboard it looks like a bull put spread but I can’t for the life of me fathom how I would accidentally enter into the bull put spread options chain when I was very clearly bearish when I entered this trade.  So I’m trying to figure out if I’m not understanding something in the way the data is presented or if I somehow selected the wrong spread.  (And also want to make sure if I were to exit the position I fully understand how to do it properly).  Thanks!
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 14:59:15'] What do you do if you have an ITM option that is going to expire, but the spread is so terrible you would lose money if you sold it, even though you made money on the option?  Like, imagine a stock is $4 and you have a $6 strike put which is trading at $0.10/2.00 or something ridiculous.  You paid $.50 for it, so selling it would be a loss.  But it's got $2 of intrinsic value.  Do you just let have the shares get called away (sell 100 at $6) and then immediately buy to cover at $4?  Is it smarter to buy the shares right before close the day on expiration in case there's a gap overnight before you sell the assigned shares?  Like it might bite if you had your $6 put expire because you couldn't sell it, and then you sold the shares at $6, and then Monday morning price opened at $100 or something.  But if you bought the shares before close at $4, then who cares if it opens at $100, because you'd still make your $2 profit when you were assigned sale of the shares at $6, yes?

I’ve already researched a bit and seen some YouTube video where they make selling covered calls seem like a guaranteed profit, which I’m guessing isn’t true. From what I seen and my understanding, if you own 100 shares of a stock, you can sell a covered call at a higher price than the current market price. This way, if the stock goes down, you atleast collect some money, and if it goes up and you are forced to sell, atleast you still made some profit. But I was wondering that other risks are involved other than losing out on the potential upside of the stock you are forced to sell?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-03 08:10:29'] I’m fairly new to Options, not new to investing, stocks, and trading in general, although I wouldn’t say that I am a seasoned veteran on the day trade tip.  I have a plethora of investments varying in risk from risk averse long term investments to high risk items…in other words, day trades on the strategy I’m employing with options will not blow my entire investment portfolio.  I have formulated trading strategy that I can remain consistent on and I trade premiums only for smaller profits but presumably less risk/loss potential.  I suppose that I am looking for a bit of confirmation that I am on a reasonable path forward with my approach and making reasonable assumptions about profit potential.      Strategy:  \-I only trade premiums (to mitigate risk).  Loss potential is only what was spent on the premium.   \-Only trade premiums on 3-4 leveraged Index ETFs utilizing SPY as an “indicator”.  I watch these ETFs daily to stay on top of recognizing trends and price movement.  I don’t really keep an eye on anything else besides these funds.  \-Each trade I make is 8-10% of account total with stops placed at a 10-15% loss (10% of 10% = 1% of account total).   \-The goal on each trade is to sell at 15% profit, if I don’t get the warm and fuzzies that it will hit 15%, I will sell early.  The way I see it is, 3%, 5%, 1.5% is all profit and profit is profit and not loss.  Are there any reasons not to sell in the green just because it’s not in the green enough?   \-In general, I try to execute 2-4 trades per week, but only when I’m confident on the direction.  I am perfectly fine with sitting out of trades to wait until I get a good feeling on direction.  \-I stick with Deltas >.5 and generally go for expiration dates that are 7-14 days out.   \-Track the shit out of everything and mull over the data of what worked, what didn’t work, etc every week’s end.   Does this strategy seem legit?  So far, I’ve had a profitability rate of about 85% and lose rate of 15%.    I’ve read with compounding it would be possible to double this account in a relatively short period of time, is there any truth to this?  I am earning around .5% - 1.5% profit on the total of the account per trade.    I see where people say they grow their accounts heavily at first and then tank and lose it all.  Why is this?  Wouldn’t scaling the same method over time continue to yield the same results?   I look forward to any thoughts, inputs, and criticism.  Let me know if I have any super wrong or super good ideas.

POST_TEXT: b"I sold some TSLA PCS 1050/1030 11/12 yesterday while TSLA was below 1200 as I remember. Today TSLA goes up to 1230 and my spread also goes up which I don't understand. Can someone explain? Thanks"
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 13:17:05'] I think some of the previous comments about delta are misinterpreting what you meant. I'm pretty sure you mean that the magnitude of the value of your spread has gone up, meaning it has become more expensive for you to close the spread, and it therefore currently shows a net loss, right?If so, the reason for this is probably IV expansion. Changes in option prices are related to movements in the underlying (described by Greeks like delta and gamma), but they're also related to changes in IV (described by vega). OTM credit spreads have overall negative vega, meaning IV decreasing benefits you, while IV increasing hurts you. The reason for this is that increasing IV generally pushes up the price of all options, but it will usually push up the price of options closer to ATM more than the price of options further OTM. Decreasing IV generally pushes down the price of all options, but it will usually push down the price of options closer to ATM more than the price of options further OTM. In a credit spread, the short leg is closer to ATM, so when IV increases, the loss on your short leg will be larger than the gain on your long leg. Similarly, when IV decreases, you benefit since the gain on your short leg will be larger than the loss on your short leg.Therefore, what likely happened is that TSLA's IV increased from yesterday to today, and this had a greater effect on the spread's price than the effect from the underlying going up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 12:47:38'] Volatility expansion causes the IV on both to increase so the spread on each leg gets wider and thus increases the overall cost of the spread
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 13:34:16'] it has to do with implied volatility.  You must understand that concept if you want to effectively trade options.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 12:43:08'] Being short a put spread has a positive delta so yea when the stock rises your position will increase in value. You want both the options to expire worthless to realize your max gain. IV changes will have an impact as well.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 13:10:18'] Selling a put credit spread is a bullish strategy. Why wouldn't it go up? Did you mean to buy a put debit spread and misclick or something?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 22:28:28'] Add the IV chart, look at a 5 minute or so. Options aren’t simply just the inverse of price movement. It’s opposite of IV crush in your case.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 23:07:53'] That’s interesting. I sold a TSLA $1080/1060 put credit spread yesterday for $1000 and it’s only worth $645 today. Mine expires 11/19 though.

Hope it drops enough to escape with minimal loss.\n\nB) roll and increase strike maybe to 1060-1080 by a month for credit?\n\nC) just let it get assigned (basically didnt gain the $7800 from 1050 to 1128) hope this week it doesnt go up to $1400.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 04:00:12'] It all depends on what you think TSLA will do over the next week. It could be one of the following scenarios:1. TSLA stays below $1130. You gain whatever extrinsic value your option has right now. 2. TSLA goes down to $1049.99 or lower. Your option expires worthless. 3. TSLA goes above $1130. In this case, you'll miss out on more gains by the stock going up than what you lose by closing out the option. Rolling is the same as taking the loss, and opening another different position. Don't let your current trade dictate where you should open your next trade at.   If you think TSLA will keep going up, close the position. If you still want to open a CC, find a good strike for it, and open it there. Don't stay attached to this one.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 04:27:02'] There was a recall on the model 3 and it didn't even make news. This was setup to pump hard.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 09:41:42'] I have an identical post. You really have two options: let them be assigned, take the tax hit for FY21 and get back in the game selling puts. Or Roll out further date by taking the credit from a new CC to buy back this call. I sold a $970 C for 11/5 and I am most likely going to roll it out to $1070 for 1/22/22. It will only cost me 1k (as of now, might collect a little credit depending on what TSLA does this week) but I have potential to make 9k more if Tesla doesn’t calm down. Then in January I can decide if I want to get assigned or roll out once again. But the main benefit here I keep my shares, cost basis and most importantly if I do get assigned in January I would pay the taxes for FY22
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 19:04:43'] If you want to hold the stock, roll the call up and out for a credit.I do not agree with the posters that say that rolling is just taking the loss. This is why...Suppose you let the current call get assigned and you end up making $8k.  If you roll the call up and out for a credit, you might still get assigned on the next call. But you'll make more than $8k. Doesn't sound like losing to me...
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 04:37:33'] Don’t feel bad, I sold $870 covered calls, also shares I’d rather not take the long term tax hit. I’m planning on rolling and collecting a few hundred dollars premium per contract (vs almost $4k at the money-Wow!). Given the spike, I think this is a gamma squeeze that we are experiencing. Excessive call buying leads to market makers buying shares to hedge if calls go in the money,driving the price higher. This should taper off in November and market makers will likely dump shares as the need to hedge goes down, bringing us closer to regular orbit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 04:56:15'] Bought $6  $1125 call after the previous quarter earnings report and the stock went no where. Option went down to 60 cents last week or the previous week. Well there went $600 I thought. Now $11 out from ITM and trading over $60 I'm kicking myself for more averaging down at 60 cents!
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 05:22:48'] You should have closed or rolled it before it hit 1000. It is now ITM and delta is high. That is why your losses are big. I sold 1200 calls expiring next Friday and planning to close or roll it on Monday if TSLA continues to go up. I will not let it go to near the money.In your case, I will close or let it assigned if you can handle the loss, and then sell puts or put spreads to offset some of these losses.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-30 08:16:18'] You've already lost on this trade. It's fine, it happens. Rolling is just a nice way to describe taking a loss on your current position and opening a new one.Nothing wrong with it, but you should be honest with yourself that you've been picking up pennies in front of a steamroller - eventually you slip.Happened to me with BB and XM earlier this year. I let BB get assigned and just took the L on XM and settled in cash to hold the shares.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 21:16:53'] Based on the Excel Screenshot:  1. Your breakeven calculations look mostly correct since it would be $6,341.41 - $15,250.56 + $17,850 = $8,940.85 (so if you could buy back the TSLA211217P00118000 @ \~$90 you would breakeven)2. If you roll to Feb 22 your calculations also look mostly correct: $6,341.41 - $15,250.56 + $17,850 - $21,560 + $25,160 = $12,540.85  (so if you could buy back the TSLA220218P00118000 @ \~$125 you would breakeven)  Remember you could also roll down your strike price (1150, 1100, etc.) when there are dips in order to free up your capital.  Otherwise, you will have to keep rolling unless you want to take the loss and purchase TSLA at $1180.

POST_TEXT: b'Weve all heard the words: Battery day.\n\nTSLA has stayed flat at 441, but only a few days ago was 420 (nice). It is less than its peak at 498, but there is some interesting chatter recently.\n\nRecently, Elon was talking about cell production at an [affordable price](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/16/tesla-battery-day-has-elon-musk-already-leaked-the-battery-tech-that-will-give-scale-to-the-ev-revolution/). His Q2 chatter led to an increase in price (after the stock split), and long dated calls have returned handsomely.\n\nSo whats going to happen on batter day? No one knows, but it is likely that their batteries will be unrivalled and the forecast is $500 09/22. Sure there are better plays, less expensive too (i.e. LI calls will do well too, [as they tend to couple](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/16/tesla-gets-two-price-target-hikes-ahead-of-tuesdays-battery-day.html)).

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-16 23:09:51'] I think the issue most retail investors are faced with when it comes to TSLA, in particular, is that buying calls even 6 months DTE is extremely cost-intensive atm. TSLA is in a high IV environment with an IVR of 55.5 and an IV% of 89.8 respectively. Typically it is not wise to purchase options on an underlying with high IV%. In this case TSLA is 89.9% higher in IV than in the previous 52 weeks (today). The 445 calls for Sept 25th (battery week) are around 41.10. Come battery week, the IV will probably increase into the 90's, making the buy-side of the options relatively more expensive. As traders, we should be looking to buy options in low IV, and sell premium in high IV. I think the real battery week play here for the Sept 25th expiration would be a long broken wing butterfly. More than likely the SP will mimic earnings and taper off shortly after. Given this is September and institutions aren't done profit-taking with the election about 8 weeks away.  ATM of me typing this, NQ futures are down 1.18% so tomorrow will probably be optimal for a BWB credit spread play or long puts @ the Oct 2nd or Oct 9th expirations if you have the capital. &#x200B;My Position: Long Put BWB (Net Cr 2.50) (Max Profit 770 if SP pins around 385 Short Puts)1 370P\-2 385P1 390P

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-16 21:48:39'] So, if TSLA sinks further tomorrow (say to 430), what are your thoughts on getting in on some 10% OTM calls in anticipation of the run up to sell late Monday? TSLA has such massive FOMO from retail I can see it shooting up Monday especially if Elon starts tweeting.

This paves the way for the Model P - an EV bus equipped with 50 Peleton bikes that powers the bus 100% with human kinetic energy.  Arrive at your destination sweaty with enough carbon credits to pay for your latte.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-17 06:34:08'] The bar is pretty high right now. Elon is a hot air pump (no offense, love tesla and have shares. But come on). If there's no million mile battery, solid state anything, or otherwise game changing announcement the day will disappoint investors. I don't think a new model of car would even be enough. My prediction is that it will be enough to satisfy current investors into not selling but not enough to create a hype train again. I expect a moderate rise up leading to the day itself (Elon will probably be super leaky this week, so depending on how juicy his tweets are it may hit some high levels) followed by a flatline after the event or a small dip if it's not what's expected. The lithium play is a huge risk. If they do end up unveiling solid state batteries then lithium is in for a terrible future. Nickel is the metal of choice if you want to take the cheaper route. Giga Metals in Canada is the current rumoured source.With battery day in everyone's sight and stars in their eyes for this new tech it's worth remembering that the stock market doesn't always do the expected thing. With the number of people piled into the battery day play a lot is priced in. Those expecting it to rocket after the event have already bought. And those who still don't have shares are probably not running to grab any because of the polarized nature of Tesla in the market. Tl;dr I'm expecting a run up prior to the event itself. Then kangaroo market after.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 10:18:25'] I feel like that's a terrible risk. Your break-even is $2,145 which is nearly 100%. You need TSLA to double its evaluation (which is already considered somewhat insane by most metrics) in a 26 month time period.If you insist on doing it, at least do a PMCC instead to get that cost-basis down. A 2023-01-20 $2000 call could reduce your cost by roughly half and then you get another year to collect more premium. If you really want to invest $14,500 and are open to the spread you could drop the strikes pretty significantly. The below position is still around $14,500 invested but instead of  needing Tesla to get to $2,145 you "only" need it to get to $1,745. * \+1 2024-01-19: $1600* \-1 2023-01-20: $1900The mid is $143.40 so you could probably fill a little lower than $145 but lets just say $145. If you get assigned early because TSLA explodes and you don't get a chance to move the short leg out, you'd make $300-$145 ($15,500). If you don't get assigned, you can keep moving your short leg out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 11:37:30'] Foolish imo. You'd be better off making slightly less money with the same thesis on $SPY.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 13:41:04'] 1. Theta is not constant, it will increase as you approach expiration. You should also be worried about Vega, as OTM options are hugely impacted by IV changes. Are you looking at just the stock chart, or the history of IV for TSLA? IV for TSLA is proportional to retail FOMO, it’ll likely revert to the mean, as it has in the past.2. Where were you when the stock was sitting at $600 a few months ago? The only reason to buy now is FOMO and feeling like the price is going to keep going up. Maybe spend your time actually coming up with good ideas rather than apeing into the hot stock and dreaming of Lambos?You’re going to risk money you can’t afford to lose on something you don’t even understand?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 14:09:08'] Question becomes how soon you need the money. Six months from now you will be crying if you listen to doubters. While agree $14K is big, the risk is mitigated by buying 2024. Sure the price can retrace but you have time to catch up. You don’t have to wait until price reaches 2K to sell the option back. My opinion would be to buy and do not look back for a year. And then make your call. This isn’t a financial advice but that’s what I would do if I have the capital that I can risk for a year. Not many get the enthusiasm people have out there for buying their cars.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 12:11:37'] Keep in mind you need it to be at $2140 or above at expiration to break even. Though if it continues to rise rapidly then it will continue to go up in value. Keep in mind those options were probably worth like a 10th of that before the current run up from $800.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-01 18:36:28'] Almost bought a CALL on the 850 strike couple months ago for roughly 4.7k was 1.7k short so didn’t buy it… now you can sell it past $27.000k USD… never doubt Tesla haha I’d say save up a lot more n work for that money then buy a 1.7k strike call years out…

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 18:26:03'] I just started looking into option strategies. I seen what you call as a long  condor spread with calls. For GOOG I seen that I can make $900 max profit  spending only $60. I set it to sell two calls at $2770 and $2780 and bought two at $2760 and $ 2790. I know this is risky because of the possibility of getting assigned but how risky and how likely am I to get assigned and would the calls I bought cover it?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-25 18:31:50'] Great spread, I was looking at this type of info but only aapl. How do you think aapl options will move this week?

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-09 09:36:21'] > the cost/benefit of alternative positions such as selling the corresponding callThe alternative position is to *buy* the corresponding call.Why are you pondering buying shares of stock and then buying a deep ITM put?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-09 10:09:49'] Title is misleading. This looks more like a maintenance margin optimization analysis on the underlying share position by using deep ITM puts.There isn't a real savings for using ITM puts. You effectively just move the maintenance amount out of the loan and into the cost of the put itself. Since the put will gain value as the shares lose value, the maintenance requirement is discounted by the gain in value of the put.To answer the literal title question, strike selection is effectively an insurance cost/benefit analysis. How much do you want to spend in insurance premium to protect how much value in the shares? Most people want to get leverage through their insurance premium, so puts are usually OTM to the current spot price of the shares. Which typically have appreciated in value over the initial cost. So the married put is to protect some amount of unrealized gains.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-09 16:38:09'] Digesting all of this would make my head hurt so I'm going to pass...    My short answer is that long stock and long a put is equivalent to a long call.  Just buy the call, avoiding extra B-A spreads, fees, slippage and more complex adjustments/exit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 14:16:51'] noob question here. I bought one lot of a silly meme stock (amc) yesterday, thinking I could play a potential share price increase and sell a deep ITM call ($1)  to lock in a small profit without having to worry about choosing a near-ATM strike and worrying about earnings results. The share price increase did not happen but I was able to sell the deep ITM call to lock a small profit. I did just this, then at close realized the two week 3/10 $1 calls are actually 5 cents cheaper, for whatever reason, than the current value of the weekly $1s I sold. Could I essentially leg into a "credit calendar" calendar, freeing up my ability to sell the shares tomorrow, then close the credit calendar for next to nothing?

Let's assume things go my way and the option will become worthless after 13-15 months. based on this link:[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/053115/tax-treatment-call-put-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/053115/tax-treatment-call-put-options.asp)>If the call is bought back, depending on the price paid to buy the call back and the time period elapsed in total for the trade, Taylor may be eligible for long- or short-term capital gains/losses. The above example pertains strictly to at-the-money or out-of-the-money covered calls. Tax treatments for in-the-money (ITM) covered calls are vastly more intricate.I know if I let the option expired, the tax is short term capital gain.What if I bought it back at $0.01 on the last day ? Will this gain become long term capital gain ? It is not 100% clear in the link I mentioned above.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 06:55:59'] I'm trying to understand why my options contracts don't have a higher return.I purchased several LAZR 8.50P on 2/27 with a 3/10 expiration. LAZR was sitting a little over $9 at the time of purchase. LAZR climbed a bit and sorta traded  sideways on 2/28 so the contracts understandably lost a little bit of value. I woke up this morning to LAZR at a 5-6% loss overnight with my options ITM. However, the price of my contracts are only up around 20% for the day and are currently still sitting at an overall loss. I feel like theta can't be the only thing at play here, so I'm wondering if anyone could explain what's happening.Edit: and now that LAZR is back to 8.5, the contracts are back their value at yesterday's close (so they didn't gain any value on a 4.5% drop overnight with price action very close to strike).

Meanwhile, an SPX contract that expires on Friday and is also just barely OTM might jump $1,000 or more based on a 2% underlying S&P gain.  Why is this?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:34:27'] Trying to understand the real risk of placing a conditional time and date market order to sell put options. I know it is an awful move but just want to understand something. Say you set a conditional order to sell 50 put contracts and it triggers at 3pm, but there are only 25 bids. So the market order would grab those 25 bids at say 1 dollar (it is likely VXX so very tight bid ask spreads usually, of 1-2 cents), But what about the other 25 you want to sell. Would a market maker or other entity notice you grabbed all the bid offers at bid price, and their computer would think "Hey that could be a big market order, so lets set a bid of 1 cent for a whole bunch" so your other 25 would get filled at 1 cent instead of closer to $1?I assume they can't see a market order, since that is just in the broker's (Thinkorswim) system and doesn't show on level 2, since there isn't a specific price to show? I'm also assuming a market order to sell would sell at the bid?Or is there some mechanism to prevent being taken advantage of in this situation, if you aren't around to set a limit based on current market.

Will I have to have collateral/insurance to allow for exercise of the long leg in order to secure Max Profit (when the contract reaches Max Profit)? I’m asking this question under the assumption that it’ll take probably up until almost 2 weeks before expiry for the contract to reach Max Profit2. Could closing out this trade be as simple as purchasing the reverse short and long legs (Credit Spread?). If yes, can I expect to have enough open interest for those strikes 2 weeks before expiry assuming the contract is ITM?

Here is the sample trade in Robinhood - https://imgur.com/a/pYsEMTJLong Put: This bearish strategy has 1 leg. It gives you the right to sell shares of the underlying asset at the strike price by the expiration date. Typically, the goal isn't to exercise, but to sell the contract for a profit before expiration. Ideally, the underlying's price quickly drops before time decay reduces the contract's value. This strategy will do poorly if the underlying's price rises above the strike price and your option expires worthless. You'll pay a debit to open this position.You're paying $720.00 for the right to Sell 200 shares of QQQ for $200.00 per share by January 19. 2024.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 13:42:47'] Hello,I have a question about how to think about trading my stock.I bought 1000 AMD shares many years ago.The cost basis is roughly around $40It is in my IRA account, so I can repurchase it without tax implications if the prices stay roughly the same or even if it moves past the strike price by a few dollars. I like to be conservative in my trading and hold these shares until 2025.Right now, I am doing a covered call spread.E.g.AMD is at 79.XXI would sell weeklies like 10 March 2023 - 85 strike, which is "0.14" delta - I get 40 cents for a total of $400.I will then buy protection at 90 for the same date, which is "0.04" delta. I pay 10 cents for it for a total of $100.My net, if all goes well, is $300.My net, if the stock takes off like crazy, which shouldn't happen every week, is $5 \* 1000 = 5000 - 300 = -$4700I can fine-tune this to a lower number, meaning lower earnings. I can have one such take-off event every 15 times I win; otherwise, I lose.This strategy allows me upward protection. I do not have downward protection at all.I was thinking of modifying the strategy a little differently and selling ITM calls likeSell 10th March 2023 75 strike - Delta of "0.76" for $4.40 - $4400Buy 10th March 2023 82 strike - Delta of "0.28" for $1.24 - $1240My net is 75 + 4.40 - 1.24 = 78.16My repurchase if it breaches $82 is 3.84 \* 1000 = $3840This strategy provides some downward protection, and the upward is too close for comfort.How do yall deal with this? Is there a good rule of thumb that I should start with? What if the shares were not in an IRA, which has tax implications?Whatever ideas you all share, I will try them in my paper trade account to get a feel before deploying.  I couldn't post this in the main forum.

POST_TEXT: b'I own 340 shares of $TSLA and and 1 2025 LEAP. What is the best strategy to sell covered calls to maximize the premium I collect? Ive been selling covered calls so I have experience just want to optimize my strategy. I usually do weeklies. Are weeklies at like 15% the best option? Should I do 2 weeklies at 15% and 1 monthly at 20-25%? Curious what you guys do.'
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:43:55'] The way I've been doing covered calls recently is leapfrogging (not an actual strategy word).You own 340 shares, so let's say you have 3 tranches, each with 100 shares, that you can sell one option on. Consider selling one covered call for next week, one for the week after that, and the last one the week after that.You will always be selling a call every week, but once the 3rd week goes by, you'll be closing or letting expire a 3-week old option for higher premium and/or higher strike than you'd be able to focusing just on weeklies, and then selling another 3-week expiry option again.Edit - I'm also doing this on a monthly dividend paying ETF. So, assuming I don't get called away, I'm making ~5% (annually) on the dividend on top of the call premium. If I do get called away, I'm totally fine with that, I'll just buy back in or spread the love to another underlying.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:54:02'] TSLA is an expensive and volatile stock for even experienced cc writers.  My point would be low delta won’t mean much.  It’s not the best underlying to learn cc strategy.  Maximizing profit means maximizing risk.  But you’ve got what you’ve got, so ensure your strike is above your purchase price basis.  Then if assigned, you’ll make profit from both the stock and the premium paid.  And lastly, you don’t have to write 3 contracts.  But if you do, they don’t all have to be the same strike.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:02:44'] .2 delta and under works decent for me.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:10:33'] Not advice, but what about selling one call 45 days out 20-30 Delta. So this every week, and close after 3-4 weeks… so you will always have 3-4 going with different expiries.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 10:25:25'] To milk premium try selling CCs 30-45 dte around a .30 delta and then close for a 50% profit to reopen at a new date and strike brings in a steadier stream of income with little risk of the shares being called away.  These will logically not run the full duration and many can close in 10 to 15 days.Milking infers a steady stream and would not maximize premium, so you need to decide which you want.  Maximize would be to sell ATM calls for the coming Fridays date, but then there will be rolls or assignments that are likely to slow down the process.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 07:57:01'] There is no "best" strategy. Absolutely depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to keep the stock and get nice premiums, you should do OTM monthlys . If you want to "wheel" it, you can do weeklies ATM and if you get executed you can go on with short puts.Your chosen strategy also depends on the course you've paid. You don't want to lose money in the end and in my country I also have to do tax planning if I don't want to pay to much of them.Check prices of several weeks. Did yesterday short 1amzn CC and the 2-week premium was "best" for me compared to the 1 and 3-week premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 11:54:42'] First you want to homogenize. Then you pasteurize. Never the other way around.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 07:45:45'] Only in hindsight will a person see which choice would have resulted in the best outcome. Is this the entire account? Or a huge percentage of the account?  If yes that is novice mistake number one, trading too big. Most suggest a limit of 5 percent in any single underlying. If the outlined position is the entire account, even one lot would violate the five percent threshold. In that case poor man’s covered calls might be a safer choice . Every choice involves trade offs. There is no best, except in hindsight. That said Captain Obvious will tell you weekly at the money generates the most premium. The trade off is constant management. With a volatile fast mover, gap moves may mean that adjustments and management can be tricky, difficult with land mines a plenty. Many find that 45 to 60 days at 20 to 30 delta to be a decent compromise between premiums and micro management. A lot is personal preference, not right or wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 08:43:31'] Another factor is what is your price point on the underlying stock?I am assuming you don’t want to lose the stock, just pocket CC premium. If you willing to let some stock go, that can be a factor in how aggressive you price your calls…if you feel the price may drop from your strike price, you could get more premium for it being closer to ITM. If it sinks below, you raked in more and keep the stock to play again. But if you up already with stock value, could be another bonus

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 08:51:27'] Tsla is so difficult to sell cc. One mth change is 1.5%, but ytd change is 85%. These days, for any cc, i use the 200 day moving avg as a guideline. I sell monthly cc around this strike or higher depending on what my cost basis. If i bought tsla at $200, i dont mind selling cc at 220 strike (10% upside). If it goes to $250 in a month, near to expiration, i will roll up and out but my rule is i will always make sure net premium is positive. If i can roll up and out to 225 strike with net positive premium, i do that. I will only keep rolling if i want to keep the stock long term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 06:10:13'] optimize how and for what?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 16:31:34'] Depending on the cost basis of your shares of course...Wait until a big move up on the share price. For TSLA, a 5% - 10% gain is not unheard of. Especially if it gets closer to $250 or higher per share or so before a major swing upward.Sell 1 CC for your breakeven cost on the shares or ATM. This is purely to Milk the premium like you want but is going to limit capital gains on the shares if the CC expires ITM. A big move upward on the share price means IV is up too, increasing the premium even more on top of what delta is doing to drive up premiums. 180 - 365 DTE is going to get you a mountain of premium too. If TSLA continues its winning streak, sell another CC and so on. If Elon tweets something or does something stupid, buy to close one or all your CCs. Rinse and repeat.Waiting for the underlying to have a winning streak and a big gain before selling lowers the risk of selling the CC too early and missing out on the premium you could have made. 180 to 365 DTE CCs also give you a lot of money up front and a lot of time (theta decay) for the chucklefucks on Wall St to eventually bring down the underlying price so you can close out the CCs for a profit. Shorter term DTE contracts will get you more premium per week but you're running the risk of the stock shooting up after you sell with each one you sell. Buy an OTM put if you want some insurance.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 18:55:30'] Longer expiry carries more risk. I will try 2 weeklies first. 1 monthly is uncertain.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 01:30:25'] Which deltas have you been using on your weeklies? Have you had to roll up and out at all? How much have you been taking in monthly on your CCs?  I’m asking because I think there’s a way you can take in around $240 a week total for 3 contracts but I’m not sure if that’s less than what you are already taking in. In addition, with this strategy, even if TSLA rallies 2 SD for the week, you would still get to keep your stock and do it again next week.  You don’t even need to roll up and out.  Pretty much you can do it every week.  The risk to the down side is the same as the CC.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 03:38:50'] I sell ATM or sometimes slightly ITM 3 weeks out in a Bear market on my long positions. I have been doing this for 12 months. Have had to roll up and out maybe 6 times. Have not lost a single share, nor lost any money on premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-05 04:10:36'] You should sell more than a week of theta on at least 1 contract. When you say “weeklies” at 15% what do you mean?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-06 17:27:06'] It depends on how badly you want to hold the shares. I don't do CCs on Tesla, but I usually aim for about 5% a month. That's still 60% over the course of a year, and it's ultraconservative so I almost never get assigned. If you have an exit strategy and understand taxes inside and out, feel free to be more aggressive. Wash rules can kick your ass if you're not careful
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-04 12:57:30'] Recommended strategy: add MACD, RSI to the TSLA chart (tradingview recommended).  If you want to sell weeklies then wait until the 1hour chart is sideways or heading down (based on price action, MACD/RSI signal line crossings).  Do not sell when it is bullish.  If you want to sell 30+ days out, then wait for it on the 4 hour or daily chart.  TSLA does not 'gap up' without indicators showing strength building.

Just ignore the references to OP everyone lolAs of market close these are your Greeks (multiplied by 100 and then by 500): * Delta = +1,470* Gamma = +20* Theta = -98,000* Vega = 4,210Call currently worth $191.00 (you’re position ($95,500)You’ve already lost $119,500You’re losing as of now $98,000 daily from theta (which will likely be higher by the end of the contracts life).To break even you need Tesla to go up somewhere in the range of $135-$145 by open tomorrow since Gamma will benefit you as it goes up. With IV30 ~20% higher than HV30, Vega isn’t likely to help you as it already decreases closer to expiration and it can’t outpace Theta at this point. If anything hope that IV doesn’t drop as that’ll just destroy your position beyond recovery.This something I would do myself first thing in the morning: Close all you’re positions completely OR and this is a profitable scenario, sell 500 $1760 calls if you have the $1,000,000 collateral available to you. Or close out what you don’t have enough collateral for and use that to sell some contracts to salvage some of your loss.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-23 12:01:52'] The picture makes no sense. > "on average users sold 13 positions... 18 contracts" so what' a position?> 2.2 wheels per userare you measuring them in inches per gallon? do all 2.2 fit into the 13 "positions"?> most popular strike prices... for a wheel. So, a trader of $AMZN, currently at $107, sells $90 strike price contracts for "wheels"? Makes absolutely no sense. The entire picture doesn't make any sense.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-11 20:59:40'] Wow, this is a very interesting trade.  I was skeptical at first because you can only manage losses but you are pretty much break even until the week of expiration - I think this is when you either close the trade or keep it open until expiration.  I would only keep it open if tsla has blown past a strike.  This is a sneaky way to get a 10% return on very volatile stock.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-11 10:31:28'] @helicon that is certainly one way to do it but not one I would do.  Then again I have completely blown up my entire account before so getting off that ride will plant some cautious seeds.  I have been writing spreads way the hell away from the action and have done quite well on TSLA.  One example is writing the 1255 vertical when it was trading at 1380.  It want up $150-200 the next day.  Cashed out at 80%. Next day I wrote the 1600 vertical.  Cashed it out the next day at 80%.  They are not retirement trades but they add up a ton especially with some size.  The initial outlay isn’t too bad and it’s easy to not worry about it much.  I have no idea what the ceiling on this stock is but it is a mover.  I hope this is helpful to you.  I also hope your account survives this bold maneuver.  Cheers
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-11 10:54:54'] You’re welcome.  If you are only looking to scrape off 20% it sounds like a viable plan.  I think the reason for so much flaming is 100% exposure on a trade.   It violates most traders risk management plan.  I am not one to discourage people from achieving their goals.  I just try to offer personal experience so everyone doesn’t have to learn the lessons I have.  As someone mentioned before the Vix crush is a concern with that trade.  Good luck with it and keep your eyes on the exit door in case it catches on fire.  👍🏼
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-11 11:38:36'] Can someone please explain to me what a reverse iron condor is? And the difference between it & a regular Iron Condor , butterfly & back ratio? Or suggest a course where I can learn ?

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-14 19:24:22'] Did you do it?  Did it work?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 23:01:27'] Just spent the weekend researching the viability of doing Reverse Iron Condors on TSLA then found this thread. It's Jan 2023 now and TSLA just spent the last year dumping from 400 to 100. Lots of movement so Reverse Iron Condors should have been a no brainer right? Unfortunately no.A mild OTM Reverse Iron Condor that needed to move 4.9% in a week for a max profit of 15% happened 36 weeks out of 52 weeks (69% of the time). That 'sounds' good until you consider the other 31% of the time the max loss was 100%. Risking $1,000 you would make $150 twice only to be slammed by a -($1,000) loss on your 3rd trade.A more OTM Reverse Iron Condor that needed to move 8.7% in a week for a max profit of 56% happened 18 weeks out of 52 weeks (35% of the time). So 1 out of 3 trades you would make $560 on $1,000 risked but the other 2 trades would suffer a -($1,000) loss each.Still going over the numbers. If I come to any more positive conclusions I will update my post.I think it pays to remember how options are priced. Your likelihood of winning is already priced into the option. They are priced in such a way the odds of making a profit consistently are against you.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-25 09:08:38'] This is just taking a large short position in Tesla. It doesn’t seem like your profit is from theta. At the end of the day there is not much time value left in this 0 day option play. Most of your profit was from a continued drop in TSLA late in the day... if it went the other way you would have been fucked very quickly by gamma before you can buy to close your contracts. Not a terrible way to be short a few hundred shares if that was your intent and you can tolerate that amount of risk.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-25 12:06:42'] If theta was that fast, it implies it was damn risky to put $600k out there like that for easy expiration manipulation. You got lucky this time, but next time an MM sitting on the other side of your trade will make it go parabolic in the last few minutes, just because they can.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 13:12:23'] It seems so very similar to AMZN in all of 1999.  This online bookstore went public in 98 and spent early parts of 98 at $2-3/share.  In June it jumped to the insane price of $20/share and most of the Financial Advisors were wondering what was happening with this online book store.   But then in fall/winter of 1998 it pulled a Tesla and skyrocketed to $80/share, holding there for a very short time and then crashed back to $50/share in Feb of 1999.  Between Feb and April it did what TSLA is doing now and skyrocketed to $105/share for absolutely no good reason.  Then over the summer of 99 it collapsed back to $45/share and everybody was bummed and many were wiped out.  But then in August through December it again skyrocked to $106 in early Dec of 1999.    That is pretty much like TSLA is today.  A price absolutely unhinged from reality.   AMZN then did a steady but consistent fall from $106/share to $6/share by Sept of 2001.   Most of the stockholders got wiped out.   However those that held finally got back to $106/share in late 09/early 2010.  Whew, what a long time to be totally underwater.  Of course since then they have become much more than an online book store and finally got some traction and actually started making a lot of money for people.   I think we are somewhere in the Amazon 1999/2000 equivalent period with TSLA.  There is much pain to come, but eventual profits for those that either buy in later and much lower or have incredible patience bordering on being comatose.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-02 15:12:47'] I don’t understand why you would buy puts just because you think the price is too high and during a parabolic move nonetheless. Wait for signs of a pullback and then load the boat. Tons of people have been wiped clean shorting Tesla because they value it as a car company - it’s much more than that.  It’s a disruptive company that literally created the EV space and is at the forefront of autonomous driving, which will change the world even more. Long term this will keep going up and dips are buying opportunities. Short term it’s over-extended but don’t try to call the top, you will get burned.

It might be engineered or maybe it’s just coincidental due to the uniqueness of Tesla options, but whatever it may be, it’s actually means it can literally go to 2000+ with no change in fundamentals. And of course, you should never buy puts on it. Even when you are right, you would have won a much higher % of the time on SPY puts.

WHEN not IF, they produce a $30k car - no one will ever buy another camry, accord, or Prius ever again. The other EV companies simply can’t catch up. If you still don’t get it consider this - they are not just selling a car. It’s an experience. Everything from buying the car (not haggling with some no college degree car salesmen in a cheap suit)  to all the features in the actual driving, its luxury, performance, and technology you don’t get even with the high end european cars. It’s not a car. Just like your iphone is not a phone.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-24 23:54:14'] TSLA is not a good first time options play. TSLA is absolutely unforgiving. If you do it, make sure you have a well defined exit plan and a stop order in place.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 06:13:40'] That’s a very expensive contract with a very low delta and very high breakeven… ballsy, hope it works for you. I would have bought a LEAPS instead if I wanted to make the same bet as you

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 02:47:19'] Just want to say every comment on here is just an opinion. Nothing wrong with TSLA leaps if you’re bullish over the next several months but my advice for buying something far out is just to make sure that IV isn’t toooo high. Low IV is best time to pick up long term options, so tickers like aapl that have barely moved in months are nice
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 04:17:39'] I’m bullish on Tesla but that’s a difficult call option. Breakeven is close to $830. Not impossible but kinda improbable. What I would do is do some calendar spreads to help get some premium back and hope q3 or q4 is a huge earnings beat.

I too have got my fingers, hands, face and butt burnt on a TSLA play and have said farewell to my hard earned, but letting the trade play out as perhaps Elon finds gold on the moon before the trade expires or maybe TSLA bitcoin reserves quadruples and fossil fuels catch a virus..

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 21:10:15'] Theta will eat away at the position to the tune of $20~ a day everyday. TSLA is more than capable of cracking over 760 anytime, but I personally am more bearish until their semis are rolling off the production line.If I had a bullish sentiment, as you do, I would have picked a price target of... say 850 and opened a bull debit spread. Buy the 750 call, sell the 850 call (or whatever your price target is) against it with the 3/18/2022 expiration. Theta would have taken $1.19 a day and cost of entry would be $2100~/ contract, so with the same capital you could have 3 contracts.With that said, I hope it works in your favor and you can show all us nay sayers how its done! I applaud the size of your nut cup. Good luck!
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 06:03:04'] at least you have some skin in the game if it does go up.it’s been a tough 6 months for tesla though.i’m sitting on some 1000 calls that will probably expire worthless but they weren’t very expensive (probably for good reason)if you are lucky to be able to make a small profit, i would say to take it and maybe roll it to something else
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-25 17:48:38'] Both Ford and GMC are introducing new 2022 EV pickup trucks. Both have fully developed dealership networks, unlike Tesla..

They release the earnings after the bell and the stock shots up over 20% but you believe the stock will come back down and not be as high the next day. Since you can't sell the call after hours does it make sense if you have the cash to exercise the call early before the brokers 4:30 cut off and immediately then sell the shares after hours? Do you get the shares right away if you exercise early?

But if I use the profits from premiums, whether a it’s from CCs or CSPs to buy those shares, can I consider those shares "free" in my own cost basis? For tax purposes it would use the broker’s average but for your personal cost, would it be fair to say those shares are free since you didn’t actually go to a job and work for that premium?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 12:47:24'] Now, I have a question about the stock repair strategy.  From what I saw on an article, say you are down 50% or so on a stock.  What you do is, buy one ATM call for every 100 shares you have, and then go .50 of the way between your ATM price and the average cost you have, and sell two OTM calls there for every 100 shares you have.  So for example, if your average cost is 30, and price is 20, you would buy one 20 call and sell two 25 calls.  The article said that you should try to do it for as close to no cost as possible, or sometimes you even get a credit.Anyway, while I've been looking around at this, I have not even seen a single case where doing so would be even close to zero cost.  I have been using all sorts of various numbers, and in no cases is buying 1 ATM call less than 2x the cost of ANY OTM calls.So does this even work?In every case, the ATM call is like 3x or more compared to all OTM options.  So you cannot do it and have it cost nothing, or even get a credit.  What's the problem?

Since it's tax advantaged, you don't incur any taxes if get called away at $250.EDIT: got math mixed up.  It's a credit of $740, but that's mostly moot.  It's more about the protection of up to $200K notional at the expense of capping it at $250K.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-14 20:18:31'] Is there a more efficient way to do this if I am bullish?Currently, rather than doing the 3x ETF's for SP500 (SPXL) I have been doing Synthetic Longs at 300% of my account.  Here is my calculation with a hypothetical 10K account with the regt margin and SPY being $100/Share10K × 3 =30K 10K cash 20K marginSPY 100/share 30K would buy 300 shares /100 (contracts worth 100 shares) = 3 contractsSo I open 3 Synthetic longs at the nearest ITM Strike  with an expiration within a month. I close the trade when the underlying has increase or decreased by 3-5% or the day before expiration. Is there a more efficient manner I could be trading in this manner and still getting the resultsnof 3X? I like woth the synthetic if I am wrong and it went down I dont lose everything, but it's just as if I had bought 300 shares, the same as the gain. What about in an IRA with no potential for margin is there any place for setting up something similar to leverage in those or am I better off just buying the 3x ETFs in there?

Is turning that into a debit spread by selling a call at a higher strike price a decent way to secure profit? Am aware it would limit your profit based on strike price gap but seems an appealing way to at least secure your premiums back while still allowing larger profits. Vs buying a put where you have to pay more to secure profits.

I was, and still am, comortable with the strike I set on the option, but I'm struggling with a decision close out the option and sell the underlying. Looking to see if I'm missing something here. The way I see it these are my choices1) Lay down until the feeling goes away. I have time until expiry and the stock could retreat back towards ATM or OTM2) Lay down until the feeling goes away. The stock continues ripping. The option expires and I get my strike and I tell myself no one went broke selling at a gain.3) Close the option now and take the loss, but also sell the underlying to take the increased gain (don't want to just close the option and hold because if it DOES retreat I'd be punching myself in the face twice.4) I could roll but I don't love the idea of chasing the stock.It's ABNB strike 130 April expiry.

I understand that open interest equals the total number of bought or sold contracts, not the total of both added together. But I do not understand how OI goes up when price goes up as well would be an indicator that there are now new longs added to the market. Because by the same token you can say, there is also same increase in seller. Am I missing sth from the picture?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 04:28:38'] I'm sure this should be solvable on Google, so apologies, but I can't really seem to find the answer I'm looking for.   Question is regarding having options assigned against you when selling call options.   I'm trying to understand from a very practical perspective the way in which having options that you have sold assigned works. Obviously I understand the basic theoretical in that  the purchaser of the call options is increasingly likely the exercise, the further past the strike price the options go.  But in a purely practical sense, what does this look like as the seller? Using a hypothetical and saying 1000 call options total have been sold for TSLA at 250 for March 17th, and say it's currently March 1st and the stock now sits at 350. Obviously, assuming the stocks don't plummet, the options are going to be exercised at some point. But let's say we have personally sold 20 of these call options (the other 980 having been sold by other sellers on various exchanges).   Do we simply run the risk that the specific buyers of the 20 calls that we have sold will choose to exercise their options at any given moment? How could it be distinguished which specific call buyers have the right to assign the specific options that you've sold? Can you wake up and find that half of the options you've sold have been exercised and the others have still not? I understand that assuming the stocks do not fall in value they will need to be delivered at some point prior to expiration, but the question is how this actually looks in practice.If anyone could spell out how this actually looks from the perspective of the seller, I'd be grateful. Thanks

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 09:07:04'] For the past year or so I've generally been able to find some small amounts of hidden liquidity/better fills when buying & selling OTM long-dated options. I'm familiar enough with a range of stocks (I've placed thousands of orders) that I could usually guess where I might get filled & recognize general consistent patterns.  Since Feb 6th or 7th, this seems to have completely dried up. Spreads have gotten wider and/or weirder across the board, no matter the ticker or expiration date. I know these things change constantly but I haven't seen it everywhere all at once like this before. Seems almost like the market makers don't quite know how to price things right now.  Just curious if anyone knows any event or anything that would have taken place in the first week of Feb that would change things up so much? Or if anyone else has noticed the same thing?

Most like I will choose the wrong words to describe this, so yeah... :)Why is the... implied price(?) the same for every option strike?For example.Stock ABC is $50.a 49 call is $1.50 (breakeven is $50.50)a 48 call is $2.50 (breakeven is $50.50)a 47 call is $3.50 (breakeven is $50.50)etc.So it doesn't really matter which call you buy because they're all PICKING THE SAME PRICE.Puts do the same thing.a 51 put is $1.50 (breakeven is $49.50)a 52 put is $2.50 (breakeven is $49.50)a 53 put is $3.50 (breakeven is $49.50)So they're all basically the same, it doesn't matter which you buy, because breakeven is the same price.This doesn't apply for OTM options obviously.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey everyone,\n\nJust wanted to share this idea on taking profits on a butterfly spread, while still staying in the trade.\n\n* When we buy plain naked calls, we can take profits by rolling it further (eg: Sell 20.00 call for a win, buy  the 25.00 or 30.00 and stay in the trade for more upside).\n* Similarly, I am sharing this adjustment where we "NARROW" the wings of the butterfly for a CREDIT.\n\nLast week I opened this TSLA Call Butterfly Spread for a $1.00 DEBIT.\n\nThis is 100-points wide, and I just paid 1% of Max Profit to open it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-15 16:31:40'] I do not use TastyWorks, but their concepts on opening/closing trades are all based on documented probabilities.   TastyTrade data confirms the greatest annualized returns (the only rational measurement of trading success) on average comes from entering GTC exits on butterflies at 25% of max profits.  The other major advantage of this - you spend no time managing winners.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-15 19:22:56'] How does this work? You first place the 100pt wide butterfly order and once the order is executed, later you do adjustment order the same day? I am confused on the sequence of these.

And what if your calls are OTM due to huge dip but its climbing back, can you reduce your risk by selling current for a loss and buying back? Sorry I'm still very new to this options trading.  But on topic, in what event does narrowing the wings of a butterfly allow you to take profits?  Is it after a certain amount of time has passed say 1-2 weeks where the stock price is still in between the wings, in a 4 month DTE?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-15 21:13:42'] So your max profit is if TSLA goes to 1000 with the old spread right, this would be a bullish spread correct?

The amount of people playing games with options and margin accounts is baffling and it may take a while, but it will end badly. My advice, sell the position, close your margin account and if you like Tesla then buy back the shares you can afford because I’m assuming you don’t know how margin works if you don’t know how options work.

This may not apply to you but good to know, if you can't cover the cost of 200 shares of tsla between capital and available margin and the share price drops tomorrow premarket, on open robinhood will sell all 200 shares and liquidate your entire account for a potentially massive loss.  Possibly making you go negative. This video is about a similar situation it will help ya understand what I mean by this. https://youtu.be/rtVFj9nRRDo If you have enough in the account to cover the shares than you're totally fine and have nothing to worry about.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 20:28:48'] Personally I would sell 20 of them at open. Make sure you set a limit order in between the current bid and ask or you’ll get near the bid. I’d let the other 10 run for a good portion of the day if Tesla continues up. Sell 5 more around noon (central) and then the last 5 around 2pm (central). Always set a limit sell order in the middle of the bid and ask if the spread is wide.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 07:22:23'] I hope you sold them all at the open.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 21:15:17'] If you exercise the option (i.e., do not sell) then you would be buying 1.6 MM shares of TSLA on margin at strike price. I hope your margin account is big to accommodate 1.6 MM x $500.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 21:39:39'] Yeah don't wait. I've had several earnings plays go in my direction, I'd be up a couple hundred% and I waited thinking it'd go higher only to lose all my profits. Don't be greedy!
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 21:56:59'] Congrats on the bet.I usually sell on increments. Sell 50-75%. Let the other. 25% ride or sell before close.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 23:03:30'] i would sell at least 20-25 at market open. normally i would say sell all at market open, and that is also a fine strategy. you can’t go wrong with that.however, TSLA has been known to run up a LOT. it’s not out of the question for it to hit 600 tomorrow. but it’s equally likely that it drops below 500. so it might be worth gambling with a couple and cutting them loose before the day is over.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 07:21:43'] Hope you sold at $515 peak.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 07:58:32'] Hope you sold at open man
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 20:33:46'] You can sell to close the contracts.  Tomorrow when market opens and assuming TSLA is the same price or higher (price can change pre market) then the option contract premium will update and you should see a new price per contract.  And you can then choose to sell to close those contracts.It’s hard to say how much gain there will be considering tomorrow is expiration and how the market reacts to the 81 bump in after hours.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 08:47:19'] I hope you sold at open my friend
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 09:05:17'] I saw this post on wallstreetbets. Why did you buy 20k worth of 1 day TSLA options? This is like pure gambling even if you made money on this trade.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 00:21:08'] Had something similar to me, although my account is a bit smaller. Transferred some money to my IRA account, so my main trading was back to being small again. Left just enough $ i figured I'd YOLO a solid portion into a Option for one of the top trading securities. Hadn't traded TSLA in awhile, was playing around on the options chain, found a position that seemed appealing and bought it. As soon as i bought it i realized i had made a mistake. I was originally looking for 4/24 calls, but after changing some of the viewing columns up on the options chain, i guess the page reloaded and defaulted on showing 4/3 options instead of the 4/24 positions i was just at. Accidentally bought a 505C for 4/3 as opposed to 4/24 like intended... From market open  to close today i was constantly wondering if i should cut losses and sell it while i could, or grow bigger balls and hold it through.I held it through and watch my portfolio drop all day. After hours trading, my portfolio ended getting to 40%+shit was hilarious to be apart of. Gonna be rolling in some tendies tomorrow whether i close at open or later in the day

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 09:56:15'] Update?
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 22:46:45'] Interesting a lot of people are saying that it will exercise... you BOUGHT a call right? Meaning that gives you the RIGHT to exercise not the obligation. If you had SOLD a call and it was ITM then yeah you would have to sell X amount of shares of TSLA @ $500(only if the person that bought the call exercises). Depending on your Brokerage if you have the capital then maybe it would auto exercise but some will sell, others will send a Do Not Exercise request to the OOC and will simply let it expire and you lose the premium, of course. Check with your Broker to see what their course of action is! Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 06:46:17'] Hope you slapped that sell as hard as you could at $510
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 06:48:21'] If you are holding ITM call options it is more economical and you’ll make more money by just selling the options on the open market. They still have IV and time value that adds to the value of the options above what you would get for exercising them. Plus then you don’t have to deal with actually paying for a boat load of TSLA shares.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 23:37:39'] Unless you have the cash available to exercise, the broker will ayto-sell at whatever price they determine. Probably a sloppy market sell 1 hour to close.Just sell during the day or open, find a good exit. Nice one.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-02 23:46:03'] Sell and take your profit is the obvious. Depending on your brokerage they will auto a BTC order a few minutes before close since u ain't got the margin to exercise it. But yea just sell it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 02:05:14'] With all the volatility in the markets today, I would get these off your hands right at open to lock in a nice gain. Its possible that TSLA keeps ripping up all day but nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Especially since the past few Fridays have tended to have a fairly large sell off in the afternoon going into the weekend (speaking on the market in general, not sure how TSLA has tended to follow the overall market, as I don't follow it too closely).
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-03 03:13:41'] I think so, yeah, but I’m not sure on that. Mine doesn’t. Though.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-12 15:49:31'] It seems a critical moment of your decision making was when TSLA regained the bottom level of the wedge after it first broke down.Is that true?Because normally a downward break on that wedge is "bearish"? Yes?And so whether at the 3m chart or just because you wanted to wait for it to test that 700 support....you seemed confident once it regained the lower-wedge that it would break upward?Explain.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-27 09:55:19'] Well, tsla 5 year notes yield about 4.5% now, which is almost 4% more than treasures. Looks like if you sold a cash secured put with two years to maturity you'd need to put up $100 in collateral and you would collect premium $5 while you wait. The bond seems like a slightly better deal. So, I would say the put option is trading somewhat cheap. Maybe someone is selling those and buying the bonds, trying to make a 1% yield spread arbitrage.

Funds are probably going to sell off some pre market, and retail is probably going to panic sell early, so TSLA probably going to drop abit, but people probably going to buy the dip, so this is abit of a i guess scary situation, i probably won't be play it tho

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 09:40:19'] If you update it with current prices, using the bid side for sold options and ask side for bought options (where your most likely fills are), you're actually only up \~$378 as a maximum return (at TSLA = $0) after a little over a year  Capital requirements would be around $7551 for around a 5% 1 year return  You could use the same money and just buy a treasury bond without the risk of early assignment on the short call. The 1yr treasury yield is currently 5.1317%, so actually better than this trade with less risk.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 13:13:41'] The Conversion. Rarely openable to your advantage.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 14:32:15'] I don't think those prices are reliable, looking at schwab and tastyworks it seems like there is no liquidity and the actual return you would get would be about ~480 and making the debit closer to 7.5k.  makes the return about ~6.5% which seems closer to risk free rate and makes sense it would be about there given option pricing models.  I was actually kinda curious about this kinda strategy and just asked about it in another subreddit since it seems like if you could get it to work (not even the put part but just selling very deep ITM leap) it seems like for dividend stocks it could 2x the yield for the money tied up which on something like $MO seems almost worth it. main issue is trying to figure out how dividend risk would impact it and no liquidity meaning the prices you see that make it seem enticing are probably nowhere near what you will be able to execute at.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 17:28:20'] Seems like not many know this, but options actually trade based on the *forward price* of a stock on the day of expiration, not on its current stock priceThe formula for the forward price of a stock can be easily estimated by taking the current spot price - dividends + interest (options models assume all cash spent on options is borrowed). If you compare this forward price to the breakeven of the synthetic long/short (using liquid options), they will typically be about the sameUnfortunately, the options are priced near perfectly in liquid markets, and this is not a form of arbitrage
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 10:17:27'] You are missing opportunity costs
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 15:28:10'] Where is the arbitrage?Edit:  What your order will most likely do is trigger the Show or Fill rule and your offer will become the new spread, but it won’t fill.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-07 17:22:00'] Your risk is early assignment and then it moving against that suddenly. In addition, these are tough positions to fill on a single ticket. You might need to leg in, which introduces additional risk

Looking through the option chain for Tesla, I see a 1.67 call for 134.97/contract (expires March 17). Couldn't you just buy the contract (134.97x100 = $13,497) then exercise it immediately (1.67x100 = $167) so 167+13,497 = $13,664/100 shares = $136.64/share. Then sell your shares immediately at the market price of $173 or so? There must be something I'm not getting here.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 22:27:18'] The market has terminology for almost everything so I have to ask. When a short Call or Put goes ITM, is there a definitive term for the difference between the strike price and the assigned price?    I use my own visual slang for this measure. For short PUTs, I use the term "blowthrough" as in it blew through my expected strike and landed in my account. For CCALLs, I use the term "spew" as I picture all the dollars I missed out on spewing out the top of my strike price into the air.  Slightly stupid sounding I admit but it helps me keep the numbers straight in my head.     As a further example. If I have a CSP on XOM for $100 and it expires ITM at 99.00, that's $1 (and 1%) of "blowthrough". If I have a CC on XOM with $100 strike and it expires at $101, that's $1 (and again 1%) of "spew". Since I'm running a modified wheel strategy, limiting both of these numbers is my goal. I'm just wondering if they have actual accepted terms in market parlance.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 18:15:15'] Hi guys,  I just want to learn a little more about options trading, particularly covered calls. I have XXX shares of a stock and been selling weekly covered calls +5$ above the current price.    My question is - what happens when my covered calls go "ITM" (In the money), and the "person" who bought my calls, doesn't have enough funds to exercise? Does this mean it just expires worthless and I'm off the hook? Or does the broker just exercise on their behalf and pocket the difference? I think that last sentence is my misconception. What happens to the ITM covered calls?    Thank you for your time. Sorry if this is a stupid question. I've read that there's an X% chance they get assigned, and I've read that ITM covered calls are always exercised if ITM. I'm just really confused at this point.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 10:07:03'] Do brokerages have a setting so that if you have a Put that expires ITM, an automatic buy is simultaneously  triggered using your free cash to satisfy the underlying sale to the other party...so I don't end up short the stock if I'm not around the morning after? It's VXX which is pretty high volume so buying that underlying automatically to sell, at mid or mid less a penny is pretty safe (1 cent bid ask spreads usually), if  I can set that.But is this available? What is the term? I tried "Automatic closing out of executed opiions" but results are about strategies for exiting early. I trade at IBKR and TOS but I would open and account elswhere if need be.

SPY stays about the same all day and at 4:10pm (in that 15 minutes after market close window when liquidity is sparse) SPY is at $400.30 . With 5 minutes to go, would I have a better chance of closing only the 1,000 SPY calls at $0.31 each, or the 1,000 full straddles for $0.31 each?  Basically would adding the put that's valued at $.01 help or hurt my ability to exit the slightly ITM calls with almost no time left  Thank you for any responses!

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 12:36:00'] I have a short strangle for May. Stock's been marginally trading sideways, but got a notice from my bank I'm at 90% of my account. At 100% I'll get margin called. Closing the call-side of the strangle, would set me back substantially as this hasn't been lowered much. But could I buy some call options for an earlier date to cancel out that short position on those calls? This wouldn't cost me as much, and looks like a safe bet to me?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-01 13:42:36'] I placed a short vertical on SPX right at Powell speech, I ended up being completely wrong and should have lost money, but the trade profited way over the max profit, what did I do wrong?I thought the market was going to spike briefly and then drop after JP's speech so I set up a short vertical spread with two triggers (a stop-loss and a take-profit). I was way wrong obviously, the market rallied, but somehow my P/L is $17,100???  As you can see below, I sold ten of March 10 SPX vertical at 4110/4120 strike, at a 6.00 limit. I set a take profit at 3.00 limit to buy back the contract at 50% profit, and a limit stop loss at mark price of the underlying at 4110 with a limit offset of 0.10 just to ensure I would get filled (so that my max loss would be nearly equivalent to the credit I received from the spread).  Anyway it gets filled and the market instantly starts ripping upwards. I was disappointed but did not close early, had already decided to leave emotions out, stick to my strategy, and either let it hit my stop-loss or my take-profit.  So SPX promptly hits 4110 (which was my stop loss) and I go to my positions to see the damage, only to find that not only are ALL THREE of my positions are somehow open, but my profit is over 10k. After a long confused pause I scrambled to close my position.  I entered a closing trade for all 3 and they get filled, but then after looking again to make sure, I still have an open bought vertical somehow?? I fumbled around thinkorswim for two minutes with panic rising and unable to understand what I have done, figured I had to just close the position so I picked the opposite of my position and just blindly submitted it at the default mark limit, and it filled quickly.  Now finally with all the positions closed I am looking at $17,100 profit in about ten minutes. What have I done? I don't get it at all. It was a short vertical spread so understand that my MAX PROFIT on this trade should have been 6k, and that was only if SPX stayed below 4110 all the way until March 10th and then the contract expires worthless, which wouldn't have happened anyway because I set a take profit at 50% so my max profit if I absolutely nailed this trade should have been 3k.  Entry:   SOLD -10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/13.70Stop loss: BOT +10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/1.00Take profit: BOT +10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/1.00closed my accidental open position: SOLD -10 VERTICAL SPX 100 (Weeklys) 10 MAR 23 4110/4120 CALL u/5.40

How do you set these up?I got an email from Schwab suggesting that I might like "Cash-Secured Equity Puts" based on my account activity.My investing strategy is pretty straight-forward. I set multiple limit orders at today's price less a discount of 5/10/15%, good for 60 days.For example, I want to purchase an ETF or a dividend aristocrat stock XYZ which has a 52 week trading range between $80-110 and today's price is $100. I'll set limit orders of $95, $90, and $85, all good for 60 days. If the market dips, then my orders will execute and I'll buy at a discount. These investments will be held 30+ years.I repeat this activity every 60-90 days, or whenever I have time. Schwab is suggesting that I try Cash-Secured Equity Puts because that's essentially what I'm already doing but not receiving the trade premium income ... or something like that.Can someone please "explain like I am 5" how to set up a cash secured equity put for the above example?Full disclosure: I am a CPA & MBA but also an idiot.

So if my put ended up ITM and triggered a sale, I wouldn't end up short VXX, but rather my long itm call would trigger a simultaneous buy to offset? I know my concern about avoiding assignment isn't a great reason for a strategy, and the move/down gain on put would be offset by call value loss, but the premium difference would be what I was looking for....VXX puts often underpriced IMO.Am I getting the mechanics of this right, and is there a name for it?

Reading up on how things work made me fairly confident I knew how selling options worked but for my first go I didn't want to risk much in case I was mistaken or didn't know how my broker's app worked or something like that.I bought it back a month later for a very small profit (sold at $36, bought back at $29) once I felt confident in things and wanted to use the money elsewhere.Not sure the motivations for all the other buyers/sellers but that was mine if it helps your curiosity
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 11:54:29'] I wanted something like 700, but having a hard time finding them at all

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 13:30:11'] There was some really strange option activity today on TSLA (per usual). 31,084 100p at the ask @ .06 exp 7/241,035 and 789 2000c at the ask @ 1.70 exp 7/17.Even if Elon Musk died and all of TSLA’s facilities blew up, the 2000c’s should have a higher probability of being ITM at expiration than those 100p’s, much less 5p. Let’s say for some reason there was a cataclysmic drop and you had to buy/cover, the loss could be life ruining. That tiny probability alone keeps me from shorting naked options. Like others have said, you’re better off buying T-bills or high yielding equities.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 14:25:27'] Do it, if you're wrong you just go bankrupt, along side Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 14:34:18'] Your potential max loss is about $1 million, right, assuming it goes to zero? I'd imagine you'd be able to exit for less before things completely implode, but up to you if you want to risk that.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:21:18'] Only advice is whatever buying power it says it needs, make sure you have double. Twice now I’ve had OCC double buying power requirement for naked options, forcing me out and forcing me to realize loss. Other than that I do this from time to time when I like the return and the company. I used to make 50% off $50 TSLA put leaps.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:47:52'] The 3500 7/17 went for >0.60 as late as yesterday, 4 days to expiration. Better bet
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:50:14'] Sounds more safe than the safe
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:51:40'] Your logic is correct. You can be obligated at any time to buy $TSLA stock for $5.00/share. It closed today at $1,546. That would be a 99.67% pullback.It is virtually unthinkable on July 15th, 2020, however, as others have pointed out, if it were a sure thing that it wouldn't exercise people wouldn't be taking the other side of the trade. If Tesla were to Enron itself and completely disappear in two years (anything can happen, I suppose, and you don't know what you don't know) your max loss would be $500 - $24 = $476 per contract less commissions paid to STO.The best case scenario is you make 2.4% nominal per year. The average market return is 8-11%. I don't like to use the phrase "picking up nickels in front of a steamroller" but this really seems like it. Because you face the risk of near-total principal loss to get a sub-market return, whereas with a CD you do not face the risk of loss of principal AT ALL (FDIC insurance).You could sell $5 puts on plenty of other stocks, I do cash-secured puts in my portfolio and sometimes when I have like a grand left I'll sell two Ford $5 puts just so that more of my money is working. I have owned Ford before and wouldn't mind buying it for $5, but I've also held it and watched it do nothing so I'd rather wheel it than BTH.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:51:49'] I don't know about a 1% return in 2 years. If that's the case, I'd rather put my money into MSFT.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 15:55:05'] The thing is with a CD or treasury return they are more liquid. A CD you can cancel and get your cash back just no interest. You can't necessarily get out of the puts you sell as easily.If you want to just lock in money and for sure don't need it's ok.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 17:21:37'] This is a good play in terms of risk; however, the issue is you can't take the earnings and reinvestment them. The money is locked up for the entire duration. Also, if inflation creeps up that is the biggest risk.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 17:24:26'] $500?  Your broker is making you put up the full $500? Etrade only charges me 35% of the option strike on naked TSLA puts which would only be $175.   Of course Etrade has changed their margin before on me in the middle of a trade, but might be worth it to switch brokers and buff up those returns.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 18:35:59'] Don’t go that low. Try maybe 300$ or something. Sure there’s more risk. But also much more return
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-16 06:40:15'] So for selling these PUTS, you need just $500 ($5*100 Shares) in collateral per contract "locked up"? Very tempting, but as others noted, with more time & effort you can probably make more selling waaaavy OTM PUTS w/ shorter DTEs.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-16 08:46:31'] Did this guy know about the hack, lmao?
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-16 10:16:23'] You are forgetting the risk of margin calls. TSLA doesn't have to go to zero for you to lose. But if the price crashes a lot, say after a bad earnings calls, then these options can easily go up 5X in value. And you will have to hold a good amount of money in your trading account to cover that, which destroys your IRR.EDIT: I am wrong. See reply thread below.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 13:21:35'] lol. A fire at the gigafactory is going to make you homeless.. But you do you.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-15 12:58:33'] I suspect people are buying these not selling them. Tesla books their car sales up front so if people default on their payments the company would be in trouble.In other words, Tesla says they are making $55k on a car sale but the individual is probably financing it, so there's a bunch of money not in the bank. This is a bet the economy tanks and takes Tesla with it, or at least those options will double or triple in value before expiration.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 07:40:48'] The hardest part for me is knowing when to take profit and start again. Greed always tells me I’ll get the 300-400% gain then I end up holding it to zero. The long calls seem to work better for me. Gives me more chances to sell and actually take profit:
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 16:58:22'] Trying to learn. Be kind. I was looking at options with unusual volume.  Found a call 25% out of the money with over 50,000 in volume and only 40 open interest.  Explain that to me. Did a bunch of options get exercised ?  But why would they do that out of the money?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 17:19:20'] I've been dabbling with options lately, mostly CC and calls or puts. I've also invested in stocks over a couple of decades. I was lucky enough to get into tsla early and I have faith long term, but was curious if there's an option strategy I should research to access some cash without losing shares. I did sell some covered LEAPS which went way in the money and gave me a heart attack, but I held and the recent plummet saved my shares. In retrospect, perhaps being exercised would have been great :) Any pointers at what a newb should look into? About 2k shares held long-term.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 10:39:15'] Hi. I am very new to options. I THINK I understand a basic call option. I did a small one last week and made a little money. I am now trying to verify how a call option works if I am ITM and decide that I want to exercise my option early and buy the stock.  So I made up this example just to be sure I have the steps and results correct to do this… I know my numbers are not realistic, but I really just want to make sure I understand the process.So here’s my example:XYZ Corp currently trading at $10/shareBuy 5 call contracts of XYZ CORP @ $2.50 each with a $6/share strike point = $1,250.00 Premium paid 1 week later: XYZ Corp trading @ $12/share - I choose to Exercise my option to buy the shares. Cost = $3000.00Now here’s where I get confused: when I exercise to buy, I think it’s different than if I just sell for the contract profit. Right? So I’m not sure how much I get for owning the contract for 1 week - so I’m just going to make up a number and say I get $500. So I exercise and get $500 from contract. I would think that the $500 is applied to the amount I owe to buy the stock. So I also have to put up $2500 cash to complete the transaction.  So now I own the stock.  1 day later: XYZ Corp trading @ $11/share - I sell 500 shares that I bought at $6/share for $11.00/share = $6,600 Summary:I paid $1,250 + $3,000 = $4,250.00In the end after selling the stock I receive $6,600So I made a profit of $2,350 BTW, I’m not saying this would be the best way to do this, selling the contract might very well be a more profitable play. But I just want to know if I have the theory correct.  So these are the steps I see:1. Buy the contract paying the premium 2. Exercise my option early and buy the stock. 3. Sell the stock for more than what I paid for it. Do I understand this correctly?Thanks for listening.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 19:16:13'] Not sure if this is still live, but my post keeps getting flagged by the AutoMod. I bought Apple puts today ($150 strike) shortly after open when the stock was around $151. I paid $2.49. I am looking to maximize profit, as it only bought 6 contracts and I expect it to test the $144 level. Maybe even drop to $136 level. When does it make sense for me to sell and buy lower strike price outs to maximize profit?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 16:20:16'] For volatility skew, if you're thinking about buying or selling puts, should you buy or sell said puts when skew is heavily in favor of those puts (aka they're trading at a multiple many times that of their equivalent delta calls)?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-20 17:01:25'] All options data providers give you a massive amount of data. This is expensive and difficult to manage. I just need snapshots of historical prices – not the whole options chain, but rather an API to price an option given reported date, expiration date and strike price. Does anyone know of a service/API to dynamically request a specific historical options price (and greeks)?Maybe I am the only one, but I feel like this would be super useful because it would allow me dynamically request options prices as I run a backtest (as opposed to purchasing and managing all of the data myself).
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 07:56:57'] Probably a dumb question that I should know because I do a decent amount of options, but what is the downside of setting a really low strike point on selling a covered call as long as it is above my cost basis?For instance, I own 100 shares of carnival (CCL). My cost basis is $8.00. The current stock price is around $11.00. Beyond losing out on any further increase in stock, what is the downside of selling a covered call with a strike price of $9.00? The premiums I was looking at was around .35 or $350 for the entire contract.So I would lose the value of $2 per stock based on the price of the stock (Eleven (current value) minus Nine (the strike price) equals two), but get an extra $1.50 for each one based on the premium.Am I dumb for considering doing this? I would get $100 based from the rise in the value of the stock, and then an extra $325 for setting the strike below the current market rate. That sounds pretty good for an initial $800 investment.&#x200B;Edit: I meant $3.50 premium, not .35.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 16:43:50'] I have 2 396-405 SPY iron condors expiring tomorrow. Do I just let those expire if they stay in the range or do I need to sell off the spreads before they expire? Also, the premium I am getting is $37 per contract. Just so I am clear that is $37 per contract plus the $100 collateral so $274 in total, correct?
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 18:41:01'] So, here’s a question about the Greeks:I understand Delta is basically what the change in the option price will be after a $1 change in the underlying. I understand Gamma is the change in the Delta after a $1 change in the underlying. Is the Gamma of an option a constant? Or does it change? If it does change, is there a certain order that the values will change in?As in, a contract has a value of $1.00A Delta of .50A Gamma of .05The underlying goes up $1The value of the contract is now $1.50The Delta is now .55Is the Gamma still .05?If not, do all of the above calculations still take place before the new Gamma value is produced? I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around this as it seems like it’s constantly chasing changing values if the Gamma is also constantly changing.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 03:43:34'] Question about wash sale:If my coat basis is $21 and currently stock is $20, if I buy ITM put at $21 or above, I assume that won't trigger a wash?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 11:23:37'] I feel like I’m just now finally starting to grasp the Greeks but I want to run it by you to see whether my math is correct. According to the calculations shown in my screenshot, I should be -3 dollars today given all the variables I mention (Delta Theta, and vega specifically). I used the implied volatility change from yesterday to today from the underlying so I’m not sure if that applies when calculating the Vega changed between yesterday and today for the option. I don’t know where to find the chart for implied volatility for the option (instead of the underlying) in interactive broker. Here it is: [ford jun16/23 call](https://imgur.com/a/UwqXyAB)

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-23 07:28:47'] Why can't I just keep selling SPY covered call with 1dte that are somewhat OTM, how can I lose?  Probably super naive question, but let's say I have the capital to buy 100 shares of SPY. I then sell a call that is 1dte and around $7 OTM. Using today as an example, I would make a total of roughly $20 on the call I sold. Not impossible of course, but the chance of SPY going up by $7 in one day is pretty low. I understand that making $20 on something that cost me $40000 to enter is low, but overall if im bullish on the stock, then how can I lose?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 18:02:38'] Instead of phrasing this as a question, I am going to state my potentially incorrect assumption about how entering a synthetic covered call position (same expiration) and being assigned early will unfold.I sincerely appreciate any corrections/validations.My short call(s) have been exercised early, and the brokerage has automatically exercised my long call(s) to fulfill the assignment with the premium collected from the short call(s).Since the maximum P/L was clearly defined and the margin requirement was validated at the time of entering the position, I don’t have any additional obligations to purchase the underlying with cash to fulfill the assignment.The options that have been exercised within this combination no longer have value or promise to the underlying.Is this correct?I appreciate everyone’s time and support here.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-24 21:49:23'] If you're selling options, how do you calculate your position size? Do you use the margin requirement, the net liquidity, the value of the underlying?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-25 10:18:40'] I run mostly SPY credit spreads between 7-45DTE and had a few questions around assignment after quite a bit of digging and research through Reddit.1. “Assignment is likely with deep ITM options.” What exactly classified as “deep” it seems fairly subjective? How much does the remaining DTE play into how deep you can be before assignment happens?2. “Early assignment is likely when there is little to no extrinsic value left in the option”. Is there a remaining percentage of value where assignment is likely or is it when extrinsic value of the short option is at $0?3. Others have said a high delta signifies of an ITM option will be assigned. If so is there a ratio or percentage to work off to approximate?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-26 14:56:52'] Stupid question time about selling covered calls.I hope I have the qualification to comment.  I just discovered this sub and made my first ever reddit account a few days ago.I'm new to options and so far, the only trade I made was buying to open a single call option and then selling to close it before expiration just to get a feel for it.  So, if this question is profoundly stupid, I apologize in advance.Let's say that I want to write and sell a far dated covered call option.  Let's say the expiration is 6 months out but I guess it really doesn't matter whether it's far dated or not in the context of my question.  I have no margin at all on my account just as a FYI.  Would this be a "Sell to open covered" trade?  That's what shows up on my broker's platform.And let's say that after I write and sell a covered call option and I collect the premium on it.  Then as long as the covered call I sold and already collected the premium on is not ITM and is not assigned, is it then possible for me to sell the contract I hold at all or do I have to hold it until expiration or until assignment?If this is possible, then what Order Type would I choose?  On my platform, I have:"Buy to open""Sell to close""Sell to open covered""Buy to close covered"If this is not possible at all and is one of the most ridiculous questions ever asked in here, again, I'm sorry, but would still appreciate an answer.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-10 20:23:32'] Hmm...a couple things come to mind, purely speculative. Profit/Cost Basis ratio for those contracts are 1/100, with PoP >99.5%. So if they sell 277K contracts, it requires roughly $110M in buying power but nets them $1.1M in credit. The IV at the $20 strike is 356%, and Theta is over $100K *per day*....so, assuming you've got a couple billion to play with, this trade is actually pretty good. But it's pretty likely that I'm dead wrong.

POST_TEXT: b'Hey guys I made a what should I do about my TSLA ITM CC post a few days ago. I am still holding a 11/5 $970 CC that now expires in 2 trading days. My question is what is the probability this gets an early assignment? In other words what are chances my 100 shares of Tesla get sold at $970 BEFORE market close 11/5? Ive been told that deep ITM calls get assigned early but Ive held this CC for a 1.5 weeks deep ITM. If early assignments are rare it seems its smart to just roll out to another ITM CC slightly further out. This will give Tesla a chance to fall down to a spot where I can exit for cheap or just keep rolling it out till my strike is no longer ITM. Thoughts?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 19:36:39'] With something as volatile as TSLA, the chance of early assignment are almost zero. Early assignment on deep in the money calls usually only occurs on LEAPs and that particular strike hasn’t traded in forever being so deep ITM and it’s getting close to expiration and there’s no active market on the option at all now
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 19:34:17'] Deep ITM (1 delta) early exercise is a break even happening for the exerciser.So there is no reason to early exercise normally.So it's hard to know how.likely it is.It's only the dummies that will do it in normal situations.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 19:34:33'] I have a few ($775 and $870) that I keep rolling out a week, over and over, usually 3:30 EST on Fridays, never been assigned. Yes, also hoping for a pullback, but I’m losing hope for one. Premium still decent, despite being deep ITM.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-03 19:36:36'] Why don’t you buy it back? Then sell another one a few weeks down the road? Closer to $1300-1400 while it is high. You might lose a little bit now, but at least keep your 100 shares
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-04 01:29:45'] Do nothing. The shares will be assigned and you will have a fresh wad of cash. Move onto the next trade.Rolling the call would be a big mistake. The covered call is the simplest options strategy but ppl love to overcomplicate it by getting cute and rolling it. You are allowed to buy the shares again. Just wait for a dip.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-10 12:36:09'] Very rarely someone will exercise for no good reason and you'll get assigned.I sold a call and got early assignment near the dividend record date when it was still OTM.  I guess the buyer wanted the dividend.  However the strike minus dividend was greater than the share price, meaning it's cheaper to just buy shares to collect the dividend.  Plus the call still had \~.6-.7 value which could have been sold or even held onto in case it paid off even more.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 15:15:33'] I’m struggling to wrap my head around vertical spreads. Last week I entered an SPY bear call. I bought the 17Feb 407C for 5.28 and sold 17Feb 403C for 7.93. So I got $265 credit with max loss of $400. SPY closed at 408 Friday and my assumption is vertical movement.   I understand if both contacts expire OTM I keep the credit and ITM I have to close and spend $400. I am less clear about what happens if they expire somewhere in between (let’s say 405) and how I would close the contracts.    My main question, however is this: The 407C is trading for 5.83 and 403C for 8.52.  Assuming I can fill these positions, I can close these contracts for $269, four dollars more than what i paid. I could then slide the spread higher to sell the 408C and buy the 412C. To me this seems like a pretty obvious adjustment that puts me in a better position. Am I missing something? What would be the disadvantage of this adjustment? Thank you!

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-09 16:21:55'] I understand this conceptually and practically. I'm curious if anyone knows how this works at the level of the broker/clearinghouse. I'll explain my particular situation at the end.If I sell OPTION X to PERSON A, then a few weeks later, buy OPTION X to close at a profit, I'm not literally buying OPTION X back from PERSON A. I'm buying a new contract at a new price that PERSON B is writing for the same security.Does a computer just automatically change the database linking between me and PERSON A to PERSON B and PERSON A? Is that done at the brokerage level, or clearinghouse level, or at OCC, or somewhere else? Is it done immediately or when the option expires? Does anyone here really know how this actually works?I've always been curious, but now it's relevant for me. I sold some GOOG March 3 Puts $94 in Vanguard. I then initiated an ACATS from Vanguard to tastyworks. Both brokerages said I couldn't do anything with the option while they were in transit until Feb 15. Since Google has declined, I want to close the puts at a profit, not wait until Feb 15. Tastyworks said I could buy the same number of GOOG March 3 Puts $94 in their account, then once the ACATS completed, they would all disappear (since the -# of written puts transferring in would balance the # of puts in the account).On one level, that makes sense, but they hadn't seen it before, and I was wondering if anyone understood how it would technically transpire.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-10 04:41:34'] Hello, please help me understand this situation.    Let's say underlying is trading at $100 per share and I place a put credit spread with short leg at $95 and long leg at $90. If the stock moves against me and the share price is now trading at $89 per share,(there is still time before expiration). I can do 3 things:    a) close the trade at a loss    b) roll over to a different expiration date and preferably move down the strike prices of my legs.    c) open a call credit spread at the same expiration using the same collateral, basically an iron condor or iron Butterly.    Now here is my question, if I chose c) and I've already accepted that I'm losing the $500 collateral and I just want to minimize my loss, can I open the call spread at a lower strike price than my legs of the put spread? say open the call spread with short leg $80 and long leg at $85(credit will be $150), instead of 95/100 call spread (credit will be $50). I feel like I'm missing something here, just can't understand what.

Since the stock is already so close to $0 already you don't need to buy any protective long leg (lmao).

POST_TEXT: b"so I have 1120 shares of amazon at $159 a share and I'm thinking of selling calls and puts to slowly start making my money back, now I've sold covered calls in the past but in all honesty, I don't know what to honestly do."
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 11:00:09'] Covered calls at $159 to begin with and as you make some money back. eg. 1.00 from 1 contract you can lower the break even price to a CC for $158 and collect more in credit and keep doing it.  Keep experimenting with it and to ensure your profitble my hard rule is selling CC at break even price or above. Another tip, when VIX is higher Volatility increases and so price of options increases which is ideal for CC.  I would  sell CC at varying price and varying times which means I would not enter int 11 contracts in 1 trade.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 12:04:26'] when I've had similar situations,  what I've done is start a call ladder.   Sell 1 call, 6 weeks out,  and each week sell another, until you have 6 covered calls.  By only covering half, it gives you some income, but in the case of a sudden spike up,  you could avoid having shared called away by rolling 1 call for 2.  I've been doing this with SHOP
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 11:31:09'] For starters, selling anything close to your cost basis will yield only a penny or two so not worth it.   If you are up for a little risk, 30 days out and around 110-115 you can get $1 so 10 contracts will yield about a $1,000.  That’s actually helping some.    If for some reason it really starts to run you should be prepared to roll up and out or let the position go for a loss and maybe wheel it if you want to stay in the position long term with CSP’s.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 20:43:40'] You have $178,000 position in AMZN, and your asking for advice on Reddit? Just roll the dice man. Seems to have worked pretty well for you so far. Best bet is sell cc’s just a bit OTM.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:29:11'] I believe that AMZN is too far extended to the downside for this particular quarter. I would “rinse-cycle” them…. begin selling calls at strikes at least 1.5% above, weekly, then writing cash covered puts a strike or two below until filled. Yes this means you have to finally accept realized losses,   But at least from that point forward you’re increasing your balance. Don’t let FOMO stop you from making money. 💰
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:35:47'] If it were me,  I would hedge a percentage of the deltas (for me 25-35% if I were bullish and 50% if bearish).  So you have 1120 long deltas sell short dates 7-14DTE at .30 deltas,  then just roll them weekly.  If you see the stock rally add another call at the same strike until you are hedged to the tune of around 25-50% of shares.   You can buy them and sell them at your pleasure since you own the shares!  So for me it would be more about hedging all that long delta even if I was green in the trade I would still do this.  If I am red I do it more aggressively.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:50:09'] First and foremost, you need to decide if you are bullish or bearish on AMZN. Your past loss really doesn't matter. After you figure out your trade then decide which options are best.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 12:44:26'] Sell the 30 delta calls against some of your stock.  Maybe 1/4 to start.  remember, if your stock gets called away, you can always sell puts and keep going. If the stock gets called away, it's not game over.  it's just part of the game.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 13:51:36'] What is your net stock cost including any put or call premiums you’ve collected up until now?  Or, did you buy 1120 shares outright and paid $159 per share?  You’re saying you’ve sold CCs in the past, how much has this collected?Ideally you’ll want to sell CCs at a strike above your net stock cost in case the share price spikes up and they are called away.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 14:32:44'] Sell 30 deltas with the dates staggered so weekly to 90 dte. The whole selling above cost average is for the birds. Your job is to generate returns not hold on to your sunken cost bias.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 15:43:35'] I have a good amount of money in Amzn too. Not nearly as much as you though. I bought 22 shares at 143. I’m holding steady. If it drops below $95 I’ll buy some more shares. I’m really looking at QQQ to make a decision. It’s been flirting with 315. If it does and holds…it’s a good sign for tech stocks. If it drops back down to 300 then I see a recession coming. Feels like speculation is boosting the market up. I don’t know if it can work long term. Aka fake it til you make it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:11:51'] Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Meaning, don’t plop down 1000 shares and sell 100 covered calls with one expiration date at one strike. Start with one covered call (100 shares of stock) and learn as you go.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 16:50:27'] I will not hesitate to sell some consistently on a green day.  Selling cc cover at a lower price is risky.  For each contract itm you lose -$6K.  That is -$66K for 11 contracts.  If you paid way under 96 I would recommend cc for income. Even that is full of risk. I also read others comments but that sounds more risky.  Your current paper loss is a concern.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 17:22:28'] A covered put is short shares and a short put.  Is that what you mean?
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 20:48:56'] For selling puts, are you bullish in Amazon? Are you willing to capture more shares if you were assigned Amazon at worst case? If so, what price? You’re going to picking up pennies if you sell covered calls on Amazon. Sure you can sell cc at a strike lower than your cost basis but is it really worth the risk of getting them called away and lock in the loss? If you’re no longer bullish about Amazon and just wanted to get rid of the stocks, then sure. Sell CCs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 21:09:57'] I bought a few hundred shares about 2 weeks ago at ~$99.  Did 1 buy write expiring this coming Friday for $101 … received $280 for that.  I think the price will get close to that by this Friday.  I’ve been watching a lot of indicators …so check those out before entering a position.  I’m watching for a run up to write a 4/21 contract and roll my other contract.  Also check out call open interest to see what expectation is …and also watch the daily call volume …and remember Amzn earnings coming next month …might see a run up.  I use Barchart and the Barchart app. I bought Amzn pre split for $120 and sold for $150 last year and have been waiting since then to jump back in.  I sold CSPs 4/21 $90 a few months ago thinking I might get assigned to no avail so I just decided to buy the stock …but received some nice premium on the puts.  Maybe sell some puts when the stock takes a dip to receive some more premium and lower your CB.  Put call ratio for 4/21 is .48 and the trend is up. I agree with others to sell a call or 2 (after a run up…even if it’s only to $102) then wait and see.  Pay attention to a possible pre earnings run up.  I’d choose .25 delta or lower in case there’s a good run up and you have to chase the call.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 23:02:00'] I would not sell CCs on your shares, since the current price is so far below any reasonable strikes. If you sell CCs at say 110 or 115 and then the stock shoots up past that, you will regret having them called away. I think you should examine whether you believe amzn has good upside potential right now or you think you can utilize that capital more efficiently. If you think they are better opportunities, then sell and move on. If you think it can go back up to your cost basis, then hold. But selling any CCs below your cost basis has the chance of locking in a real loss
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-26 23:06:02'] Just reading your replies and not trying to be an ass, you need to dive a little deeper into options fundamentals and understand better which position your taking vs it’s outcome a little better before dicking around with a $100,000 position. I mean, even if Amazon is your only position you’ve got about a 6 figure portfolio so obviously some fucking around money available to you. Give an actual financial advisor a few bucks to talk you through this shit one on one and nail down your specific goals.Edit: $109905.60 Fuck what Reddit has to say brother, go seek professional advice.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 04:38:26'] With that amount of money you could try practicing 0dte iron condors on paper. Buy back the losing positions and let the winners ride upwards and sell them for premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 07:31:26'] With amzn, isn’t it just easier to sell SPX calls since it’s such a big part of market? And European style settlement is so easy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-27 09:23:42'] I agree with some comments. You'll first need to determine if your macro bias ..is bullish or bearish on Amzn & why U entered the trade (beside making $$). What's your time horizon for this trade? ( long or short term ). You scaled into Amzn w/avg price of $159 now, your bias feels slightly bullish or were you trying to avg lower hoping for bounce to exit @ breakeven? After U figured out your bias lean (bull or bear) and w/$100K + position in a single instrument do the homework (TA). This will determine how aggressive & directionality of your approach towards the options trade. Mistakes are inevitable, doing the analysis of instrument, group, sector will reduce but not eliminate chances of losses. Trading is about risk mgt and living to trade another day.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 07:32:46'] There have been a lot of posts about this lately, unfortunately the last one with a good discussion was deleted.Your friends long option was not exercised automatically as it was out of  the money based on the closing price.  Whether his short is exercised is up to whoever holds these contracts.  They have until 530pm et to notify their intent to override the automatic exercise/non exercise.  The OCC will then aggregate the results and notify the brokers sometime before midnight.  Unfortunately by the time your broker finds out the short is  assigned, it is to late to do anything about  exercising his long.This seemed to happen to a lot of people Friday, as TSLA made a big after hours move.  Normally RH may close out expiring positions before the close for the trader, but I am guessing since these were far out of the money, they didn't feel the need.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 10:40:40'] Read up on pin risk. It's one of the few exceptions to spreads being defined risk. The tl;dr is that on expiration day, if a stock closes right around the strike price of your short option (including AH trading), you won't know whether you've been assigned on your short option until Saturday. At that point, it's too late to exercise your long option. So you're now either long or short 100 shares of the underlying. If the stock gaps up or down Monday morning, you have to cover at whatever the new price is. If it's moved against you, you could take a big loss.Conversely, if you tell your broker on Friday to exercise your long option, you won't know whether you've been assigned on the short option until Saturday. If you weren't assigned on the short but you exercised the long, you're now either long or short 100 shares and have the same issue.https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/hdyddu/the_lesser_known_dangers_of_credit_spreads_i/

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 11:26:48'] Not a pro but trade full time and know the process well.He should never have left this to expire and it is posted many times each week to close all options before they expire . . .The broker did nothing wrong as it was the option buyer who has up until about 5:30pm ET to exercise.  The long leg was not ITM so the broker would not auto exercise so it would have been up to him to tell the broker to exercise it which he could have done up to 5:30pm ET as well.Oh wait, you can't reach RH to tell them to exercise!  I'm sure RH liquidated the stock and they would not care what price they got.Your "friend" made the mistake of letting the options expire so it is entirely their fault.  What your friend should learn is to not let any option expire unless you, um, he, is ready and willing to take the assignment of the stock.  Another thing is to get a real broker as I'm not 100% sure, but I believe TOS would have at least tried to contact me to tell me the short leg was being assigned and did I want to exercise my long leg to cover.  You just don't get that level of service from a crappy free broker . . .
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 18:20:54'] Not even remotely Robinhood’s fault.  First, auto-exercise is only based on regular trading closing price.  It is up the the friend to monitor AH trading and act accordingly (e.g., exercise the long puts).  Better yet:  close the positions (it goes without saying that you have to do this during regular trading hours but given what happened here, I’m just making sure).  Second, Robinhood doesn’t receive notice of the short puts being exercised right away (and assigned to the friend); rather, the OCC receives exercise instructions and then randomly selects a broker with a short contract holder, which may or not be the same broker from which the exercise instruction originated.  Then the selected broker selects, typically randomly, a contract holder for assignment...this is not an immediate process (the broker won’t even know until AH trading has closed) so there is nothing for the broker to react to.  Third, it only takes a sliver of forethought to figure out what pin risk is without even having to read about it.  On a volatile stock such as TSLA, your short can be pinned quite some distance out.  Fourth, and with respect, the actions taken by the friend here demonstrate nothing more than ignorance of the exercise and assignment process, as well as the risk of spreads and almost how options work in general.  It’s an expensive lesson but that takes me back to point three above:  Just thinking forward a little bit and asking questions about the position should have been enough here.  For example, what if the underlying does X, Y, or Z?  How does that affect the position?  Instead, the friend is surprised that the broker didn’t do this for him.  Lastly, the friend’s account not being a margin account does not insulate the friend from losses.  I wish the “friend” best of luck.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 07:32:23'] Robinhood is not on the hook here.His $402 was exercised by the holder. His $400 leg, held by him, was OTM, so he would have had to instruct them to exercise it. He didn't do that.If someone exercises an option, it is randomly assigned by the OCC. Did he read this [document](https://www.theocc.com/Company-Information/Documents-and-Archives/Options-Disclosure-Document) when it was sent to him that explains this in detail? "Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must read a copy of the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options, also known as the options disclosure document (ODD). It explains the characteristics and risks of exchange traded options. "Spreads actually \*increase\* risk. It's why you can't trade spreads until you are approved for a higher level.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 07:30:57'] This is hard to follow because you've mixed up your terms. You say he had a put debit spread but the spread you describe is a credit spread. And you're saying RH should have exercised the short leg, but you can't exercise a short leg. Confusing.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 19:08:09'] I work for a broker and it is standard to exercise contracts that expire in the money. However that is based on market closing price. If it becomes in the money in the after hours it is the duty of the client to perform a cashless exercise at that point

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 15:35:54'] Sorry that your friend went through the TSLA news event.This is the comment I made in the deleted TSLA thread. It has a screen shot of the closing option prices last Friday (4pm close). [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/imx5tn/clarification\_on\_assignmentexercising/g486dmi?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/imx5tn/clarification_on_assignmentexercising/g486dmi?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)Look closely at the out of the money options (calls and puts). They are all bid up. What does that mean? It means that the market **believes** there is news coming out that will move this stock before the 5:30pm option notice deadline. If I were short any TSLA options, I would not have gone away at 4:02pm and start the Labor Day weekend. I would have waited for news and acted accordingly.TLDR...  Although I am smart, I am not smarter than the market. On a normal expiration, out of the money options should have minimal bids (0.01 or 0.05 or 0.10 etc ) and not $1 bids or $2 bids. This is your tell. The market is telling you something. Respect the market.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 11:58:14'] Here is my take.  If you are trading in a self managed account you need to manage your account.  The markets move, early exercises happen and we need to be ready for it.  The best advice for going forward is to close positions prior to expiration, this reduces risk and ensures certainty.

POST_TEXT: b'I trade a bit, mainly stocks, but now and then on the Plus500 platform (hope its not an insult here ;) )\nYesterday I sold a few 585 put options which will expire in two weeks, since I dont believe TSLA will fall almost 15% in two weeks.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:38:27'] The correct answer is IV. I posted this answer a couple of days ago, but I think it applies to help you here: IV is created by bidders inflating the option beyond it's fair value. In an options pricing model like BSM or Stensland, the option has a fair value according to underlying's price, DTE, strike price, and the risk free interest rate (there are also differences in the calculation of early exercise, but don't focus on that). The remainder of the option's price then is IV. As an underlying's price moves in a direction or is anticipated to move in a direction, bidders suddenly appear at particular strikes, causing the price to move upward. Usually this correlates to an event like earnings, unexpected news, or in this case the underlying doubling... "IV Crush" then is experienced when the bidders suddenly disappear from that option, thereby causing the IV portion of the price to collapse, coming back closer to fair value. **IV is the reason then that an options price can seem to be non-sensical in such that a put can gain value when the underlying goes up, or a call gaining value when the price moves down, going against the normal pricing expectation.** Traders can capitalize on this IV inflation by actually selling the volatility in the option, and then as the IV disappears, they can buy back the option for a profit.    Hope that helps the understanding.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:54:05'] Honestly buddy... If you're asking these kinds of questions and you're selling premium... Boy.... You're stepping in above your head here.I would close the position you have and maybe play with going long very small positions in options to understand how they work. Then play with selling.. I'm telling you, you're playing with fire here.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:17:48'] Implied Volatility.  Since Tesla swings so hard, options prices usually lag behind.  If it stays where it is in a fairly flat manner now you will see the price of the put drop pretty heavily.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 14:04:59'] What was TSLA trading at when you sold the option? Did you set the price at the mid point or did you sell at market?TSLA closed lower today, puts go up when stocks go down, you said it went up? I'm showing a lower close on the day. IV.. maybe but unlikely. HOWEVER, TSLA has earnings in 3 weeks, so IV will go UP into earnings. Always double check earnings or other events(with Biotech think ASCO conference etc)..
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 15:51:49'] Wanted to piggyback on Op's question about the TSLA put option. Selling TSLA put at $400 strike on 7/9 put could collect $109 premium today. The chance for TSLA to fall 40% in 1.5 weeks looks very very slim. Why is the premium so high (comparing to any other SP500 stocks)?
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 12:17:44'] Implied volatility increased? Or bid ask spread is wide

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:38:53'] I am going to be a bit of a contrarian here:TSLA IV did not go through any kind of shift today that would allow one to say "this was due to IV." I doubt that TSLA IV changed at all today. Also a stock that deep in the money would not be much affected by IV even if it did shift. So IMO that is not the answer.I honestly think that you got your comparison wrong. TSLA was essentially even today and the call option was up around 3% to 4%.  But there is a nearly a $2 spread between bid and ask so the actual paper gain or loss is going to depend upon whatever you assume about the appropriate peg. The assumption that it can be calculated mid-price between bid and ask is not appropriate for an option that ditm.I regard this as a fairly risky bet. TSLA doesn't have to fall 15% for you to lose money - and if there is a negative tail event taking it more than 15%, you lose everything.Why didn't you consider a put credit spread - quite a bit safer than this? [edit: clear up the argument]
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-30 13:51:58'] You better be prepared to buy if you're assigned buddy. Because if you're not and stock tanks, and your p/l tanks in the red, the panic sets in and you're in world of pain.

POST_TEXT: b'Talk me out of this:  looking at TSLA, it has trades between $775 and $900 over the past month.  Im considering buying 100 shares and immediately selling a $900 covered call.  Premium on the 3/5/21 $900 C is $33.55/share.  Assuming purchase price of $845, Basis on the purchase is reduced to $811.45 and  potential max profit of $88.55/share.  If I did this, the strategy would be to hold until assignment OR buy the call back when it has reduced by half value and do it again based on the then-current value of the stock.  Is this a good idea?  Am I missing something in the risk analysis?  Is there a best target date (30 days, 45 days) and is there anything else that should be considered (Greeks) in identifying the theoretical ideal strike price and date for this strategy?'

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 12:39:53'] I’m a compulsive seller of TSLA options from 1 month. Your analysis is right, but I prefer to sell Vega on TSLA. Term structure has a non efficient peak in Jan22. I think is the best maturity to sell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 16:28:24'] This has been my goal for the past 4 months and I finally bought 100 tsla last thursday @ 816 a share with intent of selling weekly CC. I sold a 900$ one this week for $800'ish. Next week i'll do similar and the week after...and on...
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 18:10:24'] There is a guy who traded TSLA to buy a Tesla for his son. If it were me, I'd go wheel strategy and start by selling puts though. OTM at $830 Weeklies. And just stay OTM until you get exercised.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 13:32:44'] You are giving up potential upside. What happens if they roll out FSD to the whole fleet? Or launch their ride hailing app? The stock could jump. Tesla stock IS volatile.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 13:51:46'] My only comment would be to ask if you're open to selling shorter dated calls?  It looks like the weekly drop in value on the $900 strike is relatively linear, about $8 per week, over the next four weeks out to 3/5/21, so why not go with a 2/12/21 or 2/19/21 expiry instead?  Tesla climbing 5.9% in any given week seems highly probable (TSLA moving +4% in 5 days has been one standard deviation historically), and if it did climb that high by 2/12 or 2/19, then you would have the opportunity to sell your next call at a better strike price at that point in time?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 12:48:11'] I was thinking about this too. But instead of selling only calls each week, I would sell also shorts on the other side (reasonably OTM). It can only go either way.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 13:36:03']  You’re underestimating the risk of holding the 100 shares long. Lower you risk if bullish by buying the bull call spread using the $800 at roughly $84. This also ties up much less capital for trading. TSLA has moved in a $100 range in just the past 5 days. Someone’s been unloading. Caveat emptor.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 18:24:14'] if you bought shares 100 @ 850 =85,000  and sold a call for 3.5k , you have effective cost of 81.5k . As long as the stocks stays above 815 you are ok, but what if it goes further down ? You will have to buyback the 'sold' call for some premium(even though less) and then get rid of your shares at less price and then buy them again further down if you wish. This is the worst case scenario anyways, but could still happen with tesla in some weeks. One red day will move the stock $40 down...
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 18:35:38'] Personally, I would do a LEAPS on TSLA for March 2023 around $500 ITM (if you can afford it of course). That can be your driving bullish leg and you can sell CC on top of it. However, you have to make sure to stay on top of it for potentially rolling.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 18:46:51'] Tastytrade always recommends 45-60 days out, .30 delta. This is a good combo to get theta gains, and minimize probability ITM. If I were you, I would sell a longer dated CC at a higher strike. And then sell or roll at 25 or 50% profit, or however you want to manage it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-04 20:08:56'] Somewhat related question. I've been considering selling some TSLA stock to reduce risk to my portfolio, as it's currently a bit TSLA heavy. Is it a no brainer to sell covered calls weekly, slightly out of the money and just collect premiums and of I get exercised, so be it, since I was planning to exit my position anyway? Worth it? Or just sell the damn stock?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-05 00:41:00'] If you're insistent on buying shares, sell a put at a strike you'd like to pay for the actual shares and then either collect the premium and win or collect the premium, get assigned, and get the stock you want at the price you'd prefer.

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-08 06:14:26'] Different people may feel differently, but I NEVER roll options to anything that isn't cash-positive.  So if I sell a call and then the stock goes up and now the option is, say, $1000, I will never roll it to anything that doesn't give me $1000.I might be willing to pair it with a put spread or something so that the entire system is positive, but I will not spend money.  My theory is suppose I had sold an AAPL call at $125.  Then AAPL goes up to $135 and I pay $1000 to up my call.  Then AAPL goes back down to $125.  I've lost my $1000.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-12 11:51:53'] As soon as Elon tweets or SEC filings confirm he's done selling, you know TSLA is probably going to pop. The rate he's going, he could finish early next week. If you plan on exercising that is a steep strike price I wouldn't want to be in for 100 shares. However, if you are making money off the premium, anything can happen. It's interesting the support TSLA has had and hasn't been pushed down more while he's selling. I have a $1300 call expiring next Friday. I'm not out yet because of the support. I do have a stop loss, so hoping it doesn't get that low.

I know that if I hold the spread through expiration I will collect the premium but most people recommend closing the spread to avoid after-hours price movement cause you to owe massive amounts.My question is regarding the amount of money I can receive if you look at the image I linked it says Today's return is $40 Total return is currently at $32.Does that mean if i sell to close this spread now that I will just collect only that $32 or is that in addition to the premium Credit I received when opening the trade?Any help with this would be great!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:01:42'] I was reading the WSJ today about the option volume on TSLA. 3M contracts is 300M shares which is about ten percent of the float. Then I pondered what if a stock's shares became massively over subscribed by calls?What happens if everyone decides to exercise and there aren't enough shares to go around? Is there a such thing as an "options squeeze"? Has such an event ever occured? (Akin to the Hunt Brother's cornering silver or Soros tanking the pound.)This seems unlikely but it is interesting to consider. I would guess that puts would offset calls to a large extent. I would guess that there would have to be an extraordinary proportion of naked call sellers to end up oversubscribed.I'd be glad to read up on this if you can help me with some references. I'm an options n00b.Also, this post was autoremoved presumably because I lack karma. I'm also a reddit n00b. How do I avoid this?

Trying to figure out what the borrowing costs are now that I'm short these shares. Do brokerages typically treat it differently than if I had set up the trade as a short of the shares? It is unfortunate if I would be charged the same borrowing costs as if I had just tried to borrow/short the shares outright. The bank would charge me 59% interest if I were to borrow more shares, but is unclear about what the rate charged on the shares that I'm currently short.

I am confused on how protection works with spreads. This also relates to someone getting assigned on the sell side of their spread in the after hours and in letting the long side of the spread expire without exercising, they end up having to pay a lot of money to buy 100 shares worth of a stock that they got assigned on.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 22:19:38'] Hi everyone, this might be a bit long, just sharing my option trading experience for the past 7 months and would like some advice/insight/opinion and probably what would you do if you were me:I learned the Wheel from here and I gave it a try back in July last year, where I found a stock trading @ around $26 that time and did a 1 Short Put contract next month @ 25 for $1.25, if I was right I remember it was a 5% return for premium if I didn't get assigned. Anyway the stock market never works the way I think it would, and I got assigned @ $25 and have been holding the shares until now.I started working the Wheel, kept doing Short Calls every month, the worst moment was the stock was down to $14, but my Short Call was doing alright, even when it reached $14 I am still like breakeven in the case if I sell all my shares @ $14. Sometimes I am forced to roll up because I am too close to the strike price, but nothing serious so far so good.Until the end of December, the stock market started to rebound, at that time the stock price was around $21, and was seeing a lot of big green days. I also learned this from Reddit, the best time to do Short Call is during the big green day, and I been seeing a lot 5% 10% rebound in a day for this stock, so I tried to be safe, did 35 contracts of Short Call @ $28 expires 30th January for like pennies, hoping there is no way to rebound 33% by end of January.Again the stock market never works the way I think it would, this month I didn't have much sleep lol, the only good night sleep I can have is during the weekend where the market won't open in the next morning. I watched it climb step by step every 3 days, $22, $24, and then to my Short Put assigned price $25, last week was $26, then last Friday was $27.5 geez. And the price for today is $28.3 lol. Still got 2 more trading days left before expiration, but I couldn't watch it anymore, and I can't guarantee the stock will close below $28 next Monday, so I closed all my Short Call contracts and am now lining up for next month February with lesser contracts Short Calls. With my Short Call winnings for the past 7 months, and with the shares I already have from $25, I don't really need to do a lot of Short Call contracts for February to make up the loss.Since I only got assigned for 1 contract @ $25 seven months ago, when I did 35 contracts Short Call I was using a margin account. I never really done that many before, and I learned that I need some sort of security deposit in the account to allow me to do so. And during mid January, when it was very volatile, the trading system helped me close positions automatically due to lack of funds in the account. Sometimes I can react in time and make deposits to avoid closing automatically (back then I still believed there was no way it's gonna reach $28). And those deposits weren't cheap, in total I had to chip in another 130K into the account just to stop it from closing more of the contracts.The question and advice I am asking here is what would you have done if you were me?1. Why I did 35 contracts for pennies back then was I was trying to make back some loss from other trades I done before.2. I did thought of rolling up during mid January, but back then the option prices were way too high, not realistic at all, so I waited till the last week of this month, hoping the time value goes down, and when I close the positions today, it was at least 100% cheaper if I close during mid January (and back then it was just $25, still thinking no way it will reach $28)3. Another dumb thing I should have used my 130k funds better was to invest in other stocks instead of working on this Wheel and miss out opportunities.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 02:49:18'] 1 ）Is the leverage effect of options gets higher    ,  when  higher  the  price above the buy price  ?I bought an ETH call option when ETH is at around 1558usd. When ETH price was up 7%, my option showed an unrealised profit of about 21%  (about 3x) ;  When ETH was up 3%, my option was showing a  profit of about 5% (about 2 x)And when I bought this option, it showed on Exchange(Binance ) the leverage of this option is  8X. So the price of ETH has to go up high enough to have 8X leverage, and if it doesn't go up much, then there's very little leverage, right?&#x200B;2） I don't know when to close my position . Because I find with the time goes by , my options price is getting down ,because i am paying time value.  When I had a 20% gain on my options, I didn't want to close the position because I thought it could go up in the future. But I'm paying time value, potentially offsetting the profit from the rising ETH price. How do I determine the timing to close my position?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 06:23:57'] I’ve done options for a while, but when Tesla tanked for no (ok, Elon reasons) reason I bought a lot of calls for June, thinking I’d make bank by March. Well, I’m making bank now based on pre market. I’m almost double my initial investment. I’ve never made this kind of money on options. It’s truly life altering.Do I sell all and lock gains? Do I sell half and play with house money until June? Please help.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-26 21:11:28'] I don't have anyone around who knows anything about stocks and options, so I'm hoping that strangers on the internet can help me. So, without further ado:Ford is currently trading at $12.85 as of this post.A $12.50 put for 02/03 sells for 26¢ per share. A $13 call for 02/03 sells for 40¢ per share. We'll assume for the sake of conversation that F doesn't crash. If I sell a put, and it doesn't get exercised, I keep the full $1250 ($12.50 per share, 100 shares), $26 of which is pure profit. If it does get exercised, I now have one call that I can mark out as a $13 call, sell it for the next week, and if it executes, I get the $1250, which is already $25 more than I paid, plus the $40 up front. If my call doesn't get exercised, I keep both the money, and my stock.If I can't find a buyer at a higher breakeven than I paid, I can sell my call at $3 two years from now, pocket $970 up front, and still call it a victory, since the $3 call means I'm out at most $300 per contract. Which is a lot, but still only 1/4 what I paid, and more than enough to start over with another company.So, if I'm understanding all this right, the only risk I take is "oh, I wound up bagholding like 25% of my investment, but the other 75% is still cash profit (assuming I've moved enough F to cover my initial puts and am now back in the black from selling in in the first place). That risk is mitigated, but not entirely eliminated, by due diligence.It seems like as long as the breakeven on the call you sold is higher than your average paid from selling the put that got you the call, the only risk is tanking stock. Profits might not be massive, but they're consistent, and an exit strategy (if F drops below $10 I get out) can (mostly) protect me from a tank. Please, somebody tell me where I'm wrong in all this, because everyone I know is telling me I'm wrong, but nobody, myself included, can find the flaw. I know there's a whole world of nuance where gigantic amounts of money can be made and lost in a heartbeat, but I don't want gigantic amounts of money, I want to stop being homeless.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 06:32:46'] I've got 2 cases I'm not sure what, if anything, to do about. I'm fairly new to options, so I'm sticking with cheap calls and covered calls with low cost while learning the cycles and greeks and all. Also I'm on a cash, not a margin, account, and not messing with puts yet.For one, I own 500 shares, and sold 5 OTM covered calls at a price I didn't think it would hit, but that I'd be ok to assign at. They've announced a reverse stock split, that I'm pretty sure will bring my 500 shares down to 100 (or maybe even less, don't know yet). Does anyone know what happens to my cc's if the number of shares is cut before they expire? The second one, last year I had bought a couple OTM calls that grew ITM then hovered. They've announced a large new issuance at about 3/4 of it's current share price, making my calls useless. I guess my question is similar to above - do any adjustments get made for options, or is this value change just part of the risk? I'm thinking adjustments have to happen if the change affects my number of shares, but not if it just affect the value of shares. Thanks for any insights you can share on this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 11:16:23'] Can someone help me understand this? Let's say I bought a call option on stock $ABC for $300. The strike price of the contract is $90, and the stock is currently trading for $95. Is it reasonable for me to assume that the value of the contract itself must be $300 + \[$(95 - 90) \* 100\] - $(Value of Decay)? As in, the price of the contract must be worth however much I bought it for, minus how much time has passed, plus the value that I would receive if I exercised the contract? If that's not the case, and the contract is still just worth $(300 - Decay), then shouldn't I exercise the contract and then sell the shares for profit? I'd be making $(200 - Decay) profit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 12:49:21'] How screwed am I?I already own 400 shares of company X. (BEP 30) They are currently trading at 21.6.I wrote 32 cash covered puts for May, SP 20. And I wrote 36 calls for May, SP 25.My reasoning for doing so was: collect premium on both sides. Lowering BEP to 20 when they drop below 20 and selling for 5 bucks extra a piece when they go beyond 25.But of course, the stock has to drop below 20 first..Now I potentially risk having to sell 3600 shares (I only hold 400) of a stock when they break 25. Currently, they're heading upwards.My best outcome would be dropping below, exercising, and then rising again. But this doesn't seem likely. Second best outcome would be a flat market until May and buying those 32 calls back at a lower premium: let theta eat away at it.But if it suddenly soars, I'm screwed, right? Any other thoughts?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-27 13:51:08'] I did a call spread 155/176.67 and now want to get out of it but don't know how.I bought 17 MAR 23 TSLA call 155 strike paid 6.55. I sold a same dated 176.67 call against it for 4.35. The are both IM right now with this monster move. I wanted to close out the trade but the current price difference of the options doesn't reflect the price difference between the underlying with the strikes (surprise yes I'm new to this).

I would have made more if I held on but that would have been on prayers and not on all the analysis I did which included Theta he explained.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-28 18:29:40'] Hello, why would my in-the-money option that I sold not be exercised?I sold an option contract which was very much in the money (by about 50%) but the expiration date came and went, and this morning I found that the option I sold was not there yet (since it expired), yet my shares were not taken and by account is up an extra few K. Why would this happen, my guess is the holder of the option did not have enough money to exercise the option, but that is pretty mind boggling to me. If you can't afford the option, then you can probably just sell it before deadline. Has anyone else experienced this before?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 10:05:31'] Looking to dip my toe into this stuff, I should have permissions enabled from tomorrow.From what I understand... I want to sell a Put on something I would quite like to buy anyway. So I'm thinking this:Sell 1 contract of https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VFC230317P00027500?p=VFC230317P00027500 which should give me $0.95 in premium, and I might end up being assigned 100 shares of VFC at $27.50.There's "no" downside in this for me - I either end up with 100 shares of VFC at a lower price than it's currently trading at, or I don't; and either way I get $95. Obviously I understand that the share could shoot up, oh well no big deal, or it could crash down, oh well no big deal.Then precisely because I'm not that attached to these shares, if I get assigned I can just write a covered call to make more premium from them.So - does this particular option have 'enough' volume? Am I missing something big? I mostly want to do this to buy non-EU packaged stuff, but want to get my head round everything (at least to a degree) first.Thanks.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-29 10:14:09'] Just looking for some advice on this investment.I bought 200 shares of CCL Carnival Cruise back on Nov 17 @ 9.75 a share.   My total cost is $1950 .   I bought these right after a price rejection around the 11 dollar area.  The stock came down I got in , and have been selling covered calls, and buying them back . $798 from premiums in sells, $477 I paid in buying back , so my total cost now for my 200 shares I own is $1629  , and cost per share is now $8.15My problem is , the current calls I had sold back in end of December are a 8.5 strike price Expiry is Feb 3  2023 ( this friday coming up)  .   The stock right now is at 11 dollars area.I dont really want to lose the shares, but things to consider are... If you look at a chart this stock has hit strong resistance every month last year July, Aug, Sept.. Oct, Nov .. it gets up to around 11 ish and then drops..My one choice is to just let my shares be taken at 8.50 strike  I make profit anyway because I got my cost basis down to $8.15 ,Or I can relax and wait until Friday gets near and see if this stock drops from 11 ish resistance again.. if so buying back the calls will be cheaper if it drops alot, or I can  roll the calls Friday at a higher strike price  a month or two out depending on where the stock price currently is.I guess I can let the shares be taken away if Friday comes and the stock is still high because Im not paying 2.58 per call to buy them back. .thats 500 dollars Im giving back. No way.&#x200B;Opinions, advice? Thank you.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-23 12:15:46'] Newish options trader here, ive been paper trading for about 6 months with consistent gains. I created a throw away here, so I can talk about my assets and portfolio and my strategy for feedback. Im primarily a real estate investor with 30 units owned outright and about 2 million in equity. My cashflow is around 10K a month to play with. I still work a full-time W2 position making 155K per anum. So this 10K a month of REI cashflow I can leverage without any real regard for safety into more capital, hence why im doing options, I dont rely on the money outside of investment.I picked up a scanner a while back for a few hundred bucks, and run my own through finviz. Generally ive been trading things like spy, qqq, nvda, msft, tsla etc... looking for volatility. Ive been waiting for open, wait for volatility to subside somewhat and find a clear direction. Ive been using MACD, RSI and MA 200 as far as technical indicators. At the start of the move I think its going to make ive been just buying calls or puts trying to keep it simple. I understand the more complicated options strategies and tried them, but honestly I have had way more success in my paper account with calls/puts maybe 3rd on up or down on the options chain in the intended direction.I keep resetting the account, but I have been starting with 25K, and pushing that to 200K before I reset the balance. Ive done this enough times now I feel comfortable putting my cash in, and going at it. When the trade starts going against me i cut my losses immediately, if its moving fast I do a market order, if its a slow mover i try and get filled with a limit order. So ill take a bunch of small losses, before I hit a big move either up or down with a call or put, and then I close it out around 3/4 of where I think it will hit. Ive only been trading between 930-1030 but generally im done around 10 and restart the next day. I tried trading outside this window and it does not work out. Most of the options Im trading are between 0dte and 1 week dte.Im fine with the risk reward, luck aspects of this strategy because I am able to lose the cash without any negative consequences, and it can help me drum up more capital for real estate investments that will cashflow. I think once I get the account to 200, I will scoop it into my business account, and then start fresh with 25K and keep doing that.I do not like option selling or credit spreads, or longer dated options because to me it feels like all of that is subject to way more manipulation by the market makers, then just scalping 0dte options. I tried them on paper, kept spreadsheets and it just seemed like a slower way to lose money tbh. With day trading calls and puts its a way more binary win lose, and ive been able to win more than lose so far. My experience with leaps, wheel strat and some of the others has led me to the conclusion that the reward is not worth the amount of risk with them. If im going to assume risk, I want the full reward.Looking for feedback on the strategy, but im essentially just day trading normal options.

POST_TEXT: b'Somewhat \\*educational\\* post using TSLA, on directional spreads vs OTM outright options.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-12 15:35:31'] Thanks for putting this up. I once tried to make a similar calculation integrating the profit over probability distribution to see which options were most profitable which I could share, but this seems truer to reality. Anecdotally, it's way easier to profit by selling options far OTM or buying options close to the money or even ITM.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-12 16:48:00'] Keep in mind a your profit and lost is at expiration. A lot of people who buy OTM options aren’t going to hold until expiration. They are looking to scalp it. They hit a certain profit amount and they’ll exit. Spreads are great but they are much slower to profit. If tesla is at 830 and goes to 875 tomorrow the Otm option is going to have a far higher profit then the spread.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-13 05:07:18'] Very cool analysis. You wouldn't ever catch me buying solitary calls or puts in an underlying and generally I don't prefer debit spreads either. A much more interesting play would be putting on a butterfly on Tesla. If you keep the expiration short you profit quickly for low risk and can structure the trade to make money at or even below the underlying price. If you take profits at 15% to 20% very easy to get in and out of a liquid stock like Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2020-05-12 19:47:12'] Wait, I'm confused. If you buy an 830 call and it hits the target of 1000, the intrinsic value of the option at expiry is $17,000. Your profit will likely be much higher than this if it hits 1000 with theta left over. So why is the 830 call gain only $6697?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 19:52:17'] small loss is when you get out in the beginning, nothing to me makes sense to keep chasing a bigger and bigger loss.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 19:40:06'] I will say you will need to tie up capital , and keep building up the capital requirements for a long time if you have to keep rolling  , and pray it pulls up to break even on the trade! This is when a good trader will know to just cut losses or keep throwing money at the problem, which can help sometimes!

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 20:07:47'] If it goes down far enough fast enough, and you keep rolling, it can reach the point where there is no longer room to roll down for a credit.  And if that happens, you won't be able to keep it OTM, and if it's deep ITM, you risk early assignment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 09:58:18'] Other replies have addressed the mechanical reasons why infinite rolling will eventually hit a wall. I'd like to address the mindset problem.Being an average, humble trader that just wants a decent trade "once and a while," doesn't require optimizing the hell out of every trade. But "doesn't require" isn't the same thing as "blindly ignore," let alone "intentionally make bad decisions."  Focusing on the outcome of a single trade is a very bad habit for any trader. It can lead to [results-oriented thinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/qfq82a/poker_wisdom_for_option_traders_the_evils_of/) as well as [loss aversion bias](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/content/loss-aversion-bias) and chasing profits at any cost.So my problem with the idea of rolling that one trade until it finally wins is that it misses the forest for the trees. A better mindset is to be indifferent to the outcome of a single trade and focus more on your average results over many trades. Over 100 would be good. Over 1000 would be better. Over 10,000 would be great. Averages are what matter. Averages are how you converge on the expected value you planned for and targeted. Averages are what separate profitable traders from one-hit wonders.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 00:37:34'] I’ll roll forever. I never take on a position that would result in a 2.5% loss if assigned and price goes to 0 or doubles. So if I have to roll out for credit, whatever. Time will catch up to it and I’ll roll again if I have to for even more credit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 14:44:01'] I think it's important to note that rolling indefinitely doesn't really exist. Can we roll for a long time, absolutely. But it's important to understand the math behind each roll: [https://youtu.be/YwF5YXKijDo](https://youtu.be/YwF5YXKijDo)In short, each time we roll, (assuming we're closing at a loss and re-opening a trade), we slowly erode our account value, even if we're receiving a credit. So our net liq decreases even as our cash and sweep increases.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-09 22:26:23'] You should only do this if you are happy with a large TSLA delta position during the coming months (and if you have deep pockets). Be sure to roll down and out (in time) when volatility pops.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 00:19:48'] I'd rather take the L and live to trade another day.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 07:10:27'] If the underlying keeps moving lower, there is a level where rolling doesn’t help much. There are many recent examples. Someone that sold puts on something like PLTR when it was 30 may have been able to roll for credit when it declined to 20. However when the decline continued to 7 it would have been hard to impossible to stay at a credit. There is also tying up capital both money and mental energy. Gap moves can be especially difficult situations.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 00:32:01'] Just stick to your plan. Because at the end of the day it is your money and you will regret it if you lose or miss the big win.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 05:08:43'] Dude, I'm rolling a $47 LCID put. Yes, it ties up capital. If you can afford it, who cares, roll and get premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 05:12:28'] Sometimes it is more efficient to take the static deltas of the shares as you fully participate in the moves up... but you risk you take the 100 deltas down, if the stock drops further. It is always about what makes sense. For instance, if I sold a put for 0.90$ and to roll 30-60 days out I can't get more than 0.2, then I would rather let myself be assigned (if I like the price) or take the loss.There is also the variant of taking the loss partially by rolling down and in, effectively buying some of the intrinsic with the premium.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 06:29:01'] This is how I "roll" (pun intended) - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/lliy8x/rolling\_short\_puts\_to\_avoid\_assignment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Optionswheel/comments/lliy8x/rolling_short_puts_to_avoid_assignment/)I'll add two things.  Keep in mind that provided the stock is above the strike price the trade will start to profit at some point.  There should be no rush to roll if the option is not ATM or ITM.  With TSLA around $172 your Apr 150 put is not at risk right now.  You don't include the credit you got, but calculating the breakeven price including that credit will find the BEP somewhere around $145.  The other thing is that rolling can be very helpful but can also move the trade out in time to keep it open longer that can reduce the profit per day.  I prefer trades that do not get challenged and just close for a 50% profit, so I like to get out of these problem trades as soon as possible and not let them hang around too long.  You opened this trade around the 45 dte so it might not profit until opened for 10 or more days.  Be patient and it is possible to mess up what would be a good profitable trade by adjusting too soon rather than let it work . . .
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 07:12:02'] You didn't state your objectives but I would usually take the assignment and sell the call in preference to rolling the put.   Sell the call at a strike reflective of how much you want to hold TSLA.   50 deltas to dump it, 30 deltas if you like it, and 10 deltas if you love it.NOTE: If you get really hammered you might not be selling anything.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 10:42:23'] I do this strategy as a side hustle, except OTM for 6 months out or more, and I go opposite the overall sentiment (sentiment is bearish, so I’m doing calls on certain securities). I haven’t been doing it long enough to tell for sure if it’s profitable, but if it works, I’ll post it here. I imagine that it’s emotions and fomo that keeps people who don’t do this from doing this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 11:37:57'] "Infinite" rolling might be ok with ETF options like spy, qqq and iwm (if you suffer from loss aversion like me), but if stocks are considered, take the loss and go on. Some stocks might be trash forever and it might get worse and you might get eg 0,05$ premium for a leap (made the experience at my first days)For stock options, I close the position at +100% option value.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-10 15:34:07'] TSLA has been hit hard the last few weeks and is down to 173.44 at close today. That's 23.44 above your strike price. You are far from being in the money. You didn't sell for what the contract is worth now, but you are still likely to profit if you wait until April. I would sit on it until around 5/1 unless you think it is likely TSLA drops another 15% by then.I have a 185 4/21 put that I am comfortable with. I've had it open and rolled it since 10/19, and I'm at $23 in credit. Furthermore, I'll add that I like the company and wouldn't mind taking the shares.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-12 09:05:24'] Far out of the money won’t matter. Puts and calls that are near the money can move the stock price in that market makers will hedge their position by buying or selling stock, e.g. currently at $1085, as it approaches $1100 strike and there is a lot of open interest, market makers will buy stock so they are covered if SP keeps going up. Lots of open interest can lead to lots of MM buying, which can further increase the share price, known as a gamma squeeze. I tend to find that max pain helps me feel comfortable choosing strikes when writing options, but it’s not dependable and doesn’t work well for a volatile stock like Tesla.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 10:23:29'] No, theta decay is what makes CSPs profit and this decay ramps up around 45 days, so selling CSPs about that far out and then doing so over and over will collect a substantial amount more premium.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-18 06:20:15'] if you're selling puts as a strategy you have to either expect assignment at some point, or have a clear exit strategy at a loss prior to assignment. those losses can be dramatic, to the extent you may have to accept assignment instead. when you sell puts, and stock price approaches your strike by dropping, the puts will become extremely expensive for others and yourself to buy, which is what you'd need to do to exit the trade. naked puts can have substantial risk. i also suggest you research the margin requirements for your strategy.        what strike price & expiration? how much premium are you going to get? if you get assigned do you have 100 x strike price x num. of contracts in your account (e.g. strike price of 1000 = 100K to cover purchase). then you're going to do this again, do you have the 100's of K's such a strat requires?  you'll be holding shares as well, and if those are dropping your account net liquidity will be utterly tanking. don't get me wrong, tsla can break 1200 again and roar towards 1500. in that case your puts could expire, you keep premium and continue with higher strikes. but you gotta consider first: what can go wrong with this, and what risk am i exposing to?  if you can't make money just swing trading TSLA shares, and especially if have no idea what i'm talking about above, then i'd say paying your student loans back might end up the least of your problems if you continue.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-18 10:18:45'] Depends on your available capital but any movement outside of your expectations can blow up your portfolio. If you plan to sell puts without leverage, you need to have the cash to buy the stock should the option be in the money. That's 100 grand of cash collateral for a put at 1000.If you use margin, things can get dicey very quickly with how volatile the stock is. Perhaps you should wait until you experience losses and see how you deal with it before jumping into the hedge fund money maker stock.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 15:13:28'] What do you mean by what could go wrong? Straddles are priced based on implied volatility. This strategy wins when you have outsized moves, and loses when you have undersized moves. You lose every day that your ITM leg isn’t far enough ITM to cover the premium you pay for the straddle. By employing this strategy, you’re basically betting that ES straddles are continually underpriced daily.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-21 15:10:28'] I checked something similar on spx. On a regular day, an atm straddle (or close if closing price isn’t exactly at the strikes) is priced around $3000 previous night. Its way more on event days like fomc - sometimes even double. Its around $5600 today. Said differently - MMs are typically pricing in a 30 point move. This strategy can make money if the move is greater than that. Sadly on the first few days I tried, market decided to have slow days (less than +/- 30). Expensive strategy. You’ll need a big balance and be prepared for several consecutive day of losses. On the contrary - huge pay days on momentum days with 1.5-2% moves. Best!

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 04:27:57'] Remember ES has 90% odds of breaking the overnight high or low during rth, so 0dte straddles have very high odds of paying if you get later in the day without a break of the range.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-22 06:07:14'] I wrote some code to track this type of thing but it’s for selling the straddle instead of buying it. If you were to sell, make sure you’re getting at least $54.77 in premium at day open for the 0 DTE. I’d have to think through the logic of the other way around. I’m not positive it’s as simple as making sure you pay less than $54.77 but it could be?

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 16:01:47'] This was a tough one.  If someone wanted to close their positions before the close they really would have had to pay up.  The puts 8 points out of the money were 3 bid on the close.   Not sure if this affected RH decision not to close out positions or not.    If they had, the comments here would have been RH bought back my $5 put spread that was way out of the money for $4!   These high premiums probably caused people to open positions not realizing the risk.Sorry for all the people who lost money here.  Tough way to learn a lesson.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-09 21:52:37'] I agreed.I rarely held my options until expiration.  I closed them at 0.01 or rolled them to the following week,.The tail risk at the end expiration day is not worth the extra pennies of profits.

I'm not saying you're wrong or that there isn't money to be made, but it seems like you're making a large jump.Good luck no matter what you do.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 14:20:06'] No no, do it. (This is not a golfing advice)
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 17:45:26'] You might consider using spreads to reduce your cash layout.E.g. you like to layout around $3k, you can put $3k at risk on selling put spreads. I think right now $605-600 is paying around $0.21, so you could do six of them and perhaps make around $125 on your $3k. In a week, not a month. Next week you can adjust your strikes and fire again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 19:27:03'] You can sell put credit spreads instead to make that money with a lot less margin.The 30 day 560/550 spread is going for 1.30 or so. Sell 8 of those for a total of $1040, margin requirement is $6,960. These will expire worthless with TSLA over 560.If you think $100 up is also unlikely, you can make it an iron condor by also selling the 780/790 call spread for 1.60. Combine both spreads for a 2.90 credit, then you only need to sell 4 of these for a total of $1,160, with only a $2,840 margin requirement.Now you make all of that if TSLA is anywhere between 560 and 780.Not how I'd trade it though.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 16:37:48'] Tesla can have 40+ point swings each day without news. Dropping 100 is just 2 red days. And it can do much worse if actual negative news happens.There's no reality to it's valuation as the world's largest car company in spite of every non-ev car company selling more carsThe entire ev sector is down right now.You're putting 50k in the hands of Elon musk's Twitter profile.There are easier ways to make that much money without betting on this stock for instance you can sell 100 AAPL 90/80 bear put spreads expiring next month for 100k margin held to gain 1000 and nobody believes AAPL had a chance of dropping that low short of the whole market crashing and even then it's unlikely AAPL is making enough money to justify their valuation.

There's no real reason why Tesla should trade over any other automotive stock. They sell less cars than many of the other manufacturers and have shit fundamentals. It's a hyped stock that's managed to stay hyped for a long time. If you want to see what happens when the market gets bored with a stock, look at Ford.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-04 15:30:49'] You could make more selling roblox puts and if you’re assigned you’d be buying below ipo price. Tesla has tripled in the past year and if it even goes halfway back to that price you lose big.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-23 10:46:05'] That seems very safe, but $420 also sounded absurdly high (no pun intended) just a few months back. There is a $7k blue sky scenario price target out there for TSLA, so however unlikely to jump over $2k it’s certainly possible.

I was looking at some march expiry calls to sell at around 1,500 strike but didn't get the courage to go through with it. I keep thinking that investors in this stock could easily abandon rationality and drive it up to $3K in a short period of time. This stock seems to also rally when the rest of the market drops because there's short covering when the rest of the portfolio's long holdings are falling. I also worry about how there's unlimited loss with short calls. Also, I notice that when vol rises, call prices sometimes rise despite a drop in the underlying.

POST_TEXT: b'I was surprised to see the implied volatility of $TSLA decay this week. It closed at around a 47 IV Rank on Friday. Then Monday 12/14 it closed in the mid 30s.

The inclusion happens 12/21 and it is widely speculated among traders that funds will buy shares by close on 12/18. We are talking about a big move in either direction, so how can volatility contract leading into it? This has be a bummer both from a selling and a buying side.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 07:11:45'] I think there is a growing consensus of a major sell-off on Monday. A lot of traders and speculators bought in around the shorts launch and the meeting of the sp500 criteria. You know the old, buy the rumour/sell the news? This is the news. Anyone who bought the rumour and doesn't care about Tesla long term will probably be selling because for them, the hype about inclusion is over and the music has stopped. If I were playing Tesla (other than being long shares and not selling until Im a boomer and need divys), I would probably continue shorting condors and hoping to win off the crush. I have been suggesting 300/900 for the wings but I have no position myself.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 07:46:15'] Well, volatility is going to slowly fade if nothing changes. Think of IV as a pot of water, nothing new is stirring it up. Sure you just did a few good spins and it’s ripping, but after a few seconds (or whatever) it loses momentum. But, if something does stir it, volatility will pick up again (and fast). What makes IV great is that when IV spikes, it expands almost consistently since wild swings both ways help. Going long theta and long delta is the best long term move for TSLA, while shorting volatility. Because of this, call debit spreads or put credit spreads are probably the preferred TSLA strat.

Lol3. What strucks me a bit of the contraction of Implied Volatility just before the event is that it signals "complacency" to me. If we had a big risk of a big drop the price of Puts would be through the rough, but it's not. Neither is the price of calls anymore. They were last week. So this contraction is not pricing in a direction, but rather looks like people are like "no idea what's gonna happen bro," or assuming a somewhat steady price. Or else volatility would be much higher.4. I hold $TSLA call spreads but I was waiting to sell premium this week and I am frustrated because volatility piked last week and has dropped by 50% this week (from a high IV rank of 56 to 25). This drop in volatility to lows for Tesla while the VIX is in its 20s makes it even dangerous to sell Tesla premium. I even noticed Tom Sosnoff frustrated about this on Tastytrade live both Monday and Tuesday.I find implied volatility fascinating and it is is one of our biggest allies as options traders so I love this conversation. Thanks everyone for commenting and please keep the convo going :)
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 06:21:40'] As someone who sold Puts on tsla last week, I’m happy about this.. perhaps S&P inclusion leading to less vol? No clue, but I’m fine with it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 07:57:09'] Tesla volatility has been insane. I have been selling volatility since last week and it has been working very well. Think about it the news about S&P inclusion is already priced in. We might get a bit of chop but I see no reason for insane volatility. Furthermore inclusion into the S&P 500 will drop volatility into the future.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 11:13:40'] I can't predict what will happen when the stock goes into the index, but I can tell you this the stock hasn't done jack for 1.5 weeks. Also, this Benzinga [Analyst article](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/12/18808535/tesla-fated-for-similar-downfall-as-tilray-stock-to-hit-60-80-levels-in-2021-says-l) appeared a couple of days ago bashing Tesla. I also read an article by someone else, can't find it, that said Tesla cars are one of the least reliable cars of any automaker.Lastly, why would Elon sell $5 billion of shares now if he thinks he can get more after his company gets listed?Too many things pointing that the stock is going down. Time for a different investment.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 17:43:32'] I already sold the strangles last week for this week and collected a nice amount. https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kbbr2g/short_wide_tesla_strangles_next_week_will_print/You gotta be a bit early on these and collect the theta through this week every single day. Now it's too late since it's fairly priced for this Friday.I would be ok with selling backdated vol though still, where gamma/theta tradeoff isn't as steep.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-16 07:08:57'] It decreased due to MM manipulation. They dumped shares, driving the price down, causing people to sell OOM options thereby reducing demand and price, i.e., IV. This stock is *heavily* manipulated.

POST_TEXT: b'I have been day trading small quantities of TSLA shares. Today I bit the bullet and purchased 100 shares at $805 (and then it ran down to $791). I am debating if I should hold my position and write options for July (805 strike has a premium of $140.25 or Jan 2022 805 strike for $218) or take a loss and sell the shares. I know there is going to be a lot of volatility in the short term, but I think Tesla is a long term play. I am thinking if it falls in the short term, I can buy back the option and then keep rolling it? Does that sound like a sound strategy? Thanks in advance for your help!'
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 17:52:28'] Why not just sell weekly calls at the 805 strike?
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 19:50:41'] Are you prepared to lose not only on the shares, but also take a loss on the option when you close it out prior to selling the shares at an even bigger loss? Not cutting losses is the biggest fallacy. What were you were thinking without having an exit strategy? Did you value the company? Is it currently trading above that value?I always value the company and never sell unless a fundamental has changed. Opening contracts when you don’t even have a plan in mind is a horrible idea. Formulate a plan and stick to it. The options weren’t part of your original plan, you’re being emotional. If you can’t refrain from psychological pitfalls like revenge trading take a step back
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 20:43:53'] I typed a bunch of shit, it sounded condescending (because i'm kind of drunk) and i certainly didn't mean it to be, so i'll just say this:Short term is better if you want the exit strategy of buying back the option and exiting your shares.If you sell the 2022 option and the stock loses 20%, you'll probably have to close at like $170, so you only made $50x100 = $5k, but you would have lost $16k on the price of the shares. if you sell a $795 for this Friday, break even closed at $812 today (it will open lower tomorrow), but if you get exercised you're up $700 and you don't have to stress about the $80k in play.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 20:22:34'] Just go full thetagang and sell some 30 DTE CCs. Since you're looking for an exit, you could even go more aggressive with like .4 or even .5 delta. March 19 calls in that range are currently $3500-$4500 premium a pop. This would instantly make your cost basis lower than current share price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 21:48:12'] You’re just experiencing buyer’s remorse. Not a bad idea if you’re bullish on TSLA; sell OTM weekly CCs. Don’t let the naysayers dissuade you; they are not going to come in and manage your money. Zooming out: if you believe in the underlying asset, this is a good enough investment+trading strategy. If you want to maximize returns on every penny you have, feel free to explore ideas/advice mentioned in thetagang
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 17:52:53'] Tough one. If you want to liquidate capital sell a close to the money call and break even.  Have to weigh shit. I have been buying CSPs in $TSLA on margin so no interest. Honestly I own TSLA but makes me nervous when it goes down as I don’t put that much in one play. But $725 strike for Friday I am comfortable with.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 19:00:59'] Dude. On 1/29, I spent $505 on a $1220 TSLA 3/5C. Please don’t underestimate the stupidity of people. Who knows? Maybe in a few weeks when I have made $500+ on an tendie tree, I’ll send the $505 your way. Cheers mate! 🍻
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 23:44:52'] I do CCs on a few hundred shares of Tesla, so I’m going to pretend I know what I’m talking about. If you don’t want to lose the shares, for the love of god, don’t write 805s and don’t go for far dated calls. 5 months in a stock like tsla is forever. Aim to write 850-900s 1-4 weeks out and be prepared to roll if they get overrun. Ideally wait for a pop and write the calls then.Aim for $750-1000 per week and adjust strikes as necessary. Having shorter dated positions will give you flexibility if the stock runs up.Edit: in another reply you said you were worried about a slump. If you think Tesla is going to go down then why hold the stock at all. If you’re worried about a market dip in general, just sell CCs all the way down and all the way up.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 21:54:56'] Sell calls after it runs, not when it pulls back. If you sell a call here your double fucked. You’ll either have to buy the call for a loss or take a profit on the call while getting hosed more on the shares. TSLA is massively overvalued IMO but no real damage has occurred until a close on volume below $700-$750. I wouldn’t be shocked if it hit $500 or $1200 in the next 6 months though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-17 03:49:45'] If you are turning your day trade into a swing trade you are doing something wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-17 05:06:03'] I have had some success with TSLA (non traditional LEEPS), only going 90-120 days out, buying OTM strikes that I believe are within range, so 100 -150 points higher than current price.  Then sell the weekly or every two weeks out at the same strike, rinse and repeat.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-17 06:26:17'] Yeah dont do that.You’d have to see tesla shares gap up 50 points on you and you saying good bye to all those potential profits,Sell more OTM closer to 30-45 days,Don’t worry about this pull back, its quite overdue and probably just started. Unless some big news hit
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-17 16:39:32'] You are a noob.  If you are day trading tsla then what the fuck are you doing holding it to eod.  And if you are buying 100 shares then you should expect 790s to be just part of daily fluctuations.  You have no business day trading 100 shares tsla.  Its beyond your risk tolerance.  Now you are contemplating holding to 2022 LOL.  So what is it are you day trading or long term investing?  If you cant figure it out then your capital will vanish.  Thanks for playing.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 17:52:49'] Dear OP,Check this guys video out about Tesla and his projections.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 19:05:34'] 100 shares of TSLA is a lot of money to have tied down for selling covered options. Have you considered selling naked options? You need to apply for a margin account, but you will not have to set aside 100% cash to cover selling naked options.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-05 12:37:02'] Seems like a crap shoot.  The last time TSLA was at $600 it eventually continued to $900.  Who knows what it will do the next time it hits $600.  I feel TSLA is overvalued, but there are many less profitable companies that are arguably more overvalued than TSLA that are worth buying put options on.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 15:40:45'] A few thoughts in more detail below, but you got very lucky. Don't count on trades like this working out for you in the future.* From how you described it, you didn't actually make a mistake. It sounds like you fully intended to buy the calls after already having the IC open, right? The fact that you already had a short call position at the 1050 strike doesn't matter. Whether you're buying 2 calls to go from a position of -2 to 0 or from a position of 0 to 2, it's the same change in exposure.* That being said, it's not clear to me what the logic behind buying the 1050 calls was. It sounds like it was just a bet that the underlying would go up, which is inconsistent with the thesis behind an IC, which is that the underlying will stay rangebound. You got lucky that the underlying went up significantly. If the underlying had gone down instead of further up like it actually did, or even just gone up a small amount, you could easily have had a loss, especially with something as volatile as TSLA.* It can be very dangerous to leg out of a spread or IC like you did. The point of an IC is that the different legs offset each other. When you remove a leg, the overall position becomes much more exposed and sensitive to directional movements in the underlying. You got lucky that this worked out in your favor here, but it could have easily gone in the other direction. You profited from the long call leg of your IC gaining a lot in value as the underlying went further up, while you didn't have a short call leg whose value would drop at the same time to offset it. Consider if the underlying had gone down instead. The remaining long call would have dropped in value much harder than if you had both a short and long call, since there would have been no corresponding gain from a short call to help offset the loss from the long call.* Different people have different strategies and risk appetites, but I also really don't like the initial IC trade. It's incredibly narrow for an IC, and with something as volatile as TSLA, you're looking at a very high probability that the IC ends up at max loss on one side or the other.

TSLA prices are heavily affected by news. It really needs a catalyst to really go up, and I don't expect one to appear for at least a week. Though I have stock + (mostly) bullish spreads.* TSLA 7 Shares* TSLA 07/16/2021 Call 620/630* TSLA 07/09/2021 Call 657.5/665* TSLA 07/16/2021 Put 735/730. To offset some delta (\~2 shares worth), probably cancel out by buying more TSLA shares premarket if price going up hard Monday premarket and close once market opens.* TSLA Position: 12.75 Delta and 4.95 Theta (A bit lower than I'd like, likely roll some low theta spreads soon).
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-27 21:42:46'] You’re missing the huge territory covered by the long red candles in March. All the action after this has been within these big drops. The upside after that V bounce is every major fund dumping after they realized Michael Burry was correct. Prices in Japan dropped. China sales are slowing. There is no proprietary value with TSLA vehicles. It’s a good stock to swing trade. But puts sound very attractive.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 15:35:59'] Is there a way to forego the increase in value of a put option as the underlying approaches the strike price, in exchange for paying less for that option up front?I understand that at expiration, the strike price forms a clear boundary between an option having value and being worthless. But I would like the option to function in that manner all the way up until that time, if I can get it for cheaper (or offset the cost with a sale).So let's say I am in a stock that is trading at $100 a share, and I want insurance to "kick in" if it goes below $90, but am okay with that insurance being worth zero at any price point above that.Normally if I buy a put with a 90 strike and the stock goes down to $95, the put would be worth more than what I paid (assuming enough time is left until expiration). But I want to forego all of that increase (is that called "time premium" perhaps?) if I can pay as little as possible for that option at the point of purchase. (I understand that "paying less" may translate into me selling a different option to offset the cost of the put.)Then, as soon as the stock goes to $89.99, I'd like to have the fair value of that option kick in at that point. But anything above $90, it's okay if it's worthless, for the entire life of the contract.I hope this isn't stupid. It was a much more concise question in my head!
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-10 21:18:04'] what is the downside risk to buying a straddle on a stock before earnings announcement with 2 months till expiration and selling to close right before the earnings announcement? I mean IV pretty much always increases the closer a stock gets to an earnings announcement right? I chose two months out so you can buy the options and don’t have to worry about theta decay if you plan to sell to close within the next couple of days. Say you buy the straddle 1 week before earnings, the IV should ago up thus causing gains in the options value right? Then you sell and boom profit.Can someone please explain because Ik there’s a risk but I can’t figure out what it is.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-15 07:17:37'] Double diagonal (DD) for the earnings:I have tried other strategies but it seems like solely on  risk reward basis double diagonal is the most prudent option strategy to play earnings. The obvious caveat being picking a too volatile stock and post earnings move shoot through either of the calls or puts legs. Do you use DD for earnings? Do you close the whole position on the first expiration/on the day of earnings? What else should I watch out for while employing DD? Thanks fellas!!P.S. I noticed bid-ask spread is very wide since we are both buying and selling 4 options.

The buyer for the call part of your straddle may be different from the buyer of the put part of your straddle correct? And both the call and put part of your option must be sold at the same time right?I guess I'm talking about when you're looking for better than bid price for both call and put you're trying to sell.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 16:21:16'] Can someone explain why a long straddle with strike price significantly above the current market price is not a guaranteed win? I feel like I am missing something.ATEN is trading at $15.83 at market close. A Long Straddle for a $17.50 strike price with a net bid of $0.50 shows the break even point as $17.00 on the low end and $18.00 on the high end and Fidelity is showing a total premium of $51.30 with their fees included. Why wouldn't I enter this position then close it immediately? If I'm understanding correctly the gain would be $17.00 (low end) - $15.83 (market price) = $1.17 * 100 = $117.00. This would leave a profit of $65.70 when accounting for the premium.There has to be something I'm not understanding...right? Is it that the likelihood of a buyer existing to close out those positions is slim-to-none?

These puts are almost always near the end, having expiration dates about 6 months out, but I have seen both ITM and OTM puts like this.  I just can’t quite figure this out, is there some factor I am not thinking of here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 07:15:20'] I have a put option with strike at $2 that was $0.4 per option when the underlying stock was selling at $5.5 yesterday, today the stock went down to $4.2 yet the option fell in price to $0.29 - I would assume the price would have climbed but didn't, what am i missing here?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 07:28:41'] Why cant i close my options?&#x200B;Very new to options trading so i bought some lower cost puts on RH. When i tried to close them out of the money before expiration my close out contract was pending all day then cancelled at close. Is it because it was so far out of the money no one wanted it?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 08:22:41'] I'm getting smoked on a CC. My strike was passed two days ago BUT the option doesn't expire until 1.27.23. Wrestling with whether I should roll out and up now or wait closer to expiry. I understand I have two weeks and the stock could retreat a bit, I guess my fear is I'd get exercised early.And yes I guess I was sorta lying to myself. If I got my shares called away I'd break even because I'd be selling at my basis...but now I'm thinking of trying to sell at a gain.All the thoughts are appreciated. Thanks!

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 09:53:27'] In a demo account, I had bought a call on SPY and the current value of the contract is more than what I paid for the call option, but I have an unrealized loss. I'm not sure why this is, could it be some sort of glitch with the platform I am using considering its only a demo account, or am I missing something? I don't understand how I can have a loss if the current value of the contract is worth more than what I paid for it.

I see a Director selling a bunch, but it's all "indirect".  I've been Googling around and can't find a straight answer.  Does this mean he doesn't have any control over the selling and it's all pre-determined somehow?I've found this below on difference between "direct" and "indirect", but based on it, I'm not sure if an insider selling listed as "indirect" does necessarily mean that person is bearish on the company.Direct Stock:  The stock matches on the screened individual's name.Indirect Stock:  The stock matches on another name than that of the individual screened (Foundation, trust, estate, or Business name) that the stock is listed under.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-13 21:05:36'] What can be reasons why institutions would sell deep ITM put options for existing stock in their portfolio?Background: the spiking P/C ratio in December had some people freaking out saying it was super bearish, and others pointing out that no, context matters.  Stuff like much shorter dated options activity that's ramped up.  Also I was watching a podcast that mentioned part of the spike was institutions selling deep ITM puts, and rolling them, collecting income and not having to worry about counterparty doing early exercise.  They stated it's a neutral strategy, not bearish, because you have to hold the underlying.CBOE actually commented on this P/C ratio spike and confirmed deep ITM put on tech like AMZN : https://www.cboe.com/insights/posts/how-early-exercise-order-flow-impacts-equity-option-put-call-ratios/I understand early exercise rarely happens because you're throwing away extrinsic value, but for deep ITM, you have more intrinsic over extrinsic.  I'm trying to wrap my head around it.  If you own 200 shares of ABC at current price $100- sell 2 deep ITM put options with strike $120 - collect premium of $20 each (2 * 20 = $40 total premium received) - ABC goes down, puts go up in value, you're losing on both stock and option, counterparty is winning- ABC goes up, puts go down in value, you're winning on both stock and option, counterparty is losingAs long as ABC does not go below $100, the trade is profitable for you?  How is this neutral?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 19:11:09'] I have been paper trading for a few weeks with a specific strategy. I can't imagine that this is real, but I've had huge success with it. I'm buying vertical spreads on SPY deep ITM which expire same day. Basically, I looked back in time and found that the S&P doesn't often fall more than 2% in any given day. I buy a spread first thing in the morning at 2% below opening or even lower if it's dropped already for the day.I'm buying 10 contracts for $4,000 - $4,500. I then put a sell limit a little above that, say $4,200 - $4,700. Most days I make about $1,000 after buying/selling multiple times. I risk about $4,000 at a time. I've had a few hit expiration as well. Even on negative market days, I'm winning.Tell me why this is working so easily in paper trading and why it's not just that easy to make money. I've read a little on the subject but haven't seen anything quite specific enough to convince me of the reason.What I've come up with is that when I'm buying a contract, in the real world I'd have to have a seller at my price. In paper trading, I don't need a real seller. It just happens if the price hits my limit. The same would be true for selling then. Is this a correct understanding?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-09 02:18:37'] Very big delta difference based on strike. Why does this happen? and what does this mean?https://imgur.com/a/76sWuev the screenshot is on **Friday 30 min before market close**. the screen shot is of **ORMP january exp date**. but its the same outlook for february.i was wondering if someone can explain what this means and why it does this?the underlying bid/ask is at 11.58/11.64 respectively. lets just say 11.60 for the mid to make it easier.the closest strike available for an OTM put is the $10 strike. its delta is 0.2830. the $10 strike is 13.8% from current stock price.however, the next closest strike for an OTM call is 12.5. yet, its delta is 0.5747. but its only a 7.75% upside increase.the closest OTM call strike to the nearest OTM put strike (the $10 put) is the $20 OTM call at 0.2622 delta. which is a 72.4138% increase from the 11.60 underlying price.why does this happen? and what does this mean?i was first looking to open a long strangle or straddle in this position. but that caught my eye. as i wont be delta neutral with the closest strikes. (I know a long strangle/straddle isnt a theta play. but i was wondering this concept in general)

Similar to how folks will look at a loaded option chain on the call side for a ticker and automatically assume GaMmA SqUeeZe possible.So when I hear a fintwit guru talk about "MMs are majority short gamma in SPX" or "vanna flows are not as strong this year", is the data they're looking at proprietary, or something any retail trader can look at?There are subscriptions services I've seen like Spotgamma and Vexly.

Need helps It’s from section 4 “gramma trading and portfolio of options ”:In the case of a rally from $100 upwards, the long $95/$90 put spread position will simply make profits from gamma hedges.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 14:46:56'] I had call options for a security that would expire on the 20th of Jan 23 At the strike price of 2,5. I asked the broker how can i exercise the options to buy the stock before expiration. I was told it was not possible on their platform. At that time i was Ok with this as i was bullish on the performance, but disappointed as i never saw anything that it would not be possible. The reason i would have wanted to buy the stock was because the market price was 20x the strike price and selling the options would not have resulted in any meaningful profits as they were still extremely cheap.Few days later i get a margin call. I notice my balance was negative. I immediately sent them a message and email asking what was happening as i never used margin and only had bought call options. Next thing i know they are closing my positions to cover the margin call. I called the broker to ask what is happening as this was impossible.They said there had been an error in their platform resulting in them giving me 10x More options than i had paid for, and the price updated a few days later which caused a margin call. The Person on the phone was very helpful so i asked a few questions about trading options on their platform. She told me that it was possible to exercise the options early to buy the stock and told me how to do it: message them and give the instructions. (Previously was told it was not possible) also other questions i had about how they handle itm call option expiry as i was led to believe my only option was to sell the option or let it expire, so naturally i wanted to know how they handle expiry. She gave me an answer which was how i originally expected it to work but again was led to believe something else would happen as i had asked this before.Now the issue for me is that at the moment i cannot do anything as majority of my positions have been closed. But i am still negative balance as the same 10x issue is with selling the options. For example, Previously 20 dollar premium became 200 days after transaction, now the same security was sold for the same price as a part of the margin call by the risk management but the account received 20 dollars which would not be enough to cover the margin deficit. This will probably be fixed later. Tldr, broker accidentally gave me 10x More call options which few days later caused a margin call which caused them to close my positions after which i learned that i could have went along with my original strategy after they had misled me to believe it was not possible on their platform (it was possible) and now i have lost almost all positions which i could have turned into approx. 3m profit. Atm waiting for their replyAny suggestions?

How do you account for this? Is it just keeping BPR in line based off VIX levels?Follow up: [here](https://imgur.com/a/IPi7koh) is the SPX beta test on TOS with my opened /MES positions. Based off these market moves, the maintenance req expansion seems very reasonable/predictable. I'm assuming the risk is that brokages will ratchet up their formulas in addition which is what really aggravates the risk
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-05 10:57:53'] I've been wanting to exit a position but am currently down on it. Would the following make sense, why or why not?\- Have: Quantity: 100, Cost/Share: $12.50, Market price: $10.50\- Plan: "Sell to open", covered call, Strike price: $15.00, Unit price: $0.20, expires 60 daysI understand that this nets me $20 (less fees) and may not get exercised by the buyer. However, if it does get exercised I get 100x15.00, and close my position (as intended).If you want to exit a position, why not sell a call option with a strike at or above your cost (to recover your cost if you're down, or make a little extra if you're up)?

(so around 30 min before market close)i was wondering if someone can explain what this means and why it does this?the underlying bid/ask is at 11.58/11.64 respectively. lets just say 11.60 for the mid to make it easier.the closest strike available for an OTM put is the $10 strike. its delta is 0.2830. the $10 strike is 13.8% from current stock price.however, the next closest strike for an OTM call is 12.5. yet, its delta is 0.5747. but its only a 7.75% upside increase.the closest OTM call strike to the nearest OTM put strike (the $10 put) is the $20 OTM call at 0.2622 delta. which is a 72.4138% increase from the 11.60 underlying price.why does this happen? and what does this mean?i was first looking to open a long strangle or straddle in this position. but that caught my eye. as i wont be delta neutral with the closest strikes.

If I think SPY is going below 380 on Monday, how do I execute? 2. If I buy a $7.48 call with strike of $380, is it just a matter of exercising the call & then selling immediately when the market opens to make a profit (albeit only 0.10 per share)?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-06 18:03:10'] Had something crazy happen. Gained on a bear credit spread after the stock shot way up.On 12/13, I entered into a bear call spread on Madrigal Pharmaceuticals (MDGL) with a Jan expiration at the 70/75 short/long strike prices when the stock was trading at around 60. I had a credit of 21.90 on the 70 call and a debit of 20.40 on the 75 call (so a net credit of 1.50). I set up an auto-close order to close the position when the position got to 50% of its max profit value (i.e. when the position could be closed for a net debit of 0.75).    On 12/19, the stock shot up to a 202 opening price, and my position was closed because the 70 call was valued *less* than the 75 call (133.10 for the 70 call vs 140.90 for the 75 call, so a "debit" of -7.80). By all accounts, I should have reached my max loss at such a price.    I should mention this all happened in ToS PaperMoney, so it could be a software bug in the simulator for all I know, but has something like this happened to anyone else before?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-08 08:40:10'] Lets say Call A is 1$ To determine it's true value I have to multiply it by 100. But this is it's value at expiration, right?Because when I bought a call in a paper trade account, it increased 50% so it was worth 1.5$ with 2 days till expiration. But I only had one, so my profit was 50c.So for really short term trading (e. g. 15min.) you would increase the quantity by a lot and buy like 100 calls if you don't intend to wait until expiration. Or do you buy calls that expire very soon? It's very confusing for me right now. Thank you in advance.

The breakeven is \~175.50 and GLD is trading at 177.58 at the time I'm writing this. There's only a 42% of the trade expiring OTM, but there's an 82% chance it touches the breakeven and a 77% chance it touches the short strike. What would you do in this situation? Do you have any general recommendations as to when to cut your losses vs letting the trade play out a little longer?
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 14:03:58'] Help!I sold a put on EAR (they make hearing aids) expires 4/21 it was a .50 strike for which I was paid .10 in premium the stock price was around .62 at the time.  Yesterday they did a 20 to 1 reverse stock split and now the price is $10.67 per share and my EAR put is now an EAR1 put. Still a .50 put with the same expiration date but now  the ask (for me to buy it back) is .50.So what is this now?  What happens if I get assigned? I assume I'm buying 5 shares at $10 a piece?But, If I try to buy to close when I preview the order it says;"You’re paying $5.00 to buy back 1 open contract which will release collateral and remove your obligation to buy 5 shares of EAR for $0.50 each on or before April 21."I assumed the $50 was at stake as collateral to buy $50 worth of this adjusted stock but is my obligation really only to buy 5 shares (the adjusted amount) at  .50/share (the preadjusted amount)? So $2.50?Is there any sense in placing a buy to close order at say .05 (remember I was paid .10) to see if it fills while the ask is .50 (new big boy number) or do I just wait till 4/21 and get my $50 collateral back knowing this is a dead man walking because it's not going anywhere near .50 by then.OR am I reading this wrong and my $50 might still be at stake?Many Thanks for any insight.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-18 14:04:01'] Debit spread question.    So I buy a debit spread for 2.50.   A month later the stock has risen and the spread is in the money by 1.00. So it should be worth 5.00.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 09:03:15'] Is there a way to see if the price of the stock is more-so moving as a result of technical analysis or fundamental analysis (When no major company/economic news occurs)? For example, if you look at Apple and specifically analyze the 4 hour timeframe you'll see pretty big movements in the stock that seem to respect the support and resistance levels and as a result move $20-$40. You of course see many times when it doesn't respect those support/resistance levels. Is it possible that the price of Apple or any stock actually moves say $30 from technical analysis alone? I guess I'm somewhat surprised that a company's stock can be that affected by technical analysis alone (If this is true).

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 11:10:57'] Question on how Robinhood (or other brokers) represent options value in your account.I think i have an idea of how this works but I've always been curious. Así understand it, when I sell a put or a call the premium comes directly to me at the time of sale and becomes cash i can use. However, i am now linked to the contract which can fluctuate in value. I never see and immediate jump in my percentage gains for the day when I sell a contract, so I'm assuming that even if i get the money in my account, Robinhood only represents gains or losses on the contract as it fluctuates prior to expiration. In other words, if i make 500 premium from a contract, i will immediately have 500 dollars more in my account but I won't see it represented as gains until the contract expires worthless (let's assume that's what happens for this example). Is all this correct?A second question is, let's say i have hold a stock and sold call on it. If, prior to expiration the stock price rises above the strike i sold at, i basically won't see any gains represented as the stock rises past the strike, correct? The increasing intrinsic value of the call above the strike should basically negate any actual gains i make in the underlying stock, regardless of the time value left on the call, right?Thanks for the help.

The value goes up to $4 due to the underlying increasing in price. How do I benefit from this without exercising (buying the 100 shares at the exercise price) and immediately selling the shares at the current price?If I sell the calls I’ll have the obligation to sell the shares to the buyer at the exercise price, which I don’t want because I don’t own the shares. Is there a way to benefit from the price of the calls going up without buying or selling the shares (exercising or shorting)?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-19 20:55:27'] Hello , I started learning options yesterday and looked through the introductions for options and I am still kind of confused about intrinsic and extrinsic value. I understand that ITM options only have intrinsic value whereas OTM and ATM options have Extrinsic value only   But I do not understand this scenario online "Assume a trader buys a put option on XYZ stock. The stock is trading at $50, and the trader buys a put option with a strike price of $45 for $3. It expires in five months. If the stock falls below the put strike price of $45, then the option will have intrinsic value. For example, if the stock falls to $40, the option has $5 in intrinsic value. If there is still time until the option expires, that option may trade for $5.50, $6, or more, because there is still extrinsic value as well"  Wait so what it is saying is that if i bought this OTM Put it will have intrinsic value if the stock falls to $40? but won't it contradict the statement whereby OTM options only have extrinsic value? Or is this because the OTM option became ITM? im so confused. And also , if bought an ITM call of the same XYZ stock $45 at eg $5 , and the stock price drops to $40 , does that mean by ITM call loses all its intrinsic value and we just lose the premium right?

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-20 15:13:08'] Hi everyone, forgive me if this is the dumbest question ever posted, but I am new here so bear with me...    I opened an iron condor on UNH, exp Feb 3. When I placed the order, UNH was trading at $486.72    Sold the $495 call, and $475 put.    Purchased the $507.5 call, and $460 put. I took in $5.08 in credits. My max profit was $797 and max loss was $397    I was immediately down $168 with no real shift in the underlying... a few pennies. I thought that if you opened a position, you should immediately be at $0 gain/loss (give or take a little) since you should theoretically be able to liquidate at the price you took it in. I know this isn't perfect... there can be slippage, some pricing discrepancies in the market, and some movement in the underlying in that very short time, commissions, etc. But to be down about 40% of your max loss in an instant seems strange. Am I missing something? Does this happen often?

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 23:05:14'] A strategy I've been using some lately has been to look for stocks that pumped in AH on legit good news and has sky-high IV, then watch for a pullback that day (usually will happen in the morning) and sell puts then.  Pick a price that it shouldn't drop below.Example: ARVN had cancer drug news that sent their stock from $25-$30 to $70 over night.  It immediately pulled back to $60 and then at noon pulled back to $55, which is where I sold a -40p+25p spread that expired that week, for 0.68.  My logic was that even if the stock did nothing but pull back for the rest of the week it would probably still end above $40.  I ended up buying back the spread the next day for 0.10.  (Well, technically I only bought back the short put, the 25p was unsellable.)If you're careful about the strikes of the puts you sell your only real risk should be tail risk... in the ARVN example if it had come out that the results had been falsified the stock could have dropped like a rock and I would have had to eat maximum loss.  That said, the reversal would have to happen fast, because I usually take my profit within a day or three.An extra warning: don't do this if you don't know why the stock pumped, and you need to think the pump was for a good reason.  If it's just randomly pumping it could just be pumping and dumping, and if it's pumping for a bad reason it could dump once people figure that out.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-06 17:43:34'] Looks like you have a $5 wide spread. If you close tomorrow, you’ll take the max loss. If you roll and pay $200, and TSLA doesn’t go the way you want, you would be at a loss of $200 plus your current max loss. Simply, with your roll, you’re taking max loss and opening a new position that has a $200 max loss. Look at that new position, do you like it? Would you open it today had you not have the losing spread? If so, go ahead and roll. If not, take your loss and find a better use for those $200.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-07 01:00:58'] There's no hard rule saying you cannot roll with a debit.  You just have to treat every roll as closing your current position and entering a new one.  If you think TSLA has hit support then there's nothing wrong with rolling to give yourself more time for it to make a comeback, even if you have to pay for it.You just have to really ask yourself if you're rolling just because you want to hold the bag and putting good money after bad money, or you are rolling because you really think it has hit support.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-13 18:24:45'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-13 22:11:47'] The mistake here was doing it in TSLA.  I would recommend AMZN in the future.In all seriousness, you have to understand that if you keep re-adjusting your strikes, as long it moves a lot in the future, you'll keep losing money.  Your trade is a pure implied vol vs. realized vol trade, since as long as future realized vol > implied vol (adjusted to your skew strangle), you'll lose.  So far, it's been realizing far more than the implied vol.Also, I'm not sure on your expiration but given you have 75k premium left, I assume these are mid dated options too (so not LEAPS but not weeklies either), so it'll take you a long time to collect this premium (for the vol to become theta), even if it stays range bound.As someone who is bullish TSLA, I think TSLA is probably somewhat overvalued at this point, but the thing is even if it crashes back down, you still lose because you readjusted your strikes and now you'll lose on your put side instead of the call side.  Also the thing is you never known when it will come back because clearly it's in the middle of a massive short squeeze right now and can go up a ton more.  TSLA IV is also probably too high and cannot possibly maintain this level forever, but in that case, if you just want to sell vol, I recommend you open up like a condor with like 200 dollar wide ATM options for your base part of the condor or something rather than a strangle/straddle, and make sure to do it on leap options (2021), so you aren't as gamma exposed and so the next stock you invest it isn't ROPE.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-13 22:34:50'] If your thesis changed, close the trade. You don't need to be in the trade to follow the outcome.If your thesis hasn't changed, keep rolling it. Up, down, or further out. If you can handle the risk.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-13 18:59:06'] You could hold the call strike and keep rolling it until it comes back down again and hedge with the short put, going inverted if you have to.   You might be able to convert some of the intrinsic value of the short call into extrinsic value eventually.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-13 23:55:52'] Dude what the actual fuck are you doing!? The SP is clearly going parabolic and volatile as fuck yet you continue trying to strangle it like a low volatility blue Chip?? With earnings coming out soon too! Just close out your trade and think of a better strategy or you will get mauled when/if it crashes on the downside as well.

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-13 19:12:31'] Unless you leave the challenged side alone (short call) or only roll for even, or a credit, you’ve already realized the loss.Granted nobody wants to be a hundred-some-odd points in the money on a short call, however if you were, and the price came back down near the call strike again you’d erase the loss due to getting all that intrinsic value back.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-29 20:00:06'] You're fine, dude.  First of all, do you have 100 shares of Tesla? If so, it's not a big deal. I assume you just naked-called it, which is crazy, but can't be undone. So you need to find 100 shares.  Here's what you do:Sell a 975 put. That'll put cash in your pocket. Use that to buy a 985 call. Either:a) TSLA closes at around 900, so the calls don't matter, and your ITM put went way down in value, so you can buy it back with a bit of profit (whatever you didn't spend on the 985 call). Happy day.b) TSLA closes at 976, so the new Put is OTM, and you get assigned. You lose $100, big whoop.c) TSLA closes at 1000 or something. Both calls are ITM, you exercise one, get assigned the other, and you lose $500 on that but you keep the new put's premium, which oughta be decent and take the edge off.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-29 18:30:27'] Either: buy back the puts, this should reduce your maintenance requirement, then clench tight and wait it out while closely monitoring through expiry. Or, close out the call at a loss and ride the puts to expiry to soften the blowOr close it all out bc you took on too much risk here and you should just exit at a small loss so it doesn't blow up on you. And learn from it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-30 00:17:10'] Leave it. There's only two days left in the week.  Unless you're going to go bankrupt if you lose 2k then you need to leave it.  It's not going to 1100 by Friday.  You did something incredibly stupid but you're probably fine.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-29 19:47:10'] You're going to be fine by open. You may get margin called, but you'll have four days to satisfy the call by which time the option will have expired. If you think the price will exceed 980 before end of day (I don't think so), you can buy a call to cap your losses.
	COMMENT: ['2020-04-29 19:49:47'] Is this a covered call? If so, I may just be confused because I'm also a newbie. What would be the problem with being assigned if you have it covered? You would lose money, but that's the nature of selling calls.

	COMMENT: ['2020-04-29 21:30:30'] You will be fine. Tomorrow there will be a big IV crush which will reduce the value of the option. If the stock is at $981 at 3pm on Friday you are going to be on the hook for $100 essentially. If it’s at $1000 you’ll owe $2000, but Honestly the chances this thing runs another 15% from where it closed AH is low, even for Tesla.

POST_TEXT: b'EDIT: I added some strategies.\n\nStrategy 6 below seems more comfortable to me, but I am considering a few ideas. My number one goal from this post is suggestions for either alternative strategies, or an explanation on why you feel one of my suggested strategies might clearly seem best.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI have mostly been buying/selling vertical spreads when it comes to options, but regardless, I\'m new. I have been a "buy and hold shares" investor previously. So, I have done some trading of TSLA shares in the past, and I thought, next time I see a solid dip, I\'m going to buy a call contract. I\'ve made a few bucks doing this with the stock, bring on the leverage of options... guh\n\nI chose TSLA because I felt at $675 they would probably bounce back up, so I bought an atm call 15 days ago for $3850, and it\'s only got a week left (May 21). Stupidly I was not content with the bounce to like $725, when I could have cashed out for \\~50% gain. I got greedy. :(\n\nI opened my options trading acco'
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-14 11:48:10'] honestly, as a new options trader you should be as far away from tesla as you can unless you like giving your money away. as a more direct answer to your questions, i would suggest the longer time similar strike, but you are playing with fire.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-14 14:01:26'] keep the option, treat it as power ball ticket.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-14 21:30:15'] Probably just hold it at this point and look for an opportunity to sell it if Tesla has a good/great day next week. Main issues though are:1) Too large of position size. If 1 trade going bad can have such a negative impact on your account, then that position is too large. With $25k, you probably shouldn't have more than $500 - $1000 at risk in any short-term position. 2) You need to limit your losses either through stop losses or "mental" stop losses where you decide (before entering the position) what % loss you are willing to tolerate before cutting your losses. This depends on your personal risk tolerance as well as the risk/reward of the position. Also consider exit conditions if the position opens way down at market open. The point is, you need to focus first on avoiding massive losses at all costs. Otherwise, you will constantly give up your gains. 3) Don't chase these losses. It happened, it's over, and it's time to move on. Make future trades based on their own merits and not to try to quickly recover losses from this trade. If you try to chase, you may get lucky. Most likely though you will suffer another big loss and go down this cycle until you inevitably blow up your entire account taking riskier and riskier trades. So overall: smaller position sizes and focus on minimizing losses and exiting positions (even at loss) when your predetermined exit conditions are met. If you do these two things, you should rarely have losses significant enough to bother you.
	COMMENT: ['2021-05-15 14:55:04'] Well, no matter how you cut it if you take a bullish position and the share price drops you're gonna lose money. You can sell the higher priced call into a spread to offset losses.You could buy protective puts.Timing is hard and this is a case where shares or deep itm leaps might behoove you.I'm a huge Tesla bear so I won't speculate too much on how to handle a TSLA long position

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-15 00:38:34'] You have two completely independent decisions to make. Keep or sell your current call, and what if anything to do with TSLA next.I advise you to sell your current call, buy some TSLA shares and stop with the mentality of trying to make up for losses. Next time you find yourself convinced that a stock is about to do something, think back to the last time you were that sure.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-19 14:35:41'] Can I get a review of a potential passive profit strategy? Its very simple, its just selling slightly OTM covered calls with 30 DTE and collecting monthly premiums from it. If the stock gets assigned, then I give up the 100 shares and buy 100 shares again from the profit made on selling those shares, and then start the whole process again.I know there are other strategies that can be more profitable depending on various circumstances, but am I right in thinking this can be successful or am I missing something?Thanks

Its known/said that the Calls to Puts ratio is a way to see if the sentiment is bearish or bullish, I.E above 1.0 or under 1.0.So you could say that a stock with a 1.4 Put/Call ratio has quite a bearish sentiment, AKA option holders are thinking the price will go down, hence they buy puts...But could you argue that the sentiment is actually BULLISH since market makers and people are WRITING put options to sell them to bearish people? How do written contracts count into options sentiment, and do contracts that are outstanding and not bough yet are counted into that sentiment or only active positions/trades? Thanks

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-22 06:21:37'] Is there a term or name I can search for the following trade? Say underlying is 100 and I short a put 1x80 strike / long 2x 75 strike/ short 1x70 strike, so first part is short 80 75 spread and second part is a long 75 70 spread. So the extra long 75 strike and short 70 spread would act as a “below hedge”. Theory being it would likely earn some money IF I lost fully on the short spread since odds are a big drop won’t stop at exactly bottom level of short spread. I will look at probability itm on tos for that to decide if worth it, but wondering if it has a name?I know just moving short spread further otm has similar effect but not exact. Ie it guaranteed full loss if drops to 75 and I f don’t do this second long. Net premium revenue less if I do it but almost certainly it gains back some or all of loss on short spread

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-23 05:18:33'] I am a long time option trader (daily Bollinger Band analysis drives the majority of what I trade), but only recently started trading SPX based on trend. I have a strategy that is showing early positive results. Curious if anyone else uses a similar approach as my data set is still small, but trending in the right direction.    \- I only use 1 hour or 4 hour charts. The shorter dated charts don't work for me as I make poor decisions with them.    \- When SPX meets my criteria, I purchase SPX put or call options at least one month out (to minimize theta decay) with a delta of around .20.    \- The trade moves much slower than ATM options and helps me manage risk.    \- If the trade goes my way and has not been stopped out, when delta moves to .40 or more, I take the profits usually via a tight stop.    \- If my indicators tell me there is still profit potential, I start the process over by buying a delta .20 option or downsize to SPY if I feel the largest part of the move is over and the RR is not as favorable.    \- My time in market on this strategy is less than 50%.    TIA for your thoughts.

I'll give an example so it makes more sense. If I buy a SPY call for $379, the stock would have to go up to $383.30 to be profitable, +0.08%.If I buy a SPY call rn for $378 dollars, the stock would have to go up to $383.12 to be profitable, +0.03%.If I bought a SPY call for $377, the stock would have to go up to $383.03, +0.01%.That makes sense to me. The deescalation of how much it needs to go up to be profitable, as well as the higher potential loss since it is closer to the market price. What doesn't make sense is this:If I buy a SPY call for $376, the stock would have to go up to $383.12, 0.03% for profits?Why does it break formula there? I genuinely don't know why that single option breaks the pattern. Sorry like I said I'm really new. Haven't done a single option yet. Want to understand the basics before I do anything else.

A common technique I’ve seen is to buy 10-20% OTM SPY puts with a varied number of DTE (90-120):1/ Do you end up selling these or letting them expire? Theta decay speeds up around 45 DTE so does it make sense to roll them out then?2/ If the puts are ever ITM, how do you think about selling them vs sitting on them until expiry?3/ What percentage of your portfolio is typically allocated to hedging? Is the goal of a hedge to achieve a certain beta weighted delta vs % of portfolio value? If there is a big down move, the other purpose of the puts are to prevent margin call (by expanding in value as the overall portfolio drops) - is there a standard or best practice to avoid margin calls? I’ve seen the buying power utility % vs vix but was wondering if there was something more specific to otm spy puts as hedges

I’m bullish on a stock however don’t understand how the payout works and don’t have the capital to buy the shares I want I’ll break it down in laymen’s for example.I want to buy 1 contract @ $5 strike price @ .01 for 180DTE, so I pay the 100 dollar premium. In 120 days said market value of stock is $10, im content with the profit and am willing to close position. Does that mean I receive $500 dollars in profit because the stock went up $5 dollars? Obviously minus fees and factoring in the premium I already paid.If I’m entering this position I would want to buy to open correct? Because if I do take the contract to expiration I want to buy the stock and without it I don’t have Margin so i wouldn’t be able to sell to close right?But say i take it to the 180DTE mark because now I’m still bullish and think the stock will rise to 15, does that mean I have to buy the 100 shares at strike price when the contract expires? Meaning I have to pay 500 dollars plus the premium I already paid?Sorry if this is a repetitive question, my biggest concern is am I making the right call with buy to open and once in a contract can you just simply close a position and walk away with profit.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-18 16:33:33'] TSLA Implied Volatility Rank is 4.1 and It's implied volatility is 49% (low for TSLA).  I wouldn't be selling premium in any stocks with lower than 15-30 IVR. (50+ IVR is perfect)  The lower the volatility the lower the premium, so premium sellers (like you) should be looking for high volatility and premium sellers should be looking for low volatility.    You should be playing from 45 days until expiration until 21 days of expiration not 4-5 or 7 days. I'll say this about your trades, At least you're collecting a reasonable credit although now that I looked you're at a the .48 delta (basically a coin flip).    Looks like you've been winning a few coin flips in a row, you need to figure out how coin flips work over the long term. When you do - the answer is to move out in terms of days 'to be right' and move out in delta '.16-30' instead of .48    Good luck out there - you're on the right path (selling premium) but you're still doing coin flips with relatively no mechanics.

Currently $524. By buying the put, he pays $40k [575 x $70.58] in hopes that the stock is below $575 at expiry. Seems like his win condition is the same as selling the call? If the stock is below $575 by expiry, he wins on both?And I’m honestly not sure how the shorting comes into play.

Maybe there was enough difference between the price of the options and the price of the shares to justify the trade. At this scale, a short-term arb play might make sense for a few pennies of difference in the stock price.Maybe they already had a short stock short put position, and they converted it to simply a long call position?You could think of 100 different scenarios that might be happening. You just don't know.By the way, who took the other side and sold 57,500 shares, bought the call and sold the put? What do you read into that side of the trade?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 17:24:28'] >The main reason being how you can take larger positions with the same capital at risk.Yes, this is true. However, it also means that your gains are capped. When you're long calls or puts, you have a significantly higher upside potential vs. selling that potential via deeper call or put spread to subsidize the entry debit. However, the better approach will vary depending on the volatility skew, your view, and your risk/reward goals.In your ARKK scenario, you're not exactly comparing the same trades. Buying the 39 put at 4.20 is a much more aggressive trade because you'd need it to go down to 34.80 to break even. It would have to go down to 30.30 to reach the 107% potential the spread trade has. However, ARKK's IV is so high for that term (48%) that there's \~14% chance that it will close below 30.30.The spread, on the other hand, is way less aggressive as you're buying the 42 and selling the 39 for 1.45. It breaks even once you hit 40.55 with the potential for as much as a 1.55 gain at or below 39 for a capped 107% gain.If you're moderately bearish and expecting a 0 to -1 vol move in the underlying (31.18-45.01), the spread trade has a much better return profile at an average of 38% for the model. The naked put would be -50%.However, if you're very bearish and expecting a -0.5 to -2 vol move in the underlying (21.59-37.46), the naked put would average 90% while the spread would cap at 107%. The big difference is that the long put trade would produce a gain 315% if ARKK closes at 21.59.I'm not saying you should have a preference for single-leg or spreads or whatever. It's more that options are awesome because of how well they enable you to finely tune your strategy to express a really precise view. That's also why it's very useful to have tools that do all the heavy lifting to compare which trades are best for a given view as it really depends on the underlying probabilities and option pricing at any given time.Just remember that the expected return on any given option is 0. In other words, the fair price of an option is calculated to break even. That's why market makers are willing to simultaneously buy or sell a given option for a slight (or sometimes not-so-slight) edge in the bid/ask spread. This means that you need to be not just correct about the direction, magnitude, and timing, but you also need to be *more* correct than the market.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 16:57:17'] One of the main differences between the two is the curve of the risk graph.  If ARKK were drop to $39 in a week, the 39 put would be up roughly $170 whereas the spread would be profiting around $105.  Then from there, the 39 put would eventually decay to zero and expire worthless by September and the spread get max profit is ARKK is at 39 or less.  This was calculated as one 39 put for 4.10 vs three 42/39 spreads at 1.28 each for a total of 3.84.  I tried to make the capital as close as possible.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 17:22:11'] It just depends what risk you want to have on. By doing the put instead of the equivalent value in put spreads, you get roughly 8 more deltas, .012 more gamma, .083 more vega and pay .011 more theta. So, just analyze the position. If the stock moves to $39 in the next month, the ROI on the put is likely much better. At that point, the put will have a 40ish delta and the spread will have something like a 10 delta. Your pnl from delta and gamma will be greater with the put than the spread. On the other hand if the stock grinds down over the next 6 months and hits $38 in late August, those puts probably get crushed by theta and trade not far from intrinsic. At that point, if they’re trading for something like $1.20, the spread will be trading for not much less than that and so the ROI on the spread will be greater. Point being, it depends what risk you want on and that depends what you forecast the stock doing. Outright calls and puts benefit from quicker moves and vol increases, and lose when volatility dies and theta crushes them. It’s easier to just look at the actual greeks of each trade and decide what is better depending on your forecasts.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 16:27:16'] Spreads are the hardest to repair, plus you are capped when you are using spreads! If you position size a long call per se, you can take a maximum loss and still come out ahead as an 80/20 rule will be rewarded if you do enough long calls! The spreads, even with position size, is hard to go to max loss many times and still come out as profitable! Many have blown up their accounts from spreads.I bet many here can testify to that! Need a lot of risk management education for spreads!
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 16:48:35'] Finally a sensible post.Spreads allow you to minimize the effect of theta and define both your loss and your gain. It is the quintessence of options trading. The idea is to set the spread at a width where the underlying moves typically for the period of the expiration. You're looking for singles and maybe doubles, not home runs.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 16:23:38'] There is no reason to use one or the other inherently. Spreads allow you to simply pay less.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 16:34:53'] No.The delta of the long put would be -0.30.The delta of the spread would be .30 - .37 = -0.07.So if ARKK went down by $1, the put would gain 0.30, a 7.3% gain.The spread would gain 0.07, a 5.4% gain.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 22:56:22'] Over time I’ve become a bigger fan of spreads than a single long leg mainly because you can reduce theta decay. Don’t forget your long leg can also be ITM if you want to increase your overall delta but it’ll cost you more
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 00:04:51'] Spreads are the way to go. Perfect for beginners, small accounts and experienced traders. To give your spreads some extra bit of edge, pull up IV % for each strike in your option chain. You’ll know spreads are a good choice when you see IV% increasing the further out of the money you go. That means you’ll be able to buy a cheaper spread as the option you’re selling contains higher IV than the one you’re buying.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 08:26:42'] Credit or Debit?I use vertical Credit Spreads, because my losses are capped, no matter how much the market moves, and rolling is king to cover those losses. People say your profits are capped, but I'm perfectly happy making a good ROI in a day, every day.  Your key takeaway from the above posts are that YOU need to analyze what strategy is best for YOU. All strategies will lose money, and all strategies will make money.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 09:06:18'] I think of it as trading delta/gamma for theta and vega.In other words, you won't see huge gains from a big move with a vertical, but you can greatly neutralize the effect of time and volatility changes. Or set yourself up so time is beneficial. You can usually achieve lower breakevens than you can with singles, which will increase your win rate.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 16:08:44'] Spreads are defined risk, so you know how much you can lose at expiration before opening the trade.Just make sure you would be good with that max loss and trading spreads is fine.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-15 22:38:19'] It always seems better to hedge a position with some offsetting lighter position.  You lower your cost basis, decrease risk, and may even make more money if you guess right.  Prefer diagonal spreads to vertical spreads, but anything’s fine.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 13:30:24'] When comparing a long put and a put vertical where both positions are short the same put, on an expiration basis, the equivalence price is the short strike less the premium received for it.  Above that price, the spread outperforms.  Below that price, the long put outperforms.  Therefore, the desirability of one versus the other depends on the performance of the underlying.    For example, long the XYZ $100p for $5 versus the vertical that is long the XYZ $100p for $5 and short the $95p for $3 (net cost $2).  At $92 ($95 - $3), the standalone long put is worth $8 for a gain of $3 whereas the spread has achieved its maximum gain of $3 ($5 spread with a cost of $2).  So above $92, the spread outperforms.  Below $92, the long put outperforms.    Before expiration, the P&L depends on what the price of the underlying, IV, and theta decay.  But it's still the same idea.  Since both positions are long the same option, which one outperforms is determined by what the $95 put does.  If it's worth less than the $3 credit received (IV change and/or theta decay), the spread outperforms.  If it's worth more than $3, the standalone long put outperforms.  This is easier to visualize if you have an option program that can graph multi-legged positions before expiration.    And then there's the issue of less cash at risk with the spread that you mentioned.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-16 18:41:21'] Spreads give you a defined max win/loss while theoretically your gains on puts and calls are unlimited .I used to only trades verticals thinking that's where the money was at. I am now a full time scalper on str8 up calls and puts
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-17 11:39:04'] Because in your above trade if the stock goes to 25 you capped gains at 39.  Your spread bets you make the max 39 or lower.  You would buy the puts outright if you have the capital and your bet is it will go down 50%

In the last 12 mins it went from up 20 percent to up 10 percent. 940am CtThe point is, TSLA does not have movement like most equities. Even for TSLA this parabolic movement is not normal. It is safe to say the bear case for the most part has been mitigated, but that should not have caused the meteoric rise. The point is, once we get to a natural plateau and ppl start selling (taking profit, fear dumping, etc.) those that go long, trading options will get crushed. And vice versa for the shorts, depending on the direction of movement.

Shares up nearly $28, or 6% to $498 this afternoon following headlines regarding China deliveries (and CEO dance moves), with total volume closing in on 1M contracts and calls leading puts 5:3. 52% of today's volume is in weeklys that expire in two days, including 41K 500 strike calls which have traded from $3 to $9, avg $5.46. Largest trade is in the longer dated Jan21 term, where 1280 Jan21 380 puts traded for $39.50 tied to a delta hedge of 28K shares at $489. This $5M block of premium may close part of the 335/380 put spread that traded last week 4000x for $16.50 vs $429 stock. Notably, today's all-time high price for TSLA comes with unprecedented levels of bullish sentiment in the options, in the form of inverted put/call skewness. Currently 25 delta call ivol at the 30day term is above that of 25delta puts for only the second time since options were listed in 2015
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 15:27:28'] What changed to prompt the ridiculous jump in valuation? It feels like 90% hype.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 20:18:46'] You got to just love this stock, here the whole market is down today, I had just bought the 480 and the 555 call, and crazy enough, I hold them until late afternoon and end up making 2 Grand on just those 2 calls alone. The stock just won’t quit man, I thinkI’m up to about 30k on it in the past month with just buying random OTM calls on Monday and Tuesday. Nuckin Futz!
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 12:20:01'] Yea I think I posted something about this last night actually when someone talked about gamma exposure for ES.TSLA is a super abnormal stock relative to other single stocks for two reasons1. It's got a unique vol surface/skew that is very different than a lot of other equities (ex biotech)2. There is an abnormal amount of option volume relative to share volume, which is way different than the option volume: share volume of other stocksI believe TSLA is the hardest equity to trade in terms of being a pure options vol trader (ex delta).If you can trade TSLA in terms of vol, I believe you can trade almost any single stock well except for maybe biotechs, corporate action stocks since that's another category.  I'm just talking about vol here, not like you are just bullish TSLA and bought a ton of OTM calls.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 19:27:24'] Honestly was expecting the stock to hit 420 for the meme and then push up to 425 or 430 before tanking to 400, this non stop vertical climb is just crazy. Cant even buy puts cuz we might be looking at a situation like chipotle around this time last year, for all i know tesla will shoot too 6-700 by summer
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 12:33:46'] Another thing you can look at is how TSLA option trades affect the stock move.  Usually, it's the stock move that affects options pricing for almost anything (that's what delta is), but TSLA has this possibly unique feature where the options trades affects the underlying price, more so than other stocks.  None of us here are able to capture this opportunity since we aren't HFT, but I'm sure this is an HFT strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-08 12:28:36'] Yes- green line is the raw skew.  25d delta put IV minus 25delta call IV.  Chart is same if you use a normalized measure (divide by atm)

	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 07:34:41'] Can you ELI5 what put/call skew is? I've never encountered this term before.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 07:53:59'] I'm somewhat new to fundamentals. Is this graph showing calls becoming more valued than puts?
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 07:57:15'] Hi all- put/call skew is also the 'smile' or smirk discussed in options pricing- for most stocks, etfs, and indexes the out of the money puts trade at higher implied vol than out of the money calls to reflect the (actual or expected) higher risk of things crashing down than up.  Any consistent way to quantify it works- we use a 25delta put IV minus the 25delta call IV- that is what the green line shows on the image. So you can see that most of the past year in Tesla options the 25d put was about 8 points above the 25d call and when that became negative (put below call) it was very unusual! In this situation the calls are cheaper (in volatility terms and possibly price) than the puts and it means you can collar (hedge) the stock at a historically cheap cost.  Notably- this trade just printed today 1/9,  **5000 TSLA Aug20 300 Puts $12.173** (*FT Theo=11.31*)  Above Ask!  \[MULTI\] 10:45:12 **IV=58.2%** PHLX 63 x $11.35 - $11.75 x 83 PHLX  ISO - OPENING   52WeekHigh  Vega=$377k **TSLA=489.32** (Premium=$6.09m)  - suggesting someone might be look for Tsla to reverse course for at least a while.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 07:59:23'] What kind of a model do you run? Curious what you run for an ATM delta? More like ppr ~60% or a MM 50%. Also curious where vol currently sits, and break evens. I don’t really dabble in equity options, but I work in commodity options (wti brt ng) so just wanted to see how comparable the models run. Also do you clamp your teenies?Thanks! Debating getting into this space in my PA based on potential similarities in the modeling.
	COMMENT: ['2020-01-09 14:47:38'] Such great love/hate when it comes to Tesla!  Friends of mine that own them really do like them, no real question about the quality of the product, but valuation of the firm is whole other ballgame.  Stock pulled back $11 today after an early run back to 497- that put/call skew I was talking about is still inverted but not as much- puts steepened up a bit today and there was a big buyer of 5K Aug 300 puts- paid $12.17- that's $6M for a strike nearly $200 below spot.
	COMMENT: ['2020-05-11 21:15:05'] Hi OP, is there an update with this post? Stock is currently around $800.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 09:55:03'] It's not a strategy that I would do personally.  I think it's better to sell OTM strangles 2-3 months in the future and then buy them back when volatility dies down after earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 10:56:26'] I have bought straddles on meme stocks 2-3 weeks prior to earnings and did well from stupid options activity.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 10:21:52'] Why set the expiration so close to the event? You're maximizing theta decay by doing that. Nothing stopping you from using expirations that are 20 to 30 days after the event, apart from cost. But you are OTM anyway, so costs should be low enough.BTW, how OTM? You didn't state a delta entry target. In general, you want to select strikes whose delta is within the expected move of the event. Of course, *everyone* else in the market is doing the same thing, so the expected move is priced in and there won't be much leftover for profit. You're basically betting on a larger than expected move.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 07:41:38'] IV is thought to generally be lower post earnings in the majority of instances. However, IV could expand in some cases. Statistically, this trade would have a lower probability of success.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 09:35:42'] Use a short strangle for theta decay.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 08:53:52'] The only way your strangle would work is if there are what the market deems credible leaks released before the earnings.&nbsp;But generally most of these ones, short of an act of god situation will lose you money and you'd be lucky to break even because the IV will already inflated the days leading up.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 08:01:37'] If price doesn't move much before earning release. Even high IV may not save you from theta decay.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 11:12:06'] Countless times have seen the opposite done. Sell OTM strangles in hope that stock stays within range, and vol Crush... 2 days is a little tight.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 11:30:25'] If your trying defined risk. I’d do a long iron condors . Buy the calls and puts near price. This will help with the IV drop. Edit: typos fixed.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 14:16:32'] Mm this is basically the opposite of what you should do. Lol
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-30 19:54:13'] Too much risk for too little profit.Edit:  It’s not the straddle that kills this for me, it’s the short dte.  I do short straddles often, but 2-3 weeks out and the more stable the stock, the better.  The reasoning is the same; much less and there is too much risk for too little profit.  If you simply want to play an anticipated price fluctuation, you might consider a straddle and close a leg when the direction becomes evident.
	COMMENT: ['2023-01-31 06:45:54'] Yes this works. You’re going long Volatility when volatility usually increases. This is the main type of trade that I do except I scalp them intraday rather than holding overnight (added risk overnight that I like to avoid). I’m trading AMD and META today with their earnings coming up. I’ll come back after close and post areas where the IV increase overpowered theta decay. These are periods of time when both legs would have gained valueThe comments referring to holding through earnings aren’t relevant to this type of trade. It’s a completely type of trade

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 14:45:50'] If you buy them now, perhaps we’ll have a run up to battery day, which I would strongly consider locking profits at that point. If it’s not enough then take the coin flip and hope they bring some energy. Tesla is such a meme stock that it could actually jump a ton the next day for no reason. Wouldn’t hold beyond that

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 17:24:47'] I'm willing to bet TSLA goes up and down quite a lot between now and battery day. There may be some very nice spikes in the price, but beware of the influence of the rest of the market. If the market decides to take another dump of 2%, Tesla will get hit too.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 20:43:41'] I like the $680 call for $2.51, might buy a few contractsSmall enough investment I wouldn’t miss it if I was wrong, if we do get a runup into battery day I’ll 3x my investment through IV and delta at which point I’ll dump half my holdings before the event and ride the remaining for free through battery day.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-12 15:29:11'] If it were pre-split there would’ve been a good chance that it only goes up. But didn’t the recent big one-day drop spook you any? It seems like it could either way, and with the high premiums and big swings, it’ll most likely go to either direction quite fast. Do it if you have like a gambling portion in your portfolio only... and probably not prudent to go all in since that might not be enough time to recover if it doesn’t go your way.

POST_TEXT: b' Hi Community, Would love your thoughts on a really newbie questions.\n\nSay I have 100 Shares of TSLA at a cost basis of $600/share. Current price is $760.\n\nIf I sell a single covered call at a strike price of $950 for 16 Jul 21. That call is priced at $101. So I net, $10,100 at the time of the Sell. From there, one of three things can happen between now and 16 Jul 21.\n\n1. TSLA stock keeps going ballistic and goes through the strike price. Stock gets called away. In which case, I get to keep $10,100 (premium on call) + $95,000 (100 shares at $950). So a total profit of $45,100 ($60,000 cost and $95,000 + $10,100 profit).\n2. TSLA stock tanks massively in which case, i still hold the shares and take the loss on those, but collect the premium of $10,100 lowering my costs basis to $49,900.\n3. TSLA stock does nothing, scenario 2 above as the options expire and i still get to realize more profit due to lower cost basis.\n\nIs my thinking correct here. What am i missing and please tell me why I '
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 12:06:23'] 1/2/3 are correct. I don't, and cannot recommend trading TSLA though. It's a zeppelin full of bubbles.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 12:41:49'] Your analysis is correct.You could ask yourself if you correctly choosed the tradeoff between the call premium, the distance between the strike and the stock price, and the profit done by selling the shares at the strike.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 13:13:58'] Never bet against tesla
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 20:09:28'] The thinking is correct, and you can repeat this indefinitely, lowering your cost basis each time. It's a solid strategy if you have faith in the stock long-term.It's usually more profitable to sell monthly or even weekly calls - the cumulative premium is higher.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 20:38:19'] Correct, essentially you get some premium for additional regret in extreme scenarios.TSLA moons to 1500? You missed out on $50,000 and had to hold the stock for 6 months.TSLA crashes to 200? You missed $50,000 of your unrealized gains.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-06 22:11:38'] All 3 are correct. Its just that in the options world, July is really far away time. As you might know from option theory, option decay much faster when they are 30-45 days to Expiry. So instead of selling July call, you can the same thing with monthly Call and get little bit more premium if you do it for 6 times.

POST_TEXT: b'Happy New Years!\n\nI bought 2 contract options for TSLA dated 2/19 at 390 Strike Price the day before SP500 inclusion announcement.  About a month ago late Nov, I ended up shorting (sale) spread both underline contracts at 650C with same Expiry date and took about 5,300 in premium.  Based upon the Stock Options Calculator I have about 20K in Profit but my Max Profit is 25.1K.   I feel the stock can easily trade in the 600s, and where I would really lose my current gains is under 600 at 2/19.  The stock price is sitting at 705 today but hit ATH earlier this afternoon at 718.\n\n1. Should I stick it out, wait closer to 2/19, maybe goal to achieve around 23K gains.\n2. Should I hedge a 650/600 PUT spread (cost about 1700) - thinking it will be higher than 600 on 2/19\n3. Should I hedge with a lower PUT (no spread)\n4.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-31 21:13:52'] After considering and looking at the profit calculator, my stop loss will be TSLA at 650 or 8.4% drop of todays current price of 705.  I still lock in my 20K profits.  Right now the CSP value is at 10K, so any drop in TSLA will have the 650 CC lose considerable value.

	COMMENT: ['2020-02-05 05:45:51'] Why not set yourself up with a trailing stop on the option? This protects you from any downside while continuing to lock in profits. Set it and forget it! When I have a winner, I tend to set the trailing stop about 10% behind the last price of the option so it sells right away if it takes a downward turn. But if it keeps going up, that 10% (or fixed price in the case of options) goes with you. I think this is the safest route and will allow you to not stress out so much. This is a GREAT problem you have here!

POST_TEXT: b"Hmmm...\n\nTSLA is doing quite well today, and I'm debating on whether to take profits or let it ride. I currently have 10% trailing stops out on the options. Right now portfolio is up about 14% today (mostly from TSLA stock/call options). However, I suspect the price may go up significantly 4/15 or 4/16, my price target for that suggests more like 100% portfolio gain if they work out.\n\nSo I'm in a bit of a bind, do I take the 10%+ today (It's been varying between about 6% to 14%, currently rising) and perhaps lose out on 100%+ return, or do I wait and potentially lose the 10% gain (which is mostly from bought call options)."

Has anyone experimented with this? or a 3x fund it’s respective inverse.Wouldn't work, don't waste your time. You can do a much better job of inversing (or leveraging) yourself just with options. A short IC is inversed by a long IC, for example. But of course holding both at the same strikes would net to zero, or would be equivalent to a box spread.You never want to be "truly neutral" to all risks. If that's the goal, invest $0, easy-peasy. If you are trying to be specifically delta neutral, a short IC is already delta neutralish. It's good enough. If you want to neutralize more delta, you can pair a positive delta theta/vega play, like a leveraged short put, with shorting delta-weighted shares and rebalancing daily.https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ulvsck/theta_without_delta_intro_to_vol_trading/https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/v67zay/a_guide_to_csps/> On more volatile stocks such as TSLA I was considering **selling debit put spreads** or iron condors with premium collection around 1:3 the width of my spread.You can't *sell* a *debit spread*. If you sell to open a spread, that is a credit spread, by definition.Delta-neutralish structures like ICs shouldn't be used on stocks with high volatility, like TSLA. Exploit the high volatility, don't be victimized by it. You want to sell overpriced IV and cover with underpriced realized volatility, keeping the difference.> I would look to take money off the table at 30-50% max profit. If I was to reach 40% I may would set a stop loss for 30-35% max profit and see if I could approach the 50% mark.You can't one-size-fits-all profit targets across disparate structures. What's optimal for an IC may not be optimal for a credit spread. For example, a 50% **net** of max profit target for an IC can mean that one of the wings has lost all of it's credit, while the other is paying max. You don't want to get that deep into testing one wing or the other, so a more middling profit target, like 25% of max, lets you exit when the underlying price is closer to the midpoint and no wing is tested.Also, stop-losses only work on the most liquid and high volume trades. If your IC is only traded half a dozen times a day, there isn't enough price discovery for stop losses to be effective.https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/stop_loss/
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-08 14:08:57'] It sounds good regarding diversification and amount of invested capital at a given moment. Nevertheless, if you are using directional strategies or even Iron Condors better be prepared for some losses. From my experience, trading options with consistency will be easily achieved in Delta Neutral income strategies. Also, using indexes like SPX and RUT will avoid potential big price swings of individual stocks…I have developed some profitable strategies, like the “SPX / RUT Best Options Strategy”. This is my most profitable options strategy that delivers nice results: https://www.myoptionsedge.com/trading-account

POST_TEXT: b'TDLR: Bought TSLA calendar earlier this week and it all went south. Do I wait or roll out?\n\nFull story: This past week I bought a 750C calendar call spread. A couple days later when TSLA started falling, I bought the short leg back for a $9.14 profit, leaving me with the 5/21 call. The bloodshed this past week has left me discouraged  so I wanted to consider my actions going forward. \n\nGiven the profit from the short leg, my cost basis is now 46.73 bringing the expiration B/E to $797. Given my situation would it be preferable to keep the 5/21 call as it is and hope for enough of a rebound/IV expansion to break even and close? Or should I consider rolling out and up to allow more time for a recovery? Is the IV from the 4/28 earnings worth waiting for? \n\nMy current 5/21 750C is Delta 27, Theta -47, Vega 80\n\nfor the equivalent value, I could roll to the following:\n\n6/18 800C Delta 24.3 / Theta -35 / Vega 92.7\n\n7/16 860C Delta 22.8 / Theta -30 / Vega 103\n\n9/17 1040C Delta 18.5 / Theta -21.'

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-26 19:47:33'] I've been trading TSLA , like forever. It's a momo stock. Also, it got fronted when the boys on the street caught wind of inclusion.  Then they unwind that trade near the top. Weekly chart says $420 .. I also gave a target of $25 for Nio recently and got a lot of hate. I just chart them and be patient. Sometimes weekly charts are best to remove the noise.

Close position and buy later dated strike (or cheaper debit spread to reduce risk)It all depends on how much of your account is currently in the position. If it’s small, just let it ride (do NOT add). If it’s big position, you have to protect your capital and reduce your risk by closing.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 06:57:26'] Could be volatile next week… CPI next Tuesday, Vixperation on Wednesday, and OpEx on Friday.  You’ve already missed the near-term top in $TSLA and should sell your calls for profit on Monday.  Wait until 2/21 before reinvesting those profits.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 11:46:49'] If your goal is to convert these to owning stock at expiration, you will have negative theta leading up to that point.  That means the options will decay in value all the way until June.  You also don't want to exercise when there is still time value on the options since it is better to sell the call option and buy the stock at current price.  But if you want to hold until expiration and want to have positive theta, you can turn it into a butterfly with a bullish bias.  One example is to sell two 16 June 2023 280 Call for 10.00 and buy one 16 June 2023 300 Call for 7.00 for a credit of 14.00.  This will have a positive theta and you can hold until expiration without having theta risk. You will however still be exposed to delta as this trade has a positive delta so you will lose money if TSLA retraces from the recent highs but that is also the case with your original trade (original trade even has more delta risk).  You can play around with the short strikes based on where you think TSLA will by by June 2023.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 17:08:22'] I mean it has been knocking into some pretty strong resistance and hasn't been able to break through, I would sell at least a good chunk and book some of the very good profits you've acheived

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-11 09:56:39'] Next week could be volatile with CPI Tuesday, VIXperation Wednesday, and OpEx Friday.  Your timing with buying these options was excellent and you should 100% sell the calls and wait until 2/21 to allocate the profits.  It appears you’ve already missed $TSLA’s near-term top last week.  There’s like  .01% of the time where it makes sense to exercise call options and this is not one of them.

What are you going to do?Someone is going to buy 100 shares off you for 900/share.  Where are you going to get the 100 shares from?  You can use your long call, but that will cost you, as you alluded to, 1092 / share (you've already paid 292 for it).  You wouldn't want to pay 1092 to later sell to someone for 900.So what would you do?  Buy 100 shares on the open market?  If you do that you'll pay about 950/share.  Now you are buying at 950 to sell to someone for 900.&#x200B;So what you gonna do?

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-05 06:49:22'] I won't pull out a spreadsheet as I'm on my phone but: 29200/50 = 584. So that is about what you have to earn in preemium each week. If TSLA goes down, you might not be able to get enough preemium on your sold calls. So if tesla drops to 650 and stays there with low IV you would be unable to sell calls above 800 for enough money.Is my reasoning flawed?

What's the difference and how should these be interpreted? More specifically, why do different option expiries / strikes have different IVs? How does this relate to IV on the underlying? I know when IV is higher (relative to a given ticker), option premium is higher - ultimately how can I use the HV/IV on options and the IV Rank/Percentile on the underlying to evaluate this?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 18:33:30'] Importance of being right about market direction when trading optionsI trade stocks consistently for many years based on a mix of fundamental & technical analysis. But when I turned to options I became a loser again… I tell you my reasons I suspect this is happening: The risk reward ratio for options is not good as stocks. A vertical, for example, is 1, so I have to be right more than 50% of the time, like 70%, in order to make money, which is impossible to me (and probably everyone to do it consistently). So I started trading OTM butterflies, and the RRR is decent, but I have to be extremely right about market direction, which is not easy too. If I buy/sell ATM butterflies the reward is low and OTM it is hard to get the direction. So I started going long ATM Straddles when I guess IV is low, but the premiums are not cheap, and again I need prices to move well in my favor. At this point I think the options business is more like pure mathematics and game theory. I feel like market forecast doesn’t work for options and the math must prevail, like buying OTM butterflies (maybe broken wings to get some theta if the price don’t move), above and below the underlying and pay to see, like a poker hand. I know my thought process is probably very confused and I appreciate if someone can tell me a new line of thinking. Thank you, Yuri

I ordered "Options Volatility and Pricing" by Nathenberg. Its at parents place, so I am going to start reading it from January 2023. Question is: Is that enough to understand everything about options and most importantly will it teach how to trade volatility. I been reading a lot on volatility, but I am still not sure what to look for (IV, IV Rank, IV Percentile) and how much is "high IV" and how much is "low IV". Also read about "Volatility Smile" and volatility across different strikes and different expiration dates. I understand the concepts but I am lost on how to use them in a structured way. I am part of few discord groups (Free communities) and the answers are very general and vague like "You get it with experience", "Keep studying", "Stick with stocks"...2. For long term investing, I have a solid stock portfolio, except its not solid in 2022 lol.. but pays dividends and they are blue chip companies, so they will go back up within 30 years. No problem.3. I am interested in options trading (both day and swing trading). Additionally, last 2 years I have been developing an open-source algo framework (currently connects only to TD and IB). Link is below for anyone who wants to contribute/discuss. Still its work in progress! For day trading I want to use my algo and automate the trades.  [https://github.com/brahma-investment-group/big-algo-framework/tree/ib\_insync\_final](https://github.com/brahma-investment-group/big-algo-framework/tree/ib_insync_final)4. For swing trading, I have about 5K, and planning to do spreads (vertical, diagonal, calendar) and iron condors -- 45 to 60 DTE, Credit only. I read some posts here which suggested these. But again, I dont know when to use when and under what conditions.5. For day trading, I am assuming that doing spreads and iron condors would be a kill. My overall strategy for day trading would be momentum directional. I actually wrote a algo (using the above algo framework) to buy single PUTS/CALLS -- 1 OTM with minimum 2 DTE (So on fridays it would literally buy next weeks options). Again, for the algo I picked few stocks and indices (SPY/QQQ), but it wasnt taking into account IV or any greeks. Of course, I won some and lost some, but there isnt any consistencyLooking forward for any suggestions or to answer questions and have discussions!

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-28 19:53:43'] Any non-obvious pitfalls to selling ITM spreads?For example, I've noticed that I can take a stock with an established uptrend, and sell an ITM put spread pretty close to the price (so not ATM but just one or two strikes away), and get a risk:reward ratio better than 1:1. This works for expirations that are months away, so I have months for the trend to continue past my spread's strikes.It seems like a pretty simple trend trade with the benefit of defined risk, and the downsides of limited reward and potentially having to wait weeks or months to take profits.Anything I'm missing?

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 09:06:00'] When you make money on a leveraged derivative-based ETF like TQQQ or SQQQ, who is losing money?So for instance when trading plain shares, it's pretty easy to understand where profit is coming from. I.e. if Bob sells 10 shares of AAPL to Janett for $140 each, Bob gets $1400 from Janett.But where is the profit coming from for leveraged ETFs? I.e. if I gain 3x the return of the S&P, who is that money coming from?
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-29 12:51:02'] When someone refers to, for example, selling a put at 15-40 delta are they literally referring to the delta number available in the greeks? So as an example a SPY 11/30 $390 put shows a -0.191 delta at this moment, so would that would be in the 15-40 delta range and just be referred to as 19 (or 20) delta?I have a rough understanding of delta as it relates to an options pricing and the impact is has, but it confuses me to see delta often referred to as a whole number when discussing selling options while it's represented as a decimal in the greeks, so I worry I'm missing an entire component of delta unrelated to the greeks listed in a option's data.

I see the links that are provided and I’m for sure going to go through them as best as I can but I was hoping someone could point me in the direction to where I can become familiar with some terms I see being used frequently that I truly don’t understand because I don’t get the context, things like iron condor, legs, strangle, etc. Is there a glossary for these terms? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 07:38:50'] When placing a vertical spread order on TastyWorks, I noticed there was a commission of $2, and a fee of $1.54. Both of these number scale based on the number of contracts ordered. The $2 commission makes sense to me, since a spread consists of two legs. When signing up for TastyWorks, I was aware that I'd be paying $1 per contract opening, but where is the fee of $1.54 coming from? Is this something normal amongst other brokerages as well?

From what i've seen so far you want a strike thats lower, "i'm willing to buy if it gets down to $X.xx" idea yet, lots of put open interest at a higher than the current price. Seems... backwards and/or i'm missing something.

This means the maintenance req for naked puts/calls/etc needs to be less than or equal to 17169 otherwise I'll receive a margin call?Feel free to point me to a page / post if there is one that explains this clearly. I tried asking Schwab customer service today, got ping-ponged across several different departments and none of them could help answer my questions :(
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 07:54:52'] What is the reason it would be inadvisable to trade a leveraged ETF? I am looking at HNU, the premiums seem good, Natural gas outlook is good over a long of enough time period that I would be content wheeling. Seems the biggest red flag, personally, and from what I've read, is that I'd be chasing premium and capping upside pretty consistently.  editAnother question: To exit a covered call that goes ITM, do I simply buy to close, and then sell the underlying to collect the equivalent credit and portion of upside? or do I have to wait for expiry? Seems the issue is that I could wind up losing out on profit due to the nature of only being able to execute one transaction at a time and the LETF is volatile.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 12:00:26'] Hi, I work nights and would like to trade options. Downside of working nights is sleeping the majority of time the markets open. I find I make the right plays but am asleep when market makes moves and by the time I wake whatever movement went my was has reversed and lost all possible profit… Question: Is it possible to place a limit order and a stop loss on the same contract? So if value goes high enough it triggers a sell and if it goes lower than I’d like would trigger a sell. I’m aware of volatility and the possibility of not filling but I’m wondering if setting these parameters are possible.It doesn’t appear it’s possible on Robinhood it will only let me place one sell order per contract, do other brokers allow this? Or does robinhood allow this and I’m doing it wrong? Thanks
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 12:12:16'] Why do SPX options move so much more powerfully than SPY options?  Both track similar instruments (although one is an index and one is an ETF). But they are both tracking the SP 500. SPX calls seem to move about twice as powerfully as SPY options.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 12:31:19'] Are new options created if I sell covered calls? Is the "option float" made larger when doing so?For stocks, shares outstanding and the float is set by individual companies listed on exchanges. However, is the number of "options outstanding/options float" determined in advance? Is this always set in stone by the CBOE in advance for weekly's and other options, etc.? Or, does the act of "selling covered calls" actually create a new option that otherwise didn't exist?  My guess is that selling covered calls is the same as shorting a stock. And just like shorting stocks can increase the amount of shares floating around and even lead to more than 100% of available shares being shorted (as was the case with GME), the same is true for options. Selling covered calls --> shorting the option market --> selling an option you don't have --> increases the "options outstanding/float" number.  Is that correct?

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-02 19:22:12'] Hey guys, need an ELI5 for this one…I bought $13c and $11.5p 12/16’s for Chargepoint earnings at about 10 min to close on Thursday when the price was approx $12.25. The IV for both was around 104%. I was anticipating a 10%+ move post-earnings for me to yield positive gains. An equal amount was invested each side.20 min after open the price had slid to $11.33, -7.8% from when I bought my strangle.At that point my calls were decimated, down like 73%+. My puts on the other hand we’re only + 4-6% and minutes later went negative with the calls. IV dropped to around 65%I understand the concept of IV crush and fully anticipated the call side losses to eclipse the put side in this example; but the put side near-zero gains then loss had me scratching my head. Essentially a -8% move was not enough to yield gains on an ITM put.All I could think about was the people that bought individual puts, punching the air. Almost a $1 move on a $12 stock and they made peanuts, then lost money.Any insight? I was under the impression that volatility was the goal for a straddle. At least I was savvy enough to dump the puts and added calls, but I think I’m still down like 35% right now on the total move. Stock hit $11.77 AHThanks 🤙🏽
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 07:05:13'] Hi, I have never traded options, but successfully traded stocks. From time to time I think about trading options. But what always stops me from doing it is the fact that options spread is way larger than stocks spread. Plus it looks like there's less liquidity. For example, some S&P constituents options have less than 1000 (with strike price near the current stock price) volume a day. Based on this fact i cannot understand how you guys trade options. Because of the large spread you lose a lot of money, and it is veeery hard to find an edge that can justify the costs. Is there something that i don't understand? Can anyone explain me how people make money with options?
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-03 09:37:52'] I'm looking at a strategy where I would be using a combination of iron condors and double calendar spreads.  One key to success in this strategy is having a stop loss that could execute across the entire position.  Is there any option broker out there that would let you have a stop loss on an 8 legged option strategy like this?  I don't want to have to be sitting by the computer screen all day managing the position and would like to find out a way to automate it if at all possible.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 14:01:20'] Wash sale question, just want to be absolutely sure: Let's say there's a ticker (SPY) traded consistently all year - generating large losses early on, and actively trading such that any subsequent losses were within the 31-day timer, and therefore are logged by the broker as wash sales. Provided that I closed out any remaining SPY positions earlier today (Nov 30th), and provided that I *do not touch the SPY ticker in any way shape or form through the year end* then ALL losses will become realized for this tax year, such that realized capital gains/losses would be from the NET P/L? To use an example to illustrate: say in January I lost $10k trading SPY options. Assume I continued trading SPY afterwards such that I made a $1000 one week, and $1000 loss the next, over and over again.  Across 10 months (feb-nov) the $1000 weekly gains would result in gains of $20,000, and the loss weeks would result in a losses of $20,000, but these would be subject to wash sale and cannot offset the gains (yet). My understanding is as of TODAY, all the $10k january losses + the $20k losses accrued through the year are wash sale disallowed: therefore short-term taxes as of this moment would be owed on $20k. However if all positions were closed out today and not touched again until on or after Jan 1st, then ALL losses this year will become REALIZED: the result is $20k gains - ($20k losses from rest of year) - ($10k january loss) for a net short-term capital loss of $10k, realized and claimable for the tax year 2022.Is that understanding correct?
