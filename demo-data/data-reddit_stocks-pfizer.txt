POST_TEXT: b'I noticed Pfizer stock is at a 1 year low this morning. Figured it is a stock that as the COVID pandemic begins to go away more that we will just see it go down. Then realized it is Pfizer that will possibly buy up another company Seagen ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/pfizer-merck-seagen-pharma-stock-price-c7161fc2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pfizer-merck-seagen-pharma-stock-price-c7161fc2)). Looked around some more and after all things considered it appears Pfizer is a buy. Many analysts say buy ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d)). I also say buy. \n\nWhy is Pfizer down though? Could it slide another 20%?'
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 08:58:21'] What’s their pipeline look like? If the Covid vaccine is their magnus opus, then I wouldn’t touch it for awhile.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:23:38'] I am more of a BMY kind of guy
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 18:28:10'] Bought more today. It was a stagnant firm but the management now knows what they’re doing. They hit on the vaccine and the most effective antiviral for COVID. Pipeline is okay but getting better. Throw in a nice dividend yield and a worst case forward PE of ~21 in a few years, the risk profile feels right. Disclosure: Long PFE, BMY, MRK
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 12:56:11'] They are expected to buy Seagen? A biotech. It is costly so PFE will go down initially. It’s for long term
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:29:27'] I'm going to hold onto my shares and wait it out. At least the 4% dividend helps.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 09:12:40'] I hope so! I just sold my first put ever in my Roth on PFE $42.50 strike price expiring 3/17. I'm usually pretty conservative in my Roth because I don't want to take a chance on losing money I've already paid taxes on, but I decided to take a little risk this morning. From all of my research, I see their problems with innovation, but I also see that the market looks too pessimistic about them right now.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 19:22:12'] WSJ article by Hopkins and Seal says the expectation for Pfizer is $70 bil in sales vs last year's amazing $100 bil.  As people are saying in this discussion, the come down from COVID is the main reason.  Also I don't see another article now but a number of major drug companies are having important patents expire and generics are ready to take over in these niches.  That effected Pfizer too.  So there is a retreat ahead of that longer term problem.Still, I bought a small PFE position Friday as an opening salvo.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:51:55'] Well, you can buy Pfizer and keep it just in case we have another pandemic. Today's HHS secretary is tommorow's Pfizer  board member.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 10:07:59'] I am curious too, what is causing the Pfizer stock to be at a 52 weeks low ?

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 20:30:50'] Idk about Pfizer but the pharma company I work at and specifically the division I work in was up 12% yoy on most products. Profit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 04:57:36'] Their most recent 10k which is from 2021 mentions that their balance sheet is consolidated. More specifically "Our consolidated balance sheet contains significant amounts of intangible assets, including IPR&D and goodwill. For IPR&D assets, the risk of  failure is significant, and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will yield successful products." Plus they mention that they were potentially going to take on debt due to business development which could affect their credit rating.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-28 05:42:28'] No
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-01 00:54:24'] I prefer AZN over PFE but they're both good companies.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-02 12:26:29'] Looking at PFE's historical financials (here: [https://jmp.sh/ZX2tYbSy](https://jmp.sh/ZX2tYbSy)) I would say that current Price/Sales is slightly below the long-term median, PE is actually below it's long-term median, rev, gross profit and operating income have been skyrocketing since the pandemic (e.g. why PE is lower than the median), net income and free cash flow have also been skyrocketing. Bottom line: the valuation chart (top left) shows that the stock is below the mid range of fair value. However, earnings have been skyrocketing only over the last 2-3 years. Historically revenue, gross profit and operating income as well as net income has been either very volatile and pretty much flat since 2002-2005. I would argue that it's not cheap enough at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-27 18:50:51'] I like it; it's like the exact same company as in 2018 but went from $40B to 0 debt basically. For some reason the market penalizes it for having had a Covid windfall; yeah the comparables won't look great, but that's a plus not a negative at today's near pre-Covid prices.The only thing is I don't think Pfizer is going to prioritize the shareholder with its cash. Their management makes clear they want to acquire companies, which while good for future growth is bad for someone looking for share buybacks/dividends. The best bull case is a very anti-trust inclined federal government. Still, probably a decent boring investment to hold. Not sure if will outperform SPY though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-09 08:20:41'] Great journalism, but what now? What power does the public have to prevent this blatant corruption? Most of these officials aren’t elected. The only hope would be for the public to demand its elected  officials implement a law that no households who have any members who work for the US government are allowed to own anything but personal assets (house, cars, etc.) and US treasuries for life. I can’t imagine what kind of unintended consequences would result from a blanket ban for life or even just while the individual is working for the government. The problem is there’s no good solution. We clearly can’t rely on the integrity of these officials to do the right thing and the only solutions will be too extreme (not to mention highly unlikely to ever get implemented).

Even on the high end that averages 10k measly dollars, lower end 2k, per employeeThey fluffed it up by giving total dollars which sounds bad but I want to see a breakdown of averages. This isn't Pelosi level insider trading. While it should be stopped I'm not sure it needs to be punished as it's such large scale and seemingly average people just trying to get a leg up in life.I'm willing to bet more than half of us would try this knowing it's unlikely to get caught if it's not a huge amount.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-14 09:26:25'] If governments implement some kind of fast track, I think this pill could be effective. For example, if an at-risk person has a positive Covid test. The at-risk person would receive the pills straightway without having to see their doctor or going to the pharmacy. In that case, I believe it could be a game-changer. However, without a fast-track, the delay between a positive test and the prescription could be too great...

Not like any of the off-label repurposed meds like Fluvoxamine where we only have some evidence just by chance and no real idea about the mechanism. Certainly nothing like Ivermectin and other BS. Paxlovid is for real. From a financial perspective though, OP is spot on- it means more about the course of the pandemic in general than it does for PFE as a company. I believe they've already agreed to allow other companies to manufacture it. You don't make boatloads of money off an acute treatment, even if millions of people will need it.

I would dig around on the internet and find out which company is doing research on that particular drug and invest in it. I’m currently on Mounjaro. It is nothing short of a miracle drug. If you want more information on when it is likely to be approved for weight loss, hop on over to the subreddit. There are doctors and researchers who occasionally weigh-in (haha, bad pun, I know) with the information they have been given. Some say the end of summer, some say by the end of the year. My guess would be winter through early spring. Also, check out the lengths users are willing to go through to stay on the medication. This should tell you all you need to know. Ozempic has nowhere near the same fan base.

POST_TEXT: b'Most of the big market moves for the last several years can be examined in hindsight, and you can see they were pretty obviously telegraphed.  \n\nExamples... Nvidia low $100\'s when AI hype was just starting to build.  Netflix $160 when hype about their ad tier pivot commenced.  Treasuries, early 2022 on furious rate hike demand/spec.  Energy, on Russia\'s launching another terrorist invasion campaign.  Cryp+o demise.  Banks, late 2022 on panic in European and other outlier institutions. FB first admitting metaverse was silly and backburnering it. \n\nI\'m guilty of sometimes looking at these early narratives and finding them perhaps too obvious, and then being too cautious or contrarian. \n\nSo what is your current narrative that we\'ll be looking back at, that sector or stock that\'s about to do 80% over 6 months and we\'ll be slapping ourselves saying "of course we should have seen that, it was obvious"'

The war with Ukraine has expedited the need for a transition to self sustaining energy. Now the only thing about this is do you want to start building a position now (I'd argue fairly risky as its a fairly new sector to go mainstream so alot of these companies might not make it through the coming recession), or do you wait out the coming recession and then start investing. Me personally I'm going to wait for it to start hitting the fan and this is one of the first sectors I'll be DCA'ing into.

I think Iridium is kinda dead)* Crypto run up, part 6. BTC tends to go in and out of the news cycle which leads to the price going up and down as people gain and lose interest in it. It's been slow lately, so probably due for another run up in a year or so. That should coincide with the expected price spike from the next havening, so I think it's still worth a look.* Tesla devaluation. The stans will hate me for this, but they are rapidly losing their edge (and Elon's attention). Ford Mach E is on par with the model Y. Rivian, Ford and GM all beat them to the punch on a truck. Cybertruck is years behind. The semi is finally coming out in beta. Build quality hasn't improved. The only positive I see is their profit margin which will rapidly evaporate as they keep losing their first mover advantage.* Zombie company fallout. Lots of large, legacy S&P companies valued way higher than they should be, well over a reasonable P/E. Specifically tech companies.* Quantum computing will be here shortly too. Once people figure it out, it will break computing and AI as we know it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-23 20:12:32'] I would look real estate ADJACENT. It'd be worth it to see which companies are expanding and buying commercial real estate, as any expansion COULD be seen as a sign of growth, or at the very least, a bubble period. If the company continues to do well, you'll see an increase in revenue, which can only be good for investors. If not, you can still hold out maybe an 8 month bubble? I mean, the rising stock price could last longer than that, but usually a company will know within its first year of expansion whether or not that was a sustainable cost, indicative of employee number growth, and the ability to still meet quarterly fiscal goals and market predictions.I'd pay close attention to metropolitan real estate, especially. It's a little easier to read about and stay updated on when any expansion like that will be having job openings published in their local news papers, and it's just easier to research that way, as there's just MORE business in metropolitan areas. So, condense your search down to one area that you can track thoroughly and frequently, and I think you have the best chance at finding the stocks that are right for you, instead of trying to follow market trends and analyses.You can take a look at the data, or you can just look around you. Both are still prediction.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi everyone. Please forgive me if this question is simple but why is a share of Moderna or Biontech so much more expensive compared to their counterpart Pfizer? Biontech has a P/E of 64, Moderna has a P/E of 51 and Pfizer has a P/E of 19 so that explains the price differences on the surface but if like to understand why. Are Biontech and Moderna overvalued or Pfizer undervalued? Is there expectations for growth for the two companies but not Pfizer? I guess I'm looking for help in understanding the differences in the P/E in order to understand the stark differences in price. Thanks guys!\n\n\n\nEdit: thanks for all the helpful answers and for staying on topic and not making me feel stupid! Also thanks to everyone awarding post."
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:24:35'] P/E ratios are based on the past 4 quarters, but both Moderna and BioNTech earnings will skyrocket in the most recent quarter . If you look at Moderna's most recent quarter for example it was $6.46 EPS, much higher than previous quarters. If you annualize that, the P/E ratio is actually less than 20.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 22:28:25'] Moderna and BioNTech have patented breakthroughs technology (mRNA delivery used for COViD for vaccines) that could have applications for nearly any condition. Their pipelines include vaccines for cancers, malaria, sickle cell anemia. Moderna is in trials for a flu vaccine that covers all four strains. That alone would be a market worth tens of billions of dollars per year. There are 60M flu vaccines given in US every year in large until now bc the vaccine often doesn’t work well or work at all bc their are 4 flu strains the they have to guess which strain to make the vaccine for each year. Drug discovery is traditionally very complicated and very expensive. Huge pharmaceutical companies can go years producing large market drugs which make them billions in profits but they go off patent in a fixed time (how long in the market depends on how long the development process took bc they patent the compound at discovery and then go about testing and developing it which can take years). The huge difference with Moderna and BioNTech is that the delivery system is always the same. They just have to figure out the mRNA target protein or antibody. So they don’t have to create a new compound every time. I don’t think this last part is actually priced into the stock, but it is secondarily bc it allows the companies to find and produce new applications and target new conditions and diseases very quickly vs traditional drug development. As an example, Moderna had their vaccine ready 3 weeks after the DNA sequence of COVID was released! The rest of the time was just the FDA trials. The previous record time for a vaccine to be developed was 4 years!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:16:04'] Pfizer has a higher market cap than both of them though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:10:27'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:18:06'] Pfizer is already a massive company bigger than those two. The vaccine is only a part of their revenue they make so much other stuff
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:46:06'] Price doesn’t mean what you think it means. But PFE should definitely have a higher P/E.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 20:46:50'] Moderna and Biontech have the IP, Pfizer just manufactures bntx’s vaccine and distributes it. Mrna and bntx have a big pipeline of IP.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:36:38'] Pfizer has a huge market cap. They are not a pure-play on the vaccine unlike moderna or biontech.Revenues and profits from the vaccine will make a smaller percentage of profits for Pfizer.....while profits from the vaccine will be a far higher percentage of total profits for moderna/biontech. In fact, the vaccine is moderna's only product that brings in profit.Pfizer has tons of product.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 20:46:09'] Pfizer, in the long term, has for me been a damn good investment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:12:04'] The value of the underlying technology platform carries a higher relative value for BNTX and MRNA. Both of those are early stage, high growth biotech companies, so they're not really valued based on sales, the sales are just a great plus. Both of those companies are more mRNA therapeutics plays, including for cancer treatment and infectious disease vaccines. For Pfizer, being a mature pharma, theyre valued based on their profitability. Theres also relative market caps. If the value of the mRNA vaccine for each other them is like $5B, that will only drive a small rise in Pfizer stock, while MRNA and BNTX skyrocketed.TLDR. Pfizer is a mature company, valued on present day income, MRNA and BNTX are speculative biotechs valued based on future earnings potential, they would even be valued using earnings if not for the COVID vaccines
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 22:01:07'] Moderna is WAY inflated imo. Biontech as well. Now, I'm not saying this cause I'm bitter I sold my Moderna that I bought at $20 post-covid crash for $75 a few months later and didn't hold it till now, no, no, no... well, I kinda am, but the point is as others have said, who knows what Moderna is gonna do after covid but for the time being, they're riding HIGH on covid 'hype'. So buying now could be good, it could be bad. I wouldn't take that gamble now though.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 11:14:09'] So wishing I'd have put the amount of money I put into Pfizer into Moderna.... I'm looking at 19% returns for Pfizer and.... 483% returns for Moderna.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:51:51'] To add to what others have said about Market cap, it also has a lot to do with their share “float”. Pfizer is a century+ old company that has issued 5.5 billion shares. Moderna is an 11 year old company with 350 million shares in existence. Essentially you would need a much higher trading volume day for PFE to have significant movement than you would for MRNA, because prices really go up when there are fewer shares floating around and there is intense demand for those shares.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 19:11:14'] Moderna has a bunch of new mrna drugs/possible cures coming in the near future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 20:00:35'] Pfizer gives dividends which generally suppresses value growth.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 23:08:01'] Pfizer is mature and established, and you're not alone in wondering if it's a little undervalued right now.  Moderna was practically a startup with a concept prior to COVID, but they went all with their RNA concept and COVID as their proof of concept.  The valuation reflects a speculation that moderna's approach could be useful for other diseases.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:49:22'] Please tell me you realize that stock price is not equivalent of company value....
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:55:59'] Market cap = total value of all stock = (total number of shares) x (price per share)Not all companies have the same number of shares, so you can’t compare the price per share. But you can compare their market caps.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:51:30'] Because Moderna and biontech make the vaccine. Pfizer just distributes biontech vaccine
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 22:25:24'] Pfizer doesn't have the same growth potential, it's already a giant broad-based pharmaceutical corp.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 23:49:14'] BioNTech revenue rocketed from 61.5 M in 2017 to 482 M in 2020, while Pfizer's revenue relatively flat for years even tumbled in 2020. This explains a lot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 05:43:35'] Compare their forward P/E, the grouping is alot closer. Meaning people are expecting earnings to increase 2-3x to their current price for Moderna and Biontech.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 05:53:26'] Forward P/E on MRNA and BNTX are actually around 10, almost half that of Pfizer. Looking at historical P/E on those companies is incredibly silly.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 07:08:41'] Moderna use to be 27 dollars.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 10:46:48'] P/E is just one aspect influencing the price, even expected P/E ratio for the next one or two years. There are many new companies that will not make any profit for many years to come in order to grow their business valued at millions of dollars. The global mRNA vaccine and therapeutic market is estimated at almost 30 bill $ with a average 37% growth over the next 5 years. Moderna and Biontech having a dominant market positions. So the growth of the market for rMRA is much faster than the one of conventional drugs Pfizer is operating in. ( estimated 11.4% over the next 5 years) Their part in COVID vaccines is only production and distribution. Maybe this explains the different valuations for these companies.https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/11/2245707/28124/en/Global-mRNA-Vaccine-and-Therapeutics-Market-2021-to-2030-by-Product-End-user-and-Region.html„The global pharmaceutical manufacturing market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 11.34% from 2021 to 2028 to reach USD 957.59 billion by 2028.“
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 11:59:42'] Pfizer is a old, established company that just does what it does. Less speculation with a known quantity .
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 12:07:19'] I would’ve bet my life that Pfizer’s Poison Everyone ratio was higher than the other 2.  This ratio is too low for such a deadly pharma company.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:25:46'] Pfizer has other businesses like selling Emergen-C and stuff that aren't as valuable
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:52:57'] Pure plays vs portfolio….you hit big with one product and u moon
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 20:24:20'] Hype
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 00:39:34'] The forward p/e of moderna is only 22.73. Their current high p/e is from two unprofitable quarters.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 01:14:06'] Greedy
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 04:44:54'] it is a goldmine if covid continues to exxisit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 05:22:04'] $PFE gonna pay my rent!  🤠
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 05:54:41'] The carnage this question has caused
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 07:14:35'] Maybe Pfizer has issued way more shares in the past than the other two. I haven’t looked into it if someone else wants to confirm. But seems likely the share structure could be different
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 08:44:42'] Modena seems too speculative to me, their vaccine is not competitively priced outside of the USA compared to the others available . Other pharmaceuticals are hot on their heels with MRNA based vaccines. I don't see their cashflow as sustained, once the USA is fully vaccinated it will drop drastically.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:53:29'] Sold all my Pfizer today, gone!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 17:58:58'] Moderna has a forward PE of 12-15
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:19:45'] Moderna has a great pipeline of medications in development, as well. I'm particularly interested in the personalized cancer vaccine.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:30:33'] Another way to see why there’s a big price difference is the outstanding shares , Pfizer have 5 BILLION outstanding shares compared to Moderna with less than 500Million..remember, the supplies and demand  theory.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:58:07'] Look at market cap. The vaccine is a really small part of pfizer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:40:01'] $PFE it’s time to go to 50
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 21:05:55'] PFEis actually higher than MRNA or BNTX based on their market cap. PFE is 250b; MRNA is 167b and BNTX is 94b. Plus PFE has a 4% dividend.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 06:25:57'] Because Pfizer holds the world record for largest medical care fraud and largest criminal fine of any kind. They deserve worse than a lower stock rate.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 17:01:34'] You have 3 fruits. These fruits are traded on a fruit exchange.A banana is worth $1,000,000An apple is worth $500,000An orange is worth $100,000The smart fruit funds know people can not afford $100,000 to $1m for one fruit. So they break these fruits into pieces, AKA shares. Each fruit is turned into 100,000 shares.You can now buy into the banana market for $10/share, the apple market for $5/share, and the orange market for $1/share.They're all fruits, yet priced differently. Why? Because they each have a different market value (market capitalization).
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 23:32:53'] It's simple. Both are over valued at the moment.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 10:19:04'] They’re my best performers for today!I think you have to take into account Pfizer is a huge company already; these vaccines are a small percentage if their overall business. For MRNA it is a big percentage. So their percent increase is bigger.I know youre asking about the price, but that’s my take on the imprtant differences.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 18:31:52'] These will crash so hard just wait.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 00:32:06'] Moderna and Biontech are the „Tesla“ of Pharma. Their mRNA technology has proven to work on COVID and now they are expected to produce other medicine for Malaria or Cancer. To develop those could take a long time and to generate profit from them even longer. But the COVID vaccine has shown that they are capable to produce a highly effective product generating profits with their new approach. The stock market is trading the hopes in the possible future of mRNA companies and the P/E ratios reflect that. If you ask what car manufacturers are the better buy and compare the P/E ratio of Tesla with the one of Toyota or Volkswagen you come to the same conclusion than with these Pharma stocks. Comparing their stock performance of the last month and years can give an indication where Moderna and Biontech could go and on the other hand how much patience you might need with a Pfizer investment. IMO
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:28:15'] Biontech is the next Pfizer... ;)
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 22:31:18'] Pfizer has a Partnership with BioNTech. Moderna has their own vaccine entirely. Very different.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 06:12:41'] Pfizer is a massive diversified big pharma company. The vaccines no doubt will help their net income as much as it would for moderna or novavax.To prove this Pfizers Net income in 2019 was 16.2 B, it's net income for the second quarter of 2021 us about 5.6B annualized this is about 22B. So about a 30% increase+ 3.5% dividend makes sense.Moderna, although not really showing a profit, probably largely due to massive RD spending, made about 1.93 B in revenue in the second quarter of 2021. In 2019 they made a net total of 6 Million in revenue. So going from nearly $0 in revenue to 6B in 2021 would have a major effect.Just to reiterate, although the vaccine has a positive effect on revenue for Pfizer, because Pfizer is so book and has so many different medical products even a product that that generates a lot of revenue may not end up actually having much of an effect on the stock Price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-08 16:31:07'] Moderna is a very new bio tech company with not a lot of pipeline. But they could have a massive pipeline of products that gives them a comparable moat to PFE. Personally it’s a bit much for me and the liabilities that bio tech faces.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-20 12:55:25'] Its market cap and shares out standing Pfizer issued billions of shares

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 12:14:08'] Pfizer had the globe as a customer before the COVID vaccine. They are a huge drug company. They spent a ton on research to develop the COVID vaccine and probably won't see much profit from it.You really need to look at the whole company and how they operate to figure out if some new thing is going to be wildly profitable or not.Also remember that the vaccine is just two shots. Once people get them, they're done. Compare that to their other cash cows, like Viagra, where people pay a bunch of money for pills they take every week for years and years.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 00:51:34'] NIO has a market cap 2x that of Ford. I don't try to understand the stock market anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 12:24:06'] Tesla is doing to the car what Apple did to the phone. They're not just a car company, and people believe in this vision, that's why it's trading so high. This vaccine? Takes a lot of capital to develop and ship, but has limited potential and growth. Very two dimensional compared to something like tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:44:01'] Easy way to solve this is Pfizer changes name to Pfizer EV or Pfizer Blockchain. It'll be a EV SPAC where they announce they will partner with NIO or Xpeng and then go by $PHEV after the merger. It'll be up 7000%.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 13:49:29'] Nobody really understands it to be fair, even those that pretend they do.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 11:28:51'] Stocks are priced on long term value, too.No vaccine money once everyone is vaccinated!Plus Tesla are more than cars..
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 18:24:29'] Save yourself a headache, don't apply logic to Jerome's casino. Markets right now are mostly a function of manipulation by big clearing houses, central banks and notional option value (gamma vanna etc.)They don't work on logic, suck down trillions per year of currency slowing velocity and serve to siphon money from lower classes to bail out the rich's stocks when they drawdown. Specifically, Tesla is where it's at because of options manipulation, and an uneducated investor climate. It's inclusion into the S&P might be the thing to finally kill this thing though, so here's to hoping.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 13:58:51'] Vaccines can't be priced to profit. At least not heavily. Elon can sell a software upgrade for $6000. Also after covid, Tesla will continue to innovate while Pfizer will go back to being a generic big pharma corporation
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 14:45:09'] I am a pharmacist and I would never invest in pharma. Their stocks just don’t go where you expect them to go and you have a very tiny window to make something of it. Vaccines are not expensive.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:00:28'] In my 30 years of investing I’ve learned a lot, but in the last five years of investing I’ve learned that things are different now.  It’s not about profits... or EPS, P/E, float or anything else at this point... It’s the fact that there is no alternative to making money in the stock market; savings accounts are useless, CDs are useless, treasury, bonds, all are a way to lose to inflation at this point with the exception of the stock market.  Given that there is no alternative and metrics are useless at this point it is all psychology. Let me repeat for those in the cheap seats... IT’S ALL PSYCHOLOGY AT THIS POINT.  I’ve held Pfizer for four years and it hasn’t moved a fucking inch... good dividend but no upward momentum.  My dad said it best recently, if you wanna make your pile be in the style.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 16:05:12'] Tesla is the most overvalued big cap I’ve seen in a long time. This market is about as crazy as I’ve ever seen it (been trading for 10 years). I don’t think this ends well.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 23:47:40'] Because Musk is a meme lord and new generation investors go based on hype stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 11:29:32'] The market is forward-looking.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 14:46:18'] Why are you applying logic to the stock market?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 15:04:38'] Let's not forget that governments prepaid for a large number of vaccines. Nothing that has happened in the last few months is new news. Also, did you really think you would get rich buying Pfizer when the whole world knew vaccines were in production? Seriously. Not sure what the thought process is. If you bought anytime in the last 12 months, you are in the green. If you bought after FDA approval, you were so late to the game that you might as well just go home. Pfizer is a traditional buy and hold until retirement stock. Not some meme.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 18:02:00'] Ironic this was posted as I acquired about 580 shares of PFE 4 months ago. Sold off about 1/4 of it and bought  TSLA at the split in September.  I'm no expert investor by any means but my PFE has been pretty flat and I'm up about 25% in TSLA.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:46:26'] One is priced correctly.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 07:17:22'] You know how everyone was buying and hoarding anything that looked like toilet paper? That’s like people buying Tesla.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 15:10:58'] 1 - they aren't the only vaccine in town2 - other vaccine is better, easier to store3 - everyone will be on their ass if they don't keep the price low, pricing power takes a hit 4 - vaccine prices always drop anywayprobably other reasons too.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 11:30:34'] Growth and potential is the answer.Tesla is growing at a much faster rate and plus they have a ton more potential than Pfizer. The EV industry in general has a ton of potential/growth.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 14:40:16'] It's partly because they admitted to doing the vaccine and pricing it to only break even. It is also because they did go up. You see they had a stock gift recently where shareholders of pfizer recieved a stock named Viatris. For every share of pfizer they recieved ~0.124079 share of viatris. This lowered the share price of pfizer, but then the price ran back to its previous price.so it actually has been gaining in value. Overall I think pfizer is a beautiful stock. Ethical German pharmaceutical doing covid for non profit. There revenue and rlearning s are green. Not crazy ceo bonuses. It should be made a meme imo.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 14:37:38'] Besides: There ist no moat. When covid came up, everyone developed a vaccine. Thats like "When the ev came up, everyone developed ev". Yeah, thats not what happened. As a German from the car region ist still puzzles me how much our giants missed.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 17:30:21'] The stock market works the same way as celebrities. Have you wondered why the Kardashians are so popular? Tesla is the Kardashian of the Wall Street.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 18:13:38'] I would think that the profit margin on a vaccine would be much higher too
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:24:59'] Go check out Moderna.. up 600% since early 2020
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:27:23'] Because stocks doing go up based on their contribution to society. They go up based on the prospect of increasing earnings.The market believes Tesla’s earnings are going to grow way more than Pfizer’s. Pfizer has been around forever and they don’t have as much share to grow in their field as Tesla does. Tesla is 2% of auto share in the US, far less globally. They have a lot of room to grow and the market some how thinks they’ll pull it off.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:20:27'] Pretty sure they are selling the covid vaccine at cost or near loss, not a big profit maker
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:49:57'] LOL that’s okay nobody really understands how the  stock market works
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 22:43:53'] Because short squeezes, and gamma squeezes caused by people buying calls.May end soon now that TSLA is part of SP500
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 23:39:02'] Because a large portion of the US (at least) has doubts about the pandemic and whether COVID is actually "real" or just a flu.  A decent portion of the other half has fear about the vaccine and how it was produced so quickly. The topic is toxic and the way news is distributed, neither side of the spectrum is trusting of what needs to be done by Pfizer or others.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 07:06:41'] It is simple: tesla is over priced.They work in a business with paper thin margins at volume, so unless everyone is going to buy a 100k tesla, they won't make enough profit to justify the stock price. In theory having no user serviceability give their dealership mechanics some potential profit but if the cost of ownership is too high then their mass market vehicle sales will die.So uhh, yeah it is all just because hype but hype can go on forever so it doesn't mean their stock price will go down. Just nobody would buy the company for 500 billion or whatever their market cap is these days. People buy the stock because the stock will go up not because they want to own tesla.This is my opinion, tesla stock owners don't downvote me pls
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 07:17:24'] For people who tell that we need to check the numbers you need to learn one thing. The stock is news driven. When you think about EV you think about Tesla. The CEO is well known, and they are growing as a firm. They have a good PR.  For Pfizer, people don't like the big Pharma, don't really like vaccines. Saying it's a bubble? It's a bubble only if it pops. Everything can be considered a bubble because in the stock market it's just a perceived value, not a real one. Why is a bubble when the market cap is 30X the revenue but at 15X is not? It's sell the news. If you sell the news a lot and have a good perception your stock will grow. But it will grow because of stock suply which may be low and the people that are buying which will make the price go up. The bubble will pop only if people will sell. The market cap can be 3 trillions, people screaming is a bubble and it won't pop until either they go bankrupt or people sell fast.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:56:38'] Stock market pricing is attempting to capture future profits and market potential.  Buy the rumor, sell the news.  What are you trying to wrap your head around? Pfizer has plenty of competition and an over weight cost structure.  Tesla’s competitions are years off and some still holding on to dear life the old paradigm of transportation.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:58:52'] Vaccines are not very profitable.  Vaccines are typically one and done (plus whatever few boosters you need).  It will make up a small portion of pfizer’s overall revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:04:27'] It’s about the future potential of the company, not the limited vision of sales. Selling cars is a tiny drop in Tesla’s future potential, when compared to their continuously expanding supercharging global network infrastructure, their self-driving software and the amount of data it has collected so far, Tesla Energy which will soon boom and maybe even split to become a separate company, and the list goes on. Even if their cars business fails overnight (which won’t) the company will still flourish. Pfizer is business as usual. It was just a matter of time until they figure it out. Nothing interesting to see here.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:07:28'] Look into their growth and financials, it's all easily available on any finance platform. They're not a great company, this vaccine won't change that.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:21:33'] 1. A covid vaccine is most likely a one-time opportunity for Pfizer. Meaning, there won't be a second covid vaccine from them, that's ship has sailed. 2. Creating vaccines means spending most of their profit on research. Not much left for investors.3. From an intraday trading perspective I don't know... I was also expecting a bigger rise. I guess people are thinking it's too late to jump on that train because literally everyone knows about the train? It's like leaving a stadium "before everyone else does" and being stomped on by people who were thinking the same thing. Except this time it was the opposite. People thought they would be stomped and stayed watching from aside? I am just speculating here.

A few billions isn’t really much for them for a company that has a revenue of 50 billion a year.... I mean I think Pfizer probably benefited from the publicity of developing the vaccine more than the profit of selling the vaccine.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 20:46:06'] Looked at pfiz. Profit margins on the drug are super Uber thin. It makes for a great long assuming it fits your criteria. Since they have a Vax for Corona-2, Corina-3 vax might be around the cornina. Corona vaccines are super hard to do based on the cellular structure. The fact we have one is great. Just my two cents.

If you dont understand why pfizer isnt up, you probably didnt understand their business in the first place enough to invest
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 21:45:16'] The EV market makes up such a small portion of the worlds car industry rn and it will continue to grow over the years.  Pfizer has already peaked with the people they sell their products to so they don’t have as much room to grow.  Of course there are many other factors but this is probably the biggest.

It worked. It was first. It’s 95% effective. They can sell as much as they can make. They could charge any price. At its peak it moved 16% for me. I made money but I didn’t make the millions I’d hoped.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 21:58:56'] Yeah a friend of mine bought PFE options around 39 and shit. 2 weeks later he sold it.I had pfizer around 34.91 and kept it through up and down.It's a long term stock man you just collect dividends. I was also hoping it would go up a bit because it was the only one that didn't have to stop any trial. I bought in real early but if you can't stomach short term I wouldn't touch pfizer. Any solid company stock with dividends you just set it and forget it.Pfizer also gave me some stocks in their spin off theraputics too during dividend givings.Also you're comparing a meme/super hype stock. You can ride it short term but long term no clue man. All of the cost in Tesla is very speculative because of its potential where as pfizer potential isn't there as much especially for a stable saturate company imo.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 22:29:27'] There’s plenty of perfectly logical and foreseeable reasons that Pfizer is performing the way it is (I won’t repeat them, lots of people are pointing them out here). Tesla is a completely different thing. You can try and retcon some reasoning as to why TSLA skyrocketed to the degree that it has, but it’s a lot less clear and there’s so much more uncertainty surrounding them than a well established pharmaceutical like Pfizer. I just don’t see why you would want to impose the same standard of logic on two completely different stocks. Pfizer’s stock price can be completely logical while Tesla’s is more ambiguous, it doesn’t have to be one or the other.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 23:39:23'] Usually when there’s a such hyperbolic momentum, it’d likely be hedge. I can’t compare TSLA and PFE but my theory behind the reason for TSLA’s never-seen-before pump is the following:- The inevitable hedge happens all the time in the penny stock market. The good ol’ pump and dump. TSLA hasn’t been a penny stock since the beginning so let’s say they were a mid-cap at worst since the start. - Low-cap to mid-cap is a world apart compared to mid-cap going large-cap. It took some big companies to go from mid to large cap at least 2-4 years but a fresh stock like TSLA did it in less than 4 years. It’s not a value stock but growth.- Situational advantage. Did anyone give two sh*ts about EVs 5 years ago? They maybe gave about one shit - A new business model. Big IBs like BAC, JPM has been the ‘founding fathers’ ever since the dinosaurs, but see what happened to PYPL, SQ. The fintech industry came and it made the big boys look ‘outdated’. - Modern figure. Now i’m not comparing Elon to Einstein or Steve Jobs, but if it were to the popularity contest, Elon would easily win. I’m not saying it because i’m a big fan of Elon but objectively speaking, who do you think young adults looks up to? Who has the most buzz? Jeff Bezos? Bill Gates?

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 00:24:25'] Pfizer has the globe literally as a customer. What do you mean by this? They sold 700M covid-19 vaccines out of the 7B ordered, that is a 10% market share. Check out [this link of visual capitalist](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/tracking-covid-19-vaccines-around-the-world/) for a more visual representation.By that logic, one could compare the global EV car sales to the global vaccine sales and see how 'well' Tesla is doing. Yet that would only give you a narrow imagine of what is happening in the actual world.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 00:40:38'] Pfizer is a drug company who's probably looking to sell the vaccine at lowest possible profits considering it is a necessity. The shares will go marginally up but people do need to support medicine companies right now as if Corona virus goes further in danger mode than we need the vaccine asap.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 00:45:25'] No from those examples it is indeed so that especially tesla doesn't make sense.At the same time, your comments still manage to reveal your ignorance. You link growth to how recent achievements in absolute impact. But the absolute impact could already be reflected in the starting market cap or not be reflected there yet, so this is not a relevant metric to see if growth is justified.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 02:00:01'] Pfizer is a healthcare stock, with the given revenue from covid vaccines, it does not increase in value and neither does it cause the company to gain massive market caps.Tesla however has huge upside potential when it comes to technology. Look at apple, apple is worth 2 trillion. It has garnered its reputation to nearly all consumers. An expected yearly revenue makes it a great investment for investors.Pfizer has only a 1x, minimum supply to sell. The vaccine is likely to be signifcantly affordable to every human being on earth. Give or take a possible revenue of 28billion of sales from vaccine. But for tesla, its really about the innovation. You can create a projected growth from technology, but vaccines are but vaccines. You have a limited amount of sales, and a limited amount of revenue to get from itThats why it is hard to be rich by selling necessities and so easy to earn from mark up products.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 02:04:54'] No profit from the vaccine is mostly causing this. If they had opted for a revenue driven approach for the vaccine then things might be different.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 03:49:56'] The reason why is that a stock has little relation to the company itself. A stock might tank even if the company is doing better than last year, or vice versa. A stock might be stationary for years even if a company isn't making any money. You might get that odd jump if the company announces something good, but you can never know how much it will go up, nor if it even will.

While Tesla is the opposite. It is known that some 1.5B shares of Tesla are needed to be bought by the S&P exchange so they have the liquidity needed to function as proper exchange.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 06:39:45'] When it doesn't make sense its not you its the market. Musk himself said his shares are overvalued in march 1st when they were at $90 per share. JPMorgan gave TSLA $90 price target. It happened in 2000, and it will happen again. It might not still be a full bubble that will burst, might take some years or interest rates change, bond yields change and more time and more FOMO. TSLA might go to $500,000 per share, no one gives a fuck until its going up, until it doesn't. Just take their cash flow of the first years they were public, their amount of cars and other products and calculate their annual growth rate. Compare that to the price and ask yourself can this company make 3,600,000 cars alone next year + other products they make? Sounds stupid doesn't it.The market goes up and down constantly just check historic S&P composite chart.Don't forget PFE has a 209B market cap, so its hard for it to move. BNTX is 25B market cap and its much more up this year. Also PFE CEO sold most of his shares and that made so many people sell stock.New game changing stocks are good when they are reasonably priced. Looking at ARK ETF holdings. You want to buy good companies at a reasonable price. There are plenty of them still hit by Covid, that will do great when everything is back to normal.Don't stop doing what you're doing, learn more about fundamental analysis, economics market history.Markets aren't always rational and if you are smart and think 10 years ahead, you can make lots of money from there inefficiencies in the market.There are explanations from economics and you can say people are betting on future companies, who will lead innovation, so people don't want to miss out especially a Tesla number 2? Like who wouldn't want a 400% return? + there is more people investing than ever before with google searches of investing booming.It depends on your risk tolerance and your goals of what you want to achieve? If you have a plan and you are on track with a much safer plan, why risk?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 06:42:19'] The vaccine is economically inconsequential to Pfizer.Every additional 100,000 cars Tesla can sell is validation of the story.That is the difference. I do not agree that 100,000 additional car warrants the increased valuation but it is how the bulls think. You might then ask why Moderna's stock rose so much on the vaccine hype. Their rapid vaccine developed validated Moderna's mRNA platform, opening up many new potential treatments.

They are set to dominate the battery market, they're one of the biggest solar installation companies, are in the lead in terms of revolutionizing transportation, and they're establishing the worlds largest transportation network.  Imagine if self driving cars were a thing. If you own a Tesla you could send out your car to be taxi for 8 hours while you're at work. Tesla would effectively make Uber and Lyft obsolete, they'd be a major competitor to gasoline companies, trucking transportation companies, solar installation, batteries and they'd also make really cool cars while doing all that. Tesla is in the lead to disrupt tons of industries worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Meanwhile Pfizer spent tons of research overhead to come out with a product that really isn't all that profitable.

You should do a comparisn of the two companies. I suggest you compare. How long have they been in business, their balance sheet, how many shares are outstanding, insider ownership,insider buying/selling, average number of shares traded daily, anticipated growth trajectry of their businesses, YoY revenue growth, Where they are in their respective market IE leader,laggard how much market share they have. What are analysts saying about them, their market their competitors. Once you do this comparisn keep the data use it when you look at other stocks. Im sure you will see patrens that will guide your buying, selling decisions for years
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 08:01:50'] There is a relationship between float and market cap. This is why you are confused.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 09:19:49'] Didn’t Pfizer execs sell  like 60% of their shares recently ? That was not a good sign to me.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 09:28:15'] Pfizer isn’t standing up against communism and other far-left oppression. Pfizer is just fulfilling their expectations. Tesla is re-writing how the world will look and operate by accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. Tesla is disrupting: 1) auto industry 2) solar industry 3) energy sector 4) transportation sector 5) Manufacturing, and so much more. You should get very familiar with Tesla. Tonnes of free resources that cover *everything Tesla* every day. And know this: Musk disclosed to the public during the Q3 Investor Call that Tesla is 12 startups in one company.If you’re not invested in Tesla, you’re missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 09:50:27'] Pfizer is only the distributing company to a COVID vaccine.  They didn’t make it. Tesla has innovated so much more and doesn’t make sense to compare growth.  A lot of research is still needed before making a post like this and saying “I understand”.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 10:22:32'] PFE is already priced in - vaccination announcements do not = more revenues. Orders and expectations for this vaccine were already expected, so by the time ya'll bought the price was already reflecting this use. But good news, this is a strong long term position, so keep holding.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 17:41:20'] Study technical analysis instead of fundamentals. You'll have a better time, avoid the nonsense, and make more money. But if you're a gambler, listen to the news.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 22:20:52'] Look into market capitalization. https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/fundamental-analysis/understanding-market-capitalizationThis will explain your confusion. For example, If you are looking to double your money by investing in a stock, remember that stocks represent a share of a company. Their market cap must double for your share to double too.Right now apple is valued at 2 trillion dollars in market cap.Tesla just recently became a $658 billion market cap company. Tesla grew by nearly 10x this year. This means tesla's market cap was around $65.8 billion at the end of 2019 (approximately).It's much harder for a company like apple to double its market cap from $2 trillion-->$4 trillion, and thus for you to double your apple stock, simply due to the amount of money required. It may happen, just not very quickly. Apple is too big already.It is much easier for a company like tesla to double its market cap from $658 billion-->$1.3 trillion, and for you to double your tesla stock, simply because there is less money required. It's a smaller company, so doubling your initial investment is much easier because of the capital required to do so.Hope this helps.Edit: fixed apples market cap, which i had previously written as 4 trillion. It definitely has a 2 trillion dollar marketcap. My fault, it was late.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 16:11:22'] You nailed it. You have no idea how the market works. Justification not necessary.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 17:32:49'] Speculation speculation speculation!!! All things that go up fast must come falling down fast. Doesn’t mean Tesla will not do well in the next 20 years. Tesla is a good company, and will do well(in the long run). But it is not worth its price.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 17:47:10'] Tesla also missed a $100,000,000 euro deposit payment to the German government as part of the their development there. How does any company that size miss a $100,000,000 euro payment and not get lynched?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 18:04:05'] There's like 8 companies creating vaccines for covid-19 now.So there a lot of vaccines outside of project Warp Speed.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 18:10:20'] Vaccines do not generate money for pharma.  So much R/D, FDA, etc etc.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:26:05'] Tesla isnt just an auto manufacturerIt isn’t just an EV/Green energy companyIt isn’t just a battery tech companyIt isn’t just a self driving software companyIt isn’t just a solar panel companyIt isnt just run by the former founder of PayPal who also runs spacex, neuralink and the boring companyBut it also sells apparel
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:43:38'] Stock market makes little sense. Take olin for instance.... they make 90% of the world bleach and bleach derivative products. Without them... the world literally wouldn’t be able to treat water and create drinking and potable water. But their stock price was as low as $9 a share and has only been on the $30 range once in the last 30 years. But Chipotle... which makes burritos is hundreds per share.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 19:48:00'] It is likely already priced in. Considering the size of Pfizer, even 7 billion doses isn’t going to make a huge difference to the bottom line unless they price gouge the fuck out of the world and they will get slammed for doing that. Remember they had revenue of $51.8 BILLION in 2019, with a net worth of something like $218 billion.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 21:47:24'] Lot of comments saying Tesla has a vision. But why do people underestimate Pfizer for vision? They developed a new type of vaccine (mRNA) which is successful. Doesn’t that give them a head start on vaccines for other diseases where there currently isn’t any vaccine? Not trying to compare stock prices but I think it is unfair to say only Tesla has vision in this world.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 22:32:54'] Two words: dividend stock.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-18 22:41:58'] You really think that many people want this vaccine?
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 00:10:45'] Pfizer has a huge market cap that’s why any moves in stock doesn’t have that much impact on the price
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-19 03:19:13'] How fucking hard is it for people to understand drug companies are not going to profit massively from a covid vaccine. It is going to be rushed out at great expense and then sold on at minimal cost.Vaccines are not profitable, its why European and Asian pharma companies aren't as profitable as US ones. Euro/Asian companies develop cures and vaccines, US companies focus on therapeutics and remedies that keep you as a customer. Thats not an option with this, because the Euro/UK pharma companies will just bring out a vaccine and steal their lunch.

The study results were preliminary, based on a review of 94 patients out of the entire 40,000+ sample.  And guess what?  Pfizer's vaccine requires super-cooled storage at -112 degrees F.  And guess what else?  There will be a limited supply that will be allocated to specific groups.Dave and Buster's up almost 50% on the news?  Complete idiocy.

This was zero surprise to me. Can tell you another company that will see a similar jump in a few weeks if you like, along with a few others to keep an eye on. It astounds me people are surprised by all this from a medical/scientific point of view. It's been slated to happen in November for months.But my question to you guys is - is this really worth it?

Vaccines are just inactive viruses.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 22:23:24'] What people don't realize is how big Pfizer is and that the covid vaccine is basically a blip compared to their overall business. Their business model is to bring new drugs to market with sales of 50 million to a couple billion a year with *17 years* of exclusivity.Covid vaccine is going to be a significant moneymaker for them for a couple years tops.  News articles are saying it will be 13 billion between them and BioNTech, so 6.5 billion. Compared to something like Lipitor which made up to 13 billion/year during patent protection and made 2 billion last year while competing with generics, it really doesn't move the needle that much for them.

He sells stock, on a regular schedule, so as not to be seen as trading with inside info, as part of his employment contract. In this case, the schedule had his stock sold just before the vax news, which means he lost out on the entire upside. How is this suspicious activity? It seems to be just the opposite.

He sold after information was public, he sold based on a price target, he sold because his 10b5-1 FORCES you too after it is in. The only thing that you might MIGHT draw issue with is that it cut over 50% of his ownership. That said, I am sure he has more RSU and PSU awards coming.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-11 22:12:32'] A classic pump and dump. Not good at all considering it was from the CEO. Likely realizing that their covid vaccine is in trouble. The requirement of 2 separate shots 3 weeks apart does not sit well at all. Especially for those in life or death situations needing immediate and quick acting vaccines. Then their are also severe logistics issues considering the vaccine requiring extreme sub-zero temperatures for transport. This makes it hard to distribute the vaccine and would likely require localized development which is costly. I don't know....it just seems like Pfizer's entire vaccine development has been too rushed. Perhaps too many corners were cut, plus the FDA being told to allow shortcuts and prioritize the vaccine development just seems too unsafe to me. They are literally taking a process that normally takes years in the making and coming up with something in months. Pretty scary if you think about it.

POST_TEXT: b"FDA Grants Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Pfizer's Group B Streptococcus Vaccine Candidate to Help Prevent Infection in Infants Via Immunization of Pregnant Women. \n\nThis is pretty interesting. So Pfizer's got this now, along with a soon to be approved vaccine for RSV and what looks like most of the market for the annual COVID-19 vaccine. The also acquired a therapeutics company, ReViral,  for the treatment of RSV, putting them in position to have all the solutions for RSV as they have for COVID.\n\nAssuming they settle the dispute with Moderna over IP claims within the next X years, they could emerge as the leader in vaccines. I know many have worried about its ability to continue generating the insane amount of money it has raked in from COVID vaccines, and it looks like those concerns are being answered. \n\nI suspect given its huge cash position ($33B end of Q2), it will continue shopping for cool new therapies to add to its pipeline.

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of.

Metrics I’d look for: Positive cash flow growth, eps growth, rev growth, dividend history and dividend growth %. If it’s > 5% it could be worth looking in to. After that, look at the price of the stock. If it’s near 52 wk high, may not be the right time to buy. I prefer looking for a mixture of the above, but closer to the 52 wk low. Something isn’t quite right at the moment, but still could be a solid company.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-19 23:57:26'] In my opinion, don't invest in companies for their Covid vaccines. However, I do think the success of the Covid vaccine is an indicator of future potential. I own Pfizer because they allegedly have a large pipeline of drugs, and the Covid vaccine resulted in a huge influx of cash that can get reinvested or returned as dividends. However, I don't necessarily see major growth potential the way I do in my other stocks. Yes, it's a financially successful and stable dividend company, but whether it outperforms the market in the next decade probably depends on random FDA decisions and clinical breakthroughs--too much of a blackbox to predict like you can the ad revenue that Google generates. Moreover, I believe some patents are expiring that will cut into revenue.

Pfizer was the wild card because they didn’t take government funding up front. But now they have struck a deal and agreed not to sell the vaccine for a profit. Moderna is the sole remaining company who claims they will profit from their vaccine but they lack any leverage to actually do so. I don’t understand why anyone is bullish on any of these companies. It’s good PR for them if they succeed but there’s little money in it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-22 07:16:37'] The government is basically paying the pharmacy to go ahead and produce their candidates long before approval. If they don't get approved, it's the governments loss not the companies. And if they do get approved, then they're ready to go quickly after. Because how disheartening would it be if in  January (just to name a random month), a company along with the CDC and FDA announced there was a 100% safe and effective vaccine now developed, but it would still take a year to produce enough of. So I take it with a grain of salt. Their vaccine shows enough promise for the Fed to fund some production, but thats about all.

Some news is published about a vaccine trial, the stock shoots up over hope and speculation, then it slowly drops back down in price in the days following.  I think we’re at least a year away from a vaccine. Production and distribution will take quite a bit of time and I don’t necessarily want to keep my capital tied up that long over pure speculation.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-22 10:18:52'] Same option as since the start, there is no long stock profit to be made from this it is a short term profit.  You need to get in there early and then wait for the average stock buyer to go in there and pump up the stock on news and sell before people think out the actual profit to the company.Companies are not going to profit from this.  They will need to sell at near cost and other countries will not protect the legal rights of the company and will manufacturer it once the process is known.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-22 09:13:05'] I'm not buying on this news. There were pharma companies scrambling to make a vaccine for SARS1 back in 2003. It was never released - not because it was particularly scientifically challenging to make a vaccine, but rather by the time the vaccine had been developed and clinical trials were to be planned, the virus had run its course and very few people were still dying from it. We are on the same trajectory with COVID. Either it has mutated into a weaker version, or else society has seen enough exposure that we are developing resistance on the way to immunity. Governments might splurge on a round of vaccinations, but they probably won't be lining up for a second round after nowhere near 100 million people opt for the first round.
	COMMENT: ['2020-07-22 09:49:22'] The vaccines are all for the market hype. They in effect will have little  change in immunization of the population.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 16:50:10'] Great list of stocks. I would suggest UNH, NVO, ELV and TMO - which also happen to be the four I have in my portfolio. Stable long-term performers all of them.NVO is my absolute favorite. You will hardly find a list of top quality or multi factor stocks that doesn’t include NVO. Now they are also moving into the obesity market with a very promising drug Wegovy, which seem to have a huge potential.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 16:13:34'] While several would be good choices, if I had to pick only 1 to check every box, it would be DHR. It is a good balance of P/E, market cap, and growth, with a tiny dividend in on top. I think the business model is far less feast or famine than some of the other choices, bit the company isn't so big as to surrender long term appreciation potential.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 18:42:40'] Could look into GEHC as well. I started pushing GE in my portfolio back around May/June last year anticipating shares would soar once the spinoff started. Definitely served me well since then. Granted GEHC is new as a stand-alone company and there’s been significant share appreciation since early Jan (up almost 80% over my cost basis), I’m still very bullish on the stock. GEHC meets all your criteria too.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 20:57:30'] Idk if I'd buy any individual health names, but I honestly like PFE a lot, at least at today's prices. I bought/sold it for a small profit in 2021. It's basically the same company as 3 years ago except it trimmed off $40B in debt and has loads of cash ready. And is much cheaper than several of the alternatives, who had an amazing 2022. While PFE has had pretty bad comparables coming out of Covid so its share price hasn't moved up as much. (I think I read an article in Barron's about PFE which is quite nice, or maybe it was S. Alpha)The only problem is PFE, and its peers, are probably going to be doing a lot of M&A to grow the pipeline rather than buybacks/dividends (although they already have generous dividends). E.g. Seagen. So they aren't as shareholder friendly in my view. So I don't really know if I care to elevate them in my portfolio beyond market cap weights. The only problem is because of my various sector tilts / individual holdings, I am *really* underweight healthcare.No comment on UNH/TMO/DHR as I know nothing about them. And I'd avoid any kind of biotech companies as those are lottery tickets.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 23:48:54'] DHR keep staying in my buy list. a phenomenal company at reasonable valuation, just not cheap enough for me to buy yet.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-01 02:36:27'] This is what I think:Number 1: Why average down in PFE and wait for a pop and get out? What's the point of that? If its just because you don't like seeing red, that's a bad reason - if you really, really believe it will come back up than go for it but pharma can be a pretty meh business. I'd either hold that sucker or sell it and write it off as a loss, as there are better companies in healthcare. The COVID bump is over for them.Number 2: Healthcare is seemingly a great, defensive sector - I personally own a lot of it, but don't forget that medical debt in the US is ridiculous. Everyone - except maybe only the affluent and probably just the very affluent - hates how our current system is set up. I'm not saying any additional regulatory pressure is coming soon, but you can't rule it out. If I were to invest in healthcare writ large, I'd keep my finger on the pulse of potential regulation.Number 3: All that being said, I kind of really like the tools/medical devices area. It under-performed last year and I think is setting up nicely to outperform - once again (after a decade of significant over-performance) - in the coming years. I also like how this sector is under somewhat less reform scrutiny - when someone gets an outrageous medical bill it's often the drug prices/ambulatory/managed care/hospital stay costs that stand out. Out-of-sight, out-of-mind, I'd say is a good thing in our society. Demographics and health trends, too, are on the side of medical devices (as with all healthcare). I'm by NO MEANS an industry expert so please take my view with a huge grain of salt but from what research I've done, it does seem like this area is particularly well-positioned both for the intermediate and long term. I hope you do more digging upon reading this.I buy the IHI on dips - if I were you, I'd take a deep look into TMO and ABT.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-30 16:34:18'] I’ll be honest, I didn’t read all of that. I came here to suggest XLV. Can’t ever go wrong with a sector ETF.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 03:50:09'] You don’t have to make your money back on the same stock you lost it in. PFE doesn’t know you own it. With that said, plenty of health care stocks sell at high multiples at the moment. Identifying a great company is not the same as identifying a great stock. Probably value to be found in something like JNJ instead. Nobody likes it anymore because the stock chart isn’t an upward slope and the company is facing talc lawsuits. It’s a very diversified business, both geographically and product-wise.I’d recommend keeping it simple and owning an ETF like RYH (S&P 500® Equal Weight Health Care ETF).
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-31 07:02:49'] I have a high cost average with PFE. I am down but have a significant position and the dividends do help to average down. I don’t think I would sell at a loss right now. The acquisitions they have made have me interested. PFE has been boasting their pipelines and have cash on hand. They are acquiring companies.I feel as if the bottom is nearly in.

POST_TEXT: b'[Barrons](https://archive.fo/SDJc9):\n\n>Pfizer shares dropped sharply after the companys 2022 sales guidance appeared to fall short of expectations.\n\n> The guidance that Pfizer (ticker: PFE) presented, however, doesnt take into account future sales of Pfizers Covid-19 vaccine and antiviral, but only sales already made. The number will likely climb upward as the year progresses, suggesting that the selloff on Tuesday may have been based on a misunderstanding.\n> \n> In its earnings release, Pfizer said it expected revenues of between $98 billion and $102 billion in 2022, including Covid vaccine sales of $32 billion and Covid antiviral sales of $22 billion.\n> \n> The antiviral sales guidance met the consensus estimate according to FactSet, but the Covid vaccine guidance fell short by $2.8 billion.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 14:17:59'] It drop 0.46% AH . That's hardly falling. Netflix and Meta is a better example of sharply falling after ER.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 15:02:25'] Bought the dip yesterday
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 22:08:38'] Here is some research I have compiled.- Pfizer is working not only on more mRNA treatments, but many other kinds. You can see here the number of Phase 3 trials [in their pipeline document](https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/product-pipeline/Pipeline_Update_08FEB2022.pdf?1LyL7HgKeLza5jVNXvCDNKZhykNz2IGT). They have between 25-30 drugs in each of the Phases (1, 2, and 3), and then 10 in the final 'registration' step. This adds up to a total of 89 drugs in some type of late stage clinical trial. Merck has about 30 drugs as well in Phase 3, but a much larger 79 in Phase 2. But Merck also didn't successfully benefit from Covid-19 like Pfizer. Both have similar P/E ratios.- Their P/E ratio is extremely cheap: 7.7 trailing, 12 forward; the sector median is 21.- They are constantly coming up with new collaborations, like using genetic editing to treat diseases. For example, there is a recent collaboration with BEAM pharmaceuticals [(Source)](https://www.biospace.com/article/pfizer-triple-partners-for-future-mrna-vaccines-and-genetic-medicines-/). Moreover, "PFE has bolstered its pipeline by multiple acquisitions such as Arena Pharmaceuticals, Array BioPharma, Therachon, and Trillium Therapeutics Inc since 2019." Source: a SA link I cannot post.- Free Cash Flow (FCF) is substantial, yielding more money to spend in R&D, share buybacks, dividends, and investments. "Sales of its COVID-19 vaccine have provided a windfall of cash for Pfizer over the past 12 months. In 2020 and 2019, the healthcare giant accumulated $11.6 billion and $10 billion in free cash flow, respectively. But over the past four quarters, its free cash flow surged to $29.2 billion."  The FCF figure of 29.2 billion is a third of Apple's FCF of 93 billion, for comparison. [Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/12/3-growth-stocks-that-have-generated-179-billion-in/)- Moderna, by comparison: "Moderna had 14 non-Covid drugs in its pipeline as of a few months ago, one of which is late-stage. Pfizer has 100, 25 of which are late stage. Moderna is too Covid-dependent." [This is quoting a comment I made a long time ago, but I don't remember where I sourced that statistic.]My takeaways are: It's a very cheap stock; there is a lot more to it than Covid, although it will continue to reap benefits from it; it has tons of cash to spend; Covid demonstrated their innovative ability, not to mention their past history of success.Risk: they seem to have a patent cliff in 2024, but their robust pipeline makes this less worrisome. Also, mRNA vaccines may not be successful, since I believe a fundamental problem with this type of technology is poor longevity, compared to traditional DNA vaccines. [I need to recheck this again.]
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 17:06:20'] >Do you think Pfizer is undervalued right now due to incorrect interpretation of future vaccine and anti-viral drug sale projections?I believe Pfizer is trading at a very slight premium due to an incorrect interpretation from the market of COVID related sales going into late 2022 and, more importantly, 2023-2025. I expect such a revenue to actually taper off, not grow, sharply.>More a more general level, do you think Pfizer is going to wisely invest its covid windfall and develop great revenue streams?I think Pfizer already has invested some of the COVID related profits wisely, though they remain behind the industry average for R&D investments if I'm remembering right. Pfizer sports 89 products on their pipeline, ten of which in the process of being registered (5 COVID related).>Do you consider Pfizer a great buy or not? Is this a long term hold? The pe ratio is 13. Is that considered normal for drug companies?1. I think, despite saying earlier it's trading at a premium, it's still a decent *investment.* I'd wait before pulling the trigger though.2. Yes, Pfzier is a long term hold. Aside from sporting a healthy dividend TTM 3.04% yield (39.69% payout ratio), which is already attractive to me, Pfizer has a substantial stable moat in the Healthcare space. A diversified product catalogue and no patents expiring till 2028 (Eliquis comes to mind) alongside a strong distribution network all help to keep it's pricing power for drugs in the company's favor.3. Pfizer's p/e ratio of 15.83 (where did you get 13?) is fairly competitive with other companies in the industry. Similar to other companies like $NVS and $MRK that I'd recommend to others for due diligence research.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 18:01:58'] Overly dramatic sell-off imo.I am expecting a lot more than 22B for Paxlovid sales in 2022. Also remember that the shelf life of Paxlovid is around 3 years. Countries will want a ready healthy supply in case of future variants and to avoid overcrowding of hospitals.>(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Tuesday it expects 2022 sales of its COVID-19 vaccine and antiviral pill to top $54 billion, but that fell short of lofty Wall Street estimates and its shares were off about 3%.  >  >Still, Chief Executive Albert Bourla said final sales for its oral COVID-19 antiviral, Paxlovid, could be “way bigger” than what Pfizer has forecast since its current outlook **only included contracts that have been or are close to being signed.**  >  >Pfizer currently expects $22 billion in 2022 sales of the treatment, compared with Wall Street estimates of $22.88 billion.  >  >"Clearly, this is only a fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture" this year, Bourla told analysts on a conference call.  >  >The company is selling 20 million courses of Paxlovid to the United States at around $530 a course, but Bourla said that was a special price because of the size of the order.  >  >The price for most high income countries, he said, would be more or less in line with the price of Merck & Co’s rival treatment molnupiravir, which the U.S. government bought for around $700 a course.  >  >**Pfizer executives said the company is in active discussions with over 100 countries about Paxlovid, and has the capacity to top 120 million courses if needed.**
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 15:09:02'] I bought the dip yesterday.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 16:59:26'] The article doesn't make much sense.First it says guidance is only relying on sales already made. Guidance is forward looking, not backwards looking.Second, regardless of revenue, they are still guiding down on vaccines. Who cares about revenue when they are missing guidance? Am I misreading something here?Edit: Looked up the article. Apparently Pfizer is breaking with all tradition in not using future estimates to guide future estimates.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 20:37:15'] Honestly I held Pfizer for 3.5 months and it was a pretty reliable stock vs the markets at large. Got out at 12% up pre-earnings because nothing really moves the stock and I wanted to free up the cap. Solid fundamentals, low beta, much govt. backing from multiple countries, would buy again for an actual long term hold.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 14:57:36'] I’m bullish on Pfizer. This is a $60 stock easy just based on current revenues. When a new variant hits in the fall having more of this stock in your portfolio will at least cushion the blow.In the meantime, the dividend and solid floor provide protection.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-09 16:05:27'] Where's the dude who wants to constantly short this stock because of the coming red wave?I'm bullish but not because of vaccine revenues as much as the longer term pipeline of drugs, and any future treatments coming out of the Covid technological developments.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-31 19:41:34'] While secreted antibodies have a half-life, the B cells that produce them stick around as memory cells and continue to produce more antibodies.  That's part of the reason why you only need a booster of the tetanus vaccine every 10 years and the HBV vaccine doesn't need a booster at all as an adult.  Trying to predict future antibody titers based on IgG half-life is an exercise in futility.Additionally, you cant compare antibodies generated from infection to antibodies generated by the vaccine.  Many of the antibodies you produce during infection are useless for neutralization as they will target non-spike epitopes.  In contrast, all antibodies you produce from the vaccine are targeted against the spike protein.

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-06 13:52:49'] Long term, very good. They're a big portion of my overly diversified portfolio. They have a huge pipeline and many blockbuster drugs. Short term, probably head winds from drug cost lowering plans from the US government, which have bipartisan support.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 09:03:34'] Abbvie by far. Before the sickness hit pfizer had years of declining revenue. They are riding high with one event. Long term pfizer doesn't look a good bet. Abbvie finds ways to consistently grow revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 10:17:37'] Abbvie has that much debt? Damn. I think that the most important aspect for stock price is the pipeline and the portfolio. I would own both, and I do, but i own more Pfizer. They're 1) better positioned to capture revenue and grow business in chronic non antibody therapy disease. 2) more adaptable since the pandemic 3) in a better position financially 4) mRNA has more growth potential than antibody therapy due to lack of competition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 17:13:27'] ABBV without question,simply because they are loyal to the shareholders, as well as constantly staying ahead of the game.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 15:03:41'] Sanofi (SNY). It's at a massive discount because it got caught up in the European market selloff.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 18:46:40'] ABBV
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-07 09:07:51'] I’ve got both but more in Pfizer. I like Pfizer because I think the pandemic actually permanently changed the business. Look how fast they were able to move and develop, and they were in a position to outmaneuver rivals in becoming the dominant vaccine company. Not only that, I think people are underestimating the business that will come from Covid being endemic. Their anti-Covid pill could end up delivering beyond expectations. Then there’s the fact that if another variant does become a concern, this stock could spike to $60 again in short order. A lot of potential catalysts here.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-04 11:25:16'] It might be that future growth was priced into the share price and became overextended and the reduction they have seen is them at more reasonable value without the "hype" of unsustainable future growth influencing the share price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-04 12:44:07'] Moderna was incredibly overpriced. Anyone who didn't see a pullback coming is out to lunch. And it's still trading at a  P/S of >18. Compare that to the P/S of other major pharma companies:MRK: 4.2PFE: 4.3LLY: 8.1NVS: 3.6GSK: 2.9

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-05 10:48:16'] Short-term thinking is what is driving the price action we are seeing in stocks like this. Monopolistic qualities are best shown through large differences n margins compared to the rest of a given industry. $MRNA shines in this regard as they have [absolutely killed it in terms of EBITDA margins](https://viz.wiijii.co/chart/?id=-MlGZDt_AO86X1nux47d) and I don't expect them to slow down anytime soon.

	COMMENT: ['2022-01-11 16:43:25'] Pfizer is also collaborating with small R&D pharma companies as well.  They advanced $22M to a Cambridge based company named Voyager.  This company specializes in targeting the cells and tissues causing ALS through gene therapy.  I have Pfizer in my portfolio.  I was messing around with a portfolio revamping app and it recommended adding another 30% more to it.  I watch the stock movement and on days when good news comes out for Pfizer the price drops.  Ex, the announcement of Pfizer’s Covid pills, the stock dropped back from the 60’s toward the mid-50’s - go figure.  I’m still thinking about adding more.

Expectations already decimated.- GOOG will miss and probably be flat. Some positive news on share buybacks.- AAPL: No clue. I think to the downside.- XOM: Will rise 3-4% on massive share buybacks/dividend announcement (Chevron didn't get that much heat for theirs). - SBUX: Will not only beat earnings, will give insanely good guidance thanks to China.

The big pharmaceutical company and partner BioNTech became the first to launch a vaccine. And that product now has fully vaccinated 49 million Americans. That's more than rivals Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Pfizer recently forecast $15 billion in coronavirus vaccine revenue this year.\n\n>But Pfizer isn't stopping there.

	COMMENT: ['2021-05-01 12:52:48'] I have BioNTech shares - for them this is a much bigger deal given their small size. Remember, they were the ones who developed the vaccine and hold the patent. Pfizer is the (very powerful) production and distribution partner.

POST_TEXT: b'I just received the Pfizer vaccine today (woot!) which lead me to check out their stock and financials. Their revenue didnt budge in 2020! Why is that? I thought rolling out this vaccine would make them rich. Is that still a possibility, cause their price is low now!?\n\nWhats the deal with Pfizer?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 00:27:19'] Small potatoes for a company that size.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 02:03:18'] Big Pharma is liking their names getting out there right now, so pretty much doing research and development for marketing/exposure. Vaccines have low profit margins because they’re generally a one time thing. Also with something like covid-19, if big Pharma tried to make big gains off of a global pandemic, they would get nothing but backlash.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 02:50:02'] Because the vaccine is actually developed by BionTech ($BNTX), which has gone up significantly. Pfizer is just their clinical trials and distribution partner I believe.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 01:21:07'] To move the needle at a giant like Pfizer, it's got to be an expensive, high-volume product that they can sell year after year. This vaccine won't do that unless people end up needing yearly booster shots.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 00:27:06'] Vaccines don’t make big profits.the profit margin is slim ( distribution/supply chain stuff)Also, most of the revenue will come 2021. Things didn’t really get rolling until late December

	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 00:41:08'] Two words: High Float
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 01:10:19'] Getting VTRS shares also probably played a role in the share price not jumping.If you count VTRS shares, holdings of PFE are currently at around $40 a share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 00:27:37'] That's what I thought so too!
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 06:09:24'] Not much money in vaccines, tons of resources allocated to producing it taking them away from focus on true profit making ventures..also, long term, once the single dose JNJ vaccine comes who will want the Pfizer two dose vaccine?
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 07:20:49'] Even if the vaccine does not make them an extraordinary profit, having succeeded in that vaccine is very good for their reputation.  The stock looks a buy to me personally.  I will have to recheck that I own it or not.  I think I might.As a mostly dividend investor, this is a good one.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 10:34:21'] BNTX partnered with them. Check their financials. Probably a bigger drop in their bucket
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 11:37:21'] There are three reasons: 1. This is mainly a Biontech vaccine, they will make a bigger profit on the vaccine than Phizer who are just supporting with production and distribution, but Biontech could find different partners for that in the future if Pfizer doesn't offer them an attractive deal. 2. The properties of the vaccine cause it to be much more expensive and much more difficult to handle than competition (coldest temperatures needed). It's likely that once the shortage is over the Biontech vaccine will not be successful on the market anymore. 3. It's still only small revenues and profits compared to the scope of Pfizer. In my opinion, this vaccine has value for Pfizer, but the value is small and limited.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 04:09:47'] Because this isn't some small-mid cap bs.  If people start driving up the price then all those long term holders would just sell them the elevated share price.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 05:53:49'] Its already in the share priced
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 10:00:47'] Why should it? There isn't as much money in there as you would think.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 17:56:02'] You have to factors in the billions the company is worth and the earnings that are projected to come in. They not very much compared to overall value.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-02 23:16:45'] Things I learned recently on reddit:1) vaccines & pharma and #64 on the fortune 500 = boring company, not worth investing in2) if you either own currently closed movie theaters or stores at the mall both of which involve things most people seem more inclined to download from the web = $$$I get the short/squeeze thing, but if people think this vaccine will be a one time small thing without much future potential, call me skeptical.  Covid isn't going away, and the technology opens up many more vaccines and treatments down the road.  $34.50 today seemed cheap.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 00:32:32'] Vaccines do not bring as much revenue as one might think. To be honest most of the Big Pharma invests very little in making one. The only reason some of them started researching the COVID-19 vasccine is because of the publicity around their name not the actual revenue. It’s been discussed before the pandemic , a quick google search will confirm, that we are due a pandemic because none of the big Pharma are interested in investing in vaccines and the current ones are close to absolete. I remember a specific article i read that we are due a super bug mainly because of the Chinese farmers who are shoving strong antibiotics down their pigs throats thus creating superbugs immune to our current medicines. Tldr: vaccines do not bring revenue, just free publicity
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 07:04:40'] Yeah I don't understand sentiment that vaccine is small one time thing. It's P2W. Immunity lasts for 6-12 months or something. World will need this vaccine like crack.
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 07:15:40'] Becasue they did it for non profit
	COMMENT: ['2021-01-24 00:40:32'] My thinking was similar. I had Novavax, Moderna, BioNTech, and Pfizer, bought these before news of any vaccines. Sold them all recently for about break even. Total waste of time.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 01:25:50'] Technically, the stock ran into resistance and retreated accordingly.  Have a look at the Bollinger Bands and you will have better context for the price movement.Businesswise, I think most sophisticated pharma investors understand that vaccines are a relatively low margin business.  So, while COVID vaccinations should be good for the market writ large, it isn't likely to impact a stock like Pfizer much unless something goes horribly wrong. My sense is that it is a good company with an overvalued stock.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 07:56:43'] I bought BioNtect weeks before it the vaccine was approved anywhere at $119. It dropped back down to $119 today so I sold it all.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 06:32:53'] Pfizer is a massive company with an extremely diversified product line. The vaccine probably won’t have an incredible effect on its bottom line. It’s also possible that the market is (for once) taking the long view, and realizing that this is likely just a short-term boost to Pfizer that will give them some nice cash flows and good press for say, a year, but will ultimately not have a crazy long-term effect once the pandemic is over.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 09:57:58'] It was the same with GILD and Remdesivir...
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 14:01:29'] The revenues from the vaccine will be minimal (they can't charge $6000 for the vaccine like they would if this was a normal drug for them) and they also have to split those profits with their partner, Biontech.  Additionally, by diverting resources to covid, they passed up on research into their other opportunities.  This effectively sidelined their high revenue potential future plays.  So the vaccine is a "public good will" victory for them, not a monetary one.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 01:21:06'] I wouldn't bet anything on the vaccine companies. I'd focus on solid companes that are fairly valued and relative to that have juicy profitable earnings growth future outlook.

	COMMENT: ['2021-03-23 18:48:00'] It's market manipulation by the truly Elite. PFE is the most held stock in the Stock Market history nearly every pension fund, retirement portfolio, etc... has PFE stock therefore certain sector in the nation can't allow the stock to go up because it would make a ton of people a ton of money. Probably triggering inflation, or if at least 50% of the stock owners sell after profiting it could really fuck up the market.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-28 17:32:44'] LOL.  A bunch of European countries cannot even decide whether the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe.  The on again/off again decisions about it have scaremongered people into not wanting to use it.  Now they are suing to get what they were refusing to use.  This really looks like a cover-your-ass move for leaders responsible for an incompetent vaccination rollout.Meanwhile the U.S. and the U.K. spent billions on R&D and building production facilities before vaccines were proven efficacious, betting on multiple possibilities in hopes that at least one would work out.  European incompetence makes makes me wonder whether we can take advantage of their shambolic vaccination program by first making money with recovery stocks in the U.S. and U.K. then moving some of the profits into recovery stocks in the EU.  Maybe three to four month gap is too short.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 14:50:42'] Its complicated but pfizer is actually losing money on this vaccine. They used all their research power to make this vaccine instead of a high profitable drug like the next viagra
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 15:02:49'] Pfizer’s vaccine was actually developed by BioNTech using mRNA formula. This new technology is cutting edge. With it, scientists can develop vaccine candidates in matter of days. Only Prifzer-BioNTech and Merderna’s COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA. It was reported that it only took Merderna 2 days to develop its vaccine candidates after the Chinese released the COVID-19 virus sequence in Jan 2020. This technology is invaluable. Only BioNTech and Merderna own the technology. Prizer doesn’t. Stock prices are always forward looking. So people place their their bets on the technology for future vaccine development not one time shot which is Pfizer.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 17:13:00'] Covid vaccines aren't particularly profitable because making them accessible to as many people as possible also means selling them as cheaply as possible. Good for the world, bad for the stonks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 18:14:03'] So there are a number of reasons why this has not skyrocketed and you are not the first to think so, two of my friends started investing *because* they thought Pfizer would take off. One of the most prominent reasons is because Pfizer is a *massive* company, and while they are expected to lose money on the vaccine, any profits they would make would be very little compared to all of their branches where they regularly lose and earn (and pros/cons of having your eggs in a lot of different baskets - look at Moderna which put everything in mRNA vaccines, a much smaller basket with more eggs and success would be more impactful on the company). Another is a successful vaccine means you should not be a returning customer (I know, I know, it's two dosages and maybe future generations will be vaccinated as well). But a vaccine is not like a car or a subscription plan, there will be a very highly concentrated spike in demand (which we are seeing now) and then a drop off as the disease disappears. Thirdly,  as I mentioned and so have others, this is not a profitable vaccine and they themselves did not develop it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 17:20:25'] I bought and it only went UP. By the time the vaccine was approved for roll out; however, it has been more of a sideways downward drift. The projection were “already priced in” and/or it simply proves markets aren’t predictable.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-09 01:56:41'] Never expected it to shoot up, but thought it would be between 38 to 40 range once vaccine starts rolling. Getting some gain and a dividend.Biggest mistake made so far, could have bought literally any other stock and would have made money.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 18:14:49'] Their pipeline is solid and current products are solid. I treat my PFE(2% of my portfolio) as a bond proxy with that dividend. My average price is about $28 so I'm happy with that. Started buying in 2018 and averaged down last March big time.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 18:52:46'] The float is over 5 billion shares, it is MASSIVE and takes a lot to move this stock. My 2022 leaps are getting destroyed
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-08 17:06:07'] Your shares are only worth what people are willing to pay for. Just coz theres news, doesn't mean People want to buy. I think it's difficult to predict non tech companies movement atm as so much focus is on modern tech, genomic and space at the moment.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 11:26:36'] FYI - Authorization probably won't come until Monday. After the committee meets, it will take a day or two for FDA to give EUA.&#x200B;Shots in arms starts Tuesday the 15 of December, 2020.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 11:32:47'] CCL
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 12:11:57'] I’d stay away from airlines. Even if travel opens back up these companies are in so much debt from this they will be struggling for years to come. Well I say that but 2020 clearly shows people don’t give a shit about earning ratios or anything anymore since stock prices are out of control; so maybe take that advice with a grain of salt but logically those companies are still in deep.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 12:42:31'] You're late to the party with all those picks.  Most recovery stocks rallied hard on Nov 9th and then again on Nov 24th...They may have another rally on vaccine approval but it looks like most of the vaccine news is priced in post Nov 24th.&#x200B;For oil "NOG" "KOS" and "CPE" are my choice after everything has rallied so hard.  These look like they've still got some room to run up."RUTH" for sit down dining."SOHO" for hotels.  "PEI" for shopping centers(This one is really beat up still and probably the most risky."MDRR" for real estate.  Most of those tickers still have room to triple before they hit their 52wk high.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 18:40:12'] If you are going for airlines, find which airline has the fewest business travellers.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 10:15:32'] DAL, forget about AAL
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 16:37:56'] I wonder how much of the vaccine approvals for Pfizer and Moderna have NOT been priced in to the market yet. I thought everyone has already assumed that those are getting approved.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 17:24:09'] Would be buying RDSB for the oil play, still down huge YTD, options are cheap and they actually printed a positive eps last quarter which is pretty amazing. Foreign demand is big because of tax benefit. BP as well.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 14:34:32'] $AAL is good. I would pick Delta over UA.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-08 20:49:41'] Stop with the airlines you dolts!!  Airlines burn fuel, 8% of global demand at peak!!  But not just that, when people to start traveling again, they’ll drive there too, 40% of global demand!!  Fuel (and energy in general) will recover and there are leveraged etfs to take advantage of it at 2x.  AND a lot of institutions aren’t buying back into fuel yet because of politics and because reserves are really high. When fuel dropped to -$40 or whatever it was; anyone who had the ability to store fuel did, so reserves are PACKED. Institutional investors are looking at those numbers and waiting them to start dropping (they haven’t) before they buy back in. But at some point... especially if people start traveling by air or road, those reserves will drop and fuel demand will resume.And before y’all start saying “but renewables”. YES. ABSOLUTELY!!   But they’re not building out fast enough to address next year’s spike in travel resumption. (Is resumption a word?)(I’m heavily invested in renewables too -FAN is a favorite- but oil is the buy low, sell high for the next six/eight months because oil got HAMMERED!)Take my advice for what you paid for it.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-12 07:27:51'] Hope Pfizer gets pumped again, looking to dump it
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-13 06:19:19'] They'll be boosted again when/if the Pfizer vaccine gets FDA approval. Which is supposed to be announced near the end of this month, if they get it (which is likely). The vaccine is actually being approved for emergency use. So if you can vaccinate the high risk people, and stop Covid from being lethal, you're in a much better position. In my opinion, countries are likely going to race to get their vaccination rates up high (probably >70-90%). And then the countries with high rates will form 'travel bubbles'.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-12 07:36:24'] Btw pfizer didn't develop the vaccine the only helped to test it for the german company Biontech

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-12 06:28:55'] Absolutely. It's just PR.MRNA is very good.Earnings are forecast to grow 3.34% per year.MRNA exceeded the US Biotechs industry which returned 29.8% over the past year.Trading at 11.81x Price to Book ratio.Can't say what a fair price is but I'm holding to at least $100.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-12 07:57:47'] Is Moderna supposed to announce something about their vaccine any time soon?
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-12 06:58:17'] Pretty unlikely. We already have Pfizer's vaccine and the market likely expects Moderna's to also show good results, although if it does not, then I expect the market will drop pretty big.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-12 10:56:19'] I just bought a $70 put on MRNA. I see them going back to $55 or lower. There's no way they're going to get a brand new type of vaccine developed AND approved. Nor are they in a great position to help with the manufacturing of vaccines like Pfizer's.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:15:29'] Don't think there's a lot of profit made from covid vaccines, I was under the impression that most would be sold at cost or a little over cost so that poorer nations could be subsidised
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:00:08'] I’m guessing here but as more vaccines get approved that means there is less market share available for them. Also a chance that the market doesn’t think this will need to be a recurring shot.
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-19 12:38:19'] There is no profit in vaccines. Most developed countries have laws preventing profiteering and under developed countries simply can’t afford excessive prices. Not sure why anyone thought a vaccine would be a cash cow...

POST_TEXT: b'Im genuinely confused why Pfizer stock has been puttering around the same point while Moderna is going up by leaps and bounds.   Even its partner BNTX has has a slow start with gains quickly being taken back.

Yet the stock had been more or less a stale mate.  What gives with Pfizer? Im getting more and more convinced it will not go up much even after Dec 10 when the FDA is due to meet.  Any thoughts?'
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-30 18:36:45'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-30 18:47:41'] Pfizer is seen as a pharma company while Moderna and Novavax are seen as Tech companies. Similar to what you see  happening with Tesla and Nio. It’s all about perception and it’s easy to build projections for something which people don’t know about. It’s up to you to dream and forecast growth.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-01 07:58:04'] They also spun out part of company as VTRI. That might also have an affect that stock price is hovering around same range.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-30 20:08:56'] I believe your suspicion is going to be factual.  PFE is a 130 year old dinosaur. Many of their patents are expiring hoping to develop new ones. If you think Covid vaccine will generate profit that will not happen to any US companies.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-04 16:54:23'] Good question. I tend to add to the stocks that I feel are performing below their true value. However, I respect the diversity strategy I laid out (i.e., I said I would invest X amount into Stock Y over the course of the next year. Stock Y recently slumped to ATLs, which would make a great DCA opportunity. However, I have already invested the X amount I planned to invest into that position, so I am not adding more to my Stock Y position. I am capped out on Stock Y. I respect that allocation I planned out.)I respect my plan and keep diversification in mind at all times because I feel it'd be very easy to over-expose yourself to a particular position by DCAing too much just on the feeling that it is undervalued. Sometimes, the dip keeps dipping. Sometimes, it sucks. However, plans are there for a reason.  For protection. Recent examples where I encountered this very situation:I wanted to add to my Pfizer position in December, but then it went on a rally around my pay day. I didn't like that this rally brought it to near ATHs. I opted to add to another position. This month, I felt PayPal was undervalued. It started to rally. However, I added to my PayPal position as I felt there was strength to the rally.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-03 21:13:04'] Some of that has to do with the enormous size of Pfizer ... And the challenging logistics of distributing their product.   Still, it's not a loser, and the 2nd qtr next year will prove that.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-03 22:10:57'] From what I understand the first wave of vaccines will be sold pretty much at cost, they'll make very little off it, the profit will come during years 2/3/4 etc.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-03 21:16:50'] Pfizer's market cap is much, much bigger than Moderna's. Can't just look at the stock price in evaluation. While I did mull over possibly buying them months ago, I decided not to. I felt as if they weren't going to see much growth.Also, you must have missed that report today about them having some supply chain issues.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-03 23:21:04'] I don't really think any of the covid-19 will be great long term i think they will have a short-spike and then average down. The government will not let them make vaccines expensive wich i think will result in less profit than most shareholders will hope for.

Since then Moderna has gone up $100. BioNtech has gone up around $60. Pfizer hasn’t moved at all. Makes no sense
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 07:46:33'] This question is posted here 2 times per day. Pfizer is too big of a company to be affected by their vaccines. Whatever increase the vaccine gave is priced in anw for awhile now...

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-15 08:27:11'] Some simple explanations: cost to make the vaccine, having to make it available at reasonable prices, competition soon having the vaccine themselves, concentrating a large portion of their company in 2020 to one drug instead of multiple other drugs. Etc.

They seem to be doing more due diligence before going to the clinic than Moderna. Pfizer thinks both drugs have a chance, and they have the money to back both.\n\nModerna just seems like a circus act. Maximum speed, tons of press, and the executives just cashed in big time.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 14:29:20'] In the UK AZN started enrollment of Phase 3 in Late May. They had 8 thousand by mid July. Brazil and Africa started Phase 3 in Late June. August 18 they started Phase 3 in the USA.Moderna started Phase 3 July 27. MRNA is pretty shady but their published results for Phase 1 were promising. A lot of people dumped the stock after it pumped on results because of insiders selling but the results themselves were just as reliable as other vaccines for Phase 1.I'm not to familiar with BioNTech. MRNA is a difficult one to believe because, insider selling, no therapies to market, never before approved therapy, and they are against Bio Giants that have actual therapies under their belt and some manufacturers are using proving delivery methods.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 15:07:31'] Nobody knows.  Most don't make it through phase 3, and it's not like the race is just to get a vaccine, efficacy and distribution matters.  It's the absolute key.  Whoever has the best vaccine will win, unless they are all about the same.Pfizer is out I think though if their's doesn't have the efficacy lead.  Their vaccine requires transportation at -94F, which is going to be really hard to distribute.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 15:33:33'] Moderna could blow up more but more risk
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 19:25:09'] To be fair, NO ONE has 'real data' on the efficacy of any vaccine until Phase 3 results are published. That's what Phase 3 trials are for.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-06 21:05:32'] Honest talk for a moment.  No one who doesn't HAVE to have a COVID 19 vaccine shot will have the COVID 19 vaccine shot by the time it reaches the general market. By the time they come up with a valid, stable vaccine for Covid 19, we will be, for the most part, over it. This stock race for the vaccine is pointless imho.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 01:35:32'] Pfizer was huge before and is huge now. The vaccine won’t change that because they won’t price gauge as it would be too risky from a political standpoint. Sure, they will earn a lot from it anyway but compared to Pfizer’s overall size it’s really not that significant.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 01:33:27'] As other comment mentioned the logistics and storaging are difficlt problems. The tests are not complete either as they tested covid only from those participants who had symptoms. The vaccine could just erase the symptoms instead of covid itself. That would be a good thing too but the fact is that they aren't done experimenting the vaccine.

Maybe someone else can look at that ratio and figure it out.Maybe it hasn't all settled out yet.Just because VTRS shares were trading $15 - $16 when issued and around the same of the first day of trading doesn't mean that's your cost basis.

POST_TEXT: b'Market rally *incoming* (?)\n\n* * *\n\nAn experimental Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the drug giant Pfizer and the biotech firm BioNTech spurred immune responses in healthy patients, but also caused fever and other side effects, especially at higher doses.\n\nThe first clinical data on the vaccine were disclosed Wednesday in a paper released on MedRXiv, a preprint server, meaning it has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal. \n\nThe Pfizer study randomly assigned 45 patients to get one of three doses of the vaccine or placebo. Twelve receive a 10 microgram dose, 12 a 30 g dose, 12 a 100 g dose, and nine a placebo. The 100 g dose caused fevers in half of patients; a second dose was not given at that level.\n\nFollowing a second injection three weeks later of the other doses, 8.3% of the participants in the 10 g group and 75% of those in the 30 g group developed fevers.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 08:39:10'] PFE was higher in mid-2016 than it is right now. It was flat in 2020. It’s down since mid 2018.It was the first company to come out with its “final” vaccine news in early November, and it held its gains from that news for all of a few days.It popped again in December (but still not to its ATH) and completely retraced that gain in 2 weeks, and has been slowly falling ever since.I can’t imagine why anyone would be playing this stock for anything shorter than multiple years
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-15 09:18:28'] Pfizer isn’t going up anytime soon to a price worth playing. Their next earnings should show substantial growth and their forward P/E puts them at a lower ratio than any other big pharma company. But still I see that maybe putting them back around $38. It’s a slow boat. Too many retailers have been burned trying to play options, but the float is so large on this that that institutions just crush any large OI. Exactly what happened after the December pop. People bought tons of options on Pfizer, citadel probably sold all of those options, and then shorted the stock down.

I am in finance and it always concerned me how concentrated of a position it has been because my grandparents currently have an emotional attachment to the holdings. Stupid.  I have beaten this dead horse for years - reduce the position and invest in other things.  However,  if i were to have an emotional attachment to money (never, hah.), PFE isn't a bad name...You need to love, understand, and appreciate....management. PFE's CEO impressed me on a recent earnings call when he went ballistic on an analyst asking for more stock buybacks. PFE's CEO in so many words said we aren't buying back any stock when there are opportunities to grow retained earnings and invest in the business.  Period.  There's a good chance the stock sees some lower levels, but I like the setup for the long haul and I really like the current management telling folks that profit from short term gains to get bent, we have a long term business to run.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:05:56'] The vaccines, from any and all companies, are not being priced for profit. Regardless, PFE is a good long-term hold with a strong dividend.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:47:10'] Pfizer is a massive company, where it would need a pretty insane amount of buys for it to affect stocks.It shot up on announcement of vaccine by like 5-8% from what I remember, which is pretty significant considering how big the company is
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:08:09'] PFE did spike about 9% on the day of news. Then Amazon announced their online pharmacy and PFE took a hit.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-24 14:09:58'] I think they’s a hearing for emergency approval of the vaccine in mid December (Dec. 15th?), which is before moderna’s. I would be shocked if the FDA didn’t approve it. If they do, I’d expect a bounce then at least in the short term, however idk about long term prospects— the vaccine will help drug companies gain notoriety but probably not contribute much to profits.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-25 00:06:29'] a big pharma company means more than this. they make the vaccines so we can resume life and consume their products.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-25 02:36:44'] I also hold Pfizer stock. Part of the reason might be Pfizer spun off part of its business into a different company with a different ticker for regulatory reasons it seems.

POST_TEXT: b'Opko health... read this and let me know if anyone else is seeing this.   \nHow do companies protect themselves against insider trading? Typically, anyone who could have access to financial data ahead of public disclosures have limited trading windows after results are announced to trade the stock. Also, there may be restrictions on how they can trade in that trading window. For example, suppose a company releases quarterly earnings on April 15, July 15, October 15, and January 15. Executives and people with access to financial data may only be able to trade the stock in the month following release of financial data (e.g., May 1-31, August 1-31, November 1-30, and February 1-28). Also, since an executive selling a large amount of stock could be viewed as bad and drive the value down, some companies also require key executives to give 30 days notice of their plans to buy or sell stock. Again, it is to prevent insider trading. If you are able to read that the CEO is planning to sell $1B '

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 13:10:56'] Pfizer is a huge company. People don't understand how big that company is. The cap on Pfizer is $217B. At one time they were one of the top five largest companies in the US (By market cap).  By contrast, AMC is a "micro cap" company with a market cap of $393M. In other words, Pfizer is almost 1000 times larger than AMC. Red Robin has a $277M market cap. The hotel chain Marriott has a $38B market cap; much, much larger than AMC or Red Robin, but still about 1/8th that of Pfizer. Furthermore, Restaurants, theaters and hotels have lost HUGE chunks of business due to the pandemic, whereas Pfizer has lost virtually zero business due to the pandemic.  Once a vaccine starts becoming used by the public those restaurants, hotels, theaters (and casinos and airlines, too) are going to get much of that business back, whereas, it will only represent a small amount of Pfizer's total business.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-11 19:09:23'] Sell the news.Edit: if the vaccine is available for free to millions of Americans, that’s not the same as selling millions of doses, as the sale will be government subsidized and not at retail markup, like other pharmaceutical drugs.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-11 20:28:59'] I wouldn’t; it’s priced in already. It may even go down more later as Novavax should have efficacy results in January (possibly mid-December) and their vaccine had the strongest immune response with sterilizing immunity in all the monkeys upper airways. It only needs normal fridge temps, has milder injection side effects, and potentially can be combined with their flu shot approved in March. So if NVAX comes out with >90% efficacy, it’ll be a clear front runner and may knock down the others a bit. Who knows how it’ll play out but for me there’s too big a chance of downside for PFE. And yes my NVAX shares are ready for some good results 🤞🏻
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-11 19:27:30'] Pfizer market cap is very high making it hard to move to begin with. Couple that with a huge billions float and outstanding shares, means that $1 price movement takes a lot of volume. Which is why moderna fluctuates a lot more with way lower float. Look at tesla, yes they are almost a trillion dollar company but their float and outstanding shares are lower than most similar large companies so price movements are more aggressive. Plus ppl sold the news and it gives ppl seizures lmao
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-11 22:50:10'] The vaccines are not about making much money, so they don’t necessarily translate to higher stock price, the vaccine is a two dose regimen, they have a large portfolio of medicine people take daily for life with a higher per dose profit margin. It is kinda like Mercedes winning a car race, it is about showing off their R&D chops rather than about making money directly.

	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:51:46'] Mainly that Pfizer is a massive company and this vaccine isn’t really a major source of consistent revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:31:53'] A textbook example of “buy the rumor, sell the news” that usually drives the market. It wasn’t just Pfizer today, it was all of the Dow and SP500 to some extent.Although, the supply chain issues that they expect to cut their delivery in half this month doesn’t help them.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:48:04'] pfizer is such a huge pharmaceutical company that the vaccine is just a drop in their bucket. I personally did not buy into PFE for this reason. and also the vaccine is questionable IMO.. but that's for a different sub
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:32:01'] My 2¢ is that there are several other vaccines coming, Pfizer will have a lot of competition, they can’t deliver enough to dominate the market in 2022. Lastly the Covid vaccine will be a relatively small part of their business overall.
	COMMENT: ['2020-12-14 13:53:19'] PFE is a long term guarantee. Everything right now V is just short squeezes or balances with the whole dow. Don’t stress pfe if you’re holding long term, I’m not.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 08:03:57'] They aren’t set to make massive profits from the vaccine, in comparison to the vast product catalog they have already. The vaccine will only be a small slice of the pie for them.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 12:29:14'] I bought in for the long term benefit. The vaccine is a small boost in the ocean but they have great long term profitability.I use Vanguard and Robinhood.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 11:38:05'] Pfizer is a huge company and even though they have great news on the Vaccine front, I don't think it's going to move the needle a lot on the stock price. Much of that is already "added in" to the price. I do think PFE will go up some, but not a lot.  I think there are better opportunities. Once a vaccine is approved, I think you'll see the stock prices of hotels, restaurants and casinos move much more than Pfizer.That said, I do own a few shares of Pfizer and I intend to hang on to them.&#x200B;As far as a trading platform:  I use Webull, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and Schwab.  I buy most of my value stocks on Fidelity, most of my Tech stocks on TD Ameritrade and most of my ETFs on Schwab. I have a few shares on Webull in an account that I opened just to see what the platform was like. I don't like it as well as the others.  I also had a RobinHood account for a while, but sold all of the shares I had in it. As for platforms, I like Fidelity the best and if I could only use one, that's the one I'd pick. However, if I traded a lot of options or if I did a lot of day trading, I might prefer Ameritrade for the ToS app.  I don't use the ToS app that much because I don't buy/sell on a daily basis and I prefer the research tools of Fidelity.  Fidelity is very user friendly and has a lot of valuable information on it.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 15:50:58'] Pull up a 20 year chart of Pfizer and you will see its share price has not moved much. Unless you are using it as an income play, it has very little share price appreciation potential.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 08:02:52'] Nope, it would be a long term play, but I get rich quick stock just because of the vaccine doesn’t make a whole lot of sense
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 15:40:47'] You say they were up 3%, but let's rephrase that.  They were up $6.5 billion in market cap, for something they will see very limited benefits from.  Don't buy now; also because of your comment in this thread asking if you should buy AMD... I think you really need to take a step back.  You need to teach yourself more before choosing individual stocks.  Stick to index funds.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 17:00:16'] I won't consider any pharma/biotech stocks. Way too much speculation in that industry and PFE has been sideways for a long time.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 07:53:42'] Yeah, tagging along.  I don’t get it either.  I bought and stock has gone down ever since.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 09:11:49'] Look at viastris, Pfizer stock kinda sucks
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 09:11:26'] Consider $JNJ instead because when their vaccine is approved, it should make $PFE's and $MRNA's obsolete. It only requires 1 does and doesn't need to be stored at very low temperatures. It's probably the one that will wind up at Walgreens and CVS.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 11:22:52'] Long term seems like a good investment with a nice dividend to add(interesting what's going to happen with tanezumab. If it gets approved that's going to be quite nice for Pfizer's bottom-line). The  vaccine stuff is definitely a plus but is unlikely to budge this stock that much anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 11:31:03'] I wouldn't own PFE over a total market fund like VTI. I doubt it will outperform the market since the vaccine will be sold at cost and likely be a small portion of a company like Pfizer's revenue.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 09:04:53'] The vaccine is irrelevant to the pharma companies.Most of them have committed to selling it at cost, or slightly above cost, and the problem with vaccines is that they are a one-shot deal.  The best case scenario is it becomes like a seasonal flu vaccine and people have to get it once/year.  That isn't anywhere near as profitable for these companies as drugs for chronic conditions, that you have to take daily for years/decades.  That's why most pharma companies have gotten out of the vaccine business altogether.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-20 09:09:13'] Stop looking to megacap pharma companies for vaccine plays. Any sort of vaccine won’t affect their stock prices at all.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-21 08:09:20'] The price will be slightly higher but will hover mid to high 30s through 2021.  Vaccine is a small fraction of PFE revenue. It can be sold on break even cost basis with the FDA contract.  There are also European and China developed vaccine available.  Many are already out.

	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 10:30:02'] I'm not sure whether or not it's reason behind dropping. Pfizer's COVID vaccine candidate has to be stored at -94F. It can last for only 24 hours between 35F and 46F. Pfizer argue that it's 48 hours. Anyway, it will face storage issues for sure at certain places.
	COMMENT: ['2020-09-01 11:56:44'] You should have never expected a boost from PFE for a vaccine, the stock price has been mostly flat for years. PFE are a gigantic company, around a billion from the government to make a vaccine they will never profit from long-term is almost meaningless to PFE. If you want a vaccine play look at BNTX, but certainly don't hope for a big change with PFE.

	COMMENT: ['2020-07-21 06:45:31'] Hold. Both are going up. PFE is back up a bit today. AZN will be back up, as well. I think both of them will see at least a 10% to 20% increase in stock prices over the next one to two months. Possibly more than that. Analysts have increased the target price on PFE to $53 from it's current price of near $37.  That's almost a 50% target price increase.

Let’s say a company finds a cancer drug from an orphan offer and buys them. Phase 1 shows they can help cancer patients survive up to 60 days more, stock shoots up 100%. Phase 2 shows it can also help cancer patients gain weight because they lose so much. Stock goes 200%. Phase 3 shows in reality patients only survive 1 week more and it doesn’t help with appetite.

	COMMENT: ['2019-09-02 06:17:03'] PFE because dividend
	COMMENT: ['2019-09-02 06:30:42'] I would say all three are buys currently when the health sector generally, and generics in particular, are weak. TEVA is certainly the riskiest due to its high debt. I am overweight in PFE, about 8%, and my plan is to buy in weakness and hold through the merger. I might buy a bit of MYL too, around $20, anticipating it will be closer to $25 by the merger. After the merger PFE should have better growth, the combined dividend of PFE and the new company should be the same as the old PFE dividend, and MYL will have a fresh start so I’ll stay in both at least for awhile. I wasn’t in PFE when they spun off ZTS but holding both was clearly the right call there....
	COMMENT: ['2019-09-02 06:44:05'] Currently holding pfe.
	COMMENT: ['2019-09-02 08:03:53'] It is all about future. After merger changes, PFE will still be stronger and longer stable life. With low price and long dividend history, I prefer PFE.  It is buy now.Regarding TEVA, debt is big burden and may come out of it after 2019 year.  considering very low price, when it dips buy. I buy this considering low P/S.  MYL, I do not consider this when I buy/own PFE.BTW: I own both TEVA (buying when dips now) and PFE (bought already).
	COMMENT: ['2019-09-02 09:08:06'] I wouldnt touch healthcare, a lot of uncertainty heading into election. TEVA has been getting kicked in the balls. Long running trend of generic price deflation doesn't appear to be an end in site. However, eventually GRx deflation will moderate which will be the time to buy TEVA. Same deal with MYLAN.
	COMMENT: ['2019-09-02 09:17:07'] Pfizer and Mylan are both attractive but I’d stay away from Teva unless one wanted to wait for the stock price to drop even further; it’s possible we could see a Mylan / Upjohn like merger or a buyout — both of  which would be a big boost for Teva and a win for investors who bought the dip. Pfizer highlights:1.) A healthy 3.4% yield2.) Relatively clean balance sheet3.) Pfizer has managed to stay (mostly) out of the water on opioid epidemic lawsuits and thus legal expenses and repercussions that have pummeled other pharmaceutical stocks like Mallinckrodt (MNK), and Teva for that matter, have been avoided.  I would categorize Allergan’s recent lawsuit against Pfizer differently than an “opioid epidemic” related case. 4.) Best management out of the three; look at the recent R&D turnaround story as an example.[Pfizer R&D Turnaround ](https://www.lifescienceleader.com/doc/the-story-of-pfizer-s-r-d-turnaround-0001) d.) Shedding Upjohn has been met unenthusiastically by investors but I think the reaction is over done. Spinning off generics makes sense. The risk of diluting PFE’s share price is, however, a real one.e.) PFE is trading at relatively reasonable multiples due to recent market-cap losses as a reaction to the Mylan / Upjohn deal. —— Mylan is the only other reasonable choice in my view.  The primary risk is that generic manufacturers continue to face troubles and political uncertainty.  Nonetheless, I view the Upjohn deal as more of a win for Mylan than a win for Pfizer. This sentiment, which seems to be shared by the market and thus already priced in,  makes it less attractive.——The only reason I would buy Teva is if it were to get even cheaper.  The biggest potential tailwind catalyst for Teva’s stock performance would be for it to get taken over in a buyout. It has lost hundreds of millions to battling opioid epidemic settlements and legal expenses. The past few years have not been the brightest for Teva.  It’ financials are not as healthy as Pfizer’s either. ——Political uncertainty is a risk factor for the entire sector as far as I’m concerned, and I’ve been avoiding any stocks particularly exposed to political risk until after the 2020 election. There could be major overhauls in the entire healthcare system and big changes in regard to pharmaceuticals. Regardless of changes in policy, Teva has a lot of work to do to rebuild the prominence it once had.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-25 17:35:05'] That article is a bit out of date - for example, it references the Upjohn segment, which has since been unloaded by PFE and is now a separate company.When people talk about if a company is over/undervalued, there's a few models they might be using. The more complicated one is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model which adds up all the company's future earnings based on various assumptions and compares to what the market prices the company at today based on the stock price.A simpler, more approachable model you could use for your assignment is the Dividend Growth model - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.aspYou could also compare various valuation metrics of PFE (the P/E ratio, Price/Sales, etc) against other companies in its industry and use that to make an argument that its over or undervalued.

So now you’re looking for a company with a vaccine in phase 3 plus good scientific evidence that it’s going to be better either in efficacy or safety than Pfizer or Moderna.IMO, you’re better off making plays on companies set to recover thanks to the vaccine, like another response said. If you’re looking for a short play, imo look elsewhere

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-13 11:18:47'] Lowes is less than 3% yield, but they have increased their dividend every year for that last 60 years and has seen good growth and has room to grow by taking market share from Home Depot.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-13 12:34:24'] Texas Instruments (TXN)They have been getting hit due to the massive semi-conductor sell off from NVDA, AMD, and INTC. Dividend yield is greater then 3% which is higher then its historical average. Been paying a dividend for decades straight and have been increasing it for 18 years now. Solid balance sheet, look at their current assets and long term debt. Its honestly insane. They have basically no debt. Solid cash flow as well as buying back shares. They are doing over 20 billion dollars in share buybacks this year.Honorable mention: Lockheed Martin (LMT)

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-13 11:14:41'] I'd have said the bank I used to work at, First Interstate Bank. But its price right now is actually relatively high. It's a boring small to mid sized bank centered in Montana and Wyoming. Dividend hit 5% when the stock dropped to 33 earlier this year. The price is now 44 and the dividend is just below 4%.The stock is actually up 4.5% in the past year and that's with a 4%™ dividend.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 04:57:19'] It feels like a sell off over a new variant is a huge overreaction. We have almost two years of experience with this now.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-25 21:05:44'] I'm not that worried given that:* We were going to have a giant spike anyways with or without this new variant. Lots of people relaxing on masks and distancing already thanks to holiday season. * There's no indication that this affects vaccine protection against death and hospitalization. * Once the viral therapeutics are ready to go early next year then transmission doesn't matter as much.* This might actually be good for tech stocks given that tech is less affected by covid-related supply chain issues. * Powell said covid is a key factor he looks at for rate hikes. If this variant causes some concern it may push back rate hikes to mid 22 or even late 22.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 00:51:00'] The coming trading day will show everyone how positive or negative the market is. Futures aren't looking good:S&P 500 futures are down 4.7%  compared to 5 days ago.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 05:32:50'] As a scientist, I think this is shit. South Africa is speculating about transmissibility and that the mutations escape the vaccines. NO LAB WORK HAS BEEN DONE! No strain on their health system yet, just cluster outbreaks. If they do the lab work then I’ll believe them. But vaccine still worked well against delta and now we have anti virals. Just because you have mutations doesn’t mean that viral fitness has improved until you prove it. I’ll be buying the dip.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 02:51:24'] .... Buy the dipand hope it won't keep on dippingBecause these are the stats and speculations:* 7.5 billion vaccines were administered worldwide (in a year basically)* Recorded infections are quite rare among vaccinated people, compared to unvaccinated people, so this is really becoming the problem of the unvaccinated more* With speedy roll-outs of vaccines, it's realistic to see all of the people who want to get vaccinated, get 3 doses, within the next year.The new variant will be something that everybody speaks about, it will put more people in hospitals, will affect vaccinated people even more, but it's still going to be OK. This is the world recovering from the pandemic. It isn't sudden, it isn't at a snap of the fingers, but this is happening. COVID-19 is just yesterday's news that's still causing echoes.The only long-term risks that are obvious right now is players with bad intentions on the global scene. Dictatorships try to undermine free societies, so they sow fear, doubt, disinformation, while strengthening their own positions. I can't shake the worry that at some point they might spread their wings and do some damage to neighbours (aside from indirectly killing millions by sowing disinformation about how vaccines are bad).

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 08:35:53'] People here are really weird about coronavirus. This new variant has a concerning number of spike mutations, according to WHO. Also, the percentage of new variant cases is significantly higher at this stage since detection compared to this stage since detecting delta. It could be more contagious than delta, and it could be vaccine resistant.I don't think this is an overreaction. We're talking about potential shutdowns and another race to develop a new vaccine. It'll be a long while before we know anything for sure, but it could potentially be worse than what we've already dealt with.

The olden days of *checks notes* a few months ago, when Delta was going to destroy the planet and everyone would be back under total lockdowns in just two weeks.Then everyone got bored with the story and the media forget about it in about a month. So my thoughts are this will cause mass panic and hysteria for 2 weeks. Be a topic of deep concern for another two. Probably cause a big push for Christmas to be canceled, which will be almost universally ignored. And then in early January totally forgotten about.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 03:10:20'] My questuon is: how is this related to other existing variants? Aside from the handful of big COVID variants, there are countless other offshoots of these and other mutations. If this is something that's showing an increasing prevalence compared to something like delta, I'd maybe be a bit cautious. If its being found in other countries, that's probably a cause for concern.If, however, the proportions in the population are staying somewhat stable, and it's not spreading globally, I'd probably not be too worried.To add to that, concerning disease outbreaks are a dime a dozen, and probably never affect the markets.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-26 09:59:27'] Short-term panic. We all knew that new variants would arise over time. I think that most public health agencies have accepted that the world will be dealing with new variants for the foreseeable future. I doubt that this is going to send the world back into lockdown mode; countries are going to learn to deal with the new variants as a part of normal life. Also, I expect that oral antivirals that will shortly be widely used around the world should drastically reduce Covid hospitalizations and (most importantly) deaths. While we got a disappointing update from Merck today, the final data set still indicated 90% reduction in mortality; Pfizer's antiviral combination results indicated 100% reduction in mortality^(1) I just bought a SPY call debit spread expiring mid-January. It was down 15% for the day when I bought it.&#x200B;^(1. (0 deaths in treatment group, consisting of \~600 people; I think it's safe to say that some deaths will be observed despite use of the Pfizer antiviral once it's being broadly used, but overall I imagine the mortality reduction rate of both Pfizer and Merck antivirals will be around 90%).)

If you know markets you don’t follow the narrative you follow the money and all of a sudden things become really clear. Anyways a little story to sleep on with Christmas approaching. Jesus Christ was killed in cold blooded murder but to avoid penalty for the killing the men that did it created a story book that said the killing was justified and Jesus would come back and save everyone. He hasn’t come back yet but that book and the hillbillies that created it went on to make tons of money and own the most land in the world.

He is essentially the  only major hedge fund manager employing a traditional value investing strategy. Most others at this point are using more complex leveraged/quant/algorithmic trading strategies. He has been right more often than wrong. The SPAC was a disaster, but it’s not his fault people hyped the expectations so much, and we don’t know the final outcome of it yet. I have never had any money in PSTH, but it was by definition speculative and the current value rests exactly at its intrinsic and original value of $20.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 14:28:50'] those are called "Blue Chip Stocks", not "Boomer Stocks." apart from Tesla. Blue Chips are large, stable, dominant dividend-paying companies. generally speaking, they're very good investments. not too exciting, but they plug along slow and steady and do their thing very well. keep the oil stocks. keep them all IMO.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 13:34:33'] The fact that you called these Boomer stocks gives me pause about your investing judgment. Since they were free and you inherited their current (relatively low) prices as basis, I don’t see why you wouldn’t keep all of them.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 02:48:57'] Keep Tesla for 15 years, then sell when you retire. This is the highest growth stock in your portfolio, and in 15 years, your oil stocks may diminish(the world is turning green), whilst TESLA (EVs, Energy) will likely be the incumbent.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 13:35:18'] Keep them all. And especially don’t sell Tesla. And I say that unironically. Someone knew what they were doing with these, especially the TSLA. See it as a hedge to what you invest in (in the same way I see and appreciate my crappy 401k investments as a hedge to my picks).
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 13:48:20'] Why would you sell any of it?
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-22 15:12:26'] Depending on how many of each you ended up with I would keep them all and top them off to quantities of at least 100, enough to sell options on them. You would be able to collect the dividends too. So if you have 100 shares of Tesla for whatever reason that could make you around $1000-$2000 in premiums weekly depending on the strike prices chosen. In the grand scheme of things those are all really solid time tested companies though except Tesla of course. I have no idea how many of each you have and you may end up with a short term gains tax bill every year but the amount you will make on premiums alone could be monumental. Just make sure to stuff away 30% of those premiums in a high interest savings account. Something like SOFI offers. I think they have the best interest rate on the market currently.

When you've paid off the loan, you STILL have your money-generating assets.But whatever, do NOT dispose of FREE assets you were given that put money into your pocket.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-23 12:26:58'] Not a bad portfolio. However, it was for an older person as dividend payments were clearly involved in choosing. I would sell them and put it all into S&P 500 index ETF like VOO. That way you diversify more so, and just have dividends reinvested. It is best to let that money compound instead of taking the dividends and spending them.

Can I just keep the stock and maybe have it continue to grow? The stock has grown a lot since I bought it at like 6 a share or something like that.\n\nDo I simply get cash or can I get pfizer stock or something like an instore coupon?\n\nDo you guys have any general advice for me?\n\nAppreciate any help thanks a lot!!"
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-20 23:56:24'] Have you tried to see if Google has the deal details listed anywhere? From my experience a merger offers you a share conversation (example: for every share you own of company x, you will get 1.5 of the new company or in the case that it's less than a whole share, they credit your account for that). My guess is you'll probably end up with some shares in Pfizer if you don't take the cash offer now but I could be wrong as I didn't look anything up on the deal or hear about so sorry if any of this is wrong.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-20 23:20:22'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-20 23:58:21'] Usually, the tender offer is automatically accepted unless you specifically state you don't want to participate. I don't know of a reason to not accept the offer; I don't know how you would sell your stock after the fact (and if you can't sell it, it's really worth nothing).What you get depends on the terms of the deal. It looks like it's a straight up cash deal (you will receive cash). You can also sell now if you want to invest in something with a higher return than what you would get by waiting for the offer to close.
	COMMENT: ['2019-07-22 18:36:34'] I am in the same situation. Something to consider,  I bought my shares through ALLY and when I spoke with them about taking the $48 offer, they said I would be charged a $50 fee for accepting the tender offer. They said  it would be better to just sell my stocks  at the current price rather than taking their offer as I'd only be charged the $4.95 fee of selling all my shares.

At this PE ratio, this seems like a no brainer stock.This is a perfect example of how PE only makes sense in context.  PE is based on the *last* twelve months.  If the entire future of the company doesn't look like the last 12 months, PE isn't that telling.Don't you expect Moderna, one of the major Covid vaccine makers, to have done better in the last year than they will in their average future years?
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-16 13:17:40'] MRNA are a $50-75/share company until proven otherwise.  It will only go down from here until a new product is released.  There is promise for the future pipeline (maybe), but not at these prices.  No retail investor should have been holding their COVID play.COVID made MRNA greedy and they mismanaged that capital.  They have proven they're too stubborn to do a licensing or partnership deal, unlike PFE.  They're too slow to update existing COVID vaccines for latest mutations, despite the promise it could be done within 4-6 weeks.Great, they're talking about cancer vaccines again.  They've been doing that for 15+ years under a whole host of names and scientists.  I'm skeptical it will work.  Waning efficacy has been a persistent problem with mRNA technology in every single study.It will likely become personalized in some capacity, eventually, in the future... but we're stuck with the FDA roadblocks that will make that 15-20+ years away.  I'm not waiting 15+ years for ROI on MRNA.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 06:46:04'] I would strongly recommend looking into Dividend Aristocrats if you are wanting to build steady, long term dividend growth. The companies that are considered dividend aristocrats have a long history of consistent dividend increases. Just remember to pick the company based on more than just having a high dividend yield. A company giving an 18% dividend isn’t very good if the stock loses 50% of its value. Also if you don’t need the money right away and your brokerage platform allows it I highly recommend making sure you have dividend reinvestment turned on. This way your dividend income will increase without you even trying.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 06:51:51'] r/dividends is pretty good if your looking for recommendations. Also remember higher dividend yield is not always good. Make sure to look at the free cash flow statement and see how much they are making and how much they are paying out to investors in the form of dividends. A lot of companies will try to entice investors with a higher yield but not be able to afford it. Here is a list of the dividend aristocrats as a starting point in research.https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/dividend-stocks-aristocratsYou can tell high quality companies if they gave a decent yield while not having to big of payout ratio and also doing share buybacks at the same time. For example LMT has a decent yield of almost 3% while paying less then half their cash towards their dividend. They use the rest of the money for share buybacks and investing back in the business. Obviously do your own research, the list and the sub is just a starting point. Good luck!

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 06:31:47'] You should consider that the fastest way for someone your age to build a dividend income is not to buy them when you're young.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 12:05:05'] Focus on buying companies with solid fundamentals instead of strictly dividends.  When a dividend is paid, the value of a stock decreases by the same amount of the payment.  If it’s a good company, this is in your favor, but if it’s a poorly run company, the dividend doesn’t actually add value.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 09:25:28'] My general thought is that a company that pays out dividends is saying "we think you can put this money to better use than we can".  And maybe that's appropriate for non-growth companies.  With a long term investment horizon, I would focus more on growth potential.

Qsr is another solid choice. You still have a 50% volatility range but it's a business pretty much all of us can understand that isn't going away. Lmt is another

A lot of the traditional big market disease states (cholesterol, blood pressure, non insulin dependent diabetics) can be treated quite cheaply with old generics that work really damn well.  Take Lipitor (atorvastatin, a pfeizer drug) for example, the local grocery store pharmacy gives the generic away for free.  And a lot of "new drugs" these companies come out with are garbage and ripe for being throat punched as scrutiny around health care costs intensify.  Take "Duexis" for example.  That is ibuprofen (advil) and famotidine (pepcid) packaged in a combination tablet. --I mean ground breaking stuff right?  Both drugs have been out since Armstrong walked on the moon.  And it costs a fortune and some how some insurances and state medicaids have been conned into paying for it.  Granted that is not a pfizer med, but it's an example of some of the shit companies without a really good innovative pipeline are doing.  So I guess in short, are they making a difference?  What good ideas do they have?

It could be dark times next year and possibly in 2024, too.  Just be prepared for your investments to possibly be worth less in 2024.  And remember: housing is much more stable.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-16 02:30:51'] Hi, I don´t want to be rude or anything, but these "another potential PLTR customer" kind of posts are ridiculous. PLTR is overpriced, they are selling at 48x of their revenue and not earning any profit. Let´s assume that everything goes right and they are going to double their revenue for 2-3 years, the price should not move upwards because it´s already priced in. Their TTM FCF is 97.5 million (Source: YF), so this means that right now their cap is  500x of FCF. There is no rational reason to expect growth in the next few years. They have to catch up first.EDIT: Growth of stock price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-16 07:30:34'] I agree C and INTC are cheap. But I’m not willing to invest heavily into either of those businesses YET. In my humble opinion, they’re both turnarounds. They both messed up badly under their previous CEO’s, and brought in new CEO’s to turn things around. And like Peter Lynch said, I’d like to see real evidence of them turning around before I really invest in them.I look at C like the 4th best pizzeria in a town with 4 pizzerias. Even if they’re selling their business to me at a cheap price, I don’t think I want to buy the worst one in town. I would rather wait until they become maybe the 2nd best in town, even if it means I would have to pay more at the point. I look at INTC like the big old store in town that keeps losing customers to the newer stores that opened up in town. Sure, it’s still bigger, making more money, and I can buy it cheap. But I don’t know if I wanna buy a store that keeps losing its customers. I would rather wait and if I see them gaining their lost customers back, I’ll buy that store, even if it means I have to pay more at that point.I know many people would disagree with me and that’s fine. We all have different styles of investing. This is just what I’m personally more comfortable with.Edit: Forgot to say, kudos to you, OP. You put a lot of work into researching. I love to see that.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-16 14:49:53'] Price to sales is gonna be higher when profit margins increase. Not a great metric.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-16 17:43:05'] This by itself not a great metric. Look at EV/sales and EV/EBITDA together if anything. I think the concern here, is if margins start to fall, then yes we’ll see contraction.

Anyway, they were discussing how viral loads were found everywhere the patient had touched with the heaviest viral load on door knobs and in the bathroom. Considering there's a large subset of Americans who resist hygiene and public health measures as an assault on their freedom to be dirty and ignorant, it's reasonable to imagine monkey pox becoming a greater health challenge than covid - very quickly.

POST_TEXT: b"I've been holding $ARNA for years and today Pfizer announced they would be buying us out for 100$/share cash deal. I'm totally new to buyouts so I am confused as to what's the best move here. If I buy at market open at $95 is that just a guaranteed 5% increase for when the sale goes through?\n\nShould I just sell my position now?\n\nDo I just do nothing?\n\nDo my shares just turn into Pfizer shares?\n\nAny help/info is greatly appreciated!"
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 06:16:07'] Depends if it’s an all stock or all cash deal. If all cash youll likely get the $100/share. If it’s all stock then youll get Pfizer shares depending on the ratio for 1 arna stock to Pfizer. If you can get some at 95 then sure although I see it spiking past 95 at open. My suggestion would be to sell. Mergers can take a bit of time to complete.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 06:25:23'] The arena buyout is a cash deal. You’ll get $100 per share.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 08:21:13'] Given that it looks like the stock jumped up 80% and is close to the buyout price I'd probably just sell.Only reason to wait imo would be if you're very close to having held your shares for a full year, since long term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. But it really depends on what your tax rate is for how much benefit there is there. You can easily google a capital gains tax calculator to figure it out.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 08:03:02'] Cash out. Congratulations
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 11:07:52'] Mimecast announced a $80 a share buyout. I put in a $79 limit sell, and got rid of it for 79.39. I took a 44% profit, and now someone else is taking the risk of the deal falling through for 61 cents a share, the last remaining .76% of profit to be had.Looks like ARNA is trading at about 89% of buyout value. Is the last 11% worth the risk of the deal falling through to you?If yes, hold. If not, take profit.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 10:12:55'] this really created the perfect sell opportunity (that you should take)...
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 14:41:04'] Well to those lucky bastards who woke up this morning congrats. And fuck you
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 13:08:42'] I would wait until the New Year to sell so I could better manage the tax implications from potential capital gains unless you had a lot of losses this year.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 15:26:36'] I’d say sell now. Most of the times the market will have the price range a little below the buyout price until the deal actually goes through. Most of the times getting the deal done takes months, the reward for holding till then is meagre. And the prospect of a renewed offer is off the table from my perspective considering that the premium offered is 100%. Sell now and pocket the win. If you have tax free profit limits, this could be used for it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 06:13:28'] Sell sell sell sell
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 13:34:00'] You could hold and see if some morons pump it. I sold LVGO last year for over $140, (TDOC merger) deal should have made shares worth around $105. I held and sold near the top for extra profit. I was totally shocked that it ran that high.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 12:15:10'] PFE bought out my stock in TRIL. It took a few months, and as it got closer and more assured the price finally met the buy out price. I sold covered calls for higher than the buyout price and that was like free money IMO, so I would suggest doing that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 13:05:59'] On watches and whiskey, they both hold their value better
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 13:43:15'] Hey I just went through this with $STMP (Stamps).  They went private from a buyout.  So what I learned was yes, it would be a 5% increase, from your example. ONLY if the deal goes through.  If the deal falls apart its a whole new ballgame.  That's what you'd be betting on buy buying at $95.I didn't do anything and eventually, all my shares were liquidated and I was credited with cash for the purchase of my shares.  You should be getting mail/email discussing how the deal will be tailored.  You may get Pfizer shares or they could just pay you cash for the ARNA shares.  Have to read up on it.
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-13 19:54:35'] Buyout could fail for 300 reasons. Set a limit order for either just under, or just over the offered price. Sit back and wait for someone to pay that much.If you think it's worth more, set a limit order for 10-20% more, but just know that analysts that think XYZ$ company is worth that much are probably not right, or maybe they are but nobody's willing to pay that much now that it's been priced at 100 per share.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 12:03:16'] Even if it does go to 500 or even $550, it’s at 480 right now, after a huge run up. You’re speaking from a place of FOMO and you need to recognize that line of thinking so you don’t get yourself in trouble. You missed the boat. If anything, if you think there is future potential for it and buy on a red day after a correction
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:22:02'] I feel FOMO. It's time to sell, not to buy
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 12:12:41'] Long term it's probably going up.  Short term it's probably going down.  But the fact that you didn't buy when it retraced to 310 from 350 means you shouldn't buy the stock since that was one of the best entry points for someone waiting for a pull back.  If that didn't look juicy enough to pull the trigger nothing will.  I would say look for something else you believe in enough to put your capital in.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:32:51'] This can be easily avoided with a simple plan. Just buy a few and if it continues to rise buy a few more and it’ll keep your cost basis lower and put a stop loss on it or just hold and if it drops you pyramid in with larger buys since you only bought a few but make sure you look for levels and even then look at the indicators like CCI and Stochastics. If you don’t know how these work take a class. It’s worth it. Saving a $1-$3 per share can make a big difference on your cost basis.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 14:50:16'] Buying in after a stock has gone "parabolic" is the worst thing to do. Wait for a pullback or better yet go short on the way down then long again.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:28:18'] I bought at $63 and sold at $70.  Because “the vaccine windfall is already priced in”Back in at $332.  Not selling
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 11:42:09'] I’m holding at a $155 cost basis. I did sell some in my Roth IRA and used it to buy BNTX, so I’m planning to hold on to both.MRNA has sold 199 million doses as of earnings (Q2 from last Thursday), with projected sales of 2-3 billion by the end of 2022. They also have another vaccine (RSV) that was granted FDA fast track, and their CMV vaccine is in phase 3 clinical trials.They have many other vaccines and personalized cancer treatments in their pipeline too.COVID is expected to become endemic, so COVID shots will be a regular thing like the flu. They are also looking into creating a 4-in-1 “respiratory vaccine” which includes COVID, flu, hMPV, and RSV, which would be taken annually, which could help sustain profits and fund research in the pipeline. They started collaborating with outside partners for an HIV vaccine, have Epstein-Barr in the pipeline (virus that causes mono), and have a vaccine of a potential contagion-like virus in early stages of research (Nipah if you’re curious)I was hesitant before, but now I plan to buy more, they crushed earnings and still have a lot of doses to go. Their P/E ratio went from about 280 to about 45 before opening today, and their profits grew by 1272% over a year (technically very undervalued compared to the P/E, but stock only has been around for 2 years, so take it with a grain of salt). I also believe biotech will revolutionize medicine in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:50:27'] bought at 49 , sold at 259 literally moments before they started running up on S&P inclusion news.  :( I'm holding out for a pullback before buying back in.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 16:55:25'] Don’t fall victim to FOMO and chase. The market provides endless opportunities
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:07:03'] I would sell a put option instead. I've found this to be a cure for FOMO and I may do it with MRNA. I bought at $20 before many people in the USA had heard of the virus, and sold at $46. I thought the vax winners would be the big names - Pfizer, Astra, J&J etc. Not this upstart. I console myself that I surely would've taken profits months ago. Anyway, you sell a put option which obligates you to buy 100 shares at whatever strike price you select, if the stock price is below that point on expiration date. For example, you could sell the 9/17 put with strike price of $360 for $6.35 ($635 since its 100 shares). So, no matter what, you get paid $635. If the stock is above $360 in six weeks, nothing happens and you have $635 in your pocket. If it's below $360 on 9/17, you buy 100 shares at $360. That's a 25% discount to today. If you like the stock at $480 you'd love it at $360.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 14:43:03'] That's 17% jump is nuts! I'd at least wait for a pull back before establishing a position.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 15:24:49'] Time to take profits is upon FDA permanent approval of their vax.   That is what I am waiting for… in under 30 and watching ever since
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-10 02:47:50'] Never wait for a correction unless you have specific information that suggests it's very likely to happen based on some event. Otherwise, just buy. Good companies are at or near ATH almost always as long as the markets are at or near ATHs. If you think it's a good company, chances are larger than 50% it will be higher tomorrow than today.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 10:40:02'] It would probably be better to go for a pick and shovel biotech play at these valuations. If you believe that mRNA technology is going to be important, and you're going to see some advances in the biotech field over the next 10+ years, names like TMO and DHR will be important, I think.But then, I'm kicking myself for finding TMO interesting and then blowing it off because I felt like it might be too intertwined with COVID, and at that time I felt that we were in good enough shape there as a country. It's ran quite a bit and even though it's at a more reasonable value, it's hard for me to buy something that's up 20%+ in the last near two months.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 10:35:12'] Depends on if you think the company will be worth more in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:40:46'] I'd just buy it and keep it. They just got authorization in Australia; my family is in Europe and they strongly prefer to get Moderna or Pfizer. They're making boosters, etc. etc.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 13:16:59'] I thought the same with Biontech watching when it was at its ATH around 230 a few weeks ago. In the end I still got in at 350 and have now out a stop loss to at least break even.

I finally bought more Friday and it is up $70 in one day. I still think it has to come back down after that, but I’ve been wrong every time so far. Who knows.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 17:31:16'] Well they are expected to produce $30 in earnings in 2022 so I would say maybe overpriced for the industry but maybe not if they can develop other vaccines or cures to diseases.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 19:00:44'] Theirs always another trade...
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 19:03:18'] It’ll come back down, unless mRNA is pricing in Covid-30,-31 and -32.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-09 19:47:33'] Buy some cost average in further.  Moderna and biontech will continue to outperform as covid and mrna technology are here to stay .  Hopefully the applications to cancer treatments will be promising as well.   I’m also holding on to novavax but that has been a roller coaster .

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\n\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last weeks volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserves latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum.

POST_TEXT: b'**Summary**\n\nThe three day rally in the stock market took a pause, with stocks finishing mostly lower. Market participants continue to digest new data about the Omicron variant, the Weekly Unemployment Report, and look forward to new inflation data being released tomorrow. Weekly unemployment claims showed lowest level since 1969 with 184k claims vs 220k expected.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the risks of Omicron infections, with mixed news about the severity of illness and its response to vaccines. Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant. However, reports continue to suggest the severity of the disease is less than originally feared and new early lab results from Pfizer (PFE) showed a third booster shot neutralizes the variant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/o'

And very few people actually believe interest rates are going back up. First argument is always that the load of government debt is too heavy, and the second that it is the course of history for interest rates to lower.

Moderna has recently secured additional orders for their COVID vaccine from EU, UK and Israel.  Those are tremendous votes of confidence for their vaccine.  I estimate their revenues to be at least $7.5B in 2021 and net earnings at least at $3B.  They have 20 other products in the development pipeline.  I predict stock price between $150 and $225.  See my 10-minute deep-dive YouTube video on Moderna:  [Moderna Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4G3FNDDg5Q&t=49s)The messenger RNA technology will change the pharmaceutical industry forever.

It also has shelf stability problems, and needs to be kept in near freezing conditions during transport. Even jostling can disrupt the chemistry, if I'm not mistaken.Unfortunately I can't find the full Zanny Minto + Bill Gates interview where Bill Gates explains that the RNA approach won't be manufacturable in time for this pandemic, but he does comment here starting at 2:35 that the Astra Zenena, JnJ and Novavax vaccines have the low marginal cost of production necessary to actually make a shitload of the vaccine.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwjt9EoWhcg&t=306s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwjt9EoWhcg&t=306s)I doubt the market will care about the truth though LMAOOOO

Sure you could research it, but you'll remember the little things way better if you have real money on the line. Pick an amount that you are okay losing 100% of and start from there.

So if there is any decline or inaction due to the Delta variant, then the stock will tank. Side effects, tank. People prefer Coke over Pepsi, tank. The stock has run up so much, that the higher it goes, the more fragile the volitility. People are looking for reasons and signs to dump stocks as of late. Institutional money is moving out of the market, and its propped up by retail investors which tend to be more emotional than technical traders.Just gotta take profit at some point. It can't go up forever.

No one with actual money makes a decision based on one other guy's opinion, ever - they all do their own research and may reach the sameconclusion.

The market is attempting to correct its irrational over-exuberance.Your market analysis need to go beyond, a BofA analyst publishing a paper "\[caused\] the biggest drop in the stock since May 2020"!!

But that threat was short lived and then the stock started to increase again. As Moderna has proven to be the best and most effective vaxx, the share price has risen in recognition of this. Then it went parabolic so the big drop down the next couple days is not so surprising as that surge did not look sustainable. Since u bought the stock at its high, I would hold on to it if u think the price will rebound. Personally i would hate that i bought it at the top if i were u but i think i would hold for the very long term and it can be painful. Or you could buy some at the sub 400 price and DCA.

The Dow Jones (DIA) closed higher after its worst day since October 2020, as the price of oil, which suffered its worst day all year, somewhat rebounded. While it is way too early to make any conclusions, I am personally looking at this dip as a potential buying opportunity in equities that were overstretched before.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients, Ultimately this is not the first or last variant scare and our tech playbook over the last 18 months has been to use these macro/risk-off events as buying opportunities to own the tech sector specifically cloud, cyber-security, and 5G winners.

This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. \n\nSince the depths of the pandemic, the Fed'

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-15 16:47:57'] Think we cleared the major stuff now. What a huge reaction to Powell announcement! Few of my stocks were down 10% in the morning then reversed and ended up 15% -> over 25% daily range. Just insane stuff.Debt ceiling can't be used as a pretext to fuck with the market till \~2023. The next Covid variants should have weaker effect on the market.There's still inflation and supply chain, and some China evergrande, but better outlook for now. It'll be interesting to see how the market reacts when the rates hikes actually happen. I think we can have semi-trust in the strong reaction given how so many sectors and indices had large pullbacks.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). \n\nWith roughly 89% of companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. \n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/'

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 09:27:56'] Unpopular opinion:  Most "technical analysis" is bullshit.  Especially RSI.Take a look at AMZN chart from last year.  RSI was 71.6 on April 14th.  Overbought right?  Should probably sell right?  Except the stock kept moving up and up and up despite the RSI being consistently in the 70s and at times the 80s.  The stock moved up 5 more months despite the RSI saying it was overbought in April.If you would have sold in April you would have missed out on a massive bull run.  Long story short...don't base your trades on things like RSI or you will miss out on huge profits.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 08:54:14'] I also use RSI and others like MACD to look for technical entry points. For the long term it probably doesn't make much of a difference but I think it's a good spot check not to jump in at the top. This market is just eerily familiar to 1999-2000, and even 2005-2007, at least to me. Still, I buy and hold stocks, though I try to steer clear of absurdly priced issues. Most of my portfolio is in cash and bonds for now.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 09:14:56'] I've noticed the same thing -- I use RSI and MACD as additional confirmation indicators, but sometimes it seems a stock (especially a new 'hot' one can ride above that 70 easily for a week or more.   When I see that, I consider it to be the "new 70" if it continues to trade that way.  The RSI does adjust to that new trading level over time does it not (ie, does the indicator adjust for that price level over time)?
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 10:14:12'] I don’t find RSI to be a particularly helpful indicator, especially when you are already scanning a list of top performers. Everyone knows we’re in a bubble, but it’s unclear how it can end. The fed’s plan is hyperinflation/stagflation. Everything is a sacrifice to prop the market up, because it’s the only thing they can point to and say “see the economy is actually good”.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 15:10:52'] When people pumped more money in the market the last 5 months than the last 12 years, a lot of stuff are overvalued and overbought.  The case of that market deli can attest to that.  Right I am seeing a lot of correction albeit more gradually than sharply like the last 2 months.  I think most of those money already rotated to blue chips and index .  The new money are going mostly to Crypto.

TA is for *finding* the pattern that whales of the day are using, not for fitting the lines to your preferred indicator. This is basic data analysis. RSI and MACD are fairly useless, simple moving averages are your time tested friend for entry/exit. Beyond that the golden rule is don't get greedy, take your profits when they become meaningful.

But when shit like doge is mooning , gme , whatever , there’s just way too much retail money without a clue. this summer could be ugly for the market with reopenings that go better than expected and we see jobs come back . Too pussy to short , but sell in may and go away .
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-16 19:28:03'] It has been signaling overbought for quite some time. If you look though, even Buffett said it's not the only indicator to use.We will most likely remain overbought for at least half the year before any kind of major downturn.  It's more likely the fundamentals will catch up to the price rather than the price going down to the fundamentals.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 11:11:13'] Guys the underlying thing I see here is that the news of the vaccine is causing the market to rise (expected but by a huge amount) over its actual application to the real world: it's actual value.Isn't it strange how that just the news of something will cause stocks to rise so much over a market's actual performance? I know this is purely anecdotal but let's say your unemployed right now and you get a vaccine. Then what? Was the business you were employed with supported? In a lot of cases no, so the option to return is no longer there.In my mind a vaccine does not necessarily mean recovery or a magical rebound. Why is the market treating it as if it is? The idea of the economy recovering within next year is laughable in my mind but I guess stocks only go up now!

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-28 11:28:33'] The ATHM ticker gives me PTSD from the tech boom.  At home was one of the most pumped stocks before the crash... back when ISPs were a thing.  People didnt know where the money was going to be made so they piled in to anything tech related.  I didn’t invest in it (it was hard to buy stock back then) but it was on my watch list...which got completely murdered during the crash.  I liked CSCO, ATHM, IBM, INTC.  I was so wrong.Turns out the answer was Amazon.  It’s easy to see today, but it was hard to see back then.  People were too focused on near term profitability, not long term profitability.  So people were willing to spend a premium on low growth scaling investments if they had a decent P/E.  Sound familiar?So every time I hear someone compare TSLA’s current P/E to F, or BRK is gives me a tourettes-like tic.  Just because a company makes money today doesn’t mean they will own the next decade.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-09 11:30:00'] I would not look too much into today's price action. I think some WFH stocks may be in for a bit of a hit, like the Home Depots and Lowe's that benefitted from the housing/renovation boom. But other tech will be fine - the digital transformation is not going to suddenly reverse course. If you own BABA or other big tech companies, there is no reason to panic. In fact, if this sell-off lasts a few days, it would be a good move to add a little to your position.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-09 11:42:21'] I closed several of my positions at today's peak, now waiting for the market to correct itself and then buy back into the stocks I had.  I'm still fairly new - what do you think about that? It's kind of timing the market, but I think it's also making the best out of an opportunity, right? Overall, my investments made a rise of 10% today. Feels odd to just leave it and see everything drop down again.  Did that with my Lufthansa stocks when they went from 7 to 12 in a day and deeply regretted not listening to my gut and close the positions.

Is literally all tech.You’re not wrong in terms of this advice but I’d hesitate to call you right in any of your reasoning. Yes, there are a lot of factors in play but you have to realize that the market expectation just shifted from “we may have a somewhat effective vaccine” to “we likely will have a very vaccine”. That is huge.Now the fact that there was a run-up to the run-up and the drivers behind that I find more squishy than the vaccine news. Will be time for value stocks to shine for a few weeks / months and I’m sure there will be some discounts to be had in tech as the market has less correlation across sectors for a bit. But there is no sign that means to stop investing but agree with you that maybe you want to be more careful. I’ll personally resume DCAing into the broad market after I took a pause right after the election.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-09 17:06:24'] Also, getting back to normal anytime soon assumes the best case scenario, eg no hiccups with vaccine safety, the virus doesnt mutate so that the vaccine doesn’t work anymore. We aren’t out of the woods yet.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-09 20:50:02'] I’m personally not changing anything. I really don’t things will return to normal for a really long time, if ever, so I guess in a sense I’m going against that. Really until a vaccine is effective and used wide spread, I can’t imagine much will get a whole lot better, and I think that’ll be a time away. There’s still going to be too much caution to really support the businesses that are down, and if we do go out enough to support them, it’ll probably lead to a further shut down. We’re too far down the hole. On top of that, the worlds definitely changed. Habits change quick, old normal comes with just as much good and bad as our new normal, minus the virus, I’m meaning more about our habits. A middle ground will likely come between the two. And really this has just cut a lot fat too. It’s ridiculous how underprepared and hurt some of these companies are for the situation. But this is just all my take.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-09 22:08:41'] It might be delusional but if you’re waiting for a major pullback, you’re gonna have a bad time. Non-buyer beware.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 00:30:46'] It's not just the vaccine news, having the election settled is a big weight off everyone's minds. It could be argued to be the bounce from all those months of concentrated anxiety.

We were doing this to protect the elderly and those with preexisting conditions. COVID is as harmless as a cold to a large majority of people, and they have already been manufacturing millions of doses in preparation for regulatory approval, so the moment they get the greenlight they can begin vaccinating the people who need it most. We will be packing concert venues and football stadiums within a month.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 05:05:35'] I'm a bit more concerned about the election results. No one is taking the GOP's legal maneuvers seriously, and while I was one to scoff at them, you now have senior GOP Senators jumping on board the conspiracy theory train, charging that even GOP run election officials in GA ignored their "fraud", etc. The only evidence they seem to have is a convicted child sex offender in PA and now what we know is "faked" viral video down in GA. The fact you have the GSA transition lady stonewalling transition funding until states certify their results in the face of what will end up in thousands of lawsuits--seems to tell me we are headed for a really ugly and protracted transition while Trump draws up his legions of conspiracy theorists into "stop the count". It's anti-democratic. Even if these states do find a few messed up ballots, we already know the fraction of what they find in a recount will not change the outcome of this election. Trump is making this really hard on me to keep sticking my money in U.S.-based company's. An ugly transition could lead to the next stock market bottoming out if any of these conspiracies gain traction or they do find "massive" fraud which, in their heads, had to have happened even though they picked up seats in Congress and may not even lose the Senate majority. Shit is getting insane. Misinformation is everywhere. And this pop for a COVID vaccine that will not even start making its way to the public for months will be premature at best.
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-10 05:09:10'] I'm surprised stocks went out with videly accepted Biden win together with this. Had Trump won stocks would have gone up too. So to me this looks a bit irrational.Also there is harsh lockdown in Europe which will probably push some businesses which struggled in spring with a missed month over the edge.

	COMMENT: ['2020-11-09 11:00:31'] Its not delusional if people feel comfortable putting money back in now as the presidency is predictable and the virus has a light at the end of the tunnel.That said we will know soon if this holds as we are distinctly at a triple top.

POST_TEXT: b'What do you think the best earning plays might be next week. I won last week with Amazon and Google. But lost on Ford.\nWatching both Amazon and Google I saw that it was going down 72 hours before earnings to an extreme point. Shouldve waited until the day of earnings to purchase. I purchased prematurely 48 hours ahead. Couldve had better pricing.\n\nLost 10% on my Ford investment but I know long-term its going to be OK.\n\nI did buy two weeks ago Cleveland-Cliffs when it was about $16.25. Earnings will either exceed todays value or drive it back to $16.25\n\nI am thinking Walmart will be similar to Amazon. Its pulled back from a tire of $145 per share to about $138. It would not surprise me to see it dip to $135 before earnings.  I cant imagine their fourth-quarter being a bad one so it may be worth the opportunity to buy the dip and then sell it after earnings'

Earnings for med tech have been solid, there's a lot of backlog for surgeries and procedures and as omicron cases continue to decrease, operating rooms will start back up. I have friends at huge hospital centers(like Baylor, Einstein, Cleveland) who said that ORs have been shut down, like 1/4 capacity, and despite that med tech has been making impressive revenues and earnings for the most part. I'm not as bullish on pharmaceuticals but still have decent positions in the majors and some biotechs and start ups.

The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserves July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking'

Feels high maybe so just start with a nibble with intent to buy more, higher or lower.Diversify into some of the big s&p names and other index drivers, you're likely missing out on broader market returns. Even though your employer may be exposing you, a few shares of any of the top names may return a lot better without all the fat of the rest of the s&p average driving it down.I see fractional shares aren't possible, so depending on you some of those could be hard to buy.

POST_TEXT: b'While you were debating blueberry smoothie vs. greasy b/e/c on Saturday, the FDA authorized Johnson & Johnsons vaccine for emergency use. \n\nGame = changed. The federal government expects to distribute 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine by the end of June, starting with 4 million this week. On top of the doses provided by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, that means a vaccine will be available to every American adult who wants one by the end of July. \n\nJ&Js vaccine is only one dose and can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, so its ideal for use at drive-thru vaccination sites and with transient population groups, such as those on college campuses. \nIts the Covid era, so you know theres a but. The US is still dealing with new Covid-19 variants, particularly B1351, and the decline in case numbers looks like its plateaued. Plus, the J&J vaccines effectiveness rate is a bit lower than the other two, so public health authorities are worried about people dismissing it as '
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 08:37:33'] Doesn’t make any major changes to JNJ’s business really. I’m long on JNJ, but the perks of this vaccine are solely for the reputation of the brand. But if we look at what it will do for the world, I think it’s great to have another working vaccine.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 08:36:57'] Buy the rumor sell the news. It’s over man
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 09:14:30'] JNJ is selling it cheaply and they are an absolutely massive company. This will have little to no effect on the bottom line. Maybe you get a little bump because of good press but anyone expecting it to rip isn't looking at the reality of the situation.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 08:41:32'] Nice summary. I agree with you, this JNJ vaccine looks to be better suited for younger adults because it is only 1 shot and can help us get the population vaccinated quicker. The downside to the JNJ vaccine is that it was only 66% protective, which is considerably lower than the other 2 vaccines which were >90% effective. Therefore, the populations at risk should stick with the other vaccines.
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 08:58:13'] Any idea how this might affect moderna stock value?
	COMMENT: ['2021-03-01 10:13:59'] Jnj is a good company, has a historical record of success. Unlike Pfizer, which was up down all over the place.Jnj is good for long, good investment. May not have amazing return like Tesla, but it's a stable reliable investment that will gradually and slowly appreciate in value.It pays dividiend, which is extra icing on the cake.

I think the plateau in cases is because it’s warming up, people are getting vaccinated, and cases have been dropping recently so others are feeling more comfortable leaving the house, but these are people who stayed home to prevent spread, not because of their own health. We’re making good headway to getting those 65+ who want it vaccinated. The other thing is a good chunk of the population just don’t want it, so we’ll likely see cases remain at a significant level for a while, but serious complications should mostly go away and resources will be freed up to treat those who do get severe cases.

Yes. Will it be implemented? Depends on the price and the severity of its gastrointestinal side effect profile.Does the diabetic drug have a huge market cap? Yes (https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-insulin-market). Will it be able to capitalise much? Probably (Gvoke is pretty good!). The combination of both insulin and pramlintide is being deveoped by ADOCIA(M1Pram) too.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-16 00:24:55'] This is a legitimately undervalued stock and totally worth buying right now.  I bought an institutional sized position back in the summer and haven't sold a single share, yet even with the run up the current value is still way below where it should be and I continue to buy shares with any free cash.  I strongly believe this company will be an easy buy out in the $20-30 range in 2022 or sooner, although I hope it stays an independent company forever since the company operates in recession proof niches and will continue to make money regardless of what happens in the market.  Solid and growing pipeline, huge potential for XeriJECT and XeriSOL technologies, potential partnerships coming soon, retirement funds have been buying, BlackRock owns 7.5% of the company, and so much more.  Although it could be a volatile coming year, over the next year or two I know we will be up significantly.  Average target price is $12-14 and this only takes into account it's approved products and doesn't take into account the technology that allows the company to reformulate compounds without water and allows the company to store medical compounds without refrigeration like their competitors products (think vaccines or antibodies).

Honestly I would think that BNTX would be the perfect opportunity for you to teach yourself how to value a company. It only has one source of revenue so estimating it's possible future value should be a lot easier than it is for other more complicated companies. That's not to say that estimating future sales of a COVID vaccine will be easy but the fact there is only one variable to consider makes things simpler.

Personally, I'm going to wait and see on the whole thing. If Pfizer doesn't get the deal done (and I still think there's a chance they may not), Pfizer probably goes back to floundering along and being a decent income play. Allergan really hasn't responded all that well to the deal news; I think it may go down a *little* if the deal was off tomorrow, but will probably go on being a pretty decent growth play.

Sold too soon when COVID hit as I was bag holding for 3 years almost If it wasn't for COVID this company would be OTC right now, completely different from Pfizer , a solid company. Biggest problem with nvax is the management, however I recognize it may pump out of nowhere

POST_TEXT: b'Since an insane ammount of money is flowing into healthcare biotech stocks like pfizer and moderna, is there a bigger downside due to worse earnings in the future or is there a positive outlook on the whole sector due to the huge ammount of money that will be used for r&d?'
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 11:16:32'] For me the biotech stocks have been affected by two things. First is expectation of interest rates as everything biotech does is risky affects these stocks quite a bit. Second, they are also counter cyclical at the moment. When my portfolio is down, they tend to go up. Just my observations.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 13:37:40'] No, we can’t talk about healthcare! ):<
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 14:52:48'] healthcare stocks, in general, are a good option. but I'm talking things like United Health, J&J or Eli Lilly, not just trend-chasing for Covid/vaccine related spikes or the latest to-the-moon lotto biotech stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 15:53:53'] Bullish on healthcare. XLV has been on a tear the past few months and still think there’s room to run. Look at the chart of PFE - it just broke out of like a 20 year base above 48. The bigger the base…
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-17 19:32:05'] What most people dont realize is that Moderna had a very unique opportunity from the rest of healthcare companies. The fact that in less than a year they had the chance to test a product that would otherwhise take more than 10 years to get approved by the FDA. On top of that, it proved their technology to be safe and effective. Most likely getting FDA approval in record time from any other med ever created. And generating the capital and name recognition to fund their pretty extensive pipeline of products all based on the same technology... this is incredible IMO. It is like timetraveling for healthcare. This is why it is easy for me to explain their valuation and potential in healthcare. If the HIV vaccine is half as successful as the covid vaccine, It would mean so much to healthcare and science in general. Even the potential to create cancer vaccines is mindblowing. Only this could have made possible by the situation we are in right now. Specifically operation warp speed where all restrictions and liability was lifted by the goverment on top of the billions of dollars pumped to make it happen so fast.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-07 14:21:45'] its funny how moderna is worth almost twice as much, but in my view the pfizer- biontech vaccine will end up selling more. they are estimated 35+ billion compared to 20 billion for moderna. In terms of profits, they are projected to make similar amounts of profit, (biontech gives a portion of sales to pfizer) i understand moderna pipeline is better but not sure its worth 70 billion.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-07 14:22:11'] Price to make the vaccine ~$2.Price they currently sell it for ~$20.Price they plan to sell it for in the future ~$200.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-07 19:47:08'] Revenue is already no surprise, Pfizer reported that $7.8B of covid vaccines were sold, half the revenue is shared with BioNTech, so $3.9B for them. What will matter is the margins which may be higher if they managed to scale up and reduce cost. Also, it's important to look at future vaccine pipeline, moderna's pipeline is further along than BioNTech's

POST_TEXT: b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 10, 2021**\n\nStocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary pressure and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, its worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.\n\nMarket participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be transi'

It’s been reported that in Florida, one of the hardest hit states, DeSantis administration has fudged with the way the covid cases are reported in the last several weeks. You were seeing 20k+ new cases every day and 500+ deaths and then all of a sudden, it goes to less than 10k literally in one day, with a few days of 0 new cases and 0 deaths throw in. It doesn’t make any sense. I think this might be happening in other states as well. These numbers are being underreported.

POST_TEXT: b' \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 22, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed as rising Treasury yields and expectations of higher inflation weighed on equity prices. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.\n\nProspects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental '

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 14:38:06'] The high price came with the expectation that they would continue to lead the market. Pfizer got approval for kid’s vaccines first, and now it’s looks like they will get approval for a pill first. Also Moderna had production problems, at a time when it could have capitalized most. The price of Moderna was no longer justified so it dropped.  The good news is, it went from overpriced to fairly priced, so if you don’t already own it but like the company, it may be a good time to buy. I did this morning and I’m up 9%.  But long term…will Moderna have another winner like the vaccine?

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-05 22:39:39'] I’m a newbie too so I feel for ya. I started beginning of September and quickly became interested in what affected stocks, especially after the evergrande news and the Facebook whistleblower.I used fidelity to create watch lists based on the daily buys and sells by their customers, along with noting the daily % change, any significant news, and if earnings reports were near. Also would take note of what was mentioned on this sub along with r/stockmarket and just watched. Learned very quickly that there’s no predicting the market, at least with individualized stocks.Another thing I like looking at is the biggest daily movers, not something to make decisions on but often times there’s a correlation. For example several biotech companies are down today.Overall, all I’m saying is the more you look into it the more you realize there’s no predicting the market. It’s one of those things you hear constantly but seeing it first hand helped me a lot personally and just furthered my interest. Good luck to ya! Hope none of this came off arrogantly, just wanted to share some things that I found interesting or helpful :)

The other companies have been there for a bit longer, so maybe theres less potential for growth since Covid is coming to a close (I hope). What do you guys think?'

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-21 23:01:10'] You have to keep in mind that Moderna is not just a traditional vaccine company, their end game has been eradicating cancer through the use of vaccines.  They already have a cancer vaccine in trials and they're working on individualized cancer vaccines, tailor made to specific patient.  This is a disruptive technology and they have the great potential to change the medicine .  The COVID somehow accelerated and amplified their capabilities .  Their efficacy after 6 months against the original variant is 93.2% compare to Pfizer 84%.  And against the Delta variant which is 76% to Pfizer 42% .

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-21 20:28:27'] Moderna is legit af.  You gotta recognize that there were what, 4 vaccines or something that ended up being good?  And Moderna made is one of the best.  Pfizer didn't even do it alone, they teamed up with Bio-NTech, which is why bio and pfizer stock are not as high.  They split the profits while Moderna doesn't split with shit.  And now we are ordering booster shots and selling vaxx to other countries and greatly increased prices that were formed in a cartel like fashion similar to OPEC.  Which is good for business.Will they hold onto the mRNA lead?    Likely not.  Just by the numbers.  But they have the lead and will have it for a few more years, that much is likely.  Whats to come from that?  Well to be honest, I'm not hopeful for much.  But that doesn't mean it won't affect investor sentiment.

POST_TEXT: b'OSTK SHIT the bed with a 20% loss today. I looked at an options chain to see 400 volume on only 1 ITM put, but everything else seemed normal. No bad news came out, markets are green af, volume is at its average, options sentiment is not overwhelming in either way from what I quickly glanced at. How does a stock lose 20% of its value for simply no reason? I surely have to be missing something. Can someone enlighten me?'

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-05 12:02:13'] I like NVAX, but one thing to be aware of is that their vaccine is less effective against the South African “EEK” variant (60%) than Pfizer (90%). Also, MRNA vaccines are much easier to update. Not to say that NVAX won’t be successful, but there is some level of competitive disadvantage there. Aside from Pfizer and Moderna, I think Nvax is far better than all the others.

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-05 17:07:50'] I have a short term position .  I prefer their vaccine over most even though I am long on MRNA Moderna (To me, their RNA tech is very promising and they hold the key to cure Cancer and other diseases).  Their vaccine just like J& J and Astra Zeneca does not have logistic issues so they will get easily distributed around the world and they have better efficacy than both of them so they are more desirable plus it’s only one jab.  Another is they planning to make a vaccine that can work on Flu and Covid altogether .  I will definitely trim my position once they get the approval from FDA on their Covid vaccine and will keep an eye on that Combo vaccine.

It's probably the most infallible option in medicine right now. I don't own a position, but on a pull-back it'd make a great long-term hold.

As hospitals are penalized for 'preventable' infections, this is huge. Hospitals will be lining up to buy their product. They also have the capital to get them through production. The FDA is likely going to end their P3 trial early, as the efficacy is already proven. Oh, and to top it all off they ended their P2 trial early by superiority.

POST_TEXT: b'I wanted to share my semi-experienced observations and my own rules I developed for trading biotechs. Apologies for the massive writeup, but I think understanding just one of these key points can immediately translate to not losing a ton of money.\n\nRight upfront, this is an extremely volatile sector with obvious risks. The tradeoff is that it does pay out enormous rewards and high returns are possible without holding through the big headlining binary events (FDA approval, CRL, etc.) I also do not play PDUFAs\n\nSo right away, a couple of things.\n\n1. **By being long on a company, you are also holding a long or short position on its competitors.** As a very recent example, Iveric Bio doubled overnight because its competitor Apellis Pharmaceutical reported disappointing trial results for their own drug. So you have to know the drug, and its similarities to the rival drug for the same ailment, and know the presentation schedule of all the data involved.\n2. **Partnership/buyouts are incredibl'
	COMMENT: ['2021-10-08 14:43:19'] Appreciate this. I'm very interested in the sector, and following a number of companies is just wild. There are such huge spikes and drops, it can make it really hard to figure out where to entry and exit (aside from just playing FDA).When do you tend to buy and sell yourself? Do you tend to just get in post-dilution and then sell after a spike or do you hold any longer term?

It seems market participants have looked past the Federal Reserves July meeting minutes, which included language signaling that tapering may begin sooner rather than later, and continue to digest Q2 record-breaking earnings season and new developments coming out of Washington D.C. Looking ahead, market participants await Fed Chair Jerome Powell annual Jackson Hole speech, scheduled this Friday morning.\n\nThis earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%.

POST_TEXT: b"Hi guys has anyone done this and been happy? I'm tempted to do some sells and reinvest in trading 212 as they have A LOT more stocks to deal with.\n\nOr I might just keep what I have in etoro and anything new I buy goes into trading 212. Anyone have any personal opinions about that platform?"
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 13:21:32'] It cant be worse than etoro? I mean apart from spx all the spreads were terrible and often had trouble buying and selling when big swings happened
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 13:29:48'] Works fine for me. Was a definite outage like funsail said when the Pfizer vaccine was announced and America opened same today but not as bad. Considering it’s transaction fee free it’s pretty good
	COMMENT: ['2020-11-16 13:22:35'] I was on freetrade before switching to trading212 and it's definitely better. Works well but there was a notable outage recently during market open when the Pfizer vaccine came out so something to be weary about. But overall it's very good so I'd recommend it

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 03:38:24'] Definition of falling into value traps. Sometimes a stock goes down because it's a bad buy and it's going down further.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 05:05:49'] hm. maybe buy an S&P etf and be done with it ?   just something to ponder about.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 01:24:41'] Or, you know, you could also be red as the 52wk high was probably also the ATH. Who knows.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 03:45:02'] this is why pros makes fun of reddit... jfc
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 01:27:19'] Nice list thanks.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 07:03:50'] cool now how many of those are good companies

	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 10:01:12'] I mean yeah, my new investments are mostly green. That doesn't mean my portfolio is...
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 14:19:04'] If it were this easy, everyone would be rich.  By all means, lead by example and let us know your results in 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-07 13:36:27'] This is actually a popular and effective way to START your DD. Lots of them are sinking ships, but lots aren’t. I like Tesla, amd, and Marathon on this list. Only own one, the other two are an my watch list.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 02:00:56'] Interesting outside of the box strategy.
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 04:38:53'] Couple good ones on the list but there's also a couple dumpster fires. If I did somewhat apply this strategy I would pick smaller size group and hold long term
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 07:27:19'] Moving averages are more reliable to trade by than 52 week highs. But one indicator also isn’t enough to invest and should be taken into context with many different factors
	COMMENT: ['2021-04-06 08:22:57'] Where do you find it probable as opposed to 50/50?

POST_TEXT: b'Background:\n\n$PRDS is a biotech company developing an antiviral pill similar to Pfizers Paxlovid. It just completed its merger with FSII this past Thursday. Yesterday was its first day trading under the new ticker. Its completing Phase I trials and plans to move to Phase II and III trials in the first half of 2022. \n\nThesis:\n\nWith a market cap of $600-700m and an EV of just ~$400M, the stock appears cheap on its own. It has a promising antiviral drug with a substantial TAM that, if successful, would likely yield sales equal to many multiples of the current market cap each year (for Pfizers drug, analysts are estimating tens of billions in sales per year). The company claims its drug could be superior to Pfizers, because it doesnt require a booster of an HIV drug to be taken concurrently, like Pfizers does. Those HIV drugs have a high level of interactions with other drugs, including common statins, which can limit its appeal to certain segments of the market. \n\nOther positive f'

	COMMENT: ['2021-12-29 09:14:42'] Now closer to $13 a share… Still plenty of room to go
	COMMENT: ['2021-12-30 10:29:19'] Let’s hope so, friend. I bought 500 shares before the merger. I would take $200 all day lol
